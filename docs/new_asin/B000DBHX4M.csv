2474496,4,B000DBHX4M,"I really enjoyed this movie. It is very adventurous, funny and you just don't know what to expect form one moment to the other. Also the SFX are excellent and mostly done with real miniature without heavy use of CGI (which I don't care for, the CGI that is...). Overall: VERY GOOD!",1140393600,,281,4.423076923076923
2474497,4,B000DBHX4M,"How is ""Zathura"" different from ""Jumanji""?  Let me count the ways.  First, this one is about a game that takes you to outer space instead of a game that brings the jungle to you.  Actually that would be two key differences, so since I have messed this up already let me get to the most significant difference, which is that this one is about a pair of bickering brothers where as the other was another opportunity for Robin Williams to run around crazy (which always has its moments).  It might seem strange that the main attraction in a film filled with special effects turns out to be a couple of brothers being mean to each other in a way that only brothers can be, but a fantasy has to be grounded in reality to really touch an audience and that is what happens with these two kids.

On a dad weekend Walter (Josh Hutcherson) is being incessantly bugged by his younger brother, Danny (Jonah Bobo).  While dad is out of the house and their older sister Lisa (Kristen Stewart) is lost beneath her headphones, Danny finds the Zathura game and gets his brother to play.  As the first move is completed a card pops out warning them to take cover from a meteor shower and the next minute that is exactly what they are doing.  Then they discover the house is in outer space and the only way to get home is to keep playing the game.  Unless, of course, the house is destroyed by Zorgons before they get that far.  The one constant as the two brothers continue to play the game is the way that they keep going at each other, and even when an adult (Dax Shepherd) enters the game, Danny and Walter are not going to stop.

I was really struck by how different ""Zathura"" was from ""Jumanji"" right up tot he moment that I became aware of the most significant thing they have in common.  Jon Favreau (who is currently working on ""John Carter of Mars,"" which it looks like will actually come out before we get to the centennial for ERB's pulp fiction adventure) focuses on the story of Chris Van Allsburg's book more than his drawings, which makes perfect sense even though if they figure out a way to animate one of his books so that those exquisite pencil drawings come to life that would blow everybody away.  As an object lesson ""Zathura:The Space Adventure"" might be over the top, but when you have kids who fight like cats and dogs something that metaphorically hits them over the head really hard is sometimes what is needed.  Unfortunately, kids who need a lesson like that will be too caught up in the idea of playing the game that getting the message of this 2005 film.",1140307200,,2567,4.4225053078556265
2474498,4,B000DBHX4M,"Ten years after Jumanji (1995) the idea of a board game reanimating itself by reemerging in the refurbished space cadet version called Zathura comes to life.  The idea of reusing the idea initially seems clichd, especially when it comes from the same source, as Chris Van Allsburg wrote both stories.  Initially, I also thought that director Jon Favreau had run out of ideas, as he had to give the concept a face-lift.  Regardless of what Favreau thought, it will undoubtedly hurt the films novelty.  However, the film still succeeds in bringing forth a terrific tale of forgiveness, family, and hope for the whole family.

The six-year-old Danny (Jonah Bobo) often finds himself being far less skilled in several activities common for children than his slightly older brothers Walter (Josh Hutcherson).  Danny's skill discrepancy has become a major issue in his life and has brought on low self-esteem, as his brother exploits the situation by showing off.  Their father, performed by Tim Robbins, tries to balance his attention equally among them, work, deadlines, and the time they do not live with their mother.  It is a difficult job for him while trying to provide the best possible home for them.  Nonetheless, Danny finds himself physically and emotionally bullied by Walter, as he most of the time finds him annoying.  Yet, they spend a lot of time together, which forces Walter to pay attention to Danny and play with him.  On occasion they are left on their own, as they are in this story when their father has return to work and leaves them under their older sister's supervision.  However, she is far too self-centered and focuses most on getting her beauty sleep.

After one of the sibling's skirmishes, Walter sends Danny to the basement where he discovers an old board game called Zathura.  Danny brings the game to the living room where he wants to play the game with his brother, but Walter is completely uninterested.  Without anyone to play with, Danny opens and begins to play by himself, awe how the game initially operates.  After his piece has moved by some old fashion machinery inside the game, a card materializes out of the game.  The card says, ""METEOR SHOWER.  Take evasive action.""  Unaware what he activated, Danny seeks shelter together with his brother, as the living room is bombarded by small burning meteors that cut through the room like rocks through air.  In shock, the two brothers begin to realize what has just happened, as they must now finish what Danny has set in motion.

It sends Danny and Walter on an amazing journey where they are about to test their affection and caring for one another.  The dangers that emerge could have costly consequences, but with the right decisions they might just get through the perilous adventure of the Zathura game.  Throughout the story, the audience will learn several valuable lessons of forgiveness, understanding, and compassion among others.  What is even more intriguing is that the story is told through the eyes of a child, which enhances its fascination for the younger viewers.  Furthermore, the hazardous events in the film bring about an adult and childish atmosphere at the same time, which undoubtedly further children's interest to the story.  In retrospect, Zathura might present an already used idea, but the story is far more elaborated than Jumanji.  It makes me wish that this were the first time I saw the concept, which might have made me love this already terrific science fiction tale even more.

Jon Favreau truly loves his calling, and Zathura radiates this throughout the whole film.  However, the reuse of the coming alive board game from Jumanji hurts the overall cinematic experience, yet it is still a wonderful tale with suspense, drama, and entertainment for all ages.  In essence, Zathura is a definitely a film I would strongly recommend to younger viewers and for older people to see in order to find their younger selves once again.",1140134400,3,3952,4.934947049924357
2474499,4,B000DBHX4M,"Well it's been a good couple of weeks for family and family-rated films out on DVD these past couple of weeks.  We've gotten the amazing and utterly joyful Wallace and Gromit in the Curse of the Wererabbit, we've gotten the magical and rich world of MirrorMask, and we've gotten the science fiction bonanza of Zathura.

The latter film and the focus of this little review is a story about a breaking home, two brothers in a divorced family that argue all of the time and can't seem to be comfortable with each other and who, eventually, must work out their differences in a pretty magnificent and original way: tearing apart the home pane-by-pane as they shoot through outer-space playing a board game.

Which is interesting, if you think about it, the whole theme of broken home/horrors of nature that the characters experience in this film and in Jumanji, it's counterpart.  It's not a big theme, it's just something that's there, but both groups of children have relatively unhappy homelifes and they both play a board game that realizes their fears and causes them to grow up, in a sense.

In terms of any realness to this picture, some people might feel stuff a bit lacking.  You know, they can breathe in space, the couch keeps burning after it leaves the atmosphere of the living room, so on and so forth.  Actual physics has next to nothing of importance in this film, but what it does have is pretty amazing special effects... as in, really, I couldn't see through any of them.  Huh, weird, since much bigger and more appreciated films with much bigger budgets tend to have very obvious special effects and an entire lack of a plot, too!  State of contemporary film, people.

The only thing really a problem with this film, if one considers it a problem, is that the character of Lisa is pretty underdeveloped and actually helps undermine a lot of what the boys discover about trust and growing up.  However, she becomes such a minor character that it's mostly incidental, so if she bothers you she's easier to ignore.  Then, of course, it's kind of hard to imagine any house taking that much abuse and still stand, right to the very end, even taking into account the lack of care for physics and reality in it.  So if those are issues that really bother you, I guess you'll just have to be bothered.

2474500,4,B000DBHX4M,"Open up your imagination to the world of Zathura. Kids and adults alike will revel in this great story about two young brothers who find an old board-style game called Zathura that literally launches them and their home into outer-space. Danny and Walter are the brothers and when their father leaves them alone with their teenage sister for a few minutes, worlds collide and their home becomes a space-bound asteroid, but not because of any interstellar cataclysm. It's all related to the game Zathura that the younger Danny finds and begins playing.

Their father's beautiful arts and crafts style home is magically transported to the nether reaches of space and as the boys play the game - in an attempt to get back to Earth - more and more bizarre occurrences happen. A meteor shower pummels the house. A defective robot tries to kill the elder brother, Walter. Zorgons, weird, space-faring lizard-men, track their home because of the warmth radiating off it. A stranded spaceman joins the duo and has much more vested in the game than we could ever imagine. Walter and Danny's sister goes into cryogenic sleep for ""five turns"" only to awaken in the midst of this spaceflight odyssey.

Can the boys make it home? Will they be able to finish the game? Can they put aside their sibling rivalries and become loving brothers? Why is the stranded astronaut helping them? What will Dad say when he gets home and finds out there is no home?

_______________________________________________________________________________________

There's been a lot of controversial talk amongst film-o-philes about this movie and JUMANJI. There's no doubt that there's an incredibly strong similarity between the two (a house being overrun by animals versus space creatures; a family in crisis that's forced to come together; a board game that recreates a fantasy; a happy ending that gets fixed-up before adults arrive back in the picture; and so on).

Regardless of those striking comparisons, Zathura is a really fun film to watch. The two brothers are believable, and when they fight it reminded me of the great arguments I had with my brothers when I was growing up.

The amazingly beautiful arts and crafts home. It was painful watching it get destroyed piece by piece. Sitting on a gimbal, too, it was surprising (watching the special features on the DVD) to learn that director Jon Favreau used minimal digital special effects and built miniatures, etc. in order to get the desired effects for the film.

The ridiculous nature of the story allowed me to suspend disbelief and just go with it. We all know that fire doesn't burn in outer-space (they light a sofa on fire and kick it out the door), and that a person could never survive fifteen years floating around in space in a spacesuit (the astronaut), but so what.

I was also a tad surprised about the astronaut. I'd surmised quite a bit about the movie as it continued (being able to guess pretty easily what was going to happen next and why) but when the true nature of the stranded astronaut came to light, I felt a bit choked-up (yeah, yeah, I know).

So sit back and enjoy the film, and try not to get overly critical about its obvious relation to JUMANJI.",1140048000,10,3206,4.857142857142857

In the UK the Film has not even been released so while Americans can Buy the DVD in a few weeks time if you Search

www.amazon.co.uk you will not find any Information on  Zathura at all.

Although not applicable to  Zathura I have seen British Films filmed in Britain but the DVD version has only been released to America and it can take up to two Years before the Studio allows the ' Rest of The World ' to see it.

The European Union  has a higher  GDP {  Gross domestic product } than America and the EU is ranked First in the World by the World Bank but for some strange reason American Studios still believe that the American market is larger.

2474503,4,B000DBHX4M,"I like the movie ""Jumanji."" I don't think it's a great film, but it was a fairly decent movie. The special effects haven't held up quite as well as they used to, but that's okay, that's just the way things work sometimes. With that in mind, I wasn't particularly looking forward to seeing ""Zathura."" Like ""Elf,"" the movie just looked too dopy and childish for me. However, like ""Elf,"" I walked away from ""Zathura"" quite surprised. I only then learned that the guy who directed ""Elf"" directed ""Zathura"" too.

The storyline is simple: Boys who hate each other find board game, start playing, weird stuff happens, boys must learn to love each other if they are to survive. In this regard, ""Zathura"" is nothing special, as this story has been told multiple times before. What makes this movie worth seeing is that it is told in a very fun way. While ""Jumanji"" was a good movie, calling it a family film (and giving the film it's too flexible PG rating) was a joke, as that film was capable of terrifying kids. ""Zathura"" makes this a fun ride by establishing very early on that this is going to be a fun fantasy ride.

The first thing that happens is a huge meteor shower takes place in the living room. The meteors fall everywhere, destroying the room, but the kids are unharmed. So while it looks like the kids are avoiding the meteors, it's really the meteors that are avoiding the kids. This scene does a great job in setting up the fact that this is all just going to be fun. As more disasters show up, there is always something to protect the kids, and (in a brilliant stroke of genius) some of the special effects are old fashioned. The old fashioned special effects (like the robot) helps establish the fantasy setting we are in.

The actors all do a commendable job in the movie. There is no Oscar work to be found here, but what is in here works. Save for Tim Robbins in a very minor supporting role as the dad who doesn't have for his kids, the cast is made up entirely of unknowns. This is also okay, as we don't want anyone mistaking this movie for art. Still, it's a great family film, and even if you don't have kids it is quite and enjoyable ride in itself. Just remember: It's only a game.",1137801600,2,2201,4.402948402948403

I thought this was great, yeah... a little reminiscent of Jumanji and apparently this movie is a sequel in the books to Jumanji but I liked this so much better. I do NOT care for Kristen Stewart and her terrible acting, but in this I didn't mind her, half because they take her out of part of it and also the humor surrounding her character.

Judge this for its own merits.  Younger kids might find it intense, on the other hand, I've seen the garbage 'parents' let their young children watch, so...

It's the story of two brothers who end up on a space adventure.  Yes it's a feel good movie with a happy ending, which I like because there aren't too many of those left out there.
It's a novelty movie, fun graphics for what I would consider to be a low-budget film, and even some humour.

2474603,4,B000DBHX4M,"Edgar Rice Burroughs had his Tarzan of the jungle and John Carter of Mars and Chris Van Allsberg has his Jumanji (1995) with its jungle setting and Zathura (2005) which is set in space. If you've seen and enjoyed Jumanji you'll probably enjoy Zathura.

Both are generally based on children's adventure stories of the same names by Chris Van Allsberg. The book version of Jumanji was published in 1981 while the book version of Zathura was published in 2002.

Both movies involve the discovery of powerful games which seem to change the reality in which the players live. In Zathura the adventures take place in space and involve the dangers offered by space as well as alien life forms who want to eat the players. There are also some plot surprises which lend a little mystery to the story.

Zathura is good family fun and provides a pleasant evening's entertainment for all ages. It is rated PG which may be due to some intense scenes involving the aliens and space. It is going to be enjoyed most by children between the ages of 6 and 12 and to some extent by the older members of the family whose inner child is alive and well.",1359331200,2,1131,4.534313725490196

There is a very human element with siblings who fight like cat and dog in real life but pull together to survive through the Zathura board game experience. The older sister and the handsome astronaut give it a greater interest to younger teenagers too.

2474626,3,B000DBHX4M,"The plot and movie actually aren't bad (for a kid's movie).  It's very creative, much like Jumanji.

BUT Hollywood's nearly 100% tendency to fill its ""kids"" movies with nasty brats and dysfunctional families ruins this film.  They really push the envelope here.  The jerky older brother (played irritatingly by Josh Hutcherson) gets so obnoxious that I end up not caring about his poor misunderstood childhood and want him to get eaten by the Zorgons (alien lizards).  He treats his little brother like dirt and casually disregards everything that any adult tells him to do.  His sister is likewise pushing-the-envelope obnoxious, but thankfully is asleep for 1/3 the film and gets frozen for another 1/3.  The only ""likeable"" character is the little brother played by Jonah Bobo, who is the stereotypical Hollywood little-kid (precocious, long hair), but he also tends to disregard what adults say in a very irritating fashion.

Of course there is maximum havoc and just as you think that all is lost (in space), everyone comes home safe-and-sound before the patsy Dad comes home.  The big plot twist is how an astronaut boards their spacecraft home and surprise! turns out to be the older brother from the future.

But about the only significant thing that I recall from thinking about watching this movie is the extreme obnoxiousness of the Hollywood family.  I seem to remember the older brother callously calling his little brother ""BEEYOTCH,"" which makes you want to reach through the screen and slap him on his head. QUESTION:  can Hollywood EVER depict an intact American family that is not beset by divorce, death of one of the parents, spoiled brats out-of-control, and dysfunction?",1275350400,4,1692,5.068592057761733

Shirley Temple...if she could do it at age 7 (very well by the way), than one actor with charisma could do movies like this one. It's not entirely believable script but it's creative and I like the sarcasm.

The older brother was not a very good actor compared to his younger brother. That was until the Astronaut (Dax Shepard) came in......the older brother still weren't All that great but his younger brother and the Astronaut should have won an Emmy, a Golden globes, and a VIP ticket to the MTV movie awards were everyone claps and cheers on Que.

The above sentence may have been a little sarcasm but J. Favreau and C. Allsburg have Creative talent.  Four starts; nothing more because IMO they should have hired Macaulay Culkin from Home Alone.

The only complaint I have is that I found the depiction of the teenage girl extremely sexist - and I am not a feminist!  She was shown in visually sexual manner and as extremely self-centered.  If the objective of the character's portrayal was to depict how a teenage sister might be seen by their younger brothers, the part was very well played by the young actress.  If the part was scripted to sex up the movie or include some off-beat humor, I suspect many would find the portrayal offensive.

The acting skills of the two main protagonists (the two brothers) were great, and those two boys really made me believe they were brothers.  Josh Hutcherson's acting skills were absolutely great, and if you are a fan of him, then you will not be disappointed by this film at all.  If you liked Jumanji, then you will like this film, but the thing that sets this apart is the universal themes such as sibling rivalry and family problems.  The cast of characters really worked well together, and the Dax Shephard character (the astronaut) had a big surprise towards the end of the film.  The universal themes to which I had referred is what made me as the viewer get invested with the characters and develop a connection with them.  While Tim Robbins had a cameo role in this film he really did a good job with providing a good setting for the family situation.

One thing that I loved about this film was the combination of old fashioned special effects along with CGI.  As a result, the film seemed realistic unlike CGI nightmares like the original ""Hulk"" film which made me get bored seeing how fake it was.  After watching the special features and seeing how the film was made especially made me appreciate the hard work that all of the actors, most especially the two youngest ones, did in this film.

The sister character was great, and though Kristen Stewarts time in this film was short she still was enjoyable.  I suppose it is quality over quantity with regards to her appearance.

To sum up, this film really made me look at things in my own life and see how the worst of times can either make or break us.  The storyline and acting was great by everyone in this film, and this film is really deep and not empty fantasy movie.",1255996800,,1815,4.496951219512195

2474642,5,B000DBHX4M,"Lots of films with kids in lead roles feature inept dialog, bad acting, poor shooting and/or little or no plot, or are thinly disguised morality tales. Despite its not lighting up the Hollywood skies with box office success, Zathura is one of those rare and delightful exceptions that is really worth taking the time to see.

The film starts out showing the belligerent behavior of a 10 year old boy towards his younger brother, and the 6 year old's response, during a front yard game of catch with their father. After Dad goes out for an errand, the 6 year old finds a ""space"" game in the basement - Zathura - and his older brother resentfully agrees to play it with him. It turns out that the game changes reality - as they learn when a meteor shower hits the living room, followed by the discovery that their house is now orbiting what appears to be a fiery planet.

The boys overcome increasingly terrifying challenges as the movie progresses, learning to trust and love each other (and themselves) more and more, as they work to protect each other as each new catastrophe occurs.

Their older sister joins in and learns to love and trust her younger siblings as well, though she doesn't have a significant role until the latter half of the film - a side effect of being cryogenically frozen by the game early-on (and the source of several humorous moments and sight gags during the course of the film).

Without being ""preachy"", the film provides strong lessons on the value and importance of family, and of working together to solve problems.

The performances of all of the actors are superb and very believable. The writing, direction and special effects are all excellent. Humorous moments and dialog, some of it REALLY funny, kept the audience laughing throughout the film, and helped to lighten things up in between some of the really intense scenes.

This is a ""must-see"" film, right up there with the best children's films I've ever seen. Even so, due to the intensity, I would not recommend it for very young children (5-6 years of age or under), and some older pre-teens should probably see the film with an adult.

Given that the film hits the mark in terms of quality, provides an excellent message of the importance of family, does a good job of reaching its intended audience, and treats them with respect, I'll give it 5 stars: good entertainment, and a ""must have"" for any parent's DVD collection.",1237766400,2,2418,4.702127659574468

There may be a handful of offensive words during the movie with the worst being d#@k I believe.

When a playing card says ""meteor shower,"" a hail of burning stones pummels their living room. Also, you should see the new view from the house's front door ...

Each new turn in the game adds to the adventure, which is pretty much all the movie is about. Oh, a sibling rivalry gets resolved along the way, but that seems an afterthought, pasted on so the plot has some kind of beginning and ending. An overbearing older sister in a permanent snit figures in, too, but just barely - the game sidelines her early on, then brings her back when a girly bit of screaming seems appropriate.

I haven't read Van Allsburg's children's book, the one that this movie comes from, so I can't say anything about the adaptation. That aside, this movie offers good commodity entertainment. It's kid-friendly (as long as your kid isn't too skittish), with enough action to keep a grown-up from falling asleep. If it never rises above the ""rainy afternoon"" category, that's fine.

One such film was ""Jumanji"" where the special effects have aged considerably since its release but the charm and even spectacle of it all makes it better even while you might scoff many times. Well essentially we have that movie set in space with this film, a ""Jumanji: The Galaxy Edition"" if you will, and while the similarities are quite obvious and the effects have gotten better, it still feels to familiar though kids might have a blast with it.

Walter and Danny are 2 brothers dealing with their parent's divorce and father's working. Walter wants attention from his dad to play catch and wants nothing to do with his brother while Danny just wants his brother to play with him. But with dad gone and sister upstairs sleeping, they learn to work together when Danny finds a board game called ""Zathura"" that brings with it meteor showers and the house flying through space complete with strange and dangerous events every time one takes a turn.

Yeah, you can see the parellels to Jumanji already huh? The board game, reading the next event (off a card instead of a glass center, the dealings with a cheater and someone who escapes from the game because of a roll, sorry...button press) and if you remember what happens when someone wins the board game in the other one well you can tell what's in this one. But aside from the similarities, the problem is the film is kind of - but not all the time - irritating, mainly due to the brother's. They spent so much time bickering and arguing that Tim Robbin's exasperation early on doesn't seem like an overreaction at all. While there's lots to ogle at, the characters themselves just don't have a lot of appeal.

However, the film certainly looks great to look at with an early meteor shower, an encounter to close to a star and the end sequence being highlights. Since a good chunk of it was done without just going straight to the computers was everything is welcome. The acting when it's not being grating, works and looking at Kristen Stewart any chance I can made the film better but the lack of suspense throughout the whole film and just being little mini-episodes till the end hurts and the ""villain"" doesn't have a real sense of threat Jonathan Hyde brought to Jumanji. But I'm nitpicking and I certainly don't want to seem like I'm making that film to be perfectly awesome but when compared to this one, what it lacks in effects makes up for it in key areas.

I'd recommend Zathura since ultimately it is a family movie and such criticisms tend to get thrown out the door when you watch but when you start really watching, then stuff gets noticed. So it's best to just go along with it.",1210377600,,2792,4.544731610337972

The movie travels though time and adventure saving not only the initial characters but two orphaned kids from their orphaness.  Real excitement, real adventure, real tears.
This Zathura movie has no emotional connection, just overtly bratty kids, with cute kid shots disbursed ad nauseum throughout the movie.  This movie brings nothing but emptiness.  A frozen sister in hot pants underwear, a stupid young kid who supposedly is so smart but won't continue with a game that obviously will solve all the problems and then in the midst of all this banal nothingness a card is drawn that allows any wish to be granted; and the kid wishes for a football with Brett Favre autograph, are the writers of this screenplay medicated or just as stupid as the characters in this movie.

2474662,1,B000DBHX4M,"Now I have nothing against kids movies, especially those that send a message. Back in the 80's and 90's kids movies used to be enjoyable. This movie, however was more annoying than enjoying. The thing that I hate about kids movies now adays is that they are ssooooo corny!

Jumanji was not corny at all. It had realistic dialogue, action scenes, the scenes simply flow and the fact it had robbin williams in it put it on top. Im not saying that it was the best movie ever but it did have all he elements that make movies enjoyable. Heartwarming, action, realistic dialogue, and robin williams(he he). But most of all it was enganging.

This movie was not engaging. It was boring. On top of that it was corny. Oh and no action. In jumanji there was action. Stampedes, lions, monsoons, vine swinging... In this movie all you see is one kid running from point A to point B, then back to point A and then back to point B while the other kid watches. And then they switch turns. Boring and predictable.

Also, unlike jumanji, ther was no real danger here. Oh sure there were robots, aliens, and meteors but robot was stupid and slow he couldn't eve run as fast as the 10 year old. The aliens were also stupid and they had terrible aim. It was hard to tell whether they were trying to destroy the kids or the house because with all its ""advanced technology"" it still could not hit the kids worth crap. I know that I am supposed to give this movie a break since it is a ""kids"" movie but uh, no, Im not gonna give it any break. This movie was terrible. I couldn't even watch it all the way through it was so bad.

The main thing that I didn't like about this movie was the fact none of the characters were likable. None of them. I liked all the characters in jumanji. None of the were annoying brats. But whatever, if you want see this movie for yourself go ahead. I wouldnt recommend it to any one.",1189296000,5,1891,4.288515406162465
2474663,2,B000DBHX4M,"I hadn't even been conceived back in 1959.  That was about when my mom was still in school.  Nonetheless, I sat down during my teenage years every afternoon after school to watch the episodes of ""The Twilight Zone"" I'd taped the night before (via timer) off the sci-fi channel, because I loved the formula.  That formula?  Suspension of disbelieve = 1.
By this I mean that the audience will only really have to suspend their disbelief for one thing.  One element.  One plot point that dominates the episode later.  One thing alone about the world you're about to be vaulted into is different or unnatural.
The same was true of Jumanji.  Basically, there is a board game (presumably a cursed board game, as it weilds magic against the gamers,) that you must play to the end, or else its ""interesting effects"" will never go away.
Of course, Jumanji took those effects from a fictitious jungle environment, more dangerous than any jungle on earth, but Zathura is a slightly different kind of game.  This one is a space exploration game, and starting the game vaults anyone who plays it, along with, presumably, everything in their immediate vicinity, into the spaceborne world of Zathura.  The long and short is that two quarreling brothers start playing the game and find themselves and their house stranded in outer space.
Now, I've seen many good reviews for this movie, and I'm sorry mine must be so... harsh, but I didn't enjoy Zathura as much as I enjoyed Jumanji for one reason above all others.
That reason is that frankly, the scriptwriting stunk.
I'm not talking about the dialogue between the boys or the dialogue of their father or their sister, or some of the dialogue of the mysterious astronaut, who appears later on.  Much of the dialogue was actually very realistic, which is more than can be said for most kids movies.  Problems seem to have only arisen in dialogue when it pertains to the game and its effects, which occur more and more frequently as the movie progresses.
For one thing, the behavior of children when vaulted into outer space by a mad board game would be considerably different than what is shown in this movie.  In Jumanji, the behaviors of the kids (and adults) playing the game was actually quite realistic.  The girl who plays the game of Jumanji reacts realistically to the game's warning with an ""un-oh.  I didn't see this part.""  Then from then on, the kids realize that it is of the utmost importance that one of them finish the game if they want to be rid of the horrible dangers it's been visiting upon them.
In this movie, the very real, life-threatening dangers are put on the back burner in the children's minds, as their conflicts with one another take precidence.  For instance, the whole scene where the older brother complains that the younger one ""cheated"" to move himself ahead a number of spaces, and not even the astronaut has the wherewithall to note that if cheating were possible, they should all try it, since who ""wins"" doesn't matter.  What matters is that they don't all lose.
Children quarrel easily, and can be remarkably foolish and stubborn.  This I freely admit, but if they are in mortal danger, they will stand up and harken to it first, before trying to find someone to blame.  This was done in Jumanji, but not Zathura.  I think the scriptwriters on this movie were either being pestered by their own quarreling children WHILE they wrote this script, or else had just come off reading ""lord of the flies"" and decided that all children are barbaric and less intelligent than squirrels; which at least have the basic animal instinct to react to danger until the danger is past.
Indeed, I have to say that since this is really only a problem when the game gets involved, I almost found myself wishing the game had never been in the movie, and that it had just been a movie about two brothers learning about each other while being left alone in a house with their irresponsible sister, which is a shame, since the game is kinda supposed to be what the whole movie is about, right?
Of course, this is the biggest problem with this movie (unrealistic dialogue,) but there are other shortcomings it has that Jumanji lacked.  At least, these things are shortcomings in my mind.
First, I think the fact that the boys adventure takes place entirely in another world didn't really help things any.  Realistically, they sort of had to do it that way, in order for it to be a space exploring game, but I kind of prefer the effect when there's some scenery to worry about beyond one house, a starfield and a few alien ships.  I always liked the scenes in Jumanji where the stampeding animals ran through town and stomped all over that one car.  They could have at least visited another planet or something and showed some scenery like that.
However, more importantly, the game (I know we're supposed to suspend our disbelief regarding the game, but this bothered me) seems to appear just before the younger brother finds it, and disappear just after they finish.  It's apparently been lying in the basement of their house (an old house, admittedly, but it's not like someone tried to get rid of it, like they did Jumanji,) visible behind the stairs in that basement to anyone who turns around to walk up them.  It would have made a whole lot more sense (at least to me,) if the game had been found by the younger brother in a crater in a local park or something; all that remained of a meteorite.  Plus, I just thought that up on the spot.  You could also do a lot of other origin stories that make even more sense.  Aliens drop it off to get rid of it, it comes from the future due to a time warp, it was manufactured by a race of spacefaring immortals and lost by one of their children... the list goes on.  The game has no origin, and it easily could.  How much imagination does it really take?
However, and this bothered me a lot more, the game is left on the floor where anyone could get at it after they win.  What, do they WANT somebody to come along and get lost in space after they've just barely escaped with their lives?  It was another thing about their behavior that didn't add up.  At least bury it in the backyard or something.
I've already commented on the lack of scenery, but let me do so once more.  Even at the beginning and ending of the movie, where you get to see the yard and street connected to the house, the camera never dares to zoom into someone else's yard and the script never calls for the boys to go off the property for any reason, and it fades out just as they're about to leave the lot at the end of the movie.  Disappointing.  This isn't the Sims, for goodness sake.  It's okay to show the neighborhood (unless the neighborhood pulled out of the movie at the last minute.)
But I think the worst thing, for me, wasn't the confined space of this movie (irony there... sorta...) but the fact that there really weren't any action sequences at all.  Children fighting with giant, poison misquitos and spiders is an action sequence.  Robin Williams fending off an african lion is an action sequence.  These kids typically aren't called upon to do anything but run from one place to another, pick things up, carry them, put them down, break some furniture, and hold up cards.  For those who are familiar with beer, let me say that this movie felt like Jumanji Lite; not as exciting to make it go down easier.
Indeed, Zathura goes down easy, and that's my issue.  I know this movie clearly was intended for kids after having watched it, but I'm pretty sure Jumanji was too, and it was also enjoyable to adults.  It took a stupid, unrealistic, silly and impossible piece of subject matter and did as much with it as was humanly possible at the time, achieving the delicate balance of stressing the character traits and life experiences of the characters it portrays, but not allowing those traits to take center stage, watermarking them over the mortal danger, or really even letting them distract the viewers from the centerpiece of the movie.
Long and short, Jumanji was better.  The graphics and sound have improved over the last decade, but that's to be expected.  Graphics and sound quality are pretty much all this film had on Jumanji.  I won't say it's a downright bad film, because there are enjoyable elements to it, and a kid might like it more than I (an artist) do, but after having seen it once, I can't picture myself purchasing it.",1183075200,,8430,4.581225033288948

In this case, the name of the board game is Zathura, which is found by the youngest of two rivaling brothers: Walter (Josh Hutcherson) who is 10 years old and Danny (Jonah Bobo) who is 6 years old.  Walter, Danny and their older teenage sister Lisa (Kristen Stewart) are the children of recently divorced parents.  The children's mother is never shown, but their father (Tim Robbins) does his best to spend time with the boys in spite of his busy work schedule.  It is when the father has to leave on the weekend to attend a meeting that Walter & Danny get into a heated argument as Walter really can't stand Danny and repeatedly accuses Danny of cheating in just about everything.  Danny tried to hide from Walter inside of an old dumbwaiter built into their father's old house.  Walter finds Danny and lowers him into the dark basement, which frightens Danny considerably.  In the basement, Danny finds the courage to come out of the dumbwaiter and it is there that he find the box containing the Zathura board game under the stairs leading back up into the house.  Danny brings the game upstairs to see if Walter will play with him as they are both bored and not happy that their father had to leave.  It is when Danny starts to the play the game that the sci-fi fantasy begins as their father's house is magically transported into space near a ringed & multi-mooned planet resembling Saturn.  Walter & Danny try desperately to get help from Lisa, but thinking that it's dark outside, she runs into the bathroom to get ready for a date.  In the meantime, the boys continue to play, which only allows more unusual & dangerous things to occur, such as the appearance of a mad robot, lizard-like aliens and a mysterious astronaut (Dax Shepard).  With Walter & Danny continuing to fight and Danny being reluctant to continue to play, will any of them ever see home again?

Directed by Jon Favreau, with extravagant special effects, good cinematography, an interesting story (more so than ""Jumanji"") and mostly engaging characters, ""Zathura: A Space Adventure"" is a film worth watching.  The primary downside to the film is the almost constant fighting between Walter & Danny, as well as Walter's very poor attitude during most of the film; but this is better explained towards the end of the film.

2474668,4,B000DBHX4M,"A highly entertaining family film about the inadvertant adventure of two boys and their teenage sister, ""Zathura"" is a space game the bumbling brothers find one day while stationed at dad's house (the parents are divorced and dad gets parenting time in this flick.) After about 15 minutes setting the scene of the brothers intermittently fighting, cutting down each other, failing to get along, and being bored at dad's house, dad goes to the store, the younger borther finds the game and, wow, does the movie go into outer space.

The game requires each player to turn a knob which tells them where to move, after which their spaceship correspondingly advances on the board, and a card pops up with a message. Essentially, whatever comes up on a popup card in the game happens to the boys in real life. Right away, their dad's house is hoisted to the universe where they are variously attacked by spacecraft, hone in on and rescue a lost astronaut, try to survive a deranged robot, fail to be fried by passage too close to somebody's sun, and a half-dozen other calamaities. Oh yeah, their sister becomes cryonic during one of these gambits and spends time as a frozen statue. That astronaut turns out to be somebody pretty special, too.

Jon Favreau's direction, the outer space staging, and the set designs are all sumptuous in this highly-evolved film that is basically for kids...but my wife and I laughed throughout and stayed involved all the way to the end. There's a moral to this tale, of course, that is predictably homespun. Tim Robbins plays the dad in the opening and closing scenes; he must have been filming elsewhere when he made this flick.

One unanticipated devlopment from this game, er, movie -- the score reminded me so much of Gustav Holst's ""The Planets"" that I soon bought a newer version of that music. Don't know if that one's any good; I'll grade it here later. This movie is definitely a winner for anyone that is or once was a child and has (or had) an imagination.

The film goes along the lines of Jumanji - a game that pulls the players into it. The plot of the film is that two brothers begin playing, and find themselves in outer space, beseiged by all manners of spaceborne things from meteorites to alien lizards. There are several good messages that the film gets across, like 'try to get along with your brothers and sisters'. These ideas aren't really pushed in your face, but they're pretty obvious, nonetheless. This is one of the things I liked about it. I enjoy films that are geared toward kids that contain positive messages - they get too few of them these days.

The special effects were great, the acting was very good for a movie filled with child actors, and the action sequences were okay for even younger kids to watch.

The only way to finish the game - which catapults their house into deep space - is to reach Zathura and finish the game.  Along the way, Danny and his unloving brother Walter will bury their differences as they face off against a homicidal robot, meteor showers and hordes of carnivorous reptilian Zorgons.  (""They eat meat.  We're meat!!"" Danny yelps.)

My first thought when catching the trailer for this flick was that the guys who made ""Jumanji"" should sue - until I found out that both ""Zathura"" were based on books (surprising enough) written by the same guy.  (Two similar movies based on books written by the same guy, but not one adaptation of ""House with a clock in its Walls""?  What black hole has Planet Hollywood fallen into?)  While the older movie had a broader plot and more characters, I appreciated the slim offerings of ""Zathura"" even more.  The action kept me holding on, the treacly emotional scenes are happily few and there are some genuine surprises.  It's a fun movie, diverting in that unassuming way that Hollywood sometimes is.

FOR KIDS? ""Zathura"" is one of those movies that makes you wonder whether it should be seen by anybody old enough to have been in the movie.  I'm not sure how parents should decide - I would let me kids watch it, just not alone.  On the one hand, the violence is minimal - on the other hand, the threat of violence is everywhere, and the gap between the two gets pretty close.  (The killer robot never actually kills anybody, but its intentions are pretty clear, and they involve buzzsaws and grasping claws.)

2474676,3,B000DBHX4M,"Zathura is pretty good and it's a movie that will definitely keep most kids entertained thanks to the wacky characters and special effects. Its back-story is exactly like Van Allsburg's first book turned film Jumanji but the acting isn't as solid. So now you know it's just like Jumanji, so you know that two kids basically start to play a game and somehow someway they're thrown into the game and everything that the game says will happen actually happens. As a person who already saw Jumanji and I'm sure everyone in the world has too seeing as Jumanji's videotape stays in every classroom I've ever been in, I should only have to explain the quality of Zathura. These kids are a little too old for their own good, and they push the PG rating as far they can. Older brother Walter has one dirty mouth so if your child still has virgin ears you may want to watch out for that.

Though this story is much like Jumanji Van Allsburg still does a nice job of delivering a different set of characters and ending with a moral that will have siblings hugging each other. The ending is very predictable but if a kid is watching he/she probably won't even notice because the explosive action and fat aliens will catch most of their attention. If you are watching a movie like this with your children you can always stretch a little fib at the end and say ""see this will happen if you keep being mean to your brother"". Zathura is not really trying to come across as a children's classic or an original work but it is a nice family movie though that PG rating is used to the fullest. Walter is funny when he says it but it's not really needed. I would suggest watching Zathura on Starz first since it's being played on there now, it will save you money.",1161043200,7,1743,4.413043478260869

2474679,4,B000DBHX4M,"Zathura isn't a direct sequel to Jumanji, although there seems to be a mystical connection between the two board games. We do know  Chris Van Allsburg wrote both the picture books, and the premise of both films are similar. But while Jumanji was also kid-friendly, Robin Williams still took something away from the kids' performances. Here, not being saddled with a star actor - who hogs all the screen time -  the focus in Zathura is squarely on the two child stars who play the contentious siblings, and the film is generous with its portrayal of their rivalrous relationship, as well as their fantastic, out of this world adventures.

Walter and Danny are two young, neglected brothers (10 & 6 years old respectively) who are going thru that normal stage of sibling rivalry. They have an older sister Lisa (Kristen Stewart) who sleeps all day and who doesn't take her babysitting duties seriously, and a divorced father (Tim Robbins) who one week-end afternoon leaves them alone in their ""creepy, old house"" to go to work. In the midst of their usual shenanigans, Danny ends up in the scary basement and chances upon an old board game called Zathura. When Walter refuses to join him in play, Danny winds the key on the board and begins playing anyway - and, the next second, the children are frantically taking ""evasive action"" against an in-house meteor shower. And that's only the beginning!

Suddenly, their house is floating in space, their sister is in a cryonic sleep, and a maniacal robot, an astronaut, and ravenous reptilian space aliens become unexpected visitors. The only way to get home seems to be to keep playing the game, but with every turn, the danger deepens, as well as the boys' mutual dislike. Will Walter and Danny ever get home? Will the spaceman ever get home? Will their sister ever wake up?

Zathura has a total ensemble of 5 actors, and you really don't need any more to make the film work. Josh Hutcherson (Walter) and Jonah Bobo (Danny) are the two main protagonists and they prove to be capable young actors. They are ably bolstered by veteran actor Tim Robbins and also by Dax Shepard, who has a nice turn as the stranded astronaut. Kristen Stewart, meanwhile, does a great job as the frozen popsickle.

With an interesting, magical premise, flawless special effects (that robot was a trip), skillful direction by Jon Favreau, and a nice albeit predictable twist near the end, an adult can certainly find something to like here (I certainly did). But this film is firmly targeted for our young audience. And, as such, Zathura is quickly paced, highly energetic and wholesome enough (there are some mild profanity uttered by the kids). Younger children under 5 or 6 years old might find the movie experience too intense, but older kids should get a kick out of the outrageous and sometimes intense perils, the amazing set designs, and the cool robot and aliens. And there's even a cliched life lesson thrown in which might sneak up on the youngsters. So, by all means, pop Zathura in your player and give the kids - and the kid in you - a treat.",1156032000,,3079,4.735074626865671
2474680,2,B000DBHX4M,"I suppose if I were six this might be a good film.  The special effects are quite good and the art design is outstanding, but as an adult I require a bit of a story to go with my smoke and mirrors.  The film does a large number of things right.  The look is absolutely spectacular from beginning to end and I loved the way that the art design reminded one of the forties to fit the design of the game.  Unfortunately, the plot was pretty much nonexistent.  If one has seen the quite excellent JUMANJI, one knows what to expect.  But this one lacks the originality of that film as well as the large cast and varied sets.  This film is restricted to a house in outer space, precluding both varieties in locations and in cast.

Despite the above-mentioned restrictions, this might still have been a good movie if only the script had been stronger.  There just wasn't much to it, and the entire brother versus brother aspect got intensely tiresome well before the utterly predictable bonding that inevitably took place before the end of the film.  Indeed, the screaming matches between the two brothers caused me more than once to nearly turn the film off before I had completed it, something that almost never happens (I can almost count all the films I have started but not finished on the fingers of both hands).

Would I recommend a parent showing this to a younger child?  I think it might be a bit jarring for a child under six.  It would probably an average child over eleven.  It might be OK for those in between, but I can't imagine many adults enjoying this one.",1155340800,3,1568,4.456140350877193
2474681,3,B000DBHX4M,"Those who criticize ""Zathura"" for being a copycat ""Jumanji"" are apparently clueless about the Van Allsburg's books. ""Zathura"" is a sequel to ""Jumanji"", it is about what happened when the Budwing brothers opened the game box that Peter and Judy discarded at the end of ""Jumanji"". Early board games were often designed with two-sided boards so that the game pieces could be used to play two different games-usually of the same type. ""Zathura"" was the flip side of the ""Jumanji"" game board and the ones the brothers choose to play (because Walter did not like jungle games). So it is supposed to be another ""Jumanji"".

Having grown up with this same sibling age dynamic (six and ten) I was not surprised at the amount of yelling, anger, and resentment that goes on between the two brothers. I was however surprised that anyone would find this sort of thing entertaining. While their divorced father (Tim Robbins playing the only sympathetic character in the film) is away at a meeting, the younger brother (Danny) finds an old Zathura game in the basement. Based on those old 1950's tin toys it involves two tin spaceships on a track racing around space. Each spin of the dial determines the distance the ship will move on that turn and a card is ejected detailing what happens to the ship at that point of space.

As Danny and Walter face the challenges of space they discover that they can work as a team and they even develop some affection for each other (a more unrealistic idea than anything they actually encounter in space).

Like the source book, the movie adaptation of ""Zathura"" targets kindergarten to Grade 5 children. Like ""Sharkboy and Lavagirl"", older viewers will find very little of interest other than a fun production design and nice effects.

Unfortunately ""Zathura"" it is not as pure as that film which uniquely refused to compromise its ""for kids only"" story. ""Zathura"" does compromise, as the producers attempt to expand their audience by creating an older sister (Lisa played by Kristen Stewart) who was not a character in the book. While Stewart is fine in this role and even provides some comic relief, it is rather disturbing that the producers chose to turn her into a pubescent sex object, blustering around the house in her underwear for most of the film. Van Allsburg's illustrations are the best part of his books but this image is not one than he has ever published.

The DVD has some excellent special features, which even older viewers will enjoy.  The best is an interview with Van Allsburg in which he discusses his influences and his other books.

I was particularly annoyed by the packaging of the DVD. It prominently shows Kristen Stewart who plays their teenage sister. Admittedly, she is a very attractive young woman but she is only in a few scenes. I guess exploiting her image to make her seem like the star of this movie is to get a few teens to buy it. Maybe a few lecherous middle age men as well to purchase this family film. Who knows?",1154476800,,734,4.212765957446808

One thing is childish characters - but these were really really mean kids, and I think a bit too much on the mean side. One of the child-protagonists was portrayed as a cute and cunning little kid, but a dengerous pathological liar non the less. If there are kids like that out there, there should not be any movies with characters like it for our children to watch. So much more could have been done! To the director's credit, the old-school special effects are really cool, but they cannot replace underdeveloped story, mean characters. In conclusion, if you want to see a great family movie with your kids, great special effects, and a worthy story line with the point that will make your kids grow up into better people, watch ""Jumanji"" again and do not waste the time with this underachiever.

Unfortunately, the story line is thin, verging on nonsensical.  The kids are exposed to various perils AND GIVEN NO WAY TO COMBAT THEM. Occasionally, they are given a ""way out"" but fail to take it.

The kids' acting is adequate, but no more. The teenage sister seems to be in the movie only to look cute. And the ""message"" -- brothers should stick together -- is pretty simpleminded.  Still, ""Zathura"" is reasonably entertaining.

If you have children, I'd wait until they're at least eight before letting them watch this film due to the fact that the two kiddie leads have some pretty rough mouths and there are a few sequences that can get pretty scary for young'uns.

The reason that this seems familiar is that it's written by the same guy who wrote ""Jumanji.""  I liked this story much better when it was ""Jumanji.""  It's as if writer Chris Van Allsburg decided that ""Hey, it worked with jungle creatures, why not outerspace?""  This film is almost an exact carbon copy of ""Jumanji,"" all the way down to a regretful former player of the game trapped within it.  The only thing missing is the huge patrol car-eating vines.

So, with that said, I'm sure any child between the ages of eight and twelve will love this film.  However, if you want to give them a real treat, let them watch ""Jumanji"" first and then have them compare the two.  I think you'll find that most kids will prefer the original over its lesser follow-up.",1147478400,10,1240,4.515695067264574
2474690,2,B000DBHX4M,"I love a good kids film. Often I like them better than films aimed exclusively at adults. There is less objectionable material. Plots are not convoluted. Often there is genuine sentiment, and a moral to the story. What I do not enjoy is the increasing tendency of movies for kids to rely on kinetic energy (or wild special effects) as a substitute for good writing and acting. I think that is part of what happened with Zathura.

Zathura is a movie like Jumanji -- where kids start playing a board game (called Zathura, naturally) and they enter an alternate reality -- the world of the game made real. They have to finish the game to get back to the normal world.

The acting isn't very good. Haley Joel Osment and Dakota Fanning have raised the bar so high now that what used to be a passable job of acting for a child now looks silly and amateurish. I got bored about halfway through and started fast forwarding furiously to the end.

Zathura is supposed to have a ""moral,"" but that aspect is so ham-handedly written and acted that it almost seems pasted on.

The game involves a series of challenges and threats, as the children journey to outer space and confront robots and lizard aliens and friendly stranded astronouts. It is mostly a succession of strange things (involving expensive special effects photography) happening every time a kid takes a turn at the game. The kids then react badly (or badly act) in fright and stumble their way through until the game ends.

I don't know why this movie was made. The only thing it has going for it is a lot of action whenever the game play results in peril. In between the peril, the dialogue is dull.

There are so many great kids movies, or even mediocre kid's movies, better than this -- almost any of the animated classics directed by Hayao Miyazaki, or Secondhand Lions. I kind of enjoyed Holes, and The Sandlot, too. The old My Bodyguard. The Incredibles was very entertaining.

I don't know how the kiddies reacted to Zathura, but it seems like a waste of time to me. You may find yourself wishing the kids did get pulled into the black hole, just to end the movie early.",1146787200,8,2131,4.533854166666667

The film is ok for the older audience but they will lose intere becouse the film drags on and on and on. The special effects are good and the acting is ok.

2474694,4,B000DBHX4M,"""Zathura"" is a very cute, well-made adventure movie that is, for the most part, kid friendly and entertaining for adults, too. The special effects are fantastic, and a plot twist or two make the movie more cerebrally stimulating than your average pre-teen adventure flick.

Parents, be forewarned, though -- the main characters (two brothers, ages 10 and 6) spout a few mildly bad words and phrases that struck me as being ripe for parroting.  ""Sucks,"" for example.  The one ""bad"" line that stands out most to me is ""Get me a juicebox, beeatch!""  In context (shouted at a robot), it's funny and memorable, so I know that if I were a pre-teen boy, I'd repeat it ad naseum.  Probably at my sister.

""Sucks"" and ""Beeatch"" notwithstanding, ""Zathura"" has an unmistakeably positive ""family"" message (i.e. brothers and sisters should love, respect, and protect one another).  Your kids will enjoy it, and so will you.",1142985600,3,910,4.908496732026144
2474695,2,B000DBHX4M,"If you read the actual Zathura book, you quickly realize that it's probably Allsburg's weakest. Although the movie enhanced and expanded the story quite a bit, I was left disappointed. I turned to my wife a handful of times in the theater just wishing that the kids would stop shouting at each other and get on with the story. For crying out loud, I can come home from work at the wrong moment if I want to listen to kids yelling at each other. Yeah, they used some awful words too; but they were unlikeable characters for the most part because of their endless banter.

The movie had an endless potential for good adventure: an entire universe. Yet, the story revolves around their little house the entire time, and the perils repeat themselves rather than introducing something unique.

Don't see it thinking that it in some way relates to Jumanji, like it did in the book either. They don't resemble each other at all. Miss this movie.",1142985600,3,938,4.610778443113772

However, this movie is cooler.  Naturally, a lot of it is computer enhanced, and you know how it is going to end, but as someone famous once said, it's the journey that matters.

The small quibbles that I have are thus:

1) The kids just aren't nice to one another during the movie's majority.  Naturally, they learn in the end how to love each other, but I spent a lot of time explaining to our four year old that it just wasn't nice to talk that way.

2) It is pretty scary in parts.  I wasn't scared, of course, in case you are wondering.  No, our daughter asked us to turn it off during the robot scene. We'll try again when she is a little older.  My wife and I were so into the movie that we turned it on again after our daughter went to bed.

So, all in all I'd say five stars.  It's the best movie in its genre, I can easily say (if you can name more than two movies in this genre, I salute you!).",1142899200,2,1160,4.1524663677130045

2474698,2,B000DBHX4M,"It's a decent movie for kids, but not for adults.  I found it to be too geared towards children unlike Jumanji which was geared towards all ages.  Also, was I the only one who noticed that in the beginning when the sister was frozen the dice said they must go five times before she could be ""unfrozen""?  They must have went about 8-10 times before she was unfrozen.  There were too many mistakes like that one in it.",1142812800,,416,4.294871794871795

When the grandchildren (a sophisticated 6-year-old debutante, her hyperactive 5-year-old brother, and the perpetually teething 10-month-old) yelled for a movie last night, I plunked it in the DVD player and told them ""This is too scarey for little kids.  You're not allowed to watch it.""

The next hundred minutes was spent with the first-grader peeping over my shoulder (while hiding under a blanket), the pre-schooler alternately bobbing up in front and ducking down behind the arm of the sofa, and the baby gazing at the screen in wonder, the whole crew as much involved in the snarling and sniping of the brothers as in the hissing, clanking menace of the Zorgons.

Today I'm finding sketches of defective robots all over the living room, and the older kids are conspiring to lock their 14-year-old cousin in the bathroom to see whether or not she can be put into cryonic sleep for five turns.

This one is definitely a keeper.

It is clearly done on a lower budget, but the director shows that the marriage of practical FX and CGI works superbly. For a film that revolves very much around an essentially  single set, with additions, this is fun. You can get to see  how Stan Winston Studios did such a great job. And the extras, including the commentary all exude enthusiasm for the film craft.

Do not expect a JUMANJI clone, but DO expect all of the craft that the Van Allsburg imagination has created. There is an interview with Allsburg that just shows beautifully how he has created so many different worlds.

The constant bickering between the brothers was annoying, but that was the point. The special effects were fun. The plot was original. The monsters were somewhat scary. The dialogue between the brothers rang true. The older sister's part was small, but that she was not that involved. There was no lack of air in space, but it was an universe within the confines of the game. The logic within the movie was somewhat consistent and that is all I ask of a movie.  My wife even liked the movie and she hates SciFi. I liked Zumanji and this movie was better done almost on every level.

There is no message to the movie, except that older brothers should act like older brothers and take responsibility for their siblings. Actually, in this day and age that is a good message.",1140912000,,905,4.512195121951219

This is just plain good fun; Jon Favreau has done an excellent job of translating the book to the big screen.

For those of you concerned about the language and your own kids....unless you keep them locked up in a closet everyday from the outside world then chances are that the use of the word ""biyatch"" is one of the least insulting things that your child has heard to date.

On its own merits, however, it's an entertaining if noisy little film.  The brothers, wisecracking insensitive Walter (Josh Hutcherson) and whiny, nerdish Danny (Jonah Bobo), aren't instantly likeable as all they do is fuss and feud and act like little hellions.  Father (Tim Robbins) and mama are divorced and that excuse of a broken home souring the kids is used again.  (Coming from a broken home myself, I find it insulting to think that divorce is blamed once again; the father has actually spoiled the brats).  They also have the obligatory insolent older sister (Kristen Stewart).  One day little Danny finds a board game called Zathura and before you know it, the siblings find themselves off into space, house and all.  They play the game with varying perils and they hook up with a stranded astronaut (an effective Dax Stewart) who aids them in a fight against reptilian aliens called Zorgons.  The movie tries a little surprise but seasoned viewers will have seen it coming.  The effects are pretty good, the movie having a cartoonish atmosphere at times and kids should enjoy the dangerous events.

The style and quality of the production was excellent for the intended purpose. Jonah and Josh's performances as the two brothers was perfect. And I hate to break it to some of you parents but regarding the ""language issue"" - when you're not around, your little darlings imitate you and any other adult they've met, good and bad. It was this aspect of the script that made the story better than the safe sanitized media some would force on us.

The DVD extras are better than most. Here's a kid actor film that actually acknowledges the participation of the young actors. The Effects extras don't just show how something was created but how it was incorporated on the set to help bring the Director's vision to life. Commentary by Jon Favreau and Peter Billingsley is also very good and informative.

The movie does so well for you to watch at home especially if you have a surround sound system.  The meteor shower in 5.1 surround sounds awesome.

Another suprising element to the movie is the relationship between the two characters, two brothers.  They have the typical older younger brother relationship, they can't stand each other.  But through the movie we see them beginning to work together and resolve some of their conflict.  For families with children that fuss and fight, this is also a good movie for them to watch and discuss sybling relationships.

2474712,4,B000DBHX4M,"For those who have seen ""Zathura"" I'd suggest skipping to the third paragraph.

Hollywood is about recycling. If the idea worked once do it again and again and again ad nauseum until you kill the charm of the film that inspired the craze. ""Zathura"" appeared to be a fun adventure fantasy on the surface but boy did it look like it lived up to the recycling trend. Luckily I was wrong. While the basic inspiration is the same (a board game that comes to life)director Jon Favreau and his writers David Koepp & John Kamps revisit the basic concept and then do their own fun spin on it. Based on another book by Chris Van Allsburg (""Jumanji"", ""The Polar Express"")and adeptly directed by Favreau ""Zathura"" is a fun adventure that's just familair enough to entice kids to want to watch it with enough surprises to keep both parents and kids entertained.

Walter (Josh Hutcherson from Kicking and Screaming), Danny (Jonah Bobo) and Lisa (Kristen Stewart from Panic Room)are typical siblings. They torture each other as much as their parents can stand it. Their Dad (Tim Robbins in a nice cameo) is recently divorced and everyone is trying to cope with a family ripped apart. Danny finds the board game Zathura in the basement of their new home. This ancient board game looks like it was made in the 50's (as does everything they run into from the game). Once they start playing it they get sucked into the Zathura universe. They run into insane robots and giant lizards that like to eat human flesh (don't worry we don't see any of that). The only way home is to finish the game.

The film is a lot of fun. My three kids loved it (ages 7 to 12). There are some minor bad words in the movie which got overlooked the first time in theaters (hence the PG rating) The performances are first rate and kids will be able to relate to the conflicts between the three siblings. There's also a a number of nice plot twists. Like Favreau's last film ""Elf"" he gives ""Zathura"" heart and humor in equal doses.

The DVD itself looks first rate with a high definition transfer from Sony. There's lots of extras for this set which film fans will enjoy that go behind-the-scenes into the design of the movie, visual effects and a sectionon the world of illustrator/author Chris Van Allsburg. The producer and director do a commentary track that's really informative to listen to unlike a lot of these tracks.

""Zathura"" does recycle the basic premise from ""Jumanji"" (hey, there's only 36 dramatic situations in the world and the Greeks thought of them all so it is all, in a sense, recycling)but more importantly it's what you do with the material that matters.
