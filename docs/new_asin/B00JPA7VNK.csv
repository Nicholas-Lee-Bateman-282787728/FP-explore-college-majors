6382599,5,B00JPA7VNK,"The ""Monster High: Clawesome Double Feature""DVD is great because it combines two Monster High movies in one set.  Yes they are movies that have previously aired on television but it makes it easy that they are together.  It features over an hour total of Monster High fun.  The characters make us laugh and while it may seem like a scary show, its not.  More silly as its showing the ""monsters"" as teenagers.  Even monsters have to go to high school. The show does have good lessons though for kids that are easy enough to understand such as acceptance and working together.",1407024000,2,574,4.643564356435643

There were characters that they did not know what their story was and this goes a great deal on explaining them for those who might be in the same position. It's not like it is a master piece, but it does a good job on keeping the kids entertained on those lazy afternoons when it's raining buckets and you are running out of ideas on how to entertain them.

Note: The box art is misleading because ""Fright On!"" was the last of the 2D TV specials.

The gem of the collection is arguably ""Fright On!"", the second TV special.  It turns out that Monster High is unique even in the Monster World because most monsters attend single monster type schools in order to reduce the drama... and the carnage, but the success of Monster High has encouraged the powers that be to close down a couple of single monster type high schools (one for vampires and one for werewolves) and integrate them into Monster High.  After Headless Headmistress Bloodgood joyfully announces this plan, clearly something she has been advocating for years, she asks the fearleading squad to form a welcoming committee in order to smooth the path for the newcomers' integration.  Reaction varies.  Frankie responds with boundless enthusiasm and undaunted optimism while Cleo concentrates on convincing the newcomers to accept her ""rule"".  Clawdia and Draculaura respond less enthusiastically; they know the history of their peoples' record of getting along too well to believe this is going to work though they sincerely wish it would.  It begins badly of course, but to everyone's surprise except Frankie's, it actually starts to work, given the able assistance of Abbey's bluntness and low tolerance for teenage drama.  Suddenly and without warning, however, all their progress begins to rapidly reverse itself, and the vampires and werewolves begin to work themselves up for an all out rumble to decide who will control Monster High... or what's left of it.  Now it is up to our heroines to discover just what in the world happened and then how to survive long enough to defeat the murderous villains and patch things up before visiting officials come to check on their progress.  Gently Pushed Moral: Well it isn't that racism is bad although of course it is.  Rather, it is that there actually are people out there willing to deliberately stir up racism and anger over same where it is dying out or no longer exists because it serves their twisted purposes, and their influence must be watched for and guarded against.  This might be the most important lesson Monster High has ever taught because so few others are teaching it these days.

Minor Nit: The villains' motive when finally revealed makes perfect sense for one of them, in a sick and twisted if coldly calculated way, but NOT for the other one whose decision to participate remains a mystery.

Almost as enjoyable is ""Escape from Skull Shores"", the 4th TV special, the MH version of King Kong.  A Spring Break sea voyage by several of the ghouls to the Great Barrier Reef (so that Gil can finally meet Lagoona's parents) ends in shipwreck after they encounter a Kraken.  But fortunately (?) their enormous raft made from all the suitcases of clothes the ghouls had packed for such a short trip is spotted by a somewhat sinisterly behaving normie, and they are rescued after he takes a long look at them through his spyglass.  He offers to take them on to the Great Barrier Reef after a slight detour to the titular island where things quickly get stranger and stranger.  Gently Pushed Moral: We are all monsters to somebody but mostly to ourselves so best not to stress out about it.

Minor Nit: A very important character to the plot is seen only in the past: in memories and on B&W film, but that character's fate is never revealed.  In light of what happens later this is a significant oversight.  What's more I think the anti-exploitation of the odd looking message is a bit overdone.  Yes, no one should be forced or have his or her youth or mental incompetence taken advantage of, but what of the adult of sound mind who would choose to exploit people's desire to stare at his or her odd looks in order to earn a better living through less backbreaking labor than otherwise possible?  Do we really have the right to pick his or her pocket just so that we can enjoy feelings of smug self-righteousness?

I think not.

6382613,3,B00JPA7VNK,I left a pkg review!  Packaging was all crumpled up and the video was scratched in a few places and off it's center point in the box.  I do not believe the paging it was in was sufficient for a DVD. It must have got tossed around a lot!  Granddaughter very unhappy that it was scratched.
