8378070,5,B002QXI2LI,A non traditional staging that remains faithful to the music and the myth. Very powerful!,1487980800,,89,5.0
8378071,2,B002QXI2LI,"This production is a heavily reworked version of the opera.  If you are going to own six or more DVDs of this opera, perhaps buy this one too.  But for someone wanting 1-5 productions, stay away.

Go with Leppard/Glyndebourne first:  It includes more of the ballet music than any other DVD productions available as of 2015, about 35 more minutes of exquisite music.

Then buy the Gardiner performance.  It is superior in all respects, but does lacks about 35 minutes of ballet music.

Note that the Gardiner performance at Covent Garden in 2015 (in 1774 French version) included all the ballet music and lasted about 2 hours and 10 minutes, about 30 minutes more than the Gardiner DVD version (based on Berlioz 1859 reworking of the opera).",1444953600,2,740,4.7795275590551185
8378072,5,B002QXI2LI,I usually don't like classic operas with modernized production and costumes. This one is an exception. The modernized twist is made to fit the story very well and makes watching this opera very enjoyable. Alagna as Orphee does a great job and and is more realistic than a female singer in the role. His impeccable french is an added bonus for french speakers like me. This is the version of this opera that you would want to watch without getting bored,1441324800,4,452,4.592592592592593
8378073,4,B002QXI2LI,"This is definitely a reinterpretation of the opera.
Orpheus should be cast as a man - no doubt!  A woman singing the role of a man is not good - though traditional.  And a counter-tenor is worse.  The soprano duets sound so much better as a man, tenor and soprano.

It is great to hear this aria sung by a man, and in French - ' J'ai perdu mon Eurydice'.  When a man sings this aria it is usually in Italian, 'Che faro senza Euridice'.  Pavarotti sang this aria and more recently, Roberto Alagna sang it in French.  It is a very beautiful aria from one of the most beautiful operas ever written.  I am more accustomed to hearing a woman sing it and that is great.  But, Orpheus is a male role and really should be played by a man and not a woman or countertenor.
busy I would rather listen to it
The ending was very different.  Without subtitles it was difficult to understand.  Eurydice dies at the end and Orh]phee dies also after calling her name,  She is not brought back to life by 'Love' and the three do not sing a trio.",1386547200,2,1027,4.183673469387755
8378074,5,B002QXI2LI,"Although the storyline varied from my recollection of this Greek story, I found it wonderful to watch. Alagna did a wonderful performance. I had to view it twice to notice all the details of the story. Like a good book, movie, repeated viewings/readings bring out the subtle details.",1364601600,6,283,4.916666666666667
8378075,4,B002QXI2LI,"I bought this DVD (no blu-ray available when I ordered) because I wanted to hear Alagna.  Obviously, his French is perfect, and that is also true of Marc Barrard.  Serena Gamberoni, on the other hand, has a marked foreign accent but you can still understand every word without subtitles.  What I did not like is the way she is made to behave.  The first reviewer (February 2010) writes that she ""attempts to seduce the guide""; that is putting it mildly.  She nearly cuckolds her husband on the front seat of the car (yes, the front seat! the Alagna brothers don't know much about American culture).  The poor husband, of course, is following orders and looks the other way.

I did not like the updated staging very much either; but, then, I am prejudiced against updating.  Be warned, however, that Orphe et Eurydice is poles apart from Orphe aux Enfers.  Gluck's masterpiece is gloom and laments from Act I to Act III.  Even the wedding in David Alagna's Prologue is marred by Eurydice's fainting spell.  Suitable when you feel gloomy and want to enjoy your distress.  For comic relief, get the other Orphe (Offenbach's Orphe aux Enfers, with Marc Minkowski and Les Musiciens du Louvre); for a case of ""terminal"" gloom, get all of Offenbach's DVDs you can afford.

On the other hand, if you prefer Gluck and do not go for updated stagings, get the whole opera on CDs.  Naxos just issued a new set (1774 Paris version), with an all-French cast (about the same price as the Alagnas' DVD).",1351641600,3,1487,4.6692307692307695
8378076,5,B002QXI2LI,"Mr. David Dillinger has very appropriately described what to expect from this dvd, so I thought I would add my own feelings to help other opera lovers decide whether they would like to have it.

I confess I seldom listen to baroque operas, and thus had not seen, nor heard a single note, of Gluck's Orphee in French nor of his original Italian version. I am also generally wary of modernised productions of operas, as  many of them are so remote from the composer's intentions and from the essence of the story to the point of the absurd. Nevertheless, I purchased this dvd and I am very pleased that I did. I was completely enthralled with Gluck's music and this production (directed by Roberto Alagna's brother, David). Perhaps this is because I will much rather see and listen to a male role sung by a true lyric tenor rather than a female singer, countertenor, or castrato. I realize am offending  all the purists and lovers of baroque opera, but I believe the singing and acting in this production genuinely transmit the true feelings and passion of Orphee and Eurydice and makes the story believable in its modern terms. Most of the opera evolves in lighting with shades of gray, which is very appropriate, dramatically, to the music and the plot.

The star of this production is Roberto Alagna. His french diction is a treat to listen to, and although, as Mr. Dillinger remarked,  his voice may no longer be the same as when he recorded Gounod's Romeo et Juliette, he is in top form and  maintains his very pleasant timbre. He sings all the notes impeccably (while I must assume Gluck's  original writing must have been transposed down to fit a lyric tenor's range). He is also a very good actor, and  manages to sing beautifully even when being carried around in the air or being dragged on the floor on his back by the dead inhabitants of Hades. Serena Gamberoni has a very pleasant voice, sings well, is quite attractive, and her expressions and body language convey her emotions perfectly while she cannot understand Orphee's unwillingness to look at her when she comes back to life.

The video Blu-ray image and 5.1 dts sound are outstanding.

Overall, having watched and thoroughly enjoyed this modern and  unique version of Orphee, I am now incentivated to seek a more traditional version.",1289174400,11,2303,4.7325
8378077,3,B002QXI2LI,"The original Orfeo premiered in Vienna; the role was sung by an alto castrato; Gluck shorly altered the title role for a male soprano. When he adapted it for the French he made many wholesale changes. Orphee became a ""high"" tenor, the ending changed and much new music was written for it principally for the ballet. In the 19th century Berlioz adapted a version for Viardot; he was assisted in this endeavor with Saint-Saens. In the days of LP/CD there were three recordings of the French edition. One emanted from Russia and two from France, one with Gedda and one with Simoneau. These recordings excluded the bravura aria that concludes Act I. The many other LP/CD versions--in Italian share one trait in common with the three French versions: all are different in different ways.

All of this is prelude to the version under consideration. Its one true virtue for me is that it is sung in French and two of the singers are truly at home in that language. Other than that one is tempted to describe this DVD as a ""fantasia"" on Orphee et Eurydice. The Overture is now described as a Prologue. It has been expanded and includes some of the ballet music. The setting is contemporary and we are at the wedding of the lead characters. Post wedding there is an automobile accident and the heroine is killed. There is one major change in the cast of characters. Amor is now called Le Guide and sung by a baritone. Much of the music proceeds as written but the director has added some bizarre bits of business, one of which I am tempted to describe as purient--probably too strong a word. When Orphee will not look as Eurydice she turns to Le Guide and appears to attempt to seduce him (!); this is too much for Orphee and breaks his promise and embraces Eurydice at which point she dies. David Alagna the director brother of the tenor reverts at this point to the original and Orphee opts for death.

I am not a musicologist and have not researched the reason why Gluck altered the ending for the French and although it is the French version I prefer the ending is not (to me) a satisfactory one. But Gluck wrote so much wonderful music for this version it has always been my preference. Over the years others have felt that even though they were staging Orfeo, they were not reluctant to cut and paste and create something that Gluck never contemplated, a conflation of at least two versions. To the purist this is heresy. For me the major question is does it work and if so wny not include music written for the the French edition.

Interestingly enough the only other French edition available on DVD is the one from Opera Australia. The hero is sung by David Hobson; he is the only tenor to attempt the bravura aria and one almost wishes that he hadn't. His is a somewhat monochromatic voice with a slight flicker and enough flexibility but he really doesn't have the high notes and indeed his grasp of the text leaves a lot to be desired, notably J'as perdu. In my review of that set I applauded the company for attempting to stage the French edition (even though updated to what I haven't the slightest idea) since it is rarely done. Mezzos are more abundant than French tenors (or tenors who have a high extention);at least this version can give you an idea of what Gluck was attempting to do. Alas the Bologna version is David Alagna's take on a baroque opera; this sin (if it be such) is utterly unique and really can't even be compared to the  French edition. It exists as a one off, nothing more.

The singing? Alagna's voice is no longer the lovely sweet tenor we heard and saw in Romeo et Juliette. He avoids singing softly and hence much of what he does is not nuanced or musical. His virtue, of course, is that the text is by nature his and for this reason I am glad to have this DVD. Gluck is exremely difficult to sing. The parameters of this music demand that the structure of the music be obeyed but must be passionate. Callas instinctively knew this and her recording of the great lament is Gluck singing of the highest order even though her voice coming apart at the seams. Hobson's somewhat anemic tenor doesn't even begin to suggest the emotions of Orphee. Alagna does bring a great deal of passion to the aria and for the most part it is exciting, but I wonder if his excursions into heavier roles have taken a toll. Le Guide is sung by Marc Barrard; I assume he, too, is French and he sings well enough although all kinds of adjustments surely have been made for this low voice to sing Amor's music. Serena Gameroni, Eurydice, now has the smallest role. She too sings well, and has the advantage of being quite beautiful.  Her French isn't bad but it does suffer when compared to her partner.

Can this be recommended? For lovers of the French edition, I hope I have provided enough caveats for you to make up your mind. This is an edition that must supplement since it is too far from what Gluck wrote. We are not likely to see another Orphee in the near or distant future. In the days of LP/CD the cataloque was rife with Italian editions, most notably Verrett and Horne and Baker. Unfortunately, there is nothing comparable in the DVD catalogue.",1265328000,24,5167,4.502132196162047
