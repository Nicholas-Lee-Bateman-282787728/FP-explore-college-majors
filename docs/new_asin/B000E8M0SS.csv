2509486,5,B000E8M0SS,"Walked into the living room as my wife was watching and got suckered into the plot even though I thought I had enough of this kind of drama that seems so prevalent, but I loved the acting and story which is not a syrupy sweet fuzzy warm story at all thank goodness that I had to get this for our library.

I do have a question as too the diff between IMDB running time of 99 Minutes and the 85 actual minutes. Imdb error???",1199836800,7,423,4.035714285714286
2509487,5,B000E8M0SS,"This one is a keeper. It's an excellent movie, with a good story, without the language. A tear-jerker. It's one that I will watch time and again.",1189382400,18,145,4.407407407407407
2509488,4,B000E8M0SS,"This is an extraordinary movie.  It deals with realistic situations and realistic people without being oppressive.  When people stop associating with other people who are wrong for them and manage to fall in with the sort of people who are right for them, their lives improve dramatically, as happens in this movie.

Other reviewers have picked up on how the judge helped this teenage girl, but they didn't see how the girl helped the grown woman also.  By being brazen enough, and smart enough to ask some searching questions, she helped.  Also, the parallel in situations between the girl and the grown woman with regard to their respective fathers made for a rich story.

This movie should also be commended for having been brave enough to deal with a bright kid, and for understanding how bright kids are different and how even their emotional problems are different.

Quibbles: the transition for the girl was a bit too fast.  It was not unrealistic, but it needed more development.  This of course would have slowed down the pace of the movie, however, and most viewers would have liked it less.  The movie is only 80 minutes long.  It would have been better at the usual TV-movie length of 100 minutes.

Also, the father's reaction at the end was not credible to me.  Maybe he did feel guilty, but he was also feeling a lot of other things.  His avoidance reaction was just not credible.

In defense of the movie, however, against another commenter: there are ends left open at the movie's end.  One cannot assume the exact nature of those resolutions and condemn the movie for making these resolutions which it in fact leaves open.  Also, it is not at all unrealistic that the judge found the father: after all, she was looking through the records to do just that.

Bottom line: Don't miss this movie.  There aren't many this good that deal with human problems and decent human beings.",1189036800,55,1893,4.716463414634147

2509491,3,B000E8M0SS,"Good enough chick flick- very Daniel Steele and full of hope for people. The point is that there are a lot of foster kids out there that need good homes, however, this one was a little over the top with perfect Jaclyn being rich and oops finding the right bio daddy, falling in love and everyone is so happy without any baggage after living such lonely, unloved, damaged lives.",1170892800,13,377,4.478260869565218
2509492,3,B000E8M0SS,The movie was ok.  The end was poor I was expeting more.  Overall a good movie.,1168300800,7,79,3.875
2509521,5,B000E8M0SS,"Jaclyn Smith plays Kay Woodward, a judge who takes her job seriously. Lyndsy Fonseca plays a troubled 16 year-old foster child who appears in the judge's courtroom. The main storyline concerns finding a home for the 16 year-old, which the judge tries to do by discovering the girl's past. A secondary theme involves forgiveness, which is reflected not only in the girl's life, but in the judge's as well, and sometimes extremely subtly: a scene involving forgiveness plays out between the judge and her father, in the background, note the 16 year-old's attention. Forgiveness also had to have played a role in the judge's relationship with her ex-husband. Other subtle details which flesh out the script: A classroom scene discussing the play: Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?--which, it's worth noting, many feel is a play about those who would choose escapism instead of reality. The teen's favorite book is David Copperfield, a story about, essentially an orphan, a foster child. All actors do an excellent job, the setting is San Diego beautifully photographed and the script moves at a fast pace. It's not necessarily a pat ending, but one which points to a positive outcome.",1433289600,,1179,5.051282051282051
2509522,4,B000E8M0SS,"Ordinary Miracles is a TV movie on Hallmark Channel that features Jaclyn Smith,Lyndsy Fonseca and C. Thomas Howell together with Sarah Aldrich,Corbin Bernsen and Erik Eidem. The film was about a troubled teen that is scooped up by a tough San Diego judge whose conscience causes her to bring the girl home with her to live when together they face tons of insecurities and personal problems to forge a special bond in this tale of survival, love and family. It was directed by Michael Switzer.

Kay Woodbury is a tough, no-nonsense judge whose intractability in legal matters is intensified by a number of personal crises, including a bitter feud with her jurist father and her anguish over the recent remarriage of her ex-husband. Thus, Kay is no mood to play nice when teenager Sally Powell is brought before her. Harboring an intense hatred for the father who apparently abandoned her, Sally is a seemingly incorrigible delinquent who has already sent away from four foster homes. Figuring that she could no worse than anyone else, Kay takes Sally home on a trial basis. The girl proceeds to behave as atrociously as possible, but surprisingly Kay does not decide to write her off as a bad job, but instead concludes that what the girl needs is someone to trust and something to believe in. In this spirit, Kay locates Sally's birth father and upon being convinced that he was not motivated by selfishness when he dropped out of his daughter's life, secretly contrives for Sally and her dad to reconnect. In so doing, Kay finds her own way toward forgiveness, not only of those whom she feels have wronged her, but also of herself.

This TV movie is an entertaining character study between two people who learn from each other. In this case,it is a judge and a juvenile delinquent. It is a good drama and well-acted one especially with Jaclyn Smith playing Judge Kay Woodbury. Don't miss it on DVD whenever you get an opportunity to rent it.",1433203200,,1943,4.7626112759643915

2509525,5,B000E8M0SS,"Becoming a foster child is a sad thing. This paints it just the way it is. Being someone that was just approved by DHS to be a foster home, the movie made a big impact on my understanding of the journey.",1419465600,,203,3.975609756097561

2509545,4,B000E8M0SS,"I enjoy a Jaclyn Smith movie anytime.  Liked her in ""Charlie's Angels"" even better than Farah Fawcett in that series.  This movie shows compassion from a judge to help a young girl who has her life in front of her & bring a family back together.

2509566,5,B000E8M0SS,"""Ordinary Miracles"" was a great family film about how one person can make a difference in someone else's life by being courageous enough to go against popular opinion and to do what is right.  It also gives powerful insight as to why some people act rebellious;  it teaches that sometimes we need to learn to be able to see through the rough exterior and look into the heart. I recommend this film for young and old alike.  ""Ordinary Miracles""  also proves that a great film doesn't have to contain profanity to be good.",1228521600,7,520,4.559139784946237

2509568,4,B000E8M0SS,"This movie stars Jaclyn Smith, who plays a judge who has no life outside her work. She is dedicated to her work, like a robot, that doesn't have feelings, but soon a young girl who gets rejected by her foster parents because she won't behave, gets sent to a juvenile facility by this judge, Jaclyn Smith. When she realizes the girl may have to stay at this facility until a new family steps forward, the judge takes custody of the young teen. This girl has a boyfriend that takes her to the wrong side of the tracks, and only the judge seems to be able to change that. This movie is really good, and well acted. I won't spoil the rest, but watch this movie, it's worth your time. Jaclyn Smith did a wonderful job in this movie, and so did the young girl.",1219104000,33,754,4.243055555555555

2509570,5,B000E8M0SS,"If you are a fan of Jaclyn Smith, you'll love this movie.  She is a judge in a civil court setting in California.  A 16 year old girl is dumped on the court by the foster parents because they say she is unmanagable.  The judge takes the girl home temporarily until she can locate another foster family for this girl.
  Both the judge and the girl learn some tough lessons in the next few weeks.  Photography is great and Jaclyn Smith makes the story easier to watch.  I also like the fact that there is no profanity or indecent exposure.
  It's also a good film dealing with the importance of a dad to a growing girl.",1213142400,3,617,4.25
