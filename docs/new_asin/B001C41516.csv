8285762,4,B001C41516,This was a very nostalgic movie and reminded me of how simple life was back in the 50's. As much as I enjoyed it I thought it was expensive @ $50 Australian dollars.,1484697600,,165,4.03030303030303
8285763,5,B001C41516,Ulla Jacobsson and Folke Sundquist are beautiful young lovers in this moody and moving classic.,1406505600,,95,5.4
8285764,4,B001C41516,"A jewel onto itself.  Best performance by Ulla Jacobsson, who died young. Rustic, somewhat predictable, caused uproar in mid-fifties due to a skinny-dip scene, a little flesh showing.  Hits of Romeo-Juliet scenario. The dances are all memorable songs, mostly Swedish traditional.  We viewed it while engaged, and were charmed into pledging to name our first daughter as the main character, Kerstin (pronounced Shjerstin in English).  Movie has become iconic and a warm memory in our family.",1387324800,4,490,5.407894736842105
