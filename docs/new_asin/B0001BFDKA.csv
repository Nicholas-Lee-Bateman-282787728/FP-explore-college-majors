8009740,3,B0001BFDKA,"It was okay for a low budget film. Sometimes these types of films end up turning out to be a diamond in the rough. I liked it and I actually like these types of ""underground hood classics"". Not bad at all...",1386115200,,207,4.073170731707317
8009741,3,B0001BFDKA,"If you seriously thought that ""Murda Muzik"" was going to be something like a Hollwyood quality film then you were expecting WAAAYYYY too much. There was not going to be a deep story line with character development with award winning writing and cinematography. This movie was an underground indie flick made by a first time filmmaker with his friends about the ""hood"" for a bunch of rap fans. Prodigy of Mobb Deep wrote the script and financed the movie himself. It was entertaining and you were introduced to other members of the Mobb Deep family. There was a storyline (an aspiring rapper, Fresh, who is mixed up between the music business and the streets) but it did get a bit lost as the movie went into tangents here and there. All in all, given the obvious constraint on movie making resources, it was a pretty good tale.

P.S. If you wanted a real movie, then Prodigy would've needed serious $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ for something like that.",1309478400,,939,4.725609756097561
8009742,5,B0001BFDKA,"WELL IT TOOK MY BOYS 5 YEARS TO RELEASE THIS. BUT HEY WHEN IT WAS RELEASED. MY CREW AND I ENJOYED IT. I FEEL IF U ARE CLOSE- MINDED. MEANING IF YOUR NOT INTO STREET MOVIES. THIS IS NOT FOR YOU.
BUT IF U ARE THIS WOULD BE A TREAT.",1235433600,,229,3.6
8009743,3,B0001BFDKA,"I would only recommend this for Mobb fans only. It's okay to me because I am a Mobb fan but, to Hip-Hop lovers they may not like it because, the acting sucks as well as the production.",1170720000,,184,4.0
8009744,5,B0001BFDKA,"I've always been an Mobb Deep from every since The Infamous Mobb album & have always been a LOYAL fan even through the hard times of their carriers but, this movie wasn't really what expected. Over all I liked it just because it had my dawgs Mobb Deep(Prodigy & Havoc)& Big Noyd in it. It was real LOW-BUDGET!",1140566400,,309,4.344827586206897
8009745,4,B0001BFDKA,"If you like mobb deep youll like the movie

and if you like ganster movies

on a rise and fall level you ll love this movie

Acting is alright

Story is pretty good",1139788800,,164,3.878787878787879
8009746,3,B0001BFDKA,"i usually don't write reviewbut i'm forced to write this one cause the reviewers, i've read, seem to hate too much on this movie. My point of view is biased cause i'm a mobb deep fan. I won't say this movie is the greatest but it's not garbage too. The quality of the image is bad, but the acting especially big Noyd is good for a non professional. The plot is good, some of the scene are not necessary but it's ok for a first movie.
But please don't compare Scarface to this it's like comparing a Shaq cd to a Nas one.",1089072000,,519,4.048543689320389
