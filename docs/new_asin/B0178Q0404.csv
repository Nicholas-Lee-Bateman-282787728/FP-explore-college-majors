8738336,1,B0178Q0404,I bought this for my 5 year old who was having trouble counting up to 100. I tried a few different things before finally looking for something to help her. I saw this and thought it might have some clever or novel way to teach that might help her. I was disappointed by the very poor quality film of what looks like cardboard squirrels. All they do is sing the numbers in order and stack on top of one another. I can see that they were trying to show the repeating pattern of 1-9 after every new 10 but my daughter didn't notice anything. She was bored and said it was weird. I had to agree. It didn't help her and we only watched it once.,1452384000,2,639,4.079365079365079
