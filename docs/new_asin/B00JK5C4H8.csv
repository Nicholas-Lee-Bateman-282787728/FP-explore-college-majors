Mr. Silvera shows a technique for calculating the correct bezel size that works so well I'm amazed to have never seen it in the many books, articles and videos I've studied on this subject.  I prefer videos to books for learning but this instructor is so good I bit the bullet and just bought his book.",1434326400,2,374,4.405797101449275

8651661,4,B00JK5C4H8,This DVD is very good. Mr. Silvera presents in meticulous detail how to apply selected more advanced soldering techniques and even some jewelry making (raised bezel fitting to stone) steps that helped me better understand this art/science. I would assuredly purchase any more DVDs that Mr. Silvera might produce.,1408579200,4,312,5.387755102040816
