3910778,5,B002DKGWXO,"The series ( buy the 4 hour version only) is well done. It is not a big budget show like some of the other econo/history series in the past (i.e. 'The Shape of the World', etc) but works very well for those who like this kind of subject. Here's why I liked it;

a) It is filmed in full screen and fills your entire TV. This certainly helps when some of the photography is of expansive vistas or grand palaces and gives the show an overall big feel.

b) Ferguson does considerable traveling in this show and makes it to all the high spots. The silver mines of the Andes. Hong Kong, London. Paris. Amsterdam, Florence, Pisa, Venice, and thumbing through rare documents such as the Medici family ledgers.  Just the places and things you would expect in such a program.

c) Ferguson interviews some impressive people for the show. Most especially the very rare and ultra blue-blood Fourth Baron Jacob De Rothschild. There they are, the two of them strolling through the jaw dropping splendors of Baron Jacob's palace, Waddesdon Manor, reminisceing about his unbelievably wealthy family. It's incredible that anyone like him still exists in our increasingly socialized world. For me these scenes alone were worth the price of the dvd.

If I would make any changes to the show I would spend less time on recent events ( already documented to distraction) and more on the history leading up to the present.  Half of the 4 hours are devoted to recent events like Katrina and the 2008 crash.

I am certainly glad I bought it !!",1260403200,27,1518,4.620817843866171
3910779,5,B002DKGWXO,"Professor Niall Ferguson really shines in this presentation.  His vibrant animation and his laymen's terms make the finanical history of the world quite comprehensible.  The four hours of this work give ample examples of how money and trade were handled in our past (not very well!).  Ferguson always manages to appear in that country he is talking about:  Peru, Italy, Spain, Algeria, China, New York, to give primary source examples of our finanical history, such as 15th-century handwritten tax records.  This documentary is well worth the four hours to sit through and absorb.

General history with the application of mathematics, the science of interest-earning and speculation, the making of coins and paper money and of course ample examples of finanical crashes, depressions and recession come up in this presentation with reasons for the demise.  The rise of the Chinese economy, according to Ferguson, is our next biggest financial threat.

He not only understands the stock market and finance, but also history, and together Ferguson writes a captivating review of the financial history of the world. A lot of wars were waged over money.

The earliest lenders of money were Jews, who even in medieval Venice had to wear yellow caps and live in their own ghettos outside of the town square.  The reason Jews had become so prevalent in money lending is because in the Catholic church money lending was considered a sin.  Aha!  That opens up a lot of other follow-up questions to our history.  Ferguson quotes several biblical passages for his work.  In the second episode we learn why the Jews became hated by the German Reich:  the Germans blamed the Jewish bankers for a failing stock market across Europe.  We see history and finance blend into one. This is all so fascinating.

The final episode, ""Planet Finance"" really makes viewers understand the current economic crisis, and the history of prime and sub-prime lenders.

This is both good for high school and collegiate-level business or history classes.  The student walks away understanding even the stock market, something I never was able to do until now.

This presentation has gotten me interested in knowing more about Professor Ferguson and watching any other of his works.  He really makes the study of finance seem so easy.

This DVD is divided into four episodes of about 55 minutes each, all on one DVD.",1260057600,53,2381,5.020408163265306
3910780,5,B002DKGWXO,"The many facets of this documentary weave together a coherent and powerful sense of vital information affecting the present and the future. Whether or not you are deeply involved with studying economic theory, public policy, history, or the future, many key features of these things permeate your life, and this DVD can entertainingly provide a mixture of insights, illustrations, and warnings to consider. Facts play a much larger role than speculation in this documentary, though the speculations seem plausible and add to the value of the overall effect. Scholars may find it productive to ask themselves how much they agree or disagree with the speculations and why... then in future decades revisit the video to compare these details with how things actually unfolded. This DVD's use of moving images that metaphorically relate to narration is often profoundly engaging, too.",1251504000,5,880,5.338129496402877
3910781,2,B002DKGWXO,"Stephen Zarlengas book, ""The Lost Science Of Money"" might go along with this movie fairly well: [...]",1251331200,,101,5.0
3910782,5,B002DKGWXO,"PBS viewers will recognize this offering. Ferguson is charming and persuasive. He makes the story something that even my twelve-year old can understand, without ""talking down"". He covers the full range of financial dealings around the globe, from Wall Street to microfinance. His case study of Argentina makes a difficult story relatively simple yet not simplistic. He positively critiques Hernando de Soto's approach ot providing title to land to the poor as a means of securing collateral-based loans and shows where small, uncollaterized loans can work even more effectively.

Great as a serious academic yet never boring treatment of ""high"" and ""low"" finance. Should be required for most college majors.",1249171200,42,707,5.427272727272728
3910786,4,B002DKGWXO,"It takes a certain kind of writing skills to make an otherwise dry subject as interesting as this. It is an interwoven classic of the evolution of finance. The events go back centuries in the past analysing why we have a certain kind of situation today. The explanations of historical events are eye opening such as:
 How did the Spanish thirst for gold contribute to inflation?
 The origin of bank notes and its similarity to promissory clay tablets of ancient Babylon
 The role of cotton bonds in the fall of the Confederacy
 The origin of the Fibonacci sequence and the evolution of mathematics in Europe
 The events that led to the birth of banking
 History of financial markets, property markets and hedge funds

It is a very fascinating read as he gives his perspective of how finance plays a very crucial role in shaping countries and societies. The book is rich with detailed examples and it takes up time to finish this book as it covers such a vast area. It studies the effects of boom/busts and their consequences. He throws light onto the brilliant minds who have helped shape our modern reality of money. Niall Ferguson is successful in depicting our current financial position into the larger context of history.

We recommend it to anyone who likes finance, history and good quality content.",1420156800,,1306,4.799107142857143

3910788,5,B002DKGWXO,"Buy it, watch it, share it.  An incredible journey through the history of money.  While I did indeed watch this on the PBS satellite some time ago, it is certainly worthwhile to revisit, and that's why I purchased it.  Only wish they had stuff like this when I was in school.

3910793,5,B002DKGWXO,I'd seen this piece streaming on PBS a couple of years ago while looking for teaching tools for a high school Economics class. It's not a laugh a minute and teens will have a hard time listening for very long. But the re-enactments are good and the explanations are better.,1358553600,,273,4.48
3910814,5,B002DKGWXO,"I majored in international finance in graduate school.  However, I ended up working in another industry.  After the banking crash, I wanted to know more about not only what happened, but why it happened.  Since my grad school training didn't teach me much about international financial crises, I have read book after book on the banking crash as well as many articles.  This book provides an excellent history of money, and how it has evolved over the years from gold and silver coins to electronic digits stored in a computer.  Professor Niall Ferguson manages to explain a complex subject in an interesting and understandable way.  I was captivated watching the entire series the first time I saw it on PBS.  You will too.  Toward the end of the series, Professor Ferguson explains how we got into the current banking crises.  Electronic storage and trading of money has made it possible to fool a lot of people through the use of complexity and subterfuge.  I highly recommend this series to anyone with an inquiring mind.",1352419200,11,1025,4.839080459770115
3910815,5,B002DKGWXO,"The Ascent of Money explains it all, and with excellent production values. My high school seniors will be watching all segments of this video.

3910816,5,B002DKGWXO,"Learned a lot from this series.  I got it because I previously watched the other series War of the World by the same historian and was duly impressed and enjoyed that.  Great video to learn history about things like how life insurance got its start, various banking schemes and things that are now considered standard.  Failed investment schemes that have changed the whole world, caused goverments to rise and fall, etc.  Definitely interesting to rewatch to catch details one has missed, or to fill back into the overview one can only get by watching the whole thing.  I'd love to see a new chapter/sequel added after our last economic downturn.",1327622400,5,647,4.845454545454546
3910817,3,B002DKGWXO,"Very good first half, but falls short discussing past 100 years. No mention of Latin America, very European in point of view. No indept discussion on the great recession.",1326067200,3,170,4.896551724137931
3910818,1,B002DKGWXO,The book was a waste of time and the DVD follows suit.  Very true but not the real meat of the money matter.  Don't waste your money or more importantly your time.,1314662400,2,163,4.0625
3910819,2,B002DKGWXO,"If you have been around for the past few decades and have been reading the financial news in the newspapers and magazines then don't waste your time with this book. While Professor Ferguson throws thousands of pieces of data at us there are few insightful explanations or insider information. It's a view of someone looking in from the outside, constrained by his academic position.  If you want a brief catalog of the main money events, starting with Mesopotamia and ending with the recent recession, then this will do.
 Contrast this with a superb book like ""The Big Short"" of Michael Lewis . Maybe the difference is he didn't chew off  so much, being outside academia he had more freedom,  and he really spent a lot of time with the people he wrote about. He didn't drop in.
 I will state a couple of things I wanted from the book and you can judge if the above is unfair. After all, Lewis only had to cover a few years. I wwanted more information on why a few thousand top financial people have managed to get such a stranglehold on the economy and why they can do quasi illegal stuff with no punishment. Why can the head of Countrywide mortgage services  take home more than $500,000,000 after leaving millions of people in foreclosures behind him? Why can Ken Lay's family keep all the millions he stole? Why can John Merryweather rise from financial debacles not once but several times, leaving millions of impoverished investors, yet stay rich? I'm not saying he did anything illegal just why did the system let him get away with it,? Isn't failure supposed to punish the people who set it up as well as the investors?  It's as if these guys have found a system where if ""we win I get rich; if we lose I get rich."" What are the social dynamics that permit this? What are the social dynamics that let 99 percent of these guys get away with it? They've kept the yachts and jet planes and now  feed the Republican legislators and 42,000 lobbyists. (And many Democrats.) And what about the morality of it  all? How long can a society worship the Golden Calf and survive? How long can people continue to survive and believe,  that if they do the right thing, the generous thing, they are saps and will be ruined, ? Isn't this worth discussing and explaining in the postmortem? There have been societies that believed that if you have accumulated enough to give yourself and yours the basic comforts, if you then fought and schemed  for much more, you were mentally sick. Or to put it another way, you were a cancer on society. Is that what we have come to?",1302048000,12,2559,4.5292841648590025
3910820,4,B002DKGWXO,"I bought this DVD for my husband, a professor of economics.  He has used it in one of his classes, and has found it not only a clear explanation of economic matters, but also one that engages the students.  Niall Ferguson presents the material in as interesting a manner as one can when dealing with economics.  (That's me, the non-economist, speaking.)",1278979200,9,353,4.754098360655738
3910821,2,B002DKGWXO,"Right off the bat he welcomes us to the world of money but this is misleading because the real culprit in Ferguson's financial ""who done it"" is credit and credit derivatives (easy lending practices in short, because speculation drives ""growth"") and NOT money.

If this is an expose it fails to mention names and show corrupt systems. If it is a lecture, where is the detailed analysis of the system it studies? And why does it fail to provide alternatives? And if it is history lesson, why is it obviously only enamored by the hedonistic high speculative and dangerous techniques of modern finance? But maybe it's a warning, if that is the case its message is not urgent enough or transparent enough to evoke action from the viewer.

But I suppose if you know nothing about modern finance (or sleep in economics) you will now have something novel to add at the dinner table discussion. But this video is way better than the book he followed up with of the same title, which is riddled with inaccuracies, omissions, and errors. Interesting, the more I watch this watch this film (ive seen it 3 times) the more I understand that what Ferguson is really documenting is a history of exploitation.

But what ultimately drew such low marks from me is its lack of synthesis and direction. All the film's jumping around of subject matter and centuries is annoying and paradoxical. This film has the stamp ""approved for the masses"" all over it, it is neither critical nor enlightening for those hoping this an addition to the cannon in financial history; I will say for a person such as that, you would be better off watching Scooby-Doo then expect new knowledge or an interesting viewpoint from this film.",1274918400,16,1697,4.726351351351352
