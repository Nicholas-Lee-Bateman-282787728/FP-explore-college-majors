8312990,5,B001JJRCK2,"We have the iPad version. My son started watching when he was 6 months and loved it. He's 2 now and still watching the videos over and over with no loss of enthusiasm. The impact this series has had on my son is no less than amazing. When he watched the videos on emotions he would copy the facial expressions on the screen and at 9 months one of his first words was ""happy"" or ""I happy"" and from what would be going on it was clear he was using the word appropriately. When he'd get hurt he'd ""I sad"". He'd say these things with the same inflection used in the videos. By the time he was 18 months he was recognizing shapes like octagons, beginning to sing his abcs, using all the sign language on the videos and counting past 5. These are all things we never taught him but are in the videos.",1457222400,,794,4.129032258064516
8312991,5,B001JJRCK2,My ten month old LOVES Sparkabilities. She has been watching the series since she was around 6 months and shows a genuine interest in the program anytime we play it. We have an in-car dvd player for long road trips or meltdowns and Sparkabilities is always loaded and ready. It has improved traveling SO much. Worth every penny.,1452211200,,328,4.672413793103448
