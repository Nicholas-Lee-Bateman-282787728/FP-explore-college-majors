2632360,5,B000H9HJM6,"I bought this DVD as a complement to the classes I was taking twice per week and I really love it!. The workout covers all parts of your body, is easy, very easy to follow and the pace is just right. The fact that Sara is also pregnant in the video, helps a lot to guide you to do the poses. The streching is great and I found out that she actually applies the same technique than in my Yoga class. I think everybody in the third trimester of pregnancy will find this video a very useful guide for a great workout that is just right for the third trimester, not too easy, not too difficult.",1277337600,,590,4.094827586206897
2632361,5,B000H9HJM6,"I do lots of yoga and this one is perfect for the third trimester. I am feeling centered, strong and ready for birth after completing this yoga 3-4 times per week.",1240790400,,163,4.290322580645161
2632362,2,B000H9HJM6,"I thought this was just okay. I did feel very relaxed afterwards and might do it again for the stretching. When your muscles are sore from the gym, for example, this would be nice. But it's not really all that difficult, if that's what you're looking for. Certainly not like a yoga class, though I've never taken prenatal yoga.",1226448000,,327,4.559322033898305
2632363,5,B000H9HJM6,"Love this video. I'm a casual yoga-goer and finally found the tape that works for me!  The instructor does a wonderful job of keeping a nice pace and walking you through each pose. The routine is challenging enough to keep you interested, and the instructor verbally will guide you if you like to keep your eyes closed or focused on your own body, you do not need to keep looking up at the screen to follow along.  I will do this program over and over again until I deliver!",1186444800,,474,4.314606741573034
2632364,5,B000H9HJM6,"I'm currently in my third trimester, and I've been using Holliday's DVDs regularly since the second trimester (I started with her second trimester DVD). I really feel a benefit from using them -- so far I've had very little back pain and I feel pretty limber for a pregnant woman. I just started Lamaze classes and can tell that the breathing I do in the DVD is going to help a lot with that as well.

The issues with the DVD production that some other reviewers have mentioned hasn't really bothered me. It's true, though, that the production value isn't very high and the workout doesn't seem to have been edited. Holliday makes a few little mistakes when she's speaking but after you've done the workout once or twice you can tell what she means, so that really didn't detract from it for me. The lack of music doesn't bother me.

The only thing I don't like about the workout is that sometimes it seems a little rushed when moving between poses (this happened in the Second Trimester workout as well). In the section at the end where she relaxes each muscle with a deep breath, she goes way too fast for me to actually take deep breaths.

Overall, though, a great DVD. Holliday has a very calm, kind personality and the stretches really feel good. I really anticipate that it will help me with my labor and delivery.",1181260800,,1320,4.514644351464435
2632365,3,B000H9HJM6,"I just got this DVD 3 days ago and tried it once, so I can't tell if it's gonna work for me or not when it comes to the program itself, but I'm going to give it a try and do it 2-3 times a week.

The reasons why I didn't like it so much from the beginning were:

1. I didn't like that there was no music in the background. It would be easier for me to concentrate if there was music. If you don't care - it's obviously not a big deal.

2. I do believe that breathing in Yoga is very important and sometimes I found it difficult  to follow Sara's directions when it came to breathing because for some reason what she says doesn't always correspond with what's on the screen. E.g. she says ""Inhale, arms up"" but the video is showing her with her arms down. I find it quite confusing.",1180656000,,781,3.9871794871794872
2632366,5,B000H9HJM6,"My wife tends to put things off . . . she assumed childbirth would work out that way, too.  She fully expected to be on the extended trimester plan, giving birth to a post-term infant who was already in medium Fuzzi Bunz.

So, a mere four days before her due date, she decided it was time to start doing yoga.  She put this in on a Friday night just to listen.  Our son was born the next day.

I'm not saying this DVD started the whole shebang, but it was a soothing way to experience our last night as non-parents.  As a practitioner of various forms of yoga, I think this is an excellent DVD to start with . . . or end with, as the case may be.",1179878400,,646,3.9689922480620154
2632367,5,B000H9HJM6,I am still in my second trimester but I have done this video several times and i love it! It has helped me to become more flexible and to strengthen my body and my mind! I feel like i have improved my breathing and lung capacity and she seems to stretch and strengthen all of the muscles and joints that are sore or uncomfortable from pregnancy. I have really enjoyed doing all of her videos and really feel like i had great workout when i am through. I even feel sore the next day which is something that i love because i know that i am improving! Thank you!!,1170288000,,560,4.146788990825688
2632368,5,B000H9HJM6,I am not pregnant but want to be in shape and ready for my next pregnancy.  I am new to yoga and found all the positions comfortable and natural.  I felt relaxed and refreshed after the workout - the background scenery and ocean sounds were inspiring.  I would recommend this yoga DVD to non-pregnant women who would like a good stretch or pregnant women who want to stay fit and healthy.,1156809600,,388,4.436619718309859
8137726,1,B000H9HJM6,"soooooooo lame.  it was like a hallmark movie desperately trying to be cheesy and sentimental.  i found myself wondering if this was supposed to be a work out video or a dramatic poetry reading.  i was so distracted by her weird comments and overly ""soothing"" voice that i couldn't even stay focused on the stretches, and i was so bored by the slow pace that i found myself checking my email in between stretches.  very slow and boring.  do not recommend this if you are looking for an actual workout or exercise.  it's more like geriatric yoga than prenatal yoga.",1457222400,,564,4.59
8137727,3,B000H9HJM6,Very repetitive and boring. For fourty minutes I don't feel that I did very much. I found a free 15 minute prenatal yoga on demand on my tv and it was much better than this.,1453161600,,173,3.9714285714285715
8137728,5,B000H9HJM6,"I don't typically do yoga but in preparing for the birth of my first child I figured it was the best thing for me to do to prepare my body & it is doing just that. After only a couple of weeks of doing this video- and you can do it every day, it's amazing!- I feel stronger, more flexible & more prepared for child birth than I was before. I'm sure continuing this for the next few weeks will only make delivery go more smoothly than without the breathing, exercises & movements.",1392508800,,479,4.161290322580645
8137729,1,B000H9HJM6,"I found that some of her poses were irresponsible in how long we are asked to stay in some of the positions (being in 3rd trimester pregnant) and never stating that if you can't go into these positions then do not push yourself or offer alternitve suggestions (like every yoga DVD I've ever own does)
With out trying to sound pety I also found her to be sideways in her stance, and her hands in prayer pose always to the side, I just found this DVD annoying and not only difficult to do but also to watch.
You also have to sit through her whole self serving introduction before every session, there isn't a skip option. I got her credentials the first time.",1390521600,,657,4.349593495934959
8137730,5,B000H9HJM6,Great DVD. I used it throughout my 3rd Trimester.  I have regularly done yoga for several years. This routine provided just enough stretching and relaxation for me during this time. Purchased at a great price.,1380240000,,209,4.9714285714285715
8137731,5,B000H9HJM6,"I am on day 3 and LOVE IT! I was cautious of working out until now, my 3rd trimester and I feel great during the dvd. I was concerned because I have done minimal stretching up until my 7th month but am feeling up to speed after just a few runs of the dvd. I recommend it for any fitness level. You are able to pace yourself and modify but there is nothing too intense in the workout that I think most can't handle. My fiance even sits and does the final breathing and stretching tech's -- very cool if a non-yoga man wants to participate :). So far, I have gained 9 lbs and looking to keep my weight gain minimal and healthy. I love that I feel more limber and relaxed after the session. The breathing tech's were challenging at 1st as I am not used to totally breathing (inhaling/exhaling) mouth closed -- BUT I do hope it helps during labor. Enjoy your workouts!",1360540800,,864,4.210843373493976
8137732,3,B000H9HJM6,"I like the DVD (2nd trimester), but thought it would have wished to have more than one short workout on it, for variation. Not much on it, honestly , was it 35 min?",1352937600,,164,4.0
8137733,3,B000H9HJM6,"I bought the second and third trimester dvds because my yoga studio only has prenatal class once a week.  There isn't any calming background music with this dvd, and her voice isn't very soothing while she constantly talks.  Poses aren't held very long...we're always moving, but at the same time it feels like we're not doing anything.  I like to stay in a pose and breathe through it for a bit.  There also isn't much variety, just bending this way and that way over and over again.  I was a little bored.  It's an okay workout and I felt okay after it, but just okay.  If you really like a relaxing yoga experience that puts you in your own utopia in your head (that's how I feel during really good yoga) you might want to keep looking.  Of course, no dvd will feel quite like the real thing, as you're watching and listening to the TV and losing the natural feel and connection with the earth and yourself, and of course with baby.",1350777600,,935,4.364161849710983
8137734,1,B000H9HJM6,"I am disappointed with this DVD. It doesn't even seem like yoga. It seems like a series of jerky, spastic stretches. She doesn't hold poses - she jerks them over and over. For example you won't hold a hamstring stretch - she has you bounce up and down repeatedly which isn't helpful. Yoga Journal's Prenatal Yoga is much better.",1282780800,,328,4.576271186440678
8137735,2,B000H9HJM6,"I bought this DVD for my wife who is pregnant.  Compared to other DVDs she has tried, this one is not as good.",1279065600,,110,3.782608695652174
