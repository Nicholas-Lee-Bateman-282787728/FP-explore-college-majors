1239735,4,B00000K0DV,"In my opinion, Lucio Fulci's ""New York Ripper"" is as every bit perverse and deranged as his later ""Dangerous Obsession"" a.k.a. ""The Devil's Honey.""
A burned-out New York City cop gets stuck  on a case where a madman is chopping and slashing up young, beautful women;  hookers, models, athletes, sex-show performers and anything else the blade  can touch. If a ""normal"" director was given this cliche`  storyline, this film would be not much more than another murder-mystery.  However, Fulci takes ""homicide"" to a whole new level without his  classic use of zombies or the supernatural. Fucli even has a bit role as  the Police chief and is dubbed with a rather amusing Yankee accent.
The  Anchor Bay DVD print is beautiful and properly letterboxed.
Packed with  plenty of S&M, nudity and arguably the some of the most convincing gore  in Fulci's 20-year directing career, this is one horror/giallo film that  will NEVER make it past the BBFC. Check it out!",961372800,5,956,4.9125
1239736,3,B00000K0DV,"This is Fulci's most unpleasant film, but not all for the right reasons. To be sure, the violence featured is revolting, especially the death of the final victim by close-up razor slicing. We also get a broken bottle rammed  into a naked womans crotch, and many other sleazy scenes. However, the film  is very ugly to look at, with nearly all scenes being set in dull streets,  apartments and offices, with lots of tiresome dialogue as the main  character, a police detective, tries to find the murderer. Apart from the  grisly murders and one strange hallucination sequence (also with violence!)  set in a cinema, there isn't much to hold the interest visually, none of  the characters are interesting, and the story is laughable, especially the  explanation of the killer's ""Donald Duck"" voice...don't hold your  breath. Watch Fulci's gothic horrors like ""House By The Cemetary""  and ""The Beyond"" instead.",957312000,,907,5.0675675675675675
1239737,4,B00000K0DV,"Hmmm... I can sum up this review in one word regarding this hellish slasher flick! ""BRUTALITY"" & lots & lots of it!  This is a bloody movie about a sadistic killer that loves butchering young-pretty  looking babes. This movie does NOT slow down at all... I was mesmerized  from the beginning to the very bizarre end! Nice line up of characters as  well... The death scenes are pretty graphic and are NOT for the faint-of  heart. The nipple scene is pretty sick as well as the eye tearing! This is  truly worth purchasing!",953942400,,521,4.548387096774194
1239738,4,B00000K0DV,"This is undoubtedly one of the most notorious films ever made, and when I bought it I thought that I was in for a real sleazefest. However, I was surprised to find that it is a clever, well-made giallo, which kept me  guessing till the end(but then again, I've always been hopeless at guessing  who the killer is in films like this). The movie is like a vintage Argento  film but without the fancy camerawork and long, tedious scenes of boring  dialogue. It's not as gory as it's reputed to be, but it's every bit as  sleazy. The most harrowing thing in the film, however, is not the violence  but the scenes of the little girl in the hospital bed. Anyway, a good film,  well worth checking out.",952560000,2,695,4.3828125
1239739,4,B00000K0DV,"OK - Everyone's heard about this one, claimed by many to be Fulci's grimmest hour etc. However, upon actually viewing it, I was very suprised to find a film that, whilst certainly containing much sadistic violence and  gore, is well-made and quite realistic. Fucli's idea of merging the lines  between a horror and thriller film have paid dividends in this movie.
It  is intense, sometimes not easy to watch and the last victim is litterally  slashed to ribbons (including eyes). However, the plot does make sense, it  has reasonable acting and the re-mastered release available now, is simply  top-notch.
If you want a ride into hell and back, then let Lucio Fulci  take you deep into the nightmarish world of a downtrodden New York, with a  vicious serial killer on the loose.
One of the only films I've seen that  virtually deserves its reputation as a shocking, sadistic and quite  disturbing movie.
You have be warned!",948758400,9,923,4.858974358974359

1239744,4,B00000K0DV,"I bought the uncut version of The New York Ripper a few years ago watched it, didn't think a whole lot of it and threw it in a box in the spare room with all the other DVD's I planned to trade in one day.

 Anyway I've just moved house the vast majority of the trash got traded in but I kept some iffy movies aside, ones that I felt didn't quite warrant a place in my collection but I couldn't bring myself to trade in for 40 cents and one of the many I held onto was The New York Ripper which I watched again last night and after seeing a few other Fulci films in the time since now have a bit more of an appreciation for.

 I still don't think it's a great movie certainly not in the league of ZFE or The Beyond but it's got a lot going for it. The gore, the unrepentant sleaziness of the old NYC, the beautiful women (which seems to be a Fulci trademark) and the obvious red herrings. Despite the violence and the misogynistic tone there is a charm that I find alluring and am glad I a few years later re-watched it and now have a better appreciation of the film.",1463702400,,1066,3.9906103286384975

1239747,4,B00000K0DV,"The New York Ripper is a slasher unlike anything put out by a American Producer/Director it's hardcore and in many ways doesn't pull any punches
It's a time capsule of the ""Original"" Old NY that was sleazy and dangerous
This film could never be re-made or even copied (This point and time in America could never be replicated)
It's best descried as a Grind House meets 70's Porn
On my first viewing I honestly didn't like it at all or understand it
After several more times with it I can say It's maybe one of the most under-rated Psychological Thrillers hidden beneath a Gorey Slasher Film
There's a number of strange layers to the story. But, it's very smart and logical in 1982 through today you don't get something like this very often..
The back drop City of NY is very much a character and you get the 52nd Street NY pure unadulterated sleazy and grime

Jack Hedley as the old beaten down cop (Great Casting) he looks like a burned out Cop that seen alot of stuff his performance is really good
almost all the cast consists of Italian Actors
almost all the actors do pretty good for this type of film
The one Blonde who is introduced past the half way point looks like a Eastern European Super Model (Just Flawless)
The Gore & Sex run neck and neck
the gore F/X are extremely good (without a doubt better then 70% of all the Gore through-out the FT13 Films) But, that's Not there fault mostly the  MPAA This on the other hand Rated X aka NC-17
The scene with the Milf at the pool hall is really cringe worthy where these sleazy looking Latin King Members are taking there toes and playing under the table... It goes on for way to long and it makes you feel dirty (I'm sure that was the point)
While sometimes it goes to far to try and be a porn then it has these really inventive Hitchcock Style Shots
as bizarre and out there this film can be  It's a  true Homage to  Alfred Hitchcock

The Blu Ray put out by Blu Underground is a very fine HQ HD transfer (it looks smooth, you can see details, once in a while see can see film grain but for a movie this old you should expect that imo
this is the best way to get a physical HD Copy of the film
the extras are a bit lacking (which is a Shame) better then nothing
If you are a major fan of  the Original TX Chainsaw Massacre & TX Chainsaw II you sound really get a kick out of this
If you still unsure the El Ray Network has played in the past NY Ripper Uncut so sometime DVR it then you can make up your mind
 Lucio Fulci still in 2015 isn't nearly as known to the mainstream Horror Fans
The IMD Ratting is Horrid 6.4
Without a doubt deserves at Least a 7.5 more slasher fans should embrace this film 'Cause it's a one trick pony yes but it's a one trick pony with Rabies!  It lives up to that old saying you can't judge a book by it's cover",1437264000,5,2797,4.174397031539889

1239760,3,B00000K0DV,"I knew a little about this film from an expert in ""history's sickest and sexiest movies"" who called it ""vile."" So I wasn't as surprised with what I experienced -- I found the sex more gratuitous (and sleazy) than the rather over the top violence & gore. (And I feel like the Amazon Instant Video version might be a toned-down version, at least some of the violent scenes?) So I don't think this film is vile. I find something like Smurfs 2, which apparently has set records for the amount of product placement in it, far more vile than a film that explores the darker aspects of human sexuality and violence. The scene in which the first victim hears the Donald Duck voice and reacts with her face is classic, and I wonder if it was scripted or not.",1417478400,,749,4.39568345323741

Thus begins Lucio Fulci's most notorious film ""The New York Ripper"", the most misogynistic film this side of William Lustig's ""Maniac"". Police detective Fred Williams (Jack Hedley) is after one sicko who cuts pretty women up in the cruelest fashion. The killer's Donald Duck voice is ludicrous and annoying, but the rampant nudity, over the top gore, red-herrings and the ultra-sleazy atmosphere make up for that in spades. It doesn't hurt that this is tightly scripted and nicely filmed either. This would be the last film in the second (and starting with ""Lizard in a Woman's Skin"" best) era of his three part career. The last and worst part would start with his next film ""Manhattan Baby""",1404864000,,915,4.725

Someone who talks on the phone like Donald Duck is killing prostitutes in some of the most grotesque ways you have ever seen on screen. You won't care who the killer is, you'll just be waiting to see what he does to his next female victim. Late director Lucio Fulci leaves nothing to the imagination and that is just the way we gorehounds like it. Is it misogynistic? Sure it is, but that's not the point. The point is to see gory, gruesome murders in loving close-up. Recommended for those only with strong stomachs.",1395446400,,594,4.409090909090909

This film probably seems more ""controversial"" today than it did in 1982.  I remember when it came out and there was a flood of violent, intensely sexual thrillers playing theaters at the time: dozens of slasher films and even comedies like ""Porky's"" which were huge hits but would never make it past censors or ""family values"" police in 2013.

Enjoy it for what it is: an entertaining, engaging and well-paced thriller with sleaze, thrills, suspense and a wonderful, trick ending.  Much recommended!",1380844800,5,754,4.769230769230769

Now obviously two things are needed to make these movies a success on is nudity and over the top kills.
This movie has enough of both to satisfy most.
Maniac left me baffled as how can anybody think it's ground breaking stuff. (maybe back then but this movie is only a year older and much better as far as I'm concerned)
And Prowler was not even half the movie I thought it would be.
That being said this is decent enough to merit three and a half stars.
It's the closest to what I think a clasic sleazy slasher flick should be like.
Of course it's all objective as the varying review ratings will atest it's just this one had more of what I have come to expect from an 80's slasher flick.",1354838400,,806,4.2064516129032254

I bought this to replace a dvd copy I used to have and that included the razor nipple scene in its entirety and was much cheaper. To think that this company tries to claim this ""the most complete"" version of New York Ripper available today is inconceivable to me. Maybe in the UK. Which is a place I just decided I will never set foot in. This is my favorite Fulci movie. Fulci is my favorite director. If I can't return this blu ray I'll take it out in the street and burn it.

1239777,4,B00000K0DV,"Filmed at the height of the early '80 slasher craze and released in 1982, ""The New York Ripper"" is actually one of the genre's most intelligent, well-written and professional-looking offerings (compared to ""Friday the 13th"" or ""Slumber Party Massacre"").

Despite the fact that our killer has the bizarre calling card of quacking like a duck when stalking his victims or taunting detective/leading man Jack Hedley on the phone, it doesn't come off as silly as it sounds. There are red herrings aplenty and it wouldn't be inaccurate to label this as one of most misogynyst films I've seen. The victims all have their ladyparts assaulted in the most vicious of ways (although only the razor blade scene made me look away).

Lots of location shooting in New York makes one nostalgic for the era (the interiors were filmed in Rome which becomes obvious in some scenes since I've never seen any American homes that resemble the structures we see onscreen).

The 2009 widescreen release by Blue Underground looks fantastic but there are several instances where the dialogue seems off from the actors' lips. I'm not sure if it was dubbed or this occured transferring the film elements to DVD. Still, one of the best-looking and well-produced slashers from the era.

1239778,5,B00000K0DV,"Some people may look at the cover and title of this film and expect it to be an 80s slasher film with a high body count, but this particular film is a little different.  It doesn't have a high body count, but the kills linger on the graphic and gory details.  The film has a psycho who talks and quacks like a duck. I thought this is different and original compared to other 80s slasher films.  In between the kills the film basically switches between a detective trying to solve the case, a nymphomaniac who sleeps with and gets fondled by strangers, and another girl who escaped from the killer.  The kills in the film are much nastier and have more impact than what you would find in a FRIDAY THE 13th film, and some may find them disturbing.  There's also a lot of nudity and some of it is very explicit.  In one scene Alexandra Colli, the one who plays the nyphomaniac, has a stranger fondle her underneath a table with his feet, and she also has another nude scene which is full frontal and explicit.  Zora Kerova, another really good looking woman, has a really good nude scene as well. Other nude scenes are also present; it certainly delivers plenty of nudity. The film is also very well directed, and it's main soundtrack is a very 80s style music score that I thought was very catchy.  However, I think some people may find the film to be a little boring at times.  It doesn't have the misty and windy atmosphere that you would find in some of Fulci's other films, and some people might think that it gets a little too talky at times for a slasher film.  The entire movie has a nice 80s grindhouse feel; and I think it's one of Fulci's best films, but not everyone will like it.

The DVD quality is great and there's a good interview with Zora Kerova. I've got both the standard DVD and the Blu-ray. The Blu-ray is the proper way to see it as you get a really clear look at all the full nudity and graphic gore.

1239780,5,B00000K0DV,"If I had to think of the perfect example of the giallo genre of Italian horror/suspense movies, I'd say it's got to be 'The New York Ripper', original title 'Lo squartatore di New York'. Misogynistic, dark and grisly - the low-budget video nasty is about a killer with a Daffy Duck voice slashing up women in the city and the prostitute-visiting detectives trying to track him down. Lucio Fulci, known affectionately as the ""Godfather of Gore"" by us horror freaks, can always be counted on to serve up the sex and blood like antipasto. The on-location setting, 1980-1981 pre-Giuliani Times Square sex and seediness, only adds to the dark grittiness of it all. One personal favorite scene of mine involves two Hispanic punks and a very, ahem...disturbed woman in a grimy bar.

1239782,3,B00000K0DV,"In the seedy grim streets of New York, there lives a psychopath who talks like a cartoon duck as he wonders the street at night and attacks people mainly women as he butchers them in vicious horrific ways. Detective Fred Williams is trying to solve these grisly mass murders and who is this mysterious duck talking killer as he is trying to find the clues that could lead to him.

One of the most horrifying movies of all time and Lucio Fulci's most controversial and brutal film. Inspired by earlier galliaos (Italian thrillers) and Maniac (1980), this unpleasant slasher thriller is somewhat interesting at times but sometimes it's difficult to watch. It has been condemned as filthy misogynistic gory trash while some of Fulci's fans call it a classic but anyway it is a cult classic. There are horrible scenes of murder and torture even to an eyeball and nipple which rivals the same scene used in ""Ichi The Killer"", this movie predates today's torture shockers and possible influence on films like ""Hostel"", the ""Saw"" series, ""Se7en"", ""The Untold Story"", ""Inside"" or even ""Martyrs"". The music score is creepy at times and even funky at times like the opening theme and the acting is quite good, Fulci did get the blamed for being a sexist gore loving pig when his film was released but who can't blame the guy since he has been called an Argento wannabe. The film was banned or censored in some countries except in Japan which they dig Fulci's movies.

Along with THE BEYOND and CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD, this is one of Fulci's masterpieces. It is surreal is the scariest possible way. In Fulci's films, logic doesn't always exist and I'd have it no other way. Logic = comfort and predictability. Fulci turns our world upside down by showing us just how unstable reality can be. Now, in NEW YORK RIPPER, reality is a bit more intact but the human psyche is not. In Fulci's New York, people are crazy and/or perverted as hell.

This movie is SLEAZY. Take the sleaze factor of CRUISING and times it by ten. No, times it by twenty. It'll make you feel dirty.

I'm reluctant to call this a giallo being this was made during the later period of the genre and it's more influenced by slasher flicks than the murder-mysteries of the late 60s/early 70s. But even for a slasher film, this is brutal, sadistic, and unsettling. The fact that we see a lot of the killing in POV of the quacking killer (yes, the killer quacks like donald duck), is even more discomforting.

Why does the killer quack like a duck? There's a reason and it does make sense. Those who complain about it are those who are stuck in their Jason Vorhees/Michael Myers box. Killers have to be silent and stalk around. No. Some psychokillers are crazed maniacs who babble and speak. This killer is HUMAN and he's killing out of a psychological need for....

With ""New York Ripper"" Fulci serves up sleazy characters, gaudy lighting and makes violence look gruesome and horrible. There's also the quacking, Donald Duck-voiced killer, another poke at giallo convention that typically has a raspy voiced killer making threatening phone calls.

Fulci is quite respected in the Horror community for his often gruesome or revolting zombie films but somehow people overlook a lot of his other great works unfortunately. New York Ripper may be one of his most beloved pieces of art amongst fans & easily one of my all-time favs. I watched this one on some lost weekend & found myself playing it over a couple of times which is uncharacteristic of me but who cares. We like what we like & whoever said you be ashamed to admit such?

Ripper features some of most tense, eye-twitching montages of suspense I've seen in quite some time & I personally think Lucio actually rivals Argento here in many respects. I can't really speak for others but the razor scene alone made me a bit squeamish although I have seen this film 5 times. Fulci's history in giallo prove to be one of his greatest strengths in film-making which include his overlooked classics Don't Torture A Duckling or The Psychic. Both are criminally ignored classics.

There has been much talk of the overall kinkiness this film proudly exhibits & how Fulci himself allows his artwork to be reduced to this low common denominator. This may very well have been the case but how about looking at how well the death scenes are executed & the excellent use of color or lighting during these scenes of human depravity? Are we so narrow in our viewings that we cannot somehow appreciate the artistry that Fulci was capable of dishing out in heavy doses? Ripper also has an amazing music score which isn't unlike some of the classic mystery shows on television which is totally impressive. Most importantly, who better to play the New York Police detective than Jack Hedley, who delivers a crisp but cool performance to match the film's icy touch.

Sadly, we don't get to see films like this anymore or we get heavily sanitized versions of great horror in which the MPAA has had their field day. Yes, we might get a decent horror endeavor that's snipped to ribbons but the unedited versions aren't always readily available. Snatch this one up while you still can from Blue Underground & skip the garbage that seems to fill up the multiplexes. You will be glad you did.

It's his most infamous because of a serial killer doing a Donald Duck impression and seeing a lot of women cut up in various gruesome and sick, sick ways.  The film has all the usual Fulci ingredients:  bad story, atrocious dialogue, bad dubbing (though I'm sure this would be a piece of garbage in Italian as well), crappy camera work, just all around unprofessional, tacky, and a complete waste of time.  I kick myself a lot when I decided ""I should give this guy a chance"", so I saw a lot of his films (too many), and I dread the name Fulci, as it is synonymous with ""worst films ever made"".

I think the BBFC did the larger viewing public a disservice when they classified this as a ""video nasty"" (and other Fulci works), because it made many people go out and seek it out.  They should have just let it slide through and labeled it ""mediocre, preposterously s****y, enormous toilet dropping of a movie"".  I sometimes think that because Fulci is so reviled by many that people assume he must be a genius that ""film snobs"" or ""elites"" don't get.  This isn't true at all.  He's just a really bad filmmaker who made a couple of decent films (Zombie is his most consistent), and upped the gore quotient in the horror genre.  Just because a government body like the BBFC (British Board of Film Censors) ban stuff like this doesn't make it art, you know.

This film is really SLEEZY, wich I don't mind and love about it.

Other than that it delivers and what you expect from Fulci. Women are being turned up dead left and right and it's up to a detective to solve the crime. The killer talks like Donald Duck and that was disturbing. I will never look at Donald Duck the same way again.

1239798,3,B00000K0DV,"A reputation can be a terrible thing. In the napalm-blast of

1980s' fear concerning movie violence, many worthless slices of

cinematic dross acquired undeserving kudos by virtue of the

'video-nasty' label, while several genuine works of art (A

Clockwork Orange, The Evil Dead) were dragged under the wheels of

the juggernaut of public paranoia.
Fulci's The New York Ripper is a film that deserves to be

extricated from the censor's dungeon and reappraised, not as a

shamelessly mistreated classic but as a video-era schlocker

that's tacky, tonally incompetent and, above all, completely

harmless. Fulci's silly slasher belongs to the subgenre of balls

'n' all gore films that can trace their lineage back to the

bloody, zero-value outpouring of Herschell Gordon Lewis. The plot

lurches unevenly from one torture-scene to the next, with a

near-comatose Jack Hedley as a nominal hero cop who sleepwalks

through the mire of cod-psychology and seedy sexuality that Fulci

favours in lieu of a decent script. Just as in hardcore porn,

plotting, characterisation, dialogue and direction are irrelevant

window-dressing to the money-shots of flesh-ripping on display.

There is a gleeful sadism evident in the scenes of

broken-bottle/vaginal interface, nipple-slicing and eye

bisection, but nothing that will faze fans of the Hostel or Saw

franchises. Indeed, there is an almost quaint, kitsch appeal to

the ropey latex mutilations, with Fulci's stark, almost careless

camerawork resolutely embracing the no-frills style of

exploitation cinema. This truly is the stuff that Eli Roth's

wet-dreams are made of.
Lit like a peepshow, and boasting just as much cheap titillation

with as little artistic merit, Fulci's Ripper is a camp curiosity

that offers some basic sustenance to gorehounds with an interest

in the history of the  genre. The absurdity of the 'duck-voiced

killer' conceit suggests that Fulci probably didn't take this

nonsense too seriously, an approach which every viewer should

wholeheartedly adopt. You may baulk in disgust at a few moments

of lingering body-horror; but mostly you'll just spend the 93

minutes' running time sniggering.",1207526400,7,2175,5.4324324324324325
1239799,4,B00000K0DV,"The New York Ripper is probably the most brutal movie in Lucio Fulci's career; The New York Ripper doesn't feature the gore Fulci was known for at the time, but this is probably his most sadistic movie. The New York Ripper is gory at times, but that isn't what makes it brutal; the kill scenes are very disturbing at times. The scene when the killer slices the girl up with a razor is cringe worthy. The glass bottle to the crotch is deeply disturbing.

Like I said the violence here is quite brutal in other Fulci flicks the gore is over the top, but in a good way it makes the movie even more fun. It's hard to take the violence too serious when the blood starts shooting out in what seems like gallons. But The New York Ripper on the other hand has a real sadistic maybe even mean spirited violence the gore is plenty, but nothing like movies like Zombi 2 or The Beyond.

Horror films are often labeled misogynistic and it might be hard to argue against that with The New York Ripper. Do I think that is the case with the movie? No not at all, but the violence against the women in this movie is so raw it's hard to argue that the movie isn't.

The New York Ripper is one of Fulci's movies that sparks great debates among his fans; some think it's one of his best others say it's one of his worst. As much as I enjoyed The New York Ripper it's not without its flaws. The biggest problem is the sexual content of the movie. Sex in movies does not bother me at all, but here it just seems it was thrown in there to help reach more of an audience. Honestly when all was said and done a lot of these scenes were not needed and could have been edited way down.

None of the sex scenes really add to the plot and had they been cut down I think The New York Ripper would have moved at a much better pace, but hey it's in the movie and nothing can be done and at least the women are hot. I don't mind sex and nudity, but in my opinion it does sort of slow the pace down.

The screenplay was written by Gianfranco Clerici, Vincenzo Mannino, Lucio Fulci and Dardano Sacchetti. The screenplay is your basic Giallo nothing here really stands-out, overall the script isn't bad, but I don't think we watch Fulci flicks for their brilliant screenplays. All the writers here should be known to fans of Italian cinema. Clerici and Mannino were writers on House by the Edge of the Park and Clerici was a writer on the infamous Cannibal Holocaust. Lucio Fulci and Dardano Sacchetti have teamed up quite a few times and I have always been pleased with the outcome. The New York Ripper had a good writing team, some things work and others don't.

As director Lucio Fulci, is able to craft some solid scenes and create some pretty good tension. Like I stated earlier in my review the sex scenes do slow the pace down, but Fulci does a pretty good job here and this one is mostly coherent. Often in 80s Fulci things sort of happen with little or no explanation. But, for the most part The New York Ripper makes sense. This really was Fulci in mean mode; the kill scenes are very brutal. Like I said the gore level is good, but nothing like some of his other flicks, but what they lack in gore they make up for in brutality.

At the time this movie was made, New York wasn't the safest city. It was filled with crime and a lot of sleaze and Fulci is able to capture all that in this movie. What I think is the biggest problem with The New York Ripper is the killer talking in a duck voice and even quacking like one. Lucio Fulci manages to put together some great moments filled with tension, but than the quacking starts and well it's a tension killer. It's hard to take a killer talking in a duck voice too serious and when he starts quacking it can be difficult to keep a straight face. The reason for this is explained at the end and it does make sense, but it is a bit silly and does break up the tension.

The New York Ripper is also kind of tragic; the finale is quite sad and despite some of the silliness The New York Ripper is a brutal movie and the final minutes are quite tragic, but very fitting.

In closing, despite the flaws of The New York Ripper it is a solid Giallo; while not the best movie of Fulci's career it's an enjoyable one. If you are a fan of Lucio Fulci it's worth checking out. But those of you who don't like his work, I highly doubt this movie will change your opinion of him.",1194739200,6,4388,4.195729537366548

It is a very strange and dark slasher filled with sex and sleaze that takes place in New York and is up there as one of my favorite Fulci flicks.

The cinematography and story are excellent in this one, and even though the thought of a killer with a duck voice is kind of cheesy, there is a very good reason for it and I think it's pulled off really well.

For beginners of Fulci, I'd recommend Lizard in a Woman's Skin, but if you want to watch a violent murder mystery, this is it.

Many people mentioned the scene of the nipple and the eyeball. Well, it is grotesque, but I didn't found it that scary. The Donald Duck voice is one of those details that, before seeing the movie, I thought, what a stupid idea, but the execution (excuse the pun) here is everything, and it really works.

I had to sit down and have a glass of water. I wish I could wipe the memory from my brain. The end.

Now, I can't think of a better endorsement of this film for a gorehound:

(Though you kinda get the impression that professional horror writer's are often vaguely embarassed of the genre, so they gotta show that they have there limits, and thus be deeply offended by something)  It's pretty gruesome, as far a this sorta thing goes, but other films do come plenty close to it.  And yeah, the killer singles out women, but that's not exactly rare. (Though, those claiming that women are killed far more often than men in slasher movies are full of crap.  Sometimes they are, sometimes not, and overall the difference isn't that big.  In fact, I remember reading a study, comparing the top 10 slasher films from '81, '85, '89, respectively, and it came to the conclusion that more men died, overall.  However, I seem to recall that a number of the films on there aren't what I'd call slasher films, so I don't know how accurate that really is. Anyway...)  I find it particularly funny that Fulci has been labeled a misogynist due to this film.  Sure, all those other movies where he horribly mangled both sexes extensively were meaningless, but this one, where he solely focuses on women, ohh, this means a whole lot.  (And, of course, this was actually done for thematic/plot/dramatic purposes.  If you can believe such things, this film actually has a moral, of a sort)  Anyway, long story short, if you find this film offensive, you're a douche or a sissy.  Maybe both. (Or I should say, if you find it morally repugnant.  If you just think it's distasteful you may be alright)  Still, this movie isn't really very good.  It's alright, worth a look, but I'd definitely say you oughta just rent it, even if you really like some of Fulci's other stuff.

Anyway, I could try and talk about character and plot and whatnot, but ehh.  It's a kinda garden-variety Giallo, meaning that the killer's motive is silly, and that you couldn't possibly guess who he is other than through sheer blind luck.  But, who watches this sorta film for the plot?  Stylistically, I was shocked by just how Fulci-esque this film is.  Since it approaches horror in a very different way, eschewing the zombies and other supernatural stuff of his last few films I assumed this would kinda feel different.  Nope, all of Fulci's trademarks are still here, with the extreme close-ups and bizarre fetishism, and slow, drawn out gore.  And what can I say, I enjoy Fulci's extremely distinctive style.  It is a bit different in that it's got a lot of gratuitous sex and nudity, which gives it all an extra-smutty feel.  Also, the soundtrack isn't up to par, as he uses a weird electronic-disco-jazz kinda thing.  It's sorta fun, but the Frizzi stuff from `They Beyond' and `City of the Living Dead' is way better.

In the end, what makes this film passable instead of good is that the killing scenes and stalking scenes just aren't all that great.  The stalking scenes just lack any real suspense or any particularly interesting staging.  The one exception is the scene where a character has to slip out of bed, having just slept with someone who may be the killer.  Also, she's tied to the bed, which complicates things. Also,  some of the gore effects are kinda painful, but none of it is all that interesting.  For the most part, Fulci's interested in brutality rather than creativity, a method which doesn't really suit him.  His gore effects have never been very realistic, so he's gotta make em interesting, at least.  There are two scenes which are pretty extreme, the two scenes which doubtless earn this film it's reputation.  They're pretty nasty, all admit, but most the rest of the stuff doesn't do too much to me. (One involves slow mutilation with a razor, the other a broken bottle going somewhere it really shouldn't go.)  The intensity of the murder scenes is severely undercut but the killer's fondness of using a Donald Duck voice.  So, much of the time when the killer's doing someone in, he's quacking his head off.  Pretty funny.  Dunno why Fulci thought doing that would be a good idea, though I guess he didn't actually write the script.

This isn't one of Fulci's more revered films, and it shouldn't be.  It kinda falls in a middle ground.  It's pretty gory, but the gore isn't very fun, as this film is pretty sleazy, and it doesn't have any fcool zombies.  So, it doesn't really work as a serious film, but it's too dirty to really be enjoyed as camp.  Still, I was sufficiently entertained.  Obviously, you'll wanna see some of Fulci's more famous stuff before even considering looking into this.

1239806,4,B00000K0DV,"When I first read the reviews about ""The New York Ripper"" it definitely sounded like a movie that the avid gore hound should check out. Well I couldn't find it anywhere. So I decided to buy it.

While I don't believe it is Lucio fulci's best movie I did find it to be pretty good. It is nothing like his other films with zombies and other creatures from the depths of hell. ""The New York Ripper"" deals with a maniacal psychopath that slices and dices his way through The Big Apple. Of course being a Fulci film you can expect the usual terrible acting and horrible dubbing, which always makes me laugh, and yes the killer quacks like a duck but the killing scenes are in typical Fulci fashion (GORY!) A woman getting gutted, a broken bottle shoved into the forbidden area, a nice straight blade through a helpless victims eyeball and nipple, and an impressive head shot at the end of the film.

You've heard all the other reviews. The film is seedy, it is misogynistic, violent, brutal and there's plenty of T&A to satifsy fans of the flesh. I found it to be well worth adding to my collection. If you haven't seen a Fulci film before may I suggest ""Zombie"", ""The Beyond"" or ""City of the Living Dead"". If you have seen Fulci films before check out ""The New York Ripper"".

1239814,4,B00000K0DV,"As you'll read numerous times over, this is Fulci's most unpleasant , sleazy and ugly film.  I think there's two reasons for this: 1)  It's all centered in the real world as opposed to the supernatural world Fulci is known for, thus losing the fantasy element.  2) Alot of sex.  If someone's not having sex or prancing around naked, there's always some sexual undercurrent going on, making this quite sleazy.  In my opinion, the most disgusting scene being, not one of violence, but a game of ""footsie"" that seems to go on for ten minutes.  This part is really bizarre, surreal, and just plain yucky.  Yeah, we all know the plot:  A sadistic serial killer(is there any other kind?) slices women up into olive loaf, taunts hard boiled detective, tra-la, tra-la.  The plot's nothing new, but this is Fulci, people!  Which means you get all the trademark gore from his supernatural horrors transplanted to a slasher flick.  You also get all the bad dubbing, acting and funky tunes translated too.  Basically, if you like his other stuff, you'll like this coz it's still a gory Fulci horror flick-it's certainly not gonna appeal to anyone else!  There's a pretty crazy scene when our ""duck"" killer is slicing up a woman tied to a bed.  This is pretty whack!  Does Fulci shy away from the carnage and let your mind fill in the gaps?  Nosiree, Bob!  He just lets you sit back and watch the killer drag a razor blade across the poor girl's eye!  Yikes!  Sure it looks fake as hell, but it's what it represents that counts.  I'm willing to bet by the feel of this film that Fulci's girlfriend must have left him around this time or something, coz he doesn't seem to like women too much here.  This film comes across as a way of lashing out or something.  Sure it's very juvenile and Type O Negative-ish, but it does make for an entertaining movie.",1059609600,3,1839,4.559633027522936

1239816,3,B00000K0DV,"i have seen several Fulci movies and have been shocked by something in each one.  In ""The New York Ripper,"" i was somewhat disappointed.  Part of it, i think, is that i saw it took place in New York City, and was expecting New York actors and well written English dialogue, instead of the poor dubbing that is associated with his movies.  That was probably my fault for expecting that from an Italian director.  However, that aside, i found the murder and gore to be sub-par compared to the things i've seen in ""Zombie,"" ""City of the Living Dead,"" and even the apparently horribly butchered version of ""The Beyond"" i own entitled ""Seven Doors of Death.""  With this movie, what i was really hoping to find was a gritty, more reality-based Fulci movie with the same brutal viciousness and gore offered by his other more supernatural-themed movies.  However, what it lacked in gore it more than made up for with blatant misogyny, which was ever-present and strong throughout this movie, ensuring to stroke the woman-hater in all of us. (What, ""there's no woman-hater in [you],"" you say?  Right, and michael jackson only had two nose jobs.)  i guess Fulci was trying to focus more on sexual excess and perversion that can sometimes be a prominent aspect of human nature,  than on the excessive gore that typified his movies in this one, but it just didn't really seem to work very well.
Overall, the characters are as shallow as in any of his movies, the plot is somewhat hackneyed, and the gore is not nearly what i had come to expect from a Lucio Fulci movie.  However, it did have its moments, such as the razor blade bisecting the nipple, and is definitely worth the watch and probably the purchase too, especially for the Fulci fan, as well as any other disturbed individuals who enjoy gorging themselves on violence and the humiliation and degradation of other people, namely women (not that i condone that sort of thing.)",1045958400,2,1924,4.699404761904762

Well, The New York Ripper, overly wrought with commentary about unpleasantry that ""shocks"" and an ""overriding unpleasantness (that) makes it an acquired taste at best,"" is no exception to the bias rule. Railroaded by critics for a sadistic approach to serial killing (and leaving me to wonder when serial killing became a flower picking contest in the process) and then banned by most international venues except in the most butchered formats, this exceptionally brutal film mingles many facets together to paint a bleak rendition of what drives men to murder.
We are given the oddities of a serial killer that chooses a Donald Ducklike voice (which is later explained in the movie) as he vents his anger on the unsuspecting female population of New York and plays mind games with the detective supposedly hot on his trail. Filled with razor blades slicing through varied body parts, throats meeting unfortunate demises, people acquiring unfortunate limps, and an almost sad ending, this movies meets the criteria of something pleasantly contrived.

The killer quacks like a duck.  No joke.  To be honest, the most disturbing thing about this flick is not the gore or any real scares (there are none) but the story behind the childlike quacking, etc.
Gore?  Sure.  But you've seen just as good gore in better context and better films.  I have to give MUCH credit to the throat slashing scene where the POV is from INSIDE a victim's throat as it is sliced open, so that we see the killer and then the dripping blood.  Sounds sick and kind of is, but very stylish.  Kudos.
Otherwise, we get Jack Hedley, looking like he's killing time between AA meetings or something walking around New York without any real urgency to catch the killer.
The film is [inexpensive], low budget, and has that sleazy feel--you know, the one where you feel guilty for having spent 2 hours watching something like this.

Indeed, it is rumoured that after watching the film for the first time in the early 1980s, the BBFC ordered it to be removed from the country forthwith, complete with a Police escort.  To be fair to the BBFC, the film is indefensible in many respects - I do not recall seeing a single man in the film who did not sport some extremely reactionary views about women, and the lingering graphic violence portrayed against the female victims does indicate that Fulci had some 'issues' with women himself.  That said, however, this has more of a coherent plot than most Fulci films and considerably better pace. I watched this alongside 'Bloodsucking Freaks' and compared to Joel M. Reed's film, this comes across as 'Citizen Kane'.

The screen is Fulci's canvas, the blood is his paint, and you can never tell quite what you're looking at, but you know it's disgusting in a lot of parts. Fulci's other films (that I've seen) include ""Zombie,"" ""The Gates of Hell (City of the Living Dead),"" and ""The Beyond."" The latter is the best film I've seen from the director, but this one I would rank right underneath it, mostly because it does exactly what it sets out to do, it disturbs us with its gore-effects, and it's endless brutality against women. The other Fulci-isms are there, too: An eyeball gag, tons of gratuitous nudity, and point of view shots we'd rather not see (in this case, a woman's erogenous zones looking down a broken glass bottle, but we'll ignore that for now so I can type without littering the screen with my vomit).
The plot of the film is very simplistic, like any cop caper you see on TV at two in the morning on USA: A sadistic woman-killer is on the loose, cutting up women in the worst possible ways, and one cop in particular is the target of this guy's affection. One cool little nuance in the film: The killer sounds like Donald Duck. There's not really a whole lot else to say. This is a movie that doesn't thrive on the details of plot as much as it does on Karo Syrup, which poors out of sliced orafices in abundance. But there is an issue here that's going to deter women and any woman-respecting male from wanting to sit through this movie: It is absolutely, 100%, relentlessly brutal towards women. Every murder sequence is shown on screen in elaborate detail. There is almost nothing left to the imagination. Fulci doesn't cut away just as things are getting their worst, and if he does, he always cuts back right in time for the blade to cut across a part of the woman's body that will have audience members clutching assorted body parts. This is an exploitation film, as well, using a New York City sex house as a backdrop for one of the more corrupting sequences I've ever seen committed to celluloid. Nudity is virtually in your face almost every five minutes in this film. Heck, even the good guy has a prostitute, and of course, she has to walk around naked during the cop's midnight phone call eating yogurt or something.
Pubescent boys will love this film and its gore. Women will never go out with the guys who don't squirm.

[Lo Squartatore di New York]

(Italy - 1982)

Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Techniscope)
Theatrical soundtrack: Mono

It's virtually impossible to defend THE NEW YORK RIPPER on any level - the film's up-front misogyny provides director Lucio Fulci with the flimsiest of excuses for several landmark splatter scenes in which beautiful women are stabbed, slashed and razored to death in graphic, lingering detail. Abandoning the Gothic fantasy of his 'Golden Period' (1979-1982) which spawned such miniature  gems as ZOMBIE and THE HOUSE BY THE CEMETERY, Fulci's grim examination of the sexual excesses of contemporary New York follows a stereotypically hard-boiled cop (Jack Hedley) in pursuit of a  psychopathic killer who's been murdering a succession of women in the Big Apple, most of whom are depicted as prostitutes or depraved sluts with a taste for rough trade. Yeah, it's that kind of a movie...

Despite a mild twist near the end which throws the killer's identity wide open, the plot has few of the intricacies normally associated with the giallo thriller and instead relies on splashy set-pieces to maintain forward momentum. Luigi Kuveiller's hand-held camerawork evokes an appropriately realistic milieu whilst also making the film looked rushed and sloppy (this is the same guy who photographed Argento's baroque masterwork DEEP RED!), while  the cast does its best with the ungainly dialogue and amateurish dubbing. The standout is Alessandra Delli Colli, playing the beautiful wife of a rich cripple who records her sexual adventures on audio tape for her husband's pleasure, until she finds herself tied to a bed beside a man who may (or may not) be the killer! Given the frankly unpleasant nature of some of the material she's asked to play, her performance here demonstrates a  level of commitment which goes way beyond the call of duty.

Overall, the film exerts an undeniably sleazy appeal, and while the target audience will certainly admire its audacity, others will be appalled by its uncompromising scenes of horror. Either response is equally valid.",961459200,16,2087,5.243243243243243

7914016,3,B00000K0DV,"THE NEW YORK RIPPER (1982) gets started when a man's dog makes a gruesome discovery, while walking along New York Harbor. Lt. Fred Williams (Jack Hedley) is on the case, of what turns out to be a series of grisly murders. Someone is hunting down and mutilating young women, all while quacking like Donald Duck! The lunatic also speaks, sounding like ""Fats"" the ventriloquist dummy from MAGIC! Williams seeks the help of expert, Dr. Paul Davis (Paolo Malco- HOUSE BY THE CEMETERY). Can these two track the madman, and catch him before more women die? Simultaneously, a bored, sexually starved doctor's wife, Jane Forrester Lodge (Alexandra Delli Colli- ZOMBIE HOLOCAUST) indulges in everything from live sex shows to indecent, anonymous foot massage! Yikes! Containing the usual gore overkill, this could be Director, Lucio Fulci's most crackpot film! Not only due to the gore or the wonky killer, but also because of Fulci's obsessive focus on the perverse and lurid. In this movie, just about everyone's a creep, pervert, or perverted creep! In particular, Delli Cossi's character is so reckless in her adventurous endeavors as to beggar belief! Sleazy from opening to closing credits, the mega-violence is just the bloody icing on the meat-cake. It's understandable to a point, in that Fulci is exploring the 42nd Street underbelly, but still, this movie takes it to its ludicrous extremity! Today, in this internet age, such a movie is rather quaint, even farcical. More of a parody of its subject matter, which, if that was the intent, is downright astounding...",1521417600,2,1566,5.097276264591439

7914020,4,B00000K0DV,"A killer, with a duck-like voice, is stalking women in the streets of New York, and detective Fred Williams is on the case. New York Ripper is a great 1980s trashy, ultra violent Fulci film, with a great score. Still not sure the plot makes much sense, but who cares that's not why you watch a Fulci film anyways. The Blue Underground Blu Ray looks and sounds fantastic, but it's very light on extra features.

Highly recommended for fans of 70s/80s horror films with an edge to them. Throw on William Lustig's 1980 film Maniac after this, for a feel good night of watching movies.",1504310400,,581,4.533333333333333
