6859243,5,B00Q6Y2AV6,"There are two movies.  The first, It's Christmas Carol, was very disappointing.  It's a take on the Dicken's Novel.  Eve Miller (Carrie Fisher), the former company founder, takes Carol Huffman (Emmanuelle Vaugier), the successful book publisher on a trip through Carol's past, present, and future.  The acting is terrible -- Carrie Fisher ruins the movie.  On the other hand, The Wishing Tree is a delightful story about a professor Evan Farnsworth (Jason Gedrick) who teaches three of his students to believe in themselves, and along the way, with the help of the town and a special Wishing Tree, Evan discovers that anything is possible.  Ditch the first, buy the second.",1419984000,3,673,5.072727272727272

8690613,4,B00Q6Y2AV6,"As the Editor-in-Chief of the Dickensian Christmas Carol Blog, I collect and review every adaptation of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol that I can access a copy of, so I was delighted to discover this one, starring Emmanuelle Vaugier as ""the Scrooge.""  The late Carrie Fisher plays Eve, who stands in for all of the Ghosts.

It was a little awkward for me to see these actresses, whom I've come to think of as CSI:NY's Detective Jessica Angell and Star Wars' Princess Leia, respectively, in such drastically different roles - especially Carrie, whom I had never seen so old!  But the ravages of time helped me see Ms. Fisher in this new role.

Set in a fictitioius version of Chicago, in the Twenty-First Century, this adaptation is rewritten enough to stand alone, but gives a nod to the classic novel that inspired it, as Carol Huffler, the modern ""Scrooge,"" looks it up, online, to see what happens next, right before Eve comes creeping up behind her, looking like the Grim Reaper in a cowl.

Olivia Cheng plays Kendra, who stands in for Bob Cratchit.

Kendra is single, so there doesn't seem to be a Martha, Peter, or Belinda, let alone a Tiny Tim.  Perhaps Carol's elderly, neglected mother (Susan Hogan) is the ""Tiny Tim.""

There's no ""God bless us, everyone!"" But least there's ""Merry Christmas!"" and ""Happy Hanukkah!""",1488240000,,1328,4.793859649122807
8690614,5,B00Q6Y2AV6,"It's Christmas, Carol is a personal favorite of mine. I can watch Christmas movies any time of year. I need the uplift that only that kind of pure optimism can provide!!  Of the two movies, beyond any doubt Carrie Fischer's film rates at the top. I love the theme of the Charles Dickens' story in any form. There's a good reason it's been done and redone in different settings with male and female protagonists. The NYC publishing scene was the perfect place for a Scrooge to find a new beginning. This one offers a biting comedic punch that I adored.

The Wishing Tree was good in a sentimental kind of way. These add up to an excellent value. Most definitely recommended!",1478217600,,673,4.553719008264463

8690619,5,B00Q6Y2AV6,"I had viewed each before purchasing this combo set (ordered, not yet received).  I am a huge fan of Carrie Fisher's humor and waited 2 holiday seasons for this to come out on dvd. I had the same wait for The Wishing Tree, but it  is a totally different type of film - poignant rather than comedic.  However, each have their place in my holiday movie collection.",1425340800,3,361,4.358208955223881
