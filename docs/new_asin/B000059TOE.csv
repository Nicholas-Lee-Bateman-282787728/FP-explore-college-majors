7934155,3,B000059TOE,"In America, poetry today has pretty much gone the way of the rest of the arts, wherein a treatment of something iconic, the Virgin Mary, for instance, has to be daubed up in elephant dung to be noticed and appreciated, however scornfully, at all. In the case of poetry, when the First Lady seeks to raise the national cultural consciousness a bit by hosting a poetry slam in the East Wing, we hear people coming back with such comments as how lame it is to see white people up there trying to be rappers... and not without reason. It's all bound to be Modernist/Post Modernist poetry, after all, the only kind that can ever hope to find a venue these days, anywhere here in New Philistia. And Modernist poetry, well, it's just really not very good, actually does sound more like rap than anything else, and generally not very good rap at that. Too often more like ""textured"" linguistic elephant dung.

In a world which has come to so abhor the beautiful, it can be easy to forget that there actually has been such a thing, from time to time, as good American poetry. And not just Emily Dickinson, who, unfortunately, just raises the bar too high for the rest of us poetasters, and has to be sort of set aside in a class by herself. There has also been Edna St. Vincent Millay to prove, in the first third or so of the twentieth century, that others could do it too, that Emily wasn't just a one-off fluke. Back in the day, Millay was world-famous, a poetic rock star, mobbed by fans at her readings, and deservedly so. She was a real poet, who could write real poetry, rarely dabbling in Modernism, but, alas, that's just the good news. The bad news is that she was a real poet, who could write real poetry, whose lack of interest in Modernism would be sure to get her hooted out of the East Wing or pretty much any contemporary poetry slam and make it pretty impossible for her work, some of the best poetry ever written in the English language, to find a publisher if she were alive today. A poet doesn't just need a voice, he also needs an audience with ears to hear, something today's tin-eared public, weltering in the din of ubiquitous Modernist elephant dung, has been relentlessly forgetting how to do.

We have all been much disserved by the history which has so disserved Millay, most of whose poetry still reads fresh as a daisy, as opposed to how gracelessly other American auteurs, Jack Kerouack, JD Salinger, even F Scott Fitzgerald, have aged since their heydays, in such an ephemerally fad-happy culture as ours where nothing of us ever seems to last but our regrets. In her day, even then surrounded by Modernism in all its burgeoning manifestations, the Jazz Age ""Girl Poet"" kept to the formal conventions, rarely seeking to innovate or shock, because she didn't need to, versifying as she did with an authentically poetic power that can still today, nearly six decades after her death, jump off the page and grab you where you live. Few enough of us ever get to experience that today, a sense in which this little video tribute is bound to be a good thing. Sited as it is at Millay's own Steepletop stamping grounds, currently being restored by a dedicated museum foundation, the video is still not able to give us much sense of the impishly fascinating long-departed poetess herself, but it does give us some very nice recitations of what she left behind; her oeuvre. It ain't Gone With the Wind, but it ain't ticky-tacky either. It's a very nicely mounted art poetry presentation, and, best of all, definitely not elephant dung.",1243123200,,3549,4.58740157480315
