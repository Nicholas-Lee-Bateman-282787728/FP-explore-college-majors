He came to absorb the androids to become complete. He seems to be another creation of Dr. Gero's. Piccolo merges with kami so that he can fight this new power. The new villains name is cell. Vegeta and Goku realize that they need to be stronger and ascend so they decide to go to the hyperbolic time chamber and train, because in the time chamber you can get a whole year worth of training in one day. While this is happening piccolo fights android 17. Cell shows up and absorbed 17. Vegeta and Trunks training is complete by this time and head towards cell is defeat him. Now it is gohan and gokus turn. Vegeta finally gets to cell and shows him his new power. Cell gets beat up and asks vegeta if he can find 18 and become complete for a better fight.
