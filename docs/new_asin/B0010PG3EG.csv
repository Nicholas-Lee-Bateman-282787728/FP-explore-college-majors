8238175,3,B0010PG3EG,"I  mostly wanted to write this review to let folks know that this is a fairly slight program weighing in at just around 25 minutes. The time makes  me think it was a half hour presentation for television. It has a ""local"" or ""Cable access"" feel to the production values or lack of same...so I would recommend  to Rutger Hauer fans who would like to see an interview even a short one. He was promoting his book at the time.",1246492800,,422,4.25
