That seems to be the case in ""The Dreadful Hallowgreen Special"" starring the gregarious mad scientist ""Dr. Gangrene""  (a/k/a Larry Underwood) and the fetching witch ""Penny Dreadful"" (a/k/a Danielle Gelehrter).

Lovers of schlock have to hand it to Alpha New Cinema for providing a venue to many talented people who produce independent films with very limited budgets, and that's the beauty of it all. There is a very real connection between ""The Dreadful Hallowgreen Special"" and the low-budget horror movies revered and showcased by these two engaging TV personalities.

As a kid, I received my ""monster movie"" education from a lovable TV horror show host named ""Sivad,"" wonderfully portrayed by the late Watson Davis. Sivad's ""Fantastic Features"" ruled the airwaves in the Sixties and Seventies from the studios of WHBQ-TV in Memphis. There were few Mid-South Baby Boomers who didn't get scared witless and have to sleep with the lights on thanks to Sivad.

Dr. Gangrene, Penny Dreadful, and their fiendish friend Count Gore de Vol carry on the time-honored tradition of TV horror show hosts that goes back to the 1950's with such legendary hosts as Vampira of ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" fame.

""The Dreadful Hallowgreen Special"" DVD has something for everyone. The Halloween special is a fun, time travel romp back to the very first Halloween and some surprising discoveries.

The ""extras"" in this DVD package are all clever and well worth watching. The first entry in the ""extras"" section is a creepy award-winning short film entitled ""Thumpers.""  It's about some young ghost hunters who encounter much more than they bargained for when they pay a visit to a forgotten Tennessee backwoods cemetery late one night.

""Penny's Holiday Special"" showcases some of her wickedly amusing skits with the help of her supporting cast of characters.  Penny's hugely popular TV horror show ""Shilling Shockers"" is aired in the New England area.

""Trailer Terrors"" is a contest between Dr. Gangrene and Penny Dreadful to see who can show the scariest trailers from some of their favorite low-budget horror films such as ""Carnival of Souls"" and ""Attack of  the Killer Leeches.""

And there's also a nice collection of Dr. Gangrene's ""Go Green"" series of Tennessee TV public service announcements. The doctor has a cult following of his own with his ""Creature Feature"" Nashville TV horror show that's been on the air since the 1990's.

So if you are interested in a fun collection of light-hearted madness and mayhem that pays tribute to the wonderful genres of monster, horror, and science-fiction films, then look no further.  And let's hope that we never get too old to enjoy a good scare in the night, and that we still have the option to sleep with the lights on.",1329264000,5,2830,4.980891719745223
