7969119,5,B00006I03U,"This was a great purchase along with the original Ocean's Eleven.  It gave a great background story and profile of the ""Rat Pack"" and what it took to make this movie happen.  Hey, those guys liked to party a LOT more than work, so the fact that the movie was completed is a major headline, let alone that it was such a good movie.  I didn't realize it until I watched this documentary that all of the members of the Rat Pack only appeared together at one time - during the final scene.

This is definitely a keeper for my collection for me.",1392508800,,540,4.213592233009709
7969120,5,B00006I03U,"For any Rat Pack fan, this is a must. EO Eleven, brings the swing back to life in a well presented assembly of vintage info regarding the fellas as they merge for the big score. Ringa ding ding!",1220054400,,194,4.131578947368421
7969121,3,B00006I03U,"This is something I had been looking for a long time. Its just what a ""Ratpack"" fan wants. Lot of information on the personal life of the friends. It also in the end came out as a lesson in real friendship. The tecnical quality is not so good. To say the least. I wish it was better. That is the reason for my 3 stars.",1202860800,,318,3.9076923076923076
7969122,4,B00006I03U,"Being a big fan of the ""boys"" I recently purchased and really enjoyed the behind the scenes look at ""Ocean's 11"". The original is still the best. Today's poor copies...11, 12, and 13 don't come close to the original.
This DVD is a must if you enjoy the original Rat Pack?!",1195948800,3,272,4.352941176470588
