8359002,5,B002A6FDLI,"Here, music lovers, is the authentic behind-the-scenes biography of Franz Liszt.
  More or less.
  More less than more.
  Ken Russell's assault on the senses caries a delayed timing mechanism.  Hours after seeing Lisztomania, you suddenly snap back and think, ""My God, what was THAT?""
  Sure, Russell's musical mindstompers are largely a matter of taste.  Tone-deaf Daltrey and Ringo Starr as Pope Innocent III may be cool enough, but the great thing here is that even Russell's most outrageous subconscious fantasies hardly deviate from the historical line.
  Liszt did have a fan club who followed him around Europe.  He did have more than a fleeting affair with Princess Caroline.  His daughter, Cosima, did marry Richard Wagner.  He did become a religious zealot in later years.
  The bit players aren't forgotten either.  Hans von Bulow, Lola Montez, Count d'Agoult, George Sand, even Rossini and his pastrami sandwich.  They're all here.
  That's just the players.  The film itself includes the rise of Wagner, rape of the Vestal Virgins, the creation of a Siegfred Superstein (Rick Wakeman accompanied by Rick Wakeman' electronic cacophony on the ""Magic Fire Music"" theme), a beautiful Chaplinesque reverie in Switzerland, the court of Czar Nicholas, Wagner's flight to Liszt at Weimer after taking the side of the revolutionaries, Casima's voodoo doll, the eradication of the Jews, the death of Hitler.
  More movie for your money, eh what?
  Russell has made numerous films on the lives of composers.  And he explains it this way:
  ""Most of my films on composers work on a stream of consciousness technique.  Given the music and its content, the facts, and the challenge of condensing an artist's experience -- or part of it -- into a little over 100 minutes, then for me, at any rate, there is no other way.""
  The casting itself is a critical part of the game.  Here Brahms and Berlioz, who meant little to Liszt, are seen as perfect reproductions of the men they depict.  Wagner (Paul Nicholas), on the other hand, comes complete with fangs and a ""Nietzsche"" headband.  Paul Nicholas, whom one supposes may well regard himself as something of a Superman in real life, is a natural baddie.  He was earlier seen as the sadistic Cousin Kevin in Russell's ""Tommy"".
  An intense love-hate relationship is soon formed with Casima (Veronica Quilligan), who is required to qualify both as the darling daughter of Liszt and the ""bride of the Anti-Christ.""  This role is a cinematic triumph.  The caricature is naturally a more personal one to Liszt than it was to Mahler, who [in Russell's film of that name] encountered Cosima's ghost as a haughty stormtrooping Valkyrie.
  Footnote:  Hungarian director Charles Vidor died in 1959 while filming a life of Liszt.  It was completed and released as ""Song without End,"" and I remember it as the best straight musical biography I've ever seen.  It'd approach a transcendental experience to watch these two flicks back to back.",1492732800,,2976,5.020533880903491
8359003,3,B002A6FDLI,"If you haven't seen the movie, it stars Roger Daltrey (The Who) as Franz Liszt and Paul Nicholas as Liszt nemesis, Richard Wagner, both from Ken Russell's ""TOMMY"" made the same year both are rock music oriented films.",1271376000,3,217,4.7368421052631575
8359004,5,B002A6FDLI,"As some-one who is given to regularly reviewing the works of Ken Russell (against my better judgement), a completely (often deliberately) misunderstood and unjustly derided film-maker, you eventually reach some kind of review-brick-wall. A point from which it's impossible to progress any further. Enter 'Lisztomania.'

'Lisztomania' is Russell's MOST misunderstood and MOST unjustly derided motion picture. I'll bet much filthy lucre he laughed like a drain while he shot it.
If ever a film, jam packed with fabulously garish and disrespectful visuals, was designed and clinically executed with the sole purpose of goading pompous, humourless, over-reverential critics - 'Lisztomania' is definitely it.

Where else can you see iconic composer Richard Wagner grow a pair of vampire fangs...make an Aryan monster (Thor -  played by overblown organ-obsessive Rick Wakeman!)...stage a thoroughly nightmarish 'Rape of the Rhine Maidens' with the perpetrator sporting a Star of David tattoo (on his forehead!!)...teach innocent little kiddies anti-Semitic rock songs about 'Teutonic Godheads'...die...then return from the grave as a Hitler moustached Frankenstein's monster, firing an enormous guitar/machine gun at a spaceship full of his and Franz Liszt's ex-lovers, who are trying to bomb him ?

You can't...
Only (and much, much more) in 'Lisztomania'.
See Ringo Starr as the Pope: ""Raped at gunpoint?....well it happens to the best of us my son.""
Gasp at the brilliantly unfeasible nudity; reel at the disgraceful marrying of beautiful classical pieces with vulgar rock lyrics; fall on the floor and roll in the mud as Roger Daltrey's hair miraculously changes from 70's curly-perm to straight shoulder-length half-way through the film - making a mockery of any attempt at continuity...
And I'm just scratching the surface.

'Lisztomania' is one of the most entertaining films ever made; it's also one of Russell's most autobiographical as well as the most historically accurate of all his biopics.
None of this matters a jot, I'm just trying to justify the pneumatically opinionated excess and comically distorted abandon with a fact or two. Give the delirium some gravitas and worthiness.

Ken won't thank me. Likewise those tediously boring classical music bods who will never recognise that the art they so revere and champion was of its time populist and often reactionary, won't thank him.
'Lisztomania' is Ken Russell slowly raising a middle finger to the critic, to the elite and to organized religion - among (many) others.

Unfortunately, when mega-conservative David Puttnam and his un-enlightened, un-prepossessing cohorts realized what Russell was doing with the money they were giving him...they didn't give him any more; and without the backing of Lord and Lady Muck at the BFI, he never again achieved the kind of artistic success as his insane 70's period.
He's made good films, but never really re-captured that desperate energy and dash he possessed in such abundance.

Those responsible should hang their heads in shame as the limo drops them at yet another red carpet event celebrating 'the Bank Job.' 'Four Weddings.' 'Notting Hill' or whatever lumpen mush is passing for British movies these days.

They won't, but the fact 'Lisztomania' exists at all will serve to remind them that Britain could once turn out a real film and not just a dispassionate corporate formula.",1242518400,11,3393,5.386792452830188
