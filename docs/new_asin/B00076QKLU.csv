2202285,2,B00076QKLU,"This movie(can NOT be categorized as a documentary movie!) is based on an assumption that Moses killed Ramses II's son.  Interestingly the archeologists found a skull of a murdered that is, more likely, closely related to that of RamesesII as indicated by x-ray analysis.  The skull for that murdered person for unknown reason had been suppected to be for the son of Rameses II_the only clear reason for such claim was the location of the skull discovery!  Based on the bible, the investigators/archealogists started to investigate wheather the son of Ramses(the discovered skull) had been killed by God or Moses..The narrators mentioned that, based on the bible, the older son of Ramses II had been killed by God and this explains why Rameses II left the jews leave Egypt!!!!!!! Then, the movie postulated a lot of additonal scenarios for how this person had been killed! The most acceptable one was that Moeses was in charge of killing the older RamsesII's son.  Moreover, the movie makers assumed that there were two phoarohs survived the Exodus; the first one  (erronously, based on the movie, was Ramses II) who brought Moses up and the second pharaoh,the murdered person(presumably is the son of Ramses II!).  This was really so amayzing!!!!  But, what are the proofs for such claims?!!!! Besides, the movie showed moses as if he were a follower of Akhenaten!!! Anyway, I found the forensic analyses were so good, but the whole story of the son of Ramses II was really a supersition!.  Highly recommended for people interested in forensic medicine; Not for those interested in real aracheological findings!",1148688000,6,1612,5.033834586466165
2202286,1,B00076QKLU,"What a nightmare!  About 99% of this movie is based on wild assumptions.  About the only real and credible evidence that they have about the ""skull"" is that the somebody ""died"", and probably died in battle or possibly due to murder (gash in the skull).  As the movie progresses, it seems obvious that these guys set out and were ""bent"" on butchering the Biblical account of the Exodus.  They even butcher the account of the Red Sea crossing by ""explaining"" that the ""RED"" sea was mis-translated, and was really the ""REED"" sea, and they actually take us there in the movie; it's just an oversized SWAMP!  The Bible states that the people of Israel crossed the sea on DRY ground (not a knee-deep swamp) with a ""wall of water to their right and to their left""!  Doesn't sound like a swamp to me.  Supposedly, in the SWAMP, the people of Israel waited in ambush for Pharoah's army.  When the army got close enough, Moses and his people jumped out from behind the ""reeds"" and slaughtered the army.  What in the world are these people thinking?  Pharoah's warriors were well-trained butchers, fully prepared for battle, mounted on horse-driven chariots!  The people of Israel were loaded down with their household belongings, etc, NOT WEAPONS!  Nor were they trained to fight; they wouldn't have even been able to hold off the army for even a minute, much less ""slaughter"" them.  The whole thing doesn't even make sense!  Based on the ""evidence"" they present, I get the idea that the ""skull"" was from a household servant perhaps.  They don't even know if it was the right Pharoah or not.  My opinion is that your money will be better spent on a thoughtful gift for your significant other.",1144800000,7,1682,4.689419795221843
2202287,1,B00076QKLU,"Poorly done - mostly fiction with no fact!  Good for entertainment but not for science.  I was totally disappointed and believe now that the intent of the DVD was to do a hatchet job on the bible - and done poorly.  The DVD starts out like it is going to trace the biblical Exodus to Egypt's Pharaohs and tell what really happened to the Pharaoh's first-born son - was he killed by God's wrath or by man's wrath.  The DVD reminded me of a Laurel and Hardy movie - sending Egyptologist Weeks and journelist Sennet around Egypt in a comedy fashion. It starts out with finding a skull, believed to be Rameses' son and half-way through the DVD they find out that this skull is not the skull they were looking for and so they tossed it and took another skull from the tomb (four total in one mass grave - which is kind of strange for Pharaoh's sons) and reconstructed this skull to look like what they think Rameses's first born looked like without any evidence that it is THE one.  Rameses is alleged to have over 100 children. Overall, the producers of this DVD didn't know where the Red Sea geograhical crossing took place, where the mountain of God was located or where the burning bush was located or at what date this all took place, or under which Pharaoh, etc - all of which I believe now to be wrong in their hypothesis.  Since their hypothesis didn't agree with the bible, it didn't dawn on the people putting this expose together that they might be looking in the wrong places, time, Pharaohs, etc; so ... they changed the bible text! Is this what schools are teaching for science today?  I recently ordered and reviewed the DVD Exodus Revealed and the book Exodus Case by Dr. Moller, both which are outstanding and CREDIBLE and based on science.  In these two items - they do reveal where the crossing took place and where the Mountain of God (Mt. Sinai) is, as well as finding evidence of Pharaoh's chariots on the bottom of the Red Sea. I recommend these two as a must see if one is interested in the Exodus Red Sea crossing and would wait to see the Rameses DVD on Discovery, Nat'l Geographic and other PBS channel types.",1143590400,6,2131,4.432225063938619
2202288,5,B00076QKLU,This cd inspired a whole new world for my 7.5 year old boys.  They loved it and wanted to learn more about the Egyptian Pharaohs and the interesting twist is the way they tie in Moses.  We took out the children's bible and they understood where in time the old testament fit in.  I was delighted.,1140566400,,296,4.25
2202289,4,B00076QKLU,"Regardless of the commercial breaks and the repetition of information, (And it being 1am =D) the program overall was very interesting. I've often wondered about the 10 plagues story, how the exodus story was described from the Egyptian POV. It was great to see a scientific view to the what may have really happened.

It's wonderful how our scientific technology has come so far to put faces on the skulls we find from generations back. (Have you seen King Tut??) It puts a real face on these stories that are so old, they seem to be fables and about people who didn't really exist. This program also showed the process used to put a face on the unknown remains found in the tomb.

I love studying Ancient Egyptian history and this was a great addition to my knowledge.",1137801600,3,769,4.565217391304348
2202290,3,B00076QKLU,"This movie was alright. from a documentary point of view it had it's downfalls. At the end of the documentary I had the same knowledge as I did at the beggining. The movie doesn't really answer any questions but ask the same ones over and over again. If you want information on Rameses II try picking up a book. Although I loved the fact that they showed a lot of the tomb, and the recreation of Rameses and his family was also good.",1133136000,,433,4.228915662650603
2202291,3,B00076QKLU,"This program brings up good questions and the evidence looks convincing but a DNA test would give an absolute answer. Sadly, 90% of this show was the same thing being repeated over and over again. Also there is another thing, in the begining the historians talk about the battle of Kadesh. What in the name of Ra does that have to do with the story of the Exodus? Very little if you ask me. I think they were ""trying"" to connect the two. (well if Ramses the second lied about the victory at Kadesh, then he may have lied about the Exodus too)Let's Find some undeniable evidence before we start trying to rewrite history, okay kiddies!",1123977600,6,634,4.474137931034483
2202292,1,B00076QKLU,"Fluff. At least that what this program is. For86 minutes you get alot of repetition in the scenes and narration. It could have been sliced down to 30 minutes. The film continuously asks the same questions over and over and over but reveals very little in answers. It gets confusing because they jump from this to that to over there to back there and then they ask the same question they asked 12 times before without even giving any basis for the question in facts. At one point one Dr. asks another Dr. a question, and she replies she doesn't know she has to ask somebody else. We're all glad she was on that dig! The reenactments are beautifully filmed, about 5 minutes worth, but shown over an over and over....It woud have been better if they told the story of Exodus, told the story of what they THINK really happened, then shown what facts and evidence they have. Instead you get 83 minutes of fluff and 3 minutes of fact. So repeat after me a thousand times....""save my money...save my money...for something else!""",1121644800,5,1021,4.554347826086956
2202293,3,B00076QKLU,I found this dvd to be entertaining though I cannot vouch for the facts. This was from the Discovery channel and you could certainly tell where the commercial breaks had been because they repeatedly told you what program you were watching. That got to be extremely annoying. If not for that I would have given this four stars. It did raise some interesting questions about the truth behind the story of the Exodus and give one someting to ponder. I would definitely like to see more about this archaeological site and hope they do a DNA test to see if the skeleton found truly was Rameses' son. I would recommend renting it first or borrowing it from the library before buying it.,1112313600,5,680,4.581967213114754
8045229,5,B00076QKLU,very interesting documentary,1431907200,,28,8.666666666666666
8045230,5,B00076QKLU,Excellent product & service.,1429401600,,28,6.25
8045231,2,B00076QKLU,This show repeats itself continuosly. the part on the ten plauges really strecthed some truths to fit it's agenda. I could not finish watching it. There are many more historical and better dvds out there. the parts about the skull they found [with Kent Weeks one of the best Egyptologist] was interesting but I couldn't watch the whole thing to find out who they decided it belonged to. someday I will finish it but not now.,1316304000,,424,4.592105263157895
8045232,1,B00076QKLU,"We did not get past the first 5 minutes, what trash! I just subjected my kids to nudity. Thanks discovery channel!! This is why we do not let tv just stream in our home.  Just because a nipple is not showing does not mean this is ok! PLEASE can we just have a decent historical film w/o nudity?! From the reviews I am glad we did not waste our time. I realized from the first words out of the mouth of the narrator this show was anti-God! Shame on me for renting it!",1284508800,,466,4.010752688172043
8045233,5,B00076QKLU,"As a teacher, I am constantly searching for something to captivate the curiosity and imagination of my students.  This DVD uses the forensics of 'CSI"" and the biblical foundations of Moses to capture the attention of even middle schoolers. Even my own seven year old loved watching it with me!  A very well done production of events, biblical lore and criminology.",1214006400,4,364,4.950819672131147
8045234,1,B00076QKLU,"This movie was about twice as long as it had to be, with many comments being repeated at the peril of the viewer (perhaps an inept attempt at dramatic effect?).  At first glance and during some of the time while watching it, we were intrigued by the science, archaelogy, and inquiry into the facts of the Bible.  Unfortunately, it became apparent pretty quick that there were a lot of ""ifs"", ""maybes"", and unsupported hypothesis stacked on top of each other to reach and unequivical, ""We're not really sure.""

The danger in this film is, to someone who is not paying close attention, it seems as if they were able to ""disprove"" the Exodus story.  The only reason we would recommend a Christian watch it, is so they can be ready to point out it's flaws to someone who takes the presentation as fact.",1208044800,,798,4.559440559440559
8045235,1,B00076QKLU,"So Bad... Bad science, bad video and waste of money. The same meaningless information over and over.  How could they make this big a mess?  Wish I had read the other reviews before I paid the twenty bucks.  Not even decent filming.... pushed a very weak point way beyond the wall.  What that other guy was doing in the film - don't know.. perhaps looking for work and still is.",1165708800,2,377,4.3428571428571425
8045236,1,B00076QKLU,"One has to rate this work with the worst possible ranking, because its main claim that the Exodus didn't happen as tradition states is supported without a foundation.  Honest reporting and scientific research should reveal ALL the facts to the audience.

However, full disclosure was not done and I feel this was done on purpose.  The viewer is not made aware that nowhere in the story of Exodus, Torah, or any Jewish text does it say that Ramses was the Pharaoh of the Exodus.  In fact, the story of the Exodus only mentions Ramses as a location!

Plus, Jewish texts put the Exodus at a much earlier time period in Egyptian history and this is backed up by Archaeological evidence.

If anything, this documentary proves Ramses wasn't the Pharaoh of the Exodus, which supports the Torah timeline.

The fundamental premise is wrong.  One would hope that if an ""expert"" is going to attempt to debunk a text that ""expert"" should at least be somewhat familiar with it.

I've recently attended a lecture given by archaeological researcher, James D. Long.  James is a dynamic speaker and his book, ""Riddle Of The Exodus"" is even more fascinating.  ""Scientific method"" and sound reasoning are utilized to prove when the Exodus really happened and that the Torah, as well as other ancient Jewish texts provide an accurate account of history.  James takes archaeologists in what's known as the ""minimalist"" camp to task for their lack of biblical knowledge and their frequent attempts to withhold information in attempts to bolster their theories, or help spin their political views.",1151712000,5,1574,4.942965779467681
8045237,1,B00076QKLU,"I find that many of the videos claiming to be ""documentaries"" have an agenda.  Sadly, many people see them as factual.  Teachers need to be extremely careful when they select films for their students.",1151020800,4,200,4.852941176470588
8045238,2,B00076QKLU,"Kent Weeks, rediscoverer of KV5, found three partial human remains in a pit in that tomb.  He speculates that one of these (one in particular) is the remains of Amonherkhopshef (Amonherwenemef), firstborn son of Ramses II.  Like a lot of people, Weeks saddles on to the mistaken claim that Ramses II ""the Great"" was the pharaoh of the Exodus.  The rest of the video then treats both identifications as factual, then uses those straw men arguments to prove that the Exodus didn't happen.

For example, the skull is that of a grown man, not a child, so despite the fact that no one will ever know the identity of the remains, the words in the narration are, ""the Biblical tradition must be wrong.""  This is unforgivably shoddy, silly, and stupid.

Even more grandiose are the video's claims to show that none of the details of the Exodus, from the identity and age of Moses, through the Plagues, the fountainhead of monotheism, the nature of the escape, all the way through the actual cause of death of the pharaoh, are false.

Since 18th dynasty Hatshepsut's bas relief of her voyage to Punt names the port official who greeted her there, and it matches that of a Solomonic-era port official in charge at Ezion Geber, and since the Amarna archive of the 18th dynasty contains names right out of the Old Testament from the time of the early monarchy of the House of David, Akhenaten must have lived centuries after Moses, and could not have been the source of Moses' monotheism.

And more obviously, the 19th dynasty was not the time of the Exodus.

The video is well put together otherwise.  Morgan Freeman's narration is pretty cool.  I give the product a mere two stars because the script and the premise isn't worth a you know what.  If this is what it takes to keep Kent Weeks excavating KV5 for the rest of his life, close the excavation right now.",1150675200,12,1852,4.612804878048781
