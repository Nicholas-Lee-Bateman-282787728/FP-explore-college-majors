8247933,3,B0012VCMUC,I give it three stars based on value.  You get a lot of film however if you are hoping somehow the quality hasn't been compromised you will be disappointed.  You may spend 73 straining to hear the dialogue.  The seller also requires a signature upon delivery which they do not tell you and seems ridiculous since the delivery window is about three weeks with no tracki,1455494400,,368,4.545454545454546
