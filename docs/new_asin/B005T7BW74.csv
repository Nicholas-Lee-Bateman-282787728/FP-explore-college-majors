4888342,5,B005T7BW74,"Season 6 of Rugrats is the first one to star Dil Pickles, since it takes place after the first movie, but it sadly became the final season produced in glorious Traditional-cel-animation. The final 28 shows produced that way are in this set, as 5 earlier chunks of episodes are in season 5's set, and all 3 parts of the TV movie Acorn Nuts and Diapey Butts (The first episodes made in Digital ink-and-paint technology) are in season 7's set. The 6th season truly had 36 shows altogether. Even so, you still get a ton of 'sploring in the biggest Rugrats season of them all; such as Chuckie and Lil getting ""married"" with Dil as their baby, the Rugrats celebrating Valentine's Day (and trying to get Spike and Fluffy together), Tommy, Dil and Chuckie in the ""old country"" where Boris and Minka live, a crossover ghost story featuring the cast of AAAHH!!! Real Monsters (especially Krumm, Oblina, and Ickis!), the babies showing Dil what music's like by singing their own takes on a few classic songs (plus Didi singing Beautiful Dreamer to him at the end), Chuckie getting his own bachelor pad, the Rugrats in their own ""prom picture"", Angelica in a no-talking contest so's her parents can buy her new Cynthia toys, the babies imitating Noah's Ark, and their daddies imitating them, the first-ever Rugrats TV movie (Runaway Reptar) as an unedited 2-parter, Tommy and Phil running for mayor, Grandpa Lou in a wrestling match against the McNulty brothers' grandpa, Tommy and Chuckie meeting Samantha and Freddie (no affiliation with iCarly!); respectively a bigger daredevil than Tommy and a bigger scaredy-cat than Chuckie ever were, Susie baking obviously-yucky cereal bars that actually do good for Stu's inventing good doorstoppers, Angelica on a crime spree with Dil as her partner, Susie in a Wizard-of-Oz-type dream during her tonsillectomy, the babies ""discovering America"", and meeting Barney-the-dinosaur-like Goober the Gopher (played by future Digimon AND CGI-Garfield actor Wally Wingert), and lots more! If you've noticed watching this set, Susie and her family appear more often than before, starting with this season, and that's a good thing, especially for the African-American people who're watching it! This is also the first season to conclude with the famous ""robotic"" Klasky Csupo end logo, AND the last one to have the old one from the first 5 seasons; the robotic one was first used (to my knowledge) in the first Wacky Adventure of Ronald McDonald (Scared Silly) in October 1998, and said logo was slightly revised and sped-up for The Rugrats Movie just 1 month later. It was somewhere in this season that it was proven Lil was born before Phil, thus her pictures are on this set, and Phil's on season 7. Also during this season, when it was new on Nick, technology was heard of or used from the late 90's that were never perfected in the early 90's, such as the Internet, HDTVs and DVDs (It seems uncertain when the original Rugrats series actually took place); as well as the fact that SpongeBob AND Digimon made their big debut during this season (in the case of the latter future-Nicktoon, it originally aired on Fox and Fox/ABC Family)! In one episode of Rugrats' 6th season, you'll also hear a catchy Cynthia Workout song sung by Tommy Pickles' own actress, E.G. Daily! On top of voicing Tommy and Buttercup, she was also a popular singer, but not as popular as the bands of the 90's or today, but she's still a popular singer and actress. No glitches to speak of in my set, and thank ""Bob"" for that; most of the season sets don't have closed-captioning or disc subtitles, as you might've learnt already. If you're wanting to own the whole original Rugrats series, and haven't yet, go ahead and add this landmark monster to your collection; like season 3 is, season 6 is also a 6-disc set contained in 1 normal-sized DVD case!",1406246400,4,3852,4.855623100303951
4888343,2,B005T7BW74,"I was surely not expecting what I got. This has always been one of my favorite shows and as this was the only place I could find it, I ordered it. Now, I was begrudgingly willing to pay the price because again, this was the only place I could find the seasons. However, I was extremely upset upon opening my package when it arrived. Upon opening the DVD's I found they were nothing more than simple burned copies with a picture sort of nicely placed on front, but clear mock ups, what could be made in someones home. As if that wasn't disappointing enough, receiving what I thought were 'legit' DVD's, instead arrived in a cheap case, it was honestly just cheap all around, not at all fitting of the $40 price tag. If that isn't upsetting enough, the DVD's themselves, were filthy, covered in smudges and fingerprints, and even a couple scratches from what looked like what was clearly someone carelessly putting in the case, and obviously having some difficulties, it was reckless. Finally, while the DVD's actually play, and do not skip, the quality is somewhat decent, at best. I have a nice tv, and it shows up a little, grainy.. verticle lines through the picture, and just looks like a cheap copy; what you would get if you downloaded something on to your computer and then burned it on to a disc. All in all, I have watched them a bit, but I would not order more from them of this, at least not for even half of the price I paid, and that they are still selling at. Also, I am now a much more weary amazon buyer, and have been avoiding it for most other purchases. It would have been one thing if amazon was up front about exactly what type of DVD's you were getting, and had a fairer price to match, not too mention, how hard is it to nicely put away a DVD without getting it covered in fingerprints and scuffs, and scratches.",1393286400,7,1834,4.381231671554252
4888344,4,B005T7BW74,Purchased all of the seasons to have the complete set....loved this Nick-toon when it first aired and wanted them for my home collection. Only gave it 4 stars because it is not closed captioned.,1387670400,,194,4.735294117647059
4888345,5,B005T7BW74,i love having this available to watch any time i want and i love that its the entire season not a partial,1387324800,,105,3.8181818181818183
4888346,3,B005T7BW74,"These are mostly shorts. They need to be doubled to count as an episode as far as room on a dvd goes. On normal manufactured dvd's(not including Millcreek which puts 10 episodes per disc) there are up to 8 (22 min.) episodes per disc. Now looking at the first disc: it has 5 episodes (10 shorts), 2nd disc: it has 5 episodes (10 shorts), 3rd disc: it has 4 episodes ( 1 double-length and 6 shorts), 4th disc: it has 5 episodes (10 shorts),
5th disc: it has 5 episodes (10 shorts), 6th disc: it has 2 1/2 episodes ( 2 double-length and a short) that totals 26 1/2 episodes. Now 4 discs would hold 32 double-length worth of episodes if you put 8 episodes(16 shorts)per disc, mix and matching. No more than 4 discs would have been needed. I don't like playing the discs and then keep having to change the discs real fast. I truly believe they did this to jack up the price. I can't see any other reason to have so many discs
when these are mostly shorts. The other thing that took off a star is that this is a MOD release. That all the Rugrats seasons were MOD releases. They jack up the prices for MOD releases too with isn't fair to the consumers. I wish they would bring out all the Rugrat Seasons out on regular
releases. Even though I wish this had less discs it is 50% off so I bought it anyways. I haven't watched it yet. I will add to my review once I have watched it.",1382832000,,1373,4.146067415730337

4888353,5,B005T7BW74,"Bought this two days ago along with Seasons 3, 4, 5 and 7, haven't received it yet, but I've seen many episodes from this season and I must say that I'm really happy with the episodes I'll be owning on DVD. This season/DVD contains the one-hour special ""Runaway Reptar"". I LOVE the Reptar episodes. What this particular set DOESN'T contain that is from this season, is the hour-and-a-half special ""Acorn Nuts & Diapey Butts"". It is on the Season 7 set for some reason. Also, just in case you're interested in facts, this season is the first season to use the famous robot Klasky-Csupo logo and is the last season to use the original theme song. Suzie starts to have a bigger part starting in this season. This season also marks Dil's first appearance in the series. I can't wait to get more seasons of my favorite '90s cartoon!",1460937600,,827,4.557046979865772

4888357,5,B005T7BW74,"I received this season as an Easter present, and, once again, another excellent season of Rugrats! Like my subject line says, it's Baby Dil, all the way! This entire season focuses around the Rugrats, now with a new member to the gang, Tommy's younger brother Dil. We see everything happen, from going through a bakery to find Tommy and Dil's mom's birthday present, to worrying they're turning into the animals at the petting zoo, to learning about music, and performing their own versions of classic songs, to Chuckie getting his first bachelor pad, to their first trip to the drive in movie, not to mention, the first hour long special, originally released as a direct to video release on the cassette, Runaway Reptar back in 1999, as well as a few other episodes that were direct to video releases way back in the day, including Dil We Meet Again and Big Babies, originally released on the Make Room for Dil video, and we celebrate some more holidays, like Valentine's Day in Be My Valentine, Parts 1 and 2, one of the episodes, as well as Dr. Susie, which both made it as top 10 episodes of Rugrats within the first decade of its existence, are available on this season, as well as The Fourth of July is celebrated, in the episode, Discover America, another one that I believe was a direct to video release back in 2000, on the Rugrats Discover America video. Other good episodes on here feature such things as Tommy and Phil running for mayor, Chuckie taking up being a safety officer, grandpa Lou putting on his tights and wrestling in the ring, and much, much more! It's definitely a season one must have for their collection, if they're a Rugrat fan, and enjoy the adventures of the gang with baby Dil, prior to their trip to Paris, but after their first full length film, where Dil was born. So raise your baby bottles, and crawl baldly where no baby's ever crawled before, with season 6 of Rugrats, trust me, from a true Rugrat fan, who recalls watching this season quite well when it originally premiered way back in the day on Snick, with a few video releases between 1999 and 2000, you won't regret it! And if you're an old fan like myself, it's sure to bring back a lot of memories!",1428192000,,2197,4.55050505050505
