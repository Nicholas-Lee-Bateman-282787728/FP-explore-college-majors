3895158,5,B002BO2RWW,"I love Barry's music but I was kind of hesitant to buy this DVD based on some of the reviews. But the price was so low I figured there's not much to lose here. And I was right! The video quality could be better but there really isn't much content out there on DVD when it comes to Barry White so I can deal with this minor flaw. The audio is not of the greatest quality either. However, it's not terrible. If you have a decent receiver and speaker setup it sounds just fine. The concert itself is good. Barry's voice is in top form and he gives 100% as he usually did. Just to let you know, there are a few tracks on this DVD that were taken from the older Germany concert with Love Unlimited. The main menu on the DVD is also in Spanish. I don't know why? But that isn't a concern for me. Overall, I really enjoyed the DVD and have no regrets buying it. If your a fan of The Maestro then I think you'll really like this DVD. Especially since there aren't many others of Barry out there. You would think there would be more concerts of Barry out there when you think about the amount of shows he has done during his career?  However, I'm thankful and grateful to have what little there is of him out there. Although he couldn't read or write a single note of music, Barry White was a musical genius in his own right and I truly feel he never got the recognition he rightfully deserves. However, his music is timeless and will live on and on for generations to come!",1360972800,7,1465,4.158450704225352
3895159,5,B002BO2RWW,"This is the mistro at his best. You will love the lush rich sounds of this musical genious.  What a voice, what a feel for music!",1346716800,2,129,3.9615384615384617
3895160,3,B002BO2RWW,"When I saw the add for selling this DVD it looked very nice. but the strange thing is that this is a very cheap copy and quality, everything is in English except the menu, so for me seems to be a copy from another copy edited. Eventhough it came as new packed the content looks very cheap quality. I was expecting more professional quality.
I guess I am Ok for the price...but it would be nice a better quality description. Not happy!! I would recommend to watch this DVD before you intent to buy or sell it.
Your service was very fast and I do appreciate it, but the result is the most important in the equation. No good product quality at all.
i will find a better copy to buy.",1312329600,13,679,4.190839694656488
3895161,1,B002BO2RWW,"I have searched for a decent Barry White cancert forever!  The Germany Concert is a joke. So, this recently available concert is interesting.  It would be more interesting if the sellers thought enough to at least list the song performances on this DVD...might make it a little more marketable.  I collect music including DVDs, but I for one don't buy products without information about the contents...its risky...especially imports.",1299196800,34,433,5.338235294117647
3895162,4,B002BO2RWW,"Should have purchased more than one.  It took me forever to find a Barry White dvd.  Finally found one and would love to give more for Christmas gifts, but now all I get is ""unavailable"".  The quality may not be the greatest, but afer all, it is BARRY WHITE!!",1291075200,2,259,4.244897959183674
3895163,5,B002BO2RWW,"Barry White is one of the great singers, songwriters, composers in the history of R&B/Soul/disco-dance music. This concert proves that! The voice is pure, and having Love Unlimited singing their hits during his breaks is great because their harmonies are great! I laugh when I see reviews that talk about audio or visual problems, or the singer not sounding as good as the recordings. All of our musical icons (Barry White, Luther Vandross, Marvin Gaye, Jeffrey Osborne, Areatha Franklyn, Chaka Khan, just to name a few)changed the face of music with their voices, writing & performing! I'd take any old school R&B singer/group over 99% of the garbage that is on the airwaves now! Be thankful that you can own a piece of musical history. Barry performed all of the hits, the band was tight, and I partied to this dvd.",1290124800,30,817,4.801418439716312

3895178,1,B002BO2RWW,"The O'Jays were great as usual, however, Barry White was just segments of songs.  I watched it for several minutes and cut it off, have not touched it since.  If something good was on it, I may never find out.  Pretty cover, however, I may never order another Berry White again.",1377561600,,278,4.411764705882353
3895179,1,B002BO2RWW,"I so wish I could say all good things about this DVD because I absolutely loved Barry White's singing. How ever I have purchased this DVD twice and had to send it back both times. When I put it in both of my DVD players it starts this loud vibrating noise and won't play even one song. I really wanted to add a DVD with Barry performing to my DVD collection. We have lost so many of the artist who really moved us with their music. And we're losing more all the time. Soon there won't be any of the greats left. I appreciate that someone is capturing these important performances on DVD, but please make them worth us spending our money.",1376870400,7,637,4.229508196721311
