7923850,5,B00004UD5G,"I'm a music teacher at a specialized school for the arts (elementary age children). We are currently working on a project centered around Mussorgsky's ""Pictures"". The art  and english teachers and I decided to work together on this and combine music, visual arts and creative writing into one big ""event"" - all based on the music. It was difficult helping the kids get a grasp on what this music was really about. The surviving paintings of Victor Hartmann do not do much for a young kid (or for an adult). This video was a tremendously helpful resource for us. The video footage from around Europe really helps paint a vivid picture for each of these pieces. All of my classes sat attentively through the film and really enjoyed it. It's such a good way to tie in music, art, history - all that good stuff! If you are a serious musician looking to actually see the orchestra, this film is not for you as the instruments are never seen. Its very worthwhile, though, and I intend to purchase more from this series.",1202256000,,1013,4.565934065934066

I really hate to contradict a top 50 reviewer, but this disc is mediocre at best.  Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition was one of my favorite pieces.  Now that I've seen and heard this DVD, I'm not so sure.  The video is a juxtaposition of uninteresting live footage.  My recommendation is to close your eyes or read a book, just don't watch the footage.
OK.  So your eyes are closed now you can enjoy the music, hopefully, you can.  I have no problem with the performance or the CD quality sound, but the 5.1 encoding certainly does not bring this recording to life.  Truly, this DVD was another Naxos disappointment.
The birth of my son will keep my wife and I away from the symphony for a few years.  I am certain that my growing library of symphony performances will scratch my musical itch.  My recommendation to you is to find a Sony, Image Entertainment or Pioneer Entertainment offering and enjoy all aspects of your DVD purchase. These offerings are much better than the Naxos disappointments.  Karajan, anyone?  Bravo!
Thanks for your time and enjoy the music.

7923852,5,B00004UD5G,"Two more entries in the generally excellent series called ""A Naxos  Musical Journey"" have come my way as companion volumes:  Rimsky-Korsakov's <Scheherazade> with the ""Sadko"" tone poem  as a bonus (DVDI 1001)--a very appropriate number!--and Mussorgsky's  <Pictures at an Exhibition> with Borodin's ""In the Steppes of  Central Asia"" and ""Polovtsian Dances"" as extras (DVDI  0999).
  The ""Pictures"" sequence is the first in this series  to deal with program music and the editing has the video in splendid synch  with the music. In the Ox-cart segment, we see a slow moving train and the  majesty of the ""Great Gate of Kiev"" is lessened a bit when a  Russian guard lights a cigarette. But we are in a museum during the  Promenade segments, while the ""Samuel Goldenberg and Schmuyle"" is  imaginatively presented by showing a rabbi in a rich synagogue juxtaposed  with one in a ruined building. Wonderfully done.
  ""Steppes""  is accompanied by more or less appropriate visual images, but the Dances  provide a background to too mundane shots of city folk doing anything but  dancing.
  The ""Scherazade"" DVD is just fine as long as it  sticks to the magnificently decorated buildings of the Moslem cities chosen  for these sequences. Again, however, it is the shots of people leaning  against buildings, of a camel drooling in close up, of sheep trying to  drink from a single trough--that lessen the majesty of the music and seem  inappropriate. And to boot, some of the sequences are repeated from the  earlier DVD, which can be annoying. The ""bonus"" of the  ""Sadko,"" however, is most appropriately accompanied by brooding  shots of Lake Komarovo.
  The music itself is drawn from the bottomless  Naxos catalogue and is quite respectably played. Both sets run at about 57  minutes.",968803200,,1779,5.041522491349481
