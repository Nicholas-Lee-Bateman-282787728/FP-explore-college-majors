3916576,5,B002EAYE1U,"One of my favorite ""guilty pleasure"" movies.  It's not clever, it's not doing anything a hundred movies haven't done, but it has charm.  It's a great showcase for McNichol.  If you love romantic underdog 80's movies, this one will scratch your nostalgic itch.",1423180800,,259,4.976744186046512

3916578,5,B002EAYE1U,"Kristy is such a great, natural actress. She's witty & smart. I always love her work!

3916579,5,B002EAYE1U,"Love this and I am watching it at this very moment.. Received today and couldn't wait to watch it.  It is funny, romantic, touching  and the scenery is awesome. Love Michael Ontkean and Andre Dussollier. in fact Andre starred in one of the first movies  made
of 3 men and a baby.  I have been trying to find it and buy it also as well as the Bourne Identity with Richard Chamberlain.. Love old movies...",1412121600,,403,4.333333333333333
3916580,4,B002EAYE1U,"I saw this movie years ago when I was just out of college. It is a fun movie, seems now like it is more for younger people but I enjoy watching it never the less.
I don't want to give away the story line, but it is basically about a young woman musician who wants to find the right man, but is fearful she will not be accepted due to her physical limitations which developed after she contracted polio.
She finds a clever way to disguise her disability and gets the guy in the end!",1409788800,,481,4.073684210526316
3916581,5,B002EAYE1U,"Entertaining, humorous and excellent acting by Kristy McNichol.",1406592000,,63,7.0
3916582,5,B002EAYE1U,"I always liked Kristy McNichol, there's something about her.  This 80's movie was one I always enjoyed seeing on cable.  It's a little dated but still cute and I was thrilled to see it again.",1405296000,,191,4.428571428571429
3916583,4,B002EAYE1U,I hadn't seen this hidden gem of a movie in many years so I was pleasantly surprised to find a DVD version on Amazon. It stars Kristy Mc Nichol as a concert flute player who had a foot deformity that requires her to wear a metal brace on her leg. She gets booked on a concert tour in Europe and while there she gets the idea to have a doctor put a cast on leg so she can go to a ski resort in France and pretend she had a ski accident. She meets all kinds of interesting people and is fully accepted. She has a great time and falls for a international photographer. It is a terrific movie and you never find out what will happen as movie ends and leaves you to speculate as to whether they get together permanently. I  liked it very much.,1404691200,,738,4.020408163265306
3916584,5,B002EAYE1U,"This is one of those movies that is worth watching even if you don't care about the actors- it's that good.
But for her fans, this is one of Kristy McNichol's finest movies. Plausible, funny, romantic. The video and sound quality of the DVD was good. Her supporting cast was excellent as well, except for her fiancee, who came across as rather stiff (the actor, not the character) and stilted.",1397520000,3,393,4.628571428571429
3916585,4,B002EAYE1U,She was one of my favorite actresses when I was kid.  The movie arrived in good condition and I have already watched in a few times.,1396396800,,132,4.076923076923077
3916586,5,B002EAYE1U,its a cute movie about a girl who cant seem to find a boyfriend because she had polio and had a brace. smart girl had a cast put on went on a trip to ski it is as enjoyable to watch as it was years ago,1389225600,,201,3.391304347826087
3916587,4,B002EAYE1U,"I remembered this romantic comedy from the 1980s when I saw it on TV.  My wife recently suffered a knee injury that left her essentially bed(chair)-ridden for 2 months, so she was watching a lot of TV.  As you may know, daytime TV truly sucks.  She is facing the possibility of permanent loss of some function in her leg, so I thought  the old movie might cheer her up and ordered it through Amazon.  It turned out to be much funnier than I had remembered, and cheered my wife and I up immensely. Mc Nichols' character is a poster child for individuals with physical disabilities, and  a role model for how to deal with them in social situations (from before we got so politically correct these days).  I'd forgotten many of the episodes in the movie, and the scene in which her (un-handicapped) friend pretends to be blind, though only a few seconds long, left us in stitches.  I recommend it to anyone, but especially to anyone who may be facing any sort of physical challenges.",1389052800,3,980,4.528409090909091
3916588,3,B002EAYE1U,actually it's a spunky movie and enjoyable and a few tears and I will pass it on to an 19 year old granddaughter.,1381276800,,113,3.9565217391304346
3916589,4,B002EAYE1U,"This movie wasn't a huge hit, but was a cute, fun movie idea with Kristy McNichol and Patrick Cassidy. Kristy McNichol had some health problems while filming this, so it almost didn't get completed, but so glad it did, as a fun movie to watch!",1381190400,,243,4.4222222222222225
3916590,5,B002EAYE1U,I'd forgotten just how much I love it.  Kristy is wonderful.  Everybody does a great job.  BUY IT!  Look at it!  ENJOY!  :D,1377993600,,123,4.130434782608695
3916591,5,B002EAYE1U,I had seen this movie years ago and absolutely loved it. I can identify strongly with the female lead circumstances and felt McNicholes did the role justice. I am a happy camper with my DVD :),1368662400,,192,4.361111111111111
3916592,5,B002EAYE1U,Had this on VHS tape and wanted it on DVD... It was on tv back in the early 90's and has not been on since.. Glad I was able to purchase it and add it to my DVD collection..,1364947200,,173,3.4615384615384617
3916593,5,B002EAYE1U,"I watched this movie as a little girl & I loved It.  I could not find it on DVD anywhere until one day I looked at the movies on here & seen it I was so happy,  I can relate to the story line.  Great movie for the whole family.",1363996800,,227,3.5
3916594,4,B002EAYE1U,"after 15 years of trying to get this in any format, I now have it.
It's just as good as I remember it.

3916595,5,B002EAYE1U,This was a delightful movie that I came upon by chance. I am happy to recommend it to anyone who like to spend an evening in an armchair and watch a happy film with delightful characters.,1362441600,3,187,4.222222222222222
3916596,5,B002EAYE1U,This is a cute movie which depicts a gal with polio who wants to be like anyone else and has a brilliant idea on how to do just that. It is sad that society still has hang ups about people with handicaps!,1362096000,,204,3.880952380952381
3916597,5,B002EAYE1U,I love Kristy in this movie. It's another simple feel good flick about not letting your disabilities get the better of you. Plus I love the setting in which the movie is filmed.,1343088000,,177,4.393939393939394
3916598,5,B002EAYE1U,I have loved this movie since the first time I saw it.  I am glad that I have it in DVD now.,1338854400,,92,3.1818181818181817
3916599,5,B002EAYE1U,"I remember this movie when it hit the theaters,but I never got to watch it until it surfaced on TV many, many years ago.  Thankfully it's shown on cable now and I just saw it again several days ago.

This is a really fun movie.  It's in NO WAY A DRAG to watch.  It's funny, the fashions-- albeit 80's -- are the best from the era with beautiful designer wear and accessories--- the fancy party at the private chalet is a highlight. The scenery is beautiful.

The movie gives us a reminder of how the majority of us look upon those with ""disabilites"" and Kristy's character, Susan, shows us what it's like from her view.  We all have quirks, eccentricities, mental or physical detriments to some degree.

It comes down to treating people the way you would wish to treated.

The cast includes Robert Carradine, Tim Daly--looks exactly the same today, Alexandra Paul--gorgeously snotty; Patrick Cassidy--- a real cutie pie; Michael Onkeaton-- incredibly handsome.",1332115200,2,960,4.810975609756097
3916600,5,B002EAYE1U,"To me, this is a classic. I love to watch it every winter during skiing season. Kristy McNicole does an excellent acting job for her part.",1329177600,,138,4.346153846153846
3916601,5,B002EAYE1U,A story about a girl who has had polio and wears a calliper. She goes to France and sees a picture in the window of a travel agent of people skiing with one of their legs in plaster and decides to get her leg plastered so no one knows about her calliper. She goes on a skiing holiday and falls in love but he doesn't find out about the  calliper until she has the plaster removed and he sees her on the station platform. However  it doesn't matter to him and it all turns out well. An excellant film.,1325980800,,500,4.040404040404041
3916602,5,B002EAYE1U,"This is a TOUGH movie to find on DVD so if you're even remotely inclined to buy it, BUY IT!  It's a cute movie and makes me wonder what good things Kristy MacNichol would've done if she had continued acting!",1310083200,3,207,4.175
3916603,5,B002EAYE1U,"Kristy McNichol is just irreplaceable! I have been a fan of Kristy since I was a kid and she was everywhere on television, films, commercials during the 1970's-90's. I never could get enough of her performances and never grew tired of them either. So with my browsing the website here, I was pleasantly surprised to rediscover this film now on DVD. "" Just The Way You Are"" was constantly played on HBO and loved it then too. Like many fans, I hope that she one day soon will return to gives us all another taste of her talents. Thank you!",1308700800,8,538,4.39
3916604,5,B002EAYE1U,I saw this for the time on Stars/Encore and I loved it! It's a beautiful movie and I am glad that it was available for purchase on Amazon.,1306022400,,138,3.9642857142857144
3916605,5,B002EAYE1U,"I first saw this movie when I was about 11 or 12 and I remembered loving it then and still do. Its hard to find in stores and I am very happy Amazon carried it. Christy McNichol plays a very convincing role as a polio-disabled flutist who on a whim decides to take a ski trip even though she's never done it before. The romantic situation that follows and the closeness between her and her newfound friends is wonderfully done, making you almost ache for a similar getaway. All the while she is hiding her disability under a cast, but bravely enters a ski competition. I won't completely spoil the movie, but I love it. Christy McNichol has a sort of self-conciouss personality much like that of Ralph Machio in Karate Kid, which helps her to come off very real and raw making this one of her best performances of her career. I highly recommend this movie to anyone.",1305331200,2,866,4.452830188679245
3916606,4,B002EAYE1U,"I remember a girl in one of my classes way back when who was forever on crutches.  Kristy McNicol's character reminds me of her, and like Kristy McNicol this girl was very attractive.  In fact, she was more beautiful than the actress.  And, even though she was on crutches (some handicap) she had lots of boyfriends.  Tons.  It just goes to show you that no matter who you are or what condition you're in, if you're a cute girl, guys will go for you.

But, no matter how true that statement this film just assumes we'll buy into the poor little beautiful girl who is suddenly unattractive because she's disabled.  Well, okay (he said smiling). :)

We as audience buy into that anyway, and we follow her adventures and misadventures as she tries to escape her stigma by disguising her handicap.  It works, and again we as the audience think her clever as she regains a social freedom that she's never had before.  She finds love, sex, and all that goes with it.  There's a kind of liberation at work here, and again we accept it.

It's a chick flick, but a delightful one.  Not the best movie around, but solid entertainment.",1298592000,,1124,4.5049504950495045
3916607,4,B002EAYE1U,"This movie is great love love love it, was so excited to get it. The reason for the beware part is not the movie but who you buy from. I used a marketplace seller and did have issues with the dvd. The seller i used had great rating but can only figure that has to do with people who didn't have any problems. Bottom line if you use maketplace seller use one that shows some kind of satifaction policy, and read there return exchange policy. In my case was going to be more hassle to get the problem fixed than it was worth and think that was there idea too. Will say though amazon is a great company and did what they could to try to resolve issue. Amazon is tops in my book and even though they didn't have to made this customer happy. BOTTOM LINE ---- AMAZON IS ALWAY 5 STARS be carefull cause some not ALL marketplace sellers not as good. The one i used and would not recomend has the word OLD as part of there name. To top it off sent me an unpleasant email when i left negative seller feedback. Alot of options who to buy from, even if means paying a few cents more for better cutomer service it is well worth it.",1291420800,2,1118,4.086363636363636
3916608,5,B002EAYE1U,Came within a couple weeks.  This was a classic...loved the movie.  Nothing like a good ending. Would recommend to anyone who loves a loves a fun movie and good happy ending.,1287273600,,174,4.580645161290323
3916609,5,B002EAYE1U,"I loved this movie! Kristy McNichol was great.....I for one miss seeing her on TV and in films (except for ""The Pirate Movie."") In this movie she portrays a flutist named Susan Berlanger. Susan had polio as a child and as a result must wear a leg brace that she feels keeps her from finding the love of her life. Because of this, she decides to settle for all that she thinks that she's worthy of....marrying a male friend of her's who happens to be gay, a marriage of convenience for both.  He can carry on with men without being detected as gay at the company he works for and she can eliminate the pressure from her parents (and society)to be married, plus the added security of being taken care of. Anyway, Susan decides to break her engagement and take a once in a lifetime vacation at a French ski resort where she cleverly learns that she can exchange or disguise her leg brace for a cast and consequently, stop people from feeling sorry for her and staring at her because she has a leg brace. After carrying on numerous flirtations with several different men at the resort, she meets a handsome photographer played by Michael Ontkean and they fall in love but she's afraid that once he learns about her leg brace that he won't love her anymore. The popular Billy Joel tune of the same title will be in your head as you watch this film and, bottom line, who doesn't want to be loved ""Just The Way You Are"".....?  P.S.-The ski resort scenery in the move is beautiful!!!",1260576000,18,1475,4.439114391143911
