3499348,2,B001BTDBFK,"This was one of the few purchases I have made that I regretted. It was overpriced in my opinion for the content. There were actually only (2) shows, and Farkle Family Favorites led me to believe that there would be several Farkle family clips, but there was only one.",1440979200,,267,4.469387755102041

3499362,2,B001BTDBFK,I had forgotten how many political references were part of this show. Not as funny as I remembered. Kind of disappointing.,1388620800,,122,4.857142857142857

3499366,3,B001BTDBFK,"because I bought this DVD early, it will be a Christmas gift. I can only hope it plays well. If not it will be a enormous disappointment to the giftee and an embarassement to me as a gift giver.",1339632000,,194,4.0
3499367,2,B001BTDBFK,I haven't watched this more than once since I got it several months ago. Quality is just so-so but I guess I just don't like the Sock-it-to-Me series that much. If you're hard core Laugh-in fan you'll love it anyway. I probably won't buy more but will have to wait and see. Never say never.,1315008000,,290,4.290909090909091
3499368,3,B001BTDBFK,"Rowan and Martin as funny as ever. Quality of video OK but a lot of money for just two episodes.

3499369,2,B001BTDBFK,"January, 1970: Guest James Garner.
Great nostalgia for fans of the show, as ""Best Of""s do not capture all the best stuff. Unfortunately, these full episodes, feature a ton of silliness, bailed out by the exceptionally talented cast, the interesting staging and costumes, and musical sequences (some quite sensual). Garner does not have a single funny line or bit, but his fans will still enjoy watching him work around the unfunny nonsense.
Arte Johnson and Lily Tomlin are really the only consistently amusing players, especially Lily, who we must assume got to inject some original material. Some good bits from ""The Party"" and Dan Rowan as ""General Bull Wright"".

October, 1970: Guest Orson Welles (cameo by Rod Serling).
Almost humourless Halloween Show. Alot of creative costuming and production numbers, but just a few mildly funny lines. Welles is very low-key, as if he's trying to disassociate himself with all the weak material. Fun to note new cast members, Barbara Sharma, Ann Elder, Nancy Phillips, all doing well in challenging conditions. Vincent Price pops in and out - more engaged than Orson Welles.",1266537600,,1117,5.137362637362638
3499370,3,B001BTDBFK,"Episode 1 from November, 1968 with Guest, Victor Borge: as usual, occasionally witty lampooning of the ""establishment|, i.e., the Post Office, etc.; more often painfully unfunny stuff which survives through the abilities of the talented cast to react; the ""News"", however, is interesting (""very"") as it surely anticipated the ""infotainment"" industry coming up a decade or so later. ""The Party"" delivers a couple of chuckles, more a showcase for some sensual dancing from the likes of Judy Carne and Goldie Hawn.

Episode 2 from February, 1969 with Tony Curtis and Laurence Harvey. First half much funnier than the companion show, though it falls like the proverbial piano from the ninth. Tony Curtis does some pointed mugging - but a sketch with Dick Martin, something about an interior decorator approaching a Military man about redecorating barracks, is so badly done, so drawn out, it actually commands the attention of the viewer - can this thing get any worse? Judy Carne, Goldie Hawn, and Chelsea Brown have some cute cutaways as Playboy Bunnies who have to deal with unusual occupational hazards; some very sexy stuff as expected. Ironic, that the most consistently humourous part comes from viewer's letters, containing original jokes.

(Some awkward racial business in this package, though good-natured, and ultimately an intelligent spoof of stereotyping).",1265328000,,1366,5.348837209302325
3499371,4,B001BTDBFK,"Disc One: 1968 episode with Guests Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Jack Benny, Rock Hudson. A Christmas Show, of sorts. Occasionally funny. As usual, alot of elaborate production for very small payoff, in too many spots, though when it does hit, it hits hard, and the very talented players shine; best satire is on the Toy Manufacturing industry.
Disc Two: 1970 episode with Dan Blocker and many new cast members, including Lily Tomlin.
By this season, the writing has improved, the political commentary much keener.
Judy Carne fans will lament that she got less and less air time, at this point. It wasn't fair to include her in the opening credits, when she had approximately five seconds on camera, in this edpisode, and most likely, other ones.
George Shlatter managed to present a kind of send up of the typical variety show; in fact, a send up of the whole entertainment scene. The old-timers still came on the show, sometimes looking confused. (Though, to be frank, much of the material was quite lame).
Fans of the original telecasts will love to watch these episodes again, and a major selling-point is that they are not edited down to half-hour packages, or part of a documentary.
Passable to good video-audio quality.",1265155200,,1220,4.898550724637682
3499372,1,B001BTDBFK,"This disc contained two episodes of Laugh-In, only one of which contained a Farkle Family sketch.  It was an early sketch and did not have all of the family members that appeared in later episodes of the show.  If I could give this disc a zero I would.  The entire disc is mildly entertaining but I know of at least three Farkle sketches that are far better than the ONE included on this pitiful non-collection.  I will not buy any of the other advertised Sock-it-to-me Collections.",1256515200,,482,4.569767441860465
