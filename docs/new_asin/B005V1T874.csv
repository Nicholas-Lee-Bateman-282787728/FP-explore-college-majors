8487243,5,B005V1T874,"Katy Bowman is so innovative at creating the best release for tight occipital and rhomboid muscles! I have been caring for and addressing tightness between the shoulderblades (rhomboids) and at base of head above nape of neck (occipital area) for decades and I have never seen a more effective self-release then this program. Who wouldn't love ""Floor Angels"" any way? I only wish Katy had addressed what position(s) and equipment she recommends for sleeping. She thoroughly addresses movement/sitting positions during your waking hours in this DVD series and I will cover Aligned & Well 113 - From the Shoulders Up
from beginning to end right here:

0:00 - intro to author and series
Katy Bowman, MS describes herself as a BioMechanical Scientist based upon her education in physics, physiology, anatomy, and engineering and describes this DVD series as an Owner's Manual (for the human body). ""Because most of us have similar habits of excessive sitting and have received the same cultural guidelines on how to move, we seem to share the same ailments: degenerated spines, osteoarthritic hips and knees, low bone density, and tension in neck, jaw and eyes. Although we associate these conditions with aging, they are not found in all humans but in those of use who belong to a culture where we sit the bulk of the day, live in almost constant stress, and those of us who have replaced all-day movement with intense bouts of exercise. There is a community of people who are realizing better health through better mechanics which simply means they are learning movements the human body requires in order to stay living disease and injury free.""

2:09 - intro to specific DVD topic - From the Shoulders Up
For headaches, neck tension, foggy brain, eye tension, eye strain, shoulder tendonitis and excessive computer work can be caused or worsened by two cervical issues. 1) ""Forward head ""can excessively wear the disks between the cervical vertebra and decrease circulation to the head/brain. 2) Breathing by elevating the entire shoulder girdle instead of with your ribcage.

All exercises seem to be to work your way up to 60 seconds three time per day.

3:07 First From The Shoulders Up Exercise: Floor Angels using a bolster, stack of pillow or sleeping bag
""Before we get to the smaller muscles of the neck, we have to increase the mobility of the larger muscles that pull incorrectly on the cervical spine.""
Lie down on the floor with your knees bent with the bottom of the bolster supporting right between your shoulderblades. Relax all the way back and let your arms open, palms up. Let your lower back and abdomen lower to the floor taking a couple of deep breaths. Keeping your wrists on/near the floor, make angels going slowly paying attention not to miss any area that doesn't have good range of motion.

7:17 Second From the Shoulders Up Exercise: Crescent Stretch
""A tight neck is directly affected by the tension in the waist, ribs, and shoulders - increasing the circulation here will allow your breathing to come from the ribs, and not from tensing the neck!""
Recline on the floor on your back stretching your hands over your head away from your legs as far as you can keeping your arms and legs as straight as you can while having wrists as close to the floor as you can and toes just pointing up. Keeping your hands and legs on the floor, inch them over to the right into a c shape. When you have gone as far as you can go, take your left ankle and lift it up over the right feeling a stretch through your side. Grab your left wrist with your right hand and pull gently to the right. Relax into this stretch. Increase stretch more if you want by uncrossing ankles, inching your feet over more and then crossing left ankle over right again. Make sure both butt cheeks remain on floor. To come out, uncross ankles and inch back to neutral position. Repeat on other side.

12:35 Third From the Shoulders Up Exercise: Rhomboid Push Ups
""When the muscles between the shoulder blades are working correctly, the neck is held in place with ease.""
Move to hands and knees and make sure your shoulders and hips are aligned and your head and back are relaxed. Let chest drop to floor by shoulder blades moving together without elbows bending. Repeat exercise with your elbows rotated back towards knees rather than out to sides.
16:16 Fourth From the Shoulders Ups Exercise: Head Hang
""Our necks have gotten so tight, we can no longer move our neck joints in the way they were designed. This head hang can gently increase the range of motion of the head and neck.""
Often we try to correct any curvature in our back by lifting up our heads thereby compressing the tissues on the back of the neck. So the area between your shoulders and head is much smaller than it should be. This is a very basic head hanging exercise that restores the length between the skull and the nape of the neck. So start by stacking your body up with your shoulders over your hips and your hips are over your ankles. While keeping your body upright and shoulders relaxed, allow your chin to drop towards the chest.

18:47 Fifth From the Shoulders Up Exercise: Head Ramping
""This is a great exercise to develop into a regular habit - A regular habit of good circulation, good breathing, and little joint damage.""
Slide your ear back until stacked above shoulder. Remember head back, chin down, spine straight.

21:13 Try keeping your face pulled back instead of forward. Elbows should be dropped down and not out to sides. De-stress periodically by taking a few deep breaths also.

22:30 Your Body: The Human Machine: Human Physics 101
The type of movement you do with your body directly impacts how your machine (your body) works. In a healthy body, you have three substances constantly flowing in your body: 1) electricity (communication between your brain and body), 2) blood (your nutrition - what your body cells eat), and 3) lymph (gutter system of your body removing any cellular waste you may have).
""What do your nervous tissue, cardiovascular and immune systems have in common? They all require regular all-over muscle usage in order to stay healthy. If you haven't been moving ALL your muscles, then you are probably having a problem with pain, injury, disease, maybe even accelerated aging

Healthy Muscles are the Key to Your Health
""The more blood flow you have to an area, the more nutrition is received to that area and the more waste that is removed from that area. If waste accumulates in an area, that area tends to swell and becomes more sensitive to pressure. Being sensitive to pressure means that moving the body or even pushing on the skin can hurt and all because you aren't using the muscles in that area.""
Healthy Muscles are the Key to Your Health
1. Using a muscle means your nerves are communicating well with your brain
2. Muscle with electrical flow holds more blood and reduces the work your heart has to do
3. Regularly used muscle cleans itself out more often which means less waste in that area .
Muscle has to be at the correct length in order to get the most electricity which is why it is important that your bones be in a very particular position.

You have about 650 Muscles in your body... How many muscles are YOU using?

Reverse the pattern of degeneration

Hold all body parts in alignment when you move
and
move more often throughout the day

Who taught you to move? Posture and gait pattern is learned, not inherited, and determines degeneration.

In order to be healthy, you have to figure out what you are doing that could be making your health worse and start using muscles that you have neglected for years.

36:38 The Aligned and Well Program will Show You
1.) where your body is right now
2.) where your body should be
3.) The movements you need to do to get back on track
""Attaining health is simple, you just need flow but you can't get electricity and blood coming in and waste going out until you put all of the muscles and bones into the correct position so they can work optimally.""

Re-learning How to Move
""Remember you have been moving one way for years. Give yourself plenty of time to learn your new skills. The more conscious you are throughout the day the easier it will be to identify tasks you do or habits you have that reduce your body's function. Pay careful attention to the introductions and closings of each title; they will give you additional information about how to point your feet straight ahead and not one out to the side, how to stand and save your knees, how to sit at the computer or the dinner table for better all-over function. You will notice changes in your body right away. But be patient with yourself. You are now heading in the right direction. Good luck and be well.""

8487245,5,B005V1T874,"I suffer from thoracic outlet syndrome, a tight neck and TMJD. Probably all related to each other. Consequently, I already have a stack of books and DVDs on the subjects of therapeutic stretching, PT, posture, etc. Despite this, I found a new useful stretch on this DVD as well as a variation on a stretch I already knew. The variation is more comfortable for my body, while still being an effective stretch. The rest of the material was review for me, but having said that, I can vouch for its validity. And a little review never hurts.  :-)

My symptoms have already improved from prior materials and PT by over 80%. But since that's less than 100%, I continue to search and explore. I'm glad I found this video for the reasons above.

If you have problems with your upper back, shoulders, neck or head, I highly recommend that you include this in your recovery and maintenance program. And if you work at a desk for long periods of time, I also recommend that you get this before little problems become big problems.

8487247,5,B005V1T874,"Katy Bowman gives clear, prescriptive, simple exercises. She demonstrates them and explains how they work to improve body mechanics and fix common problems. The production value is excellent - you can see and hear everything without distractions.

I love being guided through stretching routines so I've been in classes and watched many dvd's, but nobody taught me these movements before. From the Shoulders Up isn't like a stretch workout or long choreographed routine, it's more like a series of lessons and demos to take time with and integrate into daily life. The Floor Angel has been particularly helpful to me.

I got this because of my chronic headaches and super-tight shoulder and neck muscles. Watching and doing these exercises is helping significantly and increasing my awareness throughout the day of my posture. The coolest part for me is actually her talk about the body as a machine, and how we aren't given an owner's manual for it. Then she teaches (in simple language)how our machines can function in healthy ways. She's inspiring and helpful in very concrete ways.

She's also smart and awesome and has a cool site and ""Katy Says"" blog, where you can see that's she's funny, too. I will definitely buy and/or rent more of her stuff and follow her on twitter and her site.",1338163200,2,1292,4.91743119266055
