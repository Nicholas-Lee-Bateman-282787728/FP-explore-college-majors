7879058,5,6304853009,"I saw this movie many many times. Faye Wong and Tony Leung shows

groundbreaking performance.

They made such a nice couple here. Amazingly funny.

But they have to work on the subtitles, they can do better.",1166832000,2,207,4.694444444444445
7879059,5,6304853009,"""A Chinese Odyssey: Pandora's Box"" and ""A Chinese Odyssey: Cinderella"" is a two-parts series movie. Together, it is my favorite Chinese movie of all time. It's a modern and humorous twist on the famous Chinese story of ""The Journey West"" (also known as ""The Monkey King""). In the first part, the Monkey King has been reincarnated as Joker, the leader of a group of bandits...

However, I'm confused by the picture that's shown on this listing. That picture is for ""Chinese Odyssey 2002""--clearly a movie NOT made in 1995, with a completely different cast of actors. It stars Tony Leung (a supporting actor in Jet Li's ""Hero"") and singer/actress Fay Wong. It's not the same movie as described here.

Edit: Looks like Amazon has removed the picture I was talking about, so I've taken a bit of time to scan and upload the front and back covers of this DVD.",1150675200,4,853,4.68
7879060,5,6304853009,"It will laugh you to death, and then move you to life (and tears), and then laugh to death again, and again, and again.

No words can do justice to this movie. Sadly, you have to know Chinese (or even Cantonese) to fully appreciate it. This great movie definitely deserves a 6. It is better than Kung Fu Hustler. Strongly recommend it to anyone who knows or is studying Chinese. Buy it, watch it, NOW!",1128902400,3,401,4.346666666666667
7879061,5,6304853009,"It is the best of best among Stephen Chow's movies. (Both Part One and Part Two)

It's not only the slapstick style of humor which is sort of typical in his movies, the conversations in the movie are funny and brilliant too.

Again no English subtitle version can do justice to its full wit and flavor, which, I guess, a Chinese version of Woody Allen's movie would be terrible in this respect too.

Like the effect of some childhood rhyme that everyone remembers, to break the ice among a group of Chinese college students, just recite some words from this movie or sing the ""Only you"" song from it, you can bring the joy that will immediately spread and light up everyone. Guaranteed! It is a cult.",1126742400,2,700,4.496062992125984
7879062,4,6304853009,"I have seen Chinese Odyssey many times, because it is just so funny! Chinese Odyssey is not really a remake of the Chinese classic, Journey to the West, but it is more of a parody, or a side story based on the Monkey King.

Chinese Odyssey is a period drama set in Ancient China. Here, the Monkey King, Sun Wu Kong (Stephen Chow) is reborn (although he doesn't know this yet because he has yet to find a particular person who can ""confirm his identity""), and he's now the leader of a bandit group. Two demons (Spider & ""White-Bones"" Demon) suddenly appear one day and forcefully ""force"" the bandits to do their bidding. And from there, the story moves on to include time-travel, romance, friendship and self-discovery.

There are plenty of twists and turns that are really different from the original story, which is good since it doesn't get boring even if you already know the story of the Monkey King. However, a minus is that you'll need to know the story of the Monkey King to be able to appreciate and laugh at some of the jokes aimed at the original story, but if you don't, there are still plenty of comical parts around to keep you laughing. The funny parts may be rather silly at times, but go ahead and laugh at their silliness. Afterall, Stephen Chow is known to be the King of Comedy. :)

At the end of part 1, you'd probably feel like the ending is too abrupt and somewhat of a cliffhanger, but Chinese Odyssey comes in two parts, so you'll need to watch part 2 as well to be able to fully understand the entire movie. If you are into Chinese mythology and culture, give this a try and take the time to enjoy this show!",1106611200,6,1633,4.382838283828383
7879063,2,6304853009,"Chinese Odyssey, Part 1, is a very wacky period adventure...you'll be forgiven if you end up at the end no wiser than the beginning.  Stephen Chow is Joker, whom two female demons (one, Jingjing, who is in love with him) is convinced is the reincarnation of Sun Wukong, the Monkey God of Chinese classic Journey to the West.  While it must be congratulated for giving the centuries-old classic a novel spin, there's just too much repetition, wackiness and messiness to ensure this a smooth ride; the jokes are mainly slapstick, and could well be removed without hurting the ramshackle plot at all.  Best seen as a preparation to the much superior and emotionally satisfying Part 2, Cinderella.",1106438400,5,693,4.905982905982906
