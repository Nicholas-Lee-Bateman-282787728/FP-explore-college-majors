1964626,2,B0000ZKFM8,"I was very disappointed. Not what I expected at all. Too much in depth reporting about a handful selected subjects. I thought I could use this DVD for some travel information/ideas since I would like to visit Maine this fall, but completely useless. However: if you are looking to learn everything about every single music box in the Musical Wonder House in Wiscasset, or you always wanted to see and hear  about the wildlife artist who uses local basswood to create amazingly detailed sculptures of fish and really wanted to see all of that in full detail, in his own words - then this is the right DVD for you.",1400976000,,612,4.5636363636363635
1964627,4,B0000ZKFM8,"We checked this out at our local library as we are interested in perhaps taking a trip to Jackson Hole, The Grand Tetons, Yellowstone and surrounding areas.  This is not a ""travel video"" like a Rick Steve's might be, it basically showcases in about 49 minutes several areas, some history, a little of the geography and wildlife and some of the artists that live in Wyoming.  We found it really interesting and this really makes us want to look further into planning a trip to see this beautiful state.

Overall, a good video, most especially if you are not familiar with the state and would like to see what it looks like and get a bit of a feel if a trip there might be for you.  They really tried to give you a ""flavor"" of the state and the people and I thing they definitely accomplished that.",1399161600,,796,4.358108108108108

1964632,2,B0000ZKFM8,"The emphasis is on the history of the cattle industry and rodeos and cutting horses. Segments on The Alamo  and Goliad were too short.  Considering the size of Texas, it would take a series of DVDs to cover it historically and geographically.  What was presented was fine - left the viewer wanting more complete coverage.",1388793600,2,321,4.8
1964633,2,B0000ZKFM8,"Parts were interesting, some I couldn't download, Overall it was OK, though I thought it would be more about the people and places than the local industries. I would not watch it again. America is a great and diverse nation, and I was eager to see some of its uniqueness and diversity, however there were not many places covered in this series, not many stories about the diversity, and not even much variety in the state covered. Overall, I was disappointed.",1380412800,,459,4.679012345679013

1964637,5,B0000ZKFM8,"OLD WORLD CHARM..I may not be able to come to America, so i am seeing as much as i can of it by watching DISCOVERIES AMERICA. Have just finished watching LOUISIANA. A state rich in Cultural, Musical and Culinary Traditions, also famous for its Mardi Gras. Traveling along the streets in horse and carriage i looked at the buildings, and then glanced up at the old world charm balconys, built in 1700s. I saw the french quarter, the cafe du monde, and jackson square. Then the town changes at night time, it comes alive with bright lights, and dixi and cajun bands. Then i was off on a boat trip in the Honey Island Swamps. I saw some alligators, and i noticed the swamp trees had no leaves on them, but curled around those bare branches were big snakes. The swamps were so interesting, i saw many species of birds, Herons, Water Fowls, also loverly pink and white birds called Rosette Spoon Bill. then back to the town and taken on to a factory where i watched them makeing TABASCO SAUCE, it is sold to 160 countries around the world. There is much to see in LOUISIANA. Such as colorful street parades, with riders on horseback. And with many street musicans, the people were danceing in the street to their music. It was nice to see elderly couples joining in and waltzing as well. LOUISIANA looks a fun place to be.",1336435200,3,1317,4.468879668049793
1964638,2,B0000ZKFM8,"My husband is a native Minnesotan so I bought this for him as a reminder of the beauty of the state.  Instead, half the program is about industry - taconite mining, ethanol, stained glass (which at least is pretty) - not what I would call a travelogue! I may return it as we will probably never watch it again, and certainly wouldn't recommend it to visitors. We looked at the other videos in the series, but won't be ordering them now!",1329264000,,436,4.382716049382716
1964639,1,B0000ZKFM8,I lead travel tours across the country about 3 times a year and was hoping this might be a nice intro to the beautiful state that is Colorado. It wasn't. They spent an exhorbitant amount of time on a sheep rodeo type event and barely touched on the state's real treasures. Save your money.,1327104000,,289,4.37037037037037

1964642,5,B0000ZKFM8,"""Discoveries America-Colorado"" is a nicely done 50-minute tourist informercial on the State of Colorado.  This DVD doesn't even pretend to scratch the surface of all the things to see and do in Colorado, but it should provide the would-be visitor a good taste of what to expect.

The show opens up with a tour of the Rocky Mountains and especially Rocky Mountain National Park, with its many high mountains and spectacular views.  Next is a visit to Pike's Peak by cog railroad.  Just below Pike's Peak, on the edge of Colorado Springs, is the famous Garden of the Gods, unique rock formations in their own park.  The show takes quick turns through Denver and the outdoor recreation possibilities at Winterpark and Cripple Creek.  The narrative shows down for a fascinating look at the sheep dog championships in Meeker, before moving on to Durango for its Railroad festival.  There is an extended tour, with Park Rangers, through Mesa Verde's ancient cliff dwellings, then it's on to fishing and rafting on the exciting rapids of the Gunnison River.

The voice-over narrative keeps the viewer oriented without drowning out the spectacular scenery, and the show includes comments by locals and visitors.  The effect, hopefully, is motivate folks to consider visiting Colorado.  To that potential audience, this DVD is highly recommended.",1312329600,,1337,5.119815668202765
1964643,3,B0000ZKFM8,"This ""Discoveries...America-Wyoming"" is a quick introduction to some of the wonders of the State of Wyoming.  In a little over 40 minutes, it hopscotches around the state to visit selected points of interest.  An opening segment talks about cowboy movies and women's suffrage, then the narrative plunges into Old West days at Jackson Hole and tours the big National Park at Yellowstone.  The artsy town of Dubois and the Absaroka indian design center get plenty of attention, before the film moves on to brief looks at the hot springs at Thermopolis, the Snowy Range near Laramie, and the merest glance at Cheyenne.  The show concludes with visits to Devil's Tower, a huge coal mine operation, and the Buffalo Bill Museum in Cody.

This survey of Wyoming is very brief and probably uneven in its coverage; on the other hand, if the viewer doesn't know much about Wyoming, this DVD might be a pleasant way to start.  Published in 2003, its information is probably just a little dated.",1310860800,,983,4.8562874251497

1964646,5,B0000ZKFM8,"Whether you reside in Louisiana, have visited, or want to learn more about this fascinating state, this should be part of your collection of memories.  We first borrowed it from our local library and enjoyed it enough to purchase it from Amazon so as to have our own copy.  Very good photography and narrative which even long-time residents of LA will enjoy and learn from.",1274400000,5,373,4.723076923076923
1964647,2,B0000ZKFM8,"If you really know and like Arkansas this will be very disappointing. Arkansas is a beautiful state but you wouldn't know it from seeing this video. They avoid most of the areas of natural beauty and when they do venture slightly into those areas, we notice they filmed this in late winter or early spring when trees are just starting to leaf out, arguably the least attractive time of year in Arkansas.

A few of the topics they cover are interesting but most are just stereotypical small town/hillbilly type stuff that could have been shot in rural Kentucky or Tennesee. If you don't know anything about Arkansas before you watch this, you still won't know anything after you see it.

Production values are amateurish but would have been OK if they had let the state's natural beauty and friendly people speak for themseves.

And it is way overpriced.",1271808000,,853,4.75
1964648,1,B0000ZKFM8,"I would not recommend this DVD. It is basically a commercial for 6 different places in WV. It is divided into 6 sections: Beckley Exhibition Coal Mine, Tamarack (glass making), New River Bridge/Gourge, Dunbar Train ride, and Harpers Ferry. It briefly mentions mothers day in Grafton. And that is it! It left me feeling like there was something wrong with it, that there should be more. I know it was only one hour long but they spent 20 minutes on glass making! I grew up in WV but do not live there any more, but I return every year. I was really excited when I ordered it thinking it would really show off the state. I was going to give it to some friends who were thinking of vacationing there, but now that I have it, I will not even let them know about it. Needless to say I was very disappointed. I think the highlights of the state should include the New River and Harpers Ferry, but what about Charleston, Charles Town, the Greenbriar, Cass Scenic railroad, Canaan (Dolly Sods), Morgantown (Cheat River and Cooper Rock), Droop Mountain, Lewisburg, show off the mountains, etc. They spent so much time on glass making that I forgot it was about WV! I should have figured it wasn't worth it when the information said it was not longer being made. I think any of this state series should give more info so the customer knows what is in it. This series clearly does not do this.",1246060800,4,1382,4.44488188976378

I have a few complaints... a bit long on coverage of Crazy Horse Monument and they skipped the Badlands completely.  Otherwise, it includes lots of little places that mean ""South Dakota"" to the natives.

I purchased a copy for my grandparents who have retired to live down in AZ after living their whole lives in South Dakota (or close by).  I hope it will bring back fond memories.",1209686400,4,575,4.386792452830188
