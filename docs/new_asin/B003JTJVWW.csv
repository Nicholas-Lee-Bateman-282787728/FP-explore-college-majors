4131402,4,B003JTJVWW,Fun 'noir' movie esp. for scenes of Apple Valley & the Salton Sea when it still had water.,1417219200,,90,4.055555555555555

4131404,5,B003JTJVWW,"Saw this movie on Prime and decided to give it a try.  Glad I did.  The plot is somewhat predictable, but the characters interact well and the first few scenes of Old Vegas are great.  Joan Bennett (Father of the Bride) gives an outstanding performance as the uptight fashion photographer.",1393632000,2,289,4.74
4131405,2,B003JTJVWW,"I streamed this for free because it was written by a very young Roger Corman. All I can say is, Roger improved with age! This is a badly put together story that never captured my interest. I didn't know what the accused hoped to ""prove"" by kidnapping and running; he seemed to have no destination or plan and no concept that he was merely adding more locks to his jail cell door. The love that supposedly developed was never explored and seemed nothing but a plot contrivance. The most interesting parts were old Las Vegas, the desert, and the Salton Sea. I knew nothing about the Salton Sea and looked it up. According to Wikipedia, it flooded in 1905. This left me even more confused because apparently Conte's character grew up in a house that was flooded while he was fighting in WW2.",1362355200,,788,4.5174825174825175
4131406,3,B003JTJVWW,"Disclaimer:  I watched this film as a streaming rental, and cannot comment on the quality of the individual disc.  My review has to do with the entertainment value of the film only.

Richard Conte stars as a former marine accused of murder, who then escapes from the police and takes Joan Bennett and Wanda Hendrix hostage as he tries to make a getaway to prove his innocence.  The cops, led by Reed Hadley (radio's original Red Ryder), aren't giving up though, and will go all the way to the shores of the Salton Sea to get their man.  But do Joan and Wanda know more about the murder even than Conte?

Strange to see Richard Conte in any other role than as a mobster, though I think he probably handles this material as well as anyone could have.  It's a pretty sordid story, really, even if it has some positives.  Unfortunately, Mary Beth Hughes isn't one of them.  I've been working my way through her filmography, and I picked this up simply because it was immediately available from a streaming service - but she only appears for about five minutes at the beginning of the film.  Turns out she's the murder victim, a just over-the-hill model cum barfly who's seen with Conte not long before her murder.  Although still an attractive woman, the 1954 version of Ms. Hughes has lost much of the perky freshness from 1948's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inner-Sanctum/dp/B00011D1IG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inner Sanctum</a>.

Wanda Hendrix, as the young hostage of Conte's, possesses much of that charm instead, although the construct of the film has her and Conte ridiculously falling in love after a few minutes.  Other highlights of the film are scenes of the Vegas strip circa 1953, and a look at the LVPD that resembles&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1984/dp/B0039O8AQK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1984</a>&nbsp;more than 1954.  Fascinating cultural differences, I think.

Anyway - stream it for free and you won't feel cheated.  2 1/2 stars, rounded up for Wanda Hendrix in a bathing suit.",1347148800,7,2089,5.342507645259939

4131433,5,B003JTJVWW,"A marine named Jim Henry (Richard Conte) returns from Korea, and meets a woman in a Las Vegas bar. The next day, Henry is picked up by police, and discovers that the woman has been murdered. Now, he's the number one suspect, so, he decides to make a run for it. A dogged detective named Joe White Eagle (Reed Hadley) is on his trail. Henry happens upon a pair of women (Joan Bennett and Wanda Hendrix) having car trouble. After he fixes the car, they head off together. As the three travel on, we find out that Henry's new companions have some secrets of their own. HIGHWAY DRAGNET is a snappy little thriller from 1954. Conte is very good in his man-on-the-run role, as is Hadley. Ms. Bennett and Ms. Hendrix are also well cast. Recommended for the chase film fan...",1439769600,6,767,4.446808510638298

4131438,4,B003JTJVWW,"Agree with most of the other viewers. Richard Conte is always good either as  ""good guy"" framed ( like this and ""Call Northside-777) or hood (too numerous to count). To enjoy the movie you have to put up with a lot of fortuitous coincidences  and depending on  men in thick eyeglasses not  to recognize him from picture on front page. Nevertheless, still  entertaining and the scenes  from Vegas circa early 1950's, desert and the Salton Sea are hard to beat. Not a classic but worth a view",1436313600,,490,4.574712643678161

4131449,4,B003JTJVWW,"I noticed in the credits that Roger Corman had a hand in this one. The opening sequence shot of the Mojave Desert had a real 50's Universal B horror feel to it. I liked Joan Bennett in this  She was funny and wicked. Her diatribe about the FILTHY TRAMP was high comedy. Richard Conte was his usual likeable self, and the always interesting Reed Hadley added to the film.  This whole story, except for the beginning in Las Vegas and the conclusion at the Salton Sea took place on desert highway between the two, and, as a consequence, is a visual feast for lovers of early 50's real steel. The scene of Richard Conte barreling across the desert in a stolen Nash Ambassador black and white (those workhorses of 50s Noirs and Procedurals) is beautiful. Those things could get up and go. As the reader can probably tell, I liked this film",1427760000,4,834,4.480263157894737

4131455,4,B003JTJVWW,"A period piece. The stereotypes are typical if predictable.

The value lies in the 1954 shots of The Apple Valley Inn, the Salton Sea (during a very short and poignant period of it's existence) and the vehicles of the period (check out the trim on the Ford Crestline Sunliner - predecessor to the '55 Fairlane...) Ignore the fact that you see the same Chevy pick-up in three different scenes.

Evidently this was the first screen story Mr. Corman sold . He was credited as associate producer as well . The satisfactory success of the film prompted him to undertake motion pictures as a career .
I watched the film a second time a couple of days ago in order to re-acquaint myself with its particulars . As with the first viewing , I found Conte's performance to be interesting and compelling but too furtive in certain parts . The overall story kept my attention again and the cast did well with the material as written and the constraints of a ten day shooting schedule . There's simply too much coincidence for me to fully surmount in spite of the film's other charms .
