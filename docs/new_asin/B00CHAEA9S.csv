8581767,5,B00CHAEA9S,"""It's about allowing people to face their inner fears to enjoy the darkness within their lives, because if they don't enjoy the darkness, they get afraid of it later on."" So begins Mikhail Tank's documentary ""Psychological Antidotes and Soul Prescriptions,"" which explains the story and origins of Darksoul Theatre. Not being immediately familiar with the subject, I found this documentary very interesting. Mikhail Tank has a storytelling manner, drawing the audience directly into his world and his life.

Growing up in Russia, Mikhail began to develop a desire for dark art at a very young age. ""The darkness is where I find light,"" he explains. After moving to the United States in high school, Mikhail became involved at a drama club. He soon discovered an enjoyment of creative performances, especially in front of an audience. This was the beginnings of what he would grow to call ""Darksoul Theatre.""

Mikhail soon created his first music single, which became a hit on a local radio station. This then developed into performances, more hit singles, and continued recognition. Mikhail won several awards throughout his career, even managing to break a Guinness World Record in 2011 for the longest title of a music single.

Consisting of a combination of dark, soft-spoken music and theatrics, Darksoul Theatre is very performance-driven, often using costumes and masks as props. The documentary shows clips of several of these performances, which is just enough to gain a sense of the style of art that Mikhail displays. There are also plenty of photograph stills, interviews, and monologues; all of which blend together to form the identity of Mikhail, and of his very unique art.

""Psychological Antidotes and Soul Prescriptions"" is an inspiring documentary about the life of Mikhail Tank. A sort of Cinderella story, although perhaps more similar to the Brothers Grimm version than the Disney version, Mikhail never gave up on his dreams, and on his vision. Darksoul Theatre really is about learning to accept the darkness within yourself, and, further, to use it to your advantage so that you can break away from negativity and follow your dreams. For those of you looking for a little boost of inspiration, ""Psychological Antidotes and Soul Prescriptions"" is definitely worth a viewing.",1368144000,2,2298,5.185983827493262

Presented in chronological order, Mikhail starts with his childhood in Russia and the oppression he felt creatively.  Upon moving to America for high school, he immediately took to expressing himself in any way, and anywhere, he was able.  From the lunch room to during class to the stage, Mikhail embraced the freedom his new home allowed.  From there he talks about his college years and collaborations, and even his plans for the future of his art and Darksoul Theatre.

The main theme of Psychological Antidotes and Soul Prescriptions is really positive messages for life.  Mikhail frames this life philosophy in terms of darkness versus negativity.  Mikhail feels the two are opposites, where negativity will bring you down if you embrace the darkness of yourself you know yourself, and can fulfill your creative potential.  He also poses a thoughtful question about the motive for creativity.  The question is whether one is creative to clear their soul, for money, or for the souls in the audience.

Visually, the documentary contains a mix of interview footage, studio footage, original performance footage, and interesting visual effects.  All-in-all it was well assembled and flowed nicely between the different elements.

Psychological Antidotes and Soul Prescriptions is an informative and emotional documentary.  Mikhail talks about struggles and challenges but always manages to see the positives in every situation.
