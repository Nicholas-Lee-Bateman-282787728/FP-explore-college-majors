She doesn't really go over the basic sits, hand positions, or how to hang on to the pole. It's assumed that you know how to do that already and are looking for new moves.

I've been working on pole dance for about a year and a half so I enjoyed these videos.

I have seen Jamilla's The Art of Pole set and I prefer BeSpun's videos. Jamilla teaches you new moves and proper form, but Leigh Ann's videos teach you how to combine moves and do them slowly and sensually. I think it's best if you were to combine both of them though.

I can't wait to start using these!",1364342400,3,739,4.264285714285714

I have purchased many, many pole instructional videos, and Leigh Ann's are by far the most helpful, creative, and thourgh.  Anyone interested in really learning pole work, tricks, and floor work....these videos are for you.  :)",1312070400,,285,4.895833333333333
8406441,4,B003V5Z4PC,"I recently began taking pole dancing lessons at a local studio and I loved it so much, I bought a pole to practice at home. The lessons are expensive and move kind of slow, this DVD set is a great way to learn new moves and save some money on lessons. When I began pole dancing, I was already in good shape (I run and lift weights 3-4 times a week), but decided to try this to improve strength and flexibility. I give it four stars because it is a challenging work out, but it doesn't show that many spins / tricks. However, the instructor is very good, has an amazing, very sexy style and the combos show you how to transition smoothly. Also, it has a warm up, exercise and cool down section so you can easily follow along for a challenging work out. I'd recommend this DVD set if you want to learn transitions and work on your style. If you're interested in learning spins and tricks, I would recommend the Pole Exercise DVDs.",1300406400,3,928,4.278409090909091
8406442,5,B003V5Z4PC,"This set of videos, in my opinion, is the must for everyone interested in pole dancing. There is 5 beautiful combos on each of them, and Leigh Ann is a very gifted dancer and all the moves and combos are artistic, and not merely sporty or seductive. (plenty of Sex appeal bthere too!) and the warm up with stripper push ups and hip circles. I find that first 2 routines on DVD 1 are basic, but number 3 requires more strength and one has to be able to perform a hand stand. DVD 2 is intermediate, again 5 beautiful combos with very clear explanations of each stage, and also demonstrated in slow move mode. DVD 3 is upperintermediate with some advanced moves as well which I perform only half well at this time. But I feel that I will be working with this 3rd DVD for a while to perfect it. I would recommend this product because it is done professionally, it is inspirational, and it allows you to develop as a dancer. I have been pole dancing for a year and a half and I am quite athletic, and this is my favourite set of DVDs (i own about 14 intermediate/advanced ones in total). I am looking forward to any new released from Leigh Ann and BEspun Studios, (which is based in Hollywood).",1290470400,3,1189,4.3125
