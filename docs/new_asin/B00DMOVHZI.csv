5834070,5,B00DMOVHZI,"The British, heists and mobsters. The English make the best movies involving any or all 3 of these components. Nutshell...Lucky, the always terrific, Luke Treadaway, just gets out of jail and his best friend talks him into something not exactly above board and then best friend gets caught and dies and Lucky needs to come up with the money to pay back the mob. I will say no more but great acting jobs by all and you can understand them....YAY. Cars, sex, guns, crazy bad guys, mean people, nice people, girls and just a lot of OMG moments. Sit back and have some fun as Lucky and his brother also terrific take you on an adventure.",1400198400,3,633,4.4655172413793105
5834071,4,B00DMOVHZI,"Guy Ritchie is the King of English gangster films and it looks like Gateway Films is becoming the Crown Prince. GET LUCKY Gateway's latest has one of the best chase scenes I have seen, and in boats on the Thames no less!.The cast all look the part except for Luke Treadaway who looks too young but acts well. Craig Fairbrass and Terry Stone really look like full time thugs espechially Terry Stone who has an evil, nasty looking face and attitude even when he is trying to be funny. He must be related to the Kray twins! however he is a first class actor.  The plot is good but the directon needs to be tightened up. The color could have been better but all in all I give it a four star rating.  I enjoyed every bit of it and it and it's a good film and I would recommend that you see it..",1390262400,4,789,4.116883116883117
