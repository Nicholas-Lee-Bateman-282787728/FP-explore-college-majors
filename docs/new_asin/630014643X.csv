7802933,3,630014643X,"I saw this movie many years ago and remembered it as being very good.  I wanted to see it again and found that it is not being circulated by Netflix, nor any of our local movie rental stores, so I decided to buy it.  It wasn't easily available, but I found a copy in VHS format, through Amazon.com.  The price was a little steep for an old movie, but I promised my husband, who had never before seen the flick, an interesting story.  When we turned the movie on, I was quickly disappointed.  It had an unusual twist but I already knew what it was, and my memory about the overall movie had clearly failed me....the main characters were not fleshed out enough in the story and the whole thing looked so early 70's...not a good thing.  Jaclyn Smith is beautiful and of all the previous Charlie's Angels, she is the only one who can act worth a darned.  But she should have had more of a story to tell...not her fault the script was not as good as it could have been.  Robert Mitchum and James Franciscus did a decent job, but the fault was in the script, not the acting.  And worst of all, my husband guessed who the bad guy was before the movie ended.  Still, it was a good story about a sinking marriage and betrayal.  Because it is so dated by today's standards, I can only give it 3 stars.  This movie could be excellent if it were remade with today's advanced technology, a more fleshed out script, better sex scenes and more dialogue.  Anyone in Hollywood interested?",1358380800,,1471,4.344322344322344
7802934,5,630014643X,"This is supposed to be Jaclyn Smith's first outing from her tv series ""Charlie's Angels"" to the big screen. But the movie wasn't widely released  in the cinema internationally and it premiered on cable tv. However, this is one of the most satisfying thriller you'll ever see.

Smith and co-star James Franciscus have a very strong chemistry on the screen. Proven, in fact, that they also starred in another tvmovie about Jacqueline Kennedy, year after this movie was released.

Veteran actor Robert Mitchum is in his usual ways.  The first half of this film is a bit slow but the last half hour is a nail biter. You can't get past of Jaclyn Smith's beautiful face but this is also one of her best.

The cover of this U.K. dvd version mispelled Jaclyn's name with ""k.""",1127001600,5,767,4.610294117647059
7802935,5,630014643X,"This movie I knew would be great , just reading about it in a magazine on up and coming movies made for televison , I knew it was going to be good when I saw it and to see a all star cast with all the twists , who is doing what to whom , I loved it , they don't make movies like this anymore .

I actually sat through this with my Mom back in 1981 and we were both so engrossed .

I happy to own this tape .

Never forgot it and wish Smith would make more movies again .",1122681600,4,470,3.5
7802936,5,630014643X,"Nightkill is one of those kind of thriller that you don't normally see now a days. Actually, it has a very interesting and original plot that will suck your brain up to the last minute. The first half hour is the so-called ""routine"" check like all other thrillers but the last half hour is a nail biter.
This movie stars Jaclyn Smith, James Franciscus and veteran actor Robert Mitchum.  This is also one of Jaclyn Smith's best performances. I mean, she's gorgeous in every angle, the camera just love her but she's also capable as a performer. Her shower scene is also the high point of this thriller -- see for yourself!
This is a five (5) stars, thumbs up rating!!!!  Cant wait to see a re-make.",1037318400,11,697,4.480314960629921
