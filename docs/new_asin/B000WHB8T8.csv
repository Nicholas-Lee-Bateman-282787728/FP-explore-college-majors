2973565,5,B000WHB8T8,"Needless to say that it was about time to finally get some architects and engineers on the record about their doubts about what happened to the twin towers and Building 7. Richard Gage, AIA, founder of Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth presents damning evidence that the American people have been mislead about what really happened on September 11, 2001.

On this DVD Gage presents evidence that thermite, a incendiary, was used to cut steel beams at the Trade Center. He also explains, in detail, how the official story defies the key laws of physics. In one example for instance Gage explains how physics would not account for the virtually free-fall collapse of all three buildings as it violates Newton's Law of Conservation of Momentum. The prevailing theory by NIST and FEMA is that the buildings fell down because of weakened trusses due to fire causing a ""progressive pancake collapse."" According to Gage this doesn't explain how the buildings could fall at free-fall speed by taking into account this law. Gage: ""through the path of greatest resistance - at free-fall speed -- the columns gave no resistance.""

This DVD is full of detailed analysis like that above that architects and engineers would find compelling, however, it is not too complex for the layperson to understand either. Much of it is just basic physics that most of us got in school.

For many Americans who had previously dismissed ""truthers"" as kooks and nuts just because they didn't have the appropriate creditials (or perhaps because they listened to too much Bill O'Reilly) having more than 200 architects and engineers make the case that we need to reopen the investigation will add much needed credibilty to the Truth movement.",1194566400,23,1719,5.003496503496503
2973566,5,B000WHB8T8,"I own and have viewed Richard Gage's DVD laying out the case that explosive demolitions destroyed the three WTC buildings. It will not convince people who are wedded to the official explanation and refuse to confront contrary evidence. It WILL convince people ready to face the bitter truth that elements of our government conspired to kill American citizens in order to entangle us in a war with the Muslim world.

Richard Gage, AIA, the founder of the Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth and the creator of this DVD, does not go that far.  He only calls for an honest re-investigation of the disaster.  The evidence he so clearly provides does lead me to the conclusion I set forth above.

This is from a group of engineers & architects and an alternative points of view.
The film takes a logical approach in viewing the inconsistencies of much of the data on the collapsing(s). It is not a ""Conspiracy Theory"" film as the film does not address who did what, which group or any such thing.
The information is disputed and much has been resolved... or has it?

It leaves it for you, the viewer to decide. Mr. Gage tells you right in the beginning that you should not just take the information as truth alone.

It is without question one of the most compelling 911 documentaries that prove the 3 towers were brought down by controlled demolition.  I only wish more people could watch films of this quality, to realise what sort of world we are really living in.

There is a complete media blackout on this information, so the majority are being brainwashed with false government reports.  Anyone willing to take their gaze from the mainstream media, can see what evil the government are prepared to do to their own people.

This is a great starting point for anyone trying to unravel the 911 mystery, as it does not deal in conspiracy theory it just gives you the facts.

I have purchased MANY of his DVD's and lend OR give to friends & acquaintances.  So many Americans are willing to fight for their country with rifles, how about fighting with knowledge?

2973590,5,B000WHB8T8,"You don't need to be an Architect, Engineer or building professional to understand the dire implications of this remarkable presentation.  It's almost embarrassing that it should require a mere high school physics course to conclude that explosives were necessary in the near free-fall speed destruction of the Twin Towers and Building 7.

Architect, Richard Gage puts his own evidence through the rigors of the scientific method leaving his audience with little doubt that the government's ""official"" story cannot possibly be true.  Not even the FBI has disagreed with Gage's conclusion.

On 11/7/2008 the FBI received a registered letter along with Gage's DVD.  The letter challenged the FBI act on Gage's conclusion as hard evidence that pre-planted explosives were a necessary part of the destruction of the Twin Towers and WTC7.  On 12/22/2008 the head of FBI's counterterrorism division, Michael J. Hembach, replied that Gage's presentation is ""...backed by thorough research and analysis.""

Richard Gage's support comes from a thousand Architect, engineers and building professionals willing to put their reputations on the line in a patriotic demand for a new 9/11 investigation.

In 2002 the Whitehouse stopped a congressional investigation of the events of 9/11 that was already underway.  When the 9/11 families lobbied congress to demand an investigation a commission was reluctantly formed to look into the failures. Today those who sat on the 9/11 commission admit they were ""setup to fail"" and that they were not alowed to do their job.

In 2009, the rule of law has failed the rights of the 9/11 families to know why their loved-ones were murdered.  Americans can safely use the word ""coverup"" when, despite Gage's conclusive evidence that undermines the government's flimsy story, the biggest holocaust of mass murder in American History remains without a valid investigation or a criminal trial.

Judging from the results of several scientific polls, Americans are becoming increasingly suspicious that the 9/11/2001 attack was more likely a contrived False Flag.

Gage must have spent weeks or months gathering the huge amount of information he presents, organizing the excellent images and fantastic video segments that accompany his talk.  Unfortunately, he is no public speaker.  It looks like he used up all his time collecting and didn't have any left over to rehearse his talk.  He gets lost in mid-sentence repeatedly, and I found some of his mannerisms (due to being nervous, I daresay) really distracting.  He runs on, forgetting to space his topics - paraphrasing him, he might say as he goes from point to point, "". . . and so this molten metal may be a product of thermite is there any way to gain access to the building's frame?  Yes, the elevators are right next to. . . .""  And so on, topic after topic.

But the really distracting part of this very long talk is his constant nervous air-swallowing.  You can watch him do it, then he has to stop to `hiccup' which is a polite way of describing an eructation or belch.  Not once or twice, but ongoing.  He interrupts himself constantly to discharge air that just won't stay down.  It often interrupts his train of thought.

I don't know what to recommend for the poor man.  If he can't settle down in front of an audience, perhaps he should get someone to speak in his place.  Maybe he wouldn't have been so nervous if he had practiced the talk a couple of times in front of a small group.

On the bright side, he includes segments from some other good presentations on DVD - including '9/11 Mysteries' and 'Loose Change' - and has segments of many of the very best 9/11 researchers.  Highly recommended, but beware if you are sensitive to the suffering of the speaker as he talks.",1196899200,4,1957,4.57183908045977

Blueprint for Truth is different in that it focuses specifically on the _three_ high-rise ""collapses"" that occurred that day, staying clear of the panoply of so-called ""conspiracy theories"" (most of which will probably eventually be found to be conspiracy fact), sticking to a well-thought out and structured A to Z presentation of hard evidence, taking the viewer along a critical thinking path that is convincing beyond a reasonable doubt.

I've heard that Richard Gage takes an audience poll when he makes this presentation live, before and after, and invariably almost all (sometimes all) of the doubters and skeptics in the audience are convinced of the case he makes at the end. This is not surprising.

I think this DVD proves that WTC 7, a 50+ floor skyscraper, which also fell that day (around 5:30 p.m.) -- was not hit by a plane, had some minor structural damage from the WTC 1/2 collapses, and a few small fires on several floors -- was absolutely a purposeful controlled demolition. (which take weeks to set up) And, although they look different from ""standard"" controlled demolitions, WTC 1 and 2 were also brought down by some sort of a super-controlled demolition (to try to make them not look like CD's) using some form of explosive collapse scenario. (ostensibly using very-high-temperature thermate/thermite cutter charges, possibly along with other explosive devices)

Taken along with the other DVD's available and books written about the obvious cover-up and whitewash that the 9/11 Commission Report was, and all the rest, it quickly becomes clear that 9/11 was some sort of a false flag operation performed by rogue elements inside and outside of the U.S. government and other agencies against our own country as a pretext for illegal war actions, abridgment of our Constitutional rights, oil-based acquisition scenarios, military industrial complex profiteering, and geo-political empire-building. So far, ""none dare call it treason"". (again, these issues and suppositions are not covered in this DVD -- it is one important piece of the puzzle that helps lead one to these conclusions)

This DVD should be required viewing by all Americans. (and others around the world) It will further, and is furthering, the quickly growing grassroots 9/11 Truth and Justice Movement by leaps and bounds. Great job!

(which take weeks to set up) And, although they look different from ""standard"" controlled demolitions, WTC 1 and 2 were also brought down by some sort of a super-controlled demolition (to try to make them not look like CD's) using some form of explosive collapse scenario. (ostensibly using very-high-temperature thermate/thermite cutter charges, possibly along with other explosive devices)

Taken along with the other DVD's available and books written about the obvious cover-up and whitewash that the 9/11 Commission Report was, and all the rest, it quickly becomes clear that 9/11 was some sort of a false flag operation performed by rogue elements inside and outside of the U.S. government and other agencies against our own country as a pretext for illegal war actions, abridgment of our Constitutional rights, oil-based acquisition scenarios, military industrial complex profiteering, and geo-political empire-building. So far, ""none dare call it treason"". (again, these issues and suppositions are not covered in this DVD -- it is one important piece of the puzzle that helps lead one to these conclusions)

This DVD should be required viewing by all Americans. (and others around the world) It will further, and is furthering, the quickly growing grassroots 9/11 Truth and Justice Movement by leaps and bounds. Great job!

8223427,5,B000WHB8T8,"8/10/17 -- As of this date, and supported by over 3,000 architects and engineers from around the world, plus many others, this film precisely delineates the exact steps taken in demolishing the twin towers. It goes on to examine the demolition of Tower 7, which was not hit by any plane and had only two fires which were nearly out, but was brought down seven hours later by controlled demolition.  This is a fact, and it was all recorded on video.  Steel cannot melt at temperatures produced by a normal fire, even with jet fuel present.  Thermite was necessary to produce the ""molten flow"" of steel which lasted for months afterward in the rubble.  Only special explosives could have reduced everything in those buildings to absolute dust.  A high level of thermite was found in that dust.  There has NEVER been an instance anywhere where a steel-frame building was brought down by fire, not even after burning for 36 hours.  It can't be done with fire alone.  Impossible.  (This entire attack was a ""false flag"" operation against the American people to instill fear and allow for U.S. troops to invade and occupy Near Eastern, oil-rich countries.)  Everyone should see this film.",1502323200,,1182,4.835820895522388

8223429,5,B000WHB8T8,Another DVD showing 911 was a inside job.  A lot of information shown and explained making this DVD a great one to add to your DVD collection. You may wish some of the people talked longer but hey I didn't make it. But a lot of information is said and shown to show how the buildings were brought down. And some of the video concentrated on building #7 and what little damage was done to the actual building yet it came down. Oddly some first responders told the camera operators to get back saying the building was coming down WHILE it was still standing.,1395014400,2,556,4.346153846153846
8223430,5,B000WHB8T8,"This was an excellent film because it focused on the evidence. It doesn't follow fanciful theories, it just follows the evidence. Reviewers that disapproved make the usual ad hominem acusations of ""fringe group"" or ""conspiracy theory"" and reduce the intelligence of the discussion. I don't know what the origin of their reason, but it certainly is not scientific evidence.",1360281600,,372,5.322033898305085
8223431,5,B000WHB8T8,"This documentary provides compelling evidence that 9/11 was ""not as it seemed""  How do David Copperfield and David Blaine do it?  There are tricks of the trade.  Because the American people were so traumatized by this violent false flag event, they were willing to believe the ""party line"" which is just plain idiotic if you give it any thought whatsoever.  Join the calm, cool, collected team of architects and engineers (not exactly the loopiest demographic, are they?) in examining the HARD EVIDENCE, the scientific DATA, which proves that things were not as our government presented them to be.  Kudos to these brave and intelligent men and women for coming forward with this awkward, but obvious truth.",1351036800,,707,5.060344827586207
8223432,3,B000WHB8T8,"I thought these people would be a bunch of crackpots, but that wasn't the case. They definitely knew their stuff. Very thought provoking and interesting. The scientific information was over my head but I got the general gist of it. It is still hard to imagine it to be true, but definitely worth a look and certainly something to ponder over. We will never know the whole truth about 9/11 I guess, at least not in my lifetime.

8223433,5,B000WHB8T8,"When 9/11 occurred, I was an 8th grader in South Florida, and an extremely impressionable patriot. I watched in horror as the second tower fell live on the television in my drama class. I wanted action! How dare the ""evil-doers"" do such a thing to my fellow Americans!

I continued to believe 9/11 was as the government said it was and was fed the stories CNN wanted me to follow. It never occurred to me the govt. might be responsible or at least had knowledge of what was to occur that day. The idea that my America, the land I pledge my allegiance to, could be responsible for the loss of 3,000 American lives in an attack of that nature was absurd.

Richard Gage, a Californian architect changed my perception of reality and patriotism. He lays out evidence, using the scientific method, to support the theory of a controlled demolition in a non-biased way. I see this DVD as a starting point for anyone who wants to hear another side of the story, as we all know there are two sides to every story. This will make you consider for a moment the ramifications of creating a crisis. Obviously this event was the reason for the Bush administration to rally public support for a war on (of) terror, and also gave them just cause to take away many of our civil liberties with the passage of the Patriot Act. As I said previously, I believe this DVD should be a starting point for anyone who can think objectively. This was the first 9/11 DVD I saw and it made me do more independent research.

I personally think the fact that Building 7, a building that was never hit by a plane, was never even mentioned in the 9/11 commission's final report, is enough to raise suspicion by any rational person.

I personally feel this DVD is crucial material for the American public. It was even broadcast on Public Television- KBDI PBS in Colorado in 2009.",1289260800,12,1843,4.492537313432836
8223434,5,B000WHB8T8,"There are many videos out there about 9/11's WTC collapses, but by far this is the single most convincing argument for controlled demolition, because it shows professionals experience and knowledge applied to the events of that day. They provide logic our official report fails to provide. This is a must-see video presentation.",1286236800,7,328,5.326923076923077
8223435,1,B000WHB8T8,"From the beginning, this movie at every juncture pushes the viewer towards their assumption that 9/11 was controlled demolition.  I have already seen other documentaries that debunk their weak theories.  NONSENSE and a total waste of time.",1283990400,4,239,5.4324324324324325
8223436,5,B000WHB8T8,Blueprint for Truth is the single best presentation I have ever seen in my life. It is delivered by a fabulous architect by the name of Richard Gage. He speaks on behalf of hundreds of other architects and engineers. They have assembled a really refined presentation. It is a stunning piece. They are not conspiracy theorists. They don't get involved in political points of view. They are scientists show us the many ways in which the media covers up what happened on 9/11. Don't miss this show. This is the companion edition that is not quite as good as the longer two-hour research edition. Don't miss the two hour show because it's loaded with details that you will want to see. This is just superb on every level.,1283126400,9,717,4.609375
