8505903,4,B006WY0X4Q,"The editorial review says this is about storm chasers.  The cover suggests that the synopsis under this title for the Military Channel is more appropriate, that this is a series about the development of current and pending military systems.  This is not so much a review as a request that Amazon double check the accuracy of the editorial review.  The page for reporting errors does not include an option to challenge the accuracy of the editorial reviews.",1393113600,,456,4.896103896103896
