8018709,5,B0001Z648G,"Jim Reeves is the best thing about this  show 'Town Hall Party"" from February 14,1959. I skip over all the other acts I've never heard of to see him. There's no one like Mr. Reeves among today's Country singers. He was 35 years old then. He was killed in a crash of his new Beechcraft Debonair airplane on July 31,1964,twenty days shy of his 41st birthday.",1374451200,,356,4.393939393939394
8018710,5,B0001Z648G,"On February 14, 1959, ""Town Hall Party"" had the rare, special privilege of a guest appearance by one of the greatest stars of Country music, and a member of the ""Grand Ole Opry"" in Nashville, Tennessee, in Jim Reeves.  And Jim Reeves lived up to his billing.  Reeves sang and performed on stage with an acoustic guitar, something that he would rarely do (at least on television) later in the 1960s.  He performed two sets of three songs on the Los Angeles-based television program, which aired on KTTV Los Angeles, and was broadcast nationally on NBC Radio.  Jim Reeves was well-known for being a Country crooner since his signing with RCA Records in 1956.  But in this performance, viewers and listeners got to experience the ""Cowboy"" side of Jim Reeves.  During the ""Medley"" of several Country Waltzes, Reeves was really belting it out for ""Tennessee Waltz""  Never have I seen Jim Reeves sing with more passion, conviction, and emotional authenticity than I did during this segment.  Later in the first set, Reeves cuts loose, and has fun singing one of his earier hits from his tenure at Abbott Records, entitled, ""Bimbo"".  Here is Jim Reeves at his best, having fun singing and playing the guitar, and interacting with his audience, and it was a large crowd at that, at around 2,000 people in attendence, with large crowds of people seen in the audience camera shots.

In the second set, Jim Reeves sings, ""Blue Boy"", ""Am I Losing You"", and a song requested by a member of the audience, ""Anna Marie"".  In between the two sets, ""Town Hall Party"" cast member Johnny Bond interviews Jim Reeves and another special guest, Tommy Duncan.  Both of them were scheduled to appear at an important Country music show at the Showboat Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, along with Hank Thompson And His Brazos Valley Boys.  Reeves stated in the interview that he had performed numerous times in Nevada, but never before in Las Vegas up to this point.  He appeared on ""Town Hall Party"" to make a special appeal for the Los Angeles fans to make the trip to Las Vegas to see him, as well as the other Country artists, perform in concert there.

Tommy Duncan also made a guest appearance on this episode of ""Town Hall Party"", and performed four songs during two sets.  Several other artists also appeared in this 1 hour, 30 minute program (there were no commercials on this DVD, per se.  There was a billboard ad in the stage background for Vel's Ford auto dealership).  The following is the list of program segments from ""Town Hall Party:  February 14, 1959"":

Jim Reeves did a fabulous performance here on this broadcast of ""Town Hall Party"", providing the viewer a glimpse of what a Jim Reeves concert would have looked like and sounded like in 1959.  Since concert footage of Jim Reeves is extremely rare, this makes this live television and radio performance a very special treat for Country Music And Pop Music fans in general, and Jim Reeves fans in particular.  ""Town Hall Party"" was recorded in the form of a kinescope (which is a movie camera and microphone pointed to a television monitor in the broadcast booth, or from a TV set in the local TV station's broadcast range).  This form of preservation of television programming in the years before videotape recording became widely available, sometimes lead to varying degrees of picture quality and sound.  On this program, there were times when the picture was somewhat dark, but that would change when the director switched to another television camera, allowing the camera in question to be adjusted by the cameraman.  The picture would also flicker, which was due to the relatively slow speed of the light guns inside the cathode ray tubes manufactured in the first generations of television sets.  But with these problems mentioned, it DID NOT make this episode of ""Town Hall Party"" unwatchable.  The picture is otherwise clear, and the viewer can clearly recognize all of the Country and Rock stars and musicians and see their musical instruments clearly.  Audio quality is not a problem on this DVD, because since this program was simulcast on NBC Radio, the audio tapes were preserved in excellent condition, and the performances were made into a series of LPs back in the late-1950s and early-1960s.

I highly recommend that you buy this landmark live television performance by one of the greatest singers in the history of Country and Pop music, Jim Reeves.  This is as close as any of us will ever get to seeing Jim Reeves in concert.  Don't miss out on this rare musical experience.  This DVD is worth every penny that you pay for it.",1344297600,2,5948,4.843098311817279
