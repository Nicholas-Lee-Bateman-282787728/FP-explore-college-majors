8746391,5,B01A1C1VNG,"This documentary was simply Amazing! A job well done! I was so moved from watching this, that I became inspired to interview my Grandmother on camera to seek answers regarding our family history, and to help me along my own journey to become a better person. Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis were simply, black royalty. As a person that grew up heavily engaged into theater arts, I have always admired Ruby Dee for her art, her activism, and what she stood for. The love story aspect of the documentary was very captivating, needless to say, I believe we all want that Ruby Dee - Ossie Davis type of Love.",1459641600,,597,4.486238532110092

In this film documentary a grandson explores a legacy of experience and wisdom left for him by his activist/celebrity grandparents--based on their own oral history and testimony. Wonderfully researched and told. What interesting lives they lived together--what a legacy for their grandchildren who remain on earth to share.,1457740800,,396,5.728813559322034
8746394,5,B01A1C1VNG,"Yes, I loved it, and my family loved it.  I should say ""loves"" it, because we all have watched it several times over.  It is about the best documentary I have ever seen.  I did not know Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis were so active in the civil rights movement.  They used their celebrity status to reach far more powerful people than the average protester could reach.  The famous were making statements for the poor!  I love every bit of the stories told by their grandson, and I am so happy he saw fit to honor his grandparents in such a royal style.",1457568000,,547,4.262135922330097
