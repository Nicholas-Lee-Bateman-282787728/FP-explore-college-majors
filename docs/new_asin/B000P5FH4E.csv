2810511,5,B000P5FH4E,"I recently received the 2-DVD set of  Gladiator (Extended Edition) and Braveheart together in the set called The Epic Legends Collection.  I love both of these movies, but to get them both in one set was wonderful.  They played flawlessly on my player, the quality was excellent, and the movies shine when viewed one after the other.  It's a great combination of two great, yet vastly different, movies, and they really go together like only the peanut butter and chocolate of a Reese's.  I highly recommend this set to anyone who does not already have both of these.  I also want to point out that the Extended Edition of Gladiator has some great scenes cut back into it which go far in explaining some of the scenes you might not truly have understood from the theatrical version of the film.  Definitely a must-have for any fan of the Gladiator film.",1288656000,3,853,4.6466666666666665

More often than not, there will be one great movie and one terrible movie.  With this DVD pack, you get two great movies!

For me, this is saying a lot.  Both Russell Crowe and Mel Gibson rub me entirely the wrong way and I find myself not enjoying their movies very much.  These two, however, are both great films and well worth your time to watch.  The cost of this DVD is so low that you almost have to get it!",1427155200,2,578,4.053097345132743

Gladiator is about 66% fiction, but that doesn't detract from the fact that it is in the top 25 of my all time favorite films. the same could be said for Braveheart.",1403827200,3,642,4.103174603174603

Caveat: I book all of my movies, so I don't care about the case. Each movie has its own disc, so they go into their own sleeves. I can envision some people being upset that both movies are in the same case... so make up your mind about how you'd like to present your movies, and then choose accordingly.

Gladiator is also great, and the ""Battle of Carthage"" scene is still among my favorite of all time.  The CGI of Rome looks good, and the landscapes of Spain and Africa look great.

Heed the warnings about the restored/nonrestored alternative versions.  I bought mine in December 2011 and still got the first version.  Be sure to call Paramount at 888-889-9456 (h/t to reviewer ""EZ"") to get the right version.  There are still pallets of bad product out there years later.

2810684,5,B000P5FH4E,"The item arrived very quickly, only days after I ordered it. I was very pleasantly surprised by how quick it was. I reccomend Amazon anytime you want something. Item was also brand new as described. Why these two movies were packaged together I don't know, because there's not much similarity about them at all, that I can see. Both movies involve tyrant leaders and politics, but that's about the only similarity I can see. Joaquin Phoenix is the best thing about Gladiator. To watch him play such a dark and evil character and make him interesting as well as whimpy, and the incestuous love he has for his sister...I don't know why it's fun to watch, but it's kind of an unusual character. Now that I've seen Gladiator and listened to the commentary by Russel Crowe and Ridley Scott, I know a lot more about the way things worked in the ancient Roman times and the kind of brutality that was acceptable. It's a shame to think that people used to actually pay people to cut each other up and that people considered that entertaining. That's very sad. Gladiator is a pretty educational movie if you're interested in history, though most of what you'll learn won't be pleasant things. Braveheart is about the Scottish trying to prevent the English from destroying them, and there's a subplot about a homosexual prince who is forcefully married to a heterosexual princess and there's a lot of drama about why their arranged marriage can't work. I don't understand why the princess has so much hatred and contempt for her homosexual husband--illustrated in a line, after she's said his father the king is ""incapable of mercy"", she says to her husband ""And you. To you that word is as unfamiliar as love.""--as if she should have expected him to love her when she knew the marriage was forced on him. I can understand not wanting to be friendly with someone whom you were forced to be with. I don't know why she thinks she has a right to resent him for that. Just because he didn't love *her* doesn't mean that he was unfamiliar with love or incapable of love or didn't know what love means. That's the only thing in Braveheart that I don't understand.",1326412800,,2147,4.637795275590551

In fact everything indicated that my disc would be the older version on the packaging but when I opened it up it was the remastered version.  In fact my special features disc (disc 2) was from the old version so it looks like they just swapped out my disc 1 from the this set for the new one.

Next I looked for the Title card at the start of the movie--does the word ""Gladiator"" stays black--CHECK

I know I went over board but I've never seen the original pre remastered copy to compare to and I wanted to be absolutely sure

Someone wrote a review here that they received the older pre remastered copies..TWICE..As far as I know this seems unlikely..There was a problem early on(over a year ago) when they were sending the yellow UPC copies with the older version but this was isolated event and only in Canada. Paramount realized their mistake..Plus, this was long before this double pack was even an idea..

Next--The aspect ration is listed here AND BY PARAMOUNT AS 1.85:1..This is not correct..these are the same versions of the Sapphire Collections that are 2.35:1

The Movies speak for themselves..Great movies..Nothing more to say

The PQ and SQ on both are above standard..

Gladiator could have used SOME light DNR but I think they were afraid to do anything to this after the OVERUSE(I cannot stress this snough) of DNR and EE on the first release..

Paramount messed up with this and really messed up with the re release..almost making it..Making it a Sherlock Holmes-esque mystery to figure out.

2810748,5,B000P5FH4E,"This review deals with the issue of the delivery of remastered copy of the Gladiator BD with this bundle. I got my copy of the BD bundle from Amazon about Sept. 14 2011 and are as follows:
1. ""Gladiator"" in the opening credits is in BLACK wording, so it should be the re-mastered one, as the reviewer Aaron suggested.
2. Both DVDs of Gladiator in the set are light grey,
3. There is a Yellow UPC,
4. There is also '2-DISC SET' above the Paramount logo on the back of casing, as some reviewers suggest.
5. Interestingly the year on the BD-DVD itself is 2009 but the year on the case is 2010.
6. In the underside of the Gladiator Disk 1, the string of characters are: BVDL- then a six-digit number and 'B1'; this is in the inner circle; in the outer circle is BVDL- then the same six-digit number and 'A1'. That is, there is no more letters after 'B1' and certainly no 'R2'. This seems to be the new string of characters the distributors use.

The Braveheart part of this twin-pack is the same old, reference quality version - no point discussing that one - so my review will focus mainly on the confusion of Remastered vs Old (DNR-laden) version of the Gladiator BD.
First of all, you can confirm which version you have with Paramount at 888-889-9456, as opposed to trusting rumours being spread by guessing folks :).

The first thing they ask you is if the UPC label is all yellow (remastered, new version) or white (old version). This seems now also the only necessary ""proof"" of having the new version - I suppose they don't ship new versions with white UPC anymore.

Also, regarding the alphanumerical sequence on the inside of the back of Disc 1, it can be a number of combos that indicate the new version - not only the B1R2 (remastered) vs B1R1 (old version) - so you are better off just giving them what you have and they will cross check it for you. I have the Remastered version and my disc has ""BVDL-103860B1"" on it, which is also a CONFIRMED way to tell the remastered version apart from the old one.

Furthermore, there was a mention of the new version having the title ""Gladiator"" on black letters vs gold letters for the old version - NOT TRUE, as I have a gold-titled BD and it is a remastered copy.

The new version also NO LONGER has the white security sticker at the top of the case. And then there is the ""2-Disc Set"" above the Paramount Logo at the back (right bottom corner) on the new, remastered version.

And the final test, of course, would be to check if you can see the arrows and catapult ammunition in flight without them disappearing into thin air during the first battle scene of the movie.

Bottom line is, if you are still in doubt, just call Paramount :)",1316304000,6,1920,4.455840455840455

if you love braveheart and gladiator (and if you don't, something is severely wrong with your taste in moves) this is a must buy for any bluray collection.",1312761600,4,881,4.556962025316456
2810770,5,B000P5FH4E,"There were lots of concerns as to what this bundle was.  Taking a chance, I pre-ordered it.  It's actually 2 of the sapphire releases bundled together.  So if you were to take Braveheart sapphire, remove the paper cover, then take the Gladiator sapphire, remove its paper cover, shrinkwrap the two together, and place it in a single paper cover.  This is what you get.  You get 2 double disc cases, the movies packaged separately.  Not a single 4-disc case.  No slim cases.

From what I can tell, the Gladiator version has a copyright of 2010, has a yellow UPC and appears to have the R2 code on the disc itself.  This means you also get the re-mastered version, instead of the flawed old one.

Considering Amazon sells each individually for more than the bundle price, this makes a per-movie cost the least I've ever paid for a Sapphire release, and the lowest price I've ever seen for any Sapphire release.",1312416000,129,908,4.61875
2810771,5,B000P5FH4E,"Just received my copy from Amazon, these are not slim packs but the Saphire discs.  In total 4 discs in total, 2 for braveheart and 2 for gladiator.  Hope this helps you in your decision.",1312243200,55,187,4.314285714285714
2810772,5,B000P5FH4E,I received my pre-ordered blu-ray versions of Gladiator and Braveheart today.  They are wonderful. I watched a little of Gladiator and Braveheart and the picture is outstanding.  Its also great having the extended versions of the movie.  They have many new scenes not in the theatrical version.  I can't wait to watch both movies all the way through.  These are two of my favorite movies of all time.,1312243200,6,400,4.823529411764706
2810773,5,B000P5FH4E,"I pre-ordered this 2 pack a few weeks ago and just got it today. I know there were a lot of people who held off on pre-ordering this, because it was unclear if this would include the special features of both movies, or if it would be a new packing of just the movies themselves.

I can confirm that the special features are included. It is a 4 disc set and each movie is in its own packaging. They're not in slim packs, either. What you get is 2 discs for each movie, in the original, full size blu-ray package. They come bundled in a slipcover, which is what you see pictured on Amazon's item description.

And at $18.99, this is cheaper than you could buy either movie individually. A great bargain.",1312243200,61,701,4.303030303030303
2810774,5,B000P5FH4E,Apparently both of these titles were initially put on blu-ray using the DVD versions of the movie and looked horrible in HD (missing artifacts/blurring). They were finally remastered correctly within the last 6-8 months but there were still reports of people getting the bad releases delivered. Not only do I not have to worry about getting the newest conversions with this but I get both of the movies I've been needing to add to my collection?
