8711962,5,B00W3S8UI6,"This is a very important work. I believe that the vast majority of Americans in our country have no real idea of what life is like on the inside of a prison. The average tax-paying citizen believes their tax dollars are purchasing 3 nutritious meals per day, safety for the held and some form of rehabilitation. This belief could not be any farther from the truth. This film is a powerful vessel by which to unearth the realities and horrors of prison life. Those who have relatives on the ""inside"" are all too aware of the fallacy. However, those who accept the media's version of ""help and protection to society"" are tragically misinformed. News of the gross over population and inhumane treatment of those incarcerated needs to be made public. The privatization of the prison system has only worked to line the pockets of Corporate America while it continues to breakdown the fabric of the American family.  Mr. Newton, you have done a great service to your society in this film. It is my sincere hope that Outcasts continues to make strides in educating the public about the long-term harm to society done by mass incarceration. It is no badge of honor for the United States to hold the record for the highest rate of incarceration and prison overpopulation in the world.",1431302400,,1275,4.743243243243243
8711963,5,B00W3S8UI6,"Although focusing on recidivism in Tennessee, Outcasts shines a light on a problem that has metastasized to almost every community in the country.  You'll find the underlying profit motive and how it exacerbates the problem quite shocking.

Having already aired on PBS and numerous film festivals around the country, this documentary is a real eye opener and an important contribution to the discussion regarding how our prison system works...or doesn't.",1429056000,,454,5.4714285714285715
8711964,5,B00W3S8UI6,"An excellent examination of one of society's pressing problems...and of the Catch 22 we impose on those who have spent time in prison.

Thankfully, this issue is gaining traction at the local level across the country, and there seems to be a growing recognition of the impracticality (as well as inhumanity) of imposing a life sentence on those who have paid for their crimes.

The documentary is a powerful amalgam of personal stories and factual information, and makes its case in a reasoned way.  Highly recommended for anyone concerned about the future of our society.",1428969600,,572,5.0
