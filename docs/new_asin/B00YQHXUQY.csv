8718785,3,B00YQHXUQY,"April Love is a favorite of mine but hate besides the titles was not in wide screen.  Why would 20th Centruy Fox mess up good movies with a pan and scan version.  Does anyone want that kind of version so you do not see the whole shots on the screen.  I doubt it and all three films are like that.
April Love is the best of the trio with Mardi Gras second and All Hands on Deck in the rear.
Where is Bernadine the best Pat Boone picture for Fox?  It should be on DVD also and in wide screen.",1443484800,5,490,3.87
