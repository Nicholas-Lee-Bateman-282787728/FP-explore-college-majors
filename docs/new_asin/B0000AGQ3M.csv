1905994,5,B0000AGQ3M,"This dvd will surely keep you entertained for hours! I liked the fact that i could watch all of the episodes at one time without waiting a week before the next episode. The dvd has no errors, runs smooth,and has two interviews with the writers. The only part that could get annoying is that the original intro and ending credits appear at the beginning and end of each episode. But that can be easily overlooked if you use ff on ur remote. All in all this is a great dvd. Wish it had more special features but hey, the episodes alone contain at least 12 hours of entertainment BLI$$. May the Beast Wars live on!!!!!",1061424000,3,615,4.356521739130435
1905995,5,B0000AGQ3M,"My friend got me interested in Beast Wars in 1998, two years after it's
debut and I have loved it since.  I don't care what anyone says about it
Beast Wars has to be the best Transformers series ever! If you still pefer
 the original series you have to check out the episode Possetion!  Now to
get to the main aspects of the DVD.  There are 26 episodes on this DVD.
The special features include about ten minute interviews with the series two
main writers Larry DiTillio and Bob Forward. I highly recomend this to any
transformer fan!",1061164800,8,534,4.418367346938775
1905996,5,B0000AGQ3M,"Before anything else, let me just say that I THANK Rhinomation for bringing Transformers, Beast Wars, and (crosses fingers) maybe Beast Machines in full form, DVD quality!
Though many people love the G1 Transformers series better for its longer run, the movie, and more characters, in my mind, Beast Wars beats it hands down.  The plots are more interesting, the characterizations are better, the writers are better, the action is more intense, and there's none of those annoying humans that wear only one set of clothes.
I just hope Season Two and Three come in one set, as they're only 13 episodes in each.",1060646400,,608,4.846153846153846
1905997,5,B0000AGQ3M,"this collect is the best, more superior than the original because of the dialogue, the transforming in 3d, and then for future ones to be released, just the way they alwasy intrepeted the old transforming into everything they do in the beast wars.
i always wanted to see a cartoon series with these bots in 3d. at first i did not like the fact that they brought them back as animals but in the end it worked out for the better. so pick this up and you will be satisfied. oh yeah and by the way this was done in the mid 90's so the animation isn't all that but it gets better as the series goes on, just watch and see.",1060300800,,617,4.065573770491803
1905998,5,B0000AGQ3M,"This is my favorite of all the Transformer incarnations because there was comedy, action, and drama.  The characters were very relatable and they grew on you.  Even though not all the toys created for the series made it on the show because it was done in CGI, it made for more character depth for the ones that did make it.  Possibly the best Transformers story out there!!",1057536000,2,373,4.537313432835821
1905999,5,B0000AGQ3M,"Oh my god!  My brother had a ton of the original transformers and I thought they were really great, but what I really wanted was transformers all of my own.  Low and behold Beast Wars arrived and I was addicted.  This is the type of show that I would wait so anxiously all week for the new episode and when I finally saw it, I was already thinking about the next.  The first season was excellent and all the characters were unique and played well off each other, each one had so much life even though they weren't real!  The battle has begun... these are the Beast Wars!",1057363200,2,570,4.2407407407407405

1906001,5,B0000AGQ3M,"This was a show that I always woke up early for just to see among other shows since I always loved shows with animals in them.  Even though these guys are just robotic animals, I still thought they were pretty cool to look at.  But then it was taken off air and I felt terrible about it ever since.  When I learned that this show was coming out to DVD, I just had to save up enough money to buy the series, and sure enough, I finally got it.  Now I watch it as many times as I can and reliving the days when I used to watch it on television.  It is so awesome.",1411171200,,560,3.8347826086956522
1906002,5,B0000AGQ3M,"Only transformers prime comes close to this show. At first I wasn't sure where the characters came from or who they were, but that gets cleared pretty fast. The animation is very good, considering this was when cgi was first being used, and then only some. The characters were fleshed out much more then the original show, and given much different surroundings. The planet is not reveled as Earth until season two. I also enjoyed seeing Dinobot( not to be confused with the Dinobots form the first show) change and grow as the dhow went on, even if he does eat his clone. I recommend this to any transformers fans, or anyone just looking for a really good cartoon.",1404000000,,664,4.588235294117647

1906005,5,B0000AGQ3M,"Back when I was going to school, before I dropped out to be a masked magical crime fighter slash wicker basket weaver, I would watch this show everyday before heading to class. My excitement elevated when I walked into SunCoast and found all 3 seasons.... but I only had enough for 2. Years later, I decided it was time to complete my collection. The box was a little used but the show was still awesome. Well sort of. Now that I'm older I was noticing some animation issues within some of the earlier episodes. Be that as it may, all discs worked, I was able to have a marathon and watch the whole thing from beginning to the end.",1372377600,,631,4.310924369747899
1906006,3,B0000AGQ3M,"Transformers Beast Wars came out in the year 1996-1999. I was in high school at that time and I would watch it everyday after school. Always get mad at myself if I were to miss even one episode of Beast Wars. Its still just as I've remember it but I thought Rattrap was shot in this season. I choose this season out of the other two because this as far as I want to go with this. Beast Wars fall short in the same way the G1 Transformers series fell short in. No originality. G1 Transformers fell in the Rebirth episodes with the headmasters & targetmasters. With Beast Wars you have way too many ties in to the original G1 series. In the episode Possession, Starscream's ghost or spark possess Waspinator's body wanting to second in command to Megatron. Yes Starscream was a ghost in G1 season three but was giving back his body by the head of Unicron. So Beast Wars got that one wrong and I'm not even going to go to the other two seasons. What Beast Wars did for Transformers was revamp it and they did a good job at it to a point. After season one the series was losing it luster and was really lose its luster on season three. Beast Wars should have stay with the originally it had in season one. Instead it tried so hard to be as machine-like as the original G1 Transformers with was a big mistake for the Best Wars series.",1371600000,,1329,4.256916996047431

It's up for $114 right now, so maybe shop around a bit?",1280620800,,326,4.030769230769231
1906014,4,B0000AGQ3M,"Beast Wars Transformers was the first Transformers series that I was able to get into, mostly cause the Generation One series started when I was only 9 months old at the time.  While that this series I started watching with my brother, though I never thought I'd get into the series but after a few episodes I was hooked into the series.  I think that it's cause of the story telling that went on throughout the show that drew me into watching this show, while at the same time it blended humor into it very well.  Although the first season is 26 episodes long, giving enough time to develop the characters throughout the season as well as get in what they wanted to help bring the show to where they wanted to take it.  While at first it didn't seem like that this show would tie in to that of Generation 1, but as the season goes on there are mentions of the original Transformers show.  The CGI animation for this show was a first for the whole Transformers franchise and although it wasn't the best looking though it was able to manage for the time that it was done, think this was done in the mid-90's.  My only complaint of this set is that two of the episodes, `A Better Mousetrap' and `The Probe' are in the wrong order, although on the back of the case they're in the correct order.  Overall I give this set 4.5 stars out of 5.",1280448000,,1336,4.277777777777778

1906016,5,B0000AGQ3M,"Yes, thank you Canada for this lovely DVD set! I used to have the whole Beast Wars Rhino collection, but had to unfortunately part ways. Since then they have become scarce and expensive to buy. Then along came this Alliance distributed version of season 1. Much appreciated!
  This is my favorite TV series ever! Such great characters and story writting exist in few of today's children's programming. Yes, to be honest, the CGI that created this is quite outdated. But come on! This was one of the first all CGI shows ever. They were definately at testing phase here. Plus the visuals aren't what mainly draw me to the show. Again it's the characters. They take their time to showcase and develop the characters here and they all have an important part to play. Dinobot, the villain turned confused hero, is my favorite character because of his complexness.
  And if you're one of those people who loved the origional Transformers growing up, but wasn't thrilled with the one snippet or episode you saw of this: Give it another shot. This show isn't meant to be a remake of the origional, but rather an addition to. And if you stick with it long enough it WILL pay off for all G1 fans!
  My only chief complaint about this particular box set, I feel, is minor enough to still give it my 5 stars. I just wish there were a chapter selection within each episode, much like Rhino did. But that's pretty much it! Well, that and an interview or 2 would have been nice!
  But still, I highly reccommend this DVD set. I just wish the Alliance versions of seasons 2 and 3 would wind up on here, if they were produced at all!",1266883200,2,1616,4.491467576791809

The Beast Wars series tied in well with the Transformers saga, while still being it's own thing. The Maximals and the Predacons battle for a foothold, and a way back home, on a primative planet(earth, far in the past). A whole new roster of characters(not the original Megatron but a new one, and not Optimus Prime but Optimus Primal), different forms, and new potential allies & enemies.

1906022,4,B0000AGQ3M,"Sort of like a fungus.  The best way to enjoy Beast Wars is to think of it like a drinking game.  Every time they zoom in to Cheetor's animal face looking roundeyed and surprised, drink! Every time someone says ""beast wars"" like they're expecting a papier-mache duck to drop down like it's the Secret Word, drink! Every time Rattrap says something racially insensitive to Dinobot, drink! Every time Megatron ends a sentence with a long drawn out 'Yeeeess' or 'Noooo'.... well, you get the idea.

The first few episodes were kind of dull, and to be honest, I wasn't all that impressed with the CGI.  Now, I'm notoriously unimpressed with CGI, so take that with a grain of salt. It does get better toward the end of the season.  I think it was an experiment to counteract the fact the Japanese were kicking our butts with traditional animation. Still, after a while you stop wincing at the animations and how we seem to keep staring at everyone's beast-mode butt, and eventually, the plotting picks up.

Midseason, there's some downright solid writing.  ""Possession"" is a personal favorite, because not only is Starscream back, we get a few of the absolute best exchanges in the entire season. And the pop culture references start happening, and basically, it stops taking itself so darn seriously.

There are a few continuity...things.  Stuff we see once and never again that you'd think would be important.  Giant floating island crash-landed near the Maximal base? No one tries to salvage it? Being in beast mode for too long schizes you out?  What about Tigatron?  Predacon base being blown to heck how many times now?  Where'd the tanglers from Sentinel's security net go when the Preds actually make it into the base? And why, oh why, do we need females?  Are they essential to procreation? (They sure all have great racks!) If they are needed to reproduce, do I really want to know if it's done in beast mode or not?

""The Low Road"" is the watershed episode in this series. Based on a fart-joke that would have made Chaucer proud, it brings a goofiness to the series which lingers on in things like Megatron brushing his dino-head's teeth, Inferno calling Megatron his 'queen', etc.

It's a cartoon series made basically to shill toys, but midway along (and all through season two) it takes on a life of its own. Does it compare to G1?  Yes, and no. It's a good series with deeper characterization than G1, but it is hobbled by the creative control of Hasbro.  You have to give it a decent try: don't decide just on the first episode or two.",1231977600,2,2546,4.683146067415731

I didn't watch all with them but what ever i got to see was pretty good - excellent writing - I think the animation was a turn off for me. but non the less good one .,1212105600,,271,3.610169491525424
1906027,4,B0000AGQ3M,"So, if you're reading this review you're probably obsessively going through every single bloody review on this page in hopes of finding something new and illuminating to help you decide whether or not to buy this thing, I probably can't provide it. The main reason is that, unlike you, I do not have the stamina to read all fifty-something reviews before my eyes pop out of my head in search of someone willing to water them. As such, anything in my review may well be in another review already, better stated and with less of a preamble. So, rather than drum up some original praise for the series, I'm going to attempt to offer some original and in-depth criticism, despite the fact that I would have been the biggest Beast Wars fanboy on the planet had my lower-class-white-anglo-saxon-protestant upbringing not taught me better than to spend my limited allowance money on action figures and swag. Besides, I liked the show, not the toys.

Anyway, on to the review.

As others have mentioned, the first season of Beast Wars, while good, is far outshined by the second, and even perhaps by the prematurely aborted third. It is not as dark, witty, or free of Saturday-morning cartoon cliches as the other two seasons. For this I blame the writers. My guess is that Larry Datillo et al were going for volume, not quality, trying to get a new episode out every day in order to establish a regular watching crowd (something that's hard to do when some syndicates air your show at 6am). By the time second season rolled around, my guess is that Bob Forward had rolled up his sleeves, gave everyone a good slap on the face and demanded that everyone not get too sidetracked from the main story arc.

What's more, the plot takes so long to develop that a really picky viewer might begin to wonder whether the series is really going anywhere. First season doesn't accomplish in 26 episodes what the other seasons do with 12. Don't get me wrong, I like episodic storytelling as much as the next guy, and not every episode has to move the arc forward. ""Equal Measures,"" for instance, had some decent character development, adding complexity to Dinobot's character, something it's Datillo-written atrophied twin ""The Web"" didn't manage. Datillo must have been insanely jealous about this and arranged a brain transplant with Greg Johnson (the writer of Equal Measures), because Johnson's next episode ""Gorilla Warfare,"" despite some redeeming moments, came straight out of the tradition of ""Power Surge"" (another Datillo episode): pump up one of the characters with robo-hormones and turn him loose to wreak destruction on his own side (if he's a good guy, he gets to blow up the other side eventually as well). Datillo's episodes, by contrast, get a lot better, though that could just be because he gets to write all the cool episodes, like ""The Spark"" and the two-part season finale, ""Other Voices.""

Contrary to what at least one reviewer said, death never really comes up in this series until-
SPOILER WARNING
-the very last episode of the first season, and even that's obviously going to be a resurrection job which you can spot from a mile away if you:
A) were a fan of the original series and know intuitively that characters with ""Optimus Prim-"" as part of their names can never be truly killed
B) have ever watched kids programming where this sort of thing happens all the time
and/or C) are not a complete retard.

The same reviewer who promised you death also promised that good characters would occasionally do evil things, and this is true approximately three times: two in the case of Dinobot, and once in the case of Rhinox, when he gets reprogrammed to be a bad guy. That's right- these instances of ""good guys bein' bad"" are nothing more than the bad guys (who happen to be allied with the good guys) being bad. I call shenanigans. What's more, the ""evil"" acts are more like, ""semi-questionable acts, if you're a really self-righteous legalistic butt-munch."" So Dinobot eats his clone. Whoop-dee-frickin-doo. It would have made a bad recurring character, and we got to see a Transformer burp. Also, he puts Cheetor's life at risk by persuading Optimus to put a bomb in the Predacon base, where Cheetor is. This would be halfway bad, but it seems that Dinobot is really just grinding his axe about wanting to kill Megatron, which is just a reflection of the fact that he's still a Predacon at heart. See? Only the bad guys are bad.

In short, buy this season (you'll like it, and so will your kids), so that you can watch the second and third season (which you will love).",1206057600,2,4579,4.739021329987453
1906028,4,B0000AGQ3M,"From the creators of the computer animated series Reboot, Beast Wars premiered in the mid-90's with a different spin on the Transformers lore.  The series begins with the heroic Maximals (the descendants of the Autobots) and the villainous Predicons (the descendents of the Decepticons) crash landing on what appears to be Earth after the dinosaurs became extinct and brief signs of civilization began to stir.  Instead of transforming into vehicles, the bots transform into various animals and beasts (hence the title), as they do battle over this first season.  Though there were decidedly two camps when Beast Wars premiered (fans of the classic Transformers series either enjoyed it or hated it, with myself originally being one of the haters), there is something about the show that just grows on you.  The characterizations offer all sorts of odes to the classic series, as the Maximals consist of leader Optimus Primal, young Cheetor, motormouth Rattrap, former Predicon-turned Maximal Dinobot, scientific officer Rhinox, and eventually newer members Tigertron and Air Razor.  The Predicons offer leader Megatron, the treacherous Tarantulas, Black Arachnia (who would go on to play a vital role in the series' development), Scorpinok, the crazy and annoying Waspinator, and Terasaur.  The show only gets better with each progressing episode, and the season ending cliffhanger will have you begging for more as a heroic sacrifice leads to the question: just who is behind all this?  All in all, if you're a Transformers fan in the least bit, Beast Wars is certainly worth a look, as it expands the Transformers mythos, and is an important chapter as well.",1196726400,,1661,5.245283018867925

1906031,5,B0000AGQ3M,"People say that everyone is wild on the inside, but I don't think that they had robots in mind. The ""Transformers"" are back and, in my opinion, better than ever! The Autobots and Decepticons are long gone.  This story is about their descendents, the smaller, but just as powerful, Maximals and Predicons. The Predicons steal an ancient Golden Disc from the Maximals and try to get away, but they are chased by a Maximal exploration ship. Both of the ships do battle and, during the battle, both are sent back in time millions of years. Both ships crash down onto a strange planet that looks like Earth, and even has the same animals that Earth has, but the planet has TWO moons! All Transformers, both Predicon and Maximal, survive the crash, but there is a problem. The planet is toxic to them and in order to survive, they scan the bodies of animals in the area and take their forms for protection. Now, both sides try desperately to destroy the other in a war for survival...a war for honor...a war of beasts.

1906033,4,B0000AGQ3M,"When this came out in the mid-90s, I was suprised to catch it on one of the local channels early sunday mornings.  Transformers were back, and at the time in really cool computer graphics.  The Maximals, decendents of the ancient autobots, and the Predicons, decendents of the ancient decepticons, battle it out on a remote planet (found later to be earth). It is a fun story line watching the first season as they adapt to this new world.  episodes 1-2 are tied together, then the other episodes are just kinda loose, no major storyline carried over episode to episode. As the season nears the end, and into the 2 and 3rd seasons, the stories get placed more into a continueing theme storyline. Looking at the computer animation now, it was kind of crude, even compared to the Beast machines episodes, but it was good at the time. So if you like the original transformers, I think you will addapt well to this cartoon series.  Check it out, still affordable here on amazon and easy to get a entire series cheap.",1169078400,2,1012,4.605555555555555
1906034,4,B0000AGQ3M,"BW was getting its feet under it in the first season. That was readily apparent in the voice talent getting a feel for its respective characters, and CGI errors that weren't made later on.

Still, the first season is very solid. It shows the characters thinking their way out of tight spots, dealing with the realities of war, and also includes links to the original Transformers series. (I.E., the appearance of Starscream, mentions of the ""Great War"", and so on.)

***Spoilers***

One of my personal favorite episodes is ""Dark Voyage."" It shows Rhinox, Cheetor, Rattrap and Dinobot rendered blind, damaged and low on power in an Energon explosion. Under attack from Waspinator and Terrorsaur, Rhinox has his team ""picture a targeting grid in your head, like the one we use in practice simulations."" Using this technique, Rhinox is able to tell his team where to fire, and fight off the Preds. A perfect example of using your head when the usual methods don't work.

I recommend this for any tran fan, old and new. The CGI might take some getting used to, particularly if you're used to conventional animation, but once you do, the show will definitely stand out.",1161302400,3,1164,4.834170854271357
1906035,5,B0000AGQ3M,"Back when this show came out I had fallen out of my Transformers fandom and just graduated from High School.  The original show had been long over and I never collected the comics so Transformers had just become another part of my childhood.  I remember being excited about a new Transformers show until I saw the previews and had the same reaction a lot of fans did - ""Optimus is a MUNKEEEY!?""  I never gave the show a chance.  Several years later, about last year to be exact I started re-watching G1 and my TF love returned.  Hungry for more I tentatively began looking into Beast Wars.  Finally I sucked it up and bought the first season, and boy am I glad.

The story starts several hundred years after G1 when two TF ships become stranded on an alien world.  Due to the overabundance of energon the bots must adapt a beast form to avoid ""energon overload.""  The two factions are the Maximals who are Autobot descendents and the Predacons, descended from the Decepticons of course.  Cybertron is officially at peace but factions within the Predacons are looking to plans of conquest.  The two groups take this conflict into a seemingly smaller scale when they become stranded on this alien world.

Due to the small number of characters on each side they got lots of development in the storyline.  Beast Wars encompasses the best of G1 with the tales of civil war, conflict, friendship, and fighting for what you believe in; whether it be freedom for all or conquest of all.  The stories were engaging and entertaining and there wasn't a single line that made me cringe.  The writers had little knowledge of G1 but pulled together a great show regardless.  The characters were exceptional, but still flawed and the writers did an excellent job of making the show entertaining for all ages.  The show also brought something that fans like me had been waiting for, strong female characters that weren't stereotyped or cast into background roles.

The CGI?  Well yes it's dated but it's well done and you can see that the animators took a lot of pride in their work.  It doesn't suffer from the flaws in animation that the G1 cartoon did.

Beast Wars is probably one of the best loved series in the fandom despite it's eyebrow raising premise.  I really believe that any fan of TFs could love this show, and many non-fans would as well.  It's just that well written.",1158451200,5,2367,4.637019230769231
1906036,5,B0000AGQ3M,"Entering college, I wanted to bring a few things from my childhood with me so that I wouldn't forget just who I was as a kiddie.  One of those things is Beast Wars.

When I bought it at Suncoast for ten dollars more than it is offered on Amazon, I was hesitant to open it, thinking, what if I really don't like this anymore?  As I watched, I fell in love with the same set of characters I had as a child.

I love the series more now than I did when I was eleven, and happily bought the second and third seasons to go with it.  I picked up on jokes I'd never heard before, understood some character development that went over my head, and even liked some characters that I previously did not.

The only people that I think have problems accepting this show is old Transformer fans who won't open their minds to something new--it's not a spinoff or an adaptation, it's a prelude AND and epilude.

When Optimus Primal reaches out and touches Optimus Prime, it sent chills down my spine.  When Dinobot died holding Rattraps hand, I had to pretend to be cleaning my glasses.  And I can honestly say Megatron is the only baddie that's ever given me the giggles.

I suggest buying this if you loved the series when it was first aired, if you're willing to open your eyes to something other than the originals, or if you're trying to get your kid away from B rated afterschool crap like Spongebob.",1154390400,4,1389,4.328185328185328
1906037,5,B0000AGQ3M,"Back in the late nineties, there were alot of kids shows around.  Some were good, Like War Planets, and Angry Beavers.  Others were okay, like Reboot.  Some I'd rather not remember, like most of the Anime being dubbed onto Cartoon Network.  One show though stood out above the rest, and imprinted on me like no book, tv show, or videogame has ever before, or since.  From the intro of the first episode when the Axalon and Darkside exited from transwarp space I was fixed.  This show was simply called Beast Wars.

The CGI graphics may not have been the best, but because of the complex characters that made up the cast you would have to look for flaws to find them.  There was humor as in episodes like, ""A Better Mousetrap,"" or ""The Low Road.""  There was action unequaled in any kids show at the time, or since, as in the episodes, ""Gorilla Warfare,"" or, ""Call of the Wild.""  There was well thought out plots like when Cheetor, Rattrap, Dinobot, and Rhinox were rendered blind in the episode, ""Dark Voyage.""  Also like in no other kidshow at the time, there was tradgedy.  The episode, ""Law of the Jungle,"" is really one of the, if not the first that dealt with death.  Sure other shows like DBZ may have shown it, but the characters always come back.  In Beast Wars, death is eternal, besides the a few incidents in the following seasons.

Each character has it's own thing to be admired about, Megatron for not only being a powerful villian, but an intellegent leader.  Optimus for never giving an order he would not follow himself.  Waspinator for his loyalty even after each time he was blown to bits.  Dinobot for not letting his Predacon heritage guide his way of life, and so on.

Also the characters are the first in a series to really question sensless violence.  The character Tigertron brings a reality to the horrors of war that never before were used in a kids show.

All in all, as I bring this review to an end I have to say that despite being labeled as a kids show, I find Beast Wars to be as much entertaining as it was then, as it is now.  Even more so now that I am old enough to really find much in common with the characters, and to understand why they did the things they did.  There has never been a show since, kids or adults, that brings all this together as it did before.  Thats why I strongly recomend Beast Wars, Season One as a must have dvd boxed set.  For anyone that loves transformers, and anyone that grew up with beliveing that someway somehow, good always trimuphs over evil.",1153267200,3,2515,4.427015250544662
1906038,5,B0000AGQ3M,My son is thrilled with this DVD!  We watch them all the time - a great series!,1152835200,,79,3.6470588235294117
1906039,5,B0000AGQ3M,"A funny thing has happened to a lot of the old Transformers fans as they have aged.  They have gotten young again.

By that I mean, they like to relive their childhood by hunting down the old cartoons and buying the old toys or perhaps buying some of the new toys and/or watching some of the new Transformers shows.  A lot of them do this because they now have the money to invest in Transformers that they didn't have as children and many also want to expose their own kids to something they grew up with.

However, a lot of old ""Transfans"" won't accept anything but the old toys and the old shows and aren't big fans at all of Aramada, Cybertron, Energon, etc.  Beast Wars however made quite a few converts.

Let me make it clear that this definitely isn't a direct continuation of the original cartoon and toy line.  Your first clue would be the animation when watching the shows.  It is known as CGI, meaning it is computer generated 3-D animation.  The first time I saw Transformers in CGI it was hard to adjust to, but after a few shows it seemed quite natural.

The second adjustment is the difference of the characters and the story.  For one, the main Transformers in the series don't turn into cars and planes and they aren't even Autobots and Decepticons.  Instead, this series focuses on the Maximals and Predacons, which are the descendants of the original heroes and villians many of us grew up with.

The plotlines themselves have a little something for everyone.  They appeal to kids because they do have a decent amount of humor and ""fun"" characters involved.  There is also a lot of classic good vs. evil, and the depth of the scripts is far greater than most would expect, yet there is enough action to make it enjoyable even for children who don't always understand all of the concepts.

Most importantly, the show manages to both stay true to the original G1 theme, while somehow expanding it and still maintaining it's very own unique identity.  Several G1 characters are either mentioned or make an appearance but them showing up doesn't steal the show, it just adds to the story and actually helps some of the regular characters develop.

Perhaps the best analogy I could use here is Star Trek compared to Star Trek - The Next Generation.  Both Beast Wars and TNG weren't afraid to be their own shows, but they certainly didn't forget where they came from either.  Both shows also attracted a whole new group of fans while winning over many fans of the originals.

If you decide to own just one Transformers DVD set, this would make a great choice.

If you want to check Beast Wars out without buying a complete season, look for the 10th Anniversary figures now available in stores.  If you are lucky enough to find the Waspinator figure, the DVD included with that figure, ""Possession"" is arguably the best of the entire series.

I have also reviewed Beast Machines and the original G1 cartoon so check out those reviews as well.",1149292800,4,2954,4.593511450381679

The stories and characters are very well set up in this long first season (twice as long as the following seasons).

The two most notable exceptions to this rule were AM radio (for sheer comedic value) and the prolific Beast Wars Transformers series. With excellent character intaraction and development, Beast Wars is more than simply a CG cartoon show.

1906047,5,B0000AGQ3M,"You've gotta give credit to the creators of Beast wars. This show potrays what it does best and that's making you laugh at the dimwited villains and bickering heros. Done quiet well for a CG aminated series, Best wars is certaintly one of the strangest spin off's in the Transformer's universe. The first episode (a two part arc) simply introduces the characters and their delima, the music isn't all that great unless you like blaring giutars and jungle-sounding music. It does have its moments though. After landing on a unknown planet the transformers learn that there is far too much energon (a sorce of energy they use to power their ships and cybertron) on the planet for their robitic bodies to handle so they simply find themselves ""beast modes"" to travel in and only use their ""Robot modes"" to do battle with their enemy.

Also their not called Autobots or Decpticons, instead their called ""Maximals"" and ""Predicons"" to cater to their animal forms and in each episode they search for energon to power their damaged ships in the hopes that they will be able to return to cybertron. The Maximals also search for their comrades that were sent into orbt when their exploration shuttle crahsed landed. The voice acting in the show in done very well, be warned there is only english aduio on this DVD and no extra features, but there are enough episodes (seven I believe) on each DVD keep you harping about that. The animations for the characters as execptionally great although it can be clunky at times. The plot is semi-complex and can get rather confusing as the show progesses but everything reveals itself in a very slow pace. Despite this beast wars is a great show, but jaded-twenty-something's will not be pleaseed by the fact that their animals instead of vehicles, but this shouldn't bother anyone with an open mind.",1116115200,,1830,4.809523809523809
1906048,5,B0000AGQ3M,"I was a huge fan of the Beast Wars back in late 1996/early 1997. The first season in my view was by far the best one of the three seasons, mainly because it's episodes were packed with mega-explosions and hilarious jokes. The explosions in the episodes were frequently massive planet shacking blasts that consisted of upto 4 or 5 tremendous explosions one after the other. Man when an energon crystal explodes, YOU BETTER BE READY TO RUN LIKE HECK!!

Like I mentioned above, many of the episodes also contained hysterical jokes. One episode in particular had me cracking up hysterically when I first watched it back in Febuary of '97. The episode titled ""The Low Road"" was by far the funniest episode of the entire season...NO THE ENTIRE SERIES!!!!! Prior to that episode, I had never laughed so hard... or so much... AT ONE EPISODE! I don't mean to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, but towards the end of the episode there is a scene where Rhinox blows a fart. As if just having Rhinox blow a fart wasn't funny enough on it's own, the producers added two facters to top it all off.

1) Rhinox lets the fart go in Megatron's face (litterally)!

2) The fart is so huge that it is visible from outer space!

And as if that isn't enough, Megatron realizes that Rhinox is going to blow a fart, right at the very last second before it happens. One final note, in ""The Low Road"" the episode's final scene starts with a close up view of Megatron's face, then the camera zooms out to show that he and the rest of the Predicons are hanging upside-down from the branches of a dead tree. As the Camera zooms out Megatron says something. I will not reveal what he says (don't want to spoil it for you), but pay close attention to his comment.

1906050,4,B0000AGQ3M,"One of my favorite series to watch when I was younger, I was very pleased to see it come out on DVD. The first season is even better then I remember with a great combination of character development, humor, and action. The voice acting and visual presentation is great, though a bit rocky from the start. Beast Wars had a lot of firsts in the world of animation so one could only expect a few problems, though there aren't any by the end of this season.

On the episodes contained in this box set you get to see how it all started. You get to see each and every character's personality change as rivalries evolve and the plot twists more and more. Memmorable episodes include Rhynox nearly destroying the Predacons when he was turned into one, Dinobot's duel with Optimus Primal, the return of Starscream (my favorite G1 character), and what the thrilling finale where the transformers dealt with the wrath of the alien beings that haunted the back of their minds.

All this greatness and there are still two more seasons worth. Getting this box set is worth being a good introduction to the series and it's characters if nothing else and is a must to complete the collection. The only part I consider myself a bit of a downside is that it was made by people that hated transformers themselves.

Well, the CG work for Season One, at least the first 7 eps. seems fairly dated and yet STILL has some particularly beautiful moments. The bot transformation are still a marvel to see and yeah, the backdrops are often sparse, and yet I still BELIEVE they exist for the sake of the characters, which for me is a must. There is something about this series that really makes me feel as though I am watching 'true pioneering' through the CG work. Like everything I'm seeing was made from a labor of love and is truly unique.

So many clever plot points injected right from the beginning: Dinobot 'the traitor' being a Maximal always has an edge to his presence; the orbiting stasis pods with the remaining crew orbiting the planet that can 'drop in' at any time; the fact they have to remain in beast mode but CAN change into robot form for short bursts is just pure genius.

The voice acting and character development on the first 7 episodes is actually beyond what I hoped. Easily taking up the slack for some of the dated visuals...

This for me, so far is a slam dunk purchase and the characters have that sort of instant chemistry that isn't forced. Some of the Predicons are annoying but alls fair in love and Beast Wars, eh??

I bought Season Two also but kept it wrapped up just in case this one wasn't worth beans, but it looks like I'm keeping both and making a mighty fine Burrito:), b/c the general word is that the 1st season is the worst season...!! Can't wait to see Season Two!!",1095984000,8,1715,4.3974763406940065

Great plot points and changes. Surprises at every turn. Great show.  Highly recommended if you don't mind the 90's CG editing.  Seasons 2 and 3 show much better CG.

You are not sure if the series wants to be a childrens show or a nostalgic flash back to the generration one charcters.  However the series decides not to pander to childer and instead starts to make several incredible decisions about the series.

1.  It will be set up for adults.  As such characters will die.

2.  Moral issues will be faught and sometimes good will do ""evil"" acts to survive.

3.  Every episode will build on each other.  Their is an incredible continuity that is started in season one.  This continuity is carried all the way into season three.

4.  Scale, reality, and believable sci-fi are present in the show.  Things happen due to a scientific reason.  This may be a fantastical science as we see but they still make the show as hard edged as possible.

All in all a great season.

It didn't help that I never caught the show's initial run in order or that i only occasionaly saw an espoisode now & then, so the plots/characters never seemed to make sense.
Only after watching the original G1 series on DVD I noticed the glaring difference in quality. I realized that the G1 series were just glorified toy commericals, but Beast wars had high quality writers, very good story lines, and highly interesting charcters/charcter interactions, Beast Wars was a real program. There was also the minor things that bugged me from the originals that were fixed with Beast Wars, like when they transformed they were relative to their size, NO changing size (small item to huge robot) to fit the show/toy line. There were many tie ins with the original series including a special guest apparence of three decepticons in diffent episodes.
The CGI animation was good for mid 90's, bright, clear colors with shimmering metallic surfaces show thru excellent on DVD (that's on only a stero TV, on HDTV it's heaven). A waste that the environment was bland & rather empty. The animals didn't appeal to me at first, but when u thought about it, it ended up fitting into the story better.  Then there's none of those ANNOYING humans that wear only one set of clothes and have the transformers alway having to save them from terrible situations they make for themselves.
I was disappointed that there is no subtitles or language options. The menu interface is rather cumbersome to select things. Then for those that care, there are barely any extras like the faces behind the voices or staff caring on with blah blah blah...
I purchased this DVD set and anxiously anticipate the rest of the episodes of Beast Wars and Beast Machines!!!",1080777600,3,1871,4.846875
1906059,5,B0000AGQ3M,"Finally finally finally, someone listens to our begs and pleas to bring this great series to DVD.  Rhino, I applaud you.  Obviously this is the longest collection of all three seasons, and this is the root for the much more exciting and plot twisted second & third seasons.
Every episode is well crafted, wasn't bored with anyone of them.  My favorite Cybertronian of course, is Optimus Primal.  I just wish he would have used his power to its full potential like he did in ""Gorilla Warfare"".  Which was one of my favorites episodes from the first season.  If you loved Transformers from the past, then you gotta get this and see what their descendents have started.  Get this right away!!",1080172800,,689,4.691666666666666
1906060,5,B0000AGQ3M,"It's about time that this show was put on season sets instead of those volumes with only six episodes each. Anyway this series is a followup to G1 Transformers from the 1980's and takes place approximately three centuries later. I first heard of this show back in 1998 when I was fifteen, I watched one episode and was hooked. Even now that I'm almost twenty this show still holds the same effect for me as it did then. I recorded 46 out of 52 total episodes off of TV, but now that they're on DVD I can get rid of my six year old videos with their horrible sound and picture. The picture quality is fantastic, especially compared to broadcast quality, the 5.1 sound is great too, like during the battle sequences. As far as the stories go they're great with only a few exceptions. IMHO every episode is worth watching however some are marred by too much slap-stick comedy, but oh well. This season is mostly more light hearted then the second season, ""Code Of Hero"" would be a good example of the darker 2nd season episodes. This season establishes the beginnings of the alien story arc which culminates in the second and third seasons. There are numerous references to the 1980's transformers series starting in the first episode, one G1 character makes an actual appearance in the episode ""Possession"". There isn't much in the way of special features there are two interviews with Larry DiTillo and Bob Forward. But I could care less. Having this great series on DVD brings back all those great memories. Definately worth buying. I look forward to the second and third seasons coming out as well as Beast Machines.",1074729600,9,1617,4.6573426573426575
1906061,5,B0000AGQ3M,"When I was little my cousins gave me some of their old transformers, and a got some of the Gen 2 toys, while i was watching the second run, of the original series. after awhile i fadded from transformers, until one day I turned on Beast Wars and I fell in love again. I was absolutely crazed over this show (and line of figures). I had taped most of the episodes, but over time they were ither lost or taped over. I pretty much lost contact with it...again, but as I slowy turned back into it, and found this dvd i was thrilled. Even though it has little extras I'm still thankfull Rhino made it, and i'm ever waiting the other 2 seasons",1072656000,,637,4.186991869918699
1906062,5,B0000AGQ3M,"Just a quick technical issue resolution before I head off for tax class.
For those that bought this set during its first printing, you may notice that the DD 5.1 Surround track on Ep. 1 ""Beast Wars, part 1"" and Ep. 5 ""Chain of Command"", all on Disc 1 have snaps and popping noises through-out them.
Well, Rhino Customer Service is aware (through me, actually) of this apparent release-wide problem and will sometime in the near future print up and offer fixed replacement discs.
All one needs to do is to contact Rhino's customer service rep, Mack Dunlop at 1-800-546-3670, and he'll put you on a list to call when they're ready to ship the replacements.
On a side note, I have asked him when he expects Season 2 & 3 to be released and currently it's not on their production schedule, but he expects that maybe by Summer 2004.",1070928000,14,826,4.513333333333334
1906063,5,B0000AGQ3M,"When Beast Wars first came out, I was in middle school and at the wonderful age where I had judged myself too old for such things as ""Beast Wars"" and ""Transformers.""  So I missed out on perhaps one of the best science fiction shows of the 90s.
About the 11th grade, I determined I didn't give a rip if anybody cared if I still liked Transformers, but by that time, Beast Wars was gone, and had been replaced with the questionable Beast Machines.  I read up on the Beast Wars, though, intrigued by what I had missed.
So when Rhino released the first season, I bought it as soon as I could find a copy.  I was not disappointed.
The episodes are all well-made, and the story writing is also well done (except for the episode ""The Low Road;"" ugh.)  My personal favorite episode is ""Possession"" which features the return of original Transformers character, Starscream!  Another top-notch episode is ""Law of the Jungle,"" which has a surprisingly mature look at death, sacrifice, duty, and honor.
Basically, everybody in the family can enjoy ""Beast Wars""--there's enough technobabble for hardcore Sci-fi fans, humor for the kids, and plenty of action and adventure throughout.",1070150400,4,1169,4.796019900497512
1906064,5,B0000AGQ3M,"I grew up watching G1 and i had many of the original toys. Now that Im 22 I know the cartoon was just a glorified comercial to sell the toys. Don't get my wrong i still loved them and own the new boxed sets and enjoyed watching every moment of them. Well when Beast Wars came out when I was in high school I started watching it not really expecting much, But to my suprise the Computer animation was beautiful and the stories were great. I mean with the noble Primal, the wise guy Rattrap, the brash young Cheetor, the wise Rhinox and a confused warrior Dinobot, all well written charaters I loved them all, along with a few others that show up thought out season 1. the Show only got better with the age as season 2 introduced the transmetals and fuzors. the only thing i disliked about the whole run was how they ended it with season 3. it seems too rushed as they tried to tie up all ther loose ends(Tigerhawk is one example)... If you like Adventure, great characters, good stories and amazing animation you need this box set. You don't need to be a fan of transformers to jump into this show and enjoy every minute of it. I own this set and cannot wait for them to realease season 2 and 3. This is hands down the best show that ever represented Transformers",1068076800,3,1262,4.2845188284518825
1906065,5,B0000AGQ3M,It's about time the TV series came out in a complete edition. Beast Wars is a fantastic CG journey through the transformer world. I have waited a long time to see the complete collection of early episodes and look forward to the remaining seasons. This is a great video product for anyone who is a fanatic of Cinema Graphics. The creators have done well I hope in the future we'll see more of these kind of videos.,1066953600,,414,4.3896103896103895
1906066,5,B0000AGQ3M,"This is easily one of my favorites TV shows ever.
This is a really well written series, with a great ongoing sci-fi plot and enjoyable characters.
The voice actors are superb!!! The 3D animation is great and always improving.
The only dissapointed are the few extras (only 2 interviews with the writers) and interview with voice actors from a different transformers cartoon series (I don't know how this fits on this DVD set.)
Give this DVD a shot, it is NOT a dumbed down cartoon for kids!",1065744000,2,490,4.64367816091954
1906067,5,B0000AGQ3M,BEAST WARS HAS BEEN MY FAVORITE SHOW IN THE WORLD SINCE IT CAME OUT.  THESE ARE ONE OF THE BEST EPISODES MADE AND I HOPE THAT THEY KEEP MAKING THE BEAST WARS FOR DVD THAT WAY I COULD GET THEM TO MY COLLECTION.  THERES ONLY THREE SEASONS AND I AM HOPING THAT THEY MAKE EVERY ONE OF THEM.,1063497600,2,286,3.913793103448276
1906068,3,B0000AGQ3M,"Even though I love the original Transformers the best, I liked this series mostly because of the voice actors and I was very disappointed that there were no interviews with the actors, which is why the lower rating!!  Or at least have a behind the scenes look at how the series was made!!  Other than my disappointment with the extras, it's nice to have the series on Dvd.  Hopefully Beast Machines will be released in the futre as well.",1062460800,,437,4.506329113924051
7997115,5,B0000AGQ3M,"This is a great box set, I think beast wars is way better than the original transformers series, it is more engaging and the story lines are more Sci-Fi, the characters are have more depth and the story lines are way more thought provoking, adults would enjoy the series as well, I have the original transformers complete DVD set as well and though i think the original transformers are also pretty good, there are times (as an adult) where i feel that the original series is a little boring and not as interesting in its story lines (I mean makes sense because it was designed for children) but this series never really felt that way the beast wars is awesome and ties in the original transformers time line into this series in a really cool way, check out the series online, as for this box set i purchased it and i think its a good one I know there is a newer one out as well that is cheaper",1514160000,,894,4.295857988165681

The box had very minimal wear and tear not in perfect condition but still in good shape. The only reason I didn't give this product a 5 was the sticker they put on the case to keep it from not opening, when I removed the sticker it took some of the cover with it.

7997122,5,B0000AGQ3M,"One of my all time favorite Transformers series, despite of it not having Shockwave in it. The storyline is detailed and fascinating, complexing the characters story and personality. This isn't your typical TF series. It even expands the TF mytho and legend from the original first generation of Transformers. Both new generation of Transformer fans and older ones would really enjoy and appreciate this series.",1418688000,,411,5.338461538461538
7997123,5,B0000AGQ3M,"What can I say? Beast Wars is awesome! It is one of the best continuities of the Transformers universe. From it's hokey humor, to it's genuinely intense, and even touching moments, this is a show that both children and adults can easily enjoy. I say this, because I actually grew up watching BW, and now as a mature adult can still enjoy it!

I love all of the characters in this series, both the bad and the good. Each character has their own personality, and set of morals, and perspectives- they aren't just a rack of cardboard cut-outs that spouted one-liners. Well, maybe sometimes they did... but it was done in moderation, and didn't sound forced, or overdone, and the characters are so memorable and well written that you don't notice it. The show was a balanced mix of silliness, and seriousness. When it wanted to be funny, it could be funny, when it wanted to be serious, it was stone-cold serious. You didn't feel jerked around or out of place, whenever it would switch, because that's just how BW rolled. It didn't feel weird when it had a humorous moment, any more than it did when it had a serious moment. There have even been some genuinely sad moments in it as well. Like tear-jerking sad moments, and that is rare to see in kid shows.

The CGI is of course very dated, but at the time it was very impressive, and while it didn't age very well, it somehow adds to the flare of this show for me. I know that may not make sense to some, but I guess you could say this show's out-dated animation style, is truly timeless, much like the original G1 Transformers show's out-dated animation is timeless. It's all a matter of perspective.

I can't guarantee everyone will like this show, as it did take some very different turns from the traditional Transformers, but personally I think the series is a masterpiece. If you are a new Transformers fan, I recommend you at least give this series a chance and watch the first season. If you are a parent, and want to expose your children to some awesome shows of the past, then buy this. They will love it, and you may even come to love it too!",1417564800,,2100,4.44935064935065
7997124,5,B0000AGQ3M,What can you not like about Beast Wars!! Amazing show and even my kids now watch it with me when I put it on! This one hits all groups!
