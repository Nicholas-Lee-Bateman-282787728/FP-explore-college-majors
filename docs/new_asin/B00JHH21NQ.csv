This is very similar to previous countdown sets where the incidents picked & order they are in won't please everyone so you just have to take it for strictly entertainment as it has no relevance outside of this DVD set with each segment showcasing each incident with various comments from talents with their comments (some serious & others not so much depending on the tone of the moment) with such names as William Regal, Bill Demont, Dusty Rhodes, Cody Rhodes, Finlay, Justin Roberts, Jim Duggan, Arn Anderson, Terry Taylor, Hulk Hogan, Natayla, Dean Ambrose, Tony Schavonie, Ultimate Warrior, Booker T, Gene Okerland, Goldust, Michael Hayes, Vince Russo, Billy Kidman, Ric Flair, Goldberg, Chris Jericho, Rey Mysterio, Beth Phoenix, Jimmy Hart, C.M.

Matches Include:
Scaffold Match: Road Warriors vs. Midnight Express - It wasn't known at the time but Hawk came into this match with a cracked bone in his lower leg while the scaffold itself wasn't put together as safely as possible as you saw pieces of the railing coming part when the teams were climbing up the cage. With the action happened on top of a scaffold where it very limited in space, the action was reduced to nothing more than brawling & power strikes with powder being used as a weapon while both teams where also fighting on the bottom of the scaffold hanging off it like monkey bars & even one man swinging off this opponents legs at one point but what was more memorable about this match was the aftermath when one man took the fall off the scaffold that still effects the victim to this day.

[Road Warriors; Starrcade: The Essential Collection]

Chamber Of Horrors Match: Sting, El Gigante, Steiner Brothers vs. Big Van Vader, Diamond Studd, Cactus Jack, Abdullah The Butcher - This match was a first (and only) match of it's kind as it was held inside the Thunderdome/Thundercage steel cage that also encloses the ringside area along with the ring an electric ""Chair Of Torture"" being lowered to the inside of the ring with the way to win the match being to put a member of the opposing team into the chair & flip the switch on the side of the cage to electrocute them while it should also be noted that this was Scott Steiner's first match back from his arm injury months earlier & also debuted what was known as the ""refer-eye camera"" where the referee was wearing a helmet with a camera on it so you could see the match from his point of view as well. There was non-stop brawling all over the place With all of these men enclosed inside the cage including such moments as caskets filled with masked men to attack the wrestlers, various weapons used including kendo sticks & pieces of the broken caskets leading to some people bleeding, who was put into the chair & who actually flipped the switch, and the post-match attack on the zombies waiting on the ramp with a stretcher leading to Tony Schavonie saying the infamous line, ""I guess when he opened his eyes he thought he was in heaven & knew he shouldn't be there."" This was one of those matches that may have looked good in Dusty Rhodes' mind but was ""car crash ugly"" when executed in that you knew wasn't going to be pretty but you had to see it to believe it.

Cactus Jack vs. Big Van Vader - This was the rematch after Cactus scored a count out victory over Vader the previous week (seen on Mick Foley's ""Greatest Hits & Misses"") with Cactus coming into the match showing the effects of their previous encounter with his broken nose heavily taped. Cactus wasted taking the fight not only to Vader brawling from ringside to the entrance way using chairs & the guardrail but also getting his shots in Harley Race taking him down on more than one occasion as well the point where the referee had to keep pulling Cactus back before Vader was able to get the advantage with multiple heavy blows to the head area & using his size to his advantage catching Cactus & dropping his entire weight on different parts of his body as the match eventually got taken back to the floor with Race giving instructions that showed Vader wasn't out to just win a match with it ultimately resulting in one man being taken out on a stretcher into an ambulance.
""WCW Saturday Night"" Apr 93

King Of The Road Match: Dustin Rhodes vs. Blacktop Bully - Another first (and only) match of it's kind in not just WCW but wrestling history as both men were fighting on the flatbed of an 18 wheeler diesel truck in motion enclosed in chicken wire with a helicopter & truck on the side of the flatbed capturing all the action with the object of the match being to fight from the back to the front & blow the blow horn at the top of the post. This was nothing more than a brawl with both men being knocked off balance various times due to the momentum of the truck starting & stopping for turns & stops while pieces of wood falling off the truck breaking on the road as they were using whatever they could get their hands on use such as bails of hay & a horse trough with both men bleeding. This was another one of those matches that may have looked good on paper but was not only ""car crash ugly"" but very dangerous as well fighting in that type of environment.

Sumo Monster Truck Match: Hulk Hogan vs. Giant - After Giant tormented Hogan for weeks using his monster truck to destroy Hogan's Harley Davidson motorcycle that Hogan decided to fight with a monster truck of his own leading to this match where both trucks were welded together & had a sumo-type match over on Cobo Hall with the winner being able to push the losers truck out the of watered down circle. This really wasn't much to watch unless your a huge fan of monster trucks but the bigger story was what happened after the match that would lead into...

WCW Champion Hulk Hogan vs. Giant - ...this match later in the night in what was Giant's debut match which began with Hogan in complete shock that he arrived after what physically happened between both men minutes earlier after the monster truck match. Hogan was dressed in black from head to toe along with his head painted with the same symbols as ""Taskmaster"" Kevin Sullivan to showcase that he went to the ""darkside"" in order to fight the Dungeon Of Doom (months before he once again wore black as nWo's ""Hollywood Hogan"") as Hogan attempted to do whatever he could to take Giant down to no avail only to get beaten & worn down for several minutes before finally ""Hulking Up"" & overpower Giant including reliving the famous moment with years earlier in that same area with Andre The Giant through ""his son"" before all hell breaks loose as you find out who were Hogan's true friends & enemies along with the infamous appearance of the Yeti that lead to not only one of the most unintentionally awkward moments in wrestling history but also a history making championship match.

Sting, Lex Luger, Randy Savage vs. The Outsiders - This match was subtitled ""The Hostile Takeover"" as this was ""The Outsiders"" in-ring debut after appearing on WCW's television shows for weeks. It should also be noted that this was suppose to be a six man tag with WCW's team against Hall & Nash with a mystery partner only for Hall & Nash to go it alone & Luger being knocked out in the opening minutes making this a regular tag team match. This was a good tag team match with each man playing to their strengths (Nash's size & power, Sting & Hall's in-ring ability, Savage's unpredictability) along with Hall & Nash doing the classic ""double teaming behind the referee's back"" tactics various times. The ending with Hulk Hogan transforming into Hollywood Hogan & the birth of the nWo became one of the most infamous moments in wrestling history.

La Parka vs. Randy Savage - For those who don't remember, Larry Zbyszko would normally commentate on the first half of Nitro while Bobby Heenan would do the second half but Zbyszko stuck around due to a confrontation earlier in the night with Scott Hall & Randy Savage. Hall & Elizabeth would come out with Savage who all kept taunting Zbyszko at the announce table before going to the ring for the match before later Hall would once again go back to the announce table taking his eye off Savage's match while Savage would be ""one upped"" inside the ring. This was more about pushing the storyline involving Hall & Savage going into the Bash At The Beach PPV more than anything else but still a nice ""shocking"" moment for that time.

WCW Champion Hollywood Hogan vs. Goldberg - Goldberg started out with a side headlock followed by powering Hogan down with moves like a shoulder block & test of strength causing Hogan to resort to tactics like using his weightbelt & a low blow then showcasing his own strength with a clothesline that took Goldberg down before taking the match to the outside using the guardrail & steel chair but Goldberg wouldn't be denied as he kept rolling out of the way when Hogan went to drop his elbows & even kicked out of his trademark moves resulting in some assistance coming out for Hogan but ultimately backfiring on him. This was the match that many consider the apex of WCW in the ""Monday Night Wars"" as this was the match that definitely cemented Goldberg as not only the new top man in the company & his spot as a memorable name in wrestling.

Human Torch Match: Sting vs. Vampiro - The torch was set at the top of ""Nitrovision"" (their entrance way screen) with both men starting the fight in the ring continuing the brawl from ringside with one man ending up completely soaked in gasoline to the stage area eventually making it's way to the top of the screen where they continued to fight with Sting's lightning effects used for his entrance going on for minutes making it hard to see what was going on before you saw one man completely lit on fire. The match wasn't much past a brawl as it was all about nothing else than the one participant being set on fire.
Great American Bash 00

WCW Champion Jeff Jarrett vs. Kevin Nash - It should be noted that Jarrett was the crown jewel of the Eric Bischoff & Vince Russo's New Blood group while fellow member & commissioner The Cat made the announcement to have himself & members of the Filthy Animals as special officials & ringside attendants for this match. Nash was dominate early on including taking the fight to Jarrett in the crowd before Jarrett was able to focus on Nash's knee with weapons & various submissions along with having some assistance that Nash kept attempting to fight off while evening the odds with a weapon of his own as the action was getting out of control with the referees & anyone else trying to get involved in the match getting taken out in one way or another before one man decided to not only ""surprise"" one of the participants but the entire landscape of WCW.

Judy Bagwell On A Forklift Match: Buff Bagwell vs. Kanyon - It was during this time that Chris Kanyon's persona was a clone of Diamond Dallas Page called ""Positively Kanyon"" to the point where he wanted Buff's mother as his ""Kimberly"" leading to this match where the winner would get the services of his mother with Judy Bagwell being tired to a forklift throughout the match since Kanyon ""couldn't find a pole big enough to hold that battleaxe."" Both men started the match fighting in the crowd before coming back into the ring trading momentum throughout the contest with not only Judy Bagwell continuing to yell explicit language leading to Scott Hudson saying, ""thank god she's not wearing a mic"" while also getting a special appearance from a former WCW Champion in what was just a solid match.
New Blood Rising 00

Steel Cage Match: WCW Champion Booker T vs. Vince Russo - This is the infamous match where after seeing the disaster that ""David Arquette: WCW Champion"" was for WCW that it was decided that Vince Russo himself could be WCW Champion as this match was ""wrestlecrap"" at it's best as it was just full of constant run-ins & interference from Ric Flair, Sting, Goldberg, Scott Steiner, a surprise appearance from another top star who was previously missing for months and what seems like half the roster in a match that was just completely overbooked (typical of that time) from start to finish with very unfunny commentary.
""Nitro"" Sep 00
[Legends Of Wrestling: Heatseekers]

WCW Championship/San Francisco 49ers Match: Booker T vs. Jeff Jarrett - Russo vacated the championship earlier in the night leading to this match where there were four boxes hanging on individual poles located in each corner of the ring with each one having a different item with the object of the match to remove the WCW Championship from it's box. The match started with a quick attack on the floor that made a fan very angry before the match got back in the ring with the first box falling off the pole within the opening minute that was typical ""Russo"" with the second box being opened that was definitely made the crowd go ""Hey Yo!"" as they fight between the two once again made it's way to the outside with the ringside environment coming into play including using the opened boxes & what was contained in the third box as a weapon as both men traded momentum before eventually working their way to the forth box containing the championship. Jarrett & Booker always had good chemistry together but with all the attempts at entertainment including who decided to make an appearance & some of the boxes malfunctioning definitely hurt more than helped the match so it was good as it could be.

(Blu-Ray) Cruiserweight Battle Royal with the winner facing WCW Crusierweight Champion Chris Jericho - This match was to determine who would challenge Jericho for the Crusierweight Title right after with Jericho giving his own twist on ring announcing the participants. With this match being filled with crusierweights, there was more high flying than usual in his type of match but the ending was the real shocker as it was down to Juventud Guerrera & Ciclope when Juvi decided to eliminate himself in order to give Ciclope the win who then unmasked to reveal himself to be the one man Jericho didn't want to see who attacked Jericho with more aggression & anger than we've ever seen from him before.
Slamboree 98

(Blu-Ray) Junkyard Invitational Battle Royal Match - The back story behind this match was that WCW President Ric Flair had banned all hardcore matches from WCW arenas leading to Hak issuing a challenge for a hardcore invitational in a junkyard with the only way to win being to escape over the fence. This match saw various talents from the regular competitors of the hardcore division to other WCW talents such as the luchadors & even some returning faces that saw such scenes as a car being turned over in the opening seconds, wrestlers brawling on the top of hoods & trunks, bodies being thrown into cars including one person being stuffed into the trunk with bad intentions, explosions, and various weapons used from electrical wire to trash cans to different parts of the cars themselves as ultimately this match resulted in a bunch of injuries making this one of those WCW matches that was once in a lifetime.
Bash At The Beach 99

(Blu-Ray) Pinata On A Pole Match: Silver King vs. Juventud Guerrera vs. El Dandy vs. Psychosis vs. Villano V - ""The Powers That Be"" placed a check for $10,000 inside the pinata with each luchador supplied with a stick to break it open only for the pinata to fall off the pole to the ground in the opening seconds as the in-ring action itself was your typical lucha spots but the bigger story here was the appearance of ""Dr. Death"" Steve Williams & the infamous ""Oklahoma"" character on commentary that was a parody of Jim Ross from his commentary style to his bells palsy influenced facial expressions.
""Nitro"" Nov 99

(Blu-Ray) Ready To Rumble Cage Match: WCW Champion David Arquette vs. Diamond Dallas Page vs. Jeff Jarrett - This was a three tear cage with each high level of the cage being smaller than the previous one. The first one was a cage that not only covered the ring but the outside area as well (similar to WWE's Hell In The Cell) with the next level up being the size of a normal ring size steel cage with hardcore weapons inside and the final level being a small room with four guitars hanging inside. Anyways, I don't want to explain the story behind Arquette being the WCW Champion because I feel so stupid for remembering how it happened so the less said, the better. Arquette wasn't even a major factor here as Jarrett was chasing him in the beginning only for DDP to catch him & lay into Jarrett while Arquette stayed out of the way & headed to the top of the cage to hold off anyone else from the New Blood getting the belt for Jarrett. Although DDP & Jarrett have good chemistry together, this match was mostly a brawl with them fighting it out on the first level & getting hardcore on the second level with a scary moment happening when they broke through one of the cage walls. Mike Awesome interfered but was taken out by DDP before they went to the third level guitar room...and had David Arquette hit DDP with a guitar to help Jarrett win back the WCW Championship with Kaynon coming out in the end to help DDP only for him to take a dive off the top of the cage similar to the one that Mankind took off Hell In The Cell 2 years earlier. In the history of WCW, they've used this cage structure around 4 different times and this was the best match in that environment as was actually a very good main event.

(Blu-Ray) United States Champion Lance Storm vs. General Rection - Lance Storm not only came into this match with the renamed ""Canadian"" Championship but also Major Gunns as a hostage due to a victory weeks earlier while Jim Duggan served as the outside official. Rection was dominate using his size & strength while also going strictly off aggression causing Storm to resort to desperate tactics & using his various styles of kicks along with showing athleticism but Rection was able to keep catching Storm & continued to showcase his aggression with Duggan being forced to get involved in the action but not in the way anyone expected.

The match started with a quick attack on the floor that made a fan very angry before the match got back in the ring with the first box falling off the pole within the opening minute that was typical ""Russo"" with the second box being opened that was definitely made the crowd go ""Hey Yo!"" as they fight between the two once again made it's way to the outside with the ringside environment coming into play including using the opened boxes & what was contained in the third box as a weapon as both men traded momentum before eventually working their way to the forth box containing the championship.  Jarrett & Booker always had good chemistry together but with all the attempts at entertainment including who decided to make an appearance & some of the boxes malfunctioning definitely hurt more than helped the match so it was good as it could be.

(Blu-Ray) Cruiserweight Battle Royal with the winner facing WCW Crusierweight Champion Chris Jericho - This match was to determine who would challenge Jericho for the Crusierweight Title right after with Jericho giving his own twist on ring announcing the participants. With this match being filled with crusierweights, there was more high flying than usual in his type of match but the ending was the real shocker as it was down to Juventud Guerrera & Ciclope when Juvi decided to eliminate himself in order to give Ciclope the win who then unmasked to reveal himself to be the one man Jericho didn't want to see who attacked Jericho with more aggression & anger than we've ever seen from him before.

(Blu-Ray) Junkyard Invitational Battle Royal Match - The back story behind this match was that WCW President Ric Flair had banned all hardcore matches from WCW arenas leading to Hak issuing a challenge for a hardcore invitational in a junkyard with the only way to win being to escape over the fence.  This match saw various talents from the regular competitors of the hardcore division to other WCW talents such as the luchadors & even some returning faces that saw such scenes as a car being turned over in the opening seconds, wrestlers brawling on the top of hoods & trunks, bodies being thrown into cars including one person being stuffed into the trunk with bad intentions, explosions, and various weapons used from electrical wire to trash cans to different parts of the cars themselves as ultimately this match resulted in a bunch of injuries making this one of those WCW matches that was once in a lifetime.

(Blu-Ray) Pinata On A Pole Match: Silver King vs. Juventud Guerrera vs. El Dandy vs. Psychosis vs. Villano V - ""The Powers That Be"" placed a check for $10,000 inside the pinata with each luchador supplied with a stick to break it open only for the pinata to fall off the pole to the ground in the opening seconds as the in-ring action itself was your typical lucha spots but the bigger story here was the appearance of ""Dr. Death"" Steve Williams & the infamous ""Oklahoma"" character on commentary that was a parody of Jim Ross from his commentary style to his bells palsy influenced facial expressions.
""Nitro"" Nov 99

(Blu-Ray) Ready To Rumble Cage Match: WCW Champion David Arquette vs. Diamond Dallas Page vs. Jeff Jarrett - This was a three tear cage with each high level of the cage being smaller than the previous one. The first one was a cage that not only covered the ring but the outside area as well (similar to WWE's Hell In The Cell) with the next level up being the size of a normal ring size steel cage with hardcore weapons inside and the final level being a small room with four guitars hanging inside. Anyways, I don't want to explain the story behind Arquette being the WCW Champion because I feel so stupid for remembering how it happened so the less said, the better. Arquette wasn't even a major factor here as Jarrett was chasing him in the beginning only for DDP to catch him & lay into Jarrett while Arquette stayed out of the way & headed to the top of the cage to hold off anyone else from the New Blood getting the belt for Jarrett. Although DDP & Jarrett have good chemistry together, this match was mostly a brawl with them fighting it out on the first level & getting hardcore on the second level with a scary moment happening when they broke through one of the cage walls. Mike Awesome interfered but was taken out by DDP before they went to the third level guitar room...and had David Arquette hit DDP with a guitar to help Jarrett win back the WCW Championship with Kaynon coming out in the end to help DDP only for him to take a dive off the top of the cage similar to the one that Mankind took off Hell In The Cell 2 years earlier. In the history of WCW, they've used this cage structure around 4 different times and this was the best match in that environment as was actually a very good main event.

(Blu-Ray) United States Champion Lance Storm vs. General Rection - Lance Storm not only came into this match with the renamed ""Canadian"" Championship but also Major Gunns as a hostage due to a victory weeks earlier while Jim Duggan served as the outside official.  Rection was dominate using his size & strength while also going strictly off aggression causing Storm to resort to desperate tactics & using his various styles of kicks along with showing athleticism but Rection was able to keep catching Storm & continued to showcase his aggression with Duggan being forced to get involved in the action but not in the way anyone expected.

I was more entertained by this presentation more than the previous WWE countdown as I'm glad incidents from the different eras (Jim Crockett Promotions/early WCW/Monday Night War era) were spread all throughout the countdown from top to bottom resulting in a good highlight reel which was the point of this presentation so it's something I would recommend.",1407369600,4,20377,4.6549902696691685
6358420,3,B00JHH21NQ,"If you have WWE Network or go on YouTube then you seen the stuff on this DVD a hundred times. I finished watching this one a few days ago and yeah it's fun to watch but I seen everything on this DVD so many times. This one though is a little different from the first OMG. This one does show some moments from ladder matches ect ect but it also shows The Shock Master...
How many times have we seen this? It was funny the first 100 times but now it's boring..
I also noticed they don't really show anything cool that happened in WCW, instead they show embarrassing stuff.
It was as if they want to show you how stupid WCW was..
Overall it was a fun watch but something you can really only watch once and everything you will see you have seen so many times already",1407283200,,762,4.120805369127517
6358421,5,B00JHH21NQ,"Another great WCW Release. WCW had it's share of Ups and Downs. It had The Highest High In The NWO. The Lowest Low in Dewey winning The WCW Title. This DVD covers all the most shocking moments in WCW. One that I thought was awesome was when The Ultimate Warrior R.I.P. showed up on WCW Nitro to fight Hogan. It was too bad he didn't go on to wrestle Goldberg or Macho Man but for the brief time he was there was awesome. Another moment was when they turned Goldberg Heel I thought it was great though it ultimately didn't work. It was something different and an effort to get better.

  The Goldberg spearing Bret Hart with the Metal Plate was classic. Sadly that was one of the few good moments in Bret Hart's WCW career. The FingerPoke of Doom definitely was a turning point as the shift went to WWF winning from then on. It was a mistake that proved WCW costly. Another great moment was Chris Jericho. He was an awesome wrestler that added extra comic relief and support to an already awesome show. The classic NWO mocking 4 horseman retirement AA speech was a great moment in WCW as it was great tv and escalated the feud between horsemen and NWO.

  There are more great moments filled with NWO and Goldberg. They even have the notorious WCW Reboot where Russo and Eric were onto something with The New Blood vs Millionares Club. Hogan was recreated into a different character. He was more of an outlaw and that was great. The angle was great for awhile then just fizzled out.

  The matches are great. Some rare Nitro Title Matches with Booker T vs Russo and Jarrett. There is an awesome match from Great American Bash Kevin Nash vs Jeff Jarrett. Of course the epic Goldberg vs Hogan title match. Hogan vs The Giant at Havoc. The greatest match in WCW History of course The Outsiders and Hogan vs Luger, Macho and Sting at Beach 96.

  In the end Bret Hart summed it up best wrestling fans were looking for an alternative to WWF. They got it in WCW. WCW should be celebrated. It tried to compete and always deliver a great wrestling show for the fans. WCW there for awhile had an incredible roster and it seemed everything turned to gold. Even though it ended I am grateful for the time. Because it was just too sweet. One of my favorite memories was as a kid watching Hogan wrestle Luger on Nitro for the title and Luger beating up the entire NWO to put Hulk in the rack to win the belt. Cheers and Enjoy!",1405814400,2,2412,4.371364653243848

Overall: WWE continues to impress me with their WCW DVD releases. I've already got both volumes of Monday Nitro and the recent Greatest WCW PPV Matches. I plan on getting the Great American Bash set coming out next month and I plan on getting this set as well! This DVD is jam-packed with some of the best.....and worst WCW moments and matches that took place in the history it was alive. Not much is covered from 80s WCW as it's mostly 90s and 00s but if you're a real WCW fan, it won't matter. This content listing looks amazing and I can't wait to get my hands on it. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that we get a Thunder or Halloween Havoc set released down the line",1403049600,11,5939,4.440694310511089
