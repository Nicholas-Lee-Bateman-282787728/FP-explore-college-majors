7801211,5,1921643633,"Dr. Carter is far and away my favorite scientist/apologist for creation science.  This video is a good companion for his excellent ""Mitochondrial Eve and the three daughters of Noah""",1523491200,,182,5.275862068965517
7801212,5,1921643633,"Get ready on the pause button so that you can absorb all the information Dr. Carter provides from this rapidly advancing field. DNA is 4 dimensional, 3 dimensions plus it changes in time! Very well done and Dr. Carter gives all credit to our Designer Creator. After seeing this DVD I had to add it to my collection of information on the human body.",1519948800,,348,4.453125
7801213,5,1921643633,"This is one of the best videos that I've seen to show just how brilliant and complex and ordered and purposed and designed the human genome is, and it totally demolishes the idiocy of Darwinian evolution. Robert Carter is known for genetically producing fluorescent fish which certainly gives him credibility. He is an engaging speaker and his presentation is a true ""shock and awe"", especially when he describes the 4th dimension of the genome.",1400803200,5,445,5.027027027027027
