8105661,5,B000E43A8G,"This is one of my favourite films. Having watched the original series, I was delighted to find this on film. Telling the story of heroic Christabel Bielenberg, wife of one of those who tried to assassinate Hitler, this story is so fittingly acted and directed and together with having some hauntingly resonant music in parts, it creates a vivid atmosphere showing the rise of National Socialism and its consequences. It is a personal story though, and Liz Hurley acts so well in this that it has to be her best venture on screen. She looks different from the star we now recognise, but equally beautiful and her captivating screen presence makes this film outstanding. Part of the film is set in Germany and part in England, the antithesis between the two countries creating a tension throughout in terms of highlighting the life changes for Christabel as she experiences the effects of war with her family. The real life Christabel was undoubtedly totally unique- the bravery of going to Ravensbruck to try to get beloved Peter released was astonishing! This Dennis Potter production is really splendid, and quite a gem. I have watched it several times and never get bored of it. It is one of those films that poignantly tells so many stories in one, and it was made at a time in the 1980's when these sorts of series no doubt commanded larger budgets than they would today. This film really is a must for anyone interested in history! Liz Hurley is beautiful to watch!",1432339200,,1470,4.74609375

An Englishwoman who married a German prior to WW2 and her memories of raising a family in Nazi Germany.

8105665,3,B000E43A8G,"We purchased the ""manufactured on demand using DVD-R recordable media"" version of Christabel from Amazon.  We had seen the original broadcast on PBS and liked the production very much.  The story is based on actual events in the life of the title character.  The cast is first rate.

Our problem is with the picture quality.  Admittedly this was produced a long time ago, before High Definition, etc. However, this seems like a third generation copy taken off-the-air using a home VHS recorder.  It is the worst picture quality that I've seen on any DVD.  We have other DVDs from even earlier times that also have not been ""restored"" and they are all better than this.  The sound is acceptable, if not great.",1308700800,,708,4.745901639344262
8105666,5,B000E43A8G,"I had seen this movie on PBS many years ago.  I bought the book and read it. I was thrilled to see it available on DVD. It is an authentic look at Nazi Germany from a unique point of view.  That of a young English mother who had married a German.  The scene towards the end where she is in a railroad compartment with a foreign-born Gestapo Officer and he has a long speech telling her what he has done, is particularly moving.  There are some video problems, but it's worth it for the content.",1290211200,,494,4.168421052631579

SYNOPSIS:
CHRISTABEL (TV-UK-1988) - Elizabeth Hurley, Stephen Dillane
Uniformly excellent,  thought-provoking BBC-TV movie based on Christabel Burton Bielenberg's autobiography chronicles her marriage just prior to WWII to a German national and relocation to first Berlin and then a home in the Black Forest.

In a study of contrasts and just one stark scene of many, a friend of English-born Christabel (a niece of two Lords) and her husband Peter has been convicted in a failed 1944 assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler. As he hangs just two feet off the floor, conscious and slowly suffocating from a piano wire garrotte, there's a shift to a children's church choir singing ""Stille Nacht, heilige Nacht"" as Christabel looks on.

Several Allied carpet bomb raids are given a civilian view, as terrified Berliners huddle together -sometimes unprotected- while clusters of eight explosive devices fall. ""Christabel"" is one of the most effective films in portraying such horrors. Surviving losers in war must go on with their lives despite poverty, hunger, homelessness and widespead destruction. Here, we expereince that reality also.

This remarkable motion picture eschews politics to concentrate on the lives of PEOPLE, specifically non-combatants, often the most fragile and first to be lost during all-out war.",1255824000,7,1696,5.991735537190083
8105668,3,B000E43A8G,"While the edits in this DVD version of a 1989 miniseries aired on Masterpiece Theater in the US aren't blatant, to anyone familiar with the original version, they are striking by their absence. And the material that has been cut makes the plot much richer without detracting from the suspense of the plot.

The story hews closely to the biography of Christabel Bielenberg ( available as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/When-I-Was-a-German-1934-1945-An-Englishwoman-in-Nazi-Germany/dp/0803261519/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">When I Was a German, 1934-1945: An Englishwoman in Nazi Germany</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Past-is-Myself/dp/0701113332/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Past is Myself</a>, with a followup volume,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Road-Ahead/dp/0552994693/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Road Ahead</a>), an Englishwoman who marries a German lawyer and makes her home in Berlin in the early years of the Nazi regime. Her husband and their circle of friends deplore the Nazis (anti-Hitler conspirator Adam von Trott, later executed, is one of their circle) and the plot revolves around Christabel's growing recognition that it isn't possible to just live one's private life -- or leave -- when confronted with the kind of evil that the Nazis represent.

Even this edited version presents a kind of viewpoint that is rarely seen of 'ordinary' educated Germans facing the conundrum of how to react to evil and forces us to question how we would have fared in a similar situation. As Protestant pastor Martin Niemoller famously wrote, when the Nazis took away the communists, social democrats, trade unionists and Jews, people didn't speak up because they didn't fall into those categories. ""Then,"" Niemoller wrote, ""when they came for me, there was no one left to speak out."" This film looks at a group of people who did speak out.

Dennis Potter's imaginative touches (such as the scene where Christabel imagines, in a nightmare, parachutists invading her home and bayoneting her elderly father) make this a rewarding movie to watch, while the recurring echoes of the song to which Christabel listens dressing for her wedding in the opening scenes recurs throughout, sometimes offering an odd or jarring commentary on the scene.

All in all, this is an excellent film of a little-known story. But it deserves to be seen in full, so for anyone who hasn't yet discarded their VHS player, I'd urge you to get the complete version.",1234310400,13,2596,6.046195652173913
8105669,4,B000E43A8G,"I loved the book (called ""When I was a German"" in the United States) upon which this television movie was based.  The first half of the film barely follows the events of the book, but by the end manages to convey at least some of the book's highlights.  Elizabeth Hurley changed a lot physically after she appeared in ""Christabel"" - it's really hard to recognize her here.",1174780800,5,372,4.537313432835821
