It's a romance, first, a story of friendship second.  But it's also a meditation on choices of attitude.  I've seen this film numerous times and am waiting for a blu ray.",1491177600,,304,4.901960784313726
8544180,2,B009SZG6W4,"Look, Kitano is a talented filmmaker, no doubt about it. It's also true that no one, but no one, hits a home run each time at bat. This flick has moments; but it also drags in places and is rather uninteresting and dull. Also: there are times his actors simply appear weak, have zero presence. Is he aware of that?

I did love Sonatine, a gangster classic, as well as his take on Zatoichi. Both action marvels. Get them. You won't be disappointed.

RE: Hana-Bi: it has moments that will make you sit up and take notice; and then there will be times when you'll be tempted to hit the fast forward on your remote.",1402185600,,611,4.304347826086956
