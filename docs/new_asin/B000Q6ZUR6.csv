8194762,3,B000Q6ZUR6,I was very pleased with this item until I attempted to print out the recipes which was not made clear before I made this purchase.  Neither my computer nor others who tried to do this for me were successful.  The Corriher and Amazon websites haven't been helpful.  So.  Full marks fcr the work of Shirley Corriher but thumbs down on buying a product that requires your computer to have a special program to fully enjoy her product.  If someone will email me the bisquit recipe it will be greatly appreciated.  edde g,1292112000,3,516,4.554347826086956
8194763,3,B000Q6ZUR6,"I really enjoy Shirley Corriher's cookbooks as she does an outstanding job with getting at the root problem of why food fails.  And she is one of the few cookbook authors (not recipe book compilers - and there is a difference) who makes an engaging guest on cooking talk shows.

So I was really disappointed with this DVD because it contained so little.

The basics are there - how different foods react with different cooking times and other ingredients.  But the examples are so few and so limited!

I would recommend this DVD for people who want to introduce themselves (or a friend) to Corriher's terrific personality and cooking tips.  If you are a fan of Corrihers however, this DVD may disappoint.",1239580800,12,704,4.729508196721311
8194764,5,B000Q6ZUR6,"Shirley Corriher is a delightful writer who gives information in such a way that the reader is loathe to put the book down.  I found you could tell the color of a hen's egg by looking at the color of its ears.  Who knew?  The condition of the book is excellent, and delivery was rapid.",1203811200,7,285,4.1454545454545455
