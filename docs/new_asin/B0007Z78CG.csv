As if this were not enough, there are drops on the tape! The sound quality is mediocre, too. I've seen 'Brzezina' on TV and in a theatre before, so I know what it's supposed to look like - nothing like this nightmare. I regret having purchased anything from PolArt, and if their DVDs are the same quality, then I will have lost about $100 for no good reason...",1170028800,3,608,4.638888888888889
8054782,5,B0007Z78CG,"Birch wood is one of the most sensitive, intimate, poignant, haunting, tender and fascinating films in any age.

The story focuses around the relationship among two brothers: one of them is dying from tuberculosis and however, he is who still possesses this savoir vivre; the fine eye to appreciate the little details, a dawn or a walk in the forest, he plays the piano with febrile intensity with artistic mood and refined poetry, the tense relationship will engage the viewer from start to finish. Beautifully photographed, with admirable game lights, and the arresting images from Poland' s woods.

Wajda made one of his superlative works of his brilliant career.",1121558400,4,666,5.10091743119266
