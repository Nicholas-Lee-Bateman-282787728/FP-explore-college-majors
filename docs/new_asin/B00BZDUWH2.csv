8575817,5,B00BZDUWH2,"I bought it just for ""Attack Of The Tromaggot"" - great Troma-Fan-Flick from Germany - I like the dead body scene at the beginning - reminds me of Todesking by Buttgereit",1458259200,,169,4.483870967741935
8575818,5,B00BZDUWH2,I bought this because of Teenape Vs. The monster nazi apocalypse. I am a BIG Chris Seaver fan and not only was I crazy happy to hear he had a TROMA release but the fact that the band I play bass in PAKO was one of the bands used for background music. This flick is supper funny and dirty I would recommend it as well as his other work if you are a fan of low budget TROMA style movies.,1378166400,,385,3.825
8575819,5,B00BZDUWH2,"Mutantz, Nazis and Zombies, a collection of three films released through Troma Entertainment, is a delightful package of off-beat independent comedy films with a bent towards the horror genre. Consisting of ""The Secret of the Magic Mushrooms"" (dir. Christian Markhoff and Werner Timm,) ""Attack of the Tromaggot"" (dir. Leslie Teah,) and ""Teen Ape vs. The Monster Nazi Apocalypse"" (dir. Chris Seaver,) Mutantz, Nazis and Zombies is a hefty two-hundred and fifty minutes of daring, entertaining content. Just on the sheer length of the package you're guaranteed to find something you like in it, and more than that it's a valuable look at the true face of independent film today. While it's true that these films may not be everyone's idea of entertainment, if you're the type of person that enjoys the more shocking and controversial side of independent comedy, this is the release for you.

These three films, all of which are similarly campy in a self-aware manner, are all included together on this release because they are all of a certain creative mindset. These films all take a refreshingly transgressive approach to filmmaking: they are uncompromisingly bold in their imagery and content, witty in their senses of humor, and challenging in their choices of subject matter. Between a story about a young man who (drunkenly) tries to bring his friend back from the dead through the use of ""magic mushrooms,"" a story about a giant mutated maggot who crawls out of toxic sewage to terrorize the city of Maggotown, and a story about a group of Paranormal Investigators (one of whom is an anthropomorphic Teen Ape) trying to stop an underground Nazi plot to bring about the Fourth Reich (through the use of monsters,) there's nothing conventional about the films in this collection, and of course that's part of their appeal. They're also arguably subtly-intelligent cautionary tales--regarding drugs, environmental pollution, and totalitarianism respectively--which refuse to take the easy way out in getting their points across. On the very surface, though, these are three entertaining films which come with their own unique sensibilities and very funny, often rude, humor.

Included in the release are several special features which make it an even more worthwhile disc to get your hands on, such as trailers for all three of the main features, a handful of trailers for other Troma releases, and two short films from the Troma catalog. The features themselves are of varying audio-visual quality, but none of them are in any way hard to watch or listen to. The packaging is simple and appealing, and the cover art makes it a great shelf piece for collectors, such as myself. The menu designs are clean and easy to navigate, in a manner that is typical of Troma's DVD releases.

In conclusion, Mutantz, Nazis and Zombies may not please everyone, but for fans of goofy, off-beat camp comedy with a daring, independent outlook, there are many things to be enjoyed on this disc.",1372291200,2,2979,5.063136456211812
