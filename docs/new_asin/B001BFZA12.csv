8398952,5,B001BFZA12,"This film  is based on a true story about a young man with very conservative middle class parents in urban Brazil, who catch him with a single joint, and decide to put him in a psychiatric hospital.  Anyone interested in psychiatric treatment or cross-cultural mental health care should see this film as it traces the protagonist's downward spiral from a normal, if defiant, adolescent to a shell, a human wreck, because of psychiatric treatments including electroshock and pharmaceuticals.  I wish the film could be made more easily available in the United States as it should be in every university library.",1276992000,3,609,5.07
