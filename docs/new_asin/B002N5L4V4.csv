The tin did not survive shipping and the discs were loose and scratched up. I might try to polish the scratches out. They play ""ok"" with some glitches. Overall a disappointing presentation of some good kung fu movies.",1527033600,,321,4.551724137931035

8374629,5,B002N5L4V4,"Am catching up to some movies I missed from back in the day. Watched ""Heroes shed No Tears"" and ""The Heroic Ones"" and found both entertaining and know I will watch on more Saturday mornings with tea and then cereal and milk. But I'm looking forward to ""The Delightful Forest"" because I've read so much about WuSong lately, so I'm ready to see the story. But does anyone know about getting the book ""Outlaws of the Marsh"" in English?",1410307200,,432,4.481012658227848

8374631,4,B002N5L4V4,"This set does a good job of covering some various aspects of the Shaw's output. Kind of wierd that 2 of these movies were in Well Go's other Shaw Boxset but its obvious this company is just slapping these things together, check out the cover art on Two Chapmions of Shaolin for example.

Heroic Ones (1970) a big budget epic by Chang Cheh starring David Chiang, Ti Lung. Doesn't have the intricate martial arts of later kung fu movies but is great if you can appreciate the older Shaw classics.

The Delightful Forest (1972) Another Chang Cheh, this one showcases Ti Lung, a little more open handed kung fu, still not the Venoms or Lau Kar Leung level of coreography but its a step away from the big budget sword epics. One of the bloodiest endings in a kung fu movie I can remember.

Two Champions of Shaolin (1980) Chang Cheh and the Venoms team. This is a stark contrast to the old school epics, filmed on the shaw studio sets with a smaller cast, the focus is now on the action and skills of the preformers. Lots of fun, espcially if you like cheesey dubbing.

Heroes Shed No Tears (1980) isn't anamorphic, I watched it once and I probably won't ever watch it again. I guess its ok if you're into WuXia coustume fantasies, or a big Fu Sheng fan, but I found it hard to follow and not enough action to revisit it.",1264118400,5,1316,4.359183673469388
8374632,1,B002N5L4V4,"Heroes Shed No Tears is not 16x9(anamorphic widescreen)

Well Go fails again. Their ""Journey of the Doomed"" dvd is not 16x9 either. However the Region 3 imports of these films ARE 16x9. I fail to see how Well Go could screw up in the same way again.

""The Delightful Forest"" is a great, fun film and is 16x9. Both of these films seem to have the original dubs included, but I'm no expert in that matter.",1261094400,,403,4.2894736842105265
8374633,5,B002N5L4V4,"The Epic Heroes Shaw Brothers collection from Well Go USA is a set of four classic Shaw Brothers martial arts movies, nicely packaged in a collectible tin case.  The Hong Kong based Shaw Brothers studio was the biggest Chinese language movie studio of its time, and made literally hundreds of martial arts movies (as well as other genres) during its heyday from the mid 1960s through its closure in the mid 1980s.  The movies were internationally popular for their depictions of Chinese history, legends and literature, their wonderful sets, costumes and production values, their stable of charismatic stars, and their pioneering directors, martial arts choreographers and stuntmen.

 Of the movies included, ""The Heroic Ones"" is perhaps the most notable.  Made in 1970, it was one of the most expensive Chinese movies ever made at the time, and it deals with the exploits of a heroic family fighting bandits during the Tang dynasty.  With a huge cast of extras, lots of large, outdoor battle scenes, and non-stop action, it's a film that's very impressive in its scope.  Directed by Chang Cheh (who became famous for  his ""heroic bloodshed"" movies featuring noble heroes who always go down fighting), The Heroic Ones features David Chiang and Ti Lung.  These two charismatic stars were the main draws for Shaw Brothers at this time, and they give great performances in this tale of intrigue, betrayal and conflict.

 ""The Delightful Forest"" from 1972 is the film version of one of the stories from the famous Chinese historical novel ""Outlaws of the Marsh"", and features Ti Lung as the hero Wu Song.  Great production values and sharp martial arts scenes highlight this entertaining film.

 ""Two Champions of Shaolin"" is from 1980, and features ""the venoms"", a troupe of actors/martial artists/acrobats that starred together in a number of Shaw films, most famously in ""The Five Venoms"" from 1977.  This film is also directed by Chang Cheh, and compared to his films from the early 70s, his early 80s films usually had lower budgets and production values, and instead amped up the martial arts scenes, both in speed and complexity.  ""Two Champions"" is a story of conflict between Shaolin and Wutang students, and concerns the latter's collaboration with the Qing rulers over Han China.  There is action throughout, and the film ends with a typically exciting and acrobatic fight scene from the venoms actors.

 ""Heroes Shed No Tears"" is also from 1980, and is a film version of one of the wuxia (heroic swordsman) novels of popular Chinese author Gu Long.  It can be a bit confusing, with many clan characters, betrayals and shifting loyalties, but the action scenes deliver.  This movie also stars popular Shaw actor Alexander Fu Sheng, who was tragically killed in a car accident in 1983.  His upbeat, likeable, mischievous personality made him a fan favorite during his years with the Shaw studio.

 Although these four movies don't quite represent the cream of the crop of Shaw Brothers studios, they're each solid, and are a good representation of the variety of martial arts movies that the studio produced.  From accounts of actual historical events, to the retelling of both old and new stories from Chinese literature, these films provide an interesting, entertaining window on Chinese culture and filmmaking.

 Well Go USA should be complimented for presenting each of these films in anamorphic widescreen, preserving the original aspect ratio of the films.  The picture quality of these restored films is very nice, and the audio options include the original language track and an optional English dub.  All in all, a very nice set.",1260748800,8,3644,5.056951423785595
