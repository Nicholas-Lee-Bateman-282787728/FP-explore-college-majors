There is a strange soundtrack, however, where someone is reading the intertitles aloud.  I just turned this down on put on some Zhou Xuan music.  There are no subtitles on this DVD.  However, you can get a translation here: [...]

8162595,3,B000LP50EA,"Many viewers of ""The Goddess"" (1934), with its superlative performance by Ruan Ling-yu, will want to see ""New Woman"" (1935; the title also translates in the plural), in which this actress reveals every dimension of her mature art.  While an archival and subtitled print of ""New Woman"" has been screened in academe, it does not appear to be available commercially.  Instead we are favored by Guangzhou Beauty with this bizarre DVD, transferred from a video of an early sound release of a silent movie.  The deteriorated soundtrack preserves the worst dubbing in history, and once your ""mute"" button is pressed, you confront Ruan Ling-yu and her fellow players through an intermittent torrent of scratches and blotches.  It's like visiting the ruins of some monument that COULD be salvaged.  No subtitles are provided ... for a silent film abounding in calligraphic title cards, supplemented with lingering shots of letters, bills, and Shanghai newspapers.

So your choice is to either (1) postpone your experience of this important film until an acceptable print is available; (2) tolerate this dud as an introduction to the achievement of Ruan Ling-yu and her colleagues.  The second choice is possible, since behind all those scratches there is, in most frames, a clear registration of the image.  If you purchase this edition, here's my advice: 1. Ensure you've viewed ""The Goddess"" first, in the archival DVD accompanying a biography of Ling-yu by Richard Meyer; 2. Access the M[odern] C[hinese] L[iterature and] C[ulture] website, where Eileen Chow has translated the film script of ""New Woman""; 3. Consult Dr. Chow's translation, if required, as you progress through the movie, concentrating on what the actors are supposedly saying - and writing; 4. Commit yourself to subsequent viewings, focused on the visual dimensions of this work.

Does a portrayal of Shanghai's ""Modern Woman"" in 1935 merit all that trouble?  Emphatically, yes.  The film has obvious social implications, some of them disturbingly pertinent to men as well as women in the U.S.A. seven decades later.  At the movie's debut, it may have been a gung-ho woman of the people, with her martial songs of liberation, who fit the title best.  That character is portrayed with engaging vigor, but it's Wei Ming, the young lady played by Ruan Ling-yu, who resonates most emphatically today.  A music teacher who has authored a novel (ominously titled ""The Tomb of Love""), Wei Ming boasts many advantages denied the streetwalker of ""The Goddess.""  She comes from a prosperous (if largely alienated) family, she is educated, and she finds incentives to pursue a creative life.  What she lacks, at the movie's commencement, is the unflinching integrity of the protagonist of ""The Goddess,"" which allows this heroic woman to endure a maelstrom of degradation and heartbreak.  For all her artistic commitment, Wei Ming seems deficient in that inner knowledge which permits an author to give her characters dramatic life, even as she discovers those characters within herself.  Admirably untrammeled by social prejudice (she cheerfully inhabits a group of flats that includes a brothel), Wei Ming is something of a narcissist, adorning her room with a seductive photograph of herself and participating in the merchandizing of her writing with such portraits.  Initiated into the perils of romance by a broken marriage before she reached Shanghai, she offends her most constant male friend by flirting with him outrageously, in a funny sequence that may travesty Ling-yu's indiscretions (for a recreation, check out the DVD of a 2003 Cantonese play about Ruan, starring Chiu Woon).  In the opening scene, Wei Ming has bought a ""new-woman""-style toy for her daughter, whom she entrusted a few years before to her elder sister (played impressively by Tianxiu Tang).  Yet that daughter is ignorant of her mother, and Wei Ming has been too preoccupied with her fiction to write very often to her sister, even after that sister lost her husband.  Wei Ming has concealed her daughter's existence from her closest friends in Shanghai, and after her sister and the girl have joined her, she lodges them in a hotel to continue this deception.  All very ""new"" and enterprising: but compare the heartrending sacrifice of the young mother at the conclusion of ""The Goddess.""

Our ""new woman"" is gifted, attractive -- even lovable; but she has things to learn.  Within a few days, she learns too much - about herself and the pillars of her society - and with a rapidity that destroys her.  Beginning as comic, Wei Ming by movie's end has been wounded into tragedy, expending the last pulsations of her heart on a fruitless appeal to live.  Such a transition would be impossible, without the variety of dramatic realization commanded by Ruan Ling-yu.  For a stage actress to change her identity before our eyes, as if some inner force was refashioning her countenance and her frame, is rare enough.  You may in your lifetime be privileged to witness this effect - for me, it was in South India - and when it occurs, you believe in the genius attributed to the French actress Rachel, or to her successor, Eleonora Duse.  In this unlikely vehicle from Shanghai, in the poorest source print imaginable, amid pasteboard sets standing open to a shifting sky, one may, with patience, behold in Ruan Ling-yu precisely such moments of transformation.  How would her performance register in an archival edition?",1214092800,8,5450,5.09673790776153
