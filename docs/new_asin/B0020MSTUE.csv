Simply ridiculous stage settings. Whatever do they think..... that we will understand and appreciate Mozart more? Turn the TV or projector off and listen to the music.,1405036800,,331,5.384615384615385
8348546,5,B0020MSTUE,"I have over 150 opera and ballet DVD/BRs that I watch on a projected screen about 7' 8"" wide and listen through a 7.1 loudspeaker setup where the front speakers are about 9' 6"" apart. The room has sound treatments so I hear what's on the disc, not distorting reflections from the walls. The goal is to make the viewing experience as if I was there in a middle seat in one of the front rows.

Picture is fine, as with most BRs.

Audio is DTS-HD MA 7.1 (or PCM stereo, which I didn't listen to) and it is a showcase for surround sound. Sound stage for the orchestra is 160 degrees and you have the impression of sitting in the center of the front row. The cembalo, for instance, is just a tad forward from the right surround. All instrument groups nicely spread out in front of you. You can't record that any better.
The voices are through the center and are clear thanks to well hidden body mics. For perfection, they would have moved with the singers across the stage. I could not find much fault with the 7 principals' voices, although you might like some more than others. Balance with the orchestra is most of the time also good. Sometimes I wished the voices were a bit louder, but the way they are recorded is very realistic and resembles ""being there"".
Applause is from the front and surrounds. Again, for perfection, it should have come from the surround and back as to confirm the impression of sitting in row 1.

Overall, you get over 3 hours of Mozart music, well conducted, played, sung and recorded: 5 stars.

As for the modern theatrical direction and stage setting, I have mixed feelings. Having the principals tiptoe through dry branches and sticks on the ground or seeing what must have been painful impressions on the knees from kneeling on that ground didn't add any comedy for me. But filling 3 hours in a garden or forest with action is a tall order and most of the time it was acted quite well, although sometimes a bit too goofy for me.
If you enjoy Mozart's music and excellent surround sound, this is for you. Just close your eyes when the stage action is too distracting.
There is a 3 minute trailer from TDK/Naxos on youtube.",1345939200,9,2151,4.451776649746193
8348547,5,B0020MSTUE,"While this opera is not in the same class as the later Mozart masterpieces, it is nevertheless very enjoyable. Apart from the less forceful voice of Liliana Nikiteanu in Act 1 (she warmed up later), the singing is very good, accompanied by the Zurich Opera Orchestra playing historical instruments and conducted by Harnoncourt.

In common with many operas the storyline is not very deep or involved but is performed here with gusto and affection. The costuming is attractively modern and the set very plain but this does not detract from appreciating the performance. The most amazing attribute to the work is that Mozart was only 18 when it was composed. Yet it is more sophisticated to me than many other operas and deserves better recognition that it is usually accorded.

The audio (DTS Master Audio 7.1) and video are first class. Recommended.",1269907200,8,848,4.964788732394366
