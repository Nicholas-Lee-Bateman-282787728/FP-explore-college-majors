8521366,4,B007RKFY8E,"Good movie.  The main character was likable, and I always like movies about truck drivers and the mob.

Picture and sound were good, but did notice a few imperfections sitting up close.  Justing letting readers know because some of these warner archive movies look perfect.  Still this one looked good just not perfect.

Recommended.
