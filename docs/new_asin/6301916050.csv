380396,3,6301916050,"Everything you have read is true. This movie is simply awful as far as plot, acting, and effects are concerned. Yet somehow, it manages to be enjoyable all the same. Yes, it features Traci Lords, which is perhaps its main claim to fame (or infamy). Her acting is, shall we say, unremarkable. You know you are watching high quality when you would actually rather not see the women who do the nude scenes get nude.  I also bet you did not know that Stephen Quadros (Angel Martin) is a highly respected martial arts expert who has helped choreograph scenes for actors like Jet Li.

Basically the appeal of this movies is how well it encapsulates all the sterotypes of 80's fashion and hair metal. This is not Spinal Tap by any means, but most of its charm is because it was viewed by guys in their early and late teens who enjoyed the Metal God Cinderella tale (with Faustian overtones), while yearning for a glimpse of Traci Lords in all her glory (all were disappointed in this wish). The main fans of this movie are now approaching or in their 30's but the nostalgia remains. The fact that it often aired on Cinemax or HBO just prior to Headbangers Ball should give an indication as to some of the audience. I was one of them.",1145577600,10,1226,4.444444444444445

380398,5,6301916050,"Since the first time I saw this, I have been an avid fan of this over looked, would-be ""Cult Classic"".  The story line is typical.  A down trodden and geeky youth, sells his soul to the local voodoo priestess, and in turn gains incredible Electric Guitar skills, A fancy house with three other equally cursed women, who also sold their souls for various reasons, and a position in a rising Metal Band, ""Spastic Colon"".  The name of the Band alone is awesome! The catch is, he must feed on the living to keep his powers and immortality.  There is a minor dramatic love-conflict, in that he desires ""the other Girl"", in this case played by Traci Lords.  It is a fun movie to watch with a beer in your hand, and to just get your mind off of things.
 This movie is hilarious if you approach it with the attitude you do all ""B"" Horror films.",1086652800,21,836,4.326923076923077

380527,4,6301916050,"Shock 'Em Dead is a somewhat easy target when it comes to bashing or just not understanding it for what it is
But, there's a reason it's become a massive cult film

I seen it 20 years ago on VHS at the time it didn't blow me away
In fact i didn't really like it much
But, after watching the film recently i can appreciate the film for what it is
It's very unique and different for a late 1980's horror film
It's also underground/indie  it looks like a  Troma film mixed with a mid 1980's adult film
It reminds me of a live action version of Digital Pictures's  Night Trap

The Cast all play is straight and close to the vest (That helps a great deal) The performances are all very good for this type of flick

Stephen Quadros  (Angel Martin) is awesome once he gets the long black hair and rock star look he owns it
Christopher Maleki  (Dustin) the drummer
Laurel Wiley  (Monique)
Tyger Sodipe  (Voodoo Woman)
Troy Donahue  (Record Exec)
Aldo Ray  (Tony)
Tim Moffett  (Greg)
Markus Grupa  (Johnny)
Karen Russell  (Michelle)
Gina Parks  (Marilyn)
David Homb  (Izzy)
Traci Lords  (Lindsay Roberts) Lords was the major draw for this film it's without a doubt the weakest performance  which isn't her fault the character was written paper thin Not the worst or best thing Traci Lords did (The worst would be Zack and Miri Make a Porno)

The story is basically  faust  told in the 1980's metal era
All the f/x are practical the only thing that looks cheap is the eyes glowing
the score/soundtrack through out the film is really good for a indie film it has a great score behind it

The blu ray25th Anniversary edition
Is it worth getting if you have the original out of print dvd?
That all depends this is not by any means a true HD print
but, there's a warning on the back of the case that it's Not sourced from an HD Master: remastered from 1"" Tape and upconverted to bluray and dvd specifications
This version is also Region Free (A,B, and  C)
If you always wanted to own this on home video this is the best way to go since the previous vhs and dvd are out of print and super rare and expensive  This is worth it for a physical version
The PQ isn't bad at all imo (some people on blu-ray.com act as though it's as bad as a rough work print) It's very good
My biggest gripe with the PQ is the ratio of the picture it's 4:3 i hate anything 4:3 with all HD+ tv being in Widescreen 4:3 looks terrible
The 2.0 DTS-HD audio is actually very good for a small budget film almost everything sounds spot on
Another massive draw for any horror fans/collectors is the massive laundry list of special features
Extras include:
***** Commentary by director Mark Freed,
Short Interview with Director less then 5 minutes (One major negative with these extras they were cut strange instead of someone asking the questions you get a edit a black title card with the question then it goes to the Director responding to the question this is silly a film student could get away with this not a film house disturber
 Cast Reunion 2015  actors Stephen Quadros, Laurel Wiley, Mark Richardson, Tyler Bowe, and Christopher Maleki, co-writer Dave Tedder, guitarist Dave Celentano, and superfan Zak Beseda  (This is very cool but, that bloody editing/cuts are used here too! none the less this is a very cool exclusive all the cast members look great  I'm sure this was done during a horror convention after watching this I'd love to meet these people they all come off very cool and down to earth and are actually proud of this little B Flick
****""Director's Cut""
****Deleted & Extended Scenes ,
*****Actor Auditions ,
**Photo Gallery,
*****  ""Cast Revisits Audition Tapes""  (very unique and cool) enjoyable!
***** Cast Views Deleted & Extended Scenes  (once again unique and very cool)
***Poster & Art Gallery and a  Trailer

When you get down to it this film is a fun, fast enjoyable throw-back
They don't make films like this anymore that's for sure like i said before this film is a easy target at all the hipster ""Trolls"" who are either to young to understand it or just to dense and out of touch
During the cast reunion there was talk of a Shock 'Em Dead II  (which might be cool if done correctly it's hard to catch lightning in a bottle for a second time
Of all the unnecessary remakes over the last 10+ years remaking Shock 'Em Dead could work if done with love and respect
This is a real buried treasure that should be discovered and given a chance
If you go into it with a opened mind it will surprise the hell out of any and all children of the 1980's

380528,5,6301916050,"In a way a movie like this should of been lost in the land of home video when it came out in the early 90s. But there's definitely a cult following for it. Does this deserve a Bluray release probably not, but hey you can pick up the DVD up if you want it. Lots of great extra features on it. Great price for it $14.99 at time of posting.

380531,4,6301916050,"Shock em' Dead is a shot on video product of the straight to video market, and with that in mind the movie is superbly fun. While never truly awful, being well aware of the kind of silly movie they were making , no single part of Shock em dead is truly standout. It isn't scary, the acting isn't great, and the kills are ultimately uncreative, but it is super fun and surprisingly funny. Definitely a must see for anyone who likes heavy metal horror.
The transfer isn't great but olive did a pretty good job with what they had. Don't except a wide screen crystal clear blu, since they didn't have the elements to make it happen. There are some pretty nice extras which is a nice change of pass for Olive and Slasher video considering a lot of there releases are pretty barebones.",1451088000,6,779,4.416666666666667

380603,3,6301916050,"This is a rather decent horror movie and if you liked Metal during the eighties is is enjoyable. There are a couple of interesting historical moments ,a couple of the older actors playing the record company agents are well known actors .An interesting screen involves them playing a rap song for the band and telling them ""it is the new thing. Since the movie came out in 1990 ,that is the death of hair metal and the beginning of rap. Traci Lords is in the movie and is a big marketing point but not that big a part in the movie. She had done her first non porn movie (Not of This Earth) and appeared naked in that one,But by the time this was made ,she wanted to be a serious actress so no nudity. The rest of the video vixen types all appear topless. The story is a Robert Johnson cliche ,selling your soul to the devil for fame and talent. In order to stay in this World ,the lead must kill and take people's energy. Low slasher horror wth little blood and gore for the time. The songs are actually quite well done and catchy,they are over the top along with the lead singer of the band. This makes the film a mix of satire ,comedy and horror but people younger than 40 won't get all the jokes. Now for the bad part ,this Blu Ray actually makes the movie a bit worse. How can it make it worse?Well all the scenes using two cameras go from one camera that is very clear to another camera that looks blurred,it actually is so noticeable ,that I started to say Camera 1 ,Camera 2 when it happened. The movie was shot on 35mm ,one handheld camera operator or the camera itself was bad. The film was direct to video tape so no one ever noticed the big difference but because of the transfer you can really tell. Nice list of extras but neither Traci Lords or Micheal Angelo Batio are involved on any of the extras,those are the two most interesting of the living cast members. Also I would have enjoyed the entire songs played to the slide shows instead of just pieces and the so called ""Directors Cut"" is just about two minutes of al the topless girl shots. I find it interesting that Slasher Films dumped both this and Killer Workout the same week,they problably didn't make a lot of these because honestly neither needed to be a Blu Ray ,DVD standard would have been fine.",1448236800,5,2274,4.315420560747664
380604,5,6301916050,"As good as the film will ever look- this Slasher // Video Blu-ray / DVD release of Shock 'Em Dead was mastered from the best available source (a 1"" Sony Reel Tape Master). The film was originally shot on 35MM in 1990, but it was transferred to tape & mastered from that point on, so there is not an actual 35MM print of this film (in completion) in existence. The transfer was done in Los Angeles in February 2015 & has been cleaned up as best as possible with this type of element (master). This blu-ray/dvd release will have many extras, including an audio commentary, great rock/metal music (remastered & edited with all audio tracks available), photo galleries, & a cast reunion with the likeable characters from the film (including the great Stephen Quadros). Thank you, & enjoy this new release on its 25th Anniversary.

380606,5,6301916050,"Shock Em Dead is a super blast from the past. The movie is a true cult classic and if you haven't seen it you're not a real movie fan (fanatic).

We have a mom n pop video shop in Las Vegas/Henderson called Movies & Candy and the director/writer Mark Freed came into our store tonight. He shocked me almost dead. He has been coming in since we opened in October of 2012 and is one of the nicest most humble genuine guys you'll ever meet. Myself and my fellow movie geeks have been trying to track this film down since we opened. Anyways after talking to Mark about music and films he mentioned that Shock Em Dead was his movie (I'm paraphrasing a long incredible conversation) and I almost flatlined (deadsville)! I can't wait to tell everyone who cares!!!! Good luck Mark! What a memorable evening.

He actually went home and brought me back a few copies of this underground hard to get movie. I'm blown away and closed a bit early. Now I'm sitting here watching it in our private theater @ the store and just buggin out, thinking about what happened.

Alright Im signing off and enjoying Traci Lords and tipping my hat to the movie Gods. Shocked me dead and now I can die and go to heaven a happy happy man.",1413504000,,1209,4.364444444444445

380608,5,6301916050,"This movie is such a rare gem especially if you're into the humor of hair metal bands and shred guitar! Shock 'em dead brilliantly mixes comedy, and horror together to achieve one of the most hilarious rock n roll adventures of all time! Stephen Quadros kills as the dorky rocker who sells his soul to the devil to become the greatest rockstar in the world. Traci Lords also is a great actress in this as well as some nice eye candy. I especially enjoyed the directors cut on this disc. Haha! You'll see! And the directors commentary is awesome. No regrets on this purchase!

It aims to be a raunchy comedy and it delivers. Its corny and gory, with T&A around ever corner and I cannot get enough. That's the way I love my movies. If you are curious even a little and love troma or tromaesque movies you will not be disappointed with this movie. I'd say if you see a copy for sale buy it, because it won't be on here for long, people know a good thing and they will buy it before you, I did.",1309564800,,557,3.982142857142857

her true age! but enough is enough! all is forgiven for traci lords,after all, it is the 2000's. so do your traci lords/horror movie loving heart a favor and get this film, you WILL NOT REGRET IT!! i got mine! now get yours! right here at amazon.com.

The DVD is a full screen VHS transfer (it ain't blu-ray kids) but even on big screen TV it doesn't look too bad.

7817075,5,6301916050,"This is quite possibly my favorite heavy metal horror film of all time! I'm a big fan of Trick Or Treat, Rocktober Blood and Black Roses but I find this one the most entertaining. With low budget films a lot relies on the chemistry between the cast and crew and it flows quite nicely here. It was made at the tail end of the metal scene in California just before 90's alternative music took over so there were many resources available that capture the real feel of the seasoned era before it's demise.
Traci Lords plays a very straight manager for Spastic Colon, a band that truly is awful until Angel Martin (Stephen Quadros of Auntie Lee's Meat Pies fame) shows up with his new found talent courtesy of a deal with the devil. Though the deal set Angel up with three lovely ladies, a mansion and the guitar skills of Michael Angelo (literally!), he still is not content. Turns out, Traci Lords is so amazingly hot that he'll sacrifice his life dream, his soul and yes...even his wig for the girl of his dreams. But not before he murders for lifeforce, rocks out a four neck BC Rich and vomits on groupies!
The film serves as more of a comedy than a horror but the ""what if?"" premise knocks down most walls and lets you just roll with the punches. Aldo Ray wraps up his extensive acting career with this gem as Angel's previous boss Tony. TV star Christopher Maleki plays Spastic Colon's drummer and ends up being one of the most likable characters in the film. Tim Moffett does okay as a jealous boyfriend/bass player but doesn't seem fit for the hero role. Karen Russell, Laurel Wiley and Gina Parks keep things fun as Angel's entourage and lend quite a bit of nudity to the picture.
I rented this movie when I was 12 (shortly after it was released) and immediately fell in love. Thus, it has become part of my regular watching for the past 25 years. Newcomers will find the dated clothing styles and music hilarious but most likely be highly entertained. It's miles away from modern metal horror like Deathgasm but if you have a soft spot for 80's hair metal and enjoy low budget movies you will not be disappointed.",1481068800,2,2119,4.492227979274611
