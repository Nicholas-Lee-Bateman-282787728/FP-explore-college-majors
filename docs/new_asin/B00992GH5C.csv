5279673,5,B00992GH5C,I love when they take 3 part or 4 part story arcs and edit them together to make a movie. this was just as good as the animated clone wars movie released 4 or 5 years ago. i won't give it away but this is ideal for people like me who only collect movie versions of series and not the whole series.,1352332800,6,297,3.806451612903226

5279675,5,B00992GH5C,"Darth Maul Returns to the Star Wars Universe in this movie version of 4 Season 4 Clone Wars episodes.  The movie is (IMHO) very weel put together and paced.  I actually missed the episode where Ventress became a Bounty Hunter so it was nice to see that tale.  There is alot going on in this story and some very cool questions come to mind (but I'll let you see that unfold yourselves).

I do hope that Lucasfilms will release a movie version ( as there was a limited theatrical release of these episodes) of the fallout between Ventress & Dooku leading to Savage's Introduction.  I feel that would have been a great lead up to this DVD movie.

My biggest recommendation though, get this at Target.  They are selling it for 9.00, but get it!!!",1349136000,11,742,4.451851851851852
5279676,4,B00992GH5C,"The last four episodes of The Clone Wars Season 4 were definitely a highlight for the series. With the return of Darth Maul, there was a lot of tension. This set presents all four as an 88-minute movie and overall I really enjoyed seeing the episodes in this format. While I found most of the editing choices to be wonderful, a few cuts felt like they undermined the tension.

First, the episodes don't play in the same order they aired. In fact, this is very much an edited directors cut with portions of some episodes played out of order. For example, the entire movie starts with the scene from ""Brothers"" in which Savage Opress leaves Coruscant as he takes off to find Maul. Then we get the Nightsister episode Massacre, almost exactly as it originally aired. Then we get the rest of ""Brothers"" - well, almost. Then comes ""Bounty"", again almost exactly as aired. Finally, the movie ends with ""Revenge"".

On the one hand, I like the editing in that it frames the entire four episodes around the search for Maul. The structure really highlights the parallel story of Savage Opress and Asajj Ventress' journeys - one to find his brother, the other to find herself. As originally aired, ""Bounty"" seemed like the odd episode out.

However, a few scenes did get cut, particularly from ""Brothers"", that I thought actually lessened the impact of Maul's return. In particular, the scene at the end where Yoda warns Obi-Wan about Maul's return didn't make it into this cut. On the one hand, it was always a bit odd that Yoda could detect Maul's presence from so far away, but Palpatine thrived right under his little green nose. On the other hand, it was a nice scene to show how Obi-Wan learns about Maul's return. The current cut doesn't provide anything quite so neat a segueway.

Overall, this is a fun way to experience - or watch - these four episodes. There isn't any new material so much as I could tell, but the editing is different enough to make worth watching at least once if you're a fan of the show. This DVD is a great option for fans who don't plan on getting the Season 4 DVD set when it comes out (I prefer to wait until the entire series is over before I buy the DVDs). However, if you do plan to buy the Season 4 DVD set, there might not be enough new material to make this release worth owning.",1347667200,41,2310,4.479809976247031

5279699,4,B00992GH5C,"I'm a little bit on the fence about this one. Might very well consider getting it at Target. In the meantime, I'd like to provide a much more appropriate synopsis:

Best known for his role in the STAR WARS multimedia tale ""The Force Unleashed"" as the voice & face of Darth Vader's secret Sith apprentice Galen ""Starkiller"" Marek, redeemed Jedi & founding father of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, Sam Witmer lends his vocal talents to the not-quite-dead Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Maul in this special feature-length compilation movie, edited together from the last four episodes of STAR WARS: The Clone Wars, Season 4.

When the Nightsisters are nearly wiped out on Dathomir by General Grievous (Matthew Wood) & his droid army as payback for an attempt on the life of Count Dooku (Corey Burton), Asajj Ventress (Nika Futterman) must carve out a new niche in the galaxy, eventually joining a team of bounty hunters led by a young but determined Boba Fett (Daniel Logan). Meanwhile, after narrowly eluding capture by Anakin Skywalker (Matt Lanter) and his student Ahsoka Tano (Ashley Eckstein), the dark warrior Savage Oppress (Clancy Brown) follows a trail across the stars to the junkyard world of Lotho Minor and finally locates his missing brother, the Sith apprentice Darth Maul (Sam Witmer), who - by a miracle of the Force - narrowly survived his lightsaber duel with Obi-Wan Kenobi (James Arnold Taylor) on Naboo 10 years before the Clone Wars began. With his mind and body restored by Mother Talzin (Barbara Goodson), Maul has every intention of getting revenge on his longtime Jedi nemesis for being robbed of his destiny and his legs - with Savage's assistance. However, Obi-Wan will have some unexpected help of his own in this ultimate rematch against one of the deadliest assassins ever crafted by the dark side of the Force.

Update: chalking this one up as another well-thought-out B&N purchase. I'll admit, some of you guys were right: the editing choices left much to be desired, but it was worth it.",1394323200,,2024,4.895043731778426
