8228824,5,6303444350,"'Baywatch the Movie: Forbidden Paradise' was a good movie for a straight to video, and it also aired on TV during Season 6 as a 2-Parter.",1235952000,,137,4.3076923076923075
8228825,5,6303444350,"Get ready for the cinematic experience of a lifetime... ""Baywatch: Forbidden Paradise"" is the Citizen Kane of the nineties. Impeccable performances, brilliant directing and breathtaking locations perfectly photographed. When I saw this picture (or two hour long episode special, whatever) I decided to drop film school for good, there's no way I can beat that. Now I'm making on air promotions for a Latin American cable channel.

Director Douglas Schwartz and actor/singer/hand model David Hasselhoff reminded me of cinemas greatest duets: Fellini and Mastroianni, Bergman and Von Sydow, Scorsese and DeNiro,

Josh Murnet and Tiffani Bissette (Vicky in TV's ""Small Wonder"").

Just picture it: Mitch, C.J., Stephanie, Caroline, Matt and Logan going to a peaceful vacation in Hawaii...well you've guessed right... Its gonna get funky!!!. They get into so much trouble you can barley sit still. I myself had to pause it several times because I have a heart condition... but I survived.

Sir Hasselhoff (Yes I'll call him Sir from now on) gives a thrilling and heartwarming performance when David Charbet (in the role of Matt) gets stung by a poisonous scorpion fish. Immediately they get stranded at sea... and lord... that's when the acting begins. I don't want to compare it to Brando's greatest moments because it would be unfair... Sir Hasselhoff is much better. The multiple psychological deepness of his portrayal is groundbreaking, the character development of Mitch is like a perfectly crafted sculpture. I heard from a friend of mine (an assistant to the assistant director's assistant who was in the set the day that sequence was shot) that it only took one take for the master to accomplish such an emotional ride. The camerawork blends with wonderful written dialogue sparkled with great improvisational skills by Sir Hoff. Out of nowhere he improvises lines like: ""Oh my god!"" or the memorable: ""We've ran out of gas... (pause)  Damn!"" and finally: ""It's like a sauna in here""

Pamela Anderson's performance in the role of C.J. is as accurate as it can be: a flawless Stalivnaskyan character role. As if the great Lee Strasberg had entered the mind of director Douglas Schwartz, I can't wait to see how she did it in her upcoming visit to the Actors Studio.

It's great how this filmmaker accomplishes so much with this diverse and eclectic ensemble cast. Thank god he lived up to the challenge, a master director with a solid filmography, remember his TV work for ""Xena, Warrior Princes"", ""Baywatch: Hawaiian Wedding"" (released years later), the made for TV movie ""Dark Water"" and the unforgettable ABC special hosted by Bob Saget ""Americas Funniest Home Videos: When apes go ape""

So adjust the tracking of your VCR and open a space for this magnificent piece of moving image history...

(I'm just waiting for the release of the criterion collection special dvd with interviews with the actors and the director's commentaries. Some say it will have deleted scenes with Sir Hoff fighting a rubber hammer shark.)",1126224000,10,3023,5.103238866396761

8228827,5,6303444350,"Let me just start off by saying that, I am a very big fan of ""Baywatch"" but I am a huge fan of Yasmine Bleeth. I mean, come on, you can not honeslty tell me that, she is not the most prettiest person you have ever seen. On a scale of 1-10, I think she's a 11 & I really didn't want to see her leave the show, but she went on to bigger & better things. Good move on her part considering ""Baywatch Hawaii"" sucks, I watched the 1st episode & saw that it was not the same Baywatch, so I quite watching the new show. If Yasmine would join the cast of B.H, I would be a fan of the show again, but that will not happen. Sorry to see ""Titans"" is going off the air. Forbidden Paradise is a pretty neat movie, considering Yasmine's in it. Lots of pretty sceanary & colors. Ok story line, cool music. I would not really consider it a full leanth movie, since its only approx 80 minutes long & it was aired on tv as a Baywatch episode. All in all, it was very well done. I though Pamela did a ok job, David did a fine job also. I only noticed one slight flaw in the movie, it did not take place on the beaches of California. I like the beach sceanery when I watch the show. I don't know where this was filmed, but it was not on the beach. That's my review. YOU GO YASMINE!",978220800,,1260,3.906614785992218
