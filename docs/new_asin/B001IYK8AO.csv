8311542,4,B001IYK8AO,"This 105 minute documentary by Constantine Nasr highlights the beginning of films where ""bad guys"" dominate the story line.  Some of the earliest films, beginning with silent movies show how dominant actors like Lon Chaney could command the screen playing not so likeable characters.  Much of the documentary highlights 1931 and 1932 when gangster films were at their height.  Warner Bros. studios was a leader of the genre and they release critical and movie goer favorites like ""Little Caesar,"" ""The Public Enemy"" and ""Scarface.""

We see some emphasis as well on actors Edward G. Robinson, James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart.  We also learn how and why these films became so prominent.  Alec Baldwin handles the narration, but most of the documentary consists of film historians, critics and authors like Rudy Behlmer, Daniel Bubbeo, Bernard Dick, Molly Haskell, Richard Schickel and Leonard Maltin to add some interesting factoids.  We also hear from filmmakers like Mike Newell, Martin Scorsese, Terence Winter and Robert Benton to comment on some of their influences.

The film also has some clips of interviews with some of the men who made the films of the 30's and 40's like Howard Hawks, Mervyn LeRoy and Raoul Walsh.  Unfortunately, these and those of some of the actors, occupy little time in the film.  Still, this DVD adds some clarity on how those early films influenced those being made today.  It is available as a stand-alone DVD or as part of the ""Ultimate Gangster Collection"" set (""Little Caesar"" ""Public Enemy"" ""The Petrified Forest"" and ""White Heat"").",1390953600,2,1571,5.09765625

8311544,3,B001IYK8AO,"""Public Enemies - The Golden Age of the Gangster Film"" is a very detailed documentary on the gangster genre, rightly focusing on the product of the Warner Brothers and their famous trio of stars James Cagney, Humphrey Bogart and Edward G. Robinson. The doco uses all the usual historians who have provided commentaries to many of the DVDs of these films and that is the weakness. If you have watched the films, you will have heard most of it before and many of these commentators are very clearly knowledgable historians but often very boring speakers. The best bits are the pieces of interviews with such luminaries as that indispensible moll Joan Blondell and such directors as Raoul Walsh (""White Heat"") and William Wellman (""Public Enemy""). Trouble is, the excerpts just make you wish the complete interviews had been included. The doco does link the 30's films to the advent of the psychological film noir and the successors in the 70s and beyond, particularly the films of Martin Scorcese. This was when the censorship finally collapsed and raw violence became a compulsory but not necessarily better component of the films.

The DVD includes 4 very good cartoons which have some link to the gangster genre but again this is recycled material because the cartoons have already appeared on the DVDs of the films themselves. Unless you purchase this DVD as part of the Warner's Gangster Collection Volume 4 or you want to watch the documentary to learn about the genre before you watch the films themselves, I wouldn't bother.",1230336000,5,1530,4.930232558139535
