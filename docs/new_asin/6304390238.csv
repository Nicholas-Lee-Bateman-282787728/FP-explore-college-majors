875525,5,6304390238,"The film Homo Faber is based upon the classic bestseller book by the same name written by the Swiss writer Max Frisch and adapted for the screen by screenwriters Rudi Wurlitzer and Volker Schlndorff with Schlndorff as director. The story of Homo Faber, meaning ""the man who creates his own destiny"" begins in 1957 but make convincingly flashbacks in sepia tone to the war years in Zurich Switzerland where Faber meets the young Jewish girl Hannah and fall in love with her. Hannah gets pregnant with Faber, tells him about the good news and discovers to her disbelief that Faber sees the pregnancy as very inconvenient to him now that he has received a tempting business proposal to head the building of a hydro electric dam in one of the third world countries.  Hannah gets an emotional chock and rejects Faber from the bottom of her heart. In anger and disappointment she now turns to Joachim (played by August Zirner) a common student friend of theirs for support and he marries the pregnant Hannah. (But Faber does not know this then)With a psychological thriller-like opening the story has set the tragic undercurrent which runs through the rest of the film like a dark river.

The role of Faber is genuinely well played by the American actor Sam Shepard. Faber is a man of sciences who believes only in what is calculable and rational, he distrusts emotions and those things happening by chance.

On a flight from Caracas, Venezuela to New York Faber's plane has to ditch down in the Mexican desert due to fire in two of the plane's four propeller engines. While in the Mexican desert Faber coolly opens his travel typewriter and sits down to write a letter of goodbye to his old New York girl friend Ivy (played with conviction by Deborah-Lee Furness). One of the fellow (and surviving) passengers is Herbert Henche (played by Dieter Kirchlechner) who happens to be the brother of Joachim from the student days in Zurich. Henche tells Faber that Joachim now owns a tobacco plantation in Central America and Faber decides to join him. Together they travel back to Central America to find Joachim. On arrival they sadly discover that Joachim has taken his own life. Upon returning to New York Faber is surprised to know that his old flame Ivy has created a special welcoming dinner for two in his apartment (she had a spear key) and she pushes Faber to make a commitment to her. This however is Faber's worst nightmare and he flees. He instantly books a ticket on a passenger ship headed for France. On board Faber meets the young and exciting woman Sabeth (played charmingly by Julie Delpy) and is instantly attracted to her. They fall in love and Faber offers to drive her to Rome where she will study art.  In Italy they live out their romance among beautiful buildings and art. But now the dark undercurrent in the theme forces its way through and in a chocking revelation Faber now discovers that Sabeth is actually his daughter with Hannah, the unborn child he once, according to Hannah, ""found inconvenient"" to have and rejected.  With an ugly twist of faith Faber takes Sabeth with him to Greece for a hollyday; it will prove to be their last together. Sabeth dies abruptly; Faber by chance meets Hannah again, also in Greece. There is a brief, but dark reunion between them as Hanna learn about Faber's involvement with Sabeth, their common child.

The film Homo Faber is a fiest for the eyes, beautifully shot in many countries on three continents. With stunning sceneries like the ones of the four engine air plane, the wide fields in Italy and inside the Louvre Museum in Paris, just to mention a few. With his book Homo Faber, Max Frisch re-created a universal theme; the filmed version of the  book extends this best seller to an even wider audience.

875526,5,6304390238,"This is a movie that will stay with you [maybe forever?]--I first saw it on Bravo about 1994, recorded it and have shared it with lots of friends. It is possible to figure out the ending about halfway through but you hope that it is NOT what you think. You desperately want the couple to be happy because they both need each other. It proves that without the circumstances of the ending--a girl CAN be happy with a man 25 years older than her! This is common throughout Europe--it is only Americans who have a problem with it.",1134518400,2,526,4.377551020408164
875527,3,6304390238,"The book by Max Frisch (Homo Faber), latin for ""Man the Maker"", is the way to go here.  Frisch was an existentialist, not a Buddhist, as someone earlier asserted.  It is the story of modern man who believes in instrumental reason and has trouble with romantic or subjective feelings.  Great book that can't really be made into an effective movie.",1118880000,2,346,4.733333333333333
875528,4,6304390238,"Ever since Before Sunrise and Before Sunset, Julie Delpy had became probably my top 10 European actresses. I have already seen some of her earlier works including Three Colours: White,  An American Werewolf in Paris, and listened to her self-titled Album. Recently, I am tring to watch more of her pre-famous movies, and I ended up seeing her in Voyager, a film she starred opposite veteran American actor Sam Sherpard, and she was probably just 20 years old in it, looking beautiful, fragile, and vulnerable. Like her fellow French actress Juliette Binoche, one of the Divas of Three Colours, also made a disturbing sexual and love film called Damage(Jeremy Iron) more than a decade ago, a film which was far too heavy-duty for me digest at the time, Voyager will no doubt leave a strong mark to her fans whether they like it or not.

The story took place in the '50s, and it's the voyager of an American in Europe played by Sam Sheperd. In the begining, we see his flashbacks of some events and characters that involved him a few decades earlier. He meets a pretty young French girl(Julie Delpy) on a ferry, and they instantly established a strong conection that eventually lead to intimacy. Julie Delpy fell in love with him after a while without revealing enough details of her profile. The days and nights they shared were erotic, introspective, and happy, but the closer they got to each other, the shocking truth was inevitable to reveal itself to the unawared Shepard when he learned about her mother's identity, and the remain of the film's tone will be turned upside down from that moment on....

Delpy's signature ability as seen here and Before Sunset is that she looks vulnerable and she acts that way perfectly, that's why she's so real and captivating. This is a hard and tragic role to play, and to some viewers it might be disgusting, but things like this(unintensional incest) do happen in real life. I don't think she was anymore unlikeable here than White where she played a nasty newly wed. Being a victim of an unawared circumstance is purely innocent. OK, so she has a thing for father-figure and goes for older men, that's her right to chose.

Even though Sam Sheperd anchors this film from start to finish, and he was great especially near the end, it's Delpy who gave a more heartbreaking performance, and she was so young at the time!",1111190400,7,2361,4.723300970873787
875529,5,6304390238,"This is Sam Shepard's type of film, very well made, and ilegal love. Recommended.",1083974400,,81,4.857142857142857
875530,5,6304390238,"I think that this movie is so good that it almost defies meaningful description.  Sam Shepherd plays the disemotional professional Faber, seemingly childless and the detached manner of the Charles Aznavor role in  ""Shoot the Piano Player"". Yet, he is forced into an emotional  involvment (even prior to the realization that Julie Delpy is his daughter)  by his need to protect such a delicate creature from the dangers of life,  hitchiking across Europe and from less-pure young men. Every nuance seems  thought out carefully, such as his picking the name of Sabet, which is  close to Sabbath or the day of rest in several religions.  The story, which  is retold in other places in the reviews at this site, is simply amazing  and reflects on the most personal basis how one person's strong will can  affect the lives of so many.
Like Aznavor in ""Shoot the Piano  Player"", Faber cannot remain aloof and the sadness cannot be  alieviated by any human actions of which he could have taken to remain  uninvolved.  Yet, this is not an ultimately sad story, in my view.  There  is something so strong and uplifting in the short experience of Faber with  his daughter, one believes he will go on to become more into life's  experiences after the movie ends.
One final note, I don't think the movie  really has a 1950's feel, the time that it takes place ; it is much more of  a late 60's to  70's movie in how the characters act.",946857600,8,1423,4.608
7871043,4,6304390238,"""Voyager"" (1991) is directed by Volker Schlondorff (The Tin Drum). This is a film about an engineer , Walter Faber (Sam Shepard), who through a series of coincidences finds himself meeting a young woman (Julie Delpy) on a transatlantic voyage. They then cross Europe together developing a love for one another until Walter makes a discovery about her which will change their lives. This film has a slow pace and a gentle melancholic jazz score which recreates the relaxed atmosphere of a reflective time in Walter's life where he is learning to enjoy life again through the eyes of this vibrant young woman as they enjoy the pleasures of travel together. This is a gently somber film that balances lives joys with its disappointments.

The DVD is of a good quality with a 16x9 (1.78:1) widescreen master that fills completely one's TV screen which helps to accentuate the scenic shots of Europe.",1427500800,,895,4.8881578947368425

7871045,5,6304390238,"This is a film which I watched when first released in the late 1990s - and which I only had a video tape version.  So to have a DVD version is a real treat.
For fans of Lockheed Constellation aircraft, this film is a must.  Great shots of the aircraft.
Otherwise, fans of Sam Shepard will love finding him in another of his often-characteristic no-win situations.  Fortunately for him, fate - or the script writer -  finds a convenient way out for him (at Julie Delpy's character's expense).",1401667200,,491,4.545454545454546
7871046,2,6304390238,"I'm a fan of Julie Delpy from the Before Sunrise trilogy and bought this movie because of all the rave reviews.  I loved seeing her in this film from so many years ago and thought her performance was very good in a mature movie, BUT, this is a very WEIRD movie with a very WEIRD ending.  It's so disturbing and disgusting that it killed the enjoyment of just a good romance which is what I was looking for.  I guess that's not ""artsy"" enough for these German-style Directors and the mentally damaged critics that are looking for some psychologically disturbing story to convince the rest of us to unknowingly imbibe.  All I can say is that I cannot in good moral conscience recommend such a story, it has absolutely no pay-off, redemption or saving grace.  Very disturbing, these kinds of movies should never be financed.  If you must know the reason (spoiler) it's because romance that's actually incest, coupled with the sudden death of the unknowing victim doesn't provide any meaning, validation or closure for an already demented third act.  Just for seeing Julie Delpy when she was younger and enjoying her interview in the bonus features, maybe it was worth it.  But I have my second thoughts for the reasons already expressed.  Beware.",1384905600,,1243,4.771028037383178

I would like to revisit some of these films, but not until I see Julie Delpy in Greece before midnight on my HDTV.
I love riding the Greek ferries from island to island, watching the Greek men ogling the Swedish girls as they come ashore, while sipping their ouzo.",1370736000,,439,4.365853658536586
7871048,5,6304390238,"This movie has a very different twist as far as dramas go, but very good, and definately one for your collection.",1366329600,,113,4.428571428571429
7871049,5,6304390238,"If you can forgive a film based upon obvious coincidences to voyage into a regretful past,and a film maker who's prepared to take on a challenge,this is for you. Faber(Shepherd)had fallen out in his youth with the first woman he loved and deserted, Hannah(Sukowa)due to her becoming pregnant and him offering her marriage for `your baby'. Furious,Hannah instead marries their best friend Joachim. Faber is unable to work with feelings and emotions only probabilities. But fate intervenes when he meets a German,Henke,the brother of Joachim. They become stranded in the Mexican desert by a plane crash. Henke takes him to see his own best friend in the jungle,but find Joachim has committed suicide.

Seeing this movie 20 years ago stayed with me until I bought the DVD to relive again that experience. Based upon a novel Homo Faber by Max Fritsch. What I remember most was the world-weary nature of Walter,his detachment from and control of nature and the environment,as a globe-trotting engineer,whose world view based on logic,probability, and technology is challenged when he falls victim to fate, or a series of incredible coincidences. Walter narrates with voiceover. We view the world and other characters through Walter's eyes.

The freshness and spontaneity of Julie Delphy creates the innocence of Sabeth. Walter falls in love with this young girl he sees by chance,he catches the flick of her pony-tail in his cine-camera on board a ship crossing from America to France. She loves the arts,reads Camus and the existentialists. She wants to see ancient civilizations. The film captures the moment of falling in love well. Faber is concerned about Sabeth hitch-hiking to Italy,so he takes her by car. They make love in a motel,leading down a spiral to the destruction of the life of his own daughter. The tragedy is themes of incest are mixed in with Walter's rebirth as a romantic believer.

Although aspects of the movie come across as far-fetched because the viewer cannot benefit from the additional information available to the reader of the book. However the movie has a grandeur and sweep,great acting superb camerawork,the movie brings across the immediacy of the tragic events much closer to home and resonate with a receptive audience. The novel and this movie try to show that life cannot be reduced to a simple formula and that the mind is not equipped to deal with the matters of the heart. The film moved me by its globe-trotting finesse and its un-Hollywoodised glamour. Sabeth's image is relived in Faber's cine-film, a film within a film. The 50s ambience is beautiful,the Oedipal tragedy at its heart heart-breaking. This opened up world cinema for me.",1351814400,2,2678,5.068027210884353
7871050,5,6304390238,Homo Faber is one of my all-time favorite novels. I was skeptical that the movie wouldn't live up to the book (despite the director and cast). But it turned out to be one of those rare movies that successfully captures the original spirit of the author. Great love story.,1305590400,3,271,4.551020408163265

You will love the scenery, the actors, their acting, the love, the drama, simply stated a great story.

7871052,5,6304390238,"Without going much further into detail about the storyline that was previously given by someone else, I'd like to comment on the overall concept of the movie and its main characters. Beautifully shot on location in various locales in Europe helped to give the characters more depth in their surroundings. Sam Shepard and Julie Delpy were very convincing as tender lovers in this haunting and thought provoking story.
In reality, this subject matter would naturally have herendous repercussions. Though its characters are gripped by what has happened, the film makes you FEEL for the two lovers and the girl's mother. Total escapism for the senses yet mind blowing!
I saw this film about 7 years ago on cable tv and later purchased the video. I am so
happy that it has finally been released on DVD! I have now purchased this format and
anticipate seeing the deleted scences, etc. It's near the top of my all time favorite films!",1282262400,11,927,4.836477987421383
