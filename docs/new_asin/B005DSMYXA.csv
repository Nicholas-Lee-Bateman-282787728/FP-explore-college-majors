8467396,1,B005DSMYXA,"This is a scam, all 3 DVD discs play the same simple piano bit, over and over!  I could take it if it were Mozart's work, but this is not work, it's crap. 0 STARS!!!
Non-duality simply means one. So, maybe they are selling to all the intellectuals who will fall for it...
I'm glad I only paid $1.68 plus tax for it (threw them out) and not the over $30.
I was hoping for a series of lectures.",1397606400,,392,3.962025316455696
8467397,5,B005DSMYXA,"Being relatively new to the study of non-duality, I can't give a review like many of the deeply well informed reviews I've read here on Amazon on this subject. I lack both the insight and the experience to do so. I can say that watching these Western Masters speak, made me feel like I was sitting in my living room, visiting with old friends, as they shared their insights with me. When I noticed there were no reviews on this set of DVD's, I felt compelled to at least take the time to share some information that this listing doesn't contain.

The production values are excellent, and the twelve people interviewed are; Francis Lucille, Rupert Spira, Greg Goode, Jeff Foster, James Swartz, Chuck Hillig, Joel Morwood, Vijay Kapoor, Stephen Wolinsky, Loch Kelly, Loibon Le Baaba and Peter Fenner.

They each answer the same 12 questions.

1. What motivates you to teach?

2. What is your definition of Non-Duality?

3. What is the cause of suffering?

4. What is self inquiry?

5. Is there a difference between awareness and consciousness?

6. What advice would you give someone seeking the self?

7. Is a living teacher or guru necessary?

8. Is there such a thing as enlightenment? If so, what is it?

9. Is there a difference between enlightenment and self-realization?

10. Are there qualifications for those seeking enlightenment?

11. What is the truth of the world?

12. Is there one thing you can say for certain about the truth?

I initially thought that listening to the same questions being asked repeatedly, had a potential to become pretty boring after a while, but I was completely wrong on that one. It was like watching twelve different artists, painting a similar canvas, each using their own unique palette of colors and technique.  I pick up something new every time I watch it. I believe there's a good possibility that whether you're just starting a study of non-duality, or have been at it for years, there are things presented here that will lead you down a path, perhaps you haven't fully explored yet.

Thank you to Chris Hebard and his staff at Stillness Speaks for their efforts in producing such a worthwhile and valuable resource of this information. Thank you also to each of the participants who shared their knowledge so effortlessly, and with such grace.",1391731200,5,2289,4.798469387755102
