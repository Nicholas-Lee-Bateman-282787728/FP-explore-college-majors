2599163,5,B000G1R40M,"Ellen Degeneres is back with her 4 Season of her Sitcom. This Season has many great guest stars, espically in the episode ""The Puppy Episode"". This Season has 25 great episodes, and it has audio commentaries o the Puppy Episode, by the writer.",1149638400,10,243,4.674418604651163
2599174,5,B000G1R40M,"Ellen Season 4  has to be the best. The writing and the comedy is amazing. This season has very touching episodes with a strong emotional attachment. Ellen is nothing like sitcoms in the '90s or even today. Watching Ellen gives a new feeling; not an outdated look like most sitcoms of this time will give today. I love this show and this DVD is worth watching over and over. I would recomend this show to people who don't even find Ellen DeGeneres funny because this show would change their mind. If you think her talkshow is funny than you'll love this, it's a lot funnier.",1277683200,2,574,4.466666666666667
2599175,5,B000G1R40M,"What can I say I Love this show. I love Ellen herself, Joley Fisher, Jeremy Previn

and the whole cast.",1249948800,,103,4.15
2599176,5,B000G1R40M,"I really liked Ellen's show,but the forth season was the best for me,when ellen lets it all out,and ended the show by comming out.
The Best one is  with Emma Thompson. I played this one  over and over again,and love it when Emma comes out to the world that she was born in Dayton Ohio,but  the big suprise is when Sean Penn comes out at the end of the show.
I also liked the black and white 50's flashback final.",1227225600,,412,4.125
2599177,5,B000G1R40M,This was the best of the Ellen series throughout its 5 year run. There was something really magically about this season despite the fact that every time you saw Entertainment Tonight it was speculating if the character was coming out the closet or not for an entire year of news coverage. That was the news that was covered all year round till the final infamous coming out episode. It was INSANE the news COVERAGE! Season 3 was really great also and overall this was just a great show. But something really magical about the comedy and the way the CREW just clicked made this season great and stand out from the rest. The storyline were funny and crazy also. Ellen's sense of HUMOR is just on POINT in this season. The relationship between Paige & Spence was also what made the series so great. The plots in this season was so do different as Ellen's world starts to just crumble from the announcement of her parents divorce to Ellen seeing a therapist. Unfortunately this would be the last time Ellen would be FUNNY! Season 5 was such a letdown and i have to agree it deserved to get cancel. I felt the storylines were not tackled well in terms of Ellen being a lesbian on the show. All the jokes seem to lose its magic. I guess COMEDY is better when it's based on speculation rather then the truth being revealed. Season 5 is still a must own for any fan but in all honesty it's a HUGE let down. After the stellar coming out episode in season 4 i was so looking forward to season 5 being 100 times better. Unfortunately that wasn't the case. I also didn't like the relationship between Ellen and her Girlfriend character on the show. They really should have cast someone else that had more chemistry with Ellen. Get this season before it goes out of PRINT. You'll laugh till you CRY and watching these episodes brings back many wonderful memories of the 90's.,1209600000,,1862,4.479411764705882
2599178,5,B000G1R40M,"Ten years ago, Ellen was a mid rated comedy, a ""female Seinfeld"" it was once described, about a group of friends living and loving in L.A. Season three&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ellen-The-Complete-Season-Three/dp/B000CRR35Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ellen - The Complete Season Three</a>hit its peak, with one of the funniest hour long episodes in the history of sitcoms, Paige's wedding. And then came the infamous season four, with the even more infamous hour on television ""The Puppy Episode"", which galvanized and turned the nation on its ear, and became the birthmother, intentionally or not.

I purchased season four of Ellen primarily to relive those days gone past, and see if the Puppy Episode held up to the previous ""genius"" season. And the good news is, it did. With all of the ""Ellen is gay"" hype gone, and the public thinking of her as more of a Oscar host and congenial television hostess, the episode stands alone now. The thing that is quickly apparent is how personal this show was to Ellen, as she herself comes out of the closet nationally, as her character comes out to her small group of friends. Both make significant impacts on their worlds, but Ellen's world was totally rocked. As she talks with counselor Oprah, she is both Ellen and Ellen Morgan, discussing and divulging the pain of coming out to millions of people who may have never realized how hard it is.

And what is even more surprising is how personal I took the show. It harkened me back to a time where I was struggling with these issues such as Ellen. I didn't take the time, surprisingly, to appreciate how similar she and I were, and how our shared experiences were so revolutionary. The episode itself was proof on how far we've come baby, and how far we have to go still.

Other than ""the episode"", the entire season plays out well. Many funny episodes are included in this collection, and you'll find yourself laughing out loud from one to another. You can't help but feel that each episode is bringing you one step closer to THE episode. And once that hits, you know you've just fallen into a new, and somewhat different show.

Ellen was courageous, and full of conviction to do what she did, when she did. Bravo to our funny lady, and thank you for teaching us, and taking us on an incredible ride.",1190678400,11,2345,4.899244332493703
2599179,5,B000G1R40M,We own them all and love every one.  Can't get enough of this series - wish it went on longer.,1173484800,3,94,3.7
2599180,5,B000G1R40M,I really enjoyed this season of Ellen.  She is hilarious.  Each season gets better and better.  This season also had the groundbreaking coming out episode.  It was a good season and look forward to Season 5.,1168387200,2,207,4.666666666666667
2599181,5,B000G1R40M,"I must say Ellen's 4th season was probably one of her best, because her coming out as a lead gay character was groundbreaking! I just loved the way she poked fun with the gay innuendo during most of the episodes that lead to her actually coming ""out"". The fourth season also included alot of really funny episodes involving her parents separation, Joe's sugarmama Florence Henderson, and Ellen going to the rock and roll fantasy camp starring Aaron Neville and Bonnie Raitt! I'm so looking forward to the release of the fifth and final season!!!",1161216000,7,545,4.808510638297872
2599182,4,B000G1R40M,"This show has some of the funniest, most endearing and engaging human interactions to be found on a sitcom. This is where Ellen starts taking risks, letting the story line of the show become  raw and edgy as the main character ""comes out"" to us as gay.  Not surprisingly, now that Ellen the person is no longer unconsciously censoring herself, the show blossoms. This new Ellen has a presence and energy that the other, the acting ""normal"" Ellen, did not.  Coming out frees Ellen the actress and it is revealed in her body language and expressions, demonstrating true comic genius.",1155859200,6,581,4.79

8128716,5,B000G1R40M,"I love Ellen seasons one through four.  Very funny stuff.  And yes, the coming out was well done.  Ellen quitting the book shop was very poignant.  It was season four that should have ended the series.",1373846400,2,201,4.5

8128719,5,B000G1R40M,"very good quality, sound and picture very good, but if ur getting it from another country, you will need a very good multi function player that plays all regions, i have a pioneer player, it automatically loads a movie without a code,

when i played it on a friends, LG player, the picture was out of sync with the audio, so even though my friends player is multi, it is the brand often that makes the difference",1304294400,,412,4.35064935064935
