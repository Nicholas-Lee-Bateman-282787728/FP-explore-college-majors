7987651,3,B00008WT5T,"The concept of this project - interviewing successful musicians/performers for advice about gigging - in and of itself is a good idea, however, the project is very dated. The DVD release says 2003, but the copyright and the end of the program reads 1999. No disrespect intended to those interviewed, but many of the ""talking heads"" had me asking myself, ""Who is that?"" Also, several people kept talking about having a demo tape, and passing your cassette around, and having a VHS tape available - formats that are rarely used today. Only a few references were made about the Internet. This is not to say there is nothing to gain from the project. Comments about working hard and being persistent are relevant no matter what year it is. But overall the suggested technologies and performing opportunities are dated.",1281744000,,814,4.905797101449275
