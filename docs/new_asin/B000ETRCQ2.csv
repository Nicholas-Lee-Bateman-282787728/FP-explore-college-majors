It is much better than Cali Swangin and infinitely better than LA Street Life volume 4.  It's much more amateur feeling but that gives it a street feeling.  I definitely recommend it to street life and lowriding enthusiasts.",1304726400,2,455,6.947368421052632

If you're loving the lowriding scene, you'll be digging the DVD ""Lowriding in Aztlan.""  This movie gots everything you want, from the hot chicas, candy painted 64's three wheelin around the corner, to even hardcore rivalries between lowriding clubs, northern Cali definitely comes hard in this DVD.  If you're one of those cats that considers your car to be your canvas, I definitely suggest you go out and check out this film.
