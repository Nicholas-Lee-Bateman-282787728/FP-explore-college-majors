898843,4,630456161X,"While not as groundbreaking as the first Casper, A Spirited Beginning is a well done attempt to ""fill in the blanks"" of the original and tell a full story about the past of Casper and his uncles. More comical and  light-hearted than the original, this movie is perhaps even more impressive  as far as visual effects ar concerned. If you sympathise with Casper et al,  you probably won't be disappointed.",913075200,5,403,4.728571428571429

898946,3,630456161X,"If you liked ""Casper"" the movie, this will probably disappoint you. The guality of the cinematography and CGI is well below that of the movie. It's quickly apparent this is a made-for-tv video. The storyline is so-so.  I'll just say my 8 and 10 year old grandsons watched the ""Casper"" movie at least 3 times and seemed to enjoy it. We played ""A Spirited Beginning"" for them and they lost interest after 25 minutes or so. Take that for what it's worth.",1413417600,,451,4.5

I love the animation in correlation with the human characters. The animated bits are synched perfectly into the movie making it a great watch and you don't really think about the real and animated characters being any different. I love the humor of this movie and it is just a fun watch. It is great to see Casper make a friend that is just like him: a lonely little boy.

899035,5,630456161X,"I remember watching the Capser movies when I was a little girl in the 90s. I like them most of the capser movies NOT including the stupid Christmas Casper, but Casper a Spirited Beginning and Casper Meets Wendy are my all time favorites. Its sort of a prequel to the Christina Ricci film Casper. Casper at first doesn't know that he's dead and he skips ghost training school that the train is going too. But when he goes into town people start screaming Ahh Ghost!!! Casper doesn't realize why people are screaming at him until he realizes that hes the ghost everyone screams at. Later on he befriends Chris Carson a lonely boy whose father is to busy working to hang out with him and be involved in his life, and is bullied by Broc and his crew. In fact Casper is his only friend. Soon afterwords Chris introduces Casper to the Ghostly Trio Stretch, Stinky and Fatso and they try to teach Casper how to be a scary ghost but Casper finds it hard because he doesn't want to scare people he would rather be friendly and nice to humans. This movie is hilarious when Casper and Chris get the bully Broc in trouble. I won't give away too much for people who've never seen it. But its a great film for all ages. When its on t.v. I still watch it and I'm 19 and I was 5 when this movie came out in 1997 and remember watching it over and over again. If you're a fan of Casper and Casper Meets Wendy I recommend this film!",1318982400,,1413,4.256505576208179
899036,4,630456161X,"Casper: A Spirited Beginning Dvd is very good. It is very funny, and people of all ages would like it. Although it is not as good as the first Casper Movie, I would still recommend it to just about anybody.",1281052800,3,206,4.175

899094,5,630456161X,I use to have this movie on vhs and I recently purchased a copy on dvd. I totally forgotten  how great and fun this movie is. I use to watch Casper cartoons and just loved this little character. The movie is just as wonderful as the cartoons. You will love the special effects and you will fall in love with Casper. The dvd special features includes a Casper cartoon. If you have children {or even if you don't} order this one and sit back and have some laughs.,1174089600,2,461,4.238636363636363
899095,1,630456161X,"To start out with, this is another one of those typical, cheap, grownups-are-stupid; kids-are-smart movies. This is nothing like the first movie. If this is how it all began then it does not tie in with the feature film Casper the Friendly Ghost.
How can a ten-year-old boy, who is in the 4th grade, be smarter than his 40-year-old-dad, who is a successful architect? What happened to Casper's father, who lived in a completely other part of the country, and the big scary mansion? It doesn't make any sense. This is a disgrace to the friendly phantom.
The acting in this movie is at an all time low. They got low paid actors for a low paid movie. All of the horrible acting, sets, story, and CG make this movie the definition of a terrible movie. Should you watch this junk you will discover the dreadfulness of this piece of trash.",1011052800,6,833,4.52317880794702
899096,3,630456161X,"The following review has been updated since I upgraded from my VHS to the ""Casper: A Spirited Beginning"" DVD:

There have been a handful of direct-to-video Casper films ever since the release of the big budget, bigscreen ""Casper"" from 1995, produced by Stephen Spielberg and starring Bill Pullman and Christina Ricci. They started with this film, ""Casper: A Spirited Beginning"", which initially appears to be a prequel, but actually seems to disregard the Ricci movie altogether (Casper's home has a different name and is in a different town). After that came ""Casper Meets Wendy"", followed by the completely computer animated features I have yet to see. Between ""A Spirited Beginning"" and ""Casper Meets Wendy"", I tend to prefer ""Casper Meets Wendy"", probably because it's more of a comedy and the story is more supernatural and interesting, adding witches and warlocks to the mix and making it perfect Halloween viewing. It also stars Hilary Duff in her earliest role that I know of, and coincidentally, she along with Ricci were two of my biggest celeb crushes, but I digress. ""Casper: A Spirited Beginning"" just continues with the ghost stuff, which we already saw done much better in the Ricci movie. Nevertheless, it is a cute little film for kids that ""kids at heart"" like myself can still find some enjoyment in. The acting in general might be better here than in ""Casper Meets Wendy"", thought it's still a mixed bag and they are really camping it up on purpose in ""Casper Meets Wendy"". There is an amateurish quality with both films, and ""A Spirited Beginning"" may be worse, especially in one early scene where the young star of the film is caught talking to someone off camera... Sad, but you learn to overlook those things in direct-to-video releases, ha.

As for the plot, Chris is a little boy who has moved to a new town. He's a supernatural/scifi nut with no friends. Casper is a freshly dead ghost with no friends, so they take comfort in each other. Steve Guttenburg, always a fave of mine, plays Chris' Dad. He's a workaholic, and so Chris is extra frustrated about that. It's a simple plot about Chris and Casper making friends, overcoming bullies, and bonding with Dad, and then there's Kibosh (voiced by James Earl Jones), a boss ghost who is after Casper for skipping Ghost training. Romantic sparks also fly between Guttenberg and Chris' new teacher, who are at odds over the impending demolition of a historic old house in which Casper and the Ghostly Trio live. Everything is pretty basic and predictable, the usual family, straight to video stuff. The effects are not bad, but nothing compared to the Ricci movie. A bit more cartoony, I guess. Pauly Shore voices a sidekick character for Kibosh, but he is better (less annoying) in ""Casper Meets Wendy"" in live-action as the Magic Mirror. Basically, this is an interesting film that isn't that boring, albeit predictable. Kids should enjoy it without getting bored though, and especially Casper fanatics. Don't consider it the prequel it was originally marketed as. This one sets a whole new beginning for Casper and doesn't go into details about who he was and how he died, though it seems to pick up right after his death(making it seem that he died in modern day and not the Victorian era, like in the Ricci film). If you like Casper, I'd say get both this AND ""Casper Meets Wendy"", but please don't expect some big budget thing. This is a direct-to-video film, and no one has any right to complain that a direct-to-video film is not as good as the big budget, bigscreen feature it spun off from. If you enjoy Halloween specials and kids' TV shows from the 90's, there's a good idea of what to expect from this. Don't get me wrong, this does neither of this one, nor ""Casper Meets Wendy"", use Halloween as a setting, and that's too bad, but they still are great October/Halloween entertainment. Pick them up along with the Fairuza Balk/Tim Curry film ""The Worst Witch"", the Halloween MUST-HAVE: ""Hocus Pocus"", the Ricci ""Casper"" movie, Jim Henson's ""The Witches"", and of course, ""It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown"" and any version of ""Sleepy Hollow"" you can get your hands on(especially the old Disney animated one), and you're well set for the Halloween season.

Oh, the DVD for ""Casper, A Spirited Beginning"" is fullscreen and holds one bonus feature, but it's a good one. It's the 1951 animated Casper short, ""Boo Hoo Baby"". Cute little cartoon and a happy inclusion. ""Casper: A Spirited Beginning"" was released in 1997, two years after the bigscreen film. Some packagings of ""Casper: A Spirited Beginning"", like mine, are packaged with a free Casper trick or treat bag, though it doesn't appear to be one strong enough that I would feel confident using myself, ha. My DVD case does not say ""Special Edition"" at the top, as one of the Amazon product listings of this film depicts. If there is any difference in the content though, I'd be surprised. Mine does have the cover imagery that includes the father and teacher characters, which the very first edition released does not have.",1006819200,13,5068,4.8229885057471265

899098,4,630456161X,"Although I enjoyed the first CASPER movie the best, A SPIRITED BEGINNING is just as good. It's pretty different from the first movie, too. There are hardly any similarities except for maybe the ghosts. In this one, Casper is back and this time he comes across an 11-year-old boy who is very interested in ghosts and the Supernatural. So interested, that some people may think he's obsessed with the stuff. His father, unfortunately, doesn't seem to have enough time to spend with him because he's always rushing around...working. The boy is the only one in town who isn't afraid of Casper and they end up becoming friends. Casper and his three uncles still live in the mansion...but the boy's father is making plans with the governer of the town to tear old mansion down to turn the land into a shopping mall! The rest of the town - started by the boy's school teacher - started a fight in order to save the house for historical reseasons. This is a fun movie and the kid in the movie is kinda cute, too. If you liked the first CASPER, than A SPIRITED BEGINNING is for you. I wouldn't recommend any of the other CASPER movies - those all stunk - but these are the only two really good, worth-while movies.",986342400,11,1205,4.506849315068493

7874133,1,630456161X,"I totally hate this movie after seeing it back as a kid, this movie was by far the worst, with a stupid story, forgettable characters including some stars in this stinker including Steve Guttenberg, Lori Loughlin, Michael McKean, Richard Moll, Sherman Hemsley of the Jeffersons, Ben Stein as a Grocer, Edie McClurg as the Libraian, Pauly Shore as the voice of Snivel, James Earl Jones as the voice of Kibosh and of course Rodney Dangerfield as the Mayor of Deedstown, terrible cgi of Casper and the other ghost look like something Pixar was animated at the time back when they did commercials and went on to make Toy Story, but more like something right out a PlayStation 2 game back when the first PlayStation console was around in the mid and late 90s and some of the songs aren't that great though! so instead i'm sticking with the original Casper movie from 1995 which is my Halloween Tradition so far and it isn't over yet when somebody ends up buying a copy of casper: a spirited beginning either both VHS or DVD and smash it with a Sledge Hammer, just like with George Lucas who would track down bootleg copies of the Star Wars Holiday Special!",1490313600,,1151,4.592233009708738
