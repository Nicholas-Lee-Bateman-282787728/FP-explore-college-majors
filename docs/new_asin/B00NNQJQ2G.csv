8679351,5,B00NNQJQ2G,"I'm not going to lie... I've been a little obsessed with Mr. Murphy since the mid-80's (even sporting an awful widow's peak hairdo circa '88).  I was pretty sure the guy could do no wrong musically, and every live show I've seen (both solo and Bauhaus) have been amazing.  This DVD is no different.  It's an amazing set that was performed with precision and energy...

My one problem... after reading http://smile.amazon.com/Who-Killed-Mister-Moonlight-Benediction/dp/1908279664/ref=pd_sim_mov_2?ie=UTF8&refRID=1Z8JG8C2YZSCWHHSM16N (Who Killed Mister Moonlight?: Bauhaus, Black Magick, and Benediction), my opinion of Murphy is altered.  I had a hard time enjoying the show after reading David J's book...

It would be unfair to rate this show any less than 5 stars because of this detail.  It's not Peter's fault that my hero worship switch was flipped off.  It's an amazing performance and worth watching if you are fan of the music.",1418169600,3,935,5.535211267605634
