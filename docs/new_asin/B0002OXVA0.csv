2111810,4,B0002OXVA0,"""The Inevitable Defeat of Mister & Pete"" (2013 release; 108 min.) brings the story of two young boys in the Brooklyn housing projects. As the movie opens, we see Mister flunking his last exam on the final day of his 8th grade school year, and the teacher tells him he'll have to do 8th grade over again. As Mister gets home, we get to know his mom, a drug addict and prostitute who seemingly only cares about the next high. We also meet Pete, a Korean-American kid who is even younger but is staying there as his mom is in equally bad shape (if not worse). As the summer unfolds, Mister's mom eventually also gets arrested, and now Mister and Pete are left alone. Mister thinks/expects that his mom will be released in a few days, two weeks tops, but when she does not return, the boys need to find a way to survive. One thing that keeps Mister going are the auditions coming up in early August for a movie or TV show. Will the boys make it through the summer? Will Mister's mom return? What about Pete's mom? To tell you more would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourseld how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first and foremost, this is a tough urban family drama that will not leave you unmoved. One can't but feel terrible for the two boys. They didn't ask for these circumstances. but they neverhtless have to deal with it. At one point Pete asks Mister if it's okay not to love his mom. Mister wistfully responds: ""You can't help but love her but that doesn't mean you have to like her"". Wow. As you can expect, there are lots of notable performances in thsi movie, none more so than newcomer Skylan Brooks as Mister. But Jennifer Hudson as Mister's mom will equally blow you away. When everything is falling apart, she cries out to Mister ""I'm just trying to get things in order"" and your heart aches for her and for Mister. Jordin Sparks as a small but notable role as Alice, Mister's former neighbor who has moved on yet still cares for Mister. Alicia Keys is listed both as an Executive Producer and music co-composer (along with Mark Isham).

Imagine my surprise when this movie opened last month without any pre-release hype or advertizing on 2 screens for all of Greater Cincinnati. I was traveling and was afraid I was going to miss it, but thankfully the movie stuck around long enough. The screening I saw this at was, given the movie's difficult material, reasonably well attended, I'm glad to say. If you are in the mood for an outstanding family drama that is MILES away from your standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go with this, and I strongly suggest you check this out, be it in the theatre or on DVD/Blu-ray. ""The Inevitable Defeat of Mister & Pete"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1384473600,67,2735,4.48995983935743
2111811,5,B0002OXVA0,"I Can't believe they made a DVD ON THIS!!! I love POMPEII PETE! HE was the bomb when I was a child. I always watched the show just to watch him! As for those of you who are looking up Tex Avery, there is a show called the Wacky world of Tex Avery, thus the Cowboy of the show is named TEx Avery, its not the cartoonist Tex Avery, but the character himself himself is Tex Avery.",1221609600,2,377,3.909090909090909

Everything was well done and the acting was phenomenal...I must admit it may be a little unrealistic for the police to repeatedly go to the apartment and not just go in and get the boys sooner but other than that it was entertaining and heartbreaking. I was pleased with the ending!,1451433600,,307,4.5
2111954,5,B0002OXVA0,This movie looks so sad so depressing and so intuitive I had to buy it. This movie drawn my attention and once it came through the mail I popped it into my DVD player and got to work on them tears because this movie had me cry,1451260800,,226,3.8297872340425534

2111956,5,B0002OXVA0,"I saw this film via cable. This film is about real life in which it shows the harshness and the hopefulness of the main two male characters. Mister and Pete portray hope, survival, a much needed dependence on the possible true good in life like friendship and family, if one has it, and humanity. This film shows the ugliness in the world that doesn't let up because Mister and Pete are under age 18, and this film also shows a fight usually from Mister for both himself and Pete. This film will not disappoint in terms of entertainment but it will also touch your core, assuming you would let it touch your heart. The title of the film touches on the possibility of what could happen to these two characters; however, both the characters Pete and Mister fight against the inevitable defeat which another character spoke against them. Unfortunately, this story is very true and is a possibility for everyone in the planet especially since so many people are living that life, some that like it and others that don't. I am very sure that no child wants to live that life filled with responsibilities that are not theirs and trying to be a child while ""wearing"" adult size shoes, so to speak. This is a good film, in my opinion, without stereotypes being pushed in your face or some of the flaws that many films have. I don't know how this film done in the box office but this film is worth the watch, especially for boys who choose to do wrong and be evil because their circumstances are not so pleasant.  To readers of this review:  If you personally know members of Congress and lawmakers, please have them watch this film which can, in my opinion, guide them on what laws to pass and what laws to remove or improve. Children should not have to suffer because of the poor choices there poor example of parents have made. They are the main victims because of adults' decisions which are poorly made and improperly carried out affecting the youth who did ask for the problems but are pushed into it and made to live accordingly.",1449792000,,2027,4.53551912568306

2111963,5,B0002OXVA0,"Mister and Pete.  Didn't expect it to be what it was but I am glad I sat down and got pulled into the story.  I could not even begin to imagine what it would be like to walk in the shoes of anyone who would have to live the life Mister and Pete.  But hope is a powerful drug and I don't even think Mister knew he had it until he was came face to face with the inevitable.  He had to survive.  Skylan Brooks as Mister and Ethan Dizon  as his sidekick Pete both gave outstanding performances equally poignant.  One takes the lead, he is pushy, bold and daring and the other quietly follows, too afraid to do anything else and a friendship and a bond emerges.  Proving once again we need each other, we can't  make it alone.  FDJA",1449014400,,727,4.092198581560283

The two child leads were wonderful. Skylan Brooks should have been nominated for an award. Not many actors grown or otherwise, can pull all the weight of a movie as he did.

There is a deeper message in the film that will have you thinking and feeling for the characters in the movie. This movie has made me want to keep fighting when things get tough and I love how the movie ended. I love it and the ending seemed real, realistic and very hopeful. The movie was real but it still gave you hope at the same time. Some movies are so depressing without hope but not this movie.

2112158,5,B0002OXVA0,"How and why have I not heard of this movie?  This movie should be shown in all social studies classes.  It is a very poignant view from an inner city youth's perspective of the true struggle many face in urban society of the US.

Couldn't believe some people rated low, for those who thought it was too graphic or too dire, well wake up, this is the reality that people are actually living!  For someone who has helped raise a child of an addicted person, I have seen it.

Every angle of this film shows a story that needs to be told.  When people look at angry teens who don't seem to care about themselves or society....angry youth that are disrespectful, unsuccessful and sometimes violent.  Well, I think this film gives a perspective of what it's like to truly try to raise yourself in dire circumstances, no support, no trust...

Capitalist propaganda would have all believe that there is equal opportunity for all, no excuse if you don't overcome your circumstances because there are programs and schools and welfare....  being poor in this country is not just about finances and things...there is emotionally poor...spiritually poor... add to that neglect, abuse,consummate disappointment in life, and just plain bad luck!

Try to overcome when the entire system actually impedes success and growth of a human being

Acting on all levels was superb

I was balling and couldn't even speak while watching this movie.  My heart hurt!  My soul hurt!!
No one should have to grow up this way...no one would have to struggle alone

Wake up America... until we start to realize we need to be responsible for each other, including that section of society that don't seem to be able to reach their potential for whatever the various reasons...until we adopt a more socialist view....actually help one another....people will continue to struggle alone",1432166400,5,1848,4.878205128205129

2112161,5,B0002OXVA0,"In this movie, the screen writer and movie director thrust us into a world of not often mentioned in the main stream media outlets or if mentioned, is not always depicted in the crude way that director Anthony Mackie presents it to us. It is a world in which plagues like drug addiction, prostitution, poverty put their blindfolds in their eyes and strike indiscriminately across all races - black (the child main character named ""mister""), asian (the child character named Pete) and white (Pete's across the door female  neighbor) among the most vulnerable ones in our world. The character ""Mister"", left by his drug addict and prostitute mother (Jennifer Hudson) to fend for himself and for Pete after she was arrested, may lack financial resources to survive but not creativity. The movie director, via the homeless veteran character, painted a vivid picture of what ends up being the hellish life our brave veterans who had risked their lives to protect us.  More often than not, what is not said tells more than what is said.

The principal merit of director Anthony Mackie is to have used his talent to tell a depressing story in a captivating way scene after scene. The cast he had assembled is fantastic. Via Jennifer Hudson's character's rehabilitation, director Anthony also wanted to convey a message of hope in the midst of the most dire reality.",1431993600,,1358,4.895652173913043

2112206,5,B0002OXVA0,"In spite of this film being a stronger version of ""The Afterschool Special"", the film was moving.  It is strange that when people watch films of this nature, they are under the impression that the story is over-exaggerated.  Unfortunately, this particular instance of family dysfunction is all too common and it does effect a particular race.  It crashes through barriers and spans throughout every culture: leaving behind the same damage and fallout.

I was particularly taken by little Pete.  Though he knew Mister just a kid himself, he felt safer with him than he did with his own parent.

Though emotionally draining, this film dares to tell the struggles of everyday people living from day to day.  Very good film.  I highly recommend it.  Parental guidance is highly suggested as it has an R rating....but mostly due to language and drug use.",1427587200,,849,4.922535211267606

2112275,4,B0002OXVA0,"This movie is depressing to say the least. However, it was a realistic look at the hardships that some children and teens  face in the inner city.  I felt for Mistet and Pete and just wanted all the misery to end for the two. It just seem like every person around the two boys lack a moral compass. Even Alice played by Jordan Sparks who seemed like she wanted to be savior but in the end she look out for self. I guess she wanted to do a little good here and there to balance out her unsavory life. The acting is good but the ending will not let me give this four stars. (Spoilers) I find it hard to believe  that all is well now that Mister 's mother pop back in his life toward the end.  Going through a dramatic summer like that would leave some mental scars. Also I doubt a kid would be able to forgive his mom for leaving him alone for two months. I felt there should  have been some follow up on Pete and what happen to him and Alice. I wish for a better ending for Peter but I know it doesn't always  work like that. Last thing is I didn't under the relationship between Mister and Alice. She mention he was nice to her but the age gap seemed to far for close friends. I also would have like to know how Alice got her ""come up"" out the hood. It seem like her ticket out was becoming a mistress at a young age to an older man.

When Mister catches her in the bathroom servicing a customer, he goes off on her and she slaps him back. In addition to that, he and Gloria has to watch over Pete, a plucky little Korean American boy of a crack addict who also cooks meth. Mister really doesn't want the little fella there because for one, he's always asking questions, and two, he got his own problems dealing with Gloria and everyday life. Things get further complicated when Gloria is arrested and leaves them by themselves. For the majority of the summer, those two little boys survive as best they can and probably evaded the cops further until Pete got sick and got caught. what a movie. My heart went out to those two little fellas. they get my hat any day. When the cop who was looking for them finally caught up with Mister, it was though he was a bit relieved. what a flick. worth the stars and more,",1393977600,,1262,4.2845188284518825

Rating: 1.5 out of 5.0

'The Inevitable Defeat of Mister and Pete' is a first-time screenplay by Michael Starburry. His protagonist is the 'Mister' of the title played by Skylan Brooks. The plot is rather simple: when Mister's crack-addicted mother (played by Jennifer Hudson of 'Dreamgirls' and 'American Idol' fame) disappears during one particular summer in a Brooklyn public housing project, 12 year old Mister and Pete (an eight year old abused Asian-American kid Mister's mother is supposedly taking care of for a drug addict acquaintance), must fend for themselves.

Right off the bat the premise is a bit hard to swallow. Perhaps it's happened in some rare cases, but the idea that two young kids would go unreported for an entire summer without anyone from child protective services being notified, would be a rare event. Nonetheless, 'Mister and Pete' plays out more like a 'fable' than a drama culled from real events.

Still, Starburry's narrative suffers from wandering aimlessly throughout the bulk of its second act. The whole idea is that Mister has become hardened by events and characters in his environment. He can no longer act like a normal twelve year old and falls into a shell where he doesn't allow anyone to help him. It's called 'tough guy posturing' and beginning with the overly aggressive Mister cursing his high school teacher out for giving him a failing grade in school (despite his teacher offering him a ride home in his car), we must endure (over and over again) this kid 'with an attitude', until he experiences an epiphany at the denouement.

Starburry also attributes an additional character flaw to Mister, more befitting of a young adult: the quest to 'make it big' in the entertainment business. The deluded Mister believes that if he passes an audition for a TV show based in Beverly Hills, this will solve all his problems. He even has Mister reciting a well known scene from the film 'Fargo' as his audition piece.

The aforementioned 'tough guy posturing' attributed to our protagonist is the result of a series of interactions that causes Mister to clam up emotionally. The most dramatic of these interactions occurs when he spies his prostitute mother performing a sex act on a man during a bathroom break, while the family has been having lunch.

There are additional interactions Mister has with a series of characters from the projects including a bully who at one point beats him up, a gang leader (Anthony Mackie) who gives Mister a wad of money after taking pity on him and a homeless man (Jeffrey Wright), who suddenly warms up to Mister, after the beleaguered kid shares some of his dwindling food supply with the gruff bum on the street.

Occasionally, Starburry goes in for cheap stereotypes, like the grocery store owner (was he supposed to be Arabic or Indian?) who attempts to strangle poor little Mister after the kid obnoxiously overturns a few store displays inside the man's store.

Only Jordin Sparks manages to temporarily evoke a sympathetic note as Mister's 'adult friend' who promises to help the 'home alone' kids but even she ends up mysteriously vanishing, later revealed to run off with a well-heeled white guy from the suburbs.

After resorting to stealing to put food on the table, Mister finally sees the light and runs for 'help' after poor Pete falls ill. This leads to both being discovered as neglected children and ending up in a dreaded juvenile institution (which Mister imagined initially to be some kind of torture chamber). All's well that ends well for Mister, when his mother turns up sober at the facility and reclaims him. But what about little Pete? Presumably he'll remain with the state, until his own mother gets herself together (or will she?).

Unlike most reviewers, I did not find Mr. Brooks' performance as the hardened 'Mister', to be at all enjoyable. But whose fault is that? Clearly Mr. Starburry's, as the first time screenwriter boxed himself into a corner by making 'Mister' into a thoroughly obnoxious character throughout. Yes we did get the point that Mister was a victim of his environment, but still, wasn't there a way to make him a little more charming? Even kids who have been ""damaged"" by their tough upbringing have their likeable sides.  Kudos to Mr. Starburry for pointing out how tough growing up in the projects can be--but his main character simply needed a few more shades of gray!",1393200000,2,4446,4.905459387483355
2112384,5,B0002OXVA0,"The Inevitable Defeat of Mister & Pete was a pleasant surprise. I am not sure what I was expecting, but it wasn't this little gem of a movie. I know people have compared it to the movie ""Precious"" (which I never saw, but read the book ""Push""), and if that was any indication, I wasn't looking forward to it. I was one of those rare people who didn't enjoy Sapphire's book of the abused and tortured young girl, Precious. It was a little too depressing for me. Anyway, the story of ""Mister & Pete"" was just the opposite...in the end, you have hope. Your spirits soar and you rejoice and think, if two young kids can survive and make it an entire summer on their own, overcoming the challenges of living in a Brooklyn Housing Project and avoiding Child Services, alone.....then they will survive anything.

Mister (yes, that is what his mom named him), a 13-year-old boy is dealing with issues that someone his age shouldn't even know about. He lives in public housing. His mother (who doesn't mind shooting up in front of him) is a drug addicted prostitute. She's even willing to perform a sexual act in a restaurant to pay for dinner. He's failed school and told he will have to repeat his 8th grade year. So what can add to this chaos of his young life....the responsibility and addition of a small 9-year-old named Pete (whose mother is abusive but he believes is a chemist...while in actuality she is an addict, she's cooking meth). As the two scramble for food, avoid the local drug dealers and thieves, and survive for several months on their own, they learn to also dream and have hope.

I expected Jennifer Hudson to be decent in the role of his screwed up mother Gloria, which she was, but what I didn't expect was the talent of Skylan Brooks, who played Mister. While he is one of the main characters, I did not expect him to bring the character of Mister to life in such startling detail. He simply captivated the audience like none of the others in the movie did. He's definitely a star on the rise.",1392940800,16,2010,4.4890710382513666
2112385,4,B0002OXVA0,"You cannot watch this film and not be moved by the daily struggle to survive in the Brooklyn housing projects. Mister and Pete are the children of drug addicted prostitutes, caught in the web of lies and disappointments and degradation that surrounds them. Mister has just flunked the 8th grade, but has a dream of escaping the projects and going to Beverly Hills to audition for acting parts. He takes the fragile younger boy Pete under his wing to help him get through the summer. Both of their mothers are out of the picture, in jail or gone missing. The food runs out, the electricity is turned off, and they're both evading the cops who will pick them up and take them to the dreaded Riverview juvenile care facility if they find out that their parents have abandoned them. The boys form a wonderful trusting and affectionate bond in a world when there are few people that can be relied upon. I watched the out-takes, and think that the director made a mistake in cutting some of these scenes, since they add considerably to the story-telling. Though the overall tone of the movie is rather depressing, there are enough uplifting moments of humanity and hope to keep you tuned in and rooting for Mister and Pete.",1392940800,3,1217,4.638888888888889
2112386,5,B0002OXVA0,"This was a excellent movie. It was sad for Mister and Pete but, they were survials .

2112387,5,B0002OXVA0,"Mister & Pete is a beautifully constructed, thoughtful, insightful, moving, heart wrenching and ultimately incredibly satisfying film.  The performances all around, from the two young actors who play Mister & Pete, to Jennifer Hudson who is almost unrecognizable here, to Jeffrey Wright and Anthony Mackie... all are top notch.  I think what I loved most is that the film focuses on issues which we normally only read about but never get to see depicted in a contemporary surrounding. Mister & Pete is about kids down the road from all of us who need our help.  Michelle Obama called this film one of her favorites of the year and I can understand why.  There are Mister & Pete's everywhere in this country and yet we close our eyes to them and their conditions.  This film opens our eyes and allows us to see that everyone needs help and human interaction.",1392681600,2,857,4.724832214765101
2112388,4,B0002OXVA0,"THE INEVITABLE DEFEAT of MISTER & PETE (""IDMP"") is not quite as fully realized a story as 2009's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Precious/dp/B0037QM8YA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Precious</a>, but it has much the same atmosphere and shares the gritty down-and-out NYC setting. In other respects, it's a VERY different sort of film. Often stark, frequently amusing, IDMP goes in many unexpected directions.

Partly by necessity, it's rather slow-moving, with regular bits of heavy suspense here and there. 60-70% (perhaps a bit too much) of it is confined to the abandoned apartment where the two young boys hide after Mister's mother is arrested. Though far from boring, with a number of turnabouts, IDMP may not fully satisfy those who are expecting more of an urban odyssey.

Skylan Brooks (14-year-old Mister) and Ethan Dizon (Pete, about six years younger) are naturals in their roles, and Brooks does a particularly outstanding job of acting-within-acting. Anthony Mackie also gives a laudable performance as Kris the pimp/drug dealer. Yet, the characters of Mister and Pete are hard to buy in certain respects. Mister seems a bit TOO noble and crafty for a young boy from his background who's failing eighth grade and usually just screams ""F__ you!"" and runs off when he gets frustrated. Having said that, I think the point is that having Pete, who's been even more neglected than Mister himself, as a surrogate little brother and ally against the oppressive adult world brings out the true potential in Mister, who also discovers the useful and liberating qualities of acting and role-playing in life's struggles. Pete also seems a bit too polite and well-spoken considering his age and background, but again, something would be lost if he were otherwise. One way or another, IDMP is a very rich multi-character study of different people in squalid circumstances. It also shows the ethnically diverse atmosphere of Brooklyn without falling to the stereotypes we often get in this type of setting.",1392595200,,2046,5.430817610062893

The hood is many things and for these kids it's ultimately a place of survival and hope.",1391644800,2,418,4.573333333333333
2112391,4,B0002OXVA0,"""Is it OK not to love your mom?"" Mister (Brooks) is having a tough time at school not only fitting in but with his grades as well. When he leaves the only place he has to go is home, to his drug addicted and basically absent mother Gloria (Hudson). One day he comes home to find Pete, a kid he knows in his room. Gloria informs Mister they will be taking care of him for a few days but no one sees what is coming next. First of all I have to start by saying this is a fantastic movie but hard to watch. I would compare it to Precious in that way. This one deals with how the kids take care of themselves in the only way they know how rather then living with an abusive mother. The movie is emotionally draining but very much worth seeing especially for the kid playing Mister. He was amazing in this and deserves some sort of nomination. He really brings powerful emotions to this and even when he breaks the law in some scenes you are still rooting for him. I can not say enough about this movie and it deserves to be seen by a larger audience then it will get. Overall, emotionally draining but a must see movie. I highly recommend this. I give it an A.",1388707200,33,1155,4.092511013215859
