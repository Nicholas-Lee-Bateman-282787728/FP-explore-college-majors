6266130,1,B00IJHG7EY,"This is not a balanced documentary on the presentation of the anti-gay legislation in Uganda.  It has a political agenda that intends to link Evangelicals with Conservatives, which is not true, and to link both with a political anti-gay agenda in Uganda, which again is not true of mainstream Evangelicalism or mainstream Conservatism. Scott Lively is a nutty extremist, as is Lou Engle, the founder of IHOP.  None of these guys represent the US Evangelicals, nor US Conservatives and Roger Ross Williams, the producer and director of this film, did not even attempt to document such a link, just asserting it as truth without any evidence.  To be sure, this legislation in Uganda is bad, but having been to Africa myself, the problem in Uganda stems from several sources, which Williams did not even mention.  First, African ministers have no formal seminary training and lacking that, tend to make things up, with the end result of preaching heresy.  Given that, they are easily influenced when extremists visit and espouse their heresy.  The theological views espoused by Martin Ssempa, are just as wrong and heretical as the views espoused by Kapya Kaoma, the African pastor in the US and Christopher Ssenjonjo, the Anglican Bishop in Uganda.  Both are extreme, wrong, views at the opposite end of the theological issue.  No attempt was made to relay the mainline Evangelical view of this issue and the view espoused by properly trained theologians, which is: we are all sinners, no sin greater or worse than the other, to call out someone for a particular sin while ignoring our own is wrong, and the only hope for salvation any of us have is through the saving grace offered by Jesus Christ.  There are plenty of missionaries and pastors in Africa that are teaching just that, from all countries, not just the U.S.",1393718400,8,1820,4.90228013029316

6266132,2,B00IJHG7EY,"I came into this movie with an open mind about critics of Christian evangelism. Although not an evangelical myself, I believe in respecting other people's religious ideologies, no matter how strange or foreign they might be. I support logical arguments and loathe emotional ones, even if those emotional hysterics are in support of an issue that I agree with. This documentary implies that the Western, Christian missionaries are somehow tricking Africans into adopting anti-gay positions and that evangicals are corrupt.

Although I am by no means an African scholar, it can plainly be seen that Uganda is quickly becoming a hellhole of homophobia. In the future, residents of the free world might have to levy sanctions against the African nation for human rights violations that Africans will choose to commit.

These Christians missionaries are depicted in this movie as well-meaning fools (the young) and the evangical leaders are inherently corrupt (the older ones), and they're fleecing the flock. They are sending missionaries to Africa not only because they hate gay people but because it is a money-making scheme. There is another movie here about the Christians who are essentially robbing their parishioners, living in splendor as the people are barely scrapping by. Jesus was against the moneylenders--and he never lived in anything close to opulence, nor did he present himself as someone better than his followers. Sunlight is the best disinfectant, and the televangelist movement requires constant cleaning.

 That said, the boots on the ground are clearly the believers, and the filmmakers take glee in mocking them. (Probably virgins!) The missionaries ride in SUVs as the filmmakers themselves view Africa thru a lens. They are claiming that gay sex is wrong, because it says so in the Bible. However, for anyone who has actually read the Bible, claiming that gay sex is morally acceptable would be bizarre. The Africans were the ones who have added murder to the equation; in the West, gays have been progressively granted more freedoms, owing both to the advocacy of liberalism and to religious people resigning to the changing winds. (The filmmakers have failed to find footage of American evangelists advocating murder.) The filmmakers are not attacking the murder, but the ideology, which is also offensive to anyone who respects the human right to practice one's religious ideology.

The fear of a ""Christian Taliban"" is worrisome, but it should also be noted that the actual Taliban was Islamic in nature, and nature abhors a vacuum--committed Christians will always act as a bulwark against Muslims. The implication that the Ugandans are exchanging one dictator (Idi Amin) for another (Christianity) is just plain stupid.

There is a great degree of white man's burden here, with the implication being that Africans are not smart enough to decide for themselves how to feel about homosexuality. I sincerely doubt that Uganda was a gay paradise before the arrival of Christian missionaries. It is easy to forget that homosexuality was considered a mental disease in America until the 1970s, and gay sex between consenting adults wasn't fully recognized as legal until 2003. (Lawrence v. Texas)

Ultimately the viewer of this doc should decide for themselves--just as the people of Uganda.",1405728000,7,3314,5.253308128544424
6266133,5,B00IJHG7EY,"""When the righteous rule the people rejoice."" One of many positions that make it hard to tell if that's coming from the Christian right or the Islamic right. . Filmed in Uganda are The Family Life Network, International House of Prayer, Lou Engle, Joanna Watson and Scott Lively. The later an American evangelist, Holocaust revisionist, with the position that homosexuals are recruiting your children, ""your sons and daughters"". With statements like that, these people and organizations, voiced support for imprisoning gays in Uganda (and most likely the US) as a step toward protecting society. Also relegated to their ""hated"" list was the UN & UNICEF because of their efforts to moderate overpopulation, disease & hunger through supporting condom use.
When I listened to these apostles of hate, ""The reward of sin is death, the Bible says."" I was struck by an unsettling erratic, emotional frenzy and absence of language suggesting any reasoned thought - just an indoctrinated, brainwashed from childhood, robotic memorized recitation of biblical passages.
Shown in the film, and well known, is how these religious corporations rationalize the extreme wealth that they generate as exemplified by IHOP's top evangelists and others having mansions (in some cases more than one).
I JUST CAN'T SEE JESUS IN A MANSION! Yes, the rationale is that God has personally Ok'ed it, as revealed by those who benefit.

I was also struck by how little respect there is for cultural diversity and history. Similar to the Christian retelling of American history with the near extinction of the ""savages"" and the Christianization of their culture because God (as conveyed by the white Europeans standing to benefit) branded them as savage. A similar edict of conversion is seen with a missionary zeal in Uganda, made even more effective, just as it was for the Native peoples of the Americas, in them being awe-struck by the god like material power of the white ""helpers"". Most effective in extolling that, ""My God is superior to your god.""

Through out the film the position of power is symbolized by being above and putting hands on a submissive person - ""we know better than you, what's good for you"", followed then by promises of ""eternal life"". The taking of poorly educated and barely surviving people by providing food and needed medical care with the ultimate intent of conversion is deceptive and dishonest.",1403395200,3,2400,5.104325699745547

I also, of course, am aware of current issues in the United States about same sex marriage.

I accepted the kind offer of First Run Features, the distributor of Roger Ross Williams' praised documentary, ""God Loves Uganda"" to send me a review copy to pursue my interest, discussed above, and to learn more about Africa. The film is provocative and well-made, but it left me uneasy and dissatisfied. The movie has an important message, but it is filled with its own polemic.

The film centers upon Uganda's Anti-Gay legislation signed into law in February, 2014 which carries harsh penalties for the commission of homosexual offenses. The focus on the film in on the role of American fundamentalist evangelical organizations, particularly the International House of Prayer (IHOP) for their missionary activities in Uganda. The missionaries are shown as well-funded by their American supporters.  While the film states that the missionaries do some good work in education and taking care of orphans, for example, and are frequently, at least at the individual level, well-meaning, it concentrates on their position on sexual morality. They are shown as stridently anti-gay.  The film works to connect the activities of the Uganda government in enacting harsh anti-gay legislation with the work of the American fundamentalists. The film suggests, undoubtedly correctly, that gay people are subject to the threat of severe violence in Uganda. The film might be directed to Uganda, to secure change in the legislation, or to viewers in the United States and elsewhere to urge them to stop supporting the missionary activities in Uganda, if they are doing so, or to oppose actively such activities. The film also might be directed to the missionaries themselves so that they may change what the film sees as their activities in Uganda.  The film sees missionary activities in Uganda as resulting from a culture war about homosexuality in the United States which the fundamentalists have lost. They have moved on to spread their teachings of hate, as portrayed in the film, to Africa.

Neither the missionaries nor Uganda society, which was over 85 percent Christian before the arrival of the IHOP missionaries are portrayed well, on the whole. The film does portray positively a number of articulate clerics from Uganda who speak out forcefully about the anti-gay legislation and anti-gay teachings among the evangelicals.  The film mentions but does not emphasize that over thirty countries in sub-Saharan Africa have statutes on the books which in some fashion or other prohibit homosexuality. These statutes pre-date the recent legislation in Uganda. It would be difficult to blame these pre-existing statutes on current anti-gay preaching by American fundamentalist missionaries. It is valuable to remember that many countries outside Africa still have laws prohibiting at least some homosexual activity and that the United States had such statutes until relatively recently. One needs to be skeptical of absolutes of almost any kind.

There is a backhanded colonialism to this movie. In other words, the film seems to assume that the people of Uganda are overly inclined to believe Christian preachers from the United States when the views of these preachers are largely rejected and perhaps now unwelcome in this country. The film to me showed skepticism about the ability of Uganda to govern itself and to exercise an informed judgment on sexuality and legislation.  It seems to show them as backward as compared to the standard held up by the film in areas of sexuality. It seems to take the position that the current way this issue is progressing in the United States has a form of universal cross-cultural, cross-religious validity.

Similarly, as some critics have pointed out, the film preaches tolerance while showing a substantial lack of this difficult virtue. If IHOP and its allies represent the losing side in an American culture war, the makers of the film represent the victors. It is one thing to point out and to deplore violence against homosexual people and others.  It may be something else to claim that the position of the filmmakers is the only way to God, a position that has as little to commend it as understanding the Deity as the way of the fundamentalists. With the apparent strong change of American opinion and jurisprudence in favor of same sex marriage, it is important to remember that other nations are entitled to find their own path. Their may be other courses possible between that of the contemporary United States, on the one hand, and violence, beatings, and criminalization, on the other hand.

In the United States, same sex marriage is a civil not necessarily a religious right. Religious beliefs enjoy First Amendment protection although in the case of same sex marriage the distinction is becoming blurred. In the United States and presumably in Uganda, religions may adopt their own position on homosexuality if they wish. I would not be overly harsh or overly supportive of clergy of one denomination or the other in this country or in any other.  God speaks maybe in different ways without supporting beatings or violence.

These are some of my thoughts on ""God Loves Uganda"". I still need to learn more about Africa. The film helps me understand how little I know.

6266137,1,B00IJHG7EY,"A simple viewing of the film leads any uninformed viewer to think that the International House of Prayer sends a lot of money and missionaries to Uganda and that they are a significant force for political change in the nation. IHOPKC is now apparently sending missionaries out to this and other African nations to help win the culture war there as the culture war is lost in the US. One academic review of the film states the International House of Prayer have been training and sending missionaries to Uganda for many years, viewing it  as a place full of possible converts to be won for Christ. Their efforts have been rewarded by the conversion of many Ugandans. The truth is that the crew from God Loves Uganda followed the first and only missions trip from the IHOPKC Missions School to Uganda. This was not just the first missions trip to this nation, it was actually the first group of students from the school period, the Missions School only beginning during the making of the film. We have not sent or supported other missionaries in Uganda before or since (and actually didn't support this group  my own travel expenses for the trip were actually funded by the filmmakers) we have no indigenous presence. Although Joanna Watson did attend a 3 month internship at IHOPKC in 2009, she was not sent from IHOPKC, is not financially supported by IHOPKC, and is not even known by the majority of IHOPKC leadership. Likewise while Jesse and Rachelle Digges did attend the bible school for a year in 2001 and are friends of many at IHOPKC, they are in no way organizationally or financially connected to IHOPKC. As we have no representation in Uganda, it would make it rather difficult to have been successful in converting many Ugandans.

A simple viewing of the film leads viewers to think that all that missionaries are preaching is Christian sexual ethics and the need for locals to abide by such ethics or be damned, also that the ideas and the money sent are to support this end. Due to the nature of the films message this would have to be the case, if this were not true the films main premise would be entirely weakened. Although the stated purposes of the film may have been to investigate the impulses and work of missionaries, the film is clearly aimed at exploring a more narrow purview; the views of sexual morality as it relates to missionaries.  Several news outlets have taken this as the message of the film claiming that the missions teams from IHOPKC spend time spreading anti-gay rhetoric in Uganda. This is I would contend far from the truth. The only team that visited in 2011 spent time in prayer, in humanitarian work and in evangelism. This evangelism never included any kind of hate speech against gays or for that matter any speech about sexuality. It did however focus on calling people into a relationship with Jesus Christ. The core of this gospel message is not a call to change someones behaviour; it is perhaps more offensive, it is a call to surrender our old identity, whether that is based upon what we do, such as our job or our family or even our sexuality and have Christ replace that with a new identity based upon who Christ is and what he has done. We believe Christ calls all to surrender the old identity and accept the new identity in Christ. We do believe that if a person accepts the grace of Jesus and becomes a disciple of Jesus it will by necessity bring about lifestyle changes, an individuals entire approach to life, to work, to relationships and even to sexual union will change. This transforming, redeeming work is something the scripture calls salvation or being born-again.

 While I cannot speak for the entire Christian or even the evangelical world. Evangelism (Christians speaking to those who don't know about the offer of a new life in Christ) should never be demonizing and for that matter is never concerned with changing the worlds sexual morality. I am certain this is true of all Christians I know. The process of discipleship in the Christian church however is a different matter, Christians according to  New Testament writings are to call each other to sexual purity. For those outside the church we are told by Paul to not spend any time concerned with their morality, as who he said in his letter to the church in Corinth concerning sexual immorality For what have I to do with judging outsiders? Is it not those inside the church whom you are to judge? Meaning he would not pass any judgment on unbelievers, but did seek sexual purity amongst the believers. This would be true of IHOPKC and many bible believing Christians.

I disagree strongly with many of the provisions of the 2009 Anti-Homosexuality Bill and have written as such in other blog posts and even stated my opposition in the times I was interviewed for God Loves Uganda. I do believe if enacted it could bring about  victimization, a culture of fear and suspicion and even death. I am also firmly opposed to any violence or victimization against any sector of society. I firmly disagree with many of the disturbing actions of certain individuals in Uganda who promote and fuel such victimization (I think particularly of the actions of the Rolling Stone Magazine). I would also agree that sometimes the language that we as evangelicals employ is in need of refinement, words have power and would advocate changes in some sloppy language (especially as it relates to the seven mountains/spheres of influence) to reflect this. However I do not agree that the message of the Gospel of Jesus and of the majority of evangelicals, including the young missionaries from IHOPKC leads to an ideology of hate within any culture. Indeed I would contend the very language of Human Rights comes from within the Christian community. 1

 I would also agree with the Variety magazine summation of the film that while the film outwardly endorses (a message of toleration) it doesnt entirely embody, as far as evangelicals are concerned . The film is trying to provoke dialogue, but there is no dialogue in the film between the main detractor  Kaoma and the main protagonist  IHOPKC. Kaomas statements are taken at face value and as such targets IHOPKC as its victim.

Conclusion

The bottom line is that IHOPKC is opposed to violence and victimization of any sector of society (wherever that society may be) and are opposed to ideology that feeds violence and victimization. This must be said first, foremost and loudest. However I do not feel as a Christian believer that believing in the sexual ethic laid out in the Bible and the corresponding belief in the authority of scripture as understood for thousands of years leads to such views. I was finally persuaded to be involved in this project as I was told it would not pursue the same polarizing view of liberals opposed to evangelicals. I wanted to demonstrate to Roger and the crew friendship even in a limited way and that we as believers are not the caricature so often portrayed in the media of the imperialist, bigoted religious right. I was clearly not successful as it relates to the film portrayal. I hope that the friendship I extended is still welcomed, and I will in some way be successful in extending the love of Christ outside the film rather than in it. I bear no ill will towards any of the film makers or indeed any of those writers who have reviewed the film have extended extreme vitriol towards our actions as portrayed in the film. I pray that we will all walk a little closer to the light as we carry on our journey.

In this case, the ""cloud of evil"" is not some disembodied force, but conservative American Evangelicals who see Uganda as the next place to take the culture war, since their message is losing ground in the United States.  And just as Hitler and the Nazi Party built their power base on the demonization of Jews, several Ugandan politicians and religious leaders are building their own power on gay hatred.  The footage of marchers with anti-gay signs, shouting slogans, was chilling in its similarity to  demonstrations in Germany in the 1930s.  The Nazis were big supporters of the ""family"" and ""purity,"" too, and saw themselves as the vanguard of a new world with the ""right"" values.

Fortunately, Uganda does not have the same military aspirations that the Nazis did, but it is disheartening to see people who have been so victimized by colonialism and globalization, turn their rage onto a helpless minority within their own country.  Hopefully this tide of hatred has crested with the defeat, at least for the moment, of the anti-gay bill, and with Scott Lively about to stand trial for crimes against humanity.

I have revised my review to three stars based on learning that the portrayal of IHOP-KC in this film is inaccurate.  IHOP-KC claims to not be involved in preaching ""sexual morality"" in Uganda, and in fact, states that they have not sent any missionaries there other than the group shown in this film.  IHOP-KC also states that they are opposed to the anti-gay bill under discussion.

8642576,5,B00IJHG7EY,"The so-called ""culture wars"" are rapidly being lost by the conservative right in the United States, thanks to the rapid advance of same-sex marriage and some pesky concepts such as ""Separation of Church and State"" and the US Constitution.  Undaunted by these setbacks, many in the mega-churches are turning their attention outward to the developing world, in particular to Africa.  It is there that right-wing conservative Christians hope to equal the playing field and repel the onslaught of homosexuality, which they view as an abomination before God.

In Uganda, the eventual overthrow of Idi Amin has left a void that American evangelists view as a unique opportunity.  This is the focus of the fascinating documentary, God Loves Uganda.

The country of Uganda is overwhelmingly Christian.  The International House of Prayer (IHOP), a cult-like megachurch based in Kansas City, MO, has been actively sending hundreds of wide-eyed young white missionaries to Uganda to spread the word of Jesus' love.  Armed with millions of dollars in donated funds, IHOP Ministries has been building schools, churches and pouring much needed assistance into the Uganda culture.  Nice of them, I suppose, but for many American Christian fundamentalists, it's more about politics than preaching.  Although he is loath to admit it, IHOP's charismatic manager, Lou Engle, clearly delights in finally gaining the upper hand in his battle against the gays, in Uganda if not in his home country.  As a direct result of the ""success"" that IHOP has enjoyed in Uganda, American evangelist Scott Lively was allowed to address Uganda's Parliament for six hours, spreading lies, misinformation, half-truths and hatred against Uganda's LGBT populace.  Shortly after his visit, and urged by Uganda-born preacher and liar Martin Ssempa, Uganda passed their Anti-Homosexuality Act in 2014, whereby LGBT people can be penalized with life in prison for certain gay sex acts, ""spreading propaganda"" and just for daring to be who they are openly.  Ssempa is known to international activist as the ""eat da poo-poo"" minister, for his highly watchable speech wherein he spreads as much misinformation about gay people as practically anyone, America's Pat Roberson notwithstanding.

Inspired by the severity of this law, mobs of Ugandan ""Christians"" have been known to drag effeminate gay men from their homes and beat them to death.  A tabloid newspaper there printed the names and home addresses of the ""Top 100 Homos"" and, as a direct result, a prominent activist was bludgeoned to death by an ""unknown assailant"".  It should be noted that the law does not include a death penalty only because of international pressure to drop that provision.

Fortunately, there are some Ugandan clergymen who have been fighting the madness.  But they are few and far between.  One of the most outspoken was forced to flee Uganda in fear for his life.

There are those who will insist that this documentary is skewered to a ""pro-gay agenda"", but I say that hidden cameras and recording tape do not lie.  There is more than sufficient documentation proffered by this film to convince anyone that Uganda's Anti-Homosexuality Act is evil, bigoted and a source of much anxiety and discrimination to that country's LGBT community, as well as plenty to suggest that the influences of American evangelists are at least partly if not fully to blame.  Already similar laws are being proposed in other African Nations where Christianity is the primary religion.  Hopefully international outrage and pressure from human rights groups will be sufficient in turning the tide against the religious zealots, but only time will tell.",1417305600,5,3668,5.234188034188034
8642577,5,B00IJHG7EY,Excellent documentary and yet 'horrific' when it comes to the violation of human rights. The religious-right wing evangelicals have no RIGHT to convince any other culture that their way is the RIGHT way!,1414454400,3,203,5.181818181818182
8642578,4,B00IJHG7EY,"This film is focused primarily upon the preaching of missionaries and passage of the 2014 Uganda law which can punish gay people with life in prison. I'm an atheist transgender woman, married to another woman, and I sponsor a child in Uganda through a catholic charity, so the issues this film addresses are very important to me. Because of the present laws, I am unable to see my little girl.

So I appreciate the spotlight the movie puts on this important issue. However, the film is light on facts, and narrowly focused. Little is said about how much money evangelicals provide Uganda (I don't know myself). Moreover, the film fails to provide a larger context for Uganda's overall situation. Uganda is one of the poorest countries in the world with an extremely corrupt government, which dramatically restricts what NGOs can do in the area. Violent suppression of dissent is common. Torture is rampant.

Focusing primarily on U.S. missionaries without looking at the backdrop they are acting in, therefore, seems to a picture that is very lacking in perspective. I don't think the solution to homophobia in Uganda lies in condemning the religious right in this nation. Rather, an examination of the context in which the right operates  would be more likely to generate change.

Notably, the documentary does not have a single message of something the viewers can do to help if they choose. The film provides no contrary vision of relief efforts from the West that could help Uganda's LBGT community.

I still give it four stars though because I'm happy with any film that at least shines a bit of a spotlight on what is going on in Uganda.",1411084800,9,1643,4.832740213523132
