8216737,5,B000V6LT9O,"Due to how some of the film has been obtained, parts of it are not as clear as one would want it.  The German narration is typical war time progaganda, as is expected, nevertheless it is still interesting.  The film itself is great from an historical perspective, all real, and facinating.  The Russia-German war film is what most Americans have never seen and is specially interesting.  If one is interested at all in the European WWII scene, these films are a must see.",1257552000,,471,4.63855421686747
