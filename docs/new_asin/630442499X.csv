7871000,4,630442499X,"Hello Amazon,

The movie is as I expected.  I love the movie and the quality is about as good as the original taping and video images can get - under the circumstances - I suppose; only, I wish it were available in DVD format (which is why I entitled my review: ""As I Would Like It"".  That is by no means a slap in the face but only a tongue-in-cheek).  I am truly thankful to have my coveted movie (which I was unable to find elsewhere - in either video or DVD) but can you (or anyone else) tell me if it is availabe in DVD format anywhere?

Thanks...and that is my reply folks!",1256083200,,579,4.043859649122807
7871001,5,630442499X,"At 158 minutes, this production is a full hour longer than the 1936 Olivier version and a half-hour longer than the 2007 Kenneth Branagh production. This extra running time is used to good advantage in presenting the most complete film version of this play. While less ""cinematic"" than Branagh's production it avoids looking too ""stagey"" through the judicial use of different camera angles and close-ups. Nicholas Pennell is especially good as Jacques.",1196899200,,452,5.291666666666667
7871002,5,630442499X,"The actors could have been more closely miked, the editing could have included more close-ups, the actors' faces could have been more brightly illuminated.  But this is a surprisingly effective, satisfying filming of Shakespeare's supreme comedy and heroine.  The performance is first-rate and the reproduction good enough (I wasn't even aware the tape was recorded in EP mode) to capture both the letter and spirit of the play as well as the response of an ""informed,"" appreciative audience.  The presentation brings to life Shakespeare's language in a manner that encourages the spectator to complete the meanings through the work of the imagination, as opposed to the ""pre-formed"" meanings of a lavish Branagh cinematic event, in which language necessarily takes the role of mere accompanist.
The pastoral, philosophical nature of this play in particular makes it difficult going for many readers, especially if they haven't cut their teeth first on less demanding comedies--12th Night, Midsummer Night's Dream, Much Ado.  For this reason, the presence of coarse characters and vulgar sexual jokes is both a necessary dramatic device and counterbalance to the ethereal fancies of the ""enchanted"" lovers.  But in the middle of all the extremes is Rosalind--a boy actor playing a woman who plays a man playing a woman--with insights about gender, love and marriage that take us beyond the most probing modern discussions of those subjects.  As preparation for this play, the reader would be well advised to try Shakespeare's Sonnet 20, which dismisses biological differences between the sexes and affirms the power of love to at once affirm and transcend male-female difference.  Was Shakespeare homosexual?  Irrelevant. ( ""Homosexual"" and ""heterosexual"" weren't in Shakespeare's lexicon.)  Are the poems and plays homoerotic?  Yes, frequently.  But more importantly they constantly force us to examine the limitations of our own assumptions and linguistic categories concerning human sexuality.
""As You Like It"" is above all a story about education.  To the blindesses, fevers, madness of  lovers gone wrong, Rosalind serves as teacher, physician, counselor--and yet is a student as well, bringing us closer to the meanings of love even as she is discovering them for herself.",984096000,38,2278,5.4375
7871003,3,630442499X,"Sometimes bizarre rendition of Shakespeare's comedy with a very young Laurence Olivier. The forest scenes are the best with very wild animals tramping across the camera eye as if they just escaped from a zoo. The film is old, creaky and sometimes inaudible but that is part of it's charm. Elizabeth Bergner's closing bit in the epilogue is very lovely.",983664000,,352,4.883333333333334
7871004,5,630442499X,"This rendition of the popular comedy is not a glitzy Hollywood production, and in fact much of its charm derives from the fact that it is a live stage production that was ""movified"" by video cameras in the theater.
Although movie creations can offer intimacy and rich scenery that is not  available on stage, there are always speeches that are whispered and  shouted, and some of the throw-away lines are swallowed so that it can be  difficult to understand the words-which is very important to the  appreciation of the philosophical richness of Shakespeare's comedies.  The  twin benefits I see is this Stratford Festival production are that (1) it  is much easier to understand all of the words, because stage players have  to speak all lines to the guy in the back row.  And (2) the stage and  scenery are more like the Elizabethan theaters the plays were written to be  performed in.  You don't need fancy scenery to enjoy a Shakespeare play;  you need excellent actors and a lively imagination.
 All of the important  actors are extremely well-cast, but Roberta Maxwell outshines them all.  She brings Rosalind to life in a fresh and captivating interpretation.  Truly she ""counterfeits well"" in her male impersonator's role,  but throughout she is feminine grace personified.  I fell in love with her  by the end of the second scene, as would any red-blooded male who is free  to do so. Her hands are especially beautiful in her eloquent gestures.
Of  course, Orlando is as charming to the ladies, but his role is almost  eclipsed by the brilliant Roberta.
The words of the play are true to the  text, but the barnyard humor is surprisingly overplayed for the taste of  educated people; however, mature observers can discount these occurrences  for the richness of the morality and the philosophical expression offered  by the Shakespearean wit.  He puts most of the best lines into the mouths  of rustics and fools, which makes them the more notable.
This video is  an excellent buy!",946425600,56,1990,4.87125748502994
7871005,5,630442499X,"I was overjoyed to find it available on videotape through amazon.com.
  This is a wonderful, magical performance, from top to bottom.  The late Nicholas Pennell and Rosemay Dunsmore especially stand  out as Jacques and Celia -- and watch their reactions to other characters,  when their characters don't have lines.
  The music is outstanding.  The  staging, especially the dark opening, is superb.  More than 15 years later,  this is still a favorite that I could watch again and again.",942710400,20,487,5.115384615384615
7871006,3,630442499X,"Paul Czinner's version of Shakespeare's 'As You Like It' was one of the first Shakespearean films ever.  For this fact alone it is often heralded.  Aside from this virtue, the film's treatment of character is  thought-provoking and innovative.  Olivier, a callow youth, is a powerful  Orlando, but Bergner (Paul Czinner's wife) is a little too playful - a  little too much like Robin Hood in the forest. The most interesting feature  of the film is the recreation of a forest in a studio.  The forest covered  acres of space, and looks very artificial. This may seem strange, until one  remembers that Shakespeare's forest is also an artificial construct  intended as a place as much of the mind as of physical location. The film's  closing epilogue has Rosalind metamorphosing from Ganymede - her character  in disguise - to Rosalind.  This use of trick-photography is fascinating  and unique.  The addition of a real lioness and snake also adds an air of  verisimilitude, which is thrilling. This film is too readily overlooked,  and should be considered and appreciated. See this film, but look out for  Christine Edzard's 1992 film version of the play, set in an urban  wasteland.",913852800,,1184,4.9743589743589745
