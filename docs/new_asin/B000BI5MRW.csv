8086912,1,B000BI5MRW,This DVD is not really what we were looking for. My daughter doesn't like it at all. I wish the description gave u all the songs on it. And if didn't. I took a chance ANC never will again,1357084800,,187,3.8205128205128207
8086913,1,B000BI5MRW,"Bought it anyway. Regret it. Poorly made. Terrible editing. Terrible purchase. Even if your kid is into it, this will not be worth it!",1355356800,,134,4.625
8086914,1,B000BI5MRW,"Waste of money! Ok, the video is well produced and the singing is safe for kids. It is also fun to watch, entertaining and well performed. My issue is that, in our modern world, my grandkids found (after purchase) that there is a Kidz Bop channel on our cable and probably on Internet also. Unless you still live in the old non-tech world or you have a specific need that cable or Internet access won't fill, money spent on these videos is a waste.",1345161600,,448,4.345238095238095
8086915,3,B000BI5MRW,"I got this from the library for my kids to watch. They loved it! It is not well made, but they just loved singing along. The Kidz Bop kids lip sync and do a poor job of it, but my kids didn't seem to care. It has a high amusement factor if you choose to watch with your kids. I was laughing so hard that I had to turn away so as not to offend my kids. I always appreciate humor in kid's programs since they tend to watch their favorites over and over....and over.....again!",1207699200,,473,3.9894736842105263
8086916,5,B000BI5MRW,"My kids love this DVD, these are songs they already know and hear on the radio, but with 'kid-friendly' music videos to go along with them....I think it is perfect for families who love music!!",1187654400,2,193,4.542857142857143
8086917,4,B000BI5MRW,"My children, 2 (boy) and 4 (girl), both like this dvd.  We found that they REALLY liked the Laurie Berkner music DVD and have scoured around for anything similar.  There isn't much to be found unfortunately- which makes this hard to rate as there isn't much to compare it to.  It's not as big of a hit as the Berkner DVD, but it still gets a lot of play.  The videos are visually appealing and the style varies enough to keep them interested in the action as well as the music.",1170547200,,477,4.208791208791209
8086918,1,B000BI5MRW,"THis is one of the worst scams I have ever been exposed to. This video plus shipping and handling cost me about $15, but I would maybe buy it for $1. It is such a short video clip and the music is so slow (or just not fun) that my kid lost interest within the first few moments.

DO NOT BUY THIS! It is the biggest waste of money ever!",1141603200,15,335,3.7857142857142856
