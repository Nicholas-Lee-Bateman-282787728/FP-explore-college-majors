5320082,5,B009DHFJVQ,"I loved every minute of this very clever gang !!!!!! The best I have seen over the years.....the whole collection was well worth the $purchase price.  To try to describe the stories would only spoil the magic... part of the magic is in the actors and their acting/presentation of each of their part of the ""Hustle""... well worth having.!!!!",1409616000,,340,4.762711864406779
5320083,5,B009DHFJVQ,"I love the series Hustle - unfortunately, this was not available for US televisions - wrong zone!  We would have had to buy a convertor in order to play these DVD,s.  Hopefully the UK will provide us with this series in US format.",1404259200,,230,4.325581395348837
5320084,5,B009DHFJVQ,"This series is very entertaining!  The cast is fantastic, the writing is cleaver and the acting is great!  I starting watching this series on Hulu Plus and I was hooked after watching a few episodes.  One thing to note, even though this series is available to watch on Hulu Plus, they have been edited and are missing scenes.  The DVD's are great because they are complete episodes and of course they have special features.  Another thing to note is that these DVD's are coded for Region 2 (UK) so unless you have a region free DVD or Blu-Ray player, you won't be able to view these DVD's.",1401408000,,589,4.4672897196261685
5320085,5,B009DHFJVQ,"I found this is to be an entertaining series about a group of con-artists with an ensemble cast of likable and engaging characters. The stories remain fresh by increasing the complexity of the cons as the audience becomes familiar with plot twists. Unfortunately only the first 4 seasons are available in the Region-1 U.S. DVD format. I have both the U.S. (seasons 1-4) and the British (seasons 1-8) packages and they only differ slightly in the menu graphics.

As Amazon states, the complete series of all 8 seasons is only available in the non-US European format that is used in Britain. To play these on a standard U.S. NTSC/ATSC TV, an All-Region (Region-Free), Multisystem (NTSC/PAL) DVD player is required. The Panasonic Model DVD-S48GA-K will do this quite well and is available from a reputable U.S. supplier, B&H Photo of New York, for about $90 including shipping. Note that this is a genuine Panasonic international factory model, and not an aftermarket unit modified with 3rd-party firmware. Also be aware that there are various other Panasonic models available in the DVD-S48 series, which may not function as this one does. Although it is marked on the rear panel as a ""Region-3"" player, I have tested it successfully with Region-1 and Region-2 disks and it appears to be an ""All Region"" disc player. It also played a number of burned DVD discs with various menu systems that had problems playing on a number of Sony, Toshiba, and Blu-ray players that I have. Note that it provides 2 analog video outputs only (no HDMI): Composite video (the Yellow RCA jack) and Component video (the Red, Blue, & Green jack) - and your TV MUST have at least one of these inputs. On my Sony TV, the Component video displayed an excellent picture with a deep black level and sharp detail at standard definition (480i) resolution. Also, the Stereo L/R analog audio output sounded excellent through my full-range sound system. Therefore technically, these discs are produced in full studio-quality at standard definition.",1378684800,18,2015,4.9792284866468846
5320086,5,B009DHFJVQ,"Great shows! Each character is with genuine characteristic and skill, well written plot, and .... just can't love Mickey and Emma more!",1373760000,,135,5.181818181818182
5320087,5,B009DHFJVQ,"Another great series from the UK.  Very well acted, great twists in most shows.  Adrian Lester and Robert Glennister are terrific. The latter seasons are Co-produced with A&E and flow a bit better. Overall if you enjoy movies like The Italian Job and Ocean's Eleven; you will enjoy this series.",1366761600,,294,4.86
8540290,4,B009DHFJVQ,"A bit fantastic at times, but fun and exciting always.  If you can suspend your disbelief and enjoy the fun, I would recommend this series.

I went out of my way to buy a Region-Free DVD player just so that I could get this series.  I'm sure I'll enjoy other non-Canadian region DVD's in the future but this is the series that made up my mind to make the purchase and I don't regret it.",1496448000,,386,4.12
8540291,5,B009DHFJVQ,"Wonderful show! Had its casting ups and downs, but consistently well-written, even if they did borrow from The Sting a few too many times. PAL DVDs are better quality than the NTSC discs produced of Seasons 1-4 for US players.",1482278400,,226,4.675

8540297,4,B009DHFJVQ,"Excellent series. But to not have it available for all regions, makes no sense (especially since it debuted on AMC, an American cable station). I am glad that Amazon is now posting warnings in clear labels; I've had friends that bought some of the later series only to find they couldn't play them. I'm hoping these will all get re-released soon, in regional format where I can purchase and view them. In the meantime, I recommend the first 4 seasons (series) because they really are an example of great quality acting and writing.",1434931200,3,531,4.720430107526882

8540299,5,B009DHFJVQ,"I love the show Hustle, and have seasons 1 - 4 in my video library, but I want to #%@&^*# when season 5 to 8 are going to be put on U.S. video so I can own them! Do I have to move to England or some other part of area 2 to get it? Please convince the powers that be to get off their #$@%^%$ so the rest of us can enjoy that excellent program!!! Thank you for your help respectfully John Stenger may BBC live forever you are my only source of great programs!!!",1433548800,,459,3.7916666666666665
