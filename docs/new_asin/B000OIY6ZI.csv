8463945,4,B000OIY6ZI,"Wanted to point out something the DVD has incorrect: China's government does not have to deny anything about steam locomotives as the state controlled railway, China Railways, DID retire the last of their steam locomotives around, the latest, the early 2000s.  The only steam locomotivies in operation in China are those operated by private companies, mainly coal and other extraction industries and/or steel producing companies or various other privately held companies that operate railways.  So China's government isn't in ""denial"" as it's the truth that China's state-controlled mainline rail lines don't have steam locomotives on them; private rail operators do however.",1370736000,,675,5.673267326732673
