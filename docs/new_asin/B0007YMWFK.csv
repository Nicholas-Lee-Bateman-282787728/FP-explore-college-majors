2252046,5,B0007YMWFK,"Airwolf is the Star Wars of television series, I mean it is that good.  This show has it all, intriguing storyline, awesome action, great characters, and the best darn original music I have ever heard.  Even to this day the music is still awesome.  It is a shame CBS was so foolish with the Airwolf series, canceling it after 3 short seasons, and that lame shows like Knight Rider, and Magnum PI overshadowed this masterpiece.

On a personal note Airwolf brings back the fondest memories of my childhood.  I remember watching ""The Lady"" with my wonderful grandmother like it was yesterday, dreaming of going on adventures like my favorite super skilled pilot String-Fellow Hawke.  I even built my own model Airwolf over this junk.  Airwolf is the sole reason for my interest in aviation, why I play Namco's Ace Combat series and one of the reasons why I became an Engineer.",1114560000,10,873,4.741721854304636
2252047,5,B0007YMWFK,"Ok, so rating anything that isn't out yet has got to be considered a little presumptious. But I can't help it - this show started it all for me, from childhood daydreams of my own log cabin in the mountains to trying to become a helocopter pilot in the Army to a somewhat more mature admiration for cello music today. Even if it's awful and cheesy when I see it again, it was a seed of a part of me that's still alive and strong today - dreams and ambitions that have endured. And for that it gets 5 stars.

I'm not expecting much, mind you. I do remember the pilot episode quite clearly and if that's anything to go by, we're talking some pretty corny stuff. But the worst of the cliches are cliches purely because they strike such a chord in us. As children we're without walls and experience and we enjoy pure silly theater with a depth of passion that is harder and harder to come by as an adult; we become skeptical and mocking, forgetting how wonderful we found the mystery of a man who only wore white and was called Archangel.

So, no matter how awful, I'll get it and watch it with great relish. This was the stuff of my dreams. Although even then I recognized that one re-used airborne explosion, over and over, as that was the limit of their effects budget. I'm not particularly looking foreward to that explosion ... years have passed and I still get sick of the mere thought of it today. Perhaps they were kind and did a little touch-up work, inserted some variations on that repetitive fireball? I doubt it. Oh, well, can't have everything...",1114300800,14,1556,4.399305555555555
2252048,5,B0007YMWFK,"I watched this show when i ws young and I cant wait to buy it. I know it will be in stores and cant wait to get it. This is must own to have. This show was so cool because of the Helicopter.

So i say you must get this dvd",1114300800,5,222,3.3529411764705883
2252049,5,B0007YMWFK,"What impresses me about Airwolf's first season is the movie-like nature of the plots and action.
The series is not as dated as many of its contemporaries for these reasons:
The locations are remote, not urban (deserts, lakes & valleys)
Plots involve government intelligence and foreign threats
The helicopter is still more advanced than anything out there

Who didn't want to be a pilot when watching Stringfellow Hawke fly high into the Soviet Union to rescue an intelligence mole, or South America or Mexico?  And didn't you find yourself humming that tune now and then?  I sure did.

The first season has James Whitmore Jr., Lance LeGault, Walter Gotell, David Hemmings, Zora Lampert, Ismael Carlo and David Carradine, all in memorable roles.  This is the season that saw Airwolf captured by Libyan operatives, hunted by the CIA and struck by missiles.  In the finale, when Airwolf flies through a B-52 bomb run, Lance LeGault turns a particularly memorable role as the government operative hunting Airwolf.

Although this set contains the full first season, the extra goodies we've come to look for on DVDs are sadly scarce.  However, I have a magazine on this site called ""The Wolf's Lair"" that has them.  It's a great complement to this set.  Look for ASIN B0009JBJC0 or go to [...]",1111017600,24,1288,4.921296296296297
2252050,5,B0007YMWFK,"I remember this show very vividly as a kid. In fact this show is what pushed me to become a helicopter pilot. After seeing this show and the cool helicopter and the great stunts I was hooked.

The whole series is dark and mysterious, and the helicopter has a personality of its own. Great 80's TV, right up there with Knight Rider and Magnum PI. Not to mention this show was created by the same guy who did Magnum PI, Jag, Quantum Leap, etc.

Five stars all the way!",1110931200,13,466,4.224719101123595
2252051,5,B0007YMWFK,"I was wondering when they would put this show on DVD. This was the very last show of my childhood that had not been put on DVD. The A-Team, the incredible Hulk and Nightrider have been sold for a while now. I was afraid this wouldnt take place. If you don't know anything about the show just think about the good 80's shows and that's what this one is also. The helicopter in the show is awesome. I remember as a child I would be playing and imagining that I was flying it with my friends. Yea I know it sounds rather corny now since I'm 27 however it was neat back then.... he he. I work with kids now and I love showing them the old stuff to let them know what a good TV show really is like. The difference now in regards to Action shows is that today kids cant watch them. They are too violent. These shows are some what violent also, however, they don't cross the line and are still family oriented. Bottom line is, if you haven't seen it, still buy it. Its great. If you have seen it, I don't have to say anything else.",1110585600,28,1024,4.074257425742574

I opened the box and took out the two disc dvd box. It looked like this box had been opened previously and re wrapped in plastic. It was confirmed when i took off the plastic wrap as the first disc had 8 scratches across the Disc and the 2nd disc had 3 finger prints and a small scratch. I am returning it and waiting again for a replacement set. Hopefully the next set is really a new dvd disc set.",1448841600,3,562,4.072072072072072

Would have been better designed like Season 2 - 4 was. But with this being Season 1 it was something they tried and then made better going forward I guess.

2252168,2,B0007YMWFK,"I remember watching this as a kid, amazed at the idea of a secret facility to hide the aircraft. As a fan of knight rider I liked the computers in the airplane. KITT still wins tech wise in my book, but a military helicopter like that comes up second. Too bad they didn't really update the lair and stuff. It was more of a hide the technical copter than a ""batcave"" setup. was sad how they killed off the main guy (Longfellow hawk). Kind of ruined it for me.",1420588800,,458,4.157303370786517

But now many years later I know I have a much greater appreciation for not only the music but the Series itself, the paintings, the scenery, the actors and actress's and all the work that went into making the series as enjoyable then as it is now.

The reproduction is very well done. It plays well on both my Blue Ray player and my DVD player. I could not be happier. Everyone did a fantastic job on this and everyone should be congradulated and commended for all their hard work and efforts to bring back something so many of us enjoyed for a very long time.

2252289,5,B0007YMWFK,"Airwolf is a great ship with awesome action. The soundtrack is a perfect match for the super-high tech helicopter's battle scenes. Of course, if I had my way the whole show would just be shots of the ship ... the humans just get in the way, mostly. But at least there is a connection between the characters and Airwolf in the first three seasons. You can believe they are flying it ... even though you know it's really stunt people. In the fourth season, forget it. You don't believe those people are flying the ship, and as a matter of fact, no one was. No new footage was shot. The whole thing was rehashed footage from the original show. There was no real helicopter at all. So avoid the fourth season. It'll just ruin Airwolf for you.",1320624000,,738,4.394160583941606
2252290,3,B0007YMWFK,"Season One (and Two for that matter) rides that subtle line between two things:

1. Awful, terrible, poor everything.  Absolutely phoning in the performances, story, effort, everything.  Nobody cared, nobody got out of their trailer without doing a whole 8-ball of blow.

2. Actually a well-done episode.  Frequently something involving Borgnine who's a genuinely good actor.  Unfortunately, I couldn't care less about the storyline, characters, or anything else, so its just regular bad.

In-between, there are several episodes that are such cheeseball majesty as to restore my faith in God, Jesus, Muhammad, and Pat Sajack.  That's right: when the acting is awkward or terrible, there's some really badass flying scenes that start out in a wooded area, jump to the desert, and then go over to mountains, you've found your sweet spot in the 80s where no amount of dreary Reagan-era reality can bring you down.  Don't tell me Mr. Kruschev -- I got a bucket full of American air power and the laser-guided buffalo chicken wings to dip them in.

The DVD should come with a paper bag with the action figure of Hawk inside so you can watch him fail to act his way out of it.",1317081600,2,1170,4.834170854271357

I must say I was very pleased, it's just as much a blast to watch almost 20 years later.  The helicopter is beautiful, and although I no longer find it a necessity to fist pump during the intro I still very much enjoy the series.  The flight suits and helmets are a bit quirky at this point but when placed in the context of the late 1980's are understandable.

2252316,5,B0007YMWFK,"I loved this show when I was a kid.....always wondered what happened to it. When I came across it on Amazon.com I had to buy it.
Even though the sound is not as sophisticated as what we have in 2008.....it is still a fantastic film if you liked the Airwolf TV series back in 1984-6.  The music was great, all the acting was good, the stories were interesting, special effects were good, and the cinematography was  great.
  Add Jan-Michael Vincent(his acting was great) to all the above and no wonder this show was a hit for Belisaurius. That guy could play ANY part he was given and he played the Stringfellow Hawk role to a T.
He was perfect as the reclusive, sensitive pilot. The camera always seemed to be very good to Jan.
  I was very sad to find out that the series was canceled  after 3 seasons due to Jan's alcohol, drug and other problems. His 1997, 2002, and 2007 TV (20/20 and others are on the internet)interviews gave me some insight into the history of his problems. Wished he could have received help at an early age!!  Alcohol and drugs are such evils !!
Nonetheless,....this Airwolf DVD was great...due in a large part to Jan.  I miss the old Jan and pray for the present day Jan-Michael Vincent.",1214524800,3,1214,4.457013574660634
2252317,5,B0007YMWFK,"I grew up in the 80s loving Airwolf (mostly due to my parents). I've always enjoyed Airwolf as a result of their influence. Once I noticed that season 1 was released, I knew I had to purchase it.

Boy did it bring back memories. Airwolf, even now, is a cool helicopter. While every episode within this season (as I recall there are only 11) aren't the most exciting, the majority are. For those whom have never experienced Airwolf, the pilot sets up the series very well. Every other episode just continues to expand on the pilot, and, of course, have some great scenes with the chopper.

Just for your info, according to Wikipedia, the helicopter that was used during the show was later sold to a hospital in Germany, and ended up becoming a life flight helicopter.",1213142400,3,766,4.583941605839416
2252318,5,B0007YMWFK,"This is just perfection. As good as I remembered it as a kid. All that beautiful action footage, all that awesome espionage, intrigue, dark humor and those state-of-the-art aerials for the Lady from the vision of Aerial Co-ordinator David Jones. But it's the direction and cast performances (sans Caitlin) in this premier season that stand-out for me. Jan-Michael Vincent for all his faults nowadays gave the performance of his career in this season as the broody, reclusive loner, Stringfellow Hawke. Universally-loved veteran, Ernest Borgnine also gave one of his most memorable performances since winning the Oscar for 'MARTY' in the 50's as all-American Dominic Santini.

Stand-out episodes included: 'MIND OF THE MACHINE' (Airwolf vs Airwolf!), 'TO SNARE A WOLF' (the single best episode of the entire show and I'd say of any TV show from the 1980s!), 'BITE OF THE JACKAL', 'AND THEY ARE US' and 'ECHOS FROM THE PAST' are the highlights in this feature-quality season of television that has never really been out-done until maybe the best seasons of '24' etc. for today's audiences.

The sumptuous score, expertly composed by Sylvester Levay is another plus point with a sublime mix of orchestral meets synth, none the least the creation of that iconic Main Themes for the show. So I'd suggest you pair this with the new, digitally-remastered 'Airwolf Themes' soundtrack from Amazon's MP3 downloads section and you've the perfect package to take you into the world of Hawke, Santini, Archangel, Marella and the Lady herself.

2252319,4,B0007YMWFK,"I don't ever remember seeing this show in the 1980s when it first aired but I picked these DVDs up out of curiosity. I'm glad I did.  While the show is a bit corny in some ways (get a load of all the white suits on the FIRM people!)  and they tend to use a lot of noticeable stock footage (does the valley of the gods never get out of Winter?) It has to be said, even after all this time, that the Airwolf helicopter is very cool.

The plots, for the type of show it is, aren't any worse than say ""Magnum PI"" and its still entertaining.  I'll be watching all three seasons of this I think without protest.  If you like helicopters and/or action adventure shows this one is still worth picking up and its easy to see why its described as a cult favourite show.  The acting is average but certainly not as bad as a lot of other shows from this period I could mention.

Just like making movie versions of our fave tv shows..ALWAYS using the SAME names w/different actors. Do the Hollywood ppl not think we wud CARE or be constantly comparing the movie or redone version w/the original?! The shows already redone into new shows/movies probably wudn't be bad at all if the ppl in charge wud've used new character's names, even using siblings or children/decendants of the original characters, that wud be SO much better than watching ppl trying to make a quick buck & redo something that was great into crap. This is a series NOT to be messed with. There would probably be a few disgruntled fans out there, including me, if that happened. I wud DEFINITLY cringe if it did & go ACK! Bottom line...This series is great despite the sometimes bad editing. Don't mess w/a good thing, just keep it like it is. I like the fact that it's not 'upgraded' to be 'remastered' like some shows are. I think it takes away from the originality of it.

2252350,2,B0007YMWFK,"I was really disappointed with this first season of the show. I found it really was hard to figure out what was going on with the storylines, and you really had to pay attention to what was being said in order to figure out what was going on. And I found the subject matter of the show was really hard to get into, and there was nothing relatable other than the fact that this woman who Hawke gets really attached to in the pilot episode dies. He seems really heartbroken about it, but then in episode 2 and so on, he just kind of forgets that it even happened. I would have found it more believable if they would have made it a recurring storyline, and maybe have flashbacks or something. But I found in season 1 they really didn't find their groove yet.

Another thing that disappointed me was the lack of episodes. There was only 2 discs, which contained only 11 episodes. I find this a ripoff when they sell a season of a show which only has half the amount of episodes for the same price as a season that has a full 22 or more episodes. I paid about 44 bucks for each of them. For someone wanting to get into this show though, there is some decent episodes in this set, but most of them are snoozefests. What you really want to do is get past this season and get more into seasons 2-3. So in that sense I do recommend this set. There is some really good stunt work with the helicopter, even though to me the storyline lacks at times.

I only give this set a 2 out of 5 stars.",1196294400,2,1480,4.135416666666667

2252354,5,B0007YMWFK,"Airwolf Season 1, The Myth of Airwolf will not come on DVD is broken. The 1st season was speculative with a 2-hour introduction episode (Like a Movie). It has emerged as a great DVD set that I own.

Airwolf series Season 1 (eleven episodes from 1984) cleverly developed by Donald B. Bellisario (Universal Studios) had a dark perspective on Cold War espionage in which the Libyans and Russians were portrayed as the scheming, black-hatted villains, while U.S. covert intelligence (known as ""the Firm"" in this series) was viewed as heroic despite having its own ambiguous motives.

The stars of this series are ace pilot & reluctant hero Stringfellow Hawke (Jan-Michael Vincent) and his loyal co-pilot, Dominic Santini (Ernest Borgnine) owner of Santini Air (which provides private Helicopter Trips and Helicopter Rentals), who have hidden away Airwolf. The enigmatic fate of Hawke's long-lost brother, St. John Hawke (pronounced as SinJin), who disappeared years before in Vietnam, motivates Hawke to strike a deal with the Firm's director, Archangel (Alex Cord): Hawke & Santini will keep Airwolf hidden and fly it on missions for the Firm until the Firm can conclusively prove what happened to St. John Hawke.

Even now, I'm excited at waiting for Airwolf - Season 2. I recommend this show for anyone looking for a great 80's Action TV series. I'll rate this DVD set 5 stars.",1176076800,3,1376,5.052863436123348

2252387,5,B0007YMWFK,"To own this series on DVD has been a longtime dream of ours, ever since we belatedly discovered Airwolf running in syndication on USA Network.  The original Airwolf, not to be confused with the horrid clone USA tried to make to cash in on the first show, was one of the gems to emerge from the 80's and the mind of Donald P. Bellisario, who also gave us Magnum, PI and Murder, She Wrote.  Unlike those two more pleasant shows, Airwolf began as a dark and brooding mid-season replacement and shot skyward in the ratings.  It parlayed on the high-tech popularity of movies like Blue Thunder and Firefox, and featured good writing, a sound premise, passable special effects, a menacingly sleek and dangerous helicopter, and possibly the coolest theme music to come out of a television series.  To top it off, there was the cast comprised of three former movie stars:  Jan-Michael Vincent as brooding anti-hero and Viet Nam veteran Stringfellow Hawke, haunted by his past; the durable Ernest Borgnine as his old friend and mentor, Dominic Santini; and Alex Cord as the debonair and ambigiously loyal FIRM deputy director, Michael Coldsmith Briggs III, codenamed Archangel.  The final regular was lovely and intellectual Marella, Michael's assistant, played perfectly by Deborah Pratt.  Toss in the Cold War, espionage, high-tech suspense(with just a small dash of human interest elements), and the show started out of the gate an almost assured ratings winner.  The continuing thread for the series was that Hawke had stolen Airwolf back from its demented creator for Archangel but then refused to return it to the spy, instead using it as leverage to force Michael to use his resources to track down String's older MIA brother, St. John.  Archangel in turn has Hawke and Airwolf to run secret missions for him, sometimes without his agency's knowledge or consent.
For the first half-season, Airwolf was fine, some episodes better than others, but none was disappointing; the pilot was awesomely done.  However, CBS interfered with Bellisario's dark vision for the show, changing out Marella for spunky Caitlin O'Shaugnessy(Jean Bruce Scott) and shifting the emphasis from espionage to so much human interest it was almost nauseating.  Fortunately, the third season turned the trend back around to some degree, but by then Bellisario was more or less gone, listed merely as ""Executive Producer"" in the credits.
This DVD, then, is the best of the show.  All of the brooding darkness, the ambiguity especially regarding Archangel's loyalties, the crossfire between Santini and Archangel that was almost reminiscent of McCoy and Spock from classic Star Trek, the misery and sweetness of Hawke's character, everything that made this program so unique is at its best in this set of episodes.  Of this set, the pilot episode ""Shadow of the Hawke"" remains at the top in terms of quality:  five stars.
In descending order are the others(at least in our opinion)
Bite of the Jackal****1/2
One Way Express****1/2
Fight Like a Dove****
And They Are Us****
Echoes From the Past****
Proof Through the Night****
Mad Over Miami***1/2
Mind of the Machine***1/2
Daddy's Gone A-Hunting***
Even the worst of this set is still pretty solid---better than the later seasons and vastly superior to the drek that USA tried to produce with a second-rate cast, mediocre writing and awful effects.  As die-hard fans of the original series, we will purchase more of these DVDs as they become available, but this first one is a great way for someone unfamiliar with Airwolf to see why it was such a great show.  Too bad Jan-Michael Vincent's personal problems escalated and they had to cancel it way too soon. . . .",1150070400,8,3682,5.011475409836065
2252388,4,B0007YMWFK,"Before the shows JAG, NCIS, Magnum PI and Quantum Leap, There was Airwolf. Created by Donald P. Bellisario, this action adventure story involving a Blue Thunder like miltary helcopter. The show had a good cast involved. Such show performers as Jan-Micheal Vincent(as Stringfellow Hawke), Alex Cord (as Archangel), and Ernest Borgnine (as Dominic) make this show watchable.

The adventure show is not just about the helcopter-its the people who handle the choper. The agency (the government shadow agency)  headed by Archangel sends Hawke on mission and Dominic helps. It never said what kind of agent is he, nor do we need to know

 There was only 11 episodes in the first season. This box set included the  two hour pilot. The bad news is there NO EXTRAS, however the episodes are rewards in themselves.  These shows  barely ages itself from when they came out in 1984

I am sorry to say that whoever was at Universal and oversaw the production of this dvd should be ashamed. No attention to detail as anyone that knows Airwolf realizes that Barry Van Dyke was not in the original series but he is featured on the box. No extras of any type and at only a half season, pricing like many of the other studios is bad. I mean come now, should we have to pay full price for a 11 episodes when they will charge us again the same price for 22 plus?! The scary part is that The A-Team, Knight Rider and Magnum P.I. at least got some marketing behind their releases and they continue to be released regularly. Universal missed the boat by not including a popular show like Airwolf in that mix. I hope that better heads prevail and realize that they need to treat this show better and release the rest of the seasons. Like the other shows, we know their are plenty of value added bonus features they can include. Let's hope they get better because so far Universal is weak with most of their bare minimum tv show releases. Anyone remember how bad Universal treated Buck Rogers when it came out on DVD, they cancelled a simple commentary by Erin Gray and Gil Gerard and did not include any bonus features.

As such, Airwolf was acceptable as TV fare. Vincent was 'one-taking' his way through Hollywood, Borgnine (one of the best character actors EVER!) was backing Jan-Michael on the heroic shots, and Alex Cord had a steady supply of gorgeous ladies, all dressed in white as good guys and angels.

Oh boy was it dated! But it was a good series at the time. And I STILL like the theme music AND that beautiful Bell 222 (although they could re-do the series now with a Bell 430 and get better flight characteristics; a 4-blade main can actually DO a loop!).

And the other reviewer that complained about pricing should take a look at Paramount's prices for ANYTHING Star Trek; they set Trek Season sets at 3 times the price for CSI, and yet CSI is still in production, and more popular than Trek EVER was (and I'm an OLD Trekkie!).

2252434,4,B0007YMWFK,"I really enjoyed watching this.  I absolutley loved this show when I was a kid.  Sure there are the same nitpicking things that are found some of the other 80's shows like the same plane exploding in every episode, the same mountain range even though they are supposed to be in Mexico, Alaska, or even over seas.  But it was a pleasure to see Jan-Michael and Ernest again.

All in all I rate this a 4 out of 5.  I would have given it 5 stars if it had more value.  There is only 11 episodes in the first season and for $30 it's not quite the value of some of the other TV on DVD offerings out there.",1123459200,,599,3.991596638655462
2252435,5,B0007YMWFK,"Well it was about time. I have been a huge airwolf fan ever since it premiered on network television in the 1980's. A TV series of this calibre should have been released on DVD a long time ago! This DVD collection is a little thin on the extras or ""Goodies"" you see in a lot of boxed sets, but the digital transfer on both the audio and video side is superb. If you are an airwolf fan, or a fan of such shows as ""Knight Rider"", ""Seaquest DSV"" or other such shows that feature high tech, futuristic devices or vehicles such as myself then this item is WELL worth the price.",1123372800,,572,4.162162162162162
2252436,5,B0007YMWFK,"Airwolf is certainly not ""art"" and I doubt anyone will ever compare Casablanca to Airwolf, but is sure fun.  The acting is bad, the melodrama is laid on a little thick at times, the plot was thin at times, but it was still a fun show.  I have always wanted to buzz around the So. Cal. desert in a Mach-1 helicopter.  :-)

When this show was actually on as a series, I had to work on Saturday evenings and often missed it.  I never saw the series pilot (probably one of the worst Airwolf episodes ever shot) so now after almost 20 years I got to see it.

When this show was on I became really interested in helicopters.  The nearby medical center purchased a Bell 222B for air med work.  On the week of delivery, it crashed and burned (everyone got out okay) on the street next to my apartment and right in front of my eyes.  As horrifying as that was to watch, I was fascinated by the sleek design of the 222.  The Bell 222 (and now the Bell 422) remains the hottest looking helicopter in the air.

I ordered the first season DVDs the week they became available and spent that entire week's evenings watching (and sometimes watching twice) each episode.  I am anxiously awaiting the release of season 2.

While the DVD set does have kludgy navigation menus, double-side DVDs, and no special features, it is still a great addition to my collection.",1123372800,,1347,4.383064516129032
2252437,5,B0007YMWFK,"This series was one of the best in its day!!!  Its too bad Jan-Michael Vincent decided to turn to alcohol so heavily, thus ending the series.  However, while it was here you had a great storyline with an exceptional cast.  Ernest Bornine plays a easy going character, Dominic Santini, who is the owner of Santini Air.  Dom is the only surviving family friend of Stringfellow Hawke (Jan-Michael Vincent).  People will remember Ernest Borgnine from his earlier series, ""McHale's Navy"", and he brings that same great wit to this series.  Alex Cord plays Michael Colesmith-Briggs III codename Archangel, who is one of the higher-ups (executives) at the firm (CIA) that developed Airwolf along with its creator, Dr. Henry Moffet (David Hemmings).

This show is a roller-coaster ride from the beginning, and Sylvester Levay's terrific score blends right into the show!!  If ""24"" were to add a suped-up Bell222B to Jack Bower's arsenal, then you'd almost have a modern day Airwolf!!

The only downside to this DVD set is the lack of extras that we're all used to.  However, if you liked shows such as Knight Rider, The A-Team, MacGyver, and Magnum P.I., then this would be a great addition to you collection!!",1122854400,,1202,4.935323383084577
2252438,4,B0007YMWFK,One of the better shows in the 80s along with Knight Rider.  Airwolf is and excellent show.  The best episode is the first one with the showdown with Moffett.  Acting was a bit stiff.  I wish there were more extras for the DVD version.,1122681600,,235,4.2727272727272725
2252449,4,B0007YMWFK,"I have been purchasing my old favorite TV shows on DVD as they come out. I have also been sorely sorry in some cases, as the shows aren't as great as I remember them... Airwolf is the exception.  The show is as clever and fun to watch as I remember it, and despite the stock footage, it is truly enjoyable to watch.  They best part is, that a lot of the technology that was sci-fi at the time of Airwolf is now in use in Army's Apache and Comanche choppers.  The only reason I didn't give this all 5 stars is that the production value of the set is a little lame... Slow hard to navigate menu's that don't allow you to play one episode after another without returning to the menu, and double sided DVD's (the bane of chubby fingers like mine) I would rather pay a little bit more and have the set put out on 4 separate discs in slim-line cases.",1122336000,,844,4.134146341463414
2252450,3,B0007YMWFK,"The first season of AIRWOLF was a bit cheesy, but the second season was far better. The biggest problem was the lack of plot

other than the ""Find my brother, boo-hoo"" attitude of String.

I was fortunate enough to get up to about episode 7 or 8 in the second season before the provider's supplies were exhausted.

I have heard nothing about the future of their supplies, so this

is, at least, hope. If the second season is released as a set, it is MUCH better than the first, but I recommend getting the first season so you can at least have the necessary continuity...",1120348800,3,571,4.40952380952381
2252451,1,B0007YMWFK,"WOW, what a disappointment. Just to set the stage, I have been a huge helicopter fan for years, and continue to be one, which, of course is why I bought this DVD set. While the concept is sound, the execution is extremely shoddy. The only reason I can see why I liked it originally was I was a lot younger!

The main problem is the unbelievably bad continuity and editing. One reviewer pointed out that the combat scenes were clumsily edited but it goes well beyond that. For the most part, 90% of the flying (and other) footage seems to have come from the series pilot. In every succeeding episode, they trot out the same old footage... Airwolf taking off from the desert cavern, for example. As I mentioned, the continuity is atrocious. One minute it's pitch black and they're using night vision, the next, an exterior shot shows Airwolf flying in broad daylight over a field of cows. Similarly, one minute you're over a snow-covered desert landscape, then the very next, it's a summer scene. Not only is this visually jarring, it's just plain stupidity.

Moments you can't forget (and neither can they) are the jeep entering the hidden cavern hideaway with a single driver (although in the previous scene, there's two people in the jeep); the ever annoying scene of the jeep stopping in front of the chopper while either String alone or String and Dom sit enraptured looking at the bird (never mind they have a tight schedule to save the world).

Character-wise, Jan-Michael seems fairly wooden, while Alex Cord is eternally righteously indignant, and the villains, with the exception of the ever-wonderful David Hemmings, are simply mundane. The best one of all is Ernest Bourgnine, whose crusty portrayal of Dominic Santini is always able to entertain. Second would be the dog that has a habit of looking up the female players' skirts! Come to think of it, there are a few major babes in the show.

While there is certainly some great nap-of-the-earth flying of the tricked out Bell 222c copter, as well as supporting aircraft, the real shame is that there is neither any info on the bird itself, nor any credit to the real pilots of the series.

Want to really get some Airwolf excitement? Then get Microsoft Fight Simulator 2004 and download the Airwolf aircraft and fly it yourself! You can do this for about the same coin that you'll waste on this turkey.

If you are intrested in Airwolf its probably because you watched it originally when it was on TV and enjoyed it then - thats why I bought this.

Also if you look at the photos on the back of the box you will notice that two of the photos are not even from season one of Airwolf! They are photos from season 4 and are of St. John Hawke starring Barry Van Dyke and Anthony Sherwood who plays Jason Locke.

2252455,4,B0007YMWFK,"A lot of reviews are harping on the fact that this DVD collection doesn't have any extras.  Now myself personally, I'll always purchase a movie with extras rather than without.

But considering the fact that I've waited 20 years for this to finally come out on DVD, it doesn't matter to me that there are no extra's.

Sure, I would've loved to hear Airwolf in surround sound, but I'll take what I can get.  After watching every episode on tape (and trust me, they are quite worn out), it was refreshing to watch it in clear quality again.  Yes, I too was hopeful for extras and special features, but now I'm just glad I have it on DVD, something that will keep much longer than my tapes have.

The show has always stood on it's own, before the horrible cast/production changes.  That is when I stopped watching.  But if you are a true fan of the show, there's no reason not to purchase this DVD set.

And if you've never seen it?  I highly recommend it.  This show has actual plots, amazing special effects for it's time (even if they re-use a few shots in each episode).  The acting is excellent, and the true star of the show, Airwolf, makes it all worth while.

Plus the fact that it isn't as expensive as some of today's shows?  (See X-files, still close to $100.00, unreal!).  You are truely getting a bargain here; I would've paid $100 even without the special features.",1119484800,3,1376,4.448

Most of the plots in this collection have held up better than those of other shows of the same era.  Then again, maybe that's only because I recognized the implausibility of most of them the first time around as a 12-year old - but no matter!  Stringfellow Hawke is still the ultimate anti-hero, angry at the world and frosty with nearly everyone he meets, but willing to risk life, limb and treason to help his friends.  (And really, it's okay to be slightly amused at the fact that Jan Michael Vincent has since turned into the very sort of misanthrope he played here!)  Most of the stories have a great edge-of-the-world suspense to them, even if you know the outcome of the battle is a foregone conclusion once String gets into the helicopter.  And the series is now old enough to have a couple of unintentionally funny moments.  Most notable among these is the case of Hawke being duped into believing he's been in a coma for a year, thanks in part to a fake news show with an explosive scoop...Prince Charles and Princess Diana getting a divorce!  (I guess it really would have been explosive in 1984, after all.)

And no, there are no extras.  But so what?  Great entertainment doesn't need a voiceover telling you why it's great entertainment 20 years after the fact, if you ask me.",1119312000,6,1510,4.5

When I found out that a legitimate DVD edition was on the way out, I was hopeful that some DVD goodies would be included, such as some behind the scenes footage, interviews, etc.

When I purchased the 1st season set, I was appalled to find that Universal definately took the budget route for this title, not including ANY extras at all unless you want to consider a short episode synopsis for each episode or the Universal ads an 'extra'. (It even shows in the cover art, unfortunately..) The main ""meat and potatoes"", however, is in the episodes and they are perfect in this DVD transfer with great sound. Being able to relive childhood memories of the show was worth the price of the purchase, and although the clothing and costumes are dated by today's standards the plot and characters are still interesting and intriquing.

Overall, I gave this box set 3 stars- mainly owing to the episodes themselves. What killed theother two stars for me was the total lack of any extras or effort of any kind on the part of Universal.",1118016000,5,1193,4.570093457943925
2252458,5,B0007YMWFK,"I think the DVD of this abbreviated season of AIRWOLF is stupendous, but now that they have this complete 1st Season of Airwolf on DVD, I think they should plan on making a DVD of AIRWOLF's complete 2nd Season, which was Airwolf's 1984-85 Season on CBS, which should be even better than Airwolf-Season 1, because I think the Second Season of AIRWOLF was better & more upgraded than the First Season is.

So now I cant wait to see Airwolf's complete 2nd Season and I cant wait till they make a DVD of AIRWOLF- Season 2, which should be even better, especially since the 2nd Season of AIRWOLF has a lot more episodes than the 1st Season does, plus the 2nd Season of AIRWOLF is also when co-pilot Caitlyn O'Shaunessy(Jean Bruce Scott) joins the cast of AIRWOLF too, but I personally think the 3rd Season of Airwolf is the best season of that show, not to mention that Airwolf's 3rd Season was my favorite season, which was the 1985-86 Season of Airwolf on CBS.

It was also interesting seeing Shannon Doherty in the ""Bite Of The Jackal"" episode before she was even famous and before her days on OUR HOUSE, BEVERLY HILLS 90210, and CHARMED, which was of course before Shannen Doherty's reputation went sour after being fired from BEVERLY HILLS 90210.

Therefore, you could say that seeing Shannon Doherty on AIRWOLF and watching her on OUR HOUSE were Shannen Doherty's better and more likeable days before her reputation and popularity was tarnished.

This season also takes me all the way back to memory lane when AIRWOLF was in competition with BLUE THUNDER, except BLUE THUNDER didn't last unlike AIRWOLF, especially since AIRWOLF K.O.'d BLUE THUNDER in the ratings especially since AIRWOLF was a more upgraded Superchopper than BLUE THUNDER was as well.

Therefore, AIRWOLF had some hefty competition going on with KNIGHT RIDER at the time as well, since there were so many advantages and disadvantages between AIRWOLF and the Knight 2000 as well as similarities in features, but KNIGHT RIDER still had better ratings than AIRWOLF did along with the fact that KNIGHT RIDER lasted longer than AIRWOLF did too, since CBS had cancelled the old AIRWOLF around the same time NBC had cancelled KNIGHT RIDER back in 1986 since the premiere of STREET HAWK on ABC in the Winter of 1985 started giving viewers too much of the same thing every weekend since ABC had STREET HAWK on Friday nights, CBS had AIRWOLF on Saturday nights, and NBC had KNIGHT RIDER on Sunday nights which started giving viewers too much competition & redundancy especially since all 3 Universal high-tech dramas premiered too close after one another since KNIGHT RIDER premiered on NBC in the Fall of 1982, AIRWOLF debuted on CBS in the Winter of 1984, and STREET HAWK debuted on ABC in the Winter of 1985, but had only lasted 9 weeks.

Therefore, STREET HAWK not only led to its own cancellation in the Spring of 1985, but had also ended up leading to the cancellation of AIRWOLF & KNIGHT RIDER in the Spring of 1986 since people got bored & burned out with these futuristic high-tech shows since AIRWOLF was too closely related to KNIGHT RIDER & STREET HAWK making the special-effects a lot less impressive & a lot less convincing on top of that.

It was also interesting seeing
*Lance LeGault in the ""To Snare A Wolf"" episode during his co-starring days as the hard-nosed Army nemesis(Col. Decker) on THE A-TEAM

*James Whitmore, Jr. in the ""Daddy's Gone A-Hunting"" episode before his co-starring days as Hunter & McCall's dorky fellow officer(Sgt. Bernie Terwilliger)

*Ismael Carlo in the ""Mad Over Miami"" episode before his co-starring days on SANTA BARBARA and GENERAL HOSPITAL

*Jeffrey Mackay in the ""To Snare A Wolf"" episode after his co-starring days as Magnum's old navy buddy(Mac) on MAGNUM, P.I.

*Henry Darrow in the ""One Way Express"" episode before his co-starring days on SANTA BARBARA and after his co-starring days on GENERAL HOSPITAL

*David Carradine in the ""Mind Over Machine"" episode after his co-starring days on KUNG FU

*Chad Allen in the ""Daddy's Gone A Huntin"" episode before his co-starring days on OUR HOUSE & DR. QUINN MEDICINE WOMAN

*Leann Hunley in the ""One Way Express"" episode during her co-starring days on DYNASTY and before her co-starring days on DAYS OF OUR LIVES

I also liked the way Universal provided each of these 1st Season episodes original air-date along with a brief summary of their titles

For instance, the original air-dates to each of these episodes on CBS was
1/22/84-SHADOW OF THE HAWKE(Aka The Pilot Episode)
1/28/84-DADDY'S GONE A HUNTIN'
2/4/84-BITE OF THE JACKAL
2/11/84-PROOF THROUGH THE NIGHT

2252469,4,B0007YMWFK,"The DVD release of ""Airwolf: Season One"" will likely prove to be a mixed blessing for its fans.

The Series and Its Premise:

Airwolf's first season (eleven episodes from 1984) cleverly developed the series' dark (and sometimes heavy-handed) perspective on Cold War espionage in which the Libyans and Russians were portrayed as the scheming, black-hatted villains, while U.S. covert intelligence (known as ""the Firm"" in this series) was viewed as heroic, white-hatted cowboys, despite having its own ambiguous motives.

Caught in the middle are brooding ace pilot & reluctant hero Stringfellow Hawke (Jan-Michael Vincent) and his loyal co-pilot, Dominic Santini (Ernest Borgnine), who have hidden away the most awesome aerial assault weapon on earth: Airwolf.  The enigmatic fate of Hawke's long-lost brother, St. John, who disappeared years before in Vietnam, motivates Hawke to strike a thieves' bargain with the Firm's director, Archangel (Alex Cord): Hawke & Santini will keep Airwolf stashed and fly it on secret missions for Archangel until the Firm can conclusively prove St. John's fate.

With this bold premise, and backed by Sylvester Levay's memorably techno-styled score, the series kicked off the first season with its best episode ever: the movie-length ""Shadow of the Hawke,"" featuring Hawke's fiery showdown with Airwolf's psychotic creator, Charles Henry Moffett (David Hemmings) in the Libyan desert.  Flashbacks to scenes from this particular episode would hauntingly reverberate throughout the series.

Also featured in Season One are some relatively superb (if sometimes implausible) entries such as: ""Echoes of the Past,"" ""Mind of the Machine,"" ""And They Are Us,"" and ""To Snare a Wolf,"" in which Hawke must fly Airwolf through a B-52 bombing run to elude a renegade U.S. government operative intent on obtaining or destroying Airwolf at any cost.

At the same time, some of the other episodes from Season One remain merely OK, if not forgettable. For instance, the second episode, ""Daddy's Gone a Huntin',"" comes to mind, as the intriguing idea of Hawke discovering a long-lost son from Vietnam is toyed with before being ultimately dropped. Further, due in part to an unconvincing make-up job, the young actor (Chad Allen) portraying Hawke's possible son was simply a ludicrous casting choice given the circumstances of the episode.

Nonetheless, despite its occasional flaws, ""Airwolf"" was far more sophisicated and intelligently written than any other program in the action-adventure genre for that era.

Disc 1 (Side A):
1. ""Shadow of the Hawke"" (pilot episode): 5 *****
2. ""Daddy's Gone a Huntin'"": 3 ***
3. ""Bite of the Jackal"": 4 ****
  (Side B):
4. ""Proof Through the Night"": 4 1/2 ****
5. ""One Way Express"": 3 1/2 ***

Disc 2 (Side A):
1. ""Echoes from the Past"": 4 1/2 ****
2. ""Fight Like a Dove"": 4 ****
3. ""Mad Over Miami"": 3 1/2 ***
4. ""And They Are Us"": 4 ****
  (Side B):
10. ""Mind of the Machine"": 4 1/2 ****
11. ""To Snare a Wolf"": 4 1/2 ****

Rating of Season One episodes: 4 1/2 **** (overall)

The DVD Edition:

Universal Studios, unfortunately, chose to pursue the absolute ""bare bones"" approach with this release by:

1. With the exception of choosing from three standard languages, there are not any special features.  The DVD is completely devoid of cast and crew interviews, commentaries, documentaries, an Airwolf blueprint, or even a snazzy main menu screen.  Considering how deliberately ""techno"" this series was, the potential special features available could have been awesome.  Instead, this is a major disappointment.

2. The episodes are not re-mastered, nor were the audio tracks noticeably upgraded. Very ordinary.

3. The few promo photos inexplicably include cast pictures from the dreaded fourth season (without Vincent or Borgnine).

Rating of DVD Packaging & Extras (overall): 1 *

If you choose to purchase ""Airwolf: Season One,"" beware you are getting a half-season's worth of mostly terrific episodes (but little else).  Still, we believe this DVD set is well worth the investment at its current price.",1117497600,87,4065,5.204301075268817
2252470,4,B0007YMWFK,"First, some people seem concerned with the packaging and the menu and the extra content.  The packaging is cheap, the menu is pathetic, and the extra content does not exist.  Personally, I don't really care, but if that sort of thing bothers you, there you go.  My thinking is, if Universal is being cheap to make it more cost-effective to release somewhat obscure TV shows, I'm cool with that--bring on The Equalizer!

Next, the acting and writing is not as bad as many shows of the time--or today--but there is certainly far, far better.  Related to this was the drift away from the moodiness of the first season in subsequent seasons--like Keanu Reeves, Jan-Michael Vincent is probably best left to act to his strengths, such as they are, which appears to be what he was doing in the first season to good effect.  I always thought, and still do, that the perfect accompaniment to a super-helicopter built by a secret government agency is a moody pilot extraordinaire who lives in a remote cabin in the mountains.  Far-fetched though it is.

OK, so is this DVD worth getting?  I never questioned buying it myself, but even so, I was a little concerned whether it would be as enjoyable to watch now as when I was younger.  The answer is, not quite, but close enough.  And it's all about the helicopter, so I'd say not to bother getting this if you weren't a fan of Airwolf to begin with, or don't like helicopters.  This show is about Airwolf, a completely impossible helicopter that is still way cool.  The switches flip, the buttons are pressed, the eerie howling noise begins with the muted whop-whop of the rotors, and off goes this gorgeous, dangerous, awesome machine to do good deeds around the world.

My father taped all the Airwolf shows when they first ran...I eventually made a tape of all the first season 'finales'--the end sequences where Airwolf kicked flying butt.  That's how much I liked that helicopter, and I still do.  So, although I now wince a bit at the clothes, the writing, and some of the acting--I never liked Borgnine anyway--I still get a thrill watching that helicopter.  Yes, they re-use flying sequences too much, but so do many shows.  The bottom line is...If you were an Airwolf fan back then, I think it's safe to go ahead and get this DVD.

You know, someone should redo this series, along the lines of Battlestar Galactica.  Throw out the hokiness, and keep the good stuff--in this case, keep the helicopter, most of the conceptual background, and little else.",1117497600,62,2500,4.703448275862069
2252471,4,B0007YMWFK,"I have both positive and negative things to say about this DVD release. I'm going to start out with the positive ones first, because they will be most key to a potential customer's buying decision.

If you are a fan of Airwolf, there is *simply no question whatsoever* you need to buy this set, and whatever others may come out after. Failing everything else, the video and audio reproduction are excellent for what they are, and for the era they were made in (in other words, no hisses, pops, etc.) And, while it's true that there are different versions of the pilot in existence, the one on this set is solid and still resonates true to the original core spirit of the show. And yes, Season 1 is the unquestionably darkest season of Airwolf.

However, that's where the positive comments end and the negative ones begin.

Some slight explanation is in order for the unwarry or unfamiliar. Airwolf lasted approximately 4 seasons. The first three had a common cast (except for adding Caitlin O'Shannessy, played by Jean Bruce Scott) and were arguably of better quality. To save costs and such, Season 4 was moved to Canada, where the ENTIRE cast was replaced. Suffice it to say the production values, story lines, etc., were incredibly poor. Yet it's THAT cast which Universal decided to stick on the back of the box. Huh?!?!?

The DVD on-screen menus are very basic, lacking any background music, movement, or special effects. There is also absolutely no behind-the-scenes materials, secondary audio track running commentary or interviews with any of the principles (all of whom I might remind everybody are still alive at the time I write this review!) Yes, I know that Jan-Michael Vincent became an alcoholic, drug addict and abusive spouse during the course of this show and his personal life has essentially been ruined since, but that's no excuse to punish everyone else in the production.

If I may be candid, I think what happened, here, folks, is the same thing that happened with Universal's Buck Rogers DVD release: the studio did not want to pay the actors and others any money to do interviews or secondary audio track commentary, and I'll be willing to bet none of the actors are getting a penny from this DVD's release (as is most definitely the case with the Buck Rogers DVD). Don't believe me on that one? Go talk to Gil Gerard (who played Buck Rogers), Erin Gray, or Thom Christopher in person at any convention and they'll personally verify the fact.

** HOWEVER ** On much happier news, there is an international fan club in existance for Airwolf, and one of it's members, Mark Cairns, has teamed up with series music creator Sylvester Levay to reproduce via new, high-fidelity stereo recording, all or as much of the series' music as they can. One such limited run, double CD release has already broken all sorts of records for resale value, selling for over $700 on eBay (not bad considering how much it originally sold for). A new double CD set is in the works. Do a search on the Internet for ""Airwolf soundtrack"" and you'll find it.",1117411200,3,3056,4.745762711864407

I hope that the studios will continue to release the remaining two original seasons and any outtakes and unaired footage in succession to this package.  I can't wait to see the DVD's, as I have all the original episodes (on Super Betamax tape no less) yet still need this collection in DVD also.  This was a great adventure show with a great budget!",1116892800,2,449,4.518518518518518
2252473,4,B0007YMWFK,"Ok, lets be realistic here... This is THE 80's show about a superweapon that is basically unstoppable.  Yes we've had this before with Knight Rider but in this case we have the awesome theme music and some excellent acting. (at least concerning the 1st season)
So I'd go out on a limb here and say its the best show of the 80's.  However the presentation is lacking....
- Menu design is lacking any color or ""life""
- No background music in menu's, no animations
- Poor box design... I can do better in photo-paint
- No attempt at cleaning up the image grain or sound
- 2.0 mono... thats right mono,  couldn't you at least give us some sort of half assed stereo? Who doesn't have some sort of sound system in 2005?
- The pilot is edited to the TV verison, there is a ""movie"" verison which I own which contains some swearing and revised music (better music)
+ Its Airwolf
+ The first season is considered the best
+ The Music",1116892800,3,923,4.323699421965318
2252474,3,B0007YMWFK,"I was looking forward so much to purchasing my Airwolf DVD set, that I forgot all about the shortcommings that one of the greatest shows fom the 80's fell victim to. First of all, I'd give Airwolf a 5/5 for just being an awesome show. Bluethunder never came close to Airwolf! But lets get to the root of the new set:

-First of all the box for season one has pictures on the back from the WORST season (4), and is missing far more note worthy shots of ""the lady"" and the cast. I could have designed a better package than the one final production box, not to mention it seems tha the box print work has been applied in reverse to standard DVD boxes (ie the front of the box should have the DVD's slide in from the right NOT the left).

-Secondly the cases for the DVD's are the full size cases, which are OK, but most of the new DVD releases have moved to the slim line cases - these big bulky cases lead you to believe that you are getting more than you actually are. There isn't even a picture or book in either of the cases - just a plain double sided DVD.

-Thirdly, the DVD menu offers very little in design features, including NO extras what so ever from a show that so many people have searched all over the internet in search of behind the scenes pictures, clips, and cast interviews. One wonders what the people who produced it were thinking - sadly,it seemes that the shows monetary issues from the 80's are still present in post-production.

-Upon searching for a release date for season 2, it seems that there is no sign of it until the end of 2005 or later  - ie no results ANYWHERE where specific.

-The only good thing - which is the most important is the quality of the show. 5/5 for FINALLY bringing back a great show that met with such an unfortunate demise. Episode audio and video quality are great - so I guess that when you really want something that has been so hard to get, you should be more than happy with the quality of a bare bones DVD set that does deliver on the show.",1116892800,11,1998,4.217277486910994
2252475,4,B0007YMWFK,"The only reason I did not give this 5 stars was the pilot.  My VHS copy of the pilot episode is the British version with all the language.  Plus, the DVD version of the pilot lacks the scene where Moffet wipes out a military training camp for the Libyans.  They also have an alternate version of the scene where Moffet destroys only TWO French ""Mirages""--which were actually old-model Russian MiGs...the scene lacked the comical elevator in the department store comments Moffet made.  It did include a few scenes here and there that were not in the British version, though.  One such scene was where Hawke and Santini were scouting out the location to eventually hide Airwolf.  All in all, a good buy.",1116892800,2,701,4.704918032786885
2252476,5,B0007YMWFK,"Two thoughts that come to mind when thinking of Airwolf.  First, Hollywood royality is not found in touch feely finding yourself dramas, with crying men and women going around hugging each other.  Its found in top secret helicopters deep within a mountain ready to unleash the fury all over evil doers every where.  Plus Jan Michael Vincent is truly the gem of American televison.  And who wouldn't want Dom as a side kick.",1116892800,,423,4.7534246575342465
2252477,5,B0007YMWFK,"Ho One can ever own this... ONLY I CAN!!!! Ha ha ha!!! I got cha!!! This is my best TV show ever when I was a kid. No other TV shows can come close to Airwolf even thugh I like them too mainly The A Team, Knight Rider, Blue Thunder, Macgyver, Streethawk and many more.... I use to record to VHS cassettes and label them Airwolf 1, 2 and so forth.. but today all my VHS are unplayable due to fungus. Now this release on DVD is just the right timing for me.... Yahoo!!!! Hawk, Airwolf and company is finally conquering the world again after such a long hiatus!!! Long Live Airwolf!!",1116633600,,580,4.1875
2252478,3,B0007YMWFK,"While I liked this show and grew up watching it alongside my other favorite 80s classics like Knight Rider (my personal fave) and The A-Team, it never really captured my attention like the aforementioned 2 did. These 3 shows ran in re-runs back to back -- starting with Knight Rider, then Airwolf, then The A-Team. For me, KR was a must see! Never got tired of it! The A-Team I also tried not to miss. But now Airwolf was the one sandwiched in the middle, so I sometimes watched it and sometimes didn't. That one I could skip more or less. As I got a little older, though, I started to appreciate the show and tried not to miss it. I especially loved the aerial battles at the end (some, of course, we're better than others). Also some of the show's best eps (Sweet Britches, Firestorm, HX1, Flight #093 is Missing, The Horn of Plenty, Discovery, Airwolf II, Kingdom Come, Tracks--yes, I said Tracks!) are in the second & third seasons. That takes us to the first season. I know I'm in the minority, but I never cared much for the 1st season of Airwolf. It's praised for its dark and serious tone and rich character development, but for me therein lies the problem. I think there's just way too much character study and too little action (and with an action-oriented show like Airwolf that's a problem). Take the pilot episode for example - it started off brilliantly with an awesome score and adrenaline-pumped aerials, but after Moffett escapes to Lybia with Airwolf, the `boredom' factor sets in big time as character development goes into over-drive. We then have to wait all the way till the very end to see some more Airwolf action (the showdown between String and Moffett in the desert) - and for a 2-hour episode that's not a good thing. They should've taken an example from the outstanding Knight Rider pilot, which was appropriately dark but mixed in with some humor as well, and the action was evenly distributed throughout the 2 hours - there wasn't a dull moment! Unfortunately, such was not the case with the Airwolf pilot... The highlights of the first season for me were Bite of the Jackal, Echoes From the Past, Mad Over Miami, And They Are Us, and To Snare a Wolf. However, this season was also plagued by some really boooooring turkeys like Daddy's Gone-A-Hunt'n, Proof Through the Night, and Fight Like A Dove (watching these feels like watching grass grow...). The other episodes not mentioned were rather forgettable. Seeing as how I'm not the greatest Airwolf fan out there, I'm not likely to rush to the store to start my Airwolf collection (the way I'm doing with Knight Rider), but I might be tempted to pick up the second season if it's released. The first season, though, just isn't worth it. It was fairly short (only 11 eps) and the majority of these just don't do anything for me. The show did hit its stride IMO with the second season, so stay tuned...

P.S.  The opening theme song truly is mesmerizing and second in its greatness only to the unbeatable tune of Knight Rider!",1114646400,7,3008,4.610074626865671

8054182,5,B0007YMWFK,"This is the beast deal on amazon for Airwolf Season 1 for the standard DVD format.  I got mine for $6.99 and love watching this series with my kids.  They absolutely love Airwolf and it reminds me of when I was a kid watching this show.  All 11 episodes are included and in the full frame 1.33:1 aspect ratio.  The first season is not rated, but I did notice in the pilot episode some make out scenes and bedroom scene (no frontal or full nudity) that may be questionable for children under 13.  Other than that, it's a great show that the whole family will enjoy and lots of explosions!!!!

Ernest Borgnine as DOM was easily my favorite char, such a good dude and made airwolf in my opinion.  Jean Michael Vincent as Stringfellow Hawk was cool, but I always felt like he was a diva.  Also LOL @ Stringfellow playing the cello on the lake with the wind blowing through his hair!  Regardless of this, I love the first season of Airwolf and highly recommend this.",1466726400,3,961,4.3841807909604515
