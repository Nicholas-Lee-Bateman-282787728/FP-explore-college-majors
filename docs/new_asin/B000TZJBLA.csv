8211525,3,B000TZJBLA,This series was okay but I guess I expected more! Either more skin or more action and story elements but quite frankly it should have had more of both a lack luster but something that could be used to past the time!,1375574400,,215,4.142857142857143
8211526,5,B000TZJBLA,"This item was a very nice addition to our growing collection of great Japanese anime. The box set case and cover sleeve were unmarked. All of the discs were in perfect condition and all played well. For the Tenjho Tenge series itself, I would have to say that it is one of the best anime series I have watched. There are a lot of good ones out there but they're only just good because they seem to ""start"" already in the middle of something and end two seasons short of a decent close of the story line. Tenjho Tenge has a back story that you get a little lateer in the series but it still has good well rounded starting point. It has a great story line and brings the story to a nice ""answer most of your questions"" ending. Of course being the only guy in our family, I have to end this review by adding that it also has plenty of the ""anime basics"" in great fighting, lots of weapon play and, of course lots of hot ladies in skimpy outfits in the middle of the majority of the action. If you're not trying to be the next movie critic and just like to watch some good anime now and then, you'll love Tenjho Tenge.",1320451200,,1114,4.138248847926267
8211527,3,B000TZJBLA,"This dvd wasn't all that great it has some cool scenes and is not as sci fi based anime as most its more of knowledge and spiritel type powers and abilities. Giving it a edge of wonder and whats going to happen. The thing is the ending is too open, I SEEM TO JUST GET EVEN MORE ENTRESTING MORE POWER MORE SCI FI then it ended like whaaaa. This just left my mouth hanging looking for another cd. unfortunitly at this time they stoped making this series . Which most people son't understand it cost money to keep it going and with out a certain type from this fan and ratings it goes down the drain. MAYBE it was the advertising of this series or what not but who knows. IT HAS A twist with a girl being upsessed with the main charecter. unforinitly her sister is fine and the main charecter is more in to her because of her persenality and power. There really isn't even a strong plot of this anime every thing is more of a mystery. IT was a good beginning set up that could have been better but good enough to catch a little entrest. This ok anime but not the best so I gave it a mid star rating. arts great and it had some quiality of ideas.",1294099200,,1142,4.102678571428571
8211528,5,B000TZJBLA,This is a great anime for all adult anime fans.  Would not recommend this for children at all but is good for male anime enthusiast with the fan service and still good for females as well with butt kicking chics and more fan service.  The story line was awesome and the dubbing turned out to be good as well.  Comes in both English and Japanese with English subtitles so you can watch you anime in whichever format you prefer (I'm a fan of both and have been know to watch in both languages) I also enjoy watching it in english with the subtitles on to see how different the dialogue is.  Definitely recommended for the adult anime enthusiast to add to their collection!,1283558400,,670,4.4227642276422765
8211529,5,B000TZJBLA,"This is a good title to own if you enjoy fight scenes that aren't just a bunch of action lines. The characters are all over the top bad asses in their own regard making a fun, well rounded action show that keeps you on the edge while providing an abundant amount of fan service.",1262476800,,278,4.166666666666667
8211530,5,B000TZJBLA,"This is a great Animated, Box set. This is not for the young but older kids 13 and up will love it. Great fighting action and plot. Very pleased to add this to my collection.",1207785600,,174,4.0
8211531,5,B000TZJBLA,"There is a bit of anger among viewers regarding the utter failure of TT to have a satifying ending. Or ANY ending. I was there, I was in the same boat, right at the most climactic moment...nothing. Wtf!1

Geneon has since gone out of business; unless the lic goes to another co, thats it. Solution ? MANGA! Want to find out the end ? TT is really involved and continues! (not a del rey review, no comment on the sanitized vers.).

The anime is one of my faves still. Animation is crisp and with great colour, want a female voice to sound half-way normal ? TT. Deep involved story thats part Mystic, part Feudal Japan yet part now Japan ? TT.

TT is not perfect, the fan service is minimal imo, but after the first ep. I didn't really notice it; it can get a bit long in some spots and the ""flashbacks"" may cause some lack of focus, but over all the story and quality far out weigh and failures.

Do I wish TT had actually had a conclusion ? YES!. Do I think the manga had issues ? yes.

Do I regret finding TT ? NO.",1207267200,2,1015,4.106060606060606
8211532,5,B000TZJBLA,"Have you ever read Oh! Great mangas? They all possess a very unique air about them and you cannot describe it as 'fighting', or 'fanservice', or 'comedy', or 'school life' or label it with any other genre. It is all about it but from the stylish, sexual point point of view (no hentai though!).
Personaly, I prefer plot-tight, questioning anime which leaves your head full of thoughts. But once in a while anyone wants to see something juicy, eye-catching, impossible-to-turn-away because its so damn good looking. Tenjho Tenge is 100% from this league. It has so much blood-girls-boys-fights-fists to be almost overwhelming and unbearble, but it never crosses the final line and gets back to its gag-comedy side to settle things down for a bit.
And in the same time I cannot say it has no plot. Yes, it is close to its basics but here it is: there are groups of high schoolers who fight each other at Todo Academy's grounds which has been entirely dedicated to martial arts for more than 100 years. Familiar? But among all fight-them-all series I do not recall one where:
- so complicated characters relationships including love dreadful triangles, quadros, etc. exist;
- characters almost never cry, scream or crawl with pittiful faces (lets forget a girl with a broken heart, ok?);
- characters never say 20-minutes monologues with pathetic voices but fight, unrealisticly tough, but with clear reasoning, clear at least to themselves;
- even flashbacks about past (which are actually one of the two main storylines in the series) are so full of action and passion that to me the characters from 2 years back became more dear than the newly came cast.
And all of these is packed in such a wonderful character design, such juicy girls and macho boys than this modest hetero girl honestly felt bisexual influence from the visuals :-P
And by the end of the day, recalling the entire series I can tell that it had more emotional and mindful impact on me with all those really-hard-trying people than many so called clever shows whose heroes are boring scums.",1196899200,19,2057,4.830028328611898
8211533,4,B000TZJBLA,"This anime is quite good in the respects that it is action packed has a good premise and the characters all have a pretty good back story.  Sadly this is forgotten sometimes and replaced with fan service (panty shots, things of this sort).  All they ever really needed to do was focus on the action and character drama and this would have been a great anime.",1196380800,3,358,4.409090909090909
8211534,2,B000TZJBLA,"This series has some good moments, but the storytelling is lumpy (a seven episode flashback?) and the internal logic is really sloppy.
However, the deal breaker is that it doesn't end--it simply stops.  This is not an exaggeration.  When I got the the end of disk 8, I went to the box to get the next one...and there wasn't one.  It just...stops.  Right before the Big Climax.
Unacceptable!
Seriously, this is like going to a movie and having the last reel missing.  You can't win either way--either you like the series, in which case you'll feel robbed by the ""ending,"" or it's not something you'll like, in which case why buy it?
So I recommend you save your money until the alleged next series comes out to complete the story.  However, it's been a couple of years and so far no word on another series, so, as Dirty Harry would say: ""Do ya feel lucky?""",1193443200,34,855,4.483870967741935
