8207700,1,B000T4F4IK,I have seen a lot of very bad low-budget horror movies before but this might be the worst.  From the horrible inconsistencies to terrible props and acting it's hard to know where to begin.  I guess all I can say is that if you even have any desire what-so-ever to see this film suppress it. It's not worth the hour and ten minutes of your life.  I can only hope that the makers of this film decide to call it quits.  There isn't one thing in this movie that shows that they have any promise for the future.,1197504000,8,506,4.13265306122449
