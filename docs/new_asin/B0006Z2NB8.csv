8044026,1,B0006Z2NB8,"Really? The Italian Rashomon?  Please, no, don't insult a classic.  This is just a mess of a movie.  No class at all.  Always with the screaming and yelling in these Italian films of the late fifties and sixties.  The characters all idiots with beatific looks on their faces, and what faces, ugly to grotesque.  And what is it with this obsession with prostitutes in all the supposedly top Italian films of this era?  I guess it is that strict Roman Catholic upbringing.",1444867200,,470,4.658536585365853
8044027,5,B0006Z2NB8,"This 1962 black and white Italian film shows why some of the best films ever made were made in Italy from approximately 1945 to 1965.

The plot is basically a murder mystery which is used to show different facets of Italian life at that time.  This was when Italy was still recovering from World War II and was not the modern economy it is now.  The film concentrates on various marginal characters who do not hold a regular job.

A prostitute is killed at the edge of a park in Rome.  The police question various characters who were at the park at the time.  They all claim to have just been passing through the park.  Then long flashbacks show what really happened and the daily lives of these people.  Most of the film consists of these flashbacks.

The first is a young man who says he was in the park while looking for a job.  The flashback shows that the job was robbing people at the park.  The second is an ex-con who has now found a means of support as a gigolo.  The flashback shows that he is the gigolo of a madam whose demands for money owed by the prostitute forced her to look for work on that fateful night.  The third is a soldier on leave in Rome who fell asleep in the park.  The flashback shows he spent most of his time trying to pick up women.  The fourth is a teenager who was in the park with his friend looking for something to steal.  The fifth is a shady character who says he was in the park to kill time after work.  He works at a nightclub as a male dancer for unaccompanied women.

This movie is somewhat like the famous Japanese film Rashomon (1950) in that every witness tells a different story about the park, but different in that here the murder here is eventually solved.  It is also like the later British film Blow Up (1966), also directed by an Italian, where a photographer discovers evidence of a murder in a park when he enlarges a photograph he took there.  There the plot is used to show the new culture emerging in Britain where young people were abandoning the protestant work ethic and adopting hedonism.  Here the plot is used to show people struggling to survive on the edge of society.",1444608000,,2136,4.316582914572864
8044028,4,B0006Z2NB8,"Bertolucci, while a cinephile, had spent very little time on actual movie sets before making this film at age 21.

It's a Rashomon like exploration of the murder of a prostitute.  We see various men being questioned by police in a
stylized way - we never see the questioner, only the witness, sitting in a pool of harsh light.  We hear the man begin
to tell what he did or saw on the fateful day, while cutting to images of his actual experience, often at odds with what
we hear him telling the police.  By the end of the film we get a picture of what happened that night for each of these
men and the woman who was killed.  Beautifully photographed, with an excellent sense of composition, it's a pretty
strong little film.

There are weak spots; the acting is variable at best, in a few cases cringe-inducingly over the top.  Also, much of the
dialogue was evidently post recorded, so even though the actors are Italians speaking Italian, their mouths are sometimes
out of sync with their voices, and the dialogue often has a tinny artificial quality.

But quibbles aside, the film has a haunting quality that marks the start of a great film-maker's career, and makes this
well worth seeing.",1374796800,,1193,4.568075117370892
8044029,4,B0006Z2NB8,"Based on a script of Pier Paolo Passolini this film would be regarded as the Italian version of Rashomon. A Roman prostitute has been brutally murdered in a park near the Tiber River and in order to forward their investigation, the police corner a handful of people who were in the park at the time. As they separately tell their versions of why they were there and what they did, their narrations do not necessarily match the images on the screen that do reflect the truth.

But the film works out as one of the last brilliant gems of the Italian Neo-Realism. The miserable existence of this bunch of people, hopeless and terribly anguished who just live for the very moment with plans or illusions of a better life.

Although the movie is a mite dated, it works due its powerful message. Some edition cuts make impossible for me ti give it five stars.",1301097600,,853,4.532467532467533
8044030,5,B0006Z2NB8,"In the video interview he did for this criterion film release Bertolucci goes to some length on his collaboration with the great director Pier Paolo Pasolini - pointing to 'Accatone' as the birth of cinema. Then when speaking of his own work - he says that it was as if all his efforts were in vain - as the critics judged it as a copy of Pasolini. This judgement is very unfortunate - despite the fact that the story was written by Pasolini and the class of people to which it pertains is Pasolini's beloved lower class - this film has a radically different feeling from anything Pasolini ever did.

I am kind of a bit unsure as to whether this film rates 4 or 5 stars - certainly it is the work of a very young director and lacks the fine tuning of later Bertolucci films. Nevertheless, this film hangs with me like a strange dream and it has proven itself worthy of an excellent rating.",1108512000,6,889,4.323353293413174
8044031,4,B0006Z2NB8,"Death suggests the ultimate end for an individual and it often travels together with fear stemming from awareness of the unknown destination after the heart ceases to beat.  The destination after death has been taught by religious leaders for several millennia and frequently the tales after death include those of devils, demons, and other scary creatures that embed fear in the listeners.  Tales told in regards to life after death reveal, as many religious leaders have suggested, that the destination is based on the choices made while alive.  Thus, these choices better have a moral direction where the person abides to the rules of the society, or consequences might be dire when the heart halts.  However, when death arrives to a poor soul those who live must deal with the remains of the deceased, which heavily will affect the destination thereafter.

Bernardo Bertolucci's tale La Commare Secca opens with the camera in a tilted lower angle on a bridge while the sound of a car swooshes by, as some pages are thrown over the edge of the bridge.  The camera pans with the pages that drift with the wind, which gives the audience a good view of the Tiber river and the apartment complexes across the river.  Increasingly the wind speeds up the movement of the falling pages as they blow along the man-made river bank.  The pages appear to be newspaper pages as they get stuck in the high grass.  Some pages struggle to get free from the grass as the wind keeps tearing at them.  Slowly the panning camera moves out of focus and then back into focus as it's attention is aimed at the drifting pages.  Suddenly the camera stops it's panning motion, and playfully soothing music appears in the background.  The camera has discovered a body, a dead body of a woman laying face down in the grass as the pages drift over her body.  The camera zooms out and gives the audience another view of the river while keeping the body of the woman in the lower right corner of the framed image, which is followed by the title.

The story that Bertolucci depicts is based on a story by the late artist, philosopher, and filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini, and he gives the story an honest portrayal.  Brilliantly Bertolucci begins with the audience discovering the body, not a character in the story, but through the camera the audience is making a macabre discovery of what seems to be a murder.  Newspaper pages give the bizarre discovery a true, yet grotesque analogy of the situation, as the dead woman is not the only story, but her story is surrounded by numerous similar stories.  Yet, the dead woman's story manifests itself through the presence of her body.

An investigations follows the discovery of the dead woman, as the police begin to question suspects for information that could lead to the capture of the murderer.  The interrogations of the suspects are filmed in the perspective of the audience, as if the viewer were the cross-examiner or present in the room.  Several suspects are brought in for questioning such as a young unemployed man, a freeloader, a soldier, a drifter, and two teenagers.  In the cross-examination the suspects are asked who they are, how old they are, where they come from, where were they before they ended up in the vicinity of the murder, and why they were at the area of the murder.  Each person gives a detailed description after they are more or less cooperative with the police.  The narrative accounts from the suspects are displayed as flashbacks to the audience, as the audience is allowed to make their own judgment based on the accounts.

The suspects all are given the opportunity tell their story, but they are never free from suspicion from the audience or the police.  Being in the wrong place at the wrong time has burdened all suspects with an internal fear of merely being under suspicion, as they are all aware of the seriousness of the situation.  There is also more fundamental power at work, the power of moral enlightenment provided by a catholic upbringing.  In some it is more evident than others, as some of the suspects have a dubious background and former experiences with law enforcement.  In addition, the suspects know all too well that being in a park at night is often connected with some immoral or indecent act.  The stories within the story give the audience several insightful perceptions of the 1960s Italian lifestyle and culture and also on human interaction.  This enhances character development in the film, which is essential as it will eventually lead to how the audience perceives each character -- guilty or not.

La Commare Secca was Bertolucci's first feature which he framed poetically as each scene provides more than what meets the eye.  This visual poetry, which could be seen in the opening scene offered the world great promise of his talent.  He later made films such as Il Conformista (1970), 1900 (1976), and Sheltering Sky (1990), which are all wonderful films.  The organization of the flashbacks in La Commare Secca brings a vivid visual expression of the story in it's entirety, as the characters avoid everything connected with the bestial act.  This is thanks to Bertolucci's understanding of human behavior in Italian culture, which is heavily influenced by the Catholic Church and family.  In addition, the film has strong influences of Pasolini, which was desired by the producer.  Ultimately, Bertolucci leaves the world with a cinematic experience that is visually stunning and brave, as it will leave the viewers thinking for some time.",1107648000,13,5537,4.852127659574468
