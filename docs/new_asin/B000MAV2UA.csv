I haven't consistently done pilates, but when i did for the first three months i purchased the set i saw an amazing difference. The ab workout especially flattens the lower half of your abs. THe bun and thigh work out really gets buns and thighs into shape. I got the most remarks from friends about how small my legs became, and quickly. I reccomend starting with the 20 minute workout, a nd once that becomes easy, i focused on rotating the upper body, abs and buns dvds for optimal use of time. I want to say that i am not an athlete, and never have been, but i found winsor pilates to be a great workout for me. I  reccomend winsor pilates and not just any old pilates program, i've tried other programs and did not like them near as much. on top of doing pilates you also need to do cardio to get the outcome you want. Pilates does improve posture, strength, and flexibility. mari winsor does a great job of showing you alternative forms of doing exercises if you have a weak back or other issues.",1176854400,5,1058,4.316582914572864
