8127919,5,B000FZETXY,These shorts are just about the cutest thing you'll see regarding Paddington. My family enjoys them far more than the movie. It's a combination of stop motion and illustrations. The stories are read by Michael Hordern with a quintessential British flair that any Anglophile will enjoy endlessly. We liked it so much we bought the full collection on DVD.,1466640000,,353,5.0

8127926,5,B000FZETXY,"If you love Paddington Bear, you will love these highly stylized videos.  Paddington is portrayed by a stop-action plush bear.  Everyone else is a paper cutout against a paper background.  The videos are very British and very Paddington!",1427846400,,237,5.184210526315789
