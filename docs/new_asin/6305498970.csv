Lesson learned.",1397952000,,207,4.621621621621622
7890277,2,6305498970,I wished that they relased a complete series dvd for Zoom. It was off air six years ago and that they have had reruns of this show again after a cancellation of six and a half years.,1363132800,,182,3.945945945945946
7890278,3,6305498970,I'm looking for the answer to the riddle of Fanny DooLittle. Does anyone know if any of the ZOOM productions available for purchase gives that info (or are you willing to share her secret)?,1214006400,,189,4.588235294117647
7890279,5,6305498970,"My 2 year old daughter really enjoys watching Zoom on PBS, so this video was an instant hit. The pace moves quickly enough to hold the viewer's attention, and there are plenty of silly goofs and interesting behind the scenes footage. For example, the Zoomers have a room to spend time in while they're not on set, where they can practice their segments. They also find time to be silly there, such as building tall towers with bean bag chairs, and performing to the Spice Girls. Our favorite part of this video is the bloopers section, as it's comical to see how the Zoomers react when they make a mistake. I highly recommend this video.",1067558400,,637,4.547826086956522
7890280,5,6305498970,"This video The ZOOMers Video Special: The Making Of ZOOM is great. It's the video that goes behind the sences that the Season 1 ZOOM Cast do like rehersals, mistakes, auditions, making the opening and where they hang out when they are not on set. The you won't you that when you watch ZOOM on PBS. Jared From the 1st Season & Zoe from the 1st & 2nd Season host this video did a good job telling all about the show and and the story that how if you want to become a cast member on ZOOM. I hope this PBS Kid's TV Show plans to release this on DVD and also release the PBS Kid's ZOOM Video that's Party With ZOOM and also release like another another ZOOM like a special episode from one the seasons on Video & DVD.",1030752000,,712,4.056737588652482
7890281,5,6305498970,"Engaging and inspirational for those interested in TV production, this video generates interest in the arts. Science activities are age-appropriate. It shows how we learn from our mistakes and provides good role models for working together. Kids were enthusiastic. They loved the ""ubba dubba"" language. ""The bloopers were so funny.""  ""It made me want to sing with them."" ""My friends will like this."" ""It was neat watching them learn to dance."" ""Everyone was friendly."" Best for ages 5 to 8.",1001030400,,490,5.125
7890282,5,6305498970,"Our 4 year old loves the ZOOM series.  She would watch it every day if we would allow her.
We received this video as a gift; I think we watched it 8 times over one weekend.
If you love ZOOM, you will appreciate the humor, the outtakes, scenes from auditions, and the behind the scenes  activity of the cast and crew.  My daughter loved the Escape from ZOOM  sequence, too.  I don't know whether you would love the video so much, if  you didn't already know ZOOM and its method.  We shared the outtakes with a  friend and she thought that that part, at least, was hilarious.
Buy  this video!",946512000,2,590,4.290909090909091
