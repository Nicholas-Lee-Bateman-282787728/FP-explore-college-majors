6337701,2,B00J5LXPPM,"The final episode just aired and they're already posting the fourth season for sale. If you enjoyed it I guess that'd be a great thing, something I wish more TV shows would do. However, it seems like the network took notice of its commercial failure compared to the previous seasons and wants to sell their stock as quickly as possible.  If you're a Boondocks fan more than likely you've watched the fourth season. If you haven't then I recommend skipping it. Yes the first three seasons were all incredible and memorable, but the fourth leaves a sour taste.

When I learned series creator Aaron McGruder would not be apart of the fourth season I was hoping it wouldn't show. Sadly that is not the case. After such a long hiatus you'd think they'd bring back some of the most memorable characters, yet the entire season seemed to focus solely on Grandad and a Uncle Ruckus. Leaving the true stars, Huey and Riley to appear as background characters. It's unfortunate to see a cartoon, amongst the best to come out in the last decade, hit such a rough patch that I'm not sure it will recover from.

If you have yet to see the Boondocks at all, I recommend watching the first three seasons and leaving it at that. The fourth was signifigantly less enjoyable than the first three. Though you'll get a few laughs here and there, ultimately its forgettable and you'd be better off leaving your memory of The Boondocks at the end of the third season.",1403568000,56,1443,4.5852713178294575
6337702,2,B00J5LXPPM,"For those who don't know, Aaron Mcgruder was not apart of this season of The Boondocks and it most definitely showed. Most of this season literally revolves solely on Grandad, and the first episode kicks in with Tom, then Uncle Ruckus. Huey and Riley seem almost only as extras. There's some humor that will have you giggle for only good once-over episodes, but no material that you would want as a DVD set to re-watch again. Save your money and watch the episodes on AdultSwim or torrents.

** Also most of our beloved characters are no longer present: Ed Wuncler III, Gin Rummy, A Pimp Named Slickback, Gangstalicious, Thugnificent and his whole crew.",1403568000,102,653,4.778761061946903

The fourth season had three problems, one, it took waaaay too long for this season to happen. Two, only ten episode instead of fifteen like the other three seasons and three, Aaron McGruder had nothing to do with this season and it shows. The artwork is still there but the writing was all over the place. The first episode was about Tom DuBois and his wife. Episode two had the Freemans broke. Episodes three and four was a Breaking Bad parody. The fifth episode had Granddad telling a Freedom Riders story. Six had a fake Kardashian, in seven, they were working of a debt at a slavery-amusement park. Episodes eight, nine and ten were the best of the season. At least it ended on a high note.",1504483200,,799,4.594405594405594

It even had a what if episode of Martin Luther King and what he thought of today's ways people acted.  The DVD collections of the seasons were even better because they allowed uncensored words and brief nudity.  I'm glad there aren't too many F-Bombs.

It's like a sad attempt to save a sinking ship with an overuse of the N word, cheap shots to stay relevant i.e the Kardashian episode, and the Siri episode, and poor excuses for satire. The loss of Aaron McGruder turned this show so far into the iceberg to the fact that it's heart breaking. I would advise ANYONE not to waste their money.",1444953600,,538,4.336633663366337
6337738,1,B00J5LXPPM,"The Boondocks was always one of my favorite shows on Adult Swim's programming block. It was smart, thought-provoking, and most of all hysterically funny! When I heard they were finally making a fourth and final season after a long hiatus, I couldn't wait! Despite series creator Aaron McGruder not being involved with this season, I still had faith this season would be good. Well, I hate to admit it, but I was dead wrong!

It feels like the writers this season took some early drafts for episodes that had been sitting on the shelf for a few years instead of coming up with new ideas. The social topics skewered in this season such as Chris Brown and Siri are non-relevant and have already been parodied (and much better) in other shows. Well, even if the content is outdated, the humor as still got to be good right? Wrong! The humor this season is too predictable and weak going for the easiest targets. Even the characters don't seem themselves and appear to have become self-parodies of what we once known.

It's sad to see a once great show go out on such a weak note. Not only is this a bad season, but it feels like it goes against everything the show is suppose to be as well. My advice is to stick to the first 3 seasons and forget that this one exists.",1444780800,4,1264,4.420600858369099

There are a few cheap moments, but the overall writing is horrible due to such high standard being set by season 1-3.  It is so obvious the original writers are not involved.  I would say another season or movie needs to be made to redeem this trash, but the problem is so many people would be hurt if the same product was presented if not worst.

With McGruder absent for this season, The Boondock's political humor as well as any humor to be honest, is absent as well. This season is just all about Grandpa Freeman in debt and screwing up, nothing fun, nothing really engaging. To see how me and a couple of friends who used to watch the show years ago, religiously and against our parents will, and binge watched S1-S3 as adults now have completely disregarded and given up on watching this season past episode 3 or 4 says something.
McGruder's direction would always give the show not just something to laugh about, but to also think deeply about our current racial situations in this country and put both sides of the coin at fault, especially in the extremely controversial MLK episode. It was humor and a human philosophy question.
So we've waited years for a S4, I'm talking 4 good years and in return we pretty shod disappointment, left wing trumpeting, old men running without their pants, and oh yeah, I can't find Huey and Riley most anywhere.

I had to see it to believe it for myself, and maybe you will too.  This season lacks everything.  Each episode lacks any fluidity and we are occasionally reminded that in the beginning of the season Grandad sold the family into slavery to Ed Wuncler II (not the first, or the third, but a new character we are expected to accept as someone who's been around since the beginning) because he is broke and blindly signs any contract thrown in front of him.

6337805,1,B00J5LXPPM,"For those who may not have heard, Season 4 was made w/o the show's creator Aaron McGruder and it shows.  You can sum this season up in 5 words... ""The show lost its wit"".

Whoever wrote season 4 clearly did not fully grasp the show's satire.  They go for cheap laughs with Grandad and Riley, only the laughs never come.  They completely lost sight of the fact that Huey is the show's protagonist and even when he's not the central focus of an episode, his perspective on the exploits around him are what made the show work. Without it, Season 4 devolves the Boondocks into dumb amalgamation of stereotypes and borderline offensive parodies that fall flat far too often.

They even managed to totally miss the mark on Uncle Ruckus.  In season 4, Uncle Rukus just spews ridiculously racist comments only w/o the subtle hints of truth that made them funny in earlier seasons. For fans new and old, I highly recommend seasons 1-3, but do yourself a favor and skip season 4.",1408579200,5,969,4.572254335260116

6337821,5,B00J5LXPPM,"THIS HAS TO BE ONE OF THE BEST BOONDOCK SERIES TO COME OUT. ""I LOVE FREEDOM RIDE OR DIE"" BECAUSE IT SHOWS HOW STUPID THE NON VIOLENT MOVEMENT WAS TRYING TO BEG FOR A SEAT AT THE TABLE OF WHITE RACISTS. & IF YOU REALLY LOOK AT IT INTERGRATION WAS THE WORST THING TO HAPPEN TO BLACKS BECAUSE IT MADE THEM EASIER TO CONTROL BY THE WHITE ELITE WITH NO DESIRE TO HAVE BLACK ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE LIKE WE ONCE HAD BEFORE INTERGRATION. JUST CHECKOUT ROSEWOOD, THE TULSA LYNCHINGS(BLACK WALL ST.), & THE LESSONS OF HAYTI DOCUMENTARY. THOSE WERE GREAT EXAMPLES OF BLACK ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE BEFORE THEY WERE EVENTUALLY DESTROYED BY WHITE RACISM BACK IN THE DAY. & THE ONLY REASON WHITES SIDED WITH THAT LAME NON VIOLENT MOVEMENT WAS BECAUSE THEY FEARED BLACKS EVENTUALLY FOLLOWING MALCOLM X. & WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT MALCOLM X, THE DEACONS OF DEFENSE, & THE PANTHER PARTY WERE MORE OF A THREAT BECAUSE THEY TAUGHT SELF DEFENSE & SELF RELIANCE. I ALSO LIKED ""PRETTY BOY FLIZZY"" BECAUSE IT SHOWS HOW IGNORANT BLACK HIP HOP & R&B HAS BECOME. ""BREAKING GRANDDAD"" WAS A GREAT SHOW BECAUSE IT SHOWS HOW MOST BLACK AMERICAN FEMALES WILL GO TO EXTREME LENGTHS TO DESTROY THEIR BEAUTIFUL NATURAL HAIR FOR IT TO BE STRAIGHT. ""GRANDDAD DATES A KARDASHIAN"" SHOWS HOW LAME ALL THESE REALITY SHOWS ARE. & LAST BUT NOT LEAST FREEDOMLAND WAS GREAT BECAUSE IT SUBLIMINALLY SHOWS HOW HOLLYWOOD MOSTLY LIKES TO DEPICT BLACKS AS SLAVES.

I WATCH THIS GREAT SERIES OVER & OVER. & FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO GAVE THIS SERIES BAD REVIEWS IS BECAUSE IT'S MOSTLY TALKING ABOUT HOW CHEESY AND LAME TODAY'S GENERATION HAS BECOME & HOW THE CIVIL RIGHTS INTERGRATIONIST MOVEMENT DIDN'T DO A THING TO ELEVATE BLACK STATUS JUST OPEN YOUR DOOR & YOU'LL KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT OR JUST TURN ON YOUR TELEVISION & RADIO & YOU'LL SEE HOW BACKWARDS BLACKS HAVE BECOME.

6337822,5,B00J5LXPPM,I don't know what's wrong with you people. I LOVED the newest season and I'm hoping they make a 5th!!,1405728000,,101,4.1
6337823,3,B00J5LXPPM,"For many of you who understand the `GT' reference that I used in the title of this review - good for you.  For those of you who don't...go watch the complete anime collections of `Dragonball' and `Dragonball Z' and you'll see what I meant when I compared `Dragonball GT' to `The Boondocks: Season 4.'

Aaron McGruder - where the heck were you at, man!?

Yes, they kept the original voices.  Yes, the animation stayed the same.  The tonality of the final work, though?  Meh.  When ""Pretty Boy Flizzy"" first came on as the first episode of Season 4, I thought to myself ""hmm...this is kinda...I don't know.""  After seeing the remaining nine episodes, I can see why Mr. McGruder said ""I'm not representing this anymore,"" and just left the show.  Unfortunately, when he left the show, he wasn't there to represent his property anymore, and that led to a sharp decline in the quality of this once great show.

For shame.

For those of you (like myself) who are `Boondocks' purists, you'll need to buy this season to complete your collection (which sucks, cause this season wasn't needed after you get past the excitement that they created another season - plus you have to spend close to $30 just to get it).  If any of you haven't seen this yet - real talk - you're not missing much.  So when I compare this season to `DBGT,' there's validity in that comparison.  Either you're going to like it like some liked `GT,' or you're going to see it as most people see saw `GT': this season didn't involve the creator of the property, so all of it was just a means to an end...in retrospect, this season was just a way for the producers of the show to get money on this brand since it remained popular after the last season - which is really sad, because they just put a bad taste in the mouths of potentially new viewers of this series who never saw the last seasons of this show.

Oh well...farewell Huey, Riley, Grandpa (and the others) - you will be missed (based off of Season 3's version).",1405728000,,1984,4.472222222222222
6337824,1,B00J5LXPPM,"Not since the fifth season of the Simpsons has such a travesty been foisted upon the public. Thankfully, no one whom I respect was fooled.

From the first few minutes of ""Pretty Boy Flizzy"" onward, it appears that the characters have been co-opted by the forces for corporatist, feel-good, racial and socioeconomic stratification. Uncle Ruckus  and Robert Freeman are handed most of the screen time, Riley is reduced to a sitcom character, and Huey appears to have been replaced by a smooth-talking sound-alike stunt-double with half the morals & absolutely _none_ of the real version's sense of honour. In other words, what we have here is a sort of 'Boondocks Lite', streamlined to remind audience members of what they need to think, and drained of subversiveness accordingly. But without the anarchism (may one kindly remind the producer and network that Huey is supposed to be a domestic terrorist?), there really is no Boondocks.

I read from creator Aaron McGruder's statement that there was no way he was going to be associated with the network's latest output involving the offspring of his imagination. I read from the network's press release that they have absolutely no clue as to what actually made the show work. I even have found attempts by certain associates of either of the parties to throw in their two cents as 'friends' of McGruder (shades of Dave Chappelle, anyone? Perhaps another reminder to those currently involved with the 'intellectual property' of the Boondocks -that McGruder is an artist and a gentleman, and that they are neither- is now in order?).

'Final season' designation notwithstanding, I predict that they will be able to milk this for at least another couple of years before the rest of the audience wakes up.

Despite this obvious silencing of yet another voice of dissent at a time when it is needed most, I refuse to be angry, knowing full well that McGruder's spiritual successor is out there carrying the fire somehow. May we all follow the admonition of McGruder in his aforementioned comment and, as he quoted, ""hold no grudges"".

Avoid this poorly-paced shark-jumping cash grab at all costs.",1405296000,24,2141,5.0

6337826,2,B00J5LXPPM,This season of The Boondocks was unnecessary. The jokes seemed forced and not that funny. I will say two episodes were down right funny in my opinion. (I dream of Siri and The New Black). The prior 3 season had 15 episodes while this rushed season only had 10. The only reason I purchased this season was to complete my collection.,1404777600,5,331,4.442622950819672
6337827,1,B00J5LXPPM,"The third season of The ""Boondocks"" ended with a good, weird parody of ""24,"" mirroring some of the themes of the pilot episode but adding more explosions. Beautiful! Series concluded. Roll credits.

Unfortunately for all of humanity, ""The Boondocks"" was resurrected nearly four years later with no themes, few ideas, and a sort of amnesia about why the show even existed. Creator Aaron McGruder, who was always a little prickly, bailed during production, and a skeleton crew salvaged 10 episodes from the wreckage. You will wish they didn't. With the partial exception of ""Freedom Ride or Die,"" a flashback episode about Grandad's accidental Civil Rights heroism, these stories are witless and irrelevant.

Where to start with this mess? At least half of it rewrites -- badly -- solid previous episodes. Stinkmeaner is cloned and set up to fight Grandad in a boring parody of the character's first appearance. Grandad buys a phone with Siri, and learns that even computers can be dominating, crazy women. He dates a fake Kardashian sister and learns the same thing. He becomes a gigolo and --  ha, ha are you laughing yet? An on-again off-again plot has the family going bankrupt and being sold into a slavery theme park. It's painful to think of what a better creative team might have done with that joke. This one created a boring Very Special Episode, one of several that over-use Uncle Ruckus.

This set is a public health hazard that must be avoided at all costs. If you liked the show, pretend that it ended with season 3.",1404691200,27,1528,4.842911877394636

And my discontent was CONFIRMED from the very first episode in this failure of a 4th season.  They should NOT have done a 4th season without McGruder...this season made it PAINFULLY apparent that they needed McGruder's input & should NOT have moved forward without him.  McGruder is the creative genius & anchor of this show. This is the season that should NOT have been. If McGruder never returns to this (which I hope he does), well then we can only be content with the first three seasons.
