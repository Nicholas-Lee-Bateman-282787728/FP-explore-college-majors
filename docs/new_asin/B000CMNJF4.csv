2465462,5,B000CMNJF4,"I don't want to waste your time by reiterating what everyone else has said so eloquently.  I adore this film.

What I am frustrated by is the inability to find the soundtrack or even the individual songs somewhere on Amazon.  The haunting ""Jubilee"" by Alison Krauss is nowhere to be found!  I hope they will consider putting that out so we can enjoy the music of this beautiful documentary...",1146873600,4,392,4.63768115942029
2465463,5,B000CMNJF4,"I just saw this movie tonight at college in remembrance of the Holocaust victims in the ""spirit"" of Yom Hashoa.  I found this one of the most moving documentaries of my entire life.  As Anne Frank said, ""I really do believe people are good at heart.""  This statement exemplifies this small middle school's, and the whole Whitwill community's, Paper Clip Holocaust Memorial project.  I recommend this movie to every and all people.",1146009600,4,430,4.930555555555555
2465464,4,B000CMNJF4,"This was a great documentary that demonstrates many of the great things about education in the world.  As a teacher, I was very pleased to see the outstanding results that came from incorporating many different subjects when studying one topic, letting students have some control and run with an idea, and getting students learn by having a personal investment in a topic.  By watching this movie, you are taken along the journey of a rural Tennessee's attempt to understand the Holocaust after a student wondered how many 6 million really was.  This question prompted the students to attempt to collect 6 million paperclips representing the Jews killed by the Nazis.  A school project gained national attention, but more importantly helped a school and a community learn something lasting about the Holocaust and the bigger picture of intolerance, hatred, and how words have the power to inspire attitudes and actions.  My only complaint about the documentary was that I would liked to have heard more of the thoughts from students and seen less of the logistical side, although a handful of students did offer some testimony.  Overall, it was a fabulous demonstration of the power school can have and the lasting lessons that can be taught.",1145232000,6,1242,5.034146341463415
2465465,5,B000CMNJF4,This documentary is a testiment to the positive power that can be created when ordinary people unite and work towards a common goal.  In an era where the Holocaust is being denied by some and forgotten by others Paper Clips is an incredible tribute to the human spirit that will move you to tears and make you want to share it with everyone you know.,1144800000,5,350,4.384615384615385
2465466,5,B000CMNJF4,"Within days after watching Schindler's List (again) with my son for a high school humanities class, my sister suggestted I watch this extraordinary film. I cannot recommend Paper Clips highly enough.  Not merely informative, it was extraordinary enjoyable - for myself (a high school teacher), my wife (an elementary school teacher) as well as my 16 yo son. The dedication of this little southern community could serve as examplars love, committment, and dedication to the entire country, indeed the world. As we read and see the daily tragedies in our world unfold on our screens, we need to see events like this to remind us of Anne Frank's words and her belief that people are inherently good.

Extraordinary and very special! After viewing the rental, I purchased it on amazon for reviewing whenever I might need a reminder. Personally, I feel an obligation to visit this little town at some point in my life to honor their work, and accomplishment.",1144368000,7,953,4.95
2465467,5,B000CMNJF4,"In 1998, the students at Whitwell Middle School in rural Tennessee embarked on a project under the direction of their principal, Linda Hooper, assistant principal and history teacher, David Smith, and language arts teacher, Sandra Roberts.  The goal was to demonstrate to these almost uniformly white and Christian children the tragic consequences of hatred and intolerance.  When a student heard that the Nazis murdered six million Jews during World War II, he said that such a large number is incomprehensible.  So the children did some research, found out that a Norwegian invented the paper clip, and that Norwegians wore paper clips on their lapels as a symbol of resistance to the Nazis during World War II.  The kids started writing letters asking for donations of paper clips, hoping to collect eleven million clips, one for each victim of the Nazi regime.  What started as a local project became international in scope.  The students received letters from all over the world expressing support for the project.  Holocaust survivors and their children, as well as a former solider who helped liberate a concentration camp, also sent letters with heart-rending anecdotes.  This documentary film is a moving chronicle of the paper clip project.

Directed by Elliot Berlin and Joe Fab and written by Joe Fab, ""Paper Clips"" is a poignant tribute to the educators at Whitwell and to the children who enthusiastically immersed themselves in the history of the Holocaust.  The film includes footage not only of the teachers and their students, but also of the former concentrate camp inmates who recount painful memories of their experiences.  Two other key figures in the film are Peter Schroeder and his wife, Dagmar Schroeder-Hildebrand, journalists who visited Whitwell.  The couple was impressed not only with the project, but also with the warmth of the residents of this small Tennessee town. Peter and Dagmar, who o did a great deal to publicize the project, speak on camera along with the principal, teachers, and students of Whitwell.  The residents of the community explain how the paper clip project transformed them.  Practically everyone in Whitwell became involved in one way or another before the project finally reached fruition.

On November 9, 2001, the anniversary of Kristallnacht, a memorial railcar that had been used in Nazi Germany to transport Jews to their deaths was dedicated in Whitwell.  It is filled with eleven million paper clips and serves as a learning center for visiting students.  ""Paper Clips"" is a simple film that exudes warmth and compassion.  I recommend this documentary for children from the ages of ten or eleven through high school.  It would be useful in raising awareness of the Holocaust and in imparting the idea that every one of us has the power to bring about positive change in the world.",1139097600,35,2845,5.105831533477322
2465468,5,B000CMNJF4,"There have been very few movies that have moved me to tears and this one has topped the list.  If you have any preconcieved ideas about this film before you watch it, just forget them.  This film is totally unique and has no comparison to anything ever done on this subject before.  When it's released for sale to the general public, you can be sure I will purchase it to show my friends who had missed it while playing in the theaters.

I know this review has told you next to nothing about this movie and it was intended that way to help spur you on to seeing it for your self and I hopoe you will.",1137542400,18,600,4.102564102564102
2465469,5,B000CMNJF4,"This is the most beautiful and touching documentary I have ever watched.  It is absolutely amazing to watch these young kids become enlightened on so many levels.  What is most incredible is how profoundly it touched me watching these students learn the basic fact that we are all one on this huge planet.  We all have the same fears, same hopes, same struggles.  This film shows the impact that this project had on others who were involved, eventually leading to a worldwide response. If we as adults would take the time to learn the same lessons in life that these young folks learned our world would be so much more than what it is today. This is simply a documentary that should not be missed.",1136419200,14,697,4.552
2465470,5,B000CMNJF4,"There is a terrific DVD which poignantly describes how a rural Tennessee Middle School engages in a project to instill a sense of diversity by teaching kids about the Holocaust. They never expected to affect so much of the life of the town, gain such a deep appreciation of the lives affected and the international involvement they earned. The lesson learned was the need to fight indifference and intolerance. A beautiful scene was the admission by a couple of Washington Post reporters that they had to get past their own deeply seated prejudices against rural southerners and discovering the love that filled their souls.

Enjoy this wonderful story.",1134777600,40,653,5.046296296296297

2465480,5,B000CMNJF4,"This biography of the kids Paper Clip project from Whitwell, TN is incredible. It shows the power of children and what they can achieve while also focusing on the idea that all people no matter who they are, what they look like or believe in, or where they come from are special and beautiful and important. There are so many ways to talk about segregation, the holocaust, and other traumatizing moments in history, but this one focuses on the positive changes that should and are being made.

2465490,5,B000CMNJF4,"An excellent, inspiring, educational film- particularly a must see for those living in the Southeaster portion of the U.S. This movie is about the choice to evolve out of old hatreds and prejudices. It's about educating ourselves and our children, with history, rather than blindly accepting folktales, lies and ignorance. It's about opening our minds and hearts to additional information.. choosing to learn how to make the world a better place.",1485734400,2,446,5.295774647887324

2465499,5,B000CMNJF4,"This is an amazing kid-friendly documentary about the horrific events surrounding the holocaust (without the horrifying images). I teach middle-school-aged children, and I use this movie to reinforce content they learn in class. While the video is playing, you can hear a pin drop in the classroom. All who watch cannot help but remain engaged, especially when the holocaust survivors share their stories. This film has everything you need to explain the holocaust in a subtle, non-graphic, and sensitive way.",1481760000,2,509,5.375

2465504,5,B000CMNJF4,I used this documentary during my Propaganda/Holocaust unit with 8th grade gifted students.  I love the visual aspect this middle school created with the paperclips and the way the whole town invested so much heart into the project.,1477526400,,232,5.105263157894737
2465505,5,B000CMNJF4,We etched this documentary years ago. We purchased this last night because we were taking our children to see the actual car and Paperclips.  Our children range in ages between 15-5. All four kids took something meaningful away from the documentary and applied it to our day trip to Whitwell.  Even if you can't go to see this in person the meaning is not lost.,1475625600,,361,4.538461538461538

2465512,4,B000CMNJF4,This documentary was moving and touching.  I was using it as an educational video for a unit on World War 2. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because the documentary was dragged out probably 30 minutes longer than necessary. I think it would have/could have made a better point to my students had it been a bit tighter.,1468022400,,317,4.283333333333333
2465513,5,B000CMNJF4,I cried through this entire documentary. It is a touching story about a rural Tennessee middle school where the students have a unique way of learning about the Holocaust.

2465514,5,B000CMNJF4,"This is an excellent documentary. I would love to see a sequel where a group of Jewish students get together with the students from the movie, or students of the same age range.

It's god on so many levels.  First and foremost it's a great story that you want to hear.  Will they get enough paper clips?  Will they get the train car?  What difference will it make if they do?  First rate story telling.

The educational part of the story is not to be missed.  Understanding that people died in concentration camps is one thing but grasping the magnitude is something we fail to grasp.  Seeing the number of paperclips and realizing that each one represents a life cut short emphasizes bridges learning with emotion and that is the kind of learning that lasts.

Finally there is a lesson for all of us about how intolerance and un-acceptance leads to grave consequences and horror.  Something I think about each election year.",1461715200,,914,4.574074074074074

2465533,5,B000CMNJF4,it was beyond my expectations. The children in my 7th grade religion clss were very emotional as they watched it. We also began wearing paper clips not just for the Holocast victims but also for all that goes on in our world today. We realized that it has not stopped.,1458432000,,268,4.38
2465534,2,B000CMNJF4,"I love the project and the outcome, for the most part. The movie was made over a decade ago, so it feels a little dated. The message of the movie is valuable, but whoa is this a heavy-handed display of emotional pandering. The music, the repeated sentiments, the slow takes on people tearing up...I felt like it went on forever. I love the outcome but was surprised by the lack of diversity in the school tours of the display. The area most certainly has people of color but we don't see it reflected in the tour groups the film makers ended up highlighting.",1458000000,,558,4.427184466019417

HOWEVER, if you accidentally (or without being aware of the ramifications) click on the ""BUY MOVIE"" in the SD format, you will discover that you have immediately BOUGHT the movie. You seemingly can't cancel the order because you are told that you have already started viewing or downloading the movie.  At least that was my experience.  I have no use for a movie that has to be viewed on a computer (from digital storage or on-line streaming).

2465588,5,B000CMNJF4,"I have seen this documentary many times, and it never fails to move me each time I watch it. As a child, I remember seeing one of my family members roll up her sleeve and show me the black numbers tattooed on the inside of her forearm. I was four years old, and she passed away shortly after that. To this day, I can't remember what her face looked like, but I can still see the bold black numbers stacked on her arm as plain as day. This is a part of my family history that I never intend to forget. Watching this documentary made me realize how events like the Holocaust can move people, and motivate them to make positive change. I think the children of Whitwell Middle School showed a compassion far beyond their years. This movie was so well documented, and I was touched through each stage of the project. What a fabulous legacy this group of students has given to the people in their town, and what a fabulous gift they have given to others throughout the world. I am buying this movie as a gift for my friend's son who is reading a book on the Holocaust for one of his classes. My friend told me that while his son has been reading the book, he constantly asks him how something like the Holocaust could ever have been possible. I wholeheartedly agree. I think this documentary will show him that even though there are people in this world with a huge capacity for cruelty, there are others out there with a huge capacity for compassion and positive change.

The project started when teachers came up with the idea of helping students from a small town get an idea of the magnitude of the number 6 million - the Jews killed in Hitler's Holocaust as a result of nothing but unreasoning hatred -- by having the students try to collect 6 million paperclips.  Students wrote letters asking for paperclips (and explaining the project)  to businesses, newspapers, and friends and relatives all over the country.  When the story was  picked up by a reporter, it gained international exposure and students began to receive paperclips from all over the world, including many from Holocaust survivors who included personal letters and paperclips to represent their own family members lost to the Shoah.

2465640,5,B000CMNJF4,"This basic documentary is shot simply and full of talking heads, and loaded with an often
over-the-top score... and it doesn't matter a bit.

This is the deeply moving story of how a tiny Southern U.S. town of 1600 people, a town with no
Catholics, let alone Jews, decided to teach their middle school students about tolerance and
diversity by teaching them about the Holocaust. The program caught on and deeply affected the
students, who came up with the idea of collecting 6 million papers clips as a way of honoring the
memory of the 6 million Jews who died under Hitler.

The program attracted attention first across the country and then from around the world as Presidents
and movie stars sent paper clips, and Holocaust survivors traveled to the town to meet the students, and were
greeted with tremendous showings of love and respect.

Eventually this tiny town created a permanent and impressive memorial to not only the 6 million Jews who
perished, but also the 5 million gay people, gypsies, mentally and physically handicapped and others killed
in the death camps. I found it impossible not to cry, and to really deeply touched by the good in these small
town folk, making me realize my own prejudices in my assumptions that small town southerners would be
closed minded to the sufferings of those not like them.  That's to my shame, and another powerful lesson for
this film to teach.

2465644,5,B000CMNJF4,"This documentary about students from a small, southern town, and their efforts to learn about the Holocaust is fantastic on so many levels. First, the educators who pioneered the project, in a small school and small town, worked with students to create a truly meaningful, visible way of learning about the Holocaust. When their efforts garnered national and international attention, they seized the opportunity to expand the horizons of student learning and the project took on a life of its own, which provided students with ways to interact with people from all over the world, and from all walks of life. Students not only learned about the Holocaust, they learned about working together for the greater good. They learned that people all over the world, no matter how different you think they might be, are essentially very much alike.

School districts all over the U.S. are rethinking how our students are taught, and trying to find meaningful, relevant ways that engage students. The teachers and principal were far ahead of their time, and educators across the U.S. should watch this film if for no other reason than to be inspired to think outside of the box when it comes to teaching.

A remarkable person who has dedicated the last decade of his life to sharing his story to students near his home around Portland, Oregon, I highly value his opinion.  I am glad that he recommended it to me, because I probably would have passed it by.  In general I'm more interested in learning about the Holocaust itself and not about the meta -- school projects included.

That's why I was surprised by how much this documentary moved me.  What began as a small school project turned into a life-changing event for the entire town of Whitwell, Tennessee.  Through the documentary we see the progression of the project itself, which involved the collection of the paper clips, and how that spread through the media to touch not only the students of the school,  but Holocaust Survivors, their families, German students, and even an American liberator of Mauthausen death camp.  A group of New York Holocaust survivors visited the community and shared their stories, and it was wonderful to see how much their stories affected the community.  After that, the town searched for and eventually found a German cattle car and used it as the foundation of their Holocaust memorial. The way that this project touched others was incredibly moving.  To me, it's less about the project and more about how much the project affected the people who heard about it.

Whitewell, TN is a very special place.  The events of the Holocaust taught the students, teachers, and residents about love and respect for those different than themselves.  What a kind and thoughtful group of students and teachers.  It brought to light my own prejudices about small town, fundamentalist Christian South and shatterd that sterotype, teaching me that with my assumptions that such a group of people are closed-minded and judgemental, I was the judgemental one.

Even if you aren't interested in the paper clip project itself, or school projects centered around the Holocaust, I would highly recommend this documentary.  It was incredible to watch the effect that education about the Holocaust had on this small town, and in turn, the effect that their compassion, love and caring had on the world.",1336262400,2,2260,5.005347593582887

If you are a high school principal, teacher, administrator, student, or even professor, this film is a MUST SEE. It chronicles the efforts of Whitwell middle school(a tiny school in the middle of a tiny town in rural Appalachian Tennessee) and an Assistant Principal and Teacher who brought the idea of collecting 6 million paper clips to their school Principal as a class project. The Paper Clips would represent each of the 6 million Jews who were killed during the Holocaust. The Principal accepts the idea, and the teachers slowly begin to educate their students in regard to the Holocaust. Word slowly begins to spread from this little town in Tennessee and soon people all over the world are sending paperclips to this small school, including celebrities like Tom Hanks, Tom Bosley, Bill Cosby, and others.

Over the course of four years, awareness of the destructiveness of the Holocaust and its effect on the world begins to take root in the teachers, the students, the Principals, and the whole community of mostly white Protestant Americans in this film. By the end of this movie, the reality of the devastation that prejudice and hatred can cause is grasped not only by the students and teachers of Whitwell Middle School, but by the viewers of the movie as well. Added to the documentary are visits to the school by Holocaust survivors who share their stories with the students, teachers, and people from the community. All are moved to tears. Peter Schroeder and his wife, Dagmar Schroeder-Hildebrand, and a journalist for the Washington Post partner with Whitwell Middle school to spread their Paper Clip Holocaust awareness project to the world. NBC news picks up the story and the paperclips start pouring in, each with a story of survival or loss attached to it. Most moving is when Peter and Dagmar search all over Germany for an actual rail car that transported the Jews to the death camps. Successful, they ship the rail car all the way to Tennessee to Whitwell High School and a memorial is built in memory of the Jews and others who died in Nazi Germany. ""As I stepped in the car I could feel the souls crying out,"" are the words of the Principal as she steps into the haunting rail car. I too had the same feeling from my couch as the camera panned through the rail car. The little school had received over 24 million paperclips, and I was moved to tears as they poured the paperclips into the rail car memorial. I envisioned each paper clip representing an actual person whose life had been cut short by hatred, prejudice, jealousy and greed. Imagine the population of whole cities or states totaling 6 million people were all wiped away in a matter of 5 or 6 years. Imagine the devastation to the families and friends of these people. This film is a powerful tool that can be used to teach future generations of children, students, teachers, and humanity of the importance of treating others the way you want to be treated.",1274486400,,3078,4.742537313432836

2465686,3,B000CMNJF4,"Paper Clips / B000CMNJF4

Let's be clear about one thing: this is a truly awesome real-life story. What this town did, in trying to educate their children, is wonderfully admirable. I wish every school in America would focus on these important lessons - on not just the rote memorization of dates, names, and locations, but in teaching children that there are other people out there, different people, and what their lives are like. I was especially moved that not only did the teachers emphasize the trials the Jews faced in WWII, but also emphasized how many good German people exist today who are deeply sorrowful that such a terrible thing happened in their country - it is truly refreshing to see a school handle such a complicated issue so delicately and not succumb to the temptation to exchange one form of racism for another.

Having said that, this documentary is not as good as I'd hoped it would be. I definitely recommend watching it, but as a rental, and not as a purchase, in my opinion. The documentation is somewhat poor, and it is particularly annoying to cut away from speeches of actual survivors to interviews with the children who are summarizing the speech for us. It's good to see that the children really care and are listening, but there's no reason we couldn't have heard both the survivor's speech AND the child summary - ideally the former could be a voice-over during one of the many counting scenes. I recognize that a documentary only has so much time, and probably the crew wanted to focus on the paper clip 'story' and not the meanings behind it, but to do so is something of a betrayal of the *point* of the paper clip project - which was to remember the people who died, and why, so that it could never happen again, and not to just collect a lot of metal.

Which isn't to say this isn't a documentary worth watching - it is. Rent it, watch it, and then decide if you need to buy a copy to add to your home library.

With Paper Clips the viewer is served to an array of rehearsed interviews read with little emotional depth.  This isn't the film makers fault either.

I don't want this bad review to look bad on the kids themselves.  The story of what this school did is amazing and I'm glad it will be remembered for future generations.

As mentioned before, the interviews are very very forced and often completely take the viewer out of the natural amazing events that were documented.

Example: At one point, several holocaust survivors come to town to talk to the kids about what they went through.  The film shows an elderly man beginning to talk about his experience in a concentration camp when they cut the audio from him and splice in an interview of a young girl talking about what the elderly man said.  LET THE HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR SPEAK!  There are many instances where the movie fails to touch deep emotions without trying to do it with the string's and woodwinds playing on the background.",1254096000,8,1232,4.84688995215311

She organizes an effort to collect 6 million paper clips, each one representing a Jewish victim of the Holocaust.  The film follows the students of this school through several years of accomplishment and their ability to achieve and ultimately surpass this goal.

The documentary is definitely produced on a shoe-string budget, and there is very little visual flair or soundtrack to speak of, but the subject matter is more than enough to keep the viewer engrossed in the movie.  The sentiments conveyed by those involved in the project come across clearly and effectively, really showing the viewer the troubles of so many people at the hands of Hitler, and also the triumph of simple little school children decades later.

A few of the scenes deeply moved me, especially the Jewish concentration camp survivors explaining their horrible stories, and made me wonder how anyone who went through that could live any semblance of a normal life post-war.

You see, my students are learning disabled and, if they had lived during this very dark time in history, probably would not have survived this horrific experience. They could identify with those, who through no fault of their own, were persecuted because of the very fact that they were different from the majority.

2465703,4,B000CMNJF4,"The video was especially touching to me, a Jew, and (now former) teacher of children this age. I was born and have lived in Tennessee over half my life in small town similar to Whitwell. It hurt me deeply because I lamented how great it would be if my own community could become so enlightened. It is not. The few Jews here suffer from the same ignorant undercurrent they experience as a non-Christian minority in many places. I no longer teach because of that two-faced gentile hate for Judaism including from those who teach. So when I saw the film it seemed almost too good to be true.

I made contact with the principal featured in the film. I am sure that a few teachers may have been greatly effected by what they learned and then initiated as an exercise against intolerance, and I am sure that most if not all the children were greatly effected for the good. Not all schools would have taken on such a difficult and perhaps controversial project. But I also know that most principals are opportunists (and expected to be) who will do almost anything to promote their school to get money and news/media coverage. That is the feeling I got here also.

But I went to Whitwell, which is close to Chattanooga (you can get on 26 to Jasper, TN and up 127 north to Whitwell), to reconnoiter this area. And of course I wanted to see the boxcar full of paper clips representing the number of victims of systematic murder under the Nazis in Europe and objects from holocaust victims.

It was on a Sunday and finding the little school and a notice that a tape recorder could be picked up at the local police station we went back down the hill to the main road. The guys were nice enough and I can speak Tennessean. ;-) Whitwell is a small place and very typical of small roadside towns in Tennessee. I had a rather long conversation at the cop shop. They gave me the tape recorder with a nearly worn out tape about the Shoa and the project. I hoped this did not indicate a nice effort in the beginning that had petered out since.

By the conversation (I am sorry to be honest here because I do appreciate what those kids did), I don't think it was a community changing experience as portrayed in the movie. Yet I hope the experiment and experience will serve as a inspiration to the children who truly involved themselves and who will hopefully see the world in a better way and pass that on. I hope they do not change as they get older and take on other 'teachers.'

As someone who lived in a town where a few anti-semitic people who did not want a 'Jew teaching their kids' orchestrated a conspiracy to get rid of him, I fear that PaperClips is just a fluke recording a few weeks and months when such bigoted people were pushed aside in order to allow some decency to prevail. PaperClips shows how something that happened to Jews in Europe could strongly effect the hearts of children. Now if only they could be effected continually to resist the hate that infects many small Christian towns in Tennessee and around the world. Maybe they will come to understand why we Jews (and others) have died so many times for being Jews and at whose hands; and finally search their souls why this is so.

Use this movie to consider how people can be, but not to fantasize how people are. That is too good to be true, and it's just not so. It inspires hope for change, not truly proof of it. Hey, but that's a huge, huge step in the right direction. I cried watching it because I realized how cheated I was in my own community. If my town did something similar, I would not believe it to be genuine at all. (To my understanding there are no Jews living in Whitwell. Is it easier to sympathize for Jews dead for 50 years than one living next door, perhaps, as I have found in my own town.) But this community at least tried and went to great lengths to establish their monument to the millions of Jews who were murdered. This makes small town Whitwell, TN  an exception and PaperClips exceptional as a film document of its children's efforts.

The documentary itself is very well done although can be a little hectic. To me, this made it feel like everyday school life. Whatever my opinion and personal take on the actual situation of Jews and Tennessee, it is a film worth watching.

But kids should be given more actual background on the subject of the Shoa (Holocaust) and Christian anti-judaism in Europe over the centuries beforehand (as the students of Whitwell Elementary were) before viewing PaperClips. And if you can drive up or down the beautiful Sequatchie Valley (US 127) stop by and see the boxcar sitting in front of the old school.",1212969600,3,4632,4.45926800472255
2465704,5,B000CMNJF4,"Paper Clips is a documentary about a small town middle school in Tennessee that embarked upon the project of collecting a paper clip for every victim of the holocaust.  The project was not originally intended to be as far reaching as it turned out to be, but due to publicity help by a German couple who were journalists and who had a personal friend who had been a victim of the Nazis during WWII, the students and their teachers began to hear from many who were interested in their project and who sent them paper clips to add to their collections.  In time they were also connected  with survivors of the Nazi concentration camps and eventually obtained a German train car used to transport prisoners to camps which they were able to use as both a monument and a storage of the collections of correspondance and of the paperclips.

2465715,5,B000CMNJF4,"This powerful documentary explores the amazing project undertaken by Whitwell Middle School in Tennessee in 1998, first just to learn about the Shoah and then to collect 6 million paper clips, to have some kind of visual idea of just how many 6 million really is.  They chose the paper clip to represent the murdered because it was invented in Norway in 1899, and during WWII, under the Nazi occupation and the dictatorial rule of the puppet ruler Vidkun Quisling, it was worn on people's collars as a secret symbol of resistance.  But as more and more people nationwide and worldwide heard about their project, they soon far exceeded their original goal of 6 million and ended up getting over 30 million.  The film itself, which also began as a story of how this seemingly unlikely school collected all of these paper clips and began having this class on the Shoah, to teach about tolerance and the dangers of prejudice and discrimination to a group of kids in an extremely homogenous small community, eventually evolved into something more.  It became a story about how 5 Shoah survivors from New York came down to Whitwell and spoke at a local church and the school, with each respective group learning something new about the other, confronting and dissolving their former preconceptions.  And then it turned into an entirely different story again, about the school's efforts to get an authentic railcar from Germany and to convert it into a mini-museum of sorts and a monument to tolerance and love, complete with housing 11 million (now more) of the paper clips, to represent each person who died, and the other victims whose names will never be known because they weren't all documented or accounted for, finally giving a resting place and respect to them in the least likely of all places.

Like many other Northerners, I've often bought into stereotypes about the South and Southerners, just like a lot of the people in the film fell victim to stereotypes about the North and Northerners.  But as this story teaches us, it's very dangerous to stereotype entire groups of people, and to judge entire peoples instead of just singling out individuals who act in unfortunate ways.  The people in this small town, in particular the children at the middle school, embody the ideals of love, tolerance, kindness, and respect, shattering the stereotype that all Southerners are ignorant racist hillbillies who fear or hate anyone or anything that's different.  It also shows that most people will do the right thing simply because it is the right thing, and that children are children wherever one goes, full of curiosity and love, with the power to change the world one step at a time.  It also shatters the stereotype that the younger generation doesn't care about anything or anyone but themselves.  And after watching this powerful film, the viewer may never look at a paper clip the same way ever again.

Features on the bonus disc are interviews with two of the Shoah survivors who came to Whitwell, Rachel Gleitman and Bernard Igielski, interviews with the teachers, students, and some of the townspeople, extended scenes (the most notable of which being the dedication of the railcar museum on 9 November 2001, the 63rd anniversary of Krystallnacht), and a bonus scene, ""A Sabbath Lesson at Ground Zero.""  There's also an interesting audio commentary on the main disc.  Overall, it's full of important, powerful, and thought-provoking lessons for people of all ages and from all geographic regions.",1184025600,2,3507,4.952299829642249
2465716,5,B000CMNJF4,"I purchased this movie last December.

I usually purchase movies only after viewing them.  However, I was fascinated by this story, and purchased the movie without prior viewing.

The documentary is an interesting look not only at the Holocaust, but at relationships between people, and the desire to understand events of history.

In an effort to further diversity education at their school - teachers and administrators at a Tennessee school, along with students, developedh a project to collect 6 million paperclips to represent individuals destroyed by the Holocaust.

The individuals in the film - students, teachers, the journalists who assisted the project - are all absolutely genuine.  They are not afraid to show their own judgements and prejudices, and also express why they have felt this way.  The innocent perspectives of the students is endearing, and genuinely inspiring.

Yes, this is a deeply emotional film.  It is heartbreaking, and amazing.  The holocaust surivors who came and shared their stories, shared their tattoo'd numbers...broke your heart and warmed your spirit.  But in the same respect the desire of these students and educators to learn and UNDERSTAND - their desire to really GRASP JUST HOW MANY 6 MILLION PEOPLE would look like...is phenomenal.  This is a brilliant documentary.

I was also fascinated by the symbolic choice of a paperclip...

I am very glad I purchased this film, it is an amazing story, enlightening.  And it gives you a sense of what people can accomplish.  Gathering paperclips seemed overwhelming in the beginning, but what the students do, with the help of journalists, family, etc. is phenomenal.  I truly get tingles and goosebumps thinking about this film.  And was breathless when the journey of the Train car from germany intersected modern history on September 11.

There is much to learned from history.

When one sets out on just such a journey, I believe often, the resources come to us.  And I think this story displays how seeking out to accomplish the goal of education brought many people together, and created an example of just what the world lost during the Holocaust.

Each paperclip represented one life, a life with lost potential.  Each paperclip was treated with such an endearing respect; handled by someone who thought about the person who might have been...

But how to teach it? They would collect one paper clip for each person killed by Hitler--six million in all, inspired by Norwegians who had worn a paper clip on their lapel during the war to protest the Holocaust. The project stalled after an initial burst of energy and enthusiasm, then a reporter for the Washington Post and the NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw ran pieces about the project. In the end they collected 27 million paper clips from around the world, 11 million of which they displayed in a rail car that had transported Jews to the death camps. Walls fall, and hearts open. The teachers tell how they stereotype northerners, and even their own students. The town meets Holocaust survivors who speak in the local Methodist church. This might not be a great documentary film.

It grabbed me from the beginning,because like one of students said ""I don't know what six million looks like""! I, and how many others really have trouble grasping that concept? What an amazing idea for the teacher to make it real and understandable for the class. One could only dream for a teacher such as this for their children,and a community who would be willing to share as much as this one did. Then after watching how this project touched so many hearts,I watched the DVD extras and was blown away doubly to learn how many others were moved to contribute their time,and talents to help this project. So many were such a blessing and I have no doubt they were blessed for it. I believe there can be no doubt that God was extremely pleased and an active partner in the production of this film.

I just read yesterday that another school, (for a Hebrew class) is collecting pennies for the same type of project and I pray that everyone involved will be as blessed and be a blessing as in this case. It would be wonderful if this film was required viewing in every Jr. High school.  I truly believe once seen,never forgotten. It will make you think on so many levels. Not only does it make you think about hatred,but also about the danger of total passivity when a group with radical ideology,such as the U.K.,France,Norway, and others are now experiencing from the radical Muslims,but it also makes you think about how the film shows the truth of what Anne Frank said ""when people hear about something good they want to be part of it"" and make you think how we all would love to share in the community spirit that this community of Whitwell,Tennesse experienced.",1167782400,3,1785,4.506172839506172

2465730,5,B000CMNJF4,"I hesitate to say this is a wonderful MOVIE, because it would suggest that the filmmakers are somehow responsible for the film's content. Granted, it's a documentary, and things like fancy camerawork, beautiful location shots, and dramatic panning shots might add to a documentary such as MARCH OF THE PENGUINS, but PAPER CLIPS is different.

The documentarians are there simply to serve as the vessel to get the story out. Nothing more, nothing less. And I give them credit for simply doing that. Because it is the teachers and children in Whitwell, Tennessee that fully deserve to have their story told.

A tiny, little town of some 1600 people about 40 miles northeast of Chattanooga, Tennessee, Whitwell is NOT the place I would have expected to hear about a multi-year middle school project that focused on the Holocaust. Perhaps this is because of my OWN ""Northeast bias,"" but I give these folks a LOT of credit. As they mentioned in the movie, there is not one Jewish person who lives in this town... how unselfish of them to instill in their youngest citizens an awareness of the horrors of racism taken to its most extreme degree.

What starts out as a discussion about the holocaust, leads them to a project of symbolism. When told of Hitler's extermination of six million Jews, one of the students remarks that they can't really comprehend what the number ""six million"" represents.

So they set out to find something that thay can collect six million of in order to give deeper meaning to the enormity of the Holocaust. They settle on paper clips, and after a few months, they realize that it's likely going to take them the better part of a decade to reach their goal.

But then word gets out about the project. And when Tom Brokaw announces what's going on in little Whitwell, Tennessee on the NBC Nightly News, the WORLD finds out about it... and not only do literally TONS of paperclips start pouring into the little burg, but they also start getting visits from Holocaust survivors.

The scenes where the men and women who made it out of the concentration camps come to the school to tell the stories of their loved ones who did not, is to say the least, extraordinarily moving.

In the end, the people of Whitwell placed an incredible memorial at the Middle School. I won't give away what it is, but suffice to say, it is NOT simply a colossal pile of paper clips. In fact, if I ever find myself traveling in that part of the country, I would feel compelled to visit. And to tell the people of Whitwell how wonderful they are.

That's saying a lot, given the fact that it started out as a simple middle school study project.

2465740,5,B000CMNJF4,"Sometimes it frightens me to think of what our future will be, in an age where most households have two parents that have to work and we rely on the village to help us raise them, I take comfort in knowing there is a place like this little town in TN.

They may be ""poor"" or in a ""depressed"" economy like the principal stated, but they are rich in the things that count most in this world.

I watched this film for the first time last evening with my 11 year old daughter, the tissue box was never far from hand because the entire story was so moving to us.

There is a young man who was in one of the first group of 8th graders that was at the time of the documentary getting ready for college, he stated that he can't wait for the question to come up in some of his interviews for schools about what's been the most significant event in your life to date, he said this project will be his answer how could it not?

From the survior who told his story of being seperated from his mother and younger brother at the camps only to discover that they had been sent to the cremitorium upon entering, to the vice principals admission that he was guilty of prejudice against not only other races but his students and their value as people,I was heartbroken.

If you can watch this film and not have a life altering experience from it I would be shocked.  I think every school should host a talk with survivors because as one of them pointed out the only way people will know about it after they are gone is by what they've read in books.

I've read books, I've read the Diary of Anne Frank for school myself, but nothing compares to hearing their accounts first hand, in print you can imagine it as fiction because you mind doesn't want to imagine such things could be true, in person you can't deny the power of their spirts and the events that shaped their lives.

I stopped at a gas station to ask directions and they sent me to the police station to get the key and a tape recorded tour. I spent about 90 minutes in the exhibit.  It was so quiet, almost sacred.  The story changed me in some ways.  I look at things differently.  And visiting the site and actually seeing what they have done there, and how it has grown (they have added a sculpture and are reaching out to other schools and children) was amazing!

Hooper seems to be a small scale version of those get-it-done women like Florence Nightingale and Mother Teresa. She knows how to move mountains to get what she wants. Teacher Sandra Roberts heads the supporting cast, changing her hairstyle but not her love for students. Watch her high-five the kids every day. This is one great teacher.

The bonus features were limited to a commentary track which I enjoyed immensely. Apparently the school resisted the film crew initially because other media groups had depicted the students as dumb hillbillies.

Highlights were visits of Holoscaust survivors and arrival of the German railay car -- an amazingly great idea. We're not told who paid for shipping.

2465744,5,B000CMNJF4,"A lot of reviewers have panned this documentary because of its lack of filmic sophistication, its cheesy voice over narrations, the planned sound of some of the interviews, and its ""pedagogical hyperbole""(these points are true -- but I think these so-called flaws actually affirm to the viewer the cultural roots of this documentary). I think the reason to see Paperclips, and to clap bravo, is not because it breaks new filmmaking ground, but because it is about love. Yes, there are TONS of Hollywood movies about ""love."" But this documentary about a Holocaust project at a homogeneous middle school in rural Whitwell, Tennessee (population 1,600), shows the real deal in action as it transforms not only the attitudes of the teachers  -- principal Linda Hooper, vice-principal David Smith, and teacher Sandra Roberts -- and the students, but Whitwell itself.

The Paperclip Project started as a special eighth-grade class designed to teach diversity and address issues of hate and intolerance. During the first year of the project (1998), a student learned that the Norwegians wore paperclips on their lapels in defiance of the Nazis.  The eighth graders decided to collect six million paperclips as both a way to understand such an overwhelming figure, and as a tribute to the Jews who died in the Holocaust.  However, the students attempt to solicit paperclips through a letter writing campaign was not very successful.  Then, as fate would have it, two German journalists (White House correspondents Peter and Dagmar Schroeder) wrote a story about the Whitwell project and suddenly ""changing the world one paperclip at a time"" blossomed in to something that no one in Whitwell could have imagined.

Put your world weary cynicism aside for an hour or two, and watch (look at the faces, they tell the story) these earnest, open-hearted students (and the teachers and the townsfolk too) as they find themselves creating a final resting place for some of the broken-hearted memories of those touched directly by the horror of Hitler's ""Final Solution.""",1151193600,7,2054,5.153153153153153

For those of you who don't know what I'm talking about, in 1998, Whitwell, TN's schools started a project on prejudice.  They just meant to open the minds of their mostly Caucasian, Protestant, kids.

They started viewing Holocaust films and research uncovered that Norweigans wore paperclips on their collars during WWII in memory of the people lost in Hitler's concentration camps.

The kids started collecting paperclips.  As more people found out, the world got involved--and a beautiful film and memorial was created.  It also changed the lives of many of the students and residents of the town.

This is an amazing film and a testament to the power of committed and concerned people. It is just amazing how these kids from rural Tennessee got together with people from all over the world to give wings both to people who died in concentration camps, but also to allow the survivors to tell their stories.

Probably one of the most amazing touching moments in this film was when a suitcase full of paperclips arrived at the TN school from a class of German students who were writing and apologising to Ann Frank.",1149984000,6,1203,4.800970873786408
2465747,5,B000CMNJF4,"This is a fantastic documentary that should be seen by all.  It's powerful and moving and simply amazing.
It's a story about a school in Whitwell, TN which is a small town about 24 miles North West of Chatanooga.  There is only 2 traffic lights.  Linda Hooper the school Principal talks about how there is such a lack of diversity in the school - no Jews, Catholics, only 5 black kids and 1 hispanic.  The kids at the school were very sheltered and knew nothing about other cultures.  She sent the assistant principal, David Smith to a conference in Chatanooga in 1998 to find a school project.  He came back with the idea for a project on the Holocaust and approached the 8th grade teacher (Sandra Roberts) if she wanted to help.  They set out to teach the kids about a totally different culture to their own.  The goal was to teach them what happens when people are ignorant, predjudice  and intolorant.
1998 started with the Holocaust project (the teachers were learning as they went too).  When the kids found out that 6 million Jews were killed, one child asked how to comprehend how many was 6 million.  That's how the project began because the teacher said for them to collect something and look at what 6 million actually looked like.
The kids found out that paper clips were invented in Norway and that during the Nazi occupation in Norway during World War II, Norwegians made the paper clip a symbol of national unity.  They would wear the clips on their collars to represent the people in the holocaust.  The kids asked to write to famous people and other schools to ask them to send clips.  Tom Hanks, Tom Bosley, Bill Clinton and Bill Cosby are just some of the famous people that sent some to them.
Each year the next lot of 8th graders would take over from where the last years 8th graders left off.  Clips came in spurts.  Sometimes slowly and then heaps poured in.  They were realising that this would take some time to collect them.  After this story was released to NBC, clips came in thousands.  Eventually they had about 24 million clips.  The post office could no longer deliver them to the school; the school would have to come and collect them themselves because there were so many.
This is an amazing journey - you see these children learn so much and do so much good for other people.  You see Survivors themselves come to talk to the kids and share their stories.  This is when even the teachers get to see that this isn't just a story but a real life event that should never be forgotten.  You hear the assistant principal talk about how he hopes his own children don't make racial slurs like his father did.  It's very emotional to see.
A rail car has been used to store the clips in.  It's an authentic German rail car.  They got it to America and that's where the clips are.  All the kids from previous years etc helped put the clips in the car.  The car remains a symbol at Whitwell where it will stay.
You have to see this documentary.  I can't stress enough how good this is and how moving and educational to many people.  It's a must see and I highly highly recommend it to everyone.",1149811200,4,3118,4.447971781305115
2465748,5,B000CMNJF4,"Paper Clips is a documentary film about a teacher in a small town in Tennessee, who got a school project started while teaching the Holocaust to her students.

She not only wanted them to learn of the horrors of the Holocaust, but wanted the children to comprehend what the astronomical number of six million (The number of Jews murdered)LOOKED LIKE. It is easy to SAY the number, but a valuable lesson for the kids to actually SEE the number.

Once the project gets under way, and word gets to the media, paper clips POUR in from not only the US, but from all over the world. It is amazing. Jewish  families of victims come to the school to speak, we see the post office get bogged down with mail,

More importantly, than all of these things though, we FEEL the suffering of the doomed Jews who were put in those boxcars like sardines, lied to, and drove to concentration camps and/or thier death.

We see a boxcar memorial from the children that is very touching. One woman in the film said it was horrible to walk into it, to imagine the terror these people must have felt being boxed inside of them.

When I went to school , not much attention was paid to the Holocaust, and I think it SHOULD be.

This Documentary itself is a good teaching tool.

They still persisted & their willingness to continue to ""stand"" was richly rewarded. In a day & age where there are people in positions of influence & authority out there who would try to have us believe the Holocaust never happened, I was very heartened to see how a small, rural community was used instrumentally to remind the world of just how REAL the Holocaust really was.
