4856490,5,B005P89G98,"I am not into sports that much, but this is a great movie.  It is really funny in that ""I just need to watch something outrageous"" kind of way.  The music in the film I really liked as well.  It is obviously a movie you can't take to seriously, and that is what I love about it, a film you can watch, which touches on a lot of issues but in a funny, over the top way that just makes you chuckle through out.  Well Done!!",1335139200,,420,3.8488372093023258
4856491,4,B005P89G98,"If you've ever played on any gay sports team (not necessarily a soccer team), you will very much identify with this film. Especially if you play teams other than other gay teams! All the drama, on and off the field, represented in a 'real-time' story of one day on the soccer pitch. I enjoy the dialogue that Rikki Beadle-Blair has in his films. Realistic, insightful and at times truly bitchy!",1334966400,,394,4.642857142857143

4856493,5,B005P89G98,"This movie has to be at the top of my favorite movies. I loved the drama that twirled up into comedy, along with the cute guys in this movie, plus the positive influence of being yourself. No matter what you need to be true to yourself.

4856494,2,B005P89G98,"It was alright and I like British movies, but it lacked in a couple areas. Every stereotype possible was in the movie on the gay team. It had its moments however, I'm just glad I didn't buy the movie.",1332115200,3,200,4.153846153846154
4856495,5,B005P89G98,"I downloaded this and watched it.  It was a great quality download.  the movie was ok.  I liked it, lots of brittish slang.  I thought it was funny in spots",1330819200,,156,4.1
4856496,2,B005P89G98,"I wish I could muster half the enthusiasm for this British flik as the other reviewers so far have. I had previously enjoyed the far superior '10 Men Out' and 'Guys And Balls,' but this one tried my patience. It plays like a neverending one-act stage piece shot outdoors, as if moving the action of 'Boys In The Band' from a NY apartment to a small soccer field. The characters bicker and bitch loudly and ferociously for the entire film. Some restraint here and there was, apparently, never a consideration. And, yes, you'll need English Subtitles to understand half of what they're rattling off. I'm afraid drag queen banter runs very thin with me. Though the film tackles issues of self indentity and homophobia, the endles prattle wears thin very quickly. It wore me out after 15 minutes: I had to finish this thing in segments, just to see if it was going anywhere. (It does - eventually.) I wish gay writers would not confuse being witty with being bitchy: the former is a pleasure, the latter a drag - no pun intended. The two stars are for the eye candy, and the young cast's efforts to make this one-gag effort come alive, but the ""script"" looks to have been shot as they went along; characters keep popping up as if only to stretch out the proceedings so as to get a feature length film out of a 30 minute short subject. A rental, not a keeper.",1330473600,5,1354,4.48582995951417
4856497,5,B005P89G98,"Although I am not very much of a ""sport enthusiast"", I certainly enjoyed this splendid and very humorous movie about a straight and very tough soccer team that comes up against an even tougher, in spirit and determination,  gay soccer team (thought to be, of all things at first, very homophobic)that is  clad in fuchsia gear--causing the captain of the gay team to come ""unhinged"" and the team members to forget momentarily that they are suppose to act straight breaking into a very funny  dance routine--I loved it.

This film, as has been noted on this board, is sort of reminiscent of previous sport-themed gay movies.  (i.e., ""Broken hearts club"" and ""Summer Storm"").  I really derived much pleasure watching the hysterical antics of both teams and listening to the very funny banter between the characters.  Of course there are serious issues to deal with (such as: drug addiction, homophobia, family loyalties, relationship problems, acceptance of what one is, etc.)All of the problems are dealt with in often amusing ways.  As has been previously stated before, ""Kickoff"" has loads of ""heart"".

This film is so well directed, filmed and, most of all, acted.  Thanks to the acting, I adored all of the characters even the frustrated wives, girlfriends along with the boyfriend of one of the players that use to be a fierce bully, even the super macho, steroid-crazed star of the straight team.

If you want some light entertainment that will make you have some good laughs, buy this film.  I  used the ""subtitles"" because that British accents got a little ""thick"" and the dialog is very funny; you'll want to ""catch"" every line.

(I must add that the film became extremly wonderful to me when the gay team became known as a gay team rather then just a good soccer team that was winning the match.  Once the gay team became themselves, the movie became, to me, truly delightful and it was wonderful to begin with.)",1329177600,3,1920,4.82874617737003
4856498,4,B005P89G98,"This movie is high social slapstick and at times hysterically demented; a truely ZANY comidy the likes of which I haven't seen in a long time. The first thirty minutes will have you wondering what insane asilem this cast of misfits excaped from, and have you laughfing all the way to the middle where it takes some heavy dramatic dodges and then comes back for a great finish. Don't give up on it when it seems to wander-- it snaps back!

It is low budget, but that is one of the things that makes it work. What carries it over the top is the wrighting and acting.

This is a very fun and funny movie, well worth a watch.",1326931200,,621,4.2100840336134455
4856499,5,B005P89G98,"At last a film that does what it says on the box. I pre- ordered this a month before release and was hoping that it would meet half my expectations; it has done more than that.

The plot is pretty straightforward, in that a gay 5 a side football (or soccer to our American chums) team wants to enter the Sunday Soccer league, but the `captain' is desperate to keep their gayness hidden. He has left it to his boyfriend to order the kit and he chooses pink (sorry fuscia!). In a fit of anger he tears off the tops of all the team, and things just get sexier from that point.

That is not a plot spoiler, as I kinda knew that was the point of the film. But what happens is a story of all of the participants, as they face up to the many demons that face them. We have fag hags, misplaced attraction, and a step dad who just wants to do the right thing. This is not a sex fuelled film, but more a study in relationships, and with a real south London twist.

To quote the cover the referee `Elton Glixton struggles to control this testosterone tsunami as rude boys meet bum boys in this outrageous new British comedy.' Whilst there is a lot of humour, there is so much more, and I really got more from this than I was expecting. I intend to watch again and cannot recommend this highly enough.

At 98 mins long this is not an epic but considering it is all about a footie match that lasts less than an hour; it is ruddy excellent. This is my favourite Peccadillo (UK) presentation since Summer sturm, and a real one man effort in the shape of Rikki Beadle Blair, who wrote, produced and directed as well as acting in this little gem, you may remeber him from 'Fit', and a few of the cast from this too. He does the music too and whilst it could benefit from a better soundtrack, he makes a good fist of it (pun intended). Can not wait for his next one.",1322697600,11,1848,4.153631284916201
4856500,3,B005P89G98,Kick Off was interesting and attention getter for me.. so what do you think.. depends if this is what you like.,1370476800,,111,4.333333333333333
4856501,4,B005P89G98,"This is both a funny and tragic story at the same time, as two teams battle it out on the football field (soccer for us yanks), many real issues with each player comes out as they struggle to deal with it all.",1365811200,,209,4.0
4856502,3,B005P89G98,"This is not a great film, but it's fun to watch, well written and acted. There's an eclectic, ensemble cast of misfit footballers, representing a range of gay stereotypes, trying to come together as a team and to terms with who they are. There's a lot of family and identity baggage enhancing the story. The supposedly straight-identifying men the gay team plays against are just as confused and inept as they are. There are quite a few wonderful lines -- one about Paco Rabanne had me laughing aloud -- that are well delivered, but the Brit-slang was sometimes tough to follow. Undoubtedly, some of the fun stuff blew right past me.  But don't let the potential ""language barrier"" stop you from enjoying this low carb treat.",1363737600,,725,4.753968253968254
4856503,3,B005P89G98,"This movie was just funny enough, just campy enough, and just poignent enough to be worth a watch. However, I probably won't watch it again.",1363478400,,140,4.64
4856504,5,B005P89G98,"This is a great comedy with fun and colorful characters...  Little surprises along the way to the cute and smile-infectious ending.

4856506,1,B005P89G98,This movie has no story line to it & is was the worst movie I did not even watched due to it been unrealistic to real life.,1355529600,2,123,3.5925925925925926
4856507,4,B005P89G98,"I love how the focus isn't just placed on one team, or a few characters.  All the characters have a story to tell and they get time to shine.  For this, one has to give credit to the writer/director/actor of the film, Rikki Beadle Blair.  He took his time developing the story so it wasn't cliche.  I only wish his staged version of this work was available for performances.",1352160000,,374,4.3768115942028984
4856508,2,B005P89G98,"I like trying all sorts of gay film titles, and in my experience comedies usually have a rougher go of it than dramas, which is too bad because we all need to laugh...",1346889600,3,167,4.090909090909091
4856509,3,B005P89G98,"Good script, casting and decent acting.  I like gay themed movies a lot.  This is the first time that I saw a gay soccer team wanting to pretend to be straight, although they were far from it.  Reminded me of Soccer Pimp video.",1339200000,,227,4.232558139534884

8482391,5,B005P89G98,"This movie is great It seems like an obvious movie, maybe even a bit cliche, but the plot spins and twists and EVERY character has a backstory.  Highly recommend.",1429920000,,162,4.586206896551724
8482392,1,B005P89G98,"Very lame, boring, no story-line at all. Most stories should have a beginning, middle & an end. Maybe this is English humor but it does not translate  into great American humor. The characters lack development, and pretty much character. A Will and Grace episode on their worst day will entertain you better than 10 minutes of this flop of a film  Don't waste your time of money on this one.",1424822400,,391,4.571428571428571
8482393,5,B005P89G98,"This movie is more than just another ""gay"" title.  I loved the witty exchanges and bantering that goes along with classic British humour which is very evident in this title.  It also shows a team of players just wanting to play football with being gay as the common bond they share.  When the opposing team shows up being the one that they weren't expecting, it was time to change their strategy and show their opponents that they could be a force to reckoned with as well.  Throughout the whole movie, surprise spectators showed up causing grief for both sides of the fence.  This movie can be a little hard to follow at times but does bring it all back together at the end.  For a low budget film, the actors were superb in playing their roles and made it interesting by contributing all of their unique personalities for a great performance.  It should make you laugh with the many dramatic and comedic situations they find themselves facing.  A great tribute to Justin Fashanu.",1405036800,,981,4.630057803468208

8482397,5,B005P89G98,Its the gays vs the straights yet again in this funny story about two soccer teams playing one another.  Love the British gay films. Great for any collector to have to laugh out loud.,1371600000,,183,4.382352941176471
