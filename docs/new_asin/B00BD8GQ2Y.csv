5581369,5,B00BD8GQ2Y,More than frybread done in a very convincing mocumentary style work for this movie you have to know the native culture to get this movie but very funny would recommend,1401321600,5,167,4.6
5581370,4,B00BD8GQ2Y,"This video was funny and made a great 'mockumentary'.  I loved that it had mostly Native actors and some of the scenarios were very cute and well thought-through. If you want a serious film, don't watch this, but if you want some good, clean fun and to see a fry bread sporting event watch this. You won't regret it. (WARNING! Do not watch this video if you are hungry, because you might go slightly insane with fry bread cravings. I'm not lying.)",1397260800,14,447,4.451219512195122
5581371,5,B00BD8GQ2Y,I finally got to see this movie and I love it.  Definitely a fantastic mockumentary as good as any Christopher Guest parody.  This will definitely be a go-to movie to watch over and over.,1372464000,8,187,4.470588235294118

8566642,5,B00BD8GQ2Y,"An excellent and entertaining film, which can be loosely described as ""Spinal Tap Goes to the Rez.""

Holt Hamilton has pursued an enviable career as an independent filmmaker heavily (or even exclusively) focused on making Native-American-focused movies with Native American actors.  Most of his films are dramas, for which ""More Than Frybread"" is a tickle-your-ribs exception.  This approach (and the films and their actors) deserve greater acclaim than they appear to be getting, and the films deserve wider promotion than they currently receive.  Perhaps this is because it is the opposite of the US film industry's self-promoting, attention-seeking, leftist-committed, CGI-laden Hollywood?",1447718400,6,692,5.821782178217822
