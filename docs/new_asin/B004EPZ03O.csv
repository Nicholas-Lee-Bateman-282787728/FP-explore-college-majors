4339751,2,B004EPZ03O,"Beginning with one of the happiest, and most uplifting songs I've ever heard in my life, titled ""Life's A Happy Song,"" this film was headed in all the right directions.  Instead, it takes a dark and rather depressing turn, doing for the Muppets what ""Babe: Pig in the City"" did for that franchise.

Jason Segel and Amy Adams are very likable as the main actors, and the new ""whistling"" Muppet is great, but it would have been good to see some of the funnier character like Ratzo, Peppe the Prawn, and Gonzo doing some funny bits.

There are so many great characters to work with here, they really missed a golden opportunity to bring back a winning franchise.

Next time, maybe Disney will let their Pixar team tell the story...",1322006400,6,728,4.576923076923077
4339752,4,B004EPZ03O,"At the end of the day, the underlying subject of this movie is:  ""We are The Muppets: If modern society decides we are no longer funny and popular, we're ok with that.  We are just here to entertain for those who will appreciate.""

I'm not a professional critic, so there's no need for me to bore everyone with an over-analyzed, granular review.  What I can say is I (like many folks) have been a die hard Muppet fan since I was a kid in the early 80's.  Jim Henson was a genius and the world became a slightly darker place when we lost him.  I lost touch with The Muppets over the years as they tried to re-envision themselves and relate to a new generation.  Though still popular, it wasn't the same to me.  This new film is the closest thing that I have seen in attempting to return to their truly zany days when you had Henson, Oz, Hunt, and Nelson leading the charge.

Jason Segel (who co-wrote the screenplay) didn't have to do his research.  It's obvious he has been a fan of the Muppet-brand of humor for a long time.  There were so many subtle homages to the classic essence of Henson and The Muppets that will fly under the radar of many, and yet they still managed to write a genuinely, caring story that will hold the attention of a new generation.  Also, in the tradition of classic Muppet movies, keep your eyes peeled for ""blink and you'll miss them"" cameos by movie stars of all generations.

Additionally, I would like to point out that it was refreshing to see a plethora of classic, overlooked Muppets from the past getting their time in the spotlight in this movie:  Lew Zealand, The News Anchor, Marvin Suggs, Uncle Deadly, along with the ALWAYS hip Electric Mayhem just to name a few.

I will close this review by saying, the absolute best part of seeing this movie was NOT looking around and seeing adults and kids in the theater laughing together at the same moments, but sitting next to a woman about my age with her two kids.  (**Very minor spoiler) - - During a scene in which Walter is looking around the old Muppet theater, old pictures on the wall featuring Jim Henson and other Muppet history came into view.  I heard the mom next to me sniffle, and I too wiped a few tears away.  Her daughter leaned over and whispered, ""....why are you crying?"".  Her mother turned to her and said, ""...you wouldn't understand.""  I couldn't have said it better.",1322006400,245,2377,4.433179723502304
4339753,4,B004EPZ03O,"On Saturday (11/19), my son and I attended an advance screening of the new movie ""The Muppets"".  From the moment I received the invitation, I started going back in time to when my entire family would gather in the family room to watch The Muppets on TV.

I remember the show format being similar to ""Laugh In"" and 'Sonny and Cher"" (if you are old enough to remember back that far).  I was in love with Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog and Fozzie's silly jokes cracked me up. Everyone was rooting for Gonzo to finally do one of his hair brained stunts right and the dancing chickens were the hit of the evening. And each show was always hosted by one of the biggest stars in Hollywood. When I told my son that I was a few years older that he is now when the show first came on TV, he said ""Dang! The Muppets are that old?"" Don't you just love kids...

The movie ""The Muppets"" starts out back in the day when the TV show was still a major hit. A little boy (well, more puppet than boy) named Walter who doesn't fit in with the rest of the kids in the neighborhood discovers The Muppets Show on TV and lives and breathes everything Muppets related all the way into adulthood. His brother Gary (played by Jason Segel) it very protective of Walter, much to the chagrin of his very, very long time girlfriend Mary (played by Amy Adams). What was suppose to be romantic getaway to LA for Mary and Gary, turns into a trip to the old Muppets studios by the threesome.

The Muppet Theater is now in major disrepair because the gang has all gone their separate ways.  Kermit is in seclusion. Miss Piggy is now a Vogue editor in Paris. Fonzie Bear is living foul doing bad theater in Reno and Animal is in a mental institution with actor Jack Black. When a evil oilman plans to take over the Muppet Studios and tear it down, Gary talks the Muppet gang into getting back together to raise enough money to save the studio from ruin.

The movie is a totally cute vehicle for introducing a new audience to The Muppets while also taking the people who grew up watching the show in the 1970's back down memory lane.  My son thought all the silly gags and fart jokes were great and I was singing The Muppets song and totally enjoying getting re-acquitted with all the characters from my youth.

My favorite character is still Miss Piggy and she was adorable with all her clothing and hair changes throughout the movie. My son was rolling when Miss Piggy started karate chopping everyone. And when Kermit started singing ""The Rainbow Connection"" I was singing right along with him.

Just like in the original series, his movie had cameo appearances from major Hollywood stars like Mickey Rooney, Alan Arkin, Selena Gomez, Whoopi Goldberg, and Neil Patrick Harris.

If you were not a Muppets fan before, you will be after seeing this cute movie.  And don't say I did not warn you when you start singing ""The Rainbow Connection"" and ""Mahna Mahna"" on your way home :)

""The Muppets"" opens in theaters Wednesday November 23, 2011 and is rated PG due to signature Muppets fantasy violence.",1321920000,43,3062,4.456171735241503

 This movie earned soley from The US around $88,625,922 that means not only kids watched this movie but many adults as well saw this too.
 It was such a heart warming colorful dance around, lots of songs and most of all Born for Disney actress Amy Adams movie this was.
 She was in this movies like <ENCHANTED> and I always dreamed like she won't ever become old. But who cares. She will be gorgeous even if she will be old just like July Andrews and will still look great anyway.

This movie is full of fun.
 We all grow up with this muppets after all.

The final stage scene was just hillarious and I enjoyed it so so much.
 They are just even better then the TV show.
 The director also made <THE MUPPET MOST WANTED><ALICE IN WONDERLAND 2> as well. Although the ALICE movie failed at the boxoffice, it was still a good try I think.

Anyway whenever actors are singing and dancing, I felt like I wanted to sing and dance too.
 All the rolls from this movie are just hillarious to look at they are so charming.

It is a bit sad that Amy gain some weight and a bit old though.

Anyway if you want something old fashioned pure Disney magic, this is yours, all yours.
 So is it all childish?
 Hell no.
 It's just so pure and warm heart that's all.
 No violence, no sex or no action or no curse that' all.

It is not difficult to buy this movie from anywhere near you.

Well we were on the beautiful island of Hawaii a while back and I took the soundtrack from this movie with me and played it through the bluetooth of the rental car.  So there we were enjoying the beautiful Hawaiian scenery listening to Mickey Rooney and Amy Adams and Kermit and Jason Segal sing ""Life's a Happy Song"" and ""Rainbow Connection"" and singing along in sheer Paradise-induced happiness!  And like other that time we flew over another part of Hawaii many years ago in a helicopter listening to ""Over The Rainbow"" by the late great Israel Kamakawiwo'ole over the headphones...a song and a scene so beautiful that it brought tears to my eyes.  Doggone, it was all just so doggone BEAUTIFUL... all of it, the music, the scenery, the company of my beloved Wifey!  Hawaii is truly The Reward one gets for working and struggling and putting up with crime and traffic and taxes and politics...even if only for a short while before you have to go back home for a year or so.  But now, now that we're back in The Mainland, with work and crime and traffic and taxes and politics, all I have to do is put in The Muppets or Kamakawiwo'ole in my ear (or the bluetooth in my car), and my mind and soul are instantly transported back to the Paradise that is Hawaii...or anywhere there is beautiful music and scenery and happy experiences with people you love, and like the song says, ""...I can't seem to wipe this smile off my face!""  Life's a Happy Song.  It really is.

The original Muppet movie gave us a fantasy that inspired many generations and this movie shows the ugly reality of having too much fantasy in your life - set to music. I appreciate the concept, i just wonder whose idea this was.
  The only thing i am kinda disappointed in is this version of Ms. Piggy. I agree with another reviewer that says she was not over the top enough.
  My biggest complaint seems minor but it kinda ruined the movie for me. The decision to give Ms. Piggy's voice a prominent spot in the ""Rainbow Connection"" song.  The song is light and smooth an Ms. Piggy is not.",1447632000,,698,4.257575757575758

There are many cameos and even Amy Adams as a co-staring role. The movie has a large focus on comedy and sees itself as for what it is. Often times they make jokes about it's own past. It does a good job of being accessible for both an adult audience and a younger one. The comedy can go from just absurdity, to straight up jokes, to recalling the earlier movies. There are several songs which are also funny but well written too. The disc has an out take reel which is surprisingly funny and a few other extras to add onto the movie.

4340850,3,B004EPZ03O,"Having become a big Muppets fan in the last few years, The Muppets was a must see on my holiday movie list for 2011.  And somehow November and December came and went without me making it to see the movie in the theater.  So, I made a rare exception to my normal rule and bought the movie on Blu-Ray.  Unfortunately, the movie is slightly disappointing.

The story is told to us by Walter (voiced by Peter Linz).  Growing up, he's different from other boys, but he's close with his brother.  It's not until he finds The Muppet Show that he feels like he truly belongs.  In fact, he becomes obsessed with the show and their biggest fan.

Flash forward to now and Walter still lives with his brother Gary (Jason Segel). Garyis taking his girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams) toLos Angelesas a 10th anniversary present, and as a surprise he has a ticket for Walter as well.  Walter can't wait to visit Muppet Studios, but the place is all but deserted.  Hiding in Kermit's old office, Walter hears a plot by Tex Richman (Chris Cooper) to destroy the studio and drill for the oil underneath.

The trio head to find Kermit, figuring he'll know what to do.  He's reluctant to get the gang back together for a show to save the studio, but eventually, he's talked into it.  Will that work?

Right off the bat, this movie had one strike against it.  The plot was recycled from the made for TV movie It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie.  Okay, some of the plot points were different, but it's still felt like a rip off to me.

Still, the movie started out well.  There were lots of touching moments as Walter struggled to fit into life in the real world and then we looked back at the Muppets' career.  You felt the sense of loss Kermit was dealing with as he thought about his friends.

And there were some great moments of comedy.  I'm not going to spoil the gags, but they are perfectly in line with the feel of the show over the years.

Plus there are the cameos.  Whether as characters or themselves, there are tons of well known people in the movie, sometimes in blink and you miss them moments.  I had a lot of fun with that.  There are also plenty of jokes at 80's pop culture, which was lots of fun.

And I'm not going to fault the cast, human or Muppet.  All the performances were perfect the this film.

However, the movie felt like it was trying too hard.  What it was trying for, I'm not quite sure.  The jokes weren't quite there to keep things going.  The story became a bit too predictable and lost it's fun in the final act.  And don't get me started on the ending.  I don't quite get that one at all.

I think part of the problem is that the Muppets work best when they are creating jokes.  Here, they had to carry a movie, including serious moments.  That's not their real strength.  Frankly, I think the movie needed more laughs.

That point was driven home to me when I was watching the bonus feature on the Blu-Ray.  The behind the scenes featurette had some info in it, but it was also just plain silly.  Same with the bloopers.  And the spoof trailers were a riot.  If the movie had included more of that kind of stuff, it would have been great.

Yes, I enjoyed The Muppets.  But it wasn't nearly as good as it could have been.  More laughs would have definitely made for a better film.",1432598400,,3295,4.329508196721312

4340852,4,B004EPZ03O,I had to watch The Muppets twice before I even liked it. The 1st time I watched The Muppets I HATED it. The 2nd time I picked it up at the local library & I wasn't sure if I should give it another chance. I'm glad I did though because I enjoyed it the 2nd time around. Some songs were way corny especially the 1st 1 & even though I HATE musicals I've loved The Muppets since I was a little kid & that's what helped me sit through it all. The 1 Muppet I wished they would've included but left out was Rizzo The Rat. I wouldn't buy the movie but it's good enough that it's worth taking a look at,1432080000,,593,3.8688524590163933

4341655,3,B004EPZ03O,"This movie is like ""Muppest Wizard of Oz"" or ""Letters to Santa."" A watchable little...thing...for die-hard fans, and easily-amused children. But not a real Muppet movie.

I don't *hate* this movie. It is watchable, and has a few good moments. But there's a lot wrong with it. To name a few things...

WALTER:
You wanna introduce a new Muppet? Fine. But there's no need for him to hijack the whole show. He had more screentime than all of the *real* Muppets combined. And he's not that interesting. His personality is at best a ""straight man"" like Scooter or Rowlf.

THE MUSIC:
A few numbers are good. But overall, it doesn't feel like Muppet music, or even a musical period. It just feels like another kid's movie trying hard to seem ""cool,"" with pop-songs, and a cliche rap-spoof.

CHARACTER DE-VOLUTION?
Because the Muppets have such a small role in their own movie, their personalities are left insultingly flat. Gonzo does some weird stunts with Camilla, and that's it; Fozzie acts stupid and tells lame jokes, and that's it; Kermit is cynical and must regain faith in his friends, just like in the first Muppet movie...and the second one...and the third one..........which reminds me of the other problem....

THE (LACK OF) PLOT:
You'll never guess what the plot of this movie is. Kermit has lost faith in the group, and forgotten friendship; but now the Muppets must put on a great show, to save their theater! Bet you never saw that plot before! Oh, but don't worry, there's more to the plot than that. There are a few very original sub-plots...like Jason Siegel neglecting his finance, or Walter wanting to fit in. Come on, guys. What made ""Great Muppet Caper,"" ""Muppet Treasure Island,"" and ""Muppet Christmas Carol"" so great was how they changed up the game for the Muppets every time. This ""save the theater"" rubbish is beyond cliche, it's insultingly lazy.

POSITIVE POINTS:
Here's what made me give this turkey three stars, instead of one:

* Gonzo's introductory scene, with the toilet factory, is epic.
* Animal's anger management class with Jack Black is also great
* Jack Black's kidnapping makes for one of the most hilarious Muppet Show guest-star plots ever
* ""Life's a Happy Song,"" and ""Man or a Muppet""
* '80s Robot is a good addition to the cast.
* Thought she's not terribly interesting, the character of Mary gets points for being played by the star of ""Enchanted""

VERDICT:
See the top of this review. It's watchable. I'd only watch the whole movie again if I was on another Muppet-binge, and wanted to watch *everything* Muppet related again.",1413936000,,2568,4.807256235827665

4341941,2,B004EPZ03O,"Let me start by saying that I love this movie.  I bought this particular Combo pack because it included the digital soundtrack and it was cheaper than buying the DVD and soundtrack separately.  When I attempted to claim my digital soundtrack from Disney I was told that all available soundtracks had been claimed.  I asked why the number of available soundtracks was less than the number of offers.  Disney responded by telling me that if I had wanted the soundtrack I should have redeemed the offer sooner.  I pointed out that the packaging does not state that the offer expires or that it is in limited supply.  I was then once again told that I should have turned in the offer sooner. I'm not sure how to turn in an offer sooner than the day I purchase the product, but apparently that is the only way to redeem for the soundtrack.  If all you are looking for is the movie than this may be a good buy for you.  If you are buying to get the movie and the included soundtrack, beware that Disney will not honor their promise of a digital soundtrack with this product; despite no stipulations being printed on the product packaging.

This is not what happened. I contacted Disney both by email and by phone and there was nothing their ""Fairy Godmothers"" (exact wording) could do. The code was expired and they didn't have another one.

4342195,5,B004EPZ03O,"Without a doubt, the Muppets still got it.  I wonder how much research Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller had to do to write this script...it definitely paid off big time and they must have fulfilled ten of their lifelong dreams.  This film brought back the Muppets we know and love while properly setting them in our modern society.  Moopet also stepped into the ""leading man's"" shoes alongside a brand-new Muppet named Walter, the two of them believable playing loving brothers...it'd have been more believable if they feuded now and again, but it's a Muppet movie.  A movie can never go wrong with casting Amy Adams, especially if there's singing involved, and this leading lady did not disappoint.  I did find her introduction scene a bit weird.  Yes, having her play a shop teacher made perfect sense down the line, but the students being disappointed about going on spring break was definitely far-fetched, even by the Muppets' standards.  Then again, if Amy Adams was my teacher...okay, I'll just keep it PG...let's move on.  Chris Cooper and his Muppet/Moopet minions were perfectly slimy and villainy and you'll love what happens with all of them in the end.  Like its predecessors, this film restricted using CGI effects as much as possible and instead gave us our beloved Muppets live and in color...and fur.  And you could never fault them for that, mainly because it worked just as well as it always has.  Whether this is your first Muppet movie or you're a long-time fan, this film will undoubtedly prove that the Muppets still got it...and let's take a moment and welcome Walter (applause.)

It was a great reboot to the Muppet franchise.  I loved the show, don't get me wrong but the movies always bored the heck out of me for some reason.  This one totally blew me away I wasn't expecting it.  Jason Segal was a blast.  My wife and son loved it too. We watched a bunch of times, never gets old.",1389657600,,467,4.157303370786517

I grew up in the 80's and watched the Muppets on Sunday night, so this movie brought back some wonderful memories and had some pretty funny lines. The best song is ""Muppet or a Man"" - with a nice cameo from Jim Parsons (Sheldon).

A fun family movie :) Great for those of us who remember and love the Muppets!",1388102400,,434,4.105882352941176

This film and its sweet storyline kept a smile permanently etched on my face from beginning to end. I love everything in this movie - the music, the dancing, the plots, the humor, the absolute genius that went into creating this movie. Jason Segel (Marshall from HIMYM) co-wrote and co-starred in this, and there were several cameos from other talented actors: Whoopi Goldberg, Emily Blunt, Segel's fellow HIMYM actor Neil Patrick Harris, Selena Gomez, Jim Parsons, Mickey Rooney...as well as others.

Even though a vast majority of the actors in this are puppets, they stir in you deep emotions that you can't help but feel. You will definitely be touched by their passion and perseverance, courage and camaraderie.

This is definitely something I will watch again. I was pleasantly surprised by The Muppets here, and I fell in love with Muppet magic all over again :)",1387065600,,1112,4.663265306122449

What others may miss is that this is a film with a lot of levels of comedy that manages to really work in every way to hit home.  There are some solid emotional down beats that just nail it.  'Pictures in My Head' is an A+ number, and 'Man or Muppet' is a blast.  This is a film that works for both young kids and adults.",1386979200,,379,3.883116883116883

That and the fact that it makes editorial comments about itself during the movie just kind of sucks, as well as the general sarcastic or smug tone in the whole thing just kinda speaks volumes about how far we've fallen in the modern age.  We took the innocence and courtesy of yesteryear as displayed in most (but not all) Muppet ventures and tainted it.  Why four stars, then, you ask?

We have certainly watched it several times already, and most likely will watch it stil more.

I was really pleased with this movie, and how it tastefully breathes new life into the old franchise. I was particularly pleased to see that this was not a ""reboot""- which is by far the easiest and most popular mannner by which old series are revisited. Rather, ""The Muppets"" continues the long running story, with all the characters having left the theater decades ago, now pursuing their own, weird lives in different parts of the country.

Most important of all, this movie successfully captures the laugh-out-loud good times for which the Muppets became famous. It starts out a little slow, but before long, I was clutching my sides with laughter as the movie delved into the bizarre with things such as the ""eighties robot"" and Tex Richman's elaborate way of declining business propositions (which includes a rap song and dancers busting out of his office closet). Jason Seagall and Amy Adams keep things ""human""  and heartfelt, propelling the movie along with their delightful song and dance numbers, such as the hilarious ""Me Party"".

Since then they have mostly stagnated with straight-to-DVD and TV movies. Someone at Disney reckoned a reboot was in order so now we have the unimaginatively-titled ""The Muppets"". I was surprised to see Jason Segal's name as a writer in the opening credits, and I had hopes that it would feel original and inspired rather than something made by a Disney committee.

They're just in the background with no decent story.

There were too many songs, a couple being completely superfluous. Despite the numerous cameos I just didn't feel that this movie had any star power. I longed for Michael Caine to show up and add some credibility to it. Sadly it was just too TV-ish, with many TV actors filling out the various parts. This ranks somewhere towards the bottom of the Muppets long list of movies, even beneath The Muppets Go Medieval starring Troy McClure.

The Blu-ray looks very good in 1.78:1 1080p with Jason Segel's many warts and moles offending my delicate eyes. The sound is in punchy DTS HD-MA 7.1 and there are a fair amount of extras.",1378339200,3,2169,6.035714285714286
4343188,5,B004EPZ03O,"The Muppets are back with a movie that went to movie theaters for the first time since 1999's Muppets From Space even through they did have a couple of made for TV movies. And you might also expect that the Muppets have broken up and are apart from each other. The movie also got its first Oscar for the song Man or a Muppet, which can be unbelievable as some from earlier movies you might have thought would have gotten, but maybe they were not worthy for them. The movie even has Amy Adams that was no near as famous as she is now the last time the Muppets had a movie that went to movie theaters. As the movie opens you see a character that looks like a Muppet named Walter (Peter Linz) growing up in Smalltown with his brother Gary (Jason Segel) and they grow up as high fans of the Muppets even with a tape of their old TV show. And now as adults Gary and his girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams) have now been a couple for 10 years, and as part of it he is taking her to Los Angeles for a vacation. And Walter sounds down about not getting to go, until Gary pulls a surprise  that he has got him a ticket to go too which includes a tour of the Muppets Studios. Mary works as a teacher at a school, that she is going on a 2 week spring break. And that begins when Gary picks her up for the trip. THen they take a bus to Los Angeles, which they hit to the first stop which is and you guessed it the Muppet Studios, where they met a short tour group which is led by Alan Arkin. The tour stops includes the outside of  Kermit's office, when nobody is looking Walter enters the office, and is hidden under a table, where he sees Statler and Waldorf selling the Muppets Studios to Tex Richman (Chris Cooper ) and his henchmen Bobo the Bear and Uncle Deadly, and even explains that if the Muppets can raise 10 million dollars, before their contract expires they can purchase back the Muppet Studios which includes the Muppet theater of where did their show from. And when they are gone, and when Tex Richman thinks that his and his henchman are alone, he explains to them ""there is oil under the theater, and his plan is to destroy the theater, and drill for it. Unaware that Walter is under the table, and overheard his plan, and he catches up with Gary and Mary and is still screaming about what he has heard. And now the plan is to find Kermit the Frog, and to tell them what Walter has heard. They do mange to find his house, which Walter faints when he sees me, and reawakens in his home. He tells him about the plan, and Kermit says the only thing can can be done is to get the Muppets back and do a show,  and that is what they do. They mange to get most of the Muppets back, expect for Miss Piggy and now starts looking at channels to present their show on, which all gets rejected until they met with CDE executive Veronica (Rashida Jones) which she says no at first, and shows them what is popular, and where they are on as far as poplar which is not a big precent. But she does give them a timeslot of Punch Teacher, when they suddenly walk out and she has nothing else to replace it with. But the big condition she gives to the Muppets is to find a celebrity guest host. That is all that I am going to revel, and I am going to leave it up to you to find out what will happen. But I would have loved it if the movie had explained, well first how are Walter and Gary are brothers since when is a human, and the other a Muppet, and just what did happen that led to the break up of the Muppets even if it could have been explained to where it doesn't take up  a lot of the story.",1377993600,,3577,4.076704545454546

I was ok with that but as I  watched  the movie several times it got stuck where I would have to try to fast forward past that spot by doing that it would get it moving again but I would miss some parts of the movie.

4343298,4,B004EPZ03O,"The 2011 rendition of The Muppets proved to be a successful one. Jason Segel is a great foil for these Muppets, while Walter himself is not a bad addition to the Muppets character lineup. The plot is easy to follow, and will hold everyone's attention spans for the running time (approx 1.75 hours). The only major complaint I have against the film is a really bad rap sequence somewhere in the middle that you'll know it when you see it. Fortunately, that's why there is a 'Skip' button on DVD or Blu-ray remotes. There are MANY great celebrity cameos which are a hallmark of Muppet movies. ""Pictures in my Head"" is one of these scenes that will make anyone of any age teary-eyed! I join in all the recommendations for this film.

The Muppets is one of the most enjoyable and soon-to-be-classic musicals available. Both Jason Segel & Amy Adams act up the cuteness just enough to be not sickeningly sweet and instead provide characters the audience can believe in surrounded by the lovable Muppets.  Kermit and the gang make a long-overdue return to the screen in top form.  The film's entire premise being the setup of The Muppets grand return from obscurity only adds to the humor and self-aware charm of the movie.

Disney pulled the download link off of their website, so if someone was planning on buying either of the two versions that include the soundtrack, you're probably wasting your money. At this time, the soundtrack versions are a much higher price than the non-soundtrack DVDs and that price difference seems to be for the soundtrack and digital copy.

4343502,2,B004EPZ03O,"Love the Muppets. Couldn't wait to see this one. Glad I did. Cute movie.

HOWEVER.

The DVD itself sucked.  The viewer is more or less forced into watching what seems like 20 minutes of commercials and trailers before you see the main menu.  (I say ""more or less"" because you have to make a rather ambiguous selection as soon as it starts, if you guess wrong, then you get commercials which are unskippable once started.)

Then, once you get to the menu, that's it.  No extras, no bloopers, trailers, behind the scenes, tributes to Jim Henson, or anything.  Apparently you have to buy the Blu-Ray for that? I'm not really sure, but as a huge fan of the Muppets, that was pretty disappointing.

However. The film itself was fun, lots of harmless double-entendres and cameos to keep the grownups happy, and songs and jokes for the kids too.  Lots of ""meta"" humor as well which I thought was fun.  Scenes like this in the beginning of the film: ""So, Kermit, do you think we can do it?""  ""No. Absolutely not.""  ""Wow, this is going to be a really short movie...""

Eh. Get it. Enjoy it. For $5 you can't go wrong with this version. For $20, it's a disappointment.",1361318400,3,1157,4.478468899521531

4343596,3,B004EPZ03O,"First, I should say that I've been a Muppet fan for umpteen years.  Jim Henson was a genius, and I miss his sly humor and creativity.  Kermit is still my hero.  That said, I have been looking forward to seeing this latest Muppet movie.  I really like Amy Adams (she was great in ""Enchanted""!)  On the positive side, I liked the story, liked seeing some of the older Muppets, and was glad to see/hear that Steve Whitmire is doing an admirable job (better than initially) as Kermit.  The cameos were fun, and Jack Black was a good choice to be starring with the Muppets.

I know that Muppet features are made to appeal to kids and adults, on different levels, which this accomplished, but not to the degree of the Henson era.  Maybe I was comparing this one too much with the original ""Muppet Movie,"" with its wonderful cameos and puns and special effects.  The only word I can think of to describe this feature is ""hokey.""  Yeah; I know it's supposed to be corny, and I expect (and enjoy) the corniness.  And there's probably a fine line between corny and hokey.  In my opinion, this movie crossed the line.  I miss the chemistry of Henson and Oz, and to me, you can definitely sense the difference between the original and current performers.  It was an OK movie to see once, but I probably won't watch it again.  I'll look forward to ""The Muppets....Again,"" though.",1359072000,2,1366,4.518367346938776

No.

I was not disappointed with the result.  The story line was good and solid, and most of the Muppet characters were present for the comeback.  Walter, the new main Muppet character, fit right in.

4343986,4,B004EPZ03O,"The Muppets is a fun trip of nostalgia for those of us who grew up with Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo and the rest of the Muppet Show.

The movie begins with Gary (Jason Segel) and his brother Walter (a muppet) who grow up as fans of the Muppets.  Of course, Gary grows into an adult and Walter stays his same ""muppet"" size.

As Gary plans a 10th Anniversary trip wtih his lovely girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams), they decide on a trip to Hollywood and Muppet Studio.  Walter is invited along the trip.  After arriving, the trio find the studio in decay and about to be taken over by an evil real estate tycoon (played by the brilliant Chris Cooper) unless the Muppets raise $10 million dollars.

Walter, Gary, and Mary set out to find the Muppets, reuniting them with several adventures and attempt to perform a reunion show to raise the cash.

The movie is a lot of fun, with many jokes and gags and guest cameo appearances.  These are especially humorous to those who remember the old Muppet Show on TV.

I'm not sure that younger viewers who have never seen the original program will get all the material and character interaction.

4344099,5,B004EPZ03O,"Ok, I have to admit, I was never a huge Muppet fan.  We lived in a small mountain area and only got one tv channel so I never saw the show, but I did enjoy the one movie they had at our local video store.  As an adult  I enjoyed Muppet Treasure Island and Muppet Christmas Carol.  I know, I know, I grew up in the 80s, but I just never saw it that much.

When my toddler got a stomach flu, I was looking for something to rent for him, something I would feel comfortable showing him without watching first myself.  I got this movie for him.  I wanted to see it myself too, and I was hoping the new Muppet movie wouldn't let me down.  It was a hit with the whole family.  My son is now a huge Kermit fan.  It helped keep his mind off his stomach and helped him relax, and it was a good introduction to the Muppets and also entertaining for adults who have already seen the Muppets.  Even though I didn't see a ton of the Muppets, it did bring back some memories, not just of the Muppets, but of the 80s too :)

I think this movie has a few things that could be thought of as inappropriate for young children, like Piggy punching another pig, and Piggy kidnapping someone.  It depends on what you are ok with letting your kids see.  I was worried the ending with the bad guy might be a little scary, but my toddler seemed fine through it.  It is all done with the usual Muppet silliness, but I wasn't sure a toddler would get that.

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  Seems like a great family film, and it is hard to find movies the whole family will enjoy together.",1354060800,,1581,4.09771986970684

While there, he overhears the evil plot of oil baron Tex Richman (Chris Cooper), who is planning to take over the studio and destroy it for the oil that lies underneath.  The only way out is to raise $10 million . . . and soon.  Walter purposes to reunite the Muppets for a fund-raising telethon to save the studio and thereby the Muppet legacy.  Can they raise the money in time?  Or does no one care anymore about the Muppets?

This movie has it all--sympathetic characters, action, comedy, romance and musical numbers.  And it all works.  Particularly hilarious are the multiple times that the actors ""break the fourth wall"" and speak directly to the audience about the movie.  An extensive number of cameos by well-known actors round out the fun.

Critics were pleased as well.  Rotten Tomatoes gives it an impressive 96% rating.  With this film, Segel has successfully reinvigorated the Muppet franchise.  A sequel has already been announced.

The blu-ray transfer is top-notch.  Audio and visual are both strong.  Colors are vibrant, and the sound is clear.  The disc contains a number of special features, which are all listed in the product description above.

I highly recommend The Muppets for all ages.  It is a ""must see.""  More movies like this, please.",1352592000,,1697,4.873684210526315

4344189,5,B004EPZ03O,"I very seldom take the time to write a review for a movie but this one just had me screaming to put down my words.  I was a huge muppet fan as a kid.  I watched the show every week.  From the spinning ribbon on the TV right before Kermitt appeared in the O until the last note was played I would not move away from the TV.
I had been hesitant about watching the movie as I was truly worried that it would not live up to my expectations and everything that the Muppets will always be to me in my heart.  I am so sorry I waited so long.  Yesterday while at home with my 18 month old daughter hunkering down and waiting out Hurricane Sandy we watched the movie.  At first it seemed like just a fun loving movie that reminded me of many of the reasons I loved the Muppet Show.  My daughter was tough to keep entertained at frist (but again she is 18 months old) but she sat and played and watched and played.  Then it happened and I cound not stop the tears coming to my eyes.  Just as they started the portion of the movie where they put on the show and you see Kermit ready to open the door to the O and that all to familiar music started.  It was like I was back in my parents house sitting in the living room watching our little TV and loving every minute.  What made it even more special was watching my daughter dance to the open credits, or how she laughed and jumped around when the cluck cluck trio started singing.
I will admit that there were times I wondered if some of the cheese of the supporting story might have been a bit much but the more I watched the movie the more I felt like it was perfect.  It clearly shows that this movie was made with the same love of the Muppets that so many of us have from childhood and it is exactly what was needed.  Anything less would not have been as moving.
Thank you for showing me a piece of my childhood that I am even more exicted about sharing with my daughter.  This movie showed me how much I truly wish they would bring back the Muppet show.  Our kids need the fun and wholesome entertainment and this movie truly shows you just that.",1351555200,,2091,4.065853658536585

A tip of the hat to the lead human performers Jason Segel and Amy Adams who catch just the right note of real emotion, mixed with a friendly
wink at the audience so that we care, but it never feels sappy.

4344512,4,B004EPZ03O,"The Muppets have always been a curious relic of a bygone era of entertainment, much like Bugs Bunny and the rest of the Looney Tunes gang.  They still carry the torch for vaudeville, only in the case of the Muppets it's a show about putting on a show.  The ""Muppet Show"" regularly broke the fourth wall in a way that only stage performers can, but that meta-awareness has since become rote in the age of hyper-media saturation. Can the Muppets still be relevant in the Internet era?

""The Muppets"" wisely doesn't try to update the titular puppets so much as resurrect them, reintroducing Kermit (Steve Whitmire) and company in a ""get the gang back together to save the show"" plot.  It works, because it's the Muppets, and cheesy is what they do.

Less successful are the dual narratives at the center of the film.  Gary (Jason Segel) and Walter (Peter Linz) are brothers with one important difference: Gary is a human and Walter is a Muppet.  Gary has grown up and has a girlfriend Mary (adorable Amy Adams, who looks like she was pregnant through most of the film).  Walter has...his obsession with the Muppets.  These two worlds are destined to collide on a fateful road trip Hollywood.

The abandoned Muppet studio is in a sorry state, and it soon becomes clear that Kermit and Miss Piggy (Eric Jacobson) have broken up. With the rest of the Muppets scattered, it's up to our heroes to convince Kermit to reunite with his beloved, get the band back together (literally), and put on a show that will raise $10 million before villainous oil baron Tex Richman (Chris Cooper) can get his hands on the plot.

What ensues is a series of madcap homages to other films, subtle references to Muppet canon, and lots of plot-bending gags like ""traveling by map."" These jokes aren't so much funny as they are ironic, which is what the Muppet always excelled at.  Jack Black, playing himself, demonstrates the brilliance of the Muppets when Fozzie Bear (Eric Jacobson) begins a lame routine and Black reacts by mocking him.  The audience eats it up, and we do too - not because the Muppets are always funny, but because they're always game, often lame, and in on the joke.

Different plot points resolve at their own pace, and to Segel's writing credit, almost all of them resolve in a satisfactory fashion.  Villains are defeated, romances rekindled, and our beloved Muppets play all the songs we remember best.  The funniest gags comes from a new Muppet, 80's Robot (Matt Vogel), who is there exclusively to keep us Gen Xers entertained.

Unfortunately the weakest link is central to the film.  Walter is a generic Muppet with almost no character development other than his adoration of Kermit. When he is called upon in the eleventh hour to find his talent, it feels as fabricated as his body.

But I can't be too harsh on the Muppets.  Although the movie's not really for kids, the secret to the Muppets was that it never was.  This is the best resurrection a fan could ask for.",1344729600,,2972,4.666026871401152

4344514,4,B004EPZ03O,"I got this DVD purely as I am a fan of Jason Segel, as well as quite a few of the modern TV shows that I knew had actors in cameo roles in this movie. I was a fan of the Muppets as a kid, although the fresh spin off show was Fraggle Rock (there was also a cartoon with the Muppets in diapers), The Muppet Show itself was well and truly into the rerun stage by my childhood, and some of the Muppet characters, especially the band, were sort of like they portray them all in this a film, a bit dated, but I still liked and enjoyed watching The Muppet Show. Plus there was the odd movie out on video or on TV every now and then when I was growing up.

So I found this a nice nostalgic trip, where when each different Muppet would appear, I would remember a scene from the TV show or their other movies such as Sweetums picking up and eating a girl with her legs kicking as she went down his mouth. That's a good thing about this movie, there's heaps of characters, so you do get to see them all. However this is also a bad thing as other than Kermit (and Walter the new Muppet of course), in an effort to fit them all into the movie none of the characters really have much air time. I don't remember in any detail but I'm pretty sure the other movies concentrated on say a group of ten Muppets (Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo, Rowlf and Animal plus maybe a couple of others) for most of the plot, with a lot of action and dialogue between the core group, with the other Muppets just having cameos or being in the group scenes. That's not the case here, this film doesn't really have much of a plot at all, it's a just a really basic skeleton plot of a couple taking a holiday to LA, where the girl hopes her ten year relationship boyfriend will finally propose and ultimately spend more time with her and less time with his brother. Unfortunately for her, he has bought an extra bus ticket for Walter, the brother who is obsessed with The Muppets. So of course they have to visit the old studios. By trespassing where he shouldn't be, the brother learns the ownership of the studios is about to be acquired by an evil oil man who wants demolish the place and drill for oil. The Muppets have a couple of days to raise 10 million dollars or ownership goes to him. Problem is the Muppets have all moved on with their lives, no one seems to care but Walter with the help of his brother and brother's girlfriend are determined to make them care and one by one come out of retirement and do a one off show to raise the cash.

The overly simple plot and constant introduction of new characters works for an audience who are familiar with all the characters and have memories from their childhood. I don't know though that it has enough substance for a new generation of kids unfamiliar with these particular puppets to get much out of it, or to make them want to know and see more, as a lot of the funny lines are the characters making fun of the past, or the subtle references to the sexual harassment by Miss Piggy on Kermit and things like this which aren't in this film. Incidentally it hasn't been diluted totally from the show that it was on TV by the PC movement. (There's some plot spoilers here if you haven't seen it yet) Piggy does jump another Muppet taking him to the floor in a giant hug to make Kermit uncomfortable and leave her dressing room if he doesn't want to watch them doing that act, when he had gone in there to beg her to move on from their past and perform a duet on stage with him. She also brutally assaults another pig who they have employed to perform her part when she changes her mind and now wants to be a part of the show after the other pig tells Miss Piggy too bad, she's now doing the part. Gonzo also murders all his employees for no apparent reason instead of simply selling the business and negating the whole need for the fund raiser concert.

The cameo actors don't for the most part have many if any lines which is a bit disappointing, they are also from mostly adult of TV sitcoms such as Community, Big Bang Theory, Modern Family and How I Met Your Mother so kids of the age the Muppets target market is probably won't be that familiar with them so may get no enjoyment from seeing them on the screen at all simply because they don't know who they are.
Jason Segel the main human character (Gary) pretty much plays the same character he does on How I Met Your Mother and every movie he's been in so far throughout his career. Amy Adams (Mary) plays the neglected girlfriend, including performing a few choreographed musical type numbers such as Me Party extremely well. There's a few catchy new songs in this movie such as Life's a Happy Song and Man or Muppet done well by Segel, Adams and the Muppet voice actor singers, as well as few classics from past movies designed to help with the recall of memory flow such as Rainbow Connection.

The movie's villain and the other main human actor Tex Richman is a bit tacky and a cliche. There needed to be some sort of motivation besides being an oil man to give his actions in wanting to wipe the Muppets history for the modern day some substance. A childhood flashback where Kermit or some Muppet ran over his dog or something to motivate him down his path of hate. I also found Walter's special talent to be pretty average after it was being built up throughout a large portion of the movie.

What was really entertaining is the special feature The Longest Blooper Reel Ever Made, where the Muppets are playing their non character fictional actors stuffing up lines and interacting with each other. I guess I liked this so much because it was so much fresher, original and different to what the movie itself was going for.
On its own this movie is unlikely to bring The Muppets a fresh generation of fans who have Shrek, Toy Story and other franchises to compete for their entertainment. In short if you're old enough to have grown up with the Muppets, you'll enjoy this trip down memory lane, although I don't know how many times you'll watch the DVD again in the future, which you may have if it had a plot with a bit more meat to it.",1344297600,,6124,4.298701298701299

I've been a Muppet fan since the day I first saw them as a child. I can remember sitting around watching The Muppet Show and just having such a good time. It's one of the fondest memories I have of my childhood.

The Muppets have been out of the limelight FAR too long.

We the fans HAVE MISSED THEM.

But now they are back. AND BACK WITH PURPOSE!

Thank you to all who made this movie happen... it felt like a Muppet movie and it was AWESOME. I cried at the end cause I felt that it finally did the Muppets the justice they so rightly deserve.

See this movie. I won't ruin anything for you. Just see it. If you are a Muppet fan, you have to see this... you have to own it.

4344536,4,B004EPZ03O,"Growing up on a healthy dose of The Muppets, I was so excited when I heard that Jason Segel was heading a revamp of the franchise.  It was like the little boy inside of me jumped for joy at the very thought of seeing one of these films through fresh eyes.  I told my daughter that I was taking her to see this film and she stared at me with this blank expression and uttered four words that stuck a dagger in my soul.

""Who are The Muppets?""

What has happened to children's entertainment?  Why are they fed nonsense in such an ingratiating manner, and if Sesame Street can survive, why have The Muppets all but died off?  I blame myself for not being assertive enough to force feed my daughter the shows I grew up on, and yet times have changed and I'm really busy!  Still, I was going to educate her, and so I thank Jason Segel for making my job a little easier.  I swooped up my daughter, called up my friend (who happens to have fathered her best friend) and we made our way to the local cinema for a daddy/daughter Muppet extravaganza.

Totally worth it.

My initial reaction after leaving the theater was one of unbridled glee.  I was in love with this movie.  From the moment Segel and company burst into song, dancing through the streets in brightly clad attire, I was brought back to my youth (early youth) and I honestly wanted to get up and dance.  I was so happy when my little angel actually did!  The film follows a little Muppet named Walter who grew up in a human house with his brother and best friend Gary.  When Walter and Gary learn that an oilman wants to destroy Muppet Theater in order to drill for oil, they set off to prevent that from happening.  Along the way, Walter finds his place in life, which is something he's struggled with growing up, never truly feeling at home even when he was at home.

The way that the characters are explored here is fun and fresh, and Segel has fun integrating common movie clich&eacute;s in a way that is bright and humorous (as a way at poking fun at the typical rom-com).  There is so much joy in this film.  Upon reflection though, I have to admit that I was a tad let down by the finale.  I was waiting with baited breath for the actual `show' and when they finally put it one I was left wanting.  Sure, not at the moment (because, while in the moment, I was lapping it all up) but later as I thought about it, and when I saw it a second time, I was left with this feeling of disappointment, albeit slight.  The musical numbers were maybe too modern (clucking `Forget You' was a bit meh in my opinion) and it just didn't last long enough.

That said, the original songs (including the Oscar winning `Muppet or a Man') are delicious and Chris Cooper is hilarious as the villain, Tex Richman.

4344539,5,B004EPZ03O,"What can I say? I have loved the Muppets since I was a little kid. Jim Henson had this amazing gift of intertwining absurdity and tear-jerking sentimentality. Because of this, I was enthusiastic but a bit nervous when I walked into the theater to see this modern exploration of Henson's style. Sure, others have had varying levels of success at channeling ol' Jim since Brian Henson first undertook the huge task of filling his dad's shoes and directing ""The Muppet Christmas Carol"" back in '92. However, since a bit of time had passed since the heyday of the Muppets, I knew that the director, writers, actors and Muppeteers would have to plan carefully in order to craft something that reaches modern audiences without abandoning Jim Henson's vision. ""If they succeed at selling the Muppets today,"" I thought, ""My future kids will get a chance to see new Muppet productions in their own lifetime rather than knowing the Muppets as an old classic.""

I couldn't have imagined a better outcome.

I had high hopes for Amy Adams after I saw her embodiment of a displaced princess in ""Enchanted,"" and she certainly didn't disappoint in ""The Muppets,"" either. However, I didn't know much about Jason Segel, so I wasn't sure what to expect from his acting or writing. Much to my pleasure, though, he played fantastically alongside the Muppets, never overshadowing them in a way that turned them into mere puppets. (His ""Man or Muppet"" duet with Walter/Sheldon from ""The Big Bang Theory"" deservedly won an Oscar!) I was also thrilled to see that, true to Henson form, ""The Muppets"" included both kid-friendly humor for the little ones and subtle grown-up humor for adults who just took their kids to see the movie. And, as a lifelong Muppets enthusiast, I was pleased with the sprinkling of throwbacks like ""Mah-na Mah-na"" and ""The Rainbow Connection."" Knowing that these old favorites are going to be a normal part of modern kids' ""Jersey Shore""-filled lives fills me with profound gratitude for the Jim Henson Company and for everyone else who was motivated to shine the spotlight back upon Kermit, Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo, Statler, Waldorf, Beaker, Bunsen, and the rest of the gang.",1341187200,,2175,4.923705722070845

I used to watch The Muppet Show regularly, and loved the first movie (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Muppet-Movie/dp/B000ATQYTM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Muppet Movie</a>).  The Muppets manage to produce a blend of entertainment that is funny and engaging (and appropriate) for kids, while having another layer that makes it equally entertaining for adults.

For example, in this new installment, during one of the opening song and dance numbers, the crowd of singing/dancing people and Muppets move down a backlot city street, and they pass a hippy who looks very much like Willie Nelson, who pipes up to sing the word ""high"" in the song.

Now, for our toddler daughter this meant nothing (other than a funny looking guy singing), but my wife and I cracked up.

Similarly, during the finale when the Muppets are putting on a show, there is a number performed solely by chickens, and it's a cover of Cee Lo Green's song 'Forget You'.  Sung by chickens.  Chickens who cluck.  As in, cluck you, which is remarkably close to the uncensored version of that song.

Again, that will fly over younger kid's heads, but I had to pause the movie and LOL for a bit, then rewind and see it again.  Classic Muppet stuff.

And it's not just about the subversive bits, or the cameos, either.  The film feels true to the sensibilities of the Muppets, and, frankly, I've been worried about them becoming assimilated by Disney and turned into...well, who knows what, but not what they were.  I am happy (and thankful to Disney) to report that these are the Muppets, as we know and love them, updated for today's audiences but without losing their character or personalities.",1339372800,,1732,5.124555160142349

I recall watching a few of the movies and The Muppet Babies cartoon series, but I have lost touch with these cute characters. I remember seeing this movie advertise at the theater last year and I thought it would be horrible due to the fact that Jason Segel is in it. Surprisingly, I wasn't annoyed with his character, even though it is unbelievable that Amy Adams' character actually liked him. All the Muppet characters are back, but some of them could have had more screen time, like Fozzie Bear - who didn't have much to do. The movie is cute for kids with enough humor for adults to enjoy it as well.",1338940800,,708,4.412213740458015

4344650,4,B004EPZ03O,"Muppets are back on screen. Well, they have come back not in the way I wanted, though. The new Muppet film remains enjoyable throughout, but sometimes two human characters Gary (Jason Segel) and his sweetheart Mary (Amy Adams) almost dominate ""The Muppet"" that should belong to Jim Henson characters.

The story is basically about Gary, Mary and Gary's ""brother"" Walter ... and Walter is a Muppet, who is a big fan of the original Muppet show. The three travel to Hollywood, where they learn that Kermit, Miss Piggy and other Muppet characters are not popular anymore. To protect their Muppet Studio from the greedy billionaire, the three travelers and Kermit plan to organize a show once again with other Muppet character to raise the money.

With Gary, Mary and Walter as the main characters, the script (by Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller) does not give much time for each Muppet character to shine. Chris Cooper plays ""Tex Richman,"" a villain attempting to sabotage the show. I am a fan of Chris Cooper, but with all respect he is hardly the right choice for the comedic role.

But to me the biggest problem of ""The Muppets"" is the key concept of the film - people have forgotten the Muppets. But do they? Or do we? The self-referential jokes are refreshing at first, but soon they get tired simply because we just don't buy the idea. With special appearances of guest stars including jack Black, ""the Muppets"" is a joyful ride, but it could have been much better with less humans and more Muppets.",1338768000,,1503,4.729007633587786

There were also several unbelievable parts (for example there being millions of dollars of oil under the Muppets Studio in LA, and a dues ex machina ending where the evil character has a change of heart), but let's face it, this is a Muppet movie and no one expects an interesting or complex realistic story. I did however, have some problems with the musical numbers. Most of the new songs mainly featured the mediocre humans (even though I love Jason Segel), with the Muppets everyone loves either not being featured at all or only as cameos. Then most of the musical numbers that did feature the main Muppets were rehashed Classics, which while I still love and elicit fond memories, I can experience the higher quality versions (with the original voices) when I watch the older Muppet movies.

Still, it was great to see the Muppets in action again, and I'm happy that today's young generation now has their own Muppet movie to watch.",1338249600,,1256,4.632286995515695

So many subtle references (Barber shop quartet-Nirvana) to cross generational gaps as well as many cameos recognized by young and old (Jack Black, Whoopi Goldberg, Selena Gomez, Neil Patrick Harris). I'm in my mid-twenties and I loved it. Very well done.

I also loved that there was Chinese in the movie. I was disappointed that Disney didn't include a complete translation on the blu-ray, considering it is coded for all regions, ABC. I really wish Studios would start including more language options. I know it gets translated into more than just French and Spanish, why not include those other languages? The Smurfs had like 14 different language choices, but I digress.

The music is superb!! Sometimes you find songs in musicals that just slow things down, but The Muppets never lost my interest. The songs pulled me further into the movie.

Kermit, as their leader, never assumes you still adore him; rather, he keeps giving you reasons to find him lovable, and he thanks you for that. And these furry beings don't behave (as many Disney creations do) as if it's still the 1960s. They know their time and potential untimeliness, and they work hard to overcome the generation gaps that make so many other former favorites obsolete.

This is a movie that pokes as much fun at itself as possible, and it's all the more endearing because of how conscious it is of how unendearing it could have been.

4344930,5,B004EPZ03O,"(Originally posted on The Absentee Blogger)

I finally had the chance to watch the new Muppet movie this past weekend. Yes, I am a life-long Muppet fan. Yes, I cried profusely. It made me think a lot, remembering my own childhood and part of the reasons why I am what I am today. I considered doing a review, but realized my feelings were more personal than a normal review would allow. Instead, I decided to do a mock letter to Jason Segel, who made the movie what it was. So, without further ado, my take on The Muppets.

Dear Mr. Segel,

I'm sure you have heard this countless times from every fan who has watched The Muppets movie, but I am, without a doubt, Walter. I danced to the theme song before I could even walk and watched religiously every week. Once we owned a VCR, my dad was forced to tape every episode and many of those tapes still survive today, albeit worn out and fuzzy from the years. Whenever I was asked what I was going to be when I grew up, my answer was I would be on the Muppet Show.

The most traumatic episode of my young life came when I was 9 years old and my father told me Jim Henson had passed away. I was crushed. All my dreams were gone. While it was true there were several attempts to resurrect the Muppets over the interceding 20 years, they felt like the Moopets masquerading under the Muppet name. Something was always missing, the important elements that made them something more.

I'll freely admit, I was skeptical when I heard you were going to give it another go. Why can't they just leave what's left of my childhood memories alone? My husband was willing to give you the benefit of the doubt and talked me into watching. I want to thank him for believing in you when I had given up and to you for making me love the Muppets again.

You have captured perfectly the frustration every fan has felt over the past two decades. The sadness of 'our' Muppets disappearing to be replaced by what executives think we want. Muppets that had turned to crassness to cover the lost chemistry. All of us have been searching for the Kermit we knew and loved, suddenly absent from our lives and entertainment. You found him and brought him and the whole gang back.

While it's true they now have to 'start from scratch' to rebuilt their audience among younger viewers, the real Muppets have never been forgotten by their fans. They inspired us to dream and believe. To act silly and enjoy life. Most of all, they taught us that if a pig and a frog can fall in love, a bear can tell jokes and a Gonzo can gather fans through 'performance art,' anything is possible.

Normally I don't get so emotionally invested in movies. After all, they're only entertainment for a short period of time. This was more for me. It awoke every childhood memory. It made me believe in my dreams again. Thank you.

From one Muppet fan to another, you did just what you set out to do.",1337558400,,2894,4.374301675977653

4344932,4,B004EPZ03O,"Let's face it, even an old cynical geezer like myself has to like The Muppets, even if they were never a daily staple.  Writer and star Jason Segel clearly puts the characters in an exalted place with this lovely reunion.  He plays Gary, from Smalltown, USA where he grew up along with his ""brother,"" a Muppet who doesn't know it, named Walter.  His longtime girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams, who perfected her song and dance role in 2007's ""Enchanted"") is eager to spend some alone-time with Gary but relents when he takes along Walter to a trip to The Muppet Studio.  When they get there, they find it in total disrepair and pledge to find Kermit in an effort to put the group back together again.

The studio is about to be acquired by an evil investor named Tex Richman (Chris Cooper) unless the gang can raise $10 million.  The film is lightweight fare of course but there is no denying the affection for Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo and the rest.  There are enough jokes for the adults to appreciate and enough of a message to instill in the youngsters.  The film is laden with cameos including Zach Galifianakis, Jim Parsons, Dave Grohl (Foofighters), James Carville, Selena Gomez, Neil Patrick Harris, and many others.  Unfortunately the music isn't anything special but can be overlooked given the character's enthusiasm.  This is a beautifully constructed film, the whole family can enjoy.

My 3 year old little boy runs around the hosue singing the songs from this movie to himself.

4345238,4,B004EPZ03O,"This relaunch of the Muppets was obviously a trip down nostalgia lane. I think by and large it succeeds. The film sets up a clever way to get the Muppets back together, both acknowledging their long absence and making a story out of it. The villains and story seem like they could have come out of the 1980s classics. Best of all, we get some of the Muppets' classic humor, including breaking the 4th wall. If I had one disappointment, it was with the human actors. Jason Segal is relatively new, but Amy Adams I'd always loved for her unbridled energy and enthusiasm. However, they're mostly used in the song and dance numbers. In fact, I think the movie tried to do too much by forcing their love drama into the movie along with all of the other plot elements. Still, overall I hope this movie does bring the Muppets back to prime time and that we see more of our favorite green frog.",1336262400,,886,4.408536585365853

4345240,5,B004EPZ03O,"It all began back in 1954.

A high school student named Jim Henson was working at WTOP-TV and creating puppets for a children's show known as ""The Junior Morning Show"".  Henson would continue making puppets as a Freshman at the University of Maryland, College Park as the teenager would go on to create the financially successful show ""Sam and Friends"" for WRC-TV.  The five minute show would feature a prototype of a character known as ""Kermit the Frog"".

This would lead to Henson working on a public television children's shown known as ""Sesame Street"" in the late '60s where Kermit the Frog would appear as a news reporter.

This would lead to Jim Henson creating a British/American television show known as ""The Muppets"" which premiered in 1976 and a total of five series were produced until March 1981 and lasting 120 episodes.  The show known for its parodies and slapstick would feature many celebrity guests and through the series, Jim Henson and Frank Oz would create additional characters to join Kermit the Frog such as Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Scooter, Gonzo, the Swedish Chef, Rowlf the Dog, Dr. Bunsen Honeydew, Beaker, the band Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem, Camilla the Chicken, Sam the Eagle, Statler and Waldorf, Link Hogthrob, Rizzo the Rat and many more.

Although the television series ended, ""The Muppets"" would continue in the big screen with ""The Muppet Movie"" (1979), ""The Great Muppet Caper"" (1981), ""The Muppets Take Manhattan"" (1984), ""The Muppet Christmas Carol"" (1992), ""Muppet Treasure Island"" (1996) and ""Muppets from Space"" (1999).

While a musical telefilm was created in 2005 titled ""The Muppets' Wizard of Oz"", the masses have not seen ""The Muppets"" for a long time and the last film was back in 1999.  Many have felt the characters have run its course and it was over, while others felt that without Jim Henson (who passed away in 1990), it would be difficult to continue ""The Muppets"" legacy.

In 2008, actor Jason Segel (""How I Met Your Mother"", ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"") and writer/filmmaker Nicholas Stoller (""Fun with Dick and Jane"", ""Get Him to the Greek"", ""Yes Man"") wanted to bring back the Muppets and so the two pitched the concept to Walt Disney and next thing you know, the film would be greenlighted and filmmaker James Bobin (""The Flight of the Conchords"", ""Da Ali G Show"") would directed, while Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller would be responsible for writing (Segel would also star in the film).

Cast alongside Jason Segel would be Amy Adams (""The Fighter"", ""Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian"", ""Julie & Julia"", ""Enchanted"") and Chris Cooper (""American Beauty"", ""The Bourne Identity"", ""Adaptation"") as the antagonist.  The film would also feature talents such as Jack Black, Rashida Jones, Alan Arkin, Zach Galifianakis, Ken Jeong, Jim PArsons, Kristen Schaal, Eddie Pepitone, Sarah Silverman, Donald Glover, Emily Blunt, Leslie Feist, Whoopi Goldberg, Selena Gomez, Neil Patric Harris, Judd Hirsch, Kohn Krasinski, Mickey Rooney and more.

The film would receive positive reviews from film critics and would be a success at the box office making over $158 million.  And now, ""The Muppets"" will be released on Blu-ray and DVD in March 2012.

VIDEO:

""The Muppets"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1).  The film looks absolutely fantastic on Blu-ray.  You can literally see the detail in the fur of the Muppets, to the skin pores of the human talent.  The clarity, the detail and the beautiful colors featured throughout the film are vibrant and because the film utilizes a lot of color, reds and greens really do pop.  Skintones are natural and black levels are nice and deep.

I didn't see any banding or artifacts, if anything, videophiles should be happy with the overall picture quality is flawless!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

I absolutely love how Disney is focusing on 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio lossless soundtracks.  As expected from this film that utilizes so much music, dialogue and music is crystal clear coming through the center and front channels.  There is good use of surround channels as well from the audience of the live show to the music being utilized.

The soundtrack is absolutely immersive, especially panning from varying sides coming from the surround channels (especially during the fireworks scene). Also, the LFE is used during scenes of accidents and there is also a good amount of ambiance that utilizes the surround channels as well.  I was pretty impressed as even when the scenes are shown backstage, you can then hear the audience still in the background from the rear or surround channels, you can hear the flickering of the lights to even when one gets on the stage.

Like the video, audiophiles will enjoy this lossless soundtrack because it is equally flawless and no hissing or any audio problems were detected at all.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""The Three Musketeers"" comes with the following special features:

  Disney Intermission - Groundbreaking Blu-ray feature. Pausing a movie will never be this much fun, as the Muppets take over the screen every time you stop the disc!  Whenever you pause, you get an intermission with music, audio from the Muppets, or the Muppets themselves showing up on screen or even a theater like look at the special features.
  Scratching The Surface: A Hasty Examination of the Making of Disney's ""The Muppets."" - (15:56) Hosted by unit production manager monster J.G., the cast and crew take a behind the scenes look at making Muppet and movie history.

  Explaining Evil: The Full Tex Richman Song -(2:38) This is the longer rap sequence featuring Tex Richman which goes into details of why he dislikes the Muppets.

The three discuss the movie but also joke around a lot during the commentary as well.  It would have been great to feature another commentary track with the puppeteers and crew, to give a more in-depth commentary on the making of the film.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I was among the many kids who grew up watching ""The Muppets"".  In fact, back in junior high and my earlier years of high school, watching the show every Monday through Friday was like an addictive ritual before heading off to school.

But like many children who grew up with ""The Muppets"", I got older and ""The Muppets"" became nothing more but a memory of my childhood and early teenage years.

So, when I first heard of ""The Muppets"" making a return to the big screen and that Jason Segel and Nick Stoller were involved in rejuvenating the franchise, I have to admit that I was a bit of a skeptic.

In today's society, Saturday and Sunday morning children shows are a rarity, even during the afternoons, you can't find anything.  Today's children to young adult series have been replaced by real characters and if there was any form of puppetry, it has long since disappeared from television and video games and the Internet have now become sources for children's entertainment.

""The Muppets"" have become nothing more but a memory for those of us who were able to watch the series while younger.  So, I had no idea what I would think about the film.  Especially having seen a variety of shows that I grew up with such as ""The Transformers"", ""G.I. Joe"", ""The Smurfs"" all receiving movie adaptations, ""The Muppets""...how can they attract today's audience?

So, I watched this film with my nine-year-old son.  His familiarity with Kermit the Frog would probably be from our Christmas ritual of watching ""Emmet Otter's Jugband Christmas"" (and due to licensing, Kermit the Frog has since been removed from later DVD releases) but together we watched and I was touched by the storyline of Walter.

The character represents the child inside many of us who grew up and was captivated by these characters, but unlike Walter, I stopped watching the series and for the last 20-years, I forgot about them.

So, I was touched by seeing the character of Walter wanting to reunite the Muppets but also captivated once again by the camaraderie and the music.  From the opening song of ""The Muppet Theme"" and even hearing ""Rainbow Connection"", I had nothing but a smile on my face because it was like returning to the days of my youth.  I admit, I probably laughed much more than my child because of my familiarity with the characters but we both enjoyed this film immensely and the additional cameos also added to the excitement.

Also, Jason Segel and Amy Adams brought a warmth to this film that was enjoyable, humorous and so much fun!  Sure, the musical segments may seem corny to some, but in the sense of how things relate to ""The Muppets"" and the quirkiness and craziness of the show, the musical numbers were perfect.  In fact, I have to say that I really enjoyed the music and the overall soundtrack.  For me, having grown up with the film, just to hear ""Rainbow Connection"" was quite sentimental as I have not heard Kermit the Frog sing that song since I was a child.

Also, another positive that I found with this film is that it's a childrens film that doesn't have to utilize the latest in technology.

In this day and age of CG graphics and technology, despite the characters being puppets, each character still retains their personality and watching them today, it still hasn't grown old to me.  I've read that Pixar helped out in the storyline department, and if that is indeed the case, you do get some of that Pixar-style sentimental scenes included in the film.  From brotherly relationships, dysfunctional relationships and of course, those who may have wondered what happened between Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy is featured in this film.

And while Jim Henson is no longer with us, nor is Frank Oz involved in voicing the characters any longer,  it does help that the voices today don't sound too different from the original voices.  Eric Jacobson, David Goelz, Bill Barretta, David Rudman and Matt Vogel do a wonderful job with the voice acting for this film.

But everything came together for this film, a script that touches upon nostalgia but also an appealing, captivating story for the young and old and a wonderful film that will entertain the multiple generations who experienced ""The Muppets"" on television and film.

As for this Blu-ray release of ""The Muppets: The Wocka Wocka Value Pack"", you get a Blu-ray, DVD, Digital Copy plus a downloadable soundtrack.  But for Blu-ray enthusiasts, this film looks absolutely fantastic in HD, and the immersive lossless audio soundtrack is equally impressive.  This is a magnificent Blu-ray release if you are fans of ""The Muppets"".

Overall, ""The  Muppets"" is a film that I enjoyed a lot.  For so long my friends have told me to watch it, but part of me rolled my eyes and felt, it was a part of my life a long time ago and I don't know if I can get into talking puppets ever again.  I was wrong.

I watched this film with my son and we both enjoyed it a lot.  For him, it was because of its crazy characters, the crazy antics and storyline.  For me, deep inside...I was happy because I can easily remember those times of watching ""The Muppets"" everyday and it was one thing for me to enjoy this as a child, but now to enjoy it as a father with my children and knowing friends who are also sharing it with their children or grandchildren makes me happy, because it's one thing from our past that a newer generation of fans can enjoy.

""The Muppets"" was definitely a crazy, entertaining and fun film.  The musical elements, the characters and the overall storyline worked perfectly.  Was there anything I didn't like?  Not really, but aside from the quacking chickens to the music of Cee Lo Green's ""Forget You"", I felt the film was entertaining and fun!  Granted, It all depends on one's appreciation for ""The Muppets"", otherwise if you never liked them to begin with, not sure if that's going to change your opinion today.

While I don't know what will happen to ""The Muppets"" from here on in, I will say that the James Bobin, Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller got this film right.  Looking back at the past Muppets films, a lot of them were kitsch and really going downhill.  Because the familiarity of the Muppets are primarily with its older viewers, Segel and Stoller realize that, as they are fans themselves and wanted a film that can appeal to both young and old, like Pixar films.  And they succeeded.

So for those who are wondering about this film, what I can tell you is that ""The Muppets"" is a fantastic family film that the younger generation and the older fans can really appreciate. And with this awesome Blu-ray release with wonderful PQ, AQ which is bundled with plenty of enjoyable special features (plus the Blu-ray, DVD and digital copy) plus an entertaining soundtrack, makes the ""The Muppets: The Wocka Wocka Value Pack"" release worth owning.

""The Muppets: The Wocka Wocka Value Pack"" is highly recommended!",1336176000,,15967,4.75309992706054

4345243,3,B004EPZ03O,Needed better choreography or at least more complex choreography.  The best part was the Muppet Show towards the end of the movie.  The movie suffered from a bad script/story up until that point.  The whole human/muppet brother back story was kind of lame.  This movie could have and should have been better.,1335830400,,308,4.865384615384615
4345244,5,B004EPZ03O,"The Film:

A perfect continuation of Henson's characters, and a sort-of spiritual-sequel to the original film and the classic TV-show, ""The Muppets"" follows Walter, a muppet born into a human family, who learns that an evil oil-tycoon plans on destroying the Muppet Studio.  He must re-unite Kermit, Gonzo, Miss Piggy and the other Muppets so they can put on one final show to raise the money and save their theater.  Filled with delightful inside-jokes, great meta-humor and a tone that is appropriate for all ages (I've known people aged 7 who enjoyed the film, and people in their 60's who have loved it as well), this is a perfect family movie.  A 5 out of 5 any day!

Three-Disc Blu-Ray Set:

Great picture and sound quality, and some nice special features, though this set doesn't feel as complete as I'd have thought.  I wish there could have been more for the features, especially given this is a 3-Disc Set.  In fact, most of the discs are devoted to the DVD and Digital Copies (and the soundtrack download), and not to bonus content.  It feels like a bit of a missed opprotunity.  (Especially given some of the features, like the fake trailers, are available online for free.)

That being said, the perfection of the film makes this a definite buy for fans of the series!",1335830400,,1281,4.674107142857143
4345245,4,B004EPZ03O,"Thirty years after ""The Muppet Show"" went off  the air, I wondered what a new Muppet movie would have to offer. Apparently, its creators were wondering the same thing, because ""The Muppets"" asks, literally, if the Muppets are still relevant in today's world. Walter (Peter Linz) is a Muppet who grew up with a human brother Gary (Jason Segel), and he is a huge fan of The Muppets well into adulthood. Gary plans an anniversary trip to Los Angeles with his girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams) and Walter. There they discover that the Muppets have disbanded, and Muppet Studios will fall into the hands of an oil baron (Chris Cooper) who wants to tear it down unless Kermit the Frog (Steve Whitmire) can buy the theater back for $10 million. They only way to do that is to host a Muppet Telethon with all the old gang.

Though ""The Muppet Show"" was intended to entertain children and adults alike, it always seemed like the words were intended for the adults and the actions were aimed at the children in the audience. ""The Muppets"", the movie, actually parodies children's programming at times. The self-consciously corny musical numbers are all parodies of something. There is some stinging humor and vicious mockery here, couched in smiling song and dance numbers. There are also the requisite comic interactions between the Muppet performers: Kermit, Miss Piggy (Eric Jacobson), Fozzie Bear (Eric Jacobson), Gonzo (David Goelz), and the rest. I have to admit it's nice to see the Muppets again, especially once the Telethon gets underway.

I was surprised by how reflexive ""The Muppets"" is, but the relevance or irrelevance of The Muppets is an obvious choice of theme, isn't it? If the filmmakers were wondering how much audience a Muppet movie could possibly have in 2011, why not make the movie about that very subject? It's more economical than searching for other inspiration. When Kermit wants to host a Muppet Telethon to raise money to save the studio, no network wants him. The motley crew of fuzzy puppets are assumed to no longer be relevant. Even Tex Richman, the oil baron, says so. Well, Kermit gets a break and a chance to find out if The Muppets can play to a modern audience. And the filmmakers found their answer in those box office receipts.",1335744000,,2254,4.804123711340206

4345384,5,B004EPZ03O,"I grew up with the Muppets, watched them on TV all the time when I was a kid, but definitely wouldn't say that I have some kind of soft spot in my heart for them.  I reluctantly watched this movie just because my wife insisted on it.  By the time it was over I was saying ""We are going to have to own this"".
The writers did an incredible job bringing the Muppets into this era.  If this had been a standard Muppet movie, with all of the Muppets being the main cast and centered around another ""Muppet Caper""  it would have been a straight to DVD release.  The writers were very smart to bring the Muppets back by making the story ABOUT bringing the Muppets back.  Another great aspect of this was the balance of nostalgia and new material.  I'd say, off the top of my head, that the music in the movie was split into thirds, one part classic Muppet songs, one part new material and one part popular songs of this era performed by the Muppets.  It was a perfect balance of ""Oh man, I haven't heard that song in decades"" (and then not being able to get it out of your head for days) and listening to new songs that give the movie a fresh feel.  It was heartwarming to see the Muppets ""get back together"" throughout the course of the story.

I will say that it was only my wife and I that watched this, no kids.  I believe she liked it because of the nostalgic aspects and I liked it just because it was damn good writing.  To be able to balance nostalgia, bring an otherwise outdated concept into a modern context and breath some new life into it with original material couldn't have been an easy feat, but these guys did it.  I can't comment on how kids would feel about this movie though.
The parallel story of the two humans in the story is pretty basic.  I would have loved to see more out of Amy Adams, I believe her to be a great actress, but it was a Muppet Movie so it's not like there was room for heavy emotional conflict.

The one thing about the movie that I didn't like was the main Villain.  I hate to say it, but part of me buys into the whole idea of the evil oil baron being written into the script as a stab at the political right.  I personally don't care, but it was a little out of place to think that an oil rig would have been built on half a block in Hollywood.  There would have been so many more plausible scenarios for that.  I don't believe that it was a conspiracy to brainwash our youth, as some apparently do, but I can't see it as anything other than a conscious political decision.

4345538,1,B004EPZ03O,"I was looking forward to the Muppets with much excitement, I was thinking how i used to like the older show from the 70s, and so was eager to watch this new movie with high hopes and big expectations.

However, the Muppets really let me down, I was very disappointed with this terrible terrible movie.

and where do i start to explain how bad this movie is, and what went wrong !!

 I guess everything about it was very badly done and poorly executed. there was clearly a lack of imagination and lack of Muppets magic !!

Now I know that this movie is a family one, and is mainly aimed at kids and the young ones, however, it doesn't even appeal to kids as well, in fact, my kids lost interest early on and after only a few minutes from starting the movie.

So the movie starts with an introduction to a muppet named Walter, who for some unexplained reason is living with  Humans and has a human as brother, Gary played by Jason Segel.

Walter is a big fan of the Muppets "" obviously !! "" and never misses a show during the 70s, soon the show stops and the Muppets are no more and are forgotten by the world, so years pass by and we are jumped to our current time, where Walter and Gary are all grown up and are ready to take a trip to Los Angeles to visit the Muppets studios and bring back the Muppets to life !!

Jason Segel was just not made for a role like this, he does not have the talent of a dancing and lively performer needed for such a role, and he looked uninterested as ever !! his acting looked so fake and unreal.

we are also introduced to Gary's love interest and girlfriend, Mary played by Amy Adams, and here the love story is devoid of any believable emotions and is as boring as ever. I think the character development was poorly done for these two main characters and so no real attachment from the viewers towards them.
And while Amy was slightly better than Segel here, she still looked uninterested and her character lacked the charm needed. probably not Amy's fault but rather to the lack of creativity in character development in the script.

speaking of characters, almost every Muppet is brought back here, which might be a bad thing, because so much characters were squeezed into the film not allowing enough time for viewers to connect to certain Muppet characters. It was clearly aimed at focusing on Kermit, but even him was rushed into the film quickly without explanation to where he was and why he is living the way he was all alone.

the plot was flat and silly, with a mixture of the Muppets reuniting and struggling to get back into show business and having to have to deal with an evil rich businessman who wants to take over the Muppet studios and turn it into some oil producing company or whatever. that villain role went to Chris Cooper, who also seemed out of place here and was one of the worst villains of all time in movie history, a Cliche of a villain with the obvious "" ill get you Muppets "" and "" I will destroy the Muppets "" lines !

It was clear that the people behind the movie were concentrating more on which celebrity to bring in as a Cameo rather than focusing on the plot. there were plenty of Cameo appearances including Selena Gomez and Zack Galifiankis which did not add anything special to the film.

the worst part of the film, is as i mentioned, the lack on imagination, magic and life in the movie. the dances and songs seemed lifeless and lacking the magic or spirit needed for such movies. it ended up dull and very very boring.

sorry to say this, but this gets a fat zero, avoid it !!

When they announced this movie was coming out I was all but screaming for joy. I saw it in the theater with my family and was taken back to my childhood, it having the same heart as all that has come before it. I would have seen it a second time in theaters if I had been given the chance. I pre-ordered the blu-ray/DVD/Digital Copy the moment I had the chance. I love rewatching it in my home, catching many of the things I didn't during my first viewing. The whole thing is charming and puts you in the good mood that you need after a bad day and a hopeful one for the next. The bonus features were also incredibly enjoyable, I particularly liked the bloopers and the behind the scenes.

4345540,5,B004EPZ03O,"The Muppets are part of US history as much as anything else that you hold true and dear to this mighty country. They are one thing that should make us proud as humans, a tradition that shall never die, a source of happiness that shall never end. Maybe for that reason several movies and TV shows about the Muppets have been done since the first film in 1979, which was released before season four of ""The Muppet Show."" This new 2011 version, simply called ""The Muppets,"" lives up to its expectations and carries the spirit of its predecessors. It is one truly fun and delightful film for all the family.

 ""The Muppet"" is described as a ""live-action musical feature film,"" which means that, in addition to the story, there are some musical elements to it. On this occasion, the story begins in a town simply referred to as SmallTown, USA. It is there that we find brothers Gary (Jason Segel) and Walter (the Muppet). We see them when they are small, and as they grow and mature. The problem is, Gary grows up, but Walter stays small. Despite their differences, they love each other and live a happy life. Both of them, too, enjoyed watching ""The Muppet Show"" on TV. But for Walter it was much more than a TV show -- it was a revelation. He indentified with the Muppets - he was one of them --, and Kermit the Frog became his hero.

One day, Gary tells Walter the he and Mary (Amy Adams), his girlfriend, were going to Hollywood and that he was invited to go with them. Walter was told that one of the stops while visiting town was the famous Muppets Studio. As you can imagine, Walter was very happy and couldn't wait to get there. Once they visit the studios, they become disillusioned because the place was almost in ruins and forgotten. Walter silently gets away from the studio tour, and sneaks inside one of the buildings. He hears voices and hides. One of the voices that hears is that of Tex Richman (Chris Cooper), a powerful businessman that wants to buy the studios, so that he can demolish them and pump the oil reserve that lies beneath. This, of course, upsets Walter, who notifies Gary and Mary about Richman's cruel intentions. The three of them go to Kermit's mansion, to convince him to try to stop Richman. Kermit is now retired from show business. However, Walter manages to convince him to get the gang together. Enter all of our friends - Fozzie Bear, Animal, Swedish Chef, Gonzo, Scooter, and, of course, Miss Piggy --, and, with the involuntary help of Veronica Martin (Rashida Jones), they will save the day.

I really enjoyed ""The Muppets,"" and, at this point, it seems that I don't get tired of them. Never mind that the film is loaded with guests, such as Jack Black, Whoopi Goldberg, Alan Arkin, Emily Blunt, James Carville, Neil Patrick Harris, Sarah Silverman, and more. The fantastic Wocka Wocka Value Pack includes the Blu-ray, DVD and Digital copy editions of the movie, as well as the soundtrack. The Blu-ray and DVD also feature making-of specials, deleted scenes, audio commentaries, blooper reels, and much more! Released March 20, 2012.  (USA, 2011, color, 103 min plus additional materials).

4345543,4,B004EPZ03O,"I was so disappointed with Disney's recent attempt to revive the Winnie the Pooh ""franchise"" that I had little faith they would do any better with the Muppets.

Was I wrong!  This is a sweet and hilarious film, perhaps the best Muppets effort ever.

Now for sure, the absence of Jim Henson and Frank Oz are felt here -- but so are the Muppets!  Wocka wocka!

Seriously, though, this movie will be welcome to all the fans of the Muppet TV series and movies, and serve as a superior introduction to a younger generation who may wonder just what magic muppetry can provide in the age of CGI.

The jokes here work -- even Fozzy's!  The songs are cute -- and they don't go on too long!  There are many cameos of celebrities both young and old!  (And I'm dating myself when I admit that I didn't have a clue who the young man portraying the human version of Walter the Muppet is -- I didn't recognize his face or his name.  Is this guy a pop star?  A reality TV person?  He looks too slight to be an athlete and too young to be a politician. Ah well...)

In addition, the muppetry has never been more seamless -- the Muppet performances and fluid direction combine to make you forget you're looking at marionettes from the git go.

Of the human performers on display here, the Muppets deploy a secret weapon -- Amy Adams.  She is simply sensational in her role as the hapless Gary the human's dear and long-suffering fiancee -- and she can also fix a car or an electrical system without breaking a nail!

I can't pay Ms. Adams a higher tribute than to say that she more than holds her own sharing a song with Miss Piggy.  Only the most charismatic and adept performers can accomplish that, given the porcine performer's prodigious scene-stealing prowess!

And like the very best family movies, this one will bring a tear (or two or three) to the eyes of generations who have grown up with these endearing felt creations.

I have deducted one star only because this DVD has only one bonus feature, a ""Blooper Reel"" that runs a scant ten minutes or so.

I'm sorry, but there is simply no excuse for the omission of the director's commentary and making-of featurette that appear in the Blu-Ray edition, and the Disney Company seems not to have paid any attention to the movie's essential message: that an attempt to try and do something worthwhile in the company of old and dear friends trumps any venal grab for money or power.

So forty lashes with a wet noodle for Disney execs -- and kudos and props and a hearty welcome back for the Frog, Pig, Bear, Daredevil, Drummer, Chickens, Chef, and all their colleagues and collaborators here.",1334620800,,2630,4.494736842105263

I loved the in-jokes, the songs, the dancing, the cameos made by today's celebrities, and even when they constantly broke the 4th wall I couldn't stop laughing!  The introduction of Walter was good and Jason Segle did an amazing job with this movie!

The Muppets are just truly special and while the last few movies may not have been the greatest whenever the Muppets come back to the big screen you better know I am gonna be there. `The Muppets' is a very different Muppet movie because it is really a tribute to them from the fans that missed them and just plain adore them. Jason Siegel wanted to bring them back for a whole new generation to enjoy and while the movie is great there is just a little something missing. Still, it's not that what is missing can be found because it is the voices of the characters, but unfortunately the original cast is just getting to that point where they can't work at it anymore. Still, it is a film that wants to preserve the magic that Jim Henson created over 50 years ago and as a movie on its own it is a great movie. The soundtrack is not the greatest, but the more you listen to it the more you learn to like it. I feel that this Muppet movie is going to start something big for the next few years more films and even a new TV show is in the works.

We just can't have a world without these great characters and this time around the movie itself shows us just how great The Muppets truly are. If you are a Muppets fan you are going to love all the classic stuff thrown into the new film as well as all the guest starts and blend a few new things into the mix you have yourself a true and fun Muppet movie.",1334275200,,1613,4.10126582278481
4345624,4,B004EPZ03O,"What I think we have to keep in mind with 'The Muppets' is looking at it in the context of its story.  This is the only Muppet movie I've seen that actually explicitly acknowledges 'The Muppet Show.'  To make this movie's story work in your mind, you have to imagine that the Disney-era Muppet films ('Muppet Treasure Island', 'Muppet Christmas Carol', etc.) don't exist.  The story is that, sometime after 'The Muppets Take Manhattan' (1984), the Muppets stopped.  So Walter, Gary, and Mary are trying to get the 'Muppet Show' era folks back together, as if they've been away for almost 30 years.  Hence why we don't see characters like Rizzo and more recent Muppet creations all that much (except in passing), and we really see characters we haven't seen in years!  Beauregard, Crazy Harry, Wayne and Wanda, Dr. Strangepork, the guy who hits the talking fuzzy head things with a mallet (name escapes me), etc.

It's also told from the point of view of the fans - something that has, again, not been featured in a lot of Muppet films.  Most of the films involve the Muppets dropped into a pre-existing story as characters (Kermit as a sea captain or Statler & Waldorf as the Marley Bros.).  This film talks about the Muppets as ""The Muppets"", like a band we all used to love that we'd love to see get back together.  If you walk into the movie with this in your mind, a lot of the comparisons folks have brought up won't bother you.

People have criticized the story as weak compared to the other films, but again, keep it in perspective.  'Treasure Island' and 'Christmas Carol' were classic stories in their own right with Muppets acting the roles.  The earliest Muppet movies had a magical cast of characters and storytellers (Jim Henson, Frank Oz, etc.) that you just can't replicate.  Don't get me wrong - the current crop of Muppeteers do a fantastic job, but if you're a diehard ""Henson-era Kermit"" kind of fan, it's illogical and unrealistic to think that things in this movie will be 100% the same as they were in the '70s.  And who says the Muppets always have to be really deep, thought provoking, or ironic?  Why can't they just be funny and goofy and make us laugh?

What the movie did for me was remind me of my childhood and watching the Muppets through my child's eye.  I loved them as a kid because they were cute and funny and cuddly.  I didn't realize until I was older just how clever and sly their humor was too.  This movie tries to do both things - hit the cleverness of the Muppets we appreciate as adults while reminding us why we fell in love with them in the first place as children.  From that perspective, this movie is a great delight for me.",1334275200,,2673,4.515592515592515

Still, this movie remains diverting entertainment, and the songs aren't bad at all, thanks to the talents of Flight Of The Conchords man Bret McKenzie.

I wasn't sure if the human and puppet (OK, muppet) interaction would look natural but credit to the writers, director, actors and muppets for making the blending of their two worlds seem believable. Success is when you start responding to them as living creatures. Typical muppet antics and humor dialogue for all age although a bit more for the older crowd as in the tele series.

4345699,3,B004EPZ03O,"If you were one of the unfortunate ones that saw The Muppets Wizard of Oz a few years ago, I don't think I need to explain why I went into this movie with very, very low expectations. Face it- the Muppets haven't done much since the early 90s, and to me, the last decent thing they had was The Muppet Christmas Carol. When I was younger, I'd always rent VHS tapes of The Muppet Show and Muppet Babies was one of the regular shows I'd watch on tv, but I can't say I was really a huge fan of them. All the bland movies over the last 10 years didn't help my stance on the matter. Sure, there were a couple of sketches and characters I liked a lot, but that was about it. When The Muppets hit theaters just a few months ago, there were seemingly no bad reviews- just tons of praise from viewers who had nothing but fond memories of the Muppets from their childhood. Honestly, it seemed like they made this movie seem better than it actually was, not letting go of the nostalgia. But I knew that this movie would be even slightly better than Muppets Wizard of Oz if only because of Jason Segel, someone who genuinely cares about puppetry.

The Muppets' plot is simple Muppet-ish stuff: Gary is a human and his brother, Walter, is a Muppet (don't ask). They're close, always do things together, and both of them are huge fans of The Muppet Show. When the two go with Gary's girlfriend, Mary, on a little vacation, they take a trip to the original Muppet Studios- a dream come true! But when they get there, everything is in shambles. Buildings are dusty and devoid of life, and it turns out that a rich Texan oil man, Tex Richman, has bought the land that the studio is on, and plans to destroy everything to make way for oil drilling. Unless ten million dollars is raised within a few days to negate the contract, the studio is toast. So Walter and Gary find Kermit and convince him to get the gang back together and put on a show to save everything. Fozzie, Gonzo, Rowlf, Piggy, the Electric Mayhem Band, even secondary Muppets like Crazy Harry, Lips and Lew Zealand join the gang once more for what could be their last hurrah. Unfortunately, Gary's so distracted by this Muppet business that he forgets all about spending time with Mary, despite being a full-grown adult, and seems more concerned with Walter fitting in with the Muppet gang than anything. How will the relationship go with their 10th anniversary coming up?

Yeah, it's nothing new, but it sure could've been worse (seriously, go watch The Muppets Wizard of Oz if you don't believe me). Something that worried me was that a lot of time would've been spent with Gary and Mary instead of the focus being on the Muppets, but that wasn't quite the case. Time is split between the two plots very well, with Kermit and the gang getting a good 75% of the screen time. The movie moves at a fast pace, and it was fun seeing them recruit everyone. Gonzo being a big time plumbing supply business man was nice, Fozie having a wanna-be group of Muppets to go on stage with was a good joke, and what happened to Animal is so good that I won't ruin the gag here. Really, there isn't any kind of big problem I have with the movie other than they played it too safe, and that jokes were a lot tamer than some of what was on The Muppet Show and a few of the better movies. There were a few times where I laughed a little bit, namely the Animal bit, what Rowlf was doing when they recruited him, a kidnapping bit that just plain looked funny in how a certain character moved, and a few minor sight gags. The Muppets is easily accessible to people of all ages. My daughter is 5 years old, and she LOVES this movie, already having the songs memorized, and cracks up during the 'Muppet Or A Man' bit.

Even though I say there's no big problem I have with the movie, it's still pretty plain. Walter is as generic as you can get, and his big talent that comes into play towards the end is so lame that I thought it was a joke, and that his real talent was going to be revealed after what he did. I also can't stand the new voice actor for Rowlf. Yes, I get that he was silent for so many years after Jim Henson's death out of respect, and I appreciate that, but this guy sounds nothing like Rowlf. He was better off staying silent in all honesty. Some of the Muppet movements are off too, and this isn't coming from some hardcore Muppet fanatic. Kermit's signature arm shaking isn't as crazy as it should be, and there were a lot of times where certain Muppets' mouth movements were off. These are just little nitpicks, and won't apply to most people, but it distracted me from enjoying the movie. Oh well, at least Uncle Deadly, one of my favorites, finally got some good screen time! And for those worried about the use of CG in the movie, don't worry- it's used sparingly, and was mostly used to eliminate wires/rods on the Muppets' arms, but is also used for a couple of scenes.

Something I never liked about the old Muppet movies was how dark and faded everything looked. It always put me down to see such a lively cast of characters like that. Well, that problem is long gone on the blu-ray. Colors pop out at you, are lush and will really make use of your tv. Leave it to Disney to make sure the picture quality is top notch on home releases. You can see every tiny detail on the Muppets if you look hard enough. The audio quality gets equally good treatment with a 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track. Yes, it's more than the movie needs, since there aren't giant robots flying around blowing things up, so what? It helps the musical numbers more than anything else.

As far as the special features go, this combo pack got a good amount of extras, though it's not as much as you might expect for the first major Muppet movie in years. First up is a commentary track with Jason Segel, executive producer/co-writer Nicholas Stoller, and director James Bobin. The guys give out tons of fun facts and information about how the film came to be, and it's always good to hear from Segel, who really knows his stuff when it comes to puppetry and the Muppets. He's been good on commentary tracks before, and he continues to be fun to listen to here. There's an 8 minute 'The Longest Blooper Reel Ever. At Least In Muppet History...We Think', and I'll just let the name of this feature speak for itself. It's amusing, but goes on longer than it should. Also on here are 13 minutes of deleted scenes and an alternate ending which is a little unsettling compared to what they went with for the final cut. Finally are a quick faux script reading, a short featurette about the making of the movie (way better than any 'making of' I've seen over the last couple of years), and some spoof trailers, which to me were the best thing on here. And it's worth noting that every time you pause the movie, you get one of many different intermission sequences with Statler and Waldorf, live action sequences or previews of other extras. It's quality over quantity here. And if you go with the 3 disc package, there's also a code to download the soundtrack, but you have to get it through the Disney Movie Rewards site, where you get to download a Zip file after entering the code. It's annoying, but hey, you still get the soundtrack for free.

I watched the movie just a few hours ago, and when it was over, I went on with the rest of my night, not thinking much about it. There wasn't a lasting impression that was left on me, but again, it's still a heck of a lot better than say...Muppets Wizard of Oz. To me, the movie could've been better if they ditched the Walter and Gary characters and made it be 100% about the Muppets. Amy Adams was more or less wasted, apart from showing off her singing talents a few times, and the slew of celebrity guests are mostly in blink-and-you-miss-them roles. Still, there are worse ways to spend an hour and a half of your time, and no matter what I say, hardcore Muppet fans will adore his no matter what. If you're a casual fan, it's worth a rental.",1333843200,3,8011,4.369550637156271

He did a loving and funny homage to the gang fronted by Kermit the Frog in his star vehicle&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forgetting-Sarah-Marshall-Unrated/dp/B001L2IFVM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forgetting Sarah Marshall (Unrated)</a>, so I had high hopes and a good feeling when I learned that he was writing this new incarnation for a new generation. Alas, the writing just may be this movies biggest flaw. It's packed with weak jokes, recycled from old muppet shows and films, a storyline that is blah, and new characters who are flat (even by muppet standards) and uninteresting.

Take the new muppet and central character of the film, I hesitate to call him a hero, his name is Walter and he is neither funny nor interesting. He seems like a reject muppet character who finally landed a role because he's friends with the director or the writer(!). Though Siegal himself fairs little better, with dumb jokes and a bland personality, poor Amy Adams, a great talent who looks confused much of the time, but still does her best to put her game face on and seems at home in her musical numbers. Chris Cooper, an Oscar winner is the one dimensional villain, with an unimaginative name, Tex Richman, he's also not funny, but he does keep a straight face while performing a misguided rap number. There are also a lot of pointless cameos, why James Carvell(?), I don't even think that most of them are meant to be funny.

There are charming moments, a lot of smiles, but few genuine laughs. Kermit and the gang are always welcome visitors for me, but it takes Kermie twenty minutes to even show up in this movie and Miss Piggy has more an extended guest appearance, she's also not voiced by her muppeteer maestro Frank Oz. The last act when they finally put a proper muppet show works best, it nearly made this movie worth it for me, but it was a long time coming and it still wasn't exactly perfect. I won't give up on the muppets and this is a clean family friendly movie, I hope they do better next time, while I didn't dislike the movie, I can't recommend it to anyone, even muppet die hards because it is just too uneven.",1333670400,5,2754,5.010917030567685

4345811,3,B004EPZ03O,"I grew up in Baltimore County. We watched Washington TV as well as Baltimore's, and the Muppets were a delight. Their five-minute nightly show, ""Sam and Friends"", mostly comprised the Muppets doing goofy or weird versions of popular songs. (For example, Kermit plays with an inchworm that turns out to be the tip of the tail of a huge monster that swallows him.) Jim Henson also produced brilliant Muppet-based commercials for local businesses. (You can see these on YouTube. They are startlingly violent and downright nasty, even by modern standards.)

As with Mickey Mouse cartoons, the Muppets were never intended as kiddie entertainment. But Americans -- whose ""taste"" in entertainment is virtually non-existent -- associate puppets and animated films with children. This, combined with the success of the Muppets as part of ""Sesame Street"", and their //failure// on SNL, cemented the view that the Muppets existed to provide cute, family-safe entertainment.

Since then, the Muppets have done nothing the least-bit subversive (other than Sam the Eagle, who is an obvious poke at conservatives). Worse, almost everything they do is in a shallow show-biz vein. ""The Muppets"" is a rehash of their first film, when they try to break into show business. Only /this/ version is suffused with a maudlin sentimentality that gets worse as it progresses.

Which isn't to say ""The Muppets"" doesn't have some very funny moments (I particularly liked the slap at Universal Orlando), but Brian Henson, et al, need to find a way to make the Muppets appealing to an intelligent adult audience. ""The Muppets Take South Park"", perhaps?

PS: Note that Walter's discovering his attraction to the Muppets can be interpreted as a metaphor for ""something else"".

PPS: Last night I saw a few minutes of Disney's ""The Country Bears"". Is it any surprise that both films share the same plot elements (""I'm not like the rest of my family"" + ""We've got to save the theater!"")?",1333411200,,1952,5.068535825545172

They added TOO many songs. Now, Man or Muppet and the song Kermit sings in his mansion were good along with the classic Rainbow Connection.

But the song at the very beginning, the Me Party song and the rest were a waste of minutes in the film. They could have used those minutes for more classic muppet humor.

The film would have been perfect if Disney didn't add too many songs like it was an animated disney movie classic.

Jim Henson always owned the muppets and he did best at them. It's a great movie, but those extra songs get boring and weren't needed in the film.",1333324800,,707,4.214814814814815

Was glad to see all my favorite characters.  Did we care of how Piggy looked in the film-not really.

My family and I watched them almost without fail in the 1970s and 80s.  What an entertaining and fun TV series.  My wife and I have seen many of the Muppet movies since then, our favorite being the Treasure Island Muppet movie.

But this latest movie flopped, and badly.  It wasn't funny, other than a few chuckles.  It lacked that offbeat wit emblematic of the Muppets of old.  Only the hobo scenes in the theater clicked.  The movie repeatedly pounded on the theme that the Muppets were washed up, faded, forgotten by Hollywood and their fans, etc. etc.  I'm sorry to say it, but with this kind of production these bleak comments will certainly come true.

I could live with the movie's ""be yourself, we're all one big family, we gotta make choices"" gooey stuff if it'd been offered up with even just a whiff, a wink of sly humor.  Disappointing.

4345972,5,B004EPZ03O,"Last year, three major films paid tribute to beloved genres, all largely delighting their proponents and enlisting new audiences as to why they were great in the first place. One is the Oscar-winning Best Picture, ""The Artist,"" capturing Hollywood's golden age with no cynicism or irony, as seen through the eyes of young French filmmakers discovering the joys of classic moviedom; another is ""Hugo,"" an impassioned gateway to a master of celluloid magic, this time drawing the uninitiated into not-to-be-forgotten wonders through his discovery by young people.

The third is ""The Muppets,"" the first Muppet project to fire on nearly every cylinder and recapturing the shameless lunacy of Jim Henson's iconic variety show-- once the most popular TV show in the world. Other attempts to bring back their spark have had their moments and should not be dismissed (believe it or not, one project that best captured it in recent years was ""Elmo's Christmas Countdown"" with Ben Stiller, which was as much in the spirit of ""The Muppet Show"" as ""Sesame Street."")

It took superfan Jason Segel's A-list clout to get the movie greenlit and Flight of the Conchords director James Bobin's encyclopediac passion for ""The Muppet Show"" to make it work. And in the tradition of the self-reflexive, we-know-we're-in-a-movie tradition of the Muppets, the plot is a surprisingly direct address at whether anybody still cares about Kermit, Miss Piggy and the gang.

Even Disney, who owns the franchise and released the movie, isn't spared if you know the history: the villain's claim that he owns the names of our friends and they have no rights to them anymore is reminiscent of the attitude attributed to a Disney regime of the past. (But of course, in the words of Basil Fawlty, ""We're all friends now!"")

Bobin was an inspired selection as director. Though ""Flight of the Conchords"" may not seem, at first, to be a cousin in comedy to The Muppet Show (and it's certainly not for children), but the wide-eyed naivete, the shameless absurdity and the earnestness of its main characters is very much in the same vein. ""Conchords"" star Bret McKenzie's Muppet songs are very much like sanitized versions of his comic tunes for the ""Conchords"" BBC Radio series and HBO TV show.

McKenzie's ""Man or Muppet"" has made history as the first Oscar winner for the Muppets. Not ""Rainbow Connection"" nor ""The First Time it Happens"" won their statuettes -- there hasn't even been a special Oscar for Jim Henson. The song is funny and memorable but I really like ""Life's a Happy Song"" and Amy Adams' ""Party of One.""

Speaking of the radiant Ms. Adams, she has little to do in the film (as is the tradition in Muppet productions, after all) but she makes every moment shine. I can't help draw a parallel, this time to another loving tribute film in which she starred -- ""Enchanted"" -- which has a lot of similarities in tone and sincerity to The Muppets.

The DVD/Blu-ray/movie & music download package, aka the ""Wocka Wocka"" edition, certainly offers a lot for the money. Once again, DVD owners will not get every feature as Blu-ray owners, which still seems not nice.

One thing DVD owners do not get, besides a nicer-looking picture,is the entertaining audio commentary (thank you!) with Segel, Bobin and co-writer Nick Stoller. Segel constantly ribs the Disney folks in the studio with them by relentlessly cross-promoting in classic Disney synergy fashion, as well as remind us of almost every film in Adams' resume.

One interesting Blu-ray feature is also quite curious: whenever the disc is paused, an ""intermission"" sequence pops on. Each time, it rests on a different point in a series of connecting gags. It's a nice idea-- but it also prevents the viewer from freezing a frame to catch a quick Muppety gag in the background (a funny sign, inside joke, etc.) So ironically, the DVD owner can freeze frames while the Blu-ray watcher cannot.

Wocka wocka, indeed!",1333152000,3,3938,4.935045317220544
4345973,1,B004EPZ03O,"I grew up with the Muppets, and I loved this movie in the theaters.

The one star is for the fact that the digital copy is useless.  I know that movie studios are trying to crack down on piracy, so the digital copy here isn't a huge file that you download and can just give someone else for free.  Older Blu Ray discs like _Kick Ass_ and _The Town_ offered digital copies like this.

Instead, what you get is the right to stream the movie from Disney's website.  To me, this is absolutely useless because I want a digital copy so I can watch the movie on a device without anything else necessary.  No disc, no Internet connection, nothing.  Isn't that what it's supposed to mean?  I use digital copies to watch the movie on my iPad2, for example, when I'm on an airplane flight.  That's sort of the point of a portable, digital copy.

Now, you *have* to have an Internet connection, which means that 1) you could be already near a device with a disc reader, 2) Disney's website could control the transmission bitrate and thus the movie's video quality, 3) you might have to eat into your device's data usage plan (and movies aren't exactly conservative on bandwidth usage), or 4) you might have to PAY MONEY on a plane for Wi-Fi to watch a digital copy that you supposedly paid for already.

So my suggestion is that you buy the Blu Ray/DVD combo, unless you want the soundtrack for the price difference.  At least I got the soundtrack.  The movie industry needs to deal with piracy in another way, IMHO.

4345974,5,B004EPZ03O,"Okay, so my older son is a die-hard Muppet fanatic and he always has been. Needless to say, he was ecstatic the first night the movie came out in theaters, and just as much so when it came out on DVD. Me and my husband grew up on the Muppets as well, so we were excited for the grand revival of this great franchise.

This movie is amazing. It's funny, it's heart-warming, and it reminds us all why the Muppets were the international superstars they were, and are becoming again. My word, Jason Segel did an amazing job. There are no faults whatsoever in this movie. My son, now 16, bought the movie and watched it as soon as he got home from the store in our family room.

I have two little ones as well, one 7 and one 5. Both have pretty severe special needs which cause them to be unable to sit through a full-length movie without losing control. They grew up without the Muppets, and it was amazing to see what happened when they walked into the family room and sat down on the couch in front of the television.

They were entranced. They sat through the entire film, then asked to watch it again once it was done. I figured, hey it was awesome to find something to keep them entertained for a bit while I could get some housework done. Little did I know how big of an impact the movie would make on my kids.

I was in the kitchen one day and I overhear in the family room my little 5-year-old's voice: ""It's time to play the music, it's time to light the lights..."" She was singing the Muppet Show theme song, which was re-created for this movie. She wasn't watching the movie at the time, but while she was playing with dolls she was singing the unmistakable tune. It hit me how big of an impact they were making on my kids, just as much as they had made for me. I used to sing that song while I was playing, back when the Muppet Show was a huge weekly phenomenon.

We were watching the movie the next night, and I asked my 7-year-old son, ""What's your favorite character?"" Up until the movie came out, if a child was interested in the Muppets at all, they would probbly answer with the basics (Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie...). However, my son answered ""Deadly."" Deadly is the gloomin evil assistant to the villain in the film, who eventually turns to the good side at the end of the film (sorry for the spoilers). Deadly was first introduced as a supporting player in The Muppet Show and wasn't seen since then up until this movie. The fact that my son chose him (His reason: ""He turned bad to good."") is an amazing thing o view, seeing as I grew up with characters like Deadly. They were all back, looking great, with new voices (from past puppeteers who have retired or passed on...) and thriving as ever. It was a beautiful thing to hear.

So, in conclusion, this movie is great. If you have little kids who have not grown up with the Muppets, get this movie. The Muppets area timeless group of entertainers who can keep an adult just as well as a kid entertained and satisfied as the credits roll.

Get the movie. You will be glad you did.",1333065600,4,3049,4.292173913043478

My dream for the Muppets would be for Disney to get some really great writers like John Lasseter & Andrew Stanton, the guys who did Toy Story and Finding Nemo, to do the Muppets next movie.

4346048,1,B004EPZ03O,"I was a fan of the original Muppet Show. My brother and I watched it every week. Oh, there were some skits that weren't all that funny, but for the most part it was pretty amusing. When The Muppet Movie came out, our parents took us to see it and we enjoyed it quite a bit, what with memorable songs like ""Rainbow Connection"" and ""Movin' Right Along"" to help move what was a fairly basic plot along. I don't remember much of ""Muppets Take Manhattan"" and I'm pretty sure I've never seen any of the other ""classic"" Muppet movies. Now that I have children of my own, I decided to take a chance on this new Muppets movie to help introduce my boys to characters I enjoyed when I was their age. MISTAKE.

The only smart thing I did was NOT purchase this film. Oh, I had seen plenty of previews to know this one was going to be ""iffy"" at best, but I had little to no idea just how bad this Muppet Mess was going to be. Starting out, we have a human and an obvious Muppet that are supposedly brothers ... and I actually didn't really have a problem with that. Hey, it's The Muppets. You have to suspend a little disbelief, correct? Except, why does no one even begin to question how a freakin' MUPPET was birthed from a HUMAN? Ok, ok ... suspended disbelief. Suspending disbelief, however, does not cover why everything else in this film is so freakin' awful. The songs are awful, and instantly forgettable. The ""dance"" numbers accompanying the songs? Bad. While it's true that I haven't seen a ton of movies with Jason Siegel in them, he has never impressed me with any kind of singing or acting talent. Granted, he has very little to work with here, but at the least I figured that Amy Adams; cute, adorable, Amy Adams could rise above it. Nope. She is just as bad. I mean, they even managed to make her look, shall I say, less than attractive in this film. Amy Adams! Incredible. Muppets, Humans, whatever, NONE of them could save the music in this flick (ARGH, don't get me started on ""We Built This City""). I cringed, seriously cringed, every time a musical number came up.

I'll briefly touch on the supposed ""villain"", the unsuprisingly stereotypical Evil Oilman/Businessman, Tex Richman. Tex Richman? Seriously? THAT is the most original name you could come up with? Here, kids, let me hit you over the head with a baseball bat full of subtlety. I was almost embarrassed for Chris Cooper in this role. Almost. After all, he agreed to do it, so my sympathy only goes so far. His evil scheme was an oil field in the middle of downtown Los Angeles. Totally believable, of course, because that's what evil businessmen do. They build oil fields in the middle of a city. Oil fields that are, at the most, the size of a mid-sized theater. Great plan. How did this bozo ever get his wealth? Speaking of wealth ...

... One of the beloved Muppet characters, the Great Gonzo, is shown as a quite successful businessman himself, and he has amassed what appears to be a small fortune building up a huge plumbing company. Kermit, Pseudo-human Walter, Jason and Amy come to Gonzo and tell him they need to raise a huge amount of money in a very short time, to save their old Muppet Theater. It's assumed that Gonzo has a bit of wealth himself at this point so he just gives them a loan, right? Outright gives them a huge wad of cash, no strings attached? Nah, he blows up his entire company (and fortune ... endangering dozens of employees at least) and hops in the car with them. Of course. Miss Piggy is also shown to be very successful but, you guessed it, the question of her loaning or giving any money for the cause doesn't come up either. No, that would be too convenient. Terrible.

The cameos in this film? Forced. Forgettable. Almost forgettable, that is. James Carville? REALLY?!? Sarah Silverman? Yep, she's a great, wholesome comic for a Disney audience. There was a decent chuckle when even Kermit didn't know the name of one of the Disney kid actors that showed up near the end. Of course, it was pretty much just a ""hey, look, we can laugh at ourselves"" moment, but at least it was SOMEthing semi-amusing. Outside of that chuckle, I laughed exactly twice during the rest of the movie, once involving the Swedish Chef and once at Jim Parson's cameo ... and that was it. I tried my best to get over the fact that these Muppets don't even sound like ""My"" Muppets (for obvious reasons), but it's difficult knowing that I can do a better ""Kermit the Frog"" than the guy who actually performs him now. Not braggin', that's a fact, and I'm not alone. I've heard others that were better, also. Well, whatever. In such an awful incarnation of the Muppets, their voices were, in the end, the least I had a problem with. Save your money. Save your memories. Go buy the Muppet Show DVDs instead, or the original Muppet Movie. Introduce your kids to the Muppets that way. When they grow up, they'll thank you for it.",1332892800,15,4904,4.4759776536312845

4346050,5,B004EPZ03O,"There are two reasons why I love this product. First, because of the content itself, and second the amazing job they did in this Blu-Ray release.

The Muppet movie is surprisingly (and consistently throughout) hilarious. Just like the old Muppets, it is full of subtle, unhighlighted in-jokes, references, and celebrity cameos. In fact, I am not sure what percentage of people who saw the movie understood all the references. I'm sure although I caught a bunch I didn't catch them all. All the jokes are funny for all ages, and had me thinking of silly moments and chuckling for weeks after (Such as ""Why does everybody forget about Hobo Joe!?"")

From a moral message standpoint, the Muppets shines out like many good Disney movies with a story about following your dreams, growing up, and never giving up. I don't have kids yet, but years from now I can't wait to sit with them and watch The Muppets together.

This is also one of the best formatted Blu-Rays I've ever watched, and I really appreciate the extra work they put into it.

From the start, there is a message saying which button to press to skip the ads. It's a little touch that makes me not mind the fact there are a bunch of trailers that auto play. Although, some of the trails were pretty nice, I do like being able to watch the new Brave trailer in high definition. the extra features are totally worth watching as well. Such as the mini-documentary (edited in such a way to reference the original Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy British miniseries) that is full of behind the scene footage featuring the ""off-screen Muppets"" that supposedly helped film the movie.

There a tons of little secrets and quirks as well. I recommend at some point during the movie when you feel like taking a break to pause the movie for a while, and enjoy the ""Intermission"" show that comes on. I mean, on what other Blu-Ray can you say that you can sit down and watch the pause screen for 10+ minutes?

On top of all that, for one price you get the Blu-Ray, DVD and Digital versions of the movie, in addition to the full Soundtrack. That's a pretty good value, I specifically really enjoy getting the Soundtrack for free as the music in the movie is so good/funny I was planning on purchasing it anyway.

I highly recommend all Blu-Ray owners, or potential future Blu-Ray owners buy this three disc combo pack.",1332892800,8,2361,4.607142857142857
4346051,4,B004EPZ03O,"I loved 'The Muppets 2011'....a fun, happy, total feel good movie for all ages in my opinion.  We need more fun and happy in our lives, especially in today's world....fantastic.",1332806400,6,177,4.9
4346052,5,B004EPZ03O,"I can remember as a kid watching THE MUPPET SHOW with my family, and we all liked it for various reasons, but no matter the age difference, we all laughed and loved the creations of the dear departed Jim Henson and Frank Oz. During the late 70's and into the early 80's, The Muppets were heavily ingrained in pop culture, with the show and with the feature films THE MUPPET MOVIE, THE GREAT MUPPET CAPER and THE MUPPETS TAKE MANHATTAN, where Oz made his directing debut. But in the years following, something happened. The further away from the lovable characters we were, the less we thought of them. After a few attempts to bring the Muppets to the big screen again after the passing of Jim Henson, with films like A MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL and MUPPET TREASURE ISLAND, nothing really became of them. The Muppets went from being universally beloved to ""Out of sight; out of mind"" in just one generation.

But leave it to the creative minds of co-writer/co-star Jason Segel, and THE FLIGHT OF THE CONCHORDS Bret McKenzie and director James Bobit to not only reintroduce The Muppets to a whole new generation, but to also remind those of us who had forgotten the great wonder and joy that we experienced watching The Muppets. Like some of the greatest of the Disney/Pixar films, they transplant the ideology of that company which is to always aim for the smartest person in the audience and allow the rest to be taken in by the joy of the spectacle.

But in their genius, Bobit, Segel and McKenzie actually engage us with these characters again, but not with a reboot or a reimagining or a sequel. They actually recognize, as does the film itself, that The Muppets haven't been a thing for quite some time, and their efforts to save their studio from demolishing by the diabolical villain of the piece, oil baron Tex Richman (played with tongue firmly planted in cheek by Chris Cooper) are shot down at nearly every turn by television executives who find they can get more mileage out of lowest-denomiator abusive reality TV than a program that is intelligent and charming (the film works on several levels; one of them being biting satire). As a writer, Segel sells his humor well, as well as the director Bobit, who directs the film with great verve and smarts. The songs by McKenzie are outrageous (the Oscar-Winning ""Man or Muppet""), infectious (""Life's a Happy Song""), and surprisingly poignant (""Pictures in My Head""). Also working her many charms here is Amy Adams, the perfect girl-next-door schoolteacher who can also fix a V-12 engine and is Segel's character's girlfriend of 10 years.

Also along side the many fuzzy characters (obvious returns by Kermit, Fozzie, Gonzo, Rolf, Animal, Beaker, and the indomitable Miss Piggy among many many others) is the new character of Walter, Segel's younger brother, who, along with Segel, finds his destiny with the help of The Muppets.

What could literally be the most telling moment of the whole film is as members of the Muppet cast sing an abridged and incredibly amusing version of Nirvana's eponymous classic, ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" in the presence of an angry Jack Black, calling them out as ruining one of the greatest songs of all time. This would probably be lost on most audience members the first time around, but when I rewatched it again just a few days ago, I saw there was something more going on. The song itself is considered the ultimate song of teen angst and volatile cynicism, but the way that the song is performed is outrageous, filled with lively humor and vacant of the vitriol of the original song. This is essentially the message of the film, and I'm paraphrasing Joss Whedon here: ""The ultimate expression of defiance is joy."" The film basically tells us all to deny what the societal norms are of cynicism, derision and snark and embrace the things that give us the greatest happiness; the things that are free of all of what our culture has become. For this reason above all, THE MUPPETS is a film for the ages, young and old.",1332806400,6,4009,4.7310443490701

I'm glad I grew up when you could enjoy Saturday programing like a kid should, relatively devoid of educational value.  If Laugh Olympics had a polictical point of view it was lost on me.  Or Pinelope Pit Stop had a feminist agenda (it might have, I was just a kid) I didn't know it.

Of course the fact I don't enjoy musicals like I did when I was a kid could be another of the reasons I didn't get past the first 23 minutes. The lyrics and choreography where terrible.

Not only did they capture the humor and charm that made the Muppets so special, Segal and crew gave the Muppets staying power in the the 21st century.

Many Muppet die hards, including performer Frank Oz, were not particularly happy with the script because they thought some of the jokes were too low brow for the Muppets. Unfortunately the great Frank Oz may have succumb to traditionalism and could not see the jokes that were inside the jokes. For some, the glory days will always be yesterday no matter what.

I watched the Muppets growing up, but was never a diehard fan, and my kids have never seen anything with them, so I wasn't sure we would enjoy this. But it's very warm-hearted, with lots of fun musical numbers that kept my kids engaged, while there were also enough 'inside' jokes to keep my husband and I amused. The story centers around two small town brothers - one man (played by Jason Segal) and one muppet named Walter. Segal's character has dated Amy Adam's character for 10 years, and they are off to Los Angeles for an anniversary trip. They bring Walter along to visit the Muppet Studio, only to discover it is about to be destroyed by a greedy oil baron unless the Muppets reunite for a telethon to raise $10 million.

So essentially you get The Muppet Show on the big screen with Statler and Waldorf their usual self.

All the Muppets you know and love are here - I enjoyed 80s Robot more than I should admit.

The story hits every required recycled plot point  - you can see it all coming a mile off and yet, this only makes the movie better. ""The Muppets"" breaks the fourth wall a few times, but doesn't abuse it and the wink to the audience works well.

The music is fun, although how ""Man or Muppet"" won an Oscar is beyond me...it's not even the best song in the movie.

BD disc, DVD for the car or other room, digital copy AND soundtrack, available as a download code in MP3 format (no actual soundtrack CD is included)

The story of the movie is simple, and as I'm sure others have noted, mirrors today in a World where the Muppets, are old hat, forgotten, and no longer recognized.
The story of getting back together for one ""big"" show, to raise money for the side plot, is curiously topical, as this movie in itself has launched the Muppets back from their relative obscurity.
I loved the simple story, and I remember enjoying the Muppets from their beginnings, in what really is a long time ago.
Over the years they morphed into Elmo, Fraggle Rock and innumerable Jim Henson exploits to keep up with the times, but Kermit and the gang were always at the heart, the original, still the best.
The fairly thin plot deals with Kermit and new friends tracking down the old gang, and trying to get the show on, to stop evil oil baron Chris Cooper (who is enjoying chewing scenery every second he's on screen) from tearing down their theater and studio.
A whole host of well known actors pop up in funny cameos to pad out the story, and Jack Black as the kidnapped celebrity host is a blast!
It's plain fun, good songs, dance routines and sillyness, and I loved it!
I suspect this movie will probably appeal more to older parents, and original fans, who will enjoy taking a whole new generation through the magical ride of the Muppets.

4346207,5,B004EPZ03O,"When the new film ""The Muppets"" (not to be confused with the earlier film, ""The Muppet Movie"") was released to theaters last year I reviewed the soundtrack CD here on Amazon. I downgraded my review because some of songs didn't ""work"" aurally and I was taken to task by a few folks because, at the time of my review, I had not seen the film. I was told that if I saw the film the songs would make sense. Well, I missed it in the theater but, based on the new Bluray DVD""Wocka-Wacka Pack"", I now understand the comments. And fully agree that the CD does work - if you've seen the film.

But we are discussing the DVD here so I'll get to that. As of today there are over 80 reviews posted on Amazon. But Amazon has a policy of combining ALL reviews of a film, whether in theaters or on DVD. And with DVD all reviews are combined whether the single DVD or BD or special editions. I'm commenting here on the 3-Sisc Combo Pack which includes the DVD version with ONE bonus feature - The Blooper reel"", disc with a digital copy of the film and the BD with about 35 minutes of featurettes plus the Director's Commentary. The longest feature is the 15 minute ""Making of"" the film, there are nine deleted scenes totaling 10 minutes, The blooper reel runs eight minutes and the very funny ""trailer spoofs"" fill another nine minutes.

The film is great and is perfect for ALL AGES. I certainly don't have to explain the Muppets to anyone. They are icons. The new songs this time are by Bret McKenzie (half of the ""Flight of the Conchords"" duo) and are really tuneful. (One of the featurettes has him discussing the styles he was trying to use). The plot goes back to the old Mickey (Rooney, not Mouse) and Judy (Garland) film musicals with the theme ""Let's put on a show and save the (insert cause here)!""

I found the menu prompts a bit difficult to use and never was able to get the new ""Disney Intermission"" feature (where the Muppets take over the screen if you pause the film) but I'm not a technophile either. The Muppet ""Screen Tests"" were another fun feature.

So it's now a few days since I watched the film and I'm still humming the tunes. (Oh yes, if you don't have the soundtrack CD you get a digital copy of the soundtrack with the ""Wocka-Wocka"" version.

Kermit and Miss Piggy rule! (And Jason Segal, Amy Adams and Chris Cooper - the non-Muppets (I won't say ""human actors"") - are not bad either.

4346208,2,B004EPZ03O,"The Muppets were beloved because everyone liked to see bits about their favorite characters - be at interaction between the Swedish chefs, Fonzie's bad jokes or the play between Kermit and Miss Piggy.  This new Muppets movie ditches most of that for new characters, a few humans and a Muppet that was raised as a human (a manly muppet?).  The Muppet theater is in danger and of course this man muppet newcomer is the only one who can save it, by bringing the crew back together again.  A few musical numbers and some shallow political digs, and the movie is basically over, with a slap dash ending to put the beast to rest.

Through the years the muppets all have carved lives out for themselves, more or less, and even the successful Miss Piggy tosses it all away for a chance to save the little muppet theater.  A grand notion of course, but not a realistic one (but then again, when is this supposed to be realistic?).  The first musical number is charming and quaint with some cute sight gags but it is the only one... the rest are unbearably cheesy and predictable.  And that's probably the best word for the movie right there, predictable.  It feels false, fabricated and made simply to play on nostalgic emotions.  Everything is seen through rose colored glasses and when they finally get their chance to make themselves ""relevant"" once again (after Kermit continually points out how washed up and forgotten they are), their grand return pretty much fizzles.  Jack Black as the captive host for their Muppet telathon, could have been a savior, but he's left as a set piece that is more window dressing and presence than anything else.

Will you like it?  If you enjoyed The Muppets in the past, you might find this sappy, slapped together movie a half-hearted romp through days gone by.  The movie is completely superficial and yanks on heart strings for emotional effect.  Children will likely be bored to tears.  Neither of mine (ages 5 and 7, both who have seen other Muppet movies and Sesame Street) liked the movie, although they did sit through it.  My seven year old, when asked by someone they knew if they had liked The Muppets, she shouted ""No, it was boring!"" and that pretty much sums it up as well...

4346212,5,B004EPZ03O,"I expected to like THE MUPPETS.  I did not expect to love it.  And yet, I do.  Family films are a hard sell for me, I'll admit this right off the bat.  The laughs usually come at the expense of intelligence, and the heartwarming ending is usually tacked on.  I prefer my movies gritty and bitter, and decidedly non-child-friendly.

Leave it to the Muppets to break the rules and create a family film that is actually good.  It's a simple story rooted in the idol worship many of us feel towards our felt friends: young man Walter is a huge fan of the Muppets; in them, he sees everything he is meant to be.  But when Walter discovers that the Muppets are has-beens, and that an oil tycoon wants to tear it down to drill for oil (""There's oil under this theater; I can smell it, and more importantly, the geological survey says there definitely is""), he and his older brother Gary set out, along with Gary's reluctant fiancee, to reunite the Muppets and raise ten million dollars.  ....And cue the Muppet shenanigans!

This is Jason Segal's love letter to his childhood.  His pure, unadulterated joy helps propel the film; matching him step-for-step is Amy Adams, who's done this sort of thing before.  Chris Cooper makes a delightful villain (and seeing the studious actor break into a rap song is just...well, it's just awesome), and the slew of celebrity cameos helps keep things interesting.  The real stars here, of course, are the Muppets themselves, and it's nice to see them in fine theatrical form, parodying their former fame while recapturing it perfectly via sight-gags, intricate and hilarious song numbers (""Man or Muppet"" won a Best Song Oscar for a reason), and heaping helpings of nostalgia.

Make no mistake though: for the young'uns, there's quite a bit of conventional humor; and for those of you who are older and maybe unfamiliar with the Muppets (you heathens), there are quite a few more adult-oriented jokes: meta-humor, quick gags, parodies of other films, an all-chicken rendition of Cee-Lo Green's ""F*** You"" (in a kids movie! Genius!).  The end result is a film that actually manages to equal more than the sum of its parts: it's a truly great family film, one that can be enjoyed by everyone from tots, to teens, to adults, to puppets.  Cue up THE MUPPETS, sit back, and prepare to spend the next hour and a half laughing your socks off.  And if you start to feel something warm growing around your heart?  Don't panic.

4346213,5,B004EPZ03O,"Of many wonderful childhood memories, I have to say that watching The Muppet Show with my parents and sisters ranks in the top five. After watching this film with my seven-year-old daughter, I got teary-eyed that she loved the same things I loved at her age--Miss Piggy's karate chops, Kermit's sweet earnestness, Fozzie's goofy jokes, Gonzo's strange chicken obsession--and that despite Jim Henson's passing, another generation of kids gets to enjoy his timeless creations.  I also got teary-eyed in the theater because I forgot HOW MUCH I loved these characters, and how much I'd missed them. It's so refreshing to see that, despite all the technology we surround ourselves with, especially our kids, some funny-looking little felt creatures can inspire our imagination and make us laugh.

4346334,5,B004EPZ03O,"After what seemed like a lifetime without anything up to their usual standards coming from the Muppets (even their attempt at a Muppet Wizard of Oz film was somehow botched), a very serious fan approached Disney Studios with a desire to make a movie that would restore the fantastic, felt funnymen to their former glory. That man was actor Jason Segel (""Forgetting Sarah Marshall""), and that film would come to be known as ""The Muppets"".

The plot initially sounded like a bad idea. The Muppets have to reunite to put on a show in order to save the Muppet Studios from a greedy oil tycoon who wants to tear it down for drilling. Seemed like something we'd seen a hundred times before, even in ""It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie"", let alone the Blues Brothers"". But, hey, that's sort of the joke. Even the oil tycoon here is played as a complete parody of the greedy businessman villain role, and in this film, it all works! The plot, of course, is meant to harken back to those old Mickey Rooney/Judy Garland ""let's put on a show"" classics, Mickey even doing one of the many brief celebrity cameos in the film. It's all very nostalgic and charming, which is a big part of what this film means to be and achieves wonderfully. This movie is about the Muppets, and putting on a show is what they do best. It's also a very smart film about reclaiming something you've lost while still staying true to yourself and what you love. It's about not giving up, but trying your best and facing the outcome either way. And, to be totally blunt, it's about how The Muppets lost their fame and how they try to gain it back. And, in a way, the film makes its own true story.

To get into detail here, Walter is a puppet born into a human family (no, we don't see how). His human brother Gary (Jason Segel) is also his best friend. Growing up, Walter was clearly a bit different, and this was a struggle for him until he discovered the original Muppet Show. Walter and Gary became big fans, but especially Walter. Kermit was his hero. After we see this bit of Gary and Walter history, we come to present day, in which Walter and Gary are adults, and Gary is planning to propose to his girlfriend, Mary (the beautiful and adorable Amy Adams), on an anniversary trip they are taking to Los Angeles. Mary is a bit disappointed that Walter is coming along, though she doesn't let it show. But, Gary has promised to take Walter to tour the Muppet Studios, and so they all plan to have a great time together. Once there however, they discover the Muppet Studios is a wreck, and the tour is a dud. Walter sneaks away from the group and into Kermit's old office though, and there he overhears a business deal selling the Muppet Studios to greedy oil tycoon Tex Richman (Chris Cooper). He then hears Richman brag to his lackeys that, rather than make a museum out of the place, he really intends to tear it down and drill for oil! A traumatized Walter returns to Gary and Mary with the news, and the three friends seek out Kermit the Frog to save the Muppet Studios from destruction. Unfortunately, Kermit has lost touch with the other Muppets, and so begins a quest to gather them up and put on a telethon (if they can get a celebrity host) to save the Studios and the very Muppet name!

The whole film is hilarious and heartwarming, with scenes that will bring tears to nostalgic eyes and even newcomers. This truly is an ""old school"" Muppet film (complete with a recreation of the Muppet Show opening and very true to the show yet very modern sketches), and it is successful on all fronts. The cast is perfect, the cameos and return of classic Muppets are delightful, and don't get me started on the songs. They were done by none other than ""Flight of the Conchords"" genius Bret McKenzie, and if you're a fan of that show, you'll be able to tell (if you're not familiar, trust me, it's a good thing, a very good thing). One of them even took home the Oscar for Best Song, and deservedly so. ""Man or Muppet"" is simply brilliant, as are the visuals that go with it. It's probably everyone's favorite scene in this film full of great moment after great moment, and tons of wonderful music.

Now, I'm not saying the film is flawless. It is brilliant, wonderful, a joyous and touching experience, but here is a little list of the only things I could possibly nitpick about off the top of my head. First, the old complaint about the Muppets' new voices still rings true. Kermit sounds better than he has in a while, though I've also gotten more used to him, but now we have to deal with the loss of Frank Oz, who just turned into a tremendous jerk at some point (if what I hear is true) and had to be replaced. Now, we have a Miss Piggy that sounds more manly than ever and a Fozzie who only sometimes sounds like Fozzie. It's tough, but you'll deal with it. This movie is too good not to. Second issue, there is one song in this film the villain performs. It's a rap, and it's not really a necessary song, and it could be funnier. Still, it's okay. The problem? On the Blu-Ray's deleted scenes, we can see the full scene/song rather than the edited version that is in the final film, and ya know what, it is so much better and it actually gives the song purpose. It tells us why he really hates the Muppets, explains his ""maniacal laugh"" joke (he actually doesn't know how to laugh, which has to do with why he hates the Muppets but isn't the whole story), and it has funnier lyrics than we get in the shorter version. So, yeah, cutting that song short was a mistake. Thirdly, where was Robin? Or Bean Bunny? And not a single line for Rizzo? Robin is too important to have zero lines, and Rizzo by now is too. I realize they had a lot of Muppets to try and stick in here, and there was a desire to give screen time to those that haven't had any for a while, and that is much appreciated, but I wish Rizzo had at least one joke, much like the one given to Pepe. That was perfect handling of Pepe, whom I enjoy but has gotten way too much spotlight in past several years. Rizzo perhaps was becoming too important too, but he deserved at least a joke. As for Robin and Bean, Robin is classic, and Bean I just don't want to see totally disappear. He takes me back to Jim's last years with us. And finally, the complaint so popular with internet reviewers, the ending of the film resolves a few loose ends rather quickly and in a way that, some might say, cheapens the overall message. I can see how they kinda had to do it that way. I mean, it didn't have to be such a contrived, quicky-quick way of going about it, but they certainly couldn't leave things the way the were. Maybe if the Muppet name hadn't been part of the contract, but that's how it is and, again, it's not something I can't live with. And, those are really the only things I can nit-pick about this still completely fantastic film. But, the real question now is, what will they do for the next big Muppet film? They're already planning it, Segel's co-writer from this one, Nicholas Stoller, is back on board to write and James Bobin, director of this film, will return to direct as well, but no Jason Segel. I've heard entirely that he was the heart and soul of this project and it's truth to the classic Muppets, so here's hoping Stoller and Bobin had a healthy hand in that as well, in reality. I'm really wondering what sort of plot they'll have though. This time it's going to have to be a lot more original, probably.

Now, about the ""Wocka Wocka Value Pack"" Blu-Ray, DVD, Digital Copy, and Soundtrack release. First, I'll say that I would have been quite satisfied with just the Blu-Ray and DVD. I don't even need the DVD, but I think it's nice to have in the more basic format if I wanna take it to watch at someone else's house or something. A lot of people don't have Blu-Ray players even today. I couldn't care less about digital copies. I don't have anything to play them on and wouldn't want to watch a movie on a tiny screen anyway. As for the soundtrack (which is also only a digital version), I already bought it on CD. BUT, with the online coupon from DisneyMovieRewards, the price made it cheaper than buying the non-Wocka Wocka version, so that's cool. Anyway, naturally, great, anamorphic picture, great sound, and the extras here are brilliant (incidentally, I found at least one Easter Egg). The ""Making Of"" documentary is done in a clever, British educational film style. Very funny, and as with all the bonus features, the Muppet performers stay in character. Even in the blooper reel, which is also fantastically entertaining. There are plenty of deleted scenes too, full of cut cameos. As I mentioned before, we get the great, full length Tex Richman song as a bonus feature as well. There's also a great screen test that doubles as a comedic short film about screen tests, all those great Muppet movie trailer parodies (save for that most recent ""Hunger Games"" one to promote this Blu-Ray), and certainly the most significant bonus feature, the audio commentary with writer and star Segel, co-writer Stroller, and director James Bobin. The audio commentary is one of those really fun commentaries, even if the Muppets don't take part (a Muppet commentary would have been fun too though). Segel's endless, joking Disney plugs are pretty delightful. There's a ton of joking, but we do get insight into the film as well.

Oh, and before I forget, this Disney Blu-Ray is equipped with something new, ""Disney Intermission"". This new enhancement has its good and bad points. Basically, when you press pause in a film, the screen switches to an intermission mode in which you are entertained by teasers from the bonus features. This is actually a great idea, and you can press pause a second time to pause the intermission mode if you don't want to see it (ENTER takes you back to the film). The issue you might have with it though, is if you are pausing the film to get a better look at something. Luckily, you CAN turn off the ""Disney Intermission"", and I assume that would remedy this issue after a bit of a hassle.

All in all, this film is a must, and I believe it's something Jim Henson would smile down upon. It's of course particularly good for the Muppet fanatic, but, hey, I know someone who had never seen the Muppets before this and absolutely loved it, so I say everyone should see this! It's really great stuff! But, if I sat here pointing out all the great scenes and cameos, I'd be here all night and you wouldn't get any surprises!

4346341,3,B004EPZ03O,"I just purchased a copy of the new Muppets movie and I would like to point out something to anyone who is buying this Muppets Wacka Wacka Combo Pack.

It states that what is ""included"" is a DVD, Blu-Ray, Digital Copy , and Soundtrack. HOWEVER the Digital copy and Soundtrack are NOT included. You have to type in a code to download them off the internet, even though it says all over the packaged ""INCLUDED"" and NO mention anywhere on the box about having to be downloaded.

I just off the phone with Disney and they are aware of this packaging error , and said they would look into it and get back to me. I'm not gonna hold my breathe until I'm as blue in the face as Gonzo though.

Also if you download the soundtrack, again don't be fooled as it says ""Full Soundtrack "" but it is not. The original soundtrack consists of 30 tracks, but the Wacka Wacka Combo Box only lists 15 as the FULL Soundtrack. Yes there are 15 songs and the other 15 are dialogue from the film, so depending on how you look at it, it could be considered the full soundtrack of songs but not the full soundtrack if you buy it in the store.

The movie itself I thought was very good , even though nothing beats the classic muppets films, but still over all for any muppet fan it is worth seeing.",1332201600,8,1269,4.209876543209877
4346342,4,B004EPZ03O,"The creators of this movie made two serious ""Muppet character flaws"" in the movie, which takes away from its magic. First is how Kermit lives in a mansion. Every person who simply knows about Kermit by name, would feel odd upon seeing Kermit living in a mansion because Kermit would in no way ever really live in one. Rather, Kermit should have rather been shown as having lived in a simple home; doing so would have made the movie so much better.

The second ""Muppet character flaw"" is the suggestion by Fozzie The Bear in utilizing Fart shoes as a Muppet joke, which is also in the trailer. This is then looked down upon as not being a good suggestion by the other Muppets. The problem here is, despite being looked down upon by The Muppets themselves, is that Fozzie would have never actually considered a fart joke to be used by the Muppets. It's ridiculous and yes, it does harm the entire film. A simple editing out of this scene would make the movie better.

Combined, these two omissions would have made the movie 5 stars, and would have brought the Muppets to their glory & ""magic"" of when Jim Henson was alive, and made the other films made after his passing seem like a joke. (save ""The Muppet Christmas Carol"" which is only in line with the former Muppet ""magic"" largely in part in being in line with a famous novel) With them however, its clear that this movie is just like the others made after ""The Muppet Christmas Carol.""

My husband and I pored over reviews trying to decide whether to take our kids to the movie. We finally decided that we'd give it a try, and boy, are we glad we did! It was an excellent movie to share with our kids. All four of us were singing along to the main song by the end of the film. There were a couple of things that made us groan (a character named ""Uncle Deadly"" for example), but they were really minor and our kids didn't seem to notice. Our girls loved the movie and getting to watch something that we loved from our childhood with our children made it even more special for my husband and me.

4346529,5,B004EPZ03O,"My two favorite Muppet movies are ""The Muppet Movie"" and ""The Great Muppet Caper,"" 2 of the 4 full length movies Jim Henson made while he was alive.  Since then, there have been many short videos and made-for-TV movies that just haven't measured up.  Thankfully, Jason Segel decided he was going to take on the challenge of writing another great movie for the Muppets.  What we end up with is classic Muppet magic.

Muppet movies tend to fit into the stereotypical sappy feel-good movie format.  ""The Muppets,"" rather than trying to ignore that fact, decides to embrace it and that becomes a running joke throughout the film.  So instead of having a diabolical laugh, the character actually says, ""Diabolical laugh.""  After the happy ending, everything wraps up and the villian has a change of heart, all during the closing credits.

If you're a fan of the Muppets from ""the good old days,"" you'll find that pretty much all of them make an appearance, but we are still introduced to a new Muppet, Walter, who becomes our main character.  And, just like the classic movies, this film would be considered a musical, and we have a GREAT soundtrack.

Although, the movie is not flawless.  Even though this is a children's movie, I feel the story was a little rushed and could have easily been another 15-20 minutes.  Because of this, there were some aspects of the story that weren't fully explained in the interest of time.  The most notable being the relationship between Piggy and Kermit.  Though you could make the arguement that since this isn't the point of the film, it's not as important.

These few weak points are still not enough to take away a star.  The movie was funny, entertaining, and fit very well into the classic Muppet style.  Muppet fans, young and old, will love this movie.",1331683200,,1793,4.732258064516129

4346622,2,B004EPZ03O,"I really like the Muppets. Not only during my childhood but as an adult. Jim Henson's Muppets are very unremarkable puppets, but through his genius he gave them dynamic personalities that contrasted their bland exteriors. If you watch some of the original movies like The Muppet Movie, Muppets Take Manhattan, and Muppets in space you'll notice a subtle brilliance. The Muppets work not only as entertainment, but also as satire of entertainment in general. Specifically as a commentary of what it is really like to work in Hollywood. About the failures, the obstacles and the individuals who just haven't made it yet.

This movie has none of this. None of the spirit, the heart and the warmth.

When I heard Segal (and Adams) were involved, I was excited. Segal shows a lot of fandom towards the Muppets, but being a fan isn't enough. Much of what pours through in the writing seems like Segal's own private fantasy. Like some wild adventure he would've liked to have had with the Muppets that really has nothing to do with the Muppets. The movie never seems to be about the Muppets, but rather seems like it's about Segal, Adams and his Muppet brother. The three least interesting additions.

These problems show up in the musical numbers, which usually drag on far to long, are bland and uninspired, and feature whole chorus lines of dancing humans. Dancing humans? The original Muppet movies typically got by with incidental human interactions. The musical numbers were almost always Muppet driven. Not these. They look like something more appropriate for Hairspray.

This is confusing for me. When I started the movie I was offended by the glaring lack of focus on The Muppets. Where is the whirlwind romance between Piggy and Kermit? Where is the Rizzo side story? Where is the hilarious stand up of Fozzy Bear, or for that matter, where is the not-so-hilarious stand up of Fozzy Bear? The Electric Mayhem? I remember laughing in previous Muppet installments, now I sit anxiously waiting for musical numbers to wrap it up.

The story is cliche' at best, which isn't even a problem, but becomes one since the movie lacks any heart. The Muppets were never particularly plot driven anyways, but the characters are important, and with their noticeable absence from the plot it's forced to rely on it's weak plot and forced cameos. Cameos used to be reserved, by the by, for real talents who added to the movie's Variety Show feel, but now their just Tween icons who awkwardly try to fit in where they don't belong.

This movie, at best, is a passable musical. Sadly The Muppets are a VARIETY show, and it's that variety displayed through unique personalities who all represents various aspects of ""the business"" that made the Muppets so special. Also this movie removed the edge and grit that brought the Muppets so close to home. The overly polished atmosphere of this film gets away from the Indie atmosphere that was always present during the Henson era. The Muppets always felt like a charming low budget variety troupe' on the verge of making it, and when you have a back up crew of 40 dancers you lose that. When you lose that, you really lose the novelty of it all.

If there is any consolation in the two star review it's that I believe Segal did his best. I think the nostalgia element is there, and certainly I appreciate that he is a fan, and not some Hollywood Exec just trying to make a buck (how ironic). I think he unwittingly proved that without Henson, or a much stronger understanding of Henson, that any attempt to revive this franchise is probably not worth it. My suspicion always has been that without Henson this franchise is dead, and from the looks of it, it is. He still left us many wonderful hours of the old Muppets on DVD.

Loaded with unexpected cameos and sly winks at the troupe's long history, it's clear that a lot of love went into the making of this picture; the screen positively resonates from beginning to end.

It's been a long time since the gang were in such a major movie, and this is one of the best 'Welcome Back' movies I have ever seen.

When Gary and his girlfriend, Mary (Amy Adams), take a trip to Los Angeles, Walter gets to come along. They tour the now derelict Muppet studios where, Walter learns, an evil oil tycoon (the game Chris Cooper) plans of tearing down the studios. In a last ditch effort, Walter and Gary go to Kermit to try to get the old gang back together again. Kermit agrees and he rounds up the old gang and stages a telethon to save the Muppet studios.

The Muppets' history goes back decades, and this movie definitely coasts on the nostalgia factor of the old ""Muppet Show"" television series. A lot of that storyline, as well as some jokes and cameos, will be only for the adults and over most kids' heads. Don't think that this will divide the audience for the movie. You don't need to know everything. You just need to know how to have fun and be entertained. This movie delivers in spades. There is a lot of referential humor here and, like past movies, is littered with celebrity cameos. Some will be unknown to the kiddies (Mickey Rooney, Alan Arkin), but others will be more universal (Jack Black, Whoopi Goldberg, Selena Gomez, Neil Patrick Harris) and others. But the real draw, of course, are the Muppets. It is a joy to see these characters again in all their glory. The only disappointing thing is that maybe got a shorter end of the stick than others. Still, everyone has their moment, and it's just good to see them again. Human-wise, Segal and Adams are so likeable and game for anything in their roles. You know they just had a blast making this movie. Music-wise, the movie delivers. The new songs are wonderful, there are classic hits, and the famous Muppet song, ""The Rainbow Connection"" makes an appearance as well.

""The Muppets"" is a movie that does nostalgia right. It delivers all the watm, fond memories, but also keeps things current(the gang has to deal with how irrelevant the world now sees them as). It touches your heart, tickles your funny bone, and lifts your spirits. There have not been many movies like this in years. ""The Muppets"" is a treat. Plain and simple. My favorite movie so far this year.",1329696000,11,2895,4.468809073724008

4346628,5,B004EPZ03O,"The film spoofs 1950's musicals. The Muppets must raise 10 million dollars or lose their old studio and trade name. Like old 50's musicals, the plot has holes big enough to drive a truck through. The music was great. Numerous stars appeared in the movie and hammed it up. The cameos kept me guessing. While this is a kid's movie, much of the humor is directed toward an older generation. For instance, Emily Blunt who was in ""Devil Wears Prada"" was Miss Piggy's receptionist at her Paris larger size fashion office. Mickey Rooney appears in the small town song and dance.

This is the typical Muppet humor with the numerous asides and unexpected turns. Amy Adams and Jason Segel, the 2 human stars were less than stellar, but then again they were mostly playing a straight man for Muppets.

4346629,3,B004EPZ03O,"I originally took the stand that I would not see this film until DIsney decided to make Seasons 4 and 5 of The Muppet Show available on DVD. Since then, someone else in my household rented the film on Netflix and so I did get to see it. What a disappointment. The premise that a Muppet character, such as Walter, could be born into a human family is just a bit too hard to swallow. It reminded me of the joke in The Great Muppet Caper in which Kermit and Fozzie are supposed to be brothers - which is helped when you see that their father was a composite of both characters. At least that was plausible in a way this was not. I'm also one of those who find the voices of the characters too different from the old days. Kermit and Piggy are alright and Gonzo is still Gonzo, but Stadler and Waldorf, two of my oldest favorites, just don't sound like themselves anymore. They're supposed to be crotchety old men but they sound like middle-aged goons. I also had trouble believing that Uncle Deadly, villainous though he is, would be willing to even consider selling the Muppet Theatre - he's The Phantom of the Muppet Show, for crying out loud! There, I've done it. Treating Muppets like real people. The truth is that to people like me, they do have a real existence which was part of their charm. At least we got a bit of the real old Muppet Show with the telethon sequence, which was just too short. Though it was a fun idea, I thought it was just too cruel to take Animal's drums away for most of the film.
On a final note, one reason I found the voices so jarring was that they were even different from the ones in the recent vignettes to be found on YouTube. Any one of these is more like the classic Muppets than this film. I recommend the Swedish Chef bits ""Popcorn"" and ""Pumpkin Pie"", ""Habanera"" from Carmen, ""Carol of the Bells"" with Beeker, Animal and others, and the fantastic rendering of ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" featuring the original musical track produced by Queen. THIS is what the Muppets are really about.
By the way, even though I really don't like the movie, I do like the new character of Walter. He's very much reminiscent of my inner child and after all, he did make a plea for Disney to release the final two seasons of the old Muppet Show. He's a solid Muppet character.",1329523200,3,2290,4.365339578454333

The Muppets (2011) is a true Meta-movie; a movie about reviving the Muppets that was, itself, an attempt to breathe life back into those old fabric characters.  It holds a lot of promise - Jason Segel is a talented and funny writer, Amy Adams has been really succesfull in this type of 'fun for the whole family' movie. In fact, the whole project feels like it was brought up with a lot of love and devotion, as apposed to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/many/dp/B001QLIUS6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">many</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/many/dp/B000BKJ758/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">many</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/many/dp/B002NXSRVG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">many</a>&nbsp;other nostalgia exploiting endeavors over the past decade that feel more like they've been cooked up in cold, unfeeling offices by ad executives and money hungry moguls.  I have to admit, my hopes were high!

But the Muppets falls flat.  So flat that I'm a little taken a-back by the overwhelmingly positive reviews.  It's strange to chalk that all up to fond memories of yester-year and an overwhelming hunger to see the Muppets back in their former, razor whitted, unnappologetically insane, glory... but I can't see what else would keep your interest throughout.  It's not a bad movie, not by any means. But I can only see it being a 'great' movie if you really, really want it to be.

It's hard to point the finger at any specific problem... Oh, wait, no it's not: our three leads - Gary (Segel), Mary (Adams) and Walter, Gary's twin (?) brother who's a Muppet... or something.  He's a puppet, but maybe he's not a 'Muppet'?  Something like that.  Point is we spend a lot of time with them - the actual Muppets don't show up for maybe twenty minute, and even then it's just Kermit sounding like he's already taken his Valium for the evening.  We spend so much time following these three around and focusing on their needs (Marriage, identity, family) that it almost stops feeling like a Muppet movie and more like a mediocre kids movie about letting go and growing up.  And the worst part is that these three non-muppet protagonists were ABSOLUTELY NECCESSARY.  We needed SOMETHING to drag the muppets into the 2010's, they couldn't just show up - too much time has passed.  And that something turned out to be mostly uniteresting and unsatisfying.

The greatest failing of this new Muppet movie is that it's boring.  There are jokes (some good ones), but they're too far and few between.  The character arcs (there are character acrs: credit where credit is due) are mostly thin and hastily wrapped up in-part because there's so many of them.  The celebrity cameos are neat and sort of a novelty, but mostly brief and rarely funny.  The song and dance numbers involve more humans than Muppets and are a little too silly and kiddish to get involved in.  I was bored frequently, the kids around me in the theatre were noticably (often vocally) bored.  It was kind of a shame...

But...

What if this is exaclty what this movie NEEDED to be?  What if this is followed by two or three or even four Muppet movies not bogged down by excess exhibition or boring characters?  I should certainly mention and respect the fact that it was no small feet to (almost literally) drag these throwback chacaters of 80's nostalgia into a modern scene.  But, if they move forward with more movies (with tighter scripts, hopefully), there won't need to be any dragging at all.  They're here, they exist again, and when they get to be themselves, the Muppets are as funny as ever.  Maybe we'll all be able to look back at this one as that sort of 'eh' Muppet Movie that launched a new wave of great ones...

The original music is written by one of those Flight of the Conchords guys, so works on many levels (clever, catchy, funny).

my 2 and 4 year olds absolutely adored the movie.
i cried when the opening theme from ""the muppet show"" started playing in the theater...how amazing it felt to watch our kids dance to and feel the same magic we did when we were younger!  bravo disney for recognizing the love our generation had for henson and the realization that we would want to share that love with our children...(even if it was only for your monetary gain).
now if you could just do something with the programming on ""the disney channel""...

we own the entire fraggle collection and a number of other muppet films and my kids have enjoyed watching them, but seeing this movie on the big screen totally captivated them.  the songs were fun, and although there were more ""human"" characters in the film that the other muppet movies, it still felt like a ""muppet"" movie to me.

4346875,5,B004EPZ03O,"When I was really little some of my earliest memories were of my whole family, and sometimes our friends, gathering in front of the TV with some popcorn and Kool Aid to watch The Muppet Show.  I remember being four years old jostling around in the back seat of my dad's Ford Fiesta as he raced us down a bumpy road in order to get us home so we wouldn't miss the opening credits to a TV broadcast of The Muppet Movie.  Unlike the rest of America, we didn't have a VCR in 1984.

 I remember being at Grandma's and my cousins introducing me to Fraggle Rock which I couldn't see at home because we didn't have cable.  Consequently it is only been in the last year or so that I finally saw that whole series.

 Most of those  memories of the Muppets involve laughter and surprisingly-- my family.  As we got older, around the time I was eight or so, my sister and I didn't agree on much. She was the one who gave me the news on May 16th 1990. I remember crying until I thought my head would explode.

 The Muppets films after that- which I didn't like at the time but I found grew on me when I gave them more of a fair shot-- were not quite the same. Okay, not Muppets from Space.  Let's forget that one.  I accepted you could do a good Muppets story without Jim Henson and Frank Oz.  What I worried about was what would the loss of Jerry Juhl mean for the Muppets?

 I went to The Muppets expecting a middle grade Muppets film that my niece and nephew would probably enjoy more than I would.  Only there was an omen.  My brother in law had to race to get us to the theater on time.  I wobbled in my seat a few times.  When the movie started-- I felt the years evaporate and I became almost the same age as my nephew.

-too many scenes of people dancing, just people with no Muppets and rather bland dance numbers
-yes, it's a ""family"" movie, but the plot too, too thin
-some cameos felt forced, like someone at Disney demanded their tween stars appear, utterly painful
-oddly dark Kermit at times... not Henson humor, like blowing things up or monsters eating people, just creepy unappealing dark
-so much of the attempt at humor feel flat, at times, I felt embarrassed for the Muppets.

4346879,5,B004EPZ03O,"As much as I love Jason Segel, I wasn't entirely sure how he would do with ""The Muppets"" given that he usually works in more adult territory.  After seeing the movie in theaters, my apologies to Mr. Segel, because he did an absolutely amazing job bringing ""The Muppets"" back to the big screen!

You can tell how much of a labor of love this movie was for Segel.  ""The Muppets"" are treated with a reverance that most ""re-launches"" of franchises don't have.  All of the characters have the same characteristics and features (both physically and emotionally) that they did in the original ""Muppet Show"".  Even the situations that they find themselves in now are believable, from Fozzy performing in Reno to Gonzo owning a plumbing company to Miss Piggy editing a fashion magazine.  Even the minor characters are the same as they once were.

The best part about this movie is that the Muppets really are the centerpiece.  While there's the backstory about Segel's ""brother"" (who is a Muppet) and the relationship between Segel and Amy Adams, the focus is on how the Muppets are going to save their theater.  Even with all of the celebrity cameos (and there are a ton), you never get the feeling that Segel wanted to make a blockbuster with an all-star cast.  He knows that the Muppets are big enough stars in their own right.

The movie isn't perfect, with Chris Cooper's villain being just a little too over-the-top (the ""maniacal laugh"" joke falls flat the first time out, and doesn't get any funnier the next five) and Segel's brother being just a little too obsessed at times.  But these are all minor flaws in what really is an excellent movie.

""The Muppets"" isn't so much a movie as a tribute to a group of characters that we all grew up with.  There's a great feeling of nostalgia throughout the whole movie that adults will appreciate, with more than enough laughs to satisfy young and old alike.  Segel's homage is a very moving tribute to characters he obviously adores and also a nice way to introduce an entire new generation to the magic of the Muppets.",1326758400,8,2063,4.6602209944751385

Segel accepts that the Muppets have been left as a redundant children's toy in recent years, and decides to revive them and re-introduce them to the youth of today.  Thankfully, the adults of today remember and cherish the Muppets, and love everything they were.

Such an honest, pure form of communicating with children is refreshing in todays world, and Segel hits it on the head with every song and dance.

This is good old fashioned leave your brains at the door corn regarding the beloved marionette puppets (thus the origin of the name if you've ever wondered) and their puppet within a human world admirer Walter. Walter and his human brother (don't ask) and the latter's girlfriend go on a mission to meet the Muppets, when he learns that their old theater may be taken over by a crooked oil tycoon (note-one of the fools at Faux Noose has accused this film of promoting anti-capitalism among the kiddies-moving right along). As was the case with the band in ""The Blues Brothers,"" the beloved Muppets are scattered all over the place at crummy jobs that they hate, and Walter tries to get them together on this mission to stop the crook.

The film never takes itself too seriously. The crooked tycoon has a group of crude, pseudomuppets called ""The Moopets"" (the gangster rapping Fozzie Bear counterpart is a real hoot) that he intends to replace the lovable Muppets with. One song in the film is actually called ""Am I a Man or a Muppet"" and is sung straight (which makes it all the more funny). The song and dance numbers are jaw droppingly cornball. One really hilarious movement has a group of chickens clucking the lyrics to Cee Lo Greene's (Forget) You.

Aduilts who grew up with the Muppets will enjoy this best. Tons of self-referencing humor. There is even a segment reviving ""The Rainbow Connection"" from the 1979 Muppet Movie and ""Manomenop"" from their pre-Sesame Street appearances on the Ed Sullivan Show in the late 60s. Incidentally, a kid sitting next to us asked his parents where were Elmo, Big Bird, and the rest of the Sesame Street crew. Kermit aside, legal issues prevented this and Frank Oz (the original voice of Fozzie Bear) did not care for the fart jokes (that and a scene involving moldy fruit are the only remotely offensive things about the film, its okay for the kids) and some aspects of the script. The kiddies will have a good time though. Overall, if you don't take it too seriously and let your inner child come out while watching this, you will enjoy it too.

4347052,5,B004EPZ03O,"There is a wide spread misunderstanding on what a family film is. Most people don't know, and unfortunately it seems most movie studios don't know. A family film is not a kid movie. A kid movie is almost literally a poor man's family film.

A kid movie only sets out to entertain children, and that doesn't take much. Bright colors and upbeat music is enough to make kids happy most times. As movies go, kid movies are a pretty safe bet. They're usually cheap, quick and easy to make and usually make money. Someone may be able to prove me wrong, but I don't think there is a such things as a good kid movie. Throw a rock at a movie marquee and you'll hit about three kid movies.

A family film is a completely different animal. They are meant for the entire family, and not just trying to appeal to the lowest common denominator. They supply things that the intelligent movie goer expect to find. Characters with depth and progression. A story with a beginning, middle and end. A mediocre family film will have moments come and go which are recognizable as peddling to certain demographics. A good family film will feel as if every moment is for everyone. The Muppets is such a movie.

I expected to enjoy this movie. I did not expect to love it. Oh man, was this movie good. I don't really know how to start. Well, I guess the beginning is a good a place as any. There's a few things you could say The Muppets is about. It's a little bit of a coming of age story, a little bit of a movie about the relationship between brothers and a little bit about the relationship between a man and a woman. Or occasionally a frog and a pig.

In the first case the movie is about Walter [Peter Linz (puppeteer and voice)], a newly introduced... well... Muppet, but that's not entirely correct in the mythology of this film, as Muppet refers solely to the performers of The Muppet Show, kind of like despite popular belief every Englishman is not in Monty Python. Here's what we'll do: muppet (small `m') will refer to the Henson created puppet, while Muppet (big `M') will refer to a member of The Muppets.

Starting over. In the first case the movie is about Walter [Peter Linz (puppeteer and voice)], a newly introduced muppet who grew up watching The Muppet Show. Being the only muppet in his idyllic Real America small town, The Muppet Show gave him something to relate to. In that regard I suppose The Muppet Show is kind of like muppexploitation. As such Walter leaps at the chance to join his brother Gary [Jason Segel] and his girlfriend Mary [Amy Adams] on their big trip to LA. For Walter it is very much a pilgrimage to... Mupecca.

The relationship between Walter and Gary (not a muppet, by the way) is charming. Also a little cutesy as the two seem to live in a bit of a state of arrested development. This is for three reasons, I'd say. Gary's devotion to his muppet brother, their existence in this town plucked straight from Leave it to Beaver and lastly because I think they're both kind of man-boys. Or occasionally muppet-boy. In that regard the movie is as much of a coming of age story for Gary as it is for Walter.

Interestingly the relationship between Gary and Mary feels flatter than the one between Kermit and Miss Piggy. But that's more praise for the ability of the muppets to come across as real characters with real emotion than it is an indictment of the human performance. The human romance is given a sense of reality by the difficulty it's faced to overcome, but the muppet equivalent has very parallel themes while also being performed by hands in felt.

The Muppets does just about everything right. The cameos are just good fun. The musical numbers are generally great, one or two of them struck me as falling just below the mark, but not enough to really take me out of it. The level of nostalgia felt just about right. It plucked the right heart strings without seeming like it was excluding the younger crowd for who wouldn't understand the history. I really enjoyed Jack Black in this movie. That's the first time I've been able to say that for years. I was constantly impressed with how much character and emotion could be delivered from a puppet which so often you just don't get from computer animated characters. Hear that Lucas?

There are very many places in this movie where it could have gone horribly wrong. I think the movie is protected by that it knows what it is and knows what it isn't. It has no problem poking a little fun at itself or light heartedly breaking the fourth wall. For example, the antagonist is a very stereotypical evil rich guy. But instead of playing it straight and being a glaring fault the film has fun with it. The dude's name is Mr Richman. He doesn't maniacally laugh. He says ""Maniacal laugh.""

The movie is also very aware, and in some cases about, that The Muppets have largely been out of the public eye for a long time and that people might not care about them. I don't know how much of that was an actual concern in the making of the movie, but it seems that people have responded by saying ""Yes we do.""

I own all the movies and the DVD releases of the show (hell, I even ordered the show through Time/Life when they were sending them out on VHS). When I heard there was going to be another Muppet movie, I was really excited. Guess I'm gonna have to keep waiting.

This movie spends most of it's time focused on 3 new characters. These characters aren't very interesting to begin with, but are flat out boring in a universe where the Muppets are in the next room. The fact that their stories dominate this film leads to a long, drawn out, boring moive.

Not that the Muppets, when actually on the screen, were all that interesting either. In fact, for the most part the screen time the Muppets get is dedicated to doing old bits. If I wanted to be reminded of events of ""The Muppet Movie"", I'd watch ""The Muppet Movie"".

Another of my major complaints is that almost every conflict is resolved within a minute or two of being brought up. When on a trip to get the Muppets back together, alomst every character starts off by saying ""no"". Then the other characters ask nicely and the resisting character agrees. Characters in the film make life altering choices without any reasoning to do so besides simply being nagged into it.

The conflicts that do take longer than a minute to resolve tend to add nothing to the over-all story. Animal's conflict and resolution bring nothing to the resolution of the main plot. The story would have ended the same regardless of his choices. On top of that, since there is never any reason given for Animal changing his mind and there is no reason given that the previous choices he made were bad for him, his ""resolution"" should really be seen as a relapse and a step backward.

As for the ""villian"" in the movie, I'm so sick of the money-hungry, cold-hearted businessman as a villian. It's a tired idea and a big example of another major flaw in this movie, lazy writting.

The one shinning momment that I really enjoyed was the telethon, but that was basically a ""Muppet Show"" crammed into the movie. Once the movie focused on the title characters I really enjoyed, but it wasn't long until Walter had to step up and do something to become accepted as a Muppet (even though he already was).

Basically, this movie relies too much on lazy story-writting. Whether it be a stereo-typical baddie, vanilla main characters or flat out nastalgia, the movie never takes any risks and falls flat overall as a result.",1325894400,28,2489,4.554809843400448
4347055,5,B004EPZ03O,"As someone who is a huge fan of film(many would say im a film snob). I have seen all the classics, I see all the indie films, all the blockbusters, and foreign films. Movies are my passion. So if you told me, that a Muppet movie would end up being my movie of the year, I simply would not believe it. But this film simply works. Its a perfect movie, and their are very few movies i can say that about. Do i think its one of the best movies of all time? No, but it set out to do be a happy, fun and simple movie, and it did it succeeded one hundred percent. Never have i walked out of a movie, feeling so utterly happy about it. I saw this with my girlfriend and she agreed, it just makes you feel happy. The songs are great, the writing is great, the pacing is perfect, it never ceased to entertain me.  This is a must see.",1325808000,87,823,3.92814371257485
4347056,5,B004EPZ03O,"This movie does for Muppets fans what the first Star Trek movie back 1979 did for the original Trek fans: it attempted to bridge generations by giving the old Muppets fans like me a nice warm fuzzy blast-from-the-past and the next generation a reason to become Muppets fans.  I thought it accomplished this splendidly.  I was totally entertained throughout the movie and will likely see it again on DVD with the members of my family who were not with me at the movie theater yesterday.

Two nit picks: First, making villians of people who want to profit off of traditional sources of energy (like oil) is sooooo cliche now.  Believe it or not, being from Texas and making money by finding and bringing oil to the surface does not make a person just the sort who would raze a Muppet museum.  Besides, isn't there a lone oil well still being pumped somewhere in the middle of the LA metropolitan area?  I've been there and seen it.  It doesn't take up much space.  If Henry Ford (that evil guy who made it possible for the non-elite to own automobiles, according to Time Magazine's ""50 Worst Cars of All Time"") could move buildings from all over the world to his museum in Detroit, then ""Tex Richguy"" could probably scoot the little Muppets building a bit to make room for his oil wells, couln't he?  Of course not!  In Hollywood, being from Texas is strike one and making money from burning dinosaurs is strikes two and three.  Why not make the bad guy a developer of those tacky condo complexes that all look the same and have blighted most every once-charming little neighborhood business district in the city where I live?

But I digress.  Second, why didn't Rizzo the Rat get a little scene for himself?  I saw rats in the rafters of the old Muppet Theater but I didn't see Rizzo featured in any scene.  What happened?  This is Rizzo who was the lead Muppet for the Muppet Christmas Carol.  (Now there's a classic!)  What if Rizzo had been married for thirty years and had 100 generations of descendants living in that theater, and he got them to clean the place up.  Now that would be funny, and it would not have required so much of the movie's time in the theater-cleaning segment.  Anyone think of that?

Nits aside, a beautifully done movie that I'll likely see at least one more time, and hopefully will be accompanied with cool bonus features, like maybe that Toy Story cartoon that was shown before the movie; almost worth the price of admission in and of itself!",1325548800,2,2474,4.5646258503401365
4347057,5,B004EPZ03O,"As I sat in the theater in anticipation of seeing the return of one of the most important parts of my childhood, I was excited, but very nervous. Would it be the Muppets that I remembered? Or just a shell of what I once loved?

To my relief, not only was it the perfect tribute, but it did what I did not think was possible and was NOT a retread. Yes, there were some reused jokes and songs that all Muppets fans would love, but there was plenty of new, clever, fourth wall breaking material that had me in stitches the entire time. Being a Media Studies major, I watch a lot of films, both good and bad. This has made me cynical in a lot of regards. The Muppets made me forget all of that. I laughed and laughed and laughed and felt for every character on screen. It was the most fun I've had at the movies in a long time.

I've noticed a lot of ""reviewers"" have given the movie a one star review because it ""insults the Muppets"". This seems to be from cynical people who forget what the Muppets were about. They claim being ""cliched"" yet fail to realize the film is mocking cliches. They claim Muppets ""do not fart"" yet forget that 1) woopie cushion humor was used in The Muppet Show and 2) the whole joke was that its NOT funny. I think some people just don't realize how clever this film is. Maybe they're just not smart enough for the Muppets.

And that's what I love. Kids will love the movie, but so will adults. I can't wait to own a copy of this film and watch it with my younger cousin so she can too can meet the Muppets.",1325462400,4,1532,4.134228187919463

Now the original Muppet show was on before I was even born but I somehow managed to see a lot of them and of course the movies. They were fun then and they are still fun today.

The Muppets 2011 movie I felt was a really good homage to the franchise and added a little something of it's own to the mix. It was a little cutesy sometimes but overall it made me smile and it was nice to see so many of the old, old characters from the original show that kids and maybe even some adults won't remember but if you're a real Muppets afficianado you will.

There was a lot of cameos, mostly modern actors and it might have been nicer to see some older ones.

Overall I have to say that this is a good step in the Muppet franchise because it brings Kermit, Fozziem Gonzo, et al to a whole new generation and it would be good to see it started up again.

It's worth seeing if you're a fan and entertaining enough if you're not or if you have kids.",1325376000,,1076,3.9675925925925926
4347059,5,B004EPZ03O,"This was not an easy task to accomplish. The Muppets have been out of the limelight for many years, only appearing in  scattered television specials and even a direct-to-video release or two. Many people knew this was wrong, and Jason Segel was the person out of the lot of Muppet fans to do something about it. He knew he had the ability to do something about it. It was a huge responsibility. Not only did he have to keep the personalities of the Muppets for the older fans, but he needed to draw in a new generation of kids who grew up without a green frog and a lady pig together putting on vaudeville.

Not only did Segel succeed, but he passed with flying colors. The Muppets is a grand phenomenon.

I am a die-hard Muppet fanatic. Seeing The Muppets in the theater reminded me why. When I heard that one of the stars from my favorite sitcom was making a Muppet-comeback movie, I was ecstatic, then skeptical. The Muppets are a huge name, and 12 years had gone by since people had really seen them in their glory. Don't get me wrong, I watch the recent Christmas specials every year, and the bits on the Disney Channel are always entertaining, but the fuzzy phenomenon has not been seen by an entire generation of children. Making a comeback would be a huge task.

Before and after the movie was just as entertaining as watching the movie itself. Hearing bits and pieces of conversations of people from ages 5 to 55 was very uplifting. Such conversations I heard were the tales of Yale University having a special room dedicated to airing The Muppet Show every week, and how everyone would crowd in to watch, to little kids asking for the other Kermit movies and toys from Santa Claus. The Muppets are as alive and thriving as ever. Sitting in the theater, I could not wipe the dopey grin off my face from enjoyment. And my friends who I attended the movie with, none of whom are as die-hard as I am, thought the movie was fantastic as well.

I understand the Muppeteers are the new generation of Muppet performers who bring these characters to life, yet they are the same as they have always been. Nobody would have guessed that The Muppets had taken a more-than-a-decade hiatus from the big screen, featuring many new performers as the characters we know and love, and new characters joining them, but they all were like greeting an old friend who looks better with age, each of them individually. Seeing classic characters like big blue Thog, Wayne and Wanda, and the Mutations in the same shot as new characters like Pepe and Bobo the Bear was like viewing a great family reunion, with cousins as distant as can be, yet altogether as a family nonetheless. This movie is fantastic. It is the perfect blend of old and new characters as well as the same feel of the classic Muppets so many have grown up with. I, being a teenager, haven't ""grown up"" with the Muppets of the Jim Henson, Frank Oz, and Richard Hunt-era, but I have seen their work from early on. All the movies, DVD-released television shows, and holiday specials are up on my shelf. These are the Muppets that so many know, yet this movie is the start of the new generation of Muppets and the new generation of Muppet viewers. And this movie ranks high on mine and many others' lists.

This movie allows me, and so many others to continue with our obsession, and it does it in such a fantastic way. I will be back in the theater with more friends, to show them how the Muppets are alive and well.",1325376000,4,3468,4.4794303797468356

I have bought probably a total of 3 DVDs the past 7 years, and requested two others as gifts...Yes 5 movies in 7 years have been bought either by or for me...most of them were old classics(black and whites and musicals and a war movie) I look forward to sitting down with my husband and my two, 2 yr old boys(they all have not seen this Muppets movie) and re-watch it over and over again over the next several years, as I do with the other Muppets movies and other worthy classics!

So, what happened? Why did this movie fail at the box office. Did it have anything to do with the Fox News controversy about the bad guy being an oil tycoon. Absolutely not. This movie failed at the box office because it really doesn't have a heart. All of the muppets are there, and there is singing and dancing. Funny jokes and quality writing abound, but I never found one moment to latch on to, one moment that felt real.

I may be wrong on why this movie didn't win over the public, but you can't deny that something is missing. Maybe, the movie didn't take itself seriously enough. There are a few times when Segal or the muppets talk directly to the audience about major plot points or the movie budget.

Bottom line, this is an enjoyable movie. But it isn't the blockbuster critics thought it would be. I wanted this to be a great movie my kids would beg me to buy on video, but in the end, they liked it, then immedietely forgot about it.

4347154,1,B004EPZ03O,"I sat through this painful mess of a movie when it was released in the theatres. Honestly, I thought it wasn't possible to ruin a Muppet movie, or anything involving the Muppets for that matter, but this director and screenwriter managed to pull it off. It was so terrible I don't know where to start. Oh, let's try right from the beginning.

Almost THIRTY MINUTES to develop a main character who is a Muppet playing a human being who wants to be a Muppet? THAT'S the big lead in? It should have taken 10 minutes of screen time, including the horrific song and dance which should have been shortened by two thirds. None of these characters, the aforementioned Muppet human, his human brother and his brother's fiance' are interesting in the least. This is the best story line the author could come up with? My girlfriend and I came up with 3 better storylines, which included much more screen time and jokes for the Muppets, during the 20 minute drive back home.

The best parts of this movie required no thought, and that's exactly what it appears the author and director put into actually putting it on screen. A recreation of the old Muppets show (again, which could have been MUCH better), didn't have nearly enough gags (where was Lew Zealand? The Electric Mayhem? Pigs in Space?!?!), and wasted what could have been a GREAT guest star slot with Jack Black. The whole ""Telethon"" bit falls flat on its face. The best parts of the recreated show and this movie in its entirety are remakes of scenes lifted straight out of the Muppet Movie. The old songs, like the wonderful Why Are There So Many Songs About Rainbows, are also the best in this film. For all those who love the Muppets (including me) this was a travesty and an insult to Jim Henson and all the memories he created for us. Muppet lovers are better served by petitioning for the release of The Muppet Movie on Blu-ray and buying up copies of Muppets Take Manhattan (a disappointing second Muppet feature that is worlds away better than this mess of a film) and Muppets In Space.

When I first saw the trailer for this film, I was ecstatic. I never dreamed that someone could take a beloved franchise like the Muppets and destroy it in roughly two hours.",1324944000,17,2220,4.57286432160804

4347157,4,B004EPZ03O,"To be universally acknowledged - let alone renowned - without the weight of cultural boundaries is a feat achieved by few. Really...for all of our cultural phenomenons, how many have been pelted with incessant, albeit perhaps constructive, criticism? Even the immortal Harry Potter, our most recent and prodigious media titan, is not without his own naysayers who hiss of the irresponsibility of praising witchcraft and false magic to our future generations. Come on, I know I wasn't the only one in elementary school.

The point is this: Every titan at the cinematic forefront, every defining franchise of every era was not exempt of some subsequent backlash that, however obscure, was favored by the snowball effect as the few discouraged ones finally saw a buoy to keep their vehement objections afloat. It's happened to our young wizards and jedis; our plastic cowboys and lanky Na'Vis. And yet, if there were one crew to stand unstained, simply and quietly smiling until their names were called, it has to be the Muppets.

Nearly unmatched in their uncharacteristic nature of being both innocent and daring - clever and humble - these indefinable creatures have printed their legacy with crayons and cursive. Precursors to the Sesame Street monsters, who first appeared amidst a manic and mutating America in 1969, the Muppets first came to fruition in 1955 by the incomparable Jim Henson, who's influence has since then gone on to truly monopolize the operational puppet industry. Seemingly in their prime long after I was born, what greater testament could there be than to have myself acknowledge that I know every name and idiosyncrasy of these puppets with nary a second thought. I needed to process this before writing my review, because it would appear to be almost impossible to speculate as to how someone would respond to a muppet had they never been introduced to one prior.

Director Jason Bobin's movie is funny, touching, and wickedly aware of its own long-expired tricks...but is it a piece of good cinematic storytelling? Overall, the answer is yes, although not emphatically. To revel in simplicity is to make complexity an outlier and, for all of its charm, the best example of a joke that caters to an audience above ten boils down to frequent breaks in the fourth wall. It's worthy of a chuckle, and it certainly works towards giving this entire crew credit in understanding that they are dinosaur fossils in a new mammalian culture, but it's never unclear what this is all about and what this is all for: The kids. Take them and show them what they've missed all of these years, because there should never come a time when ""Muppet"" isn't a household name anymore.

The movie is a bittersweet recalling of the Muppets' past, with a very slim and, frankly, redundant love story tucked on the underside between Segel and Adams. I've simply come to accept that Adams works exceptionally well in these roles, while Segel's investment in the film itself shows with every earnest dance step. Beyond that...yes, there are cameos and, yes, they are welcome, but the film knows who we love, and they don't disappoint. Kermit and company stand the test of time, even if they likely cannot stand alongside the great pillars which contemporary entertainment has been built upon. And the film makes it clear that they understand and accept this. The Muppets (2011) is not a bolt of electricity intended to rejuvenate the franchise. Rather, it's a heartfelt and honest swan song that echoes good faith to those who have believed in them, and even to those who haven't.

There will never be a Gonzo on Cribz; there will never be a Miss Piggy guest appearing alongside Ashton Kutcher and his men. Kermit prefers the cool swamp waters to the limelight of Conan's stage. The Swedish Chef doesn't need Ramsey's tips to be successful. Because of this self-conscious decision to step aside, I give the cast and crew all the credit in the world. It takes guts to be so frank about the condition of one's own dynasty and, for better or for worse , I'm giving the film higher marks because of this. The themes and standards of proper film making notwithstanding, if movies are meant to entertain, then The Muppets are still succeeding after all of these years",1324166400,4,4260,4.894736842105263
4347158,5,B004EPZ03O,"""The Muppets"" is a wonderful movie that manages effortlessly to appeal to both the younger adult and mid-life crowd who watched them on TV years ago (and saw their previous films in theaters) as well as young kids who laugh at Fozzie's jokes (sometimes so bad that they're funny anyway) including the one about ""fart shoes."" The plot moves along at a good rate, never too fast or too slow; and the song and dance numbers kept me very entertained. The cameos by Mickey Rooney, Alan Arkin, Zach Galifianakis, Whoopi Goldberg and many more add to the movie's charm and excitement. I also liked the numerous references to days gone by: Kermit has a Rolodex for his contacts and no computer; there's an ""80's"" robot with that awfully annoying screeching ""handshake"" when the modem starts up; and the old posters from the days of ""The Muppet Show"" are great to see in this film, too.

When the action starts, we quickly meet two sweethearts Mary (Amy Adams) and Gary (Jason Segel, who also co-wrote the script) as well as Gary's brother Walter (voiced by Peter Linz). Gary is rather close and sometimes too protective of his brother Walter; this sometimes irks Mary because she wants romantic time alone with Gary--not to mention a marriage proposal from him. Walter soon realizes that he has a lot in common with the Muppets--in fact, it turns out that he is actually one of them himself! (That may seem like a spoiler but when you see the film it's immediately obvious as Walter looks very, very much like a Muppet.)

When their coveted vacation to Los Angeles finally comes, Gary and Mary take Walter along with them to Los Angeles where Walter wants to tour the Muppet Studios and see everything that has to do with Muppets. Much to Walter's horror, they discover that the old Muppet Studios is barely alive save for a few brief tours by a burnt-out guide (Alan Arkin). Walter steals away to secretly explore Kermit's old office but has to hide under the table when people enter--and that's when Walter discovers that bad guy Tex Richman (Chris Cooper) and his flunkies plan to tear down Muppet Studios to drill for oil and incredible wealth. Walter, with the help of his brother and Mary, must then try to find Kermit or at least one other Muppet to let them know what danger their old studio is in--and what the Muppets must do to save the studio provides the rest of the plot. Needless to say, there's plenty of problems just finding and recruiting the old gang of Muppets; Fozzie is doing a really bad tribute act in Reno with the not so pleasant ""Moopets;"" Miss Piggy is working at a Vogue magazine office in Paris and Rowlf has retired quite happily.

Watch ""The Muppets"" for the nostalgia; and let your children experience the wonder of this fine troupe of puppets and actors. The plot is somewhat predictable although there is an unexpected twist or two near the very end; but through it all the film retains its heartwarming qualities and that's terrific.",1323388800,8,2962,4.670498084291188
4347159,4,B004EPZ03O,"The Muppets was incredible! While the movie is light-hearted enough to appeal to children, it also spends a great deal of its time making fun of how ridiculously upstanding it is, all the while tossing in plenty of humor for adults. It's the first movie I've ever seen in theaters where I walked out of there sure that only a monster could dislike such unadulterated greatness (my apologies to all you non-monstrous Muppet-dislikers out there. I'm sure you have good reasons).

The basic plot of this movie is genius. An oil Baron cleverly named Tex Richman is planning on buying the rights to The Muppets Studio, pretending that he wants to build a museum when really the studio sits on vast quantities of oil. He knows this because he ""Can smell it. Also, the geological surveyors said there was."" Our hero and new addition to the Muppets cast, Walter, is the only one who overhears the evil madman, and it's up to him to help get the Muppets back together for one last show so they can raise the ten million dollars necessary to buy back the studio and simultaneously prove that the Muppets still have what it takes in this ever-changing world.

The crew has to be tracked down, Animal must reacquire his inner rage in order to drum, Kermit and Ms. Piggy must reconcile their rocky relationship, a celebrity host must be secured, and Walter has to find a talent, all in two weeks!

One of the main reasons I got such a kick out of The Muppets is because it was relentlessly meta. I recently found out that this was a term unknown to my parental units, so for all you un-meta-educated out there, something is considered meta when it breaks the fourth wall. It describes that whole play-within-a-play routine where the characters are aware that they aren't real and constantly acknowledge that it's all just a show. In The Muppets, this manifests itself in a number of hilarious ways. For example, they'll have a huge song and dance number, standard for a kids' movie. But as soon as it ends, all the back-up dancers collapse in exhaustion, finally happy that the main characters are gone and their duties to the audience are over.

Even more amusing is when the two old guys (probably the funniest Muppets), read out the key details of the oil baron's contract, stating that it's fool-proof except for one minor detail. If the Muppets can manage to raise the money in time, they have first right of purchase. One old guy then says, ""It sounds like you just explained an important plot point,"" and the other responds, ""I sure hope so! Otherwise I just bored the audience half-to-death for no reason!""

The movie falls into all the traps of an easy-to-follow children's film, but it's well-aware of it, and by pointing out its ridiculousness, The Muppets can have its cake and eat it too. The kids are happy with the simplistic plot, and the adults can crack up at the way that simple plot is parodied. In fact, the entire movie is one giant endeavor in meta-narrative. The film is about the Muppets being able to prove that they're still relevant, that they can still make people laugh. They want to show the world that in a time when television and film are shifting toward either the unintelligent, irreverent comedy of things like Dinner of Schmucks, or the dark gritty edge of new superhero reboots, the wholesome and clever entertainment of the Muppets still has a place. Children are not as stupid as we think, and the Muppets believe they deserve well-written film with a positive message. In this case, that is the message, and The Muppets proves its point with every top-notch joke and clever spoof.

As you watch the film, you're sure to enjoy it, and that very fact proves the film right. Realizing that will make you enjoy the film more, thus proving it right further. They've managed to create an endless feedback loop!

As always, Jason Segel is eminently lovable, and his man-child character is no different here. He plays Walter's brother, and his conflict is that he cares too much about his furrier sibling, sometimes accidentally ignoring girlfriend Amy Adams. Chris Cooper's Tex Richman is a fantastic villain, and his one song catches you totally off-guard, then proceeds to be hilarious. In fact, with the exception of one Ms. Piggy/Amy Adams duet that I found slightly off, the songs were fantastic.

Like I said, you will enjoy this movie, and the more of that childish joy you still have within yourself, the more you'll like it. I would recommend this to everyone, and I'm doing so now (though if you're extremely put-off by kids' movies, you'll probably just find it to be one of the more excellent examples of such, rather than anything that will knock your socks off). The film deftly balances genres, managing to be a perfect kids' movie whilst simultaneously parodying dozens if not hundreds of movie conventions.

4347199,5,B004EPZ03O,"MOVIE NOTE #14: THE MUPPETS. Disney and Jim Henson Productions have presented a very timely, heartwarming (in the Muppet way) and very funny film! I have been a Muppet fan for a long time and it's was in 1999's ""Muppets In Space' since we last have seen them on the big screen.

Having loved their past features (""A Muppet Christmas Carol' 1992 and the original `The Muppet Movie' 1979 are my favorites) Director James Bobin (BBC TV's own director of `Da Ali G Show' and `Flight of the ConChords') has brought the intelligent adult humor and gags in the way only the Muppets can deliver them! Co-written by it's leading man and Executive Producer Jason Segal (`How I Met Your Mother', `Bad Teacher' and more!) created what a lot of the early expectations of this film were worried about when it was announced  which was will the Muppets work today?

 Since 1999 the Muppets have only been seen in two TV Movies, `A Ver Mery Muppet Christmas' in 2002  and `The Muppets Wizard f  OZ' in 2005 (also  the last episode of  `The Muppet Show'  (1976-1981) and `Muppets Tonight' (1996-1998)) - there was some speculation whether they could survive their former popularity. Guess what - They do and they did!

Jason Segal , an admittingly GINORMOUS Muppet fan - like so many of us - thought he could develop a story that would capture all the magic of the original Muppet timing with the modern day - more intelligent - audiences of today. It basically is the story of two brothers - Garry and Walter. One human (Gary is Jason Segal) one Muppet (Walter is masterfully voiced by Peter Linz who has been a Muppet puppeteer and voice for the franchise since 1999).

Gary and Walter are dear brothers and each of them have to deal with where they belong in their respective lives. Gary wants to take his relationship with Mary (hysterically played by Amy Adams - `Enchanted', `Julie & Julia') to the next level - and Walter just wants to visit the Muppet Studios (now deflated and in disrepair) only to discover the Muppet legacy is doomed for destruction by the evil Tex Richman. Tex is played surprisingly convincingly by Chris Cooper (`Jarhead', `Seabiscut' & `American Beauty') who even surprises the audience by Rapping a song. Yes...rapping!

Walter, Mary and Gary set out to do the only thing they can - tell Kermit - The Frog. What's going to happen? Kermit is broken hearted in what to do. There is a deadline, obstacles and challenges for the Green Amphibian as he reunites - hysterically - the old gang. Everyone is back with the exception of Miss Piggy. The reason she doesn't want to help become clear...and even understandable. (That's all I'll say about that!)

The movie is sprinkled with the perfect amount of song, dance numbers and `Muppetisms' that make the story, fun, adventurous and even heartwarming.
The songs are memorable, story driven and in some cases great nods to songs like Academy Award winning ""The Rainbow Connection' from the original film. In fact - that song even peaks its head in this film in a most appropriate way!

All the voice talents are brilliantly back!
Steve Whitman - (as Kermit / Beaker / Statler / Rizzo / Link Hogthrob / The Newsman)
Eric Jacbson - (as Miss Piggy / Fozzie Bear / Animal / Sam Eagle / Marvin Suggs)
Dave Goetz  - (as Gonzo / Dr. Bunsen Honeydew / Zoot / Beauregard)
Bill Barretta - (as Sweedish Chef / Rowlf / Doctor Teeth / Pepe the Prawn)
David Rudman - (as Scooter / Janice / Miss Poogy)

Also, as there are in all Muppet movies, tons of cameos including; Adam Arkin, Bill Cobbs, Zach Gaifianakis, Ken Jeong, Sarah Silverman, Emily Blundt, Rashida Jones, James Carville, Whoopi Goldberg, Salena Gomez, David Grohl, Neil Patrick Harris, Judd Hirsch, John Krasinski, Rico Rodriguez, Mickey Rooney and many more! An amazing (and hysterical) surprise was where they cast `The Big Bang Theory's' own Jim Parsons! Wait till you see where he is!

I think the late Mr. Jim Hensen would really love this film. If you are a fan of these felt-covered puppets - the movie delivers everything you expect - laughter, fun and warmth that can only be The Muppets. If you are not a fan, you will become one because the humor is intelligent, sarcastic and witty and this will put a smile on every family members face. This is my favorite comedy of the year! I was pleasantly surprised and you will be too!",1323043200,5,4346,4.652741514360313
4347200,5,B004EPZ03O,"It takes a special movie to make me get fired up, to make me cry, to make me laugh, and to make me feel genuinely happy. It takes an even more special movie to be absolutely perfect, from top to bottom, in terms of acting, direction, effects, sounds, and music. A movie like this doesn't come along all that often, and when it does, I shout it's praise from the rooftops. And I cannot think of a more perfect movie to shout praise towards than Walt Disney Picture's The Muppets, which is undoubtedly the best film I've seen all year.

This loving revitalization of Jim Henson's legendary creations kicks off with Gary (Jason Segal, who puts on his best good-boy act here) and his younger brother Walter (a Muppet), who have both been lifelong fans of The Muppet Show. Along with Gary's girlfriend of ten years, Mary (a charming Amy Adams), they travel to California to see just where the Muppets have been since the cancellation of the show. The answer isn't pretty. Kermit is a reclusive shut-in, living in a house built for him and Miss Piggy, who has now given up her beloved frog for a fashion magazine in France. Fozzy is cracking bad jokes at a sadsack casino with a Muppets cover group, Animal has attended anger therapy classes, and Gonzo runs a plumbing business. But the whole gang has to be brought back together for one last show in order to save the Muppet Theater, which is about to be torn down and tapped for oil by tycoon Tex Richman (Chris Cooper at his menacing best.)

The Muppets would have been an easy movie to turn into a tongue-and-cheek parody of the source material, like 2009's Land of the Lost. James Bobin, of Da Ali G Show and Flight of the Conchords fame, could have easily pulled off putting sexual themes in different shots. Jason Segal and Nicholas Stoller, who have teamed up for R-rated comedies like Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Get Him to the Greek, could have put in subtle pot jokes to elicit laughs from people old enough to get them.

However, they didn't. What they did do was make a pure, light-hearted movie that captures everything you've ever loved about Jim Henson's creations, and amplifies it to the umpteenth degree. They've taken the characters we've grown up with and made them more modern, with added layers of pathos that make you genuinely feel for them. Kermit and Piggy's on-again, off-again relationship no longer feels like a running gag, but comes across a genuinely real affair. Hell, even Animal's love of drumming comes across as a primordial desire that he's destined to fulfill. I never thought I'd be saying this, but the Muppets feel like real people.

That's especially true for newcomer Walter, who idolizes the Muppets for the way they make him feel empowered and normal. The story between him and Gary is perhaps the crowning achievement of the movie, as he learns to stake out his independence and uncover talents he never knew he had. Jason Segal reacts remarkably well for somebody acting side-by-side with a puppet, conveying a true sense of brotherhood with Walter. That sibling bond is one of the movie's driving strengths.

Another strength is just how damned innocent the whole affair is. As I mentioned, this isn't a ""modern reboot"" of the Muppets. It's a Muppet movie made with modern technology and actors, still holding onto the same sensibilities that were on display back in 1979's The Muppet Movie. You've got your music numbers, which are very infectious and will surely be lodged in your skull for weeks. You've got your good-natured humor, which is easily grasped by children and still uproariously funny to adults. But most importantly, you've got your strong moral when all's said and done.

Most movie morals are pretty simple, but special attention should be drawn The Muppets' excellent message to kids and adults at the end. That message, without spoiling too much, is that there is honor in losing. As long as you're willing to pick everything back up again and stick by your family and friends, you have a fighting chance, no matter how hard you're kicked down. And even if you don't win, you've at least got people who'll stay by you until the very end. That type of moral has been seen in movies like Remember the Titans and Friday Night Lights, but rarely in a film with puppets geared towards kids.

And it's a moral that applies to The Muppets as well. Opening the same weekend as the utterly dreadful, but sadly bankable Breaking Dawn Part One, Jason Segal's love letter to his childhood may not come in first this winter. But it's put up a better fight than any film I've seen in a while, and shown such effort at crafting a purely entertaining and heartwarming experience that I can't find fault in it. Out of everything I've watched in theaters this year, this has been the only movie to make me walk out feeling completely fulfilled. It is utter perfection, one of the best films I've seen to date.

And with that being said, then it should be entirely clear that The Muppets is the best movie I've seen this year. Run, don't walk, to your local theater and shell out the money for this charming, heartwarming, and hilarious landmark.

4347201,4,B004EPZ03O,"What was supposed to be a romantic anniversary between Gary (Jason Segel) and  his girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams) turns into a trip to bring the Muppets back together, when Gary brings his die-hard muppet fan brother Walter along ""who's also a Puppet/Muppet"".
  Together, they must stop Tex Richman (Chris Cooper), a greedy oil tycoon, who wants to get rid of the old Muppet theater to drill for oil. The Muppets have to re-unite and put on a telethon show to bring in enough cash to save the theater. However, due to old relationship problems between Kermit and Miss Piggy, bringing Piggy back might be harder than expected and finding a celebrity host for their show is also much harder than Kermit expected.
  The Muppets marks the return of the beloved puppets that  haven't been on the big screen since the 1999 film, Muppets in Space. There's plenty of entertaining songs ""such as, Am I Man or a Muppet ?"", celebrity appearances ""like,  Zach Galifianakis, Emily Blunt, Neil Patrick Harris, Jim Parsons, Alan Arkin, Sarah Silverman,  Selina Gomez and Jack Black""  and a faithful story to keep Muppet fans and new audiences entertained.
  Screenwriter and star Jason Segel (Forgetting Sarah Marshall, How I Met Your Mother), due to his love for the  Muppets has given us a surprisingly charming, smart and funny Muppet film, that is one of the best in Muppet franchise. Critics would agree, since the Muppets is one of the best rated films of the year, so check it out, but be warned, a lot of the songs might get stuck in your head for days.",1322870400,3,1543,4.7164179104477615
4347202,4,B004EPZ03O,"I was never a big fan of The Muppets, but this movie is special. It gives a nostalgic vibe and an ultimate comeback for the Muppets. I loved the references they made to their tv show, and their previous movies. The jokes were hilarious. The musical numbers were decent. While growing up, Gary and Walter (who is actually a Muppet himself) become obsessed with The Muppets Show. Gary plans a Hollywood Anniversary vacation for his girlfriend, Mary, but Walter comes along too to see the Muppet Theater. When he hears that Tex Richman plans to destroy the theater for oil, Walter tracks down each of the Muppets to help raise $10,000,00 to save the theater and put on the ultimate Muppet Show. Join Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo, Animal, Rowlf, Swedish Chef, Rizzo, and the rest for the biggest comeback in Muppet history. If you grew up with the show, you'll definitely love THE MUPPETS!!!",1322524800,3,892,4.7612903225806456
4347203,5,B004EPZ03O,"When I first saw the trailers for the new Muppet movie simply titled THE MUPPETS, I was worried. Let's just say the Muppets haven't had the best track record since switching over to Walt Disney Studios ownership. Or for that matter, since the beloved Jim Henson passed away. And while THE MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL and MUPPET TREASURE ISLAND were decent pictures, they really could never match the magic of the 1979 THE MUPPET MOVIE or THE GREAT MUPPET CAPER even. And as the years passed from the abysmal MUPPETS FROM SPACE, I wrote off any future Muppet releases ever being good again.

Until I finally caved and went to see THE MUPPETS with a friend. And I am so glad I did. Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller have really delivered an amazing script that takes viewers back to what Jim Henson had always hoped the Muppets would bring: that wonderful happiness melded with a childhood nostalgia that really doesn't fade away after the credits roll.

The story begins with bright eyed Gary and his Muppet brother Walter who are planning a trip with Gary's girlfriend Mary (played by Amy Adams) to Los Angeles. While there, Muppet fan Walter plans on visiting the Muppet Studios. But when the threesome arrives, they discover the entire place is completely abandoned and rundown. But that's also when they discover that an evil oil baron, Tex Richman (Chris Cooper) plans on destroying the Muppet Studios and drilling for oil. What ensues is a wild romp to regather the Muppet family and put on one last show to raise ten million dollars and save the Studios.

The best part of this entire venture is how the Muppets can get away with poking fun at themselves while remaining completely innocent in doing so. The best jokes come from moments where we find out what has happened to all the Muppets -- and the constant poking at not being in popular culture any longer. It's absolutely perfect. I found myself laughing harder than any kids in the audience as small moments popped through referencing previous films and THE MUPPET SHOW itself. From the wonderful 1980's Robot using its modem to the offbeat ""Moopets"" -- replacements for the original Muppets -- the humor is spot on.

The music is spectacular. It really harkens back to what Paul Williams used to do not only on THE MUPPET SHOW, but also in THE MUPPET MOVIE. The dancing and singing is well executed and I kept feeling amazed at the song lyrics. Not only are they great musically, but the writing was smart and never clich&eacute;. And as the opening number, ""Life's A Happy Song"" begins, I could not stop smiling. I knew it from those first moments: the Muppets I knew and loved were back. And hopefully this time for good.

Acting is top notch -- as Amy Adams and Jason Segel play bright and cheery adults who never come across as being cornball. It definitely has a hair of camp factor, but Adams and Segel pull it off brilliantly. The cameo performances are perfect -- never overwhelming, and always at the right moments. Some are definitely highly laugh-worthy, such as while Walter sings through his conflicts, a human version of himself appears in the mirror played by THE BIG BANG THEORY's Jim Parsons.

Be warned: there are not only numerous moments of laughter, but also some tear-inducing moments. Such as when Kermit walks around his empty mansion and reminisces on the past. THE MUPPET MOVIE inspired me as a kid in so many ways, and THE MUPPETS has the power to do that for a whole new generation of kids. And I know that this is exactly the sort of film Jim Henson would be extremely proud of. I know I am. And for all the lovers and dreamers who grew up on The Muppets, this is not a film to miss.",1322352000,4,3671,4.622699386503068
4347204,5,B004EPZ03O,"The Muppet's last movie, ""Muppet's from Space"" was released in 1999 and ""The Muppet Show"" finished its television run in 1981 and this is the premise of the ""Muppets 2011"" revival movie. After years of absence, the Muppet's are back. For many people who grew up in the late 70's and early 80's, this isn't just a children's movie, this is a return to their childhood. Those who remember ""The Muppet Show"" will be reminded how a collection of felt characters with all different personalities, would attempt to put on a variety show every week.

""The Muppets"" 2011 is an absolute delight for a child who hasn't been exposed to the characters yet, as well as the child at heart who was longing for their return and didn't even realize it. The spirit of the Muppets is quickly established with a lighthearted delivery, song and dance and doing what the Muppets have always done by making puppets made of felt and cloth come to life. We are introduced to a Muppet named Walter who's brother, a human, changed and grew over time, while he stayed his same old Muppet self. Ever since the television show left the air in 1981, Walter had longed to be a part of a television show that was put on by people, or Muppets, like him. Out of place and never having his dream fulfilled, he finally gets his chance.

The new movie is a collage of real life and movie. In the movie, we watch as the Muppets who have had a 12-year hiatus and are leading private sector lives, come together to bring back their television show and that is exactly what is happening in real life. The Muppets are back! There are moments in the movie too that made me feel how much I missed them. There are also moments that made me think of how the creators, Jim Hensen and Frank Oz are also gone and can't see how much the Muppets meant to us growing up.

""The Muppets"" is quite simply a joy worthy of repeat viewing. There are people who break out into song and dance at the most inappropriate times, like sitting at a diner or chickens clucking to C-Lo Green's ""Forget You"". The songs are catchy. The story is fun. The Muppets personalities are just like we remembered them. It was like dusting off an old record and letting yourself go. I had almost forgot how long it had been since a movie had done that to me.

The only thing I can say negatively about ""The Muppets"" is that it will leave you with a sense of disappointment. It is inevitable, especially for those who remember the show. Although it is disappointment in a good way because you know how much there is to the Muppets and you can't help but want more. Hopefully there will be more and hopefully they will continue to bring the Muppets back into our lives on a regular basis.",1322352000,9,2706,4.41683366733467
4347205,5,B004EPZ03O,"The Muppets is an excellent family film.  The plot is simple.  An evil land developer played by Chris Cooper wants to tear down the Muppet theater to drill for oil.  It is up to the Muppets to raise money and  put on a telethon talent show to save their beloved theater.  The problem is that all the Muppets have gone their separate ways.  Jason Segal and Amy Adams star as Gary and Mary.  They play boyfriend and girlfriend.  They have great chemistry on the big screen.  I really believe these two people are in love.  Gary's brother is a new Muppet named Walter.  He has a talent for whistling  that he shows in one of the most uplifting scenes of the film.  There is a lot of humor in this movie.  It  comes from the other Muppet favorites like Fozzie Bear and Animal, but all of the Muppets shine in this movie about team work.  Every Muppet movie has celebrity cameos.  This movie has cameos from Neil Patrick Harris, Jack Black and Selena Gomez.  One of the fun things about this movie is trying to see how many celebrities I could recognize.

  The music is the strongest aspect of the movie. The film contains the songs ""Me and Julio Down By The Schoolyard""  and ""We Built This City"". I love these songs from my childhood.  This film also includes the new tune ""Life's A Happy Song"".  The movie also contains the classic Muppet show theme and my favorite tune ""The Rainbow Connection"".

4347207,5,B004EPZ03O,"I was a HUGE Muppet fan when I was a child, to the point where I nearly wore out the tapes of the three original movies (especially The Muppets Take Manhattan -- that one was my favorite!). I've dutifully watched nearly all of the Muppet movies that have come out over the years (...although I think I've missed a TV special or two), and was initially thrilled to hear that there was going to be a new movie.

And then the trailers started to come out -- and they were funny, yes, but they also made me somewhat uneasy, because the scenes they showed, out of context, just weren't selling me on the movie at all.

Still. I am a Muppet fan, so my seeing this movie opening weekend was never in any doubt. Especially after the stellar reviews started coming in. And you know what? The reviewers were right.

So the basic story is: Gary, his girlfriend Mary, and his brother Walter (a puppet, who is the Muppet's biggest fan), take a trip to LA -- ostensibly for Gary and Mary's anniversary, but also so that Walter can see the Muppet Studios. While Walter is on the tour there, he learns that an evil businessman is going to buy Muppet Studios and tear it down and drill for oil. So, Walter and company set out to reunite the Muppets (who've been retired for years) so that they can put on one last show and save their old studio.

This is a fabulous piece of nostalgia. It is sweet (and occasionally bittersweet) and funny and it had me alternating between smiling and tearing up from moment one. This is everything that made the Muppets so wonderful years ago, and was, in this Muppet fan's opinion, pretty much perfect. As cliche as it sounds?
