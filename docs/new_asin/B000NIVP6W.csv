8178003,4,B000NIVP6W,"This DVD (I also have the accompanying book, as well) was a bit disappointing. It is nicely put together and professional in presentation. My disappointment is with the lack of group FUN activities suitable for varying ages and abilities in the water.  It seemed more like a disguised exercise video for teens.  The relay ideas are good. I just expected it to be as FUN as the picture on the cover seems to portray...as if something new and clever can be done using noodles....
Not bad if you are new to aquatics and need a few tips for encouraging older kids to use their bodies in the water to increase their fitness abilities while having fun.",1310083200,,646,4.560344827586207
