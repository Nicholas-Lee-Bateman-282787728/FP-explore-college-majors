3145109,5,B0015I2S10,"Heartwarming and truly funny, this movie is a tour de force that has found it's way into my permanent movie library. How it slipped by without more attention is anyone's guess why (no CGI), but here is a movie that actually has good writing and amazing humor to carry it through. Excellent.",1222387200,,290,4.596153846153846
3145110,5,B0015I2S10,What a great movie to watch with friends.  It's a very creative story following captivating charactors meeting in separate cars during a lunch hour in a park in LA.  William Bauldwin is hilarious with great performances by all the actors.  Belly laughing will start from beginning to end.,1213833600,7,288,4.958333333333333
3145111,5,B0015I2S10,"Park is great film and a comedy that can hold it's own with much better known fare.  From a nudist lunch date in a van, to a SUV bashing that will make you feel a little bit better about $4 gas, Park has it all.

The comedy is alternately sly and outrageous, and the characters never fail to surprise you in new and funnier ways.  Look for some famous names behaving badly, and for some lesser knowns turning in pivotral performances (dog groomer/tow truck driver).

Park won't dissapoint.  You'll love it.",1212969600,10,506,4.516483516483516
3145112,5,B0015I2S10,"I absolutely loved this movie.  I first saw this movie at OutFest in Los Angeles and was so pleasantly surprised - it was hilarious and the audience went crazy for it.  I am so happy it is now out on DVD because it's one of those movies that you can watch over and over again.  The characters are real, hilarious, and so well-written.  You've never met anyone like them.  Unlike most movies out there, you have definitely never seen one like this before.  It is unique and fun.  I highly recommend it if you feel like laughing for a couple of hours.",1212624000,7,549,4.323529411764706
3145113,5,B0015I2S10,"I am so happy that this movie is finally out on DVD!! It is a smart funny movie that will make you laugh out loud. The dialoge is witty and everyone will be able to relate to at least one the characters. I also loved the soundtrack, it will make you think about ""We've Only Just Begun"" by The Carpenters in a whole new way. Spend the $20 to buy it and enjoy!",1212537600,6,358,3.9178082191780823
3145114,5,B0015I2S10,"My husband and I sat down to watch this movie, as it came highly recommended by a friend.  We both we are little unsure when we read about it, but decided to give it a chance.  He is a much tougher critic than I - but we both really enjoyed it.  My husband had nothing but good things to say about it (and never said he thought it was a chick flick as it had been called in another review (""quasi-chick flick"")).  We agreed that it was a terrific movie and it was one of the better movies we have watched in a long time.  I felt that there were elements we could relate to, many times when we were laughing, and it kept us genuinely entertained for the entire movie.  What more could you ask for?",1212537600,7,696,4.043795620437956
3145115,5,B0015I2S10,"I do not remember ever laughing so hard during a movie. I enjoyed this movie so much!  I have watched it multiple times with family and friends and each time I laugh outloud at something new. My cheeks hurt from smiling so much.  It was by far the best money I have spent for a movie to own. Sit down and enjoy yourself by watching this movie and surround yourself with your friends. You all will be rolling! I found the writing to be very cleaver.  I keep saying to myself, ""It's about decency, forgiveness, and love.  You  stupid-@$$, fat-headed motherf##ker!""  That is one of my favorite lines of all time! I think the casting was great too.  I wish I could give it more than a 5 star.  I know what to watch or suggest to watch if I ever need to smile or know someone who needs to smile.  I also want to applaude who ever made the decision to make the movie in Los Angeles.  I know that movies get made outside of the USA for financial reasons. It was nice to see this PARK in LA.  Overall, very well done!!!",1212537600,9,1011,4.15979381443299
3145116,5,B0015I2S10,"A friend recommended this movie. What a surprise!

I was really entertained by the straightforward storyline. But, most of all, I LOVED the characters and casting. The female characters were smart and witty, leaving the males looking a little like dunces and frauds. Very satisfying.

A great look at LA...the real LA....in a real (gritty) LA PARK.

Highly recommend!",1212537600,6,367,5.186440677966102
3145117,5,B0015I2S10,"I'm so happy this film is finally out on DVD. I caught ""PARK"" at CineVegas (where it won the ""Audience Award"") and let me tell how refreshingly funny this film is! As festival-goers know, the films that are ordinarily programmed at most fests tend toward somber, turgid and suicidal.

Not so with ""PARK"". They crowd was howling with laughter throughout the film. The Baldwin puts in a hysterical performance as an Alpha-male who arrives for a rendezvous with the uber-hot Izabella Miko: latex gloves, french maid outfit, say no more. Cheri Oteri & Ricki Lake give new meaning to the term coitus-interruptus. Suffice to say, it's a ""nooner"" you'll not soon forget.

Fortunately for comedy-lovers, what happened in Vegas didn't stay in Vegas. This is one DVD I'm going to own!",1212537600,6,774,4.900763358778626
3145118,2,B0015I2S10,"Four stories that eventually intersect.  1) A girl drives to a remote overlook in Los Angeles, ready to take her life.  Will she succeed?  2) Two pet grooming service workers passes by in a service truck: an unattractive man and an eastern European gold-digging hottie user, who wants to land a man equal to her stature in looks and cash in on the rest.  She has arranged to meet with Dennis, a big man with a really big SUV to compensate for something really small under his hood.  3) The man's wife and her friend follow him and spy on him.  They have a plan for payback if she can catch him in the act.  4) Two male and two female co-workers spend lunch in a company van.  The girls suspect the two guys are gay, but they confess to being something else altogether.  What further secrets will be revealed and more importantly, who will be dared into doing something to settle a philosophical debate about our society?

The movie tries to pull off a Joe Orton / Four Rooms intersecting situational comedy.  Instead, what we get is a quasi-chick flick that never quite takes off.  I say this because 1) The female roles contain long monologues that reveal what is going on inside their minds, while the male roles are completely flat and stunted in dimension.  2) No matter how good or nasty (in a bad way) a person was, each straight girl ends up with a hot sexy hunky stranger (who incidentally, speaks very little) whisking her off to a happy ending, while the nasty guy gets dealt his full comeuppance.  3) Hot English guy with gratuitous British accent that American girls go ga-ga over.

A girl comes to a realization in her life, then dumps her best friend (who helped her discover and arrive at that realization ) leaving her in the middle of nowhere to her own devices, while she drives off to pursue her dreams.  It's difficult to root for characters who are this self-absorbed in their own happiness.

Whoever made this movie really has it in for SUV's, as the automobile becomes a target for all the trite cliches behind why anyone would want to drive one.",1212364800,7,2069,4.50402144772118

8258712,5,B0015I2S10,"One of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  I feel sorry for that Park if these are the types of people that normally come visit during lunch hour.  Now whenever I go to my local Park to walk my dog, I notice all the cars parked with people sitting in them and it makes you wonder.......  are they as insane as the visitors in this movie??  As is normal for an Indy movie, there is a lot of talking about esoteric and highbrow type things.  But some of the interactions of the various personalities will have you splitting your sides with laughter.
Not much in the way of extras on the DVD (and I do wish I could find it in Blu-Ray), but there is a scene selection and 6 very funny deleted scenes.  I know I will watch this movie over and over just to catch some new things each time.  And of course, laugh hysterically till my sides hurt.",1441324800,,841,4.154320987654321

8258716,5,B0015I2S10,This movie is so subtly HILARIOUS! Characters are all unique and interesting and dialogue is raw and fun. I'd recommend this film to anyone. Its a shame it didn't get more publicity. Awesome movie!,1308096000,,197,4.823529411764706

No doubt it will hit the right notes for some people while making no sense at all to others.  Park does take a swipe at giant SUVs so if you regard them as something positive you may take offense.

8258719,5,B0015I2S10,"I've known (and experienced) Parks like the ""Grabsome Park"" shown in this excellent film.  I'm afraid that many Viewers will rate the film based upon their own similar experiences, rather than the film's plot-line and specific situations.  We all allow our personal experiences in life to season our reviews, but that doesn't mean that a non-cheating person who has not be attacked in an SUV can't see the hilarity in that situation occuring.  Hahahahahahaha...

I doubt that anyone will experience an epifany watching this film, but a good time will be had by all if you loosen your tie (or bra, as the case may be), forget any minor personal problems and let this ""fluffy"" diversion work it's magic on you.  Fun, fun, fun!

To my knowledge, there isn't a sequel planned, but think about the situations that could be afforded the story after night fell on the Park.  Oh my.",1256428800,,874,4.748344370860927

Bad acting and weak attempts at humor finally made me skim through it - something I very seldom do. I finally just erased it and went to bed.
