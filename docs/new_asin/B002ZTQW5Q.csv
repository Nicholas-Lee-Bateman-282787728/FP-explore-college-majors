4042619,5,B002ZTQW5Q,"This is not a critical analysis of any aspects of the Christian faith, it is merely an in-depth look at how Christianity developed through two thousand years.  It is not extremely deep, it is not controversial, it is not inflammatory in any way.  This one is geared toward a conventional Christian audience and they do a very good job of laying out an awful lot of history - as such, it gives just the basics of most elements, but, there's a whole lot of ground to cover.

VERY long series but well worth watching.  My only ""complaint"" if you will is that Ossie Davis's voice overs are so smooth and peaceful (fantastic voice) that I kept nodding off even though I was very interested in the program!  I watched these discs forty minutes to an hour at a time, and I had to go back and rewatch a lot of the parts because I kept falling asleep!  Not boring, the guy's just got a very soothing effect on you when you've had a long day at work!

Highly recommend this set, get it while you can in this affordable double disc set.",1274140800,47,1025,4.307291666666667

4042642,3,B002ZTQW5Q,"While I appreciated the vastness of its scope, I thought the DVD omitted the very significant role that women have played in the spread of Christianity, especially Catholic Sisters.  For example, while the DVD rightfully portrayed the Jesuits as playing a major role in the Catholic Counter-Reformation, it said nothing about the Ursulines who were doing very novel ministry at the same time, namely, educating GIRLS in many hundreds of schools throughout Europe.  (In France alone, there were 350 Ursuline schools at the time of the French Revolution.)  I also thought that the DVD portrayed Catholic missionary work too negatively, while portraying Protestant missionary work very positively.  Having said this, I found segments of this DVD to be very useful in my teaching of church history.",1425427200,7,794,5.277777777777778

4042644,4,B002ZTQW5Q,"A nice general introduction to Christianity.  Gives enough detail about how Christianity developed and the various crises in a digestible manner.  There is an attempt to show the positives and negatives, including how the Catholic Church became very conservative in response to industrialization and cultural changes in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and the Christian churches role (good and bad) in colonization/empire building.  Enjoyed the segments specifically on the American Protestant churches (African-American, evangelical, charismatic, etc).  You will have enough information to do more research on your own.",1408579200,8,627,6.090909090909091
4042645,2,B002ZTQW5Q,I did not like this DVD...the first of the 2 DVD set seemed to be the work of an egotist (the narrator)...the second DVD offered nothing new (we heard all about it in history class).,1379376000,,182,4.228571428571429
4042646,5,B002ZTQW5Q,"One of my favorite TV programs is Criminal Minds.  Ask yourself what does Church History and Criminal Minds have to do with each other.  Criminal Minds has nothing on the people in the first two thousand years of Church History.  Christians have done some of the evilest ugliest things all in the name of Christianity throughout history. There is nothing new under the sun.  When you watch this DVD get ready to be surprised!

Christianity: The First Two Thousand Years was very accurate and to the point.  I brought the DVD because I was taking a Church History class for my Master of Arts.  It is long, but so worth watching.  I believe that every Christian (especially Christian leaders) should know Church History.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to learn about Church History. Encourager Linda Flagg",1377216000,11,820,4.8
4042647,5,B002ZTQW5Q,"This DVD gives the historical background for Christianity which is rarely taught and a most needed perspective, from my point of view, that Christianity saved the world from paganism and introduced the world to eithical monotheism.",1366934400,11,231,5.444444444444445

There is six hours to hit the highlights of 2000 years.  I think it was very well done with good narration, interviews, supplementary archival footage and beautiful videography and beautiful music score.",1502409600,,355,4.866666666666666

8385345,5,B002ZTQW5Q,"Christianity: The First Two Thousand Years is a historical narrative of the Christian religion. It is the most complete account of the history of Christianity, drawing on ancient texts, the Scriptures, commentary from renowned scholars, and visits to sites like Istanbul's Hagia Sophia. This collection chronicles more than the events and personalities that left indelible marks on the landscape of faith, but also forces behind them. This panoramic journey through twenty centuries of belief and conflict covers everything from the crucifixion to the revolutionary changes of Vatican II.

This is definitely the best documentary ever made about the Christian religion. It is an in-depth look at how Christianity developed through two thousand years. This one is geared toward a conventional Christian audience and anyone who does not belong to the Christian religion but is curious about it.

It does a very good job of laying out an awful lot of history and it does cover it extremely well. It was very long documentary but well worth watching for it is informative and it makes you appreciate Jesus and his effect towards Christians and non-Christians all throughout the years.",1445212800,,1180,5.2712765957446805
