3556486,5,B001ENWSAC,"All first-time parents should get a copy of Geraldine Hickey's DVD, ""Saving Baby's Life,"" which delivers exactly what it promises: simple, concise, accurate, and effective instruction to help you respond to a choking, respiratory, or cardiac emergency experienced by your infant or newborn. There are differences between adult and infant CPR, but Hickey doesn't bog the DVD down with comparisons. She focuses her comments squarely on the infant's care. She gets right to the point and shares her knowledge. Clearly and articulately, Hickey describes the entire process of performing rescue breathing, CPR, and dislodging an object from an infant's airway. Every new parent should receive this type of training.",1232323200,,710,5.522935779816514

It is a valuable aid for new parents and should be required viewing for grandparents or other caregivers.  It would make a wonderful shower gift.",1226448000,2,456,4.7594936708860756

8299044,5,B001ENWSAC,"Good, suspenseful story that I couldn't put down. Read the whole book in one sitting. The author makes you feel like you're right there on the road trip with Tess and Wesley and you feel her desperation and urgency to get to her daughter. The ending brings everything together along with a lot of surprises, like the identity of the body in the trunk, who the murderer turns out to be and why --- lets just say you'll be surprised when they find and open the safe. Highly recommend.",1389225600,,482,4.426966292134831
8299045,5,B001ENWSAC,This DVD is a great reinforcement of infant CPR techiques.  We give this to NICU parents after they take the CPR course in our hospital.

8299049,5,B001ENWSAC,"I bought this dvd because I couldn't get into a cpr class before my due date.  I find it very helpful.  In fact, once I was able to get into a cpr class I found that they used this exact same dvd.  It's not long, and it's to the point.  The instructions are clear.  I'm glad I have it.  I recommend it, especially if you have a baby at home.  Knowing what to do in case there is an emergency can make all the difference in the world.",1289174400,3,433,3.852272727272727
8299050,5,B001ENWSAC,"Today was one of the worst days in my career. We responded to a 5 month old not breathing. I have a 3 month old of my own.  Horrific is all I can say.....Jonathan was his name. God bless his little soul and his parents.  We did everything we could do on our end. The hospital pronounced him dead 10 mins after we arrived.  Beautiful precious child..gone.  I'm not sure if the parents knew how to do CPR or not, as the police were doing it when we arrived. Please..prepare yourselves in the event your baby stops breathing.  This baby appears to have aspirated when he vomited lying down.  I have never taught my wife infant CPR...tomorrow I will. I also bought this DVD so she can understand it better.  Take the time to prepare yourselves...what happened to little Jonathan could happen to any of our babies.  God bless...",1269561600,,823,4.476510067114094

A great DVD to make sure anyone caring for the baby watches.,1249862400,4,346,3.8194444444444446
