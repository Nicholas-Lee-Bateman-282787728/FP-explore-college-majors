8374065,4,B002MU8EYK,"This review is for the Renown Pictures DVD. Please note that this is a Region 0 transfer, which means that it should play universally. However, the caveat in the Editorial Review section should be heeded: ""UK Released DVD/Blu-Ray item. It MAY NOT play on regular US DVD/Blu-Ray player. You may need a multi-region US DVD/Blu-Ray player to play this item."" I have two Samsung Blu ray players, and neither would play this Region 0 DVD. However, the DVD worked when I viewed it on my computer with Windows Media Player. Although not up to Criterion quality, the audio and video are fine; the movie is watchable without straining eyes or ears.

The production itself is fine. It is obvious that the story was crafted for the stage, as most of the scenes are shot in one location---the interior of a lighthouse. I was expecting the movie to be more suspenseful, but nevertheless, it is a thought-provoking drama with superb acting from the great British actor Michael Redgrave (and an always dependable James Mason in a supporting role).",1518048000,,1032,4.830508474576271
8374066,5,B002MU8EYK,"I love classic movies, and was lucky enough to catch this on Turner Classic Movies channel on basic cable television.  This movie can reach deep inside of you and make the connection between the past and today's world.",1372982400,2,218,4.7368421052631575
8374067,4,B002MU8EYK,This is an excellent film adaptation of a 1939 play.  What a shame that it isn't available for purchase in the US.  A great Redgrave performance!!,1344643200,3,146,4.576923076923077
