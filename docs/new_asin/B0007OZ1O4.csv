Evidently not ever put on DVD but I did find a better VHS copy by Simon & Schuster Video (1986).  Yes, I've held onto my VHS player!
Mona Washbourne plays an elderly woman, practically ignored by her son and his family, and in the care of a housekeeper who only looks after her own needs.  In comes Etta, played by Jean Simmons, who takes over the care of ""Aunt M.""  A great relationship develops between Aunt M and Etta.  The arrogant son and his wife lend much interest.  Anyone who has ever been in a care-giving situation would benefit from watching this.  I believe this was the last film Ms. Washbourne appeared in and that she died soon after.  I have tried to find more films with her but evidently these movies are too old to be of general interest which is too bad because she was one of the great ones.",1391040000,,963,4.190217391304348
8049795,5,B0007OZ1O4,"I have been searching for this movie on dvd for years.  The entire cast is brilliant.  The story is timeless.
It is a beautiful film with warmth and humor about a lonely woman (Jean Simmons) who visits her elderly aunt.  The aunt is bedridden due to the poor care of a hired woman. Meanwhile the aunt's 'family' is waiting for her to die, the sooner the better.  Enter Jean Simmons who, appalled at the care her aunt has gotten, stays with her, takes over her care and forms a warm and deep friendship with her aunt.  I hate to spoil the ending--I can only say I dearly hope this WILL soon be released on dvd!!!  PLEASE!!",1320969600,9,621,4.310344827586207
