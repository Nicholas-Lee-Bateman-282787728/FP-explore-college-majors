1604043,4,B00005JRMV,"If you're going to buy a children's video for your over-2 year old to watch, by all means buy this video for your two year old and older child.  I highly recommend it compared to other kids' videos because it is engaging, fun, educational and not cartoon animated or fast-paced.

Having said that, I have a beef with the title ""Baby Einstein"" and marketing this to BABIES.  It seems to imply that watching these videos is good for babies, which they are NOT!  These videos may be great for older kids, but definitely NOT for babies' brains!

After some research I found out that: 1) brain wave activity in babies is slower when watching television than when sleeping. 2) for every hour of television a baby watches a day, their chances of acquiring an attention deficit disorder increases by 10%,  3) for every hour of television viewed daily at 4 yrs old, there is a significant odds increase for being a bully later on, and 4)consistent, heavy television viewing (more than 2 hrs daily) throughout early childhood can cause behavior, sleep and attention problems.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no television for children under 2, and no more than two hours of media (tv, videos, video games & computers) daily after age 2!  I think it's important for parents and caregivers to be aware of this so they can make better informed choices. I hope it encourages some people to limit television usage for babies and look for other outlets when possible.

For those looking to calm babies and build better brains, I recommend baby carriers because studies show that infants who are carried an extra 3 hours per day cry 40% less, and this effect is lasting over time!  Frequently held babies pick up verbal skills faster and develop better core muscle strength and balance.  Also, learning to communicate in sign language can reduce frustration and tantrums, accelerate language development and promote parent-child bonding in infants and toddlers.",1200355200,,1959,4.906060606060606

1604087,5,B00005JRMV,"Not my favorite or my 6 mos old's either thus far from the BE collection but I think that's because he likes seeing kids being kids not dressed up and recognizable animals to his world (i.e. domestic cats). We're going to take him to the Wild Animal Park this weekend so maybe that'll help peek his interest further in this video. We both like the fish part the best in this video. The footage of the animals is great...however, I doubt most of the animals (especially the lions) were actually filmed in the wild thus making them appear prettier than they really are but that's fine. Overall this is a good video and can give a child more exposure to wild animals than some people have recieved in a lifetime.",1165276800,,709,4.461538461538462
1604088,5,B00005JRMV,I've purchased several of the Baby Einstein vidoes for my son.  He began watching them at 6 months and this is one of his favorites.,1163030400,,132,4.28
1604089,5,B00005JRMV,"I think we've seen every Baby Einstein video out there (most were checked out from the public library) and this is my son's favorite.  When he was younger, he loved Baby Bach, but now that he's 20 months old, he is absolutely crazy about World Animals.  This DVD includes great live action of animals playing that make my son laugh like crazy, accompanied by classical music that is typical of other Baby Einstein products.  There is also a focus on learing the names of the animals and where they live (savannah, jungle and tropics, etc.) which I can tell my son is starting to remember.  Of all the Baby Einstein videos, this one, along with ""Baby Noah"" and ""On the Go"" are my son's top 3.",1155600000,,691,4.4603174603174605

1604091,5,B00005JRMV,My daughter (and me too!) LOVE LOVE LOVE this one! The music and the sing-along song keep her attention the entire time it's on and I can keep it on repeat and she doesn't get bored. She loves all the Baby Einstein's with animals in it but this is her obvious favorite. I highly recommend this one.,1143331200,,298,4.245614035087719
1604092,2,B00005JRMV,"First, I have to say that I never expected to be putting on TV for my 2 year old.  That said, this is decent programming for little eyes.  The content is excellent, with good word association with the pictures and video on screen.  My son is totally captivated and loves to make animal noises while watching.

Now to the down side: The manufacturing quality of the Baby Einstein DVD's seems to have serious issues.  Our first copy of this DVD played to 24 min (out of about 26) then stops.  Dead! can't fast forward, rewind, anything, without starting over (and watching the included advertisement for other Baby Einstein products which they will NOT let you FF through).  We sent the disk back to Amazon, and their return process is better than I have seen to date, yet the new disk does the same thing at 22 min.  This happens on several DVD players so I do not believe it is related to the player.  I have subsequently heard from other owners that they have similar problems with this disk and others from Baby Einstein.  The problem is not always at the end like on my copy, but disks that skip, stop or otherwise do not play correctly are inexcusable in a product that carries such a premium price.

Bottom Line: Amazon will replace but is the inconvenience worth it?",1140652800,,1272,4.510917030567685
1604093,2,B00005JRMV,"We have 2 other Baby Eistein DVD's (Wordsworth and Animals on the Farm) and my 16 month old loves them, so I decided to get her another one.  I was very disappointed with the World Animals DVD.  My daughter doesn't care for it, will only watch a little at a time, nothing like the other 2 I have.  There doesn't seem to be much educational purposes to this one, doesn't do animals sounds or anything.  It just says the animals name, shows wildlife footage of it w/ classical music in the background - that is it!!

Again, disppointed.",1138579200,,534,4.408163265306122
1604094,1,B00005JRMV,"purchased Vol. 1 which is a series of 6 Baby Einstein DVDs (Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Neptune, World Animals, Neighborhood Animals)for my baby when she was a newborn. She is now 17 months old, and she has never cared for any of them EXCEPT for the Neighborhood Animals DVD which depicts scenes of familiar animals like cows, horses, cats, dogs, etc. She really loves the part when they sing ""Old MacDonald"". On the other hand, World Animals is downright boring. It feels like you're watching one of those terrible nature videos that they showed in grade school. I think overall the Baby Einstein series is over-rated. I could put on a better puppet show myself using the toys in my living room. I think a lot of folks, including myself, were intrigued by the catchy ""Baby Einstein"" name, because we all want to raise little Einsteins. I'm sure the folks at Baby Einstein are laughing all the way to the bank! I haven't seen some of the other titles like Van Gogh, Numbers Nursery, Shakespeare, etc., so I don't know if these are any better, but with all the money i'm out on Vol. 1, I won't be giving Baby Einstein another chance. We much prefer the Brainy Baby and Baby's First Impressions (predecessor of the Brainy Baby series) series of products. But, to each his own.",1136937600,,1271,4.628318584070796

The puppet segments with the monkey puppet are right at toddler level, with slipping on banana peels, making other animal noises, building (and sharing!) a banana split, etc.. The music is beautiful, and the animal footage is very captivating. My daughter is now 4, and she still likes watching this with her 16 month old baby sister. I really like the way each animal is presented with its sound, footprints, and live action footage. We have just about every video in the collection, and while my girls find them all interesting, I have enjoyed this one (and Baby McDonald) the best.

There is lots of filler in this with drawings and puppetry that I didn't care for.  I didn't like this Baby Einstein video at all.  If you want to start a Baby Einstein collection go with Baby Newton (shapes), Baby Neptune (water), Baby Galileo (sky) and Numbers Nursery (1 - 5).  That's all you need, in my opinion.

If we attempt to put in a different one he just goes to play with his toys or look at a book. His favorite part of this video are the birds and the Jack Moss song part of the DVD.  I like that part too.  He claps his hands and really enjoys the beat. I really like Jack Moss's music for kids and don't understand why other people would be so critical of it.  It's for children - not for adults having cocktails in a piano lounge.,1107561600,,546,3.8053097345132745

There seems to be too much stopping to announce what sequence is coming next - it loses them everytime.  If they kept the music going it would help, that seems to be a big part of the babies' enjoyment and when they cut it off to say, ""What animals are in the Savannah"" and then  open a little door to a  still life picture of each animal the babies' attention is lost. A note of interest this DVD seems to be the same or really close to the newest Baby Einstein:
Baby Noah.

Now that he is a year old he is much more interested!  Just needed to wait.",1100563200,,705,4.043165467625899

I purchased this along with the Baby Einstein - Numbers Nursery
DVD for my 1 year old nephew. It is a thouroghly captivating video for the child and is actually tolerable (as much as is humanly possible) for adult viewing. This is not your fathers Barney video. I definitely recomend these videos for all children.",1078099200,,379,4.6716417910447765
1604225,5,B00005JRMV,"We just got this DVD about a month ago, but it has become our 20 mo. old daughter's hand's down favorite.  ""Jane Monkey, watch it?"" is just about her most common sentence, and she talks constantly about the animals she's seen on the video.  It's also helped her learn the names of a whole new set of animals.  She now recognizes zebras and elephants off screen, too, and she's working on the differences between lions/tigers and parrots/lovebirds.  We've loved most of the Baby Einstein videos, but this is our pick for 1 1/2-2 year olds.",1068076800,,538,4.631578947368421
1604226,5,B00005JRMV,"I think it's hard to review Baby Einstein videos, because as an adult there are so many things that seem annoying or bothersome that are not so for my child. Yes, I find the kids dressed up in animal costumes annoying, but my son loves them.  The puppetry (in this one especially) doesn't make any sense to me either, but my son loves it.
We own 8 various Baby Einstein videos, some DVD and some VHS and my son likes this one as well as all the others.  We also own the Neighborhood Animals video and I don't really understand why some reviewers prefer it over this one.  They are slightly different, but my son doesn't prefer one of them over the other (at this age anyway). The only thing I've noticed is that he likes to have a variety rather than watch the same one every day (that's how our collection got so big). As a parent, I actually enjoy watching World Animals with him more than Neighborhood Animals, because I find the videos of the animals more interesting. While I would prefer to watch a nature special on PBS, my son enjoys the way Baby Einstein breaks up the footage with animation and puppetry (however corny it seems to me), it helps his short attention span out.
I do recommend the DVD over the VHS if you are choosing between the two.  The DVDs are a much better value in my opinion.  We've already begun to wear out our VHS tapes (the sound is garbled in spots now) and I love the interactive flash cards and other extras that come with the DVDs.
All in all, my son watches this video over and over again even back to back sometimes and loves every minute.  To me that says it all.",1054252800,,1605,4.298013245033113
1604227,1,B00005JRMV,"This video was lent to us by a friend of my wife's. Thank god we didn't waste our money on it. This video has way too much very [poor] puppetry, interspersed with a very little stock nature footage (probably cost them nothing) and a couple of scenes of kids in costumes ([inepensive]labour?). Our 18 month old daughter enjoyed (or, anyways, watched) the video once, but now only wants to see the actual nature footage. I don't blame her as the other parts are horrible. If you want some nature footage though, this video is not the way to go. Get something from PBS or the BBC, something that actually has educational value, not this piece of***.",1052265600,,646,4.577586206896552

Lots of corner (and time and footage) seem to have been cut.  The segments are short, and the ""digital flash cards"" on this DVD are IDENTICAL to the ones on Neighborhood animals, so you get cheated on that...

1604270,5,B00005JRMV,"This is the second Baby Einstein video I bought, the first being Neighborhood Animals. It is so colorful and eye catchy to young children. My child is 28-month's old with Autism. She normally does not like to watch videos for more then 10 minutes, but this one captivates her for the entire 30 minutes. Do not let the 101 minutes on the label fool you, that is 30 minutes of video and 61 minutes of music you can listen to like a CD. The animals are: Tigers, Elephants, Tropical Parrots, Giraffes, Dolphins, among many others all beautifully filmed in action. It is much like a really good PBS Nature show, but with each animal on the screen for no more then 5 minutes. In-between the animals segments there are puppets playing and some toys to watch- all animals of course. We love this video and it looks incredible on DVD! A must have as well as Neighborhood Animals. I just bought some more Baby Einstein DVD's and will review those as well, but the animal ones are by far the best.",1040601600,,986,4.45303867403315

She didn't seem as interested in this video as much as the Baby Bach and Baby Mozart videos before 14 months.  She would get bored with the real life video parts until she was a little older.  But as she got closer to 1 and 1/2 she started to lose interest in the Baby Bach and Baby Mozart videos and started to like the Baby Dolittle ones the most.",1006214400,,654,4.380165289256198

Baby Doolittle being the most recent addition to our collection, we couldn't be more pleased.

Now he smiles and laughs at all the puppets and animals.  I was so excited when they came out with World Animals as my grandson has enjoyed all of them thus far, and once again I was thrilled just to watch the expressions on his face as we watch and enjoy the tapes together.

Baby Doolittle is a new favorite for my older son, though.  Between the real animals and Jane the sock-monkey, he's just thrilled to watch it every time.  Of course, he loves to make the animal noises and pretend things when he's watching.  But what surprised me most was when he started to sing along to the words of the song played during the ""Sea Animals"" section.  The baby likes watching all of the animals, but sometimes think he's more entertained by watching his older brother dance around and make animal noises.  A MUST SEE for any child that enjoys the Baby... series.  And, as usual, I like to watch it too and make animal noises back.

This video is a wonderful way to introduce a child to animals and the spelling of the animals' names.

I actually purchased this DVD to replace our worn-out-to-the-point-it-doesn't-work VHS tape.  It really can depend on what your children like.  Mine giggle and talk during the puppet shows, sing along to ""swimming in the deep blue sea"" song and dance to a lot of the music.  And these 4 children are 4 unique personalities...  As an overall characteristic, they prefer the ""old"" Baby Einsteins (pre-Disney taking over the company) to any of the new ones.
