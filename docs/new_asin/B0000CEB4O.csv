7999185,5,B0000CEB4O,"Must have for any child wanting to learn sign language. It's fun and entertaining.  Also get Baby Songs by WeSign.  Avoid buying Babies and Toddlers 2 by WeSign, it's for adults, no music at all.",1358726400,,195,4.542857142857143
7999186,5,B0000CEB4O,"My 12-month old daughter and I loved this DVD!  It has great songs like ""Jacob Wore a Red Hat"" and ""Really Good Treats"" that teach you basic signing using important words and concepts like ""Stop"", ""Eat"", and ""Play"" that you can use outside of the sing-along songs.  The DVD's usage of children in the range of 3-5 year olds singing and playing with their mommies makes you feel like you are at a play date instead of in front of your TV.  It is fantastic and I highly recommend it.  If it can keep the attention of a 1-year old for more than 5 minutes, it's gotta be good.",1179187200,2,572,4.220183486238532
7999187,5,B0000CEB4O,This video is great for young children!  The video provides spoken english and sign language for both hearing and deaf children.  My son uses a cochlear implant to hear and is fluent in ASL so this video helps him to learn fun songs to sing.  He loves to sing and dance with the children on the video.  The children in the video are great signers and fun to watch.  Adults and children will have fun singing and signing along to the songs in the video!,1149379200,7,452,4.270588235294118
7999188,5,B0000CEB4O,This has been a wonderful tape to use with my toddler who has Down Syndrome.  He loves watching it (with his brothers) and everyone has easily picked up signs and everyone has fun singing the songs.  I really really recommend this to families who may feel overwhelmed by a need to learn sign language.  This will change your whole attitude.,1095033600,,340,4.633333333333334
