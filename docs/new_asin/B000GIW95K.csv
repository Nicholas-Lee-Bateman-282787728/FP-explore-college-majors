2613956,5,B000GIW95K,"Well written, well acted series. After watching a number of these stories I should be on top of guessing how each episode is going to finish.......... still working on that.

An entertaining thoughtful set of stories which do not rely upon sound bytes or visual effects to keep ones attention, just plain intelligent stuff.

Keeps one entertained and awake after a hards days work so yes, I rate this series and give Inspector frost a big thumbs up.",1171238400,13,449,4.743589743589744
2613957,4,B000GIW95K,"This series falls short of the previous episode by a star, but still is a great series to watch. The acting is superb, and the stories engrossing.",1168473600,5,146,4.444444444444445

2613959,1,B000GIW95K,"Great show as usual,seems to me they are not as long in running time.  Great acting, story, would watch every evening",1168300800,3,117,4.571428571428571
2613960,4,B000GIW95K,"This is a contination of what I believe is the best detective series ever filmed.  The standards remain extraodinarily high.  However, I gave this four stars instead of the usual five because of the political correctness that appears in the last two episodes.  In one, we learn of that a lesbian relationship is just dandy, even when there is a child involved.  In the other, the Catholic priest and a Bible spouting parishioner are the villains.  Some nasty anti-Christian commentary appears as well.  While the Frost series has always been determinedly secular, there was no call for the added attacks on the faith that has almost disappeared from England.  Except for the Catholic Church, which is the target here.",1165276800,14,717,4.974789915966387
2613961,5,B000GIW95K,"As I have stated before on this board, I've been viewing the ""A touch of Frost"" murder/mysteries for many years.  This series never disappoints in its production values, stories, intrigues and, most of all in its acting.  Seasons 11 and 12 are no exception--they are superb--great stories, great production and great acting!

David Jason, as Jack Frost is as usual simply fantastic.  Character George Toolan, as Frost's sidekick is injured and sidelined in the one disc episode of Season 12.  Jack while still solving a murder mystery involving the religiously devout shows a softer side with his intense concern for George.  It's a really intense episode and so well done.  I loved it.  In fact all of season 11 and 12 is great!

Indeed there are only three episodes on this 2 disc set; however, I did NOT feel cheated.  The quality far outweighs the quantity!",1164585600,14,861,4.835616438356165
2613962,4,B000GIW95K,"Frost is a blue collar English policeman working in an industrial city (Denton).

He is brave,hates paperwork,offers a touch of comedy centered around food.

This item contains 3 episodes-which may be the last ones,but one (Endangered Species?).

The first two episodes were enjoyable,but lacked a certain suspense. The last (Near

Death Experience)was up to the best in the Frost series. As usual,the acting,

photography and music were excellent. Sound is sometimes a little ""dicy"" which may

be due to a combination of British production values and their accent. I gave this

4 stars instead of the usual 5,for 3 reasons: fewer espisodes (3 not 4),less

suspense (1st 2 episodes),and most importantly-no ""extras""-in particular a

series wrapup commentary from David Jason,directors,etc. (Perhaps such might

appear when Endangered Species does.",1163116800,9,847,5.546875
2613963,5,B000GIW95K,We loved these movies. They were one of the best we have ever seen. In my opinion British movies are hands above us movies. British movies are all we ever buy. I just ordered a box set of a touch of frost.,1386806400,,205,3.9047619047619047
2613964,5,B000GIW95K,"Like the Brit detective TV. This entire series is good. It's quite different from the other ones, which makes even more interesting.",1386547200,,132,5.045454545454546
2613965,5,B000GIW95K,I own all15 seasons and love it. I wish there were more seasons so I could watch it forever. Best detective series.,1386028800,,115,4.2727272727272725
2613966,5,B000GIW95K,It is a great mystery series. Probably one of the best produced by British Television. Seasons 11 & 12 were up to these standards.,1380067200,,130,4.458333333333333
2613967,5,B000GIW95K,"Detective Frost is always great.  I love the pace of this series, I like the way they solve crimes without the use of guns, like every American series has (except for Columbo).",1374624000,,176,4.5
2613968,5,B000GIW95K,The quality of the scripts and the acting is consistently outstanding.  I love Mullet who seems to be able to mostly control his frustration with Jack.  The supporting cast is superior.,1372723200,,185,4.935483870967742
2613969,5,B000GIW95K,"1) Why:  Frost has little violence, and lots of wit.  Subtle humor and along the series it builds up characters with their virtues and their failures.  It has always a humane side to the stories, poor people, sad people, ambitious people, deeply unhappy people.  Kindness and noble lives where you least expect them.  And evil lives where only goodness and success is overtly displayed.  All this kaleidoscope of human existences, trying to survive in a world that they often don't understand.  Even the bad characters  are shown in their human light.
2).Compare with others:  I enjoy English police whodunit's, all of them. Poirot, Marple, Morse, Lewis, Maigret, Foyle.  Most of them share the features I described above.  I've known this series since it was first broadcast in England, where I used to live.
3)  Attributes: described in my first paragraph.",1363046400,,858,5.05
2613970,5,B000GIW95K,The ratings I assign to a movie are based on environment.  Another person might have a different opinion.  Thats why there is freedom of choice.,1361836800,,144,4.72

2613972,5,B000GIW95K,My husband and I have enjoyed the entire series of Frost episodes.  This series is up there on the level of Inspector Morse and Inspector Lewis.  Well worth watching!,1355443200,,166,4.689655172413793
2613973,4,B000GIW95K,"Inspector Frost gives a good mixture of mystey and humor. Seems our good natured Inspector is in hot water with his bumbling boss no matter how good he is at his job.  All this while trying to unravel a mystery, could be murder or some other broken law in his hometown of Denton. The building suspense and final conclusion along with a large amount of humor makes for a great evening of entertainment.
If I had any complaints it would be that their seasons are so short, some only one show. Bur I have Seasons One thru Fourteen and plan on buying many more, as long as they keep turning them out.",1351036800,,596,4.321428571428571
2613974,5,B000GIW95K,"Along with the Swedish version of Wallander, Touch of Frost continues to be the best of mysteries. I nearly have the entire series of 1-15. Well worth it, particularly if you can find a good value on ""used"" DVD's.",1344729600,,213,4.487179487179487
2613975,5,B000GIW95K,"David Jason is excellent as Frost. And British mysteries and 'murders' are among the Best of the Best. Frost is definitely one of these. Those who watch British TV or TV shows on DVD, will remember David Jason as Granville in ""Open All Hours"". ""Fetch Yer Cloth, Granville"".....",1318118400,,277,4.791666666666667
2613976,5,B000GIW95K,"For the past 2-3 years, the BBC detective shows (Midsomer, Frost, Paskoe and Dalziel, Miss Marple, MI5, Waking the Dead, The Last Detective, etc.) have been my video soundtrack while riding my stationary bike. I grind through them pretty quickly. They have to be reasonably absorbing and there are a few things that drive me nuts. With long-running series, I'm always alert for signs that the production team has run out of ideas or that ""the talent"" is losing interest or interfering with production. A lot of these are standard critiques of shows that have ""jumped the shark,"" but the things I'm always looking for are: increasingly implausible plots, replacement of departed supporting characters with less interesting characters, and, a particular warning sign, plots that ""broaden"" the back-story of one or more of the characters. Often these are the result of the actor's agent lobbying the producer for a chance for his client to ""show his real talent."" Usually these characters just aren't interesting enough to sustain the ""drama.""

Frost is one of the few long-running series that has avoided these problems. Frost has stayed the same -- brilliant, intuitive detective, bit of a maverick, disastrous personal life. The plots are always good, just enough mystery to keep you guessing without the implausible ""explain everything"" last scenes.

Frost's relationship with Chief Constable Mullet was a real challenge that every detective series with a maverick detective (going back to Rockford Files) has to deal with: how can this guy who has solved dozens of spectacular crimes remain on the ""voice of authority's"" s**** list? They handled that in Touch of Frost about as well as it can be done -- Mullet is still pretty much of a paper-pushing budget weenie, and he periodically rails at Frost about expense reports. But they avoided the pitfall of trying to keep the relationship exactly the same as it was in episode 1 and the equally dangerous pitfall of letting Mullet become a member of the ""Jack Frost Fan Club"". They broadened Mullet's character ever so slightly and let the relationship between the two become a little more complex (for example, Mullet defends Jack against outside critics once in a while), while still leaving Mullet basically frustrated and irate at Jack most of the time.

Another change I liked was reducing the ""detective sergeant of the month"" steady rotation and letting George become more of a regular sidekick. George is a really solid character and it's good that he was allowed to step a little more toward the center of the stage.

Clearly, the number of episodes per season declined as time went on, which accounts for 2 seasons in one package. It's possible that they recognized they didn't have enough good story lines to sustain a full schedule, or that the actor portraying Frost wasn't willing to commit to the lengthy shooting schedule. If so, good for them! The quality of the episodes, the acting, the production values, etc., is as high as the first season -- maybe better. That might be unique among long-running series.",1317513600,,3077,5.00390625

2613980,5,B000GIW95K,"David Jason's portrayal of Detective Inspector Jack Frost never gets old. His complete understanding of the character renders this series one of the best I've ever seen. ""A Touch of Frost"" has kept me entertained with its humor and social commentary for twelve seasons. I look forward to season thirteen. I only hope that it is not the last we've seen of Jack Frost.",1211587200,,366,4.734375
2613981,5,B000GIW95K,"DCI Frost is the most lovable character you can possibly have. Careless about his personal life, disorganized in his methods, disobedient to authority. But there's another side to this man. That side shows up when his friend George is injured in this episode. His meticulous attention to detail where a case is involved has many around him wondering how he does it so effortlessly. When I had first started watching this series, I found myself occasionally nodding off due to the slow pace of everything... the title music, the scenes, the dialogue... everything is unhurried and relaxed. It is only after I had watched 2-3 episodes that I began appreciating this series- it grows on you.",1194652800,3,688,4.939655172413793
2613982,5,B000GIW95K,Inspector Frost is always intertaining. I have all 12 seasons of these mysteries and this is my favorite. The inspector is always in trouble with the top brass but he always comes out on top with his great detective work even if he hates the paper work that goes along with the job. I highly recommend this dvd to any one who loves a good mystery.,1181347200,5,347,4.2727272727272725
