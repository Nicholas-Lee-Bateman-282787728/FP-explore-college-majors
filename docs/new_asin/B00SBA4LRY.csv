6968286,5,B00SBA4LRY,Spiral just keeps getting better. The best cop show either side of the Atlantic since The WIre. If you have not watched  any of the series you are in for a real treat.,1449619200,2,167,4.0606060606060606
6968287,5,B00SBA4LRY,"Spiral is a French series that connects the police, the judicial system and the private lives of them all. This is the fifth series, and we have just come off a shocking death of one of the beloved in the police unit. Police Chief Laure Berthaud played by Caroline Proust was the lover of the man killed. She is an intelligent, tough policewoman.  Her police team is her family in all ways. She has just found out a personal issue she has to deal with. Her protector and first mate is Gilou played by Thierry Godard. He is an ex-druggie, woman's man, but a good cop. Tintin, played by Fred Bianconi, usually the stable family man, now does not want to go home. Is it grief from the loss of his mate? And, the head of the group, the much disliked but tolerated, Commissioner Herville, played by Nicholas Briancon.

On the legal front we have handsome Lawyer Pierre Clement, up and coming he is going for bar council. The white haired Judge Francois Roban, played by Philippe Duclos, usually on the right side of the law. And, the , the beautiful redhead Lawyer Josephine Karlsson, played by Audrey Fleurot.

This season the team is concentrating on the deaths of a mother and daughter. In the mix comes a policeman's death, and we are looking for the killer. Is he the man in custody it was he set up? Two big cases and the minutiae that clogs the system. Each character has new traits that are positive, but are they here to stay? Exciting series.

6968293,5,B00SBA4LRY,"We've watched the first four season of Spiral on Netflix and loved every minute.  Since season isn't available on Netflix but available on region 2 DVD from Amazon, we went ahead and purchased a region-free DVD player and the Spiral season 5 DVD set and enjoyed season 5 as much if not more than seasons 1-4.  We have since used the DVD player to watch Forbrydelsen (just starting season 2 -- another superb series) and all of Borgen.  Watching these wonderful Nordic and Euro-Noir series on DVD is well worth the expense, and I would highly recommend that fans in the US invest in a region-free player and DVDs to access some of the best entertainment available.",1479427200,5,663,4.64957264957265

6968295,5,B00SBA4LRY,"Incredibly addictive TV series.  It's all in French, with English subtitles, but at a pace that allows you time to read and still watch the action.  Probably the most graphically and true-to-life depiction of police and judicial procedure ever, with terrific characters (phenomenal acting) and intriguing story lines.  Can't wait for the next season!!",1477440000,,351,5.462962962962963

6968298,4,B00SBA4LRY,"Compared to earlier seasons, crime and detection could not contend with judicial cruelty, tragedy, and loss.  Despite the drama for the beginning of next season depending on personal matters, I am still riveted.",1473292800,,211,5.393939393939394

6968304,5,B00SBA4LRY,Love the show. Watching the 5th Season now. One feels that the main characters are real. I've watched II on Netflix and DVD's as well as on the French Channel.

Refreshing compared to what we are accustomed to in the States/TV...more interesting, intriguing, nail biting, shocking..real to life series. All the characters were superb! Enjoy international films and TV!! So sad when Pierre Clement was killed off...Josephine will continue on as that is her nature..personality.....Judge Roban is toning down a bit...Capt. Berthaud character is going in all directions....like to see the romantic side of her character in addition to Bremont....Love this series!",1462838400,,573,5.833333333333333
6968308,5,B00SBA4LRY,Spiral is my favorite show of all time. It is non stop action with credible characters and complex plots.,1461974400,,105,4.578947368421052

6968310,5,B00SBA4LRY,"Wow.  I hope that something this good will some day be made in America.  But then again, Fargo, which is different is awfully good too.  This is gritty and realistic and just plain good.  I'm not sure which actor or actress I like best as they are all so good.",1460332800,,260,4.14
6968311,3,B00SBA4LRY,"I have really enjoyed all the previous Spiral series.  The actors are brilliant.  Great plots.  Nothing formulaic or predictable. It has been the best thing on TV since it started.  Even the ""Bad Guys"" are so brilliantly cast.  All the characters have been realistic and dynamic.  Series 1-4 have been jaw-droppingly good.  But, this series....... I can't agree with the other reviews.  I thought this one was written and produced with everyone involved being just a bit bored with having to do another series.  I first bought this without subtitles, and thought maybe I didn't enjoy it so much because my French was not up to scratch.  However, watching it again with subtitles was no better.  Caroline Proust's character of Laure - I find Caroline Proust to be a fabulous actress and Laure has always been realistic, and a brilliant character - this time around I found the character irritating and ridiculous.  Laure's actions, which brings series 5 to an end, were ...... well, I felt as though the ending was written during a very rushed lunch break.  There are a few big moments, but even they were not really as believable as Spiral usually is. Spiral has always done Bad Guys brilliantly.  Mr Aziz & the Larbi brothers (Series 2??).  Fabulous!!!  The Bad Guys (Girls, in this series) were of no interest. The main Bad Girl actress was great - will no doubt see her in something worthy of her acting in the near future - but I felt the character was just a hoodie-clad twit (as seen in any run down mall or fringe suburb tube station), rather than someone to be feared.  Audrey Fleurot's character of M.Karlsson remains as fabulous as ever. The series is worth watching for her alone.  It is also good viewing to brush up on French, and Verlan.  Not as good as it has been, but still the best thing on TV.",1459036800,4,1812,4.623824451410658

6968320,5,B00SBA4LRY,"We got hooked on Spiral on Netflix but couldn't wait for Season 5 to get to the US.  IMO once you get hooked on a series like Engrenages you will never be satisfied again with the mindless junk on the US networks.  The characters are ""real"" people each of whom has his or her flaws.  And the judicial system is far from perfect but it's the reality you have to live with.

Buying Region 2 DVDs works fine as long as you rip them to a hard drive that you can use as a media server.",1454112000,5,480,3.96875
6968321,5,B00SBA4LRY,Year after year..the best..excellent,1452470400,2,36,8.25
6968322,5,B00SBA4LRY,"Season 5 had some real shockers to it but that is why people want to watch fast paced police thrillers. As usual, the police, the judges and the lawyers are completely mixed up with one another in every single case that comes in the building. This is very different from the U.S. where these groups do not intermingle in their jobs to this degree. The judges especially in the US have almost nothing to do with the police yet in France they are on a first name daily basis talking about their cases and working on them. It is very bewildering but it seems to work for them.

In this season there are several plot lines as usual. The most compelling one is a vicious girl gang which has moved far beyond lower level crime into just about any kind of crime. In just an instant they will be viciously attacking someone with little to no provocation. Most of them have been in foster care and in prison. What makes them come to notice is that they knew a mother and child whose bodies were found wrapped together in the canal.

Things are a bit more subtle but no less vicious when we move to the lawyer-judge side of the equation. Roban is, as usual, investigation his cases like mad but also making as many enemies as usual. He is an expert at causing personal misery without even thinking about it. The red headed female lawyer is still by far the most competent lawyer in the building and my guess is that she's also the most competent person in the building. She has some very high drama occur in her life and goes through a great deal of trauma.

The cops are our usual gang but there are some changes in status which shakes things up. This is a big plot point though so I can't say anymore.

In sum, this continues to be first rate television.",1452038400,4,1746,4.330275229357798
