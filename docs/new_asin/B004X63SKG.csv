4492262,5,B004X63SKG,"It was a good old time western with a surpirse ending. Like all old westerns , no language and good story line. I would recommend this movie to any John Smith fan, as he did a good job of acting in it,",1391558400,,201,3.8095238095238093
4492263,3,B004X63SKG,"I actually bought this movie because it was filmed in Kanab, Utah. (They hold Western Legends Roundup every August to celebrate their film history as over 200 movies & TV shows - primarily westerns - were filmed in & around Kanab.) It's an okay western - it would have been considered a ""B"" western back in the day. But it was fun to watch since it was filmed in Kanab, & you can still see the areas where it was filmed.",1388275200,,420,4.197530864197531
4492264,4,B004X63SKG,"Where do I start...I suppose I am lucky to have actually got the right film! and that's a good place to start!. This is another of those very obscure westerns that I have wanted to see for 50 years or more. Idon't think it's ever been on TV here in the U?K and never will be, and I doubt it will receive a ""U/K"" release. So, along with 5 other DVD's all at the same price,($20) I ordered it from the ""made to order"" MGM/Fox group on Amazon USA. It turned up earlier than forecast (they all did), and I am pleased to say that the quality (as they all have been) is excellent. So no grumbles there at all. The film is really for mad western buffs like me (and Dr Nagi and ""Mr Jim"" Lovins - sorry guys), and for me it is a good view. Kent Taylor is always value for money, and John Smith does well as the hero in one of his early roles pre ""Laramie"". Support cast is good - Marian Carr makes a useful Claire Trevor type, and Serena Sand is a different kind of Indian Maid. John Doucette disapears far to early, and a rather forgotten ""heavy"" Joel Asley does well. Also on show for real buffs are Boyd ""Red"" Morgan and Al Wyatt as driver and guard respectively. It's a kind of ""Stagecoach"" plot tho not as good and full of cliches, but to me, it's none the worse for that, and I enjoyed it. Recomended for hard core western fans. (For more plot details do read Dr Nafi's review)",1327968000,3,1374,4.111524163568773
4492265,4,B004X63SKG,"This movie was first released in 1956(2011), in full screen 1.33.1, B/W and runs 75 minutes. The sound and picture quality are very good. There are no extras. The film starts with a Missouri Western stage coach stopping in the wild west because the lead horse has a shoe problem. They were next to FLINT river. The coach was heading for RIMROCK. After 90 miles ride Duff Dailey(JOHN SMITH) and Trusty McCabe arrive at Rimrock and find it looted, deserted and rundown. They think the Cheyenne and Arapaho could have done this. Then they see the stage coming. Barbara Leyton(MARIAN CARR) was to meet Duff here. They had to move to the next station of 'CHIMNEY BUIT'. Everybody gets back into the coach and they ride again, Duff and his friend Trusty scouting ahead. Conroy(KENT TAYLOR) and Doc(JOHN DONCETTE) agree that Indians had been there. The preacher thinks, Indians must have been seriously provoked or drunk. The scouts soon find empty alcohol bottles. 2 more join in, Kindare and his son Alex(GARY MURRAY). They say Chimney Buit was knocked out that morning. They all decide to go North to avoid the Indians. But suddenly the coach driver is arrowed in his back. More Indians mass on the nearby hill and then they are behind the coach, chasing. Soon the Indians stop chasing and the stage coach sees a town ahead, all deserted. The horses were tired and they needed to use the best building, Pipestore saloon. The Doc was missing. They do not understand why the Indians let them slip into this town, without a fight. Duff thinks, there was tabou on this town with white crosses on the house doors, possibly the town was wiped out by the 'fever'. And they had only 130 rounds of cartridges left.
How will it end? Why did the Indians stay away from the town? What did the white crosses on the doors of the houses mean? What was in those houses? What happened to the missing Doc? Will Cheyenne attack? Who sold rifles to the Indians? Can they get any help in? What do the Indians want?
This story of JAMESON BREWER is beautifully photographed in B/W by JOSEPH F BIROC and well directed by ALLEN MINER. The action scenes are very good, however the film starts briskly and slows at the end. The film was made in Kanab, Utah. JOHN SMITH(ROBERT ERROL VAN ORDEN -3.3.1931 to 25.1.1995) gives a good performance.
KENT TAYLOR(LOUIS WILLIAM WEISS) was born on 11.5.1907 in Nashua, Iowa. He appeared in more than 110 films, the bulk of them 'B' Movies in 1930's and 1940's. In 1950, his movie career was on the decline and the TV production was on the uprising. He played 58 episodes in detective series 'Boston Blackie' and 39 episodes of 'Rough Riders'. The last years of his career were spent in slaughter and horror films. He was married to KULEK AUGUSTA(1930-1987) and had 3 children. He retired in 1974. He died on 11.4.1987, aged 79, in Woodland Hills, California.
Some of Kent Taylor's films are:-
(1) I Am No Angel, 1933

4492266,1,B004X63SKG,"The movie I recieved was in a dvd case that said Ghost Town as was the Dvd itself, however the disc contained the movie "" A Crime against Joe"". I sent it back to amazon and they shipped another But again it was the same error. I understand it is a Mfg error, but after the first time it would have been nice for them to check the actual dvd. I now have another DVD to return, and although they will credit my account after its returned its still a burden i don't want. As of today they never sent the right movie or offered an explaination. as of now i guess theres no "" Ghost Town"" In My Future. Good Luck If You Order This Product.",1307664000,4,633,3.9921259842519685

4492269,4,B004X63SKG,"With his sleek sandy-blond hair, erect broad-shouldered build, easy grace of movement, and beaming smile, John Smith seemed poised for a successful career in the early 60s, especially after a year as second lead in ""Cimarron City"" and four years as Slim Sherman on ""Laramie.""  Unfortunately he fell afoul of a powerful director and was more or less blackballed for the rest of his life--but not before he made a couple of good mid-range Westerns, one of which is this, in which he's effectively the lead even though Kent Taylor has first billing.  He plays Duff Dailey, a former Boston newspaperman who went West to hunt for gold two years ago, partnered with old-timer Crusty McCabe (William Phillips), took to the country, and now, having accumulated enough dust to buy a newspaper of his own in California, has sent for his fiancee, Barbara Leighton (Marian Carr), to join him at Rimrock Station so they can go on together.  But when he and Crusty reach the station, they find it's been attacked by a mixed party of Cheyenne and Arapaho; the staff is dead and the horses gone.  Just then the stage arrives, carrying not only Barbara but hard-drinking Doc Clawson (John Doucette), possible gambler Anse Conroy (Taylor), and the Rev. Wheedle (Gilman Rankin), who's certain that Indians are ""not savages"" and that if approached ""with love and understanding"" they'll respond with friendship.  Shortly the group is joined by Sgt. Ben Dockery (Joel Ashley) and his son Alex (Gary Murray), on their way East for a visit, who reveal that the next station on has also been wiped out and there are a thousand hostiles between the travellers and the fort.  Duff suggests that north is their only option, the stage driver agrees, and then a war party gallops into view and the decision is taken out of their hands.  In the ensuing chase they lose the driver and guard and Clawson before finding their way to a small ghost town, where they decide to fort up at least until the stage horses can rest.  With little food and less ammunition, their chances are slim, but Duff hasn't spent two years prospecting and dreaming of Barbara to give up easily.  Then he discovers a fugitive Cheyenne chief (Chief Ted Nez) and his half-Irish granddaughter (Serena Sande) in the barn, and thereafter revelations come thick and fast as Dockery, Conroy, and Barbara all show their true colors.

The story is apparently set sometime between 1864-6, since Duff mentions ""two of the best"" journalists, Bret Harte and Mark Twain, as currently working in California.  The movie's low-budget, and of course the guns are all wrong for the time, but it's a very character-driven story with both humor and suspense.",1438300800,,2681,4.857456140350878

8446230,3,B004X63SKG,"John Smith was a good actor but he and his partner played by Gilman Rankin are wasted in this poor man's version of STAGECOACH which has variations of most of the expected characters.  There is the hard drinking doctor who just disappears early in the movie.  Did John Doucette have an argument with the director?  The sleek character played by Kent Taylor, whom you would peg as the professional gambler turns out to be something really sleazy instead.  The true-hearted blonde fiance also turns out to be something less than she seems.  Of course the half Indian girl is noble and admirable.  Then there is the stupid, touchy-feely guy who thinks that we would all just get along if we talked to each other (This stock character is played by Ward Bond in DAKOTA INCIDENT, a better STAGECOACH knockoff).  Of course there is an army sergeant who obviously has a secret and a son who wants to prove himself.  And there is the hoard of dangerous Indians, said to be 1000 strong but appearing to be no more than 30 or so.  There is also a coffin found in the ghost town with what at first glance appears to be a wooden stake driven into it with dried blood around it.  Unfortunately this is actually a candle with melted wax around it.  I say unfortunately because a vampire or even just a mystery would have added some interest to the movie.  If you would like to see a B movie version of STAGECOACH with the supernatural spicing it up, try BLOOD MOON, a 2014 movie about which I wrote a review a couple of hours ago.",1448841600,,1515,4.449275362318841
