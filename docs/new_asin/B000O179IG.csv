2789100,5,B000O179IG,"Pinky and the Brain are undoubtedly the two most delightful cartoon characters who ever nearly took over the world. The witty tongue in cheek writing always had warmth and genuine sweetness, which the talents of Maurice LaMarche and Rob Paulsen brought beautifully to life. Speaking of which, who the heck are Corey Burton, Richard Libertini, Joe Lala and John Vernon - listed as the actors? I can't find any of them in the IMDB database and, if they ever were in this series at all, they don't seem to merit being in the credits. Why aren't the names of the two stars of the series listed here? Is this the work of Snowball?",1217289600,,625,4.539823008849558
2789101,5,B000O179IG,"C'mon, its Pinky and the Brain.  I ponder how 2 take over world too!  HA!  Great fun.  Steven Spielberg's mind?  Whew!",1214697600,,118,4.428571428571429
2789102,4,B000O179IG,"It's their last hurrah in the third and final volume of Steven Speilberg's award-winning series as Pinky and the Brain continue their global conquest which will keep you laughing at each failure.  (Even more of their attempts are shown in ""Animaniacs, Vol. 3"" also available.)

These 22 episodes on four discs include ""But That's Not All Folks"", ""Broadway Malady"", ""Dangerous Brains"", the three-part special ""Brainwashed"", and the Animaniacs themed ""Star Warners"".

This set also has a special feature called ""It's All About the Fans"" where the voices of the title rodent characters (Rob Paulsen and Maurice LaMarche) pay tribute to us fellow viewers.

Now that this is the last volume of this series, I wonder what will take its place when ""Animaniacs, Volume Four"" is out ?  I hope it's ""Tiny Toons Adventures"".  That would really be something to own on DVD.  I'd really like to catch up on the crazy mis-adventures of Buster Bunny, Babs Bunny, Plucky Duck, and a whole lotta other Looney Tunes inspired characters.  Yeah, I really hope that's in development.

Oh, wait.  There's also ""Pinky, Elmyra, and the Brain"".  The adventures of those little mice with big plans still continue, but under a new roof.  The roof of the animal-loving Elmyra, who is another character from ""Tiny Toons"".  I probably think that will be on DVD next.  Either way, I really want to see some more classic Kids WB series on DVD for the first time.  I don't mind waiting, that's for sure.",1187913600,14,1469,4.866935483870968
2789103,5,B000O179IG,"I have read the other reviews, that think this set represents the decline and fall of the once-great Pinky and The Brain show. Why do I disagree? Some of my all-time favorite episodes are here! They represent the show hitting its peak artistically. Just LOOK at the richness of these episodes:

-You Said A Mouseful! (the Hackensack Socko Kicky Sack Sack Kicker factory! Peggy Babcock!)
-Broadawy Malady (""someone who misses Norman Brain"" -- now THAT is a pun that will go down in history, plus of course the song ""It Must Be April""!)
-Brainie The Poo (with narration by John Rhys-Davies, yes GIMLI)
-The Melancholy Brain (their answer to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead)",1187136000,,677,4.93859649122807
2789104,2,B000O179IG,"The plans to take over the world are no longer Rube Goldberg-esque concoctions pursued with zeal.  In several classic episodes, these plans were brilliant parodies of the concoctions in movies.  In this collection, the ""best"" are but pale, dumbed down imitations of their inspirations.  Then there are a few that are minor retreads.

But most episodes use the P&B ""plan"" simply as a skeleton on which to hang a collection of immediate cultural and celebrity references.  I found these episodes to be flat and joyless.  Many of the references were short-lived and, although I recognized them, my reaction these many years later is ""So what.""  The references that could have had some legs didn't have a hook to keep them fresh - they came across as old standard jokes.

Nothing illustrates this better than the contrast provided by the standout episode ""Just say Narf"". It took classic material (Donald O'Connor's ""Make 'Em Laugh"" from ""Singing in the Rain"") and put a decided P&B spin on it.

The most telling aspect of this volume is that several of the episodes have P&B as Hollywood actors, mirroring the large shift in perspective of the creative team.  In early P&B, the perspective was of rebels and outsiders delighting in ridiculing the ridiculous in Hollywood.  In this volume, they have devolved into Hollywood insiders who can only muster smirks.

If you are already a P&B fan, the memories and residual good will will probably make this volume moderately entertaining.  But if you are new to P&B, you will likely be perplexed about what all the buzz was about.",1183507200,11,1571,4.90530303030303
2789105,5,B000O179IG,"pinky and the brain has to be my favorite cartoon of all time. from bizzare plans to take over the world to even more bizarre plans to make those bizzare plans work, pinky and the brains shenanigans never get old. i grew up watching pinky and the brain, and they never get old. Strange and interesting characters, ranging from brains nemesis snowball, to pinky's horse/girlfriend, as well as the occasional anamaniac apperances,  round out the outrageous cast of the show. The joy that they seem to take in slamming bill clinton and other famous figure (although mostly clinton), is just so infectious that you cant help but laugh. And even better are the deep themes that appear if you watch closely enough, but don't affect the hilarity of the show if you don't notice them, makes the show fun to watch for everyone. i even wrote a paper on one of the episodes for my compostion class. there will never be another cartoon of pinky and the brains caliber. this show is the perfect thing to enjoy with your children and friends. it may take some convincing to get them to watch, but once they do they will be hooked.

A Pinky and the Brain fan For life!",1181433600,12,1153,4.538461538461538
2789106,5,B000O179IG,"By the time this show reached its third season, the joke was getting a little thinly spread. The plots became further away from the initial concept of two lab mice wanting to take over the world and more a showcase for the two lead characters' interaction. This however is not a criticism.

In TV the word 'formula' is dreaded. However, here the characters remain so endearing that the blueprint of every plot being vitually the same did not matter.

Most episodes followed this arc: -

1. Brain has a bizarre idea as to how to take over the world

2. To carry out this plan some equipment/money is needed

3. Brain comes up with an even more bizarre way to get said equipment/money

4. The plan fails due to Pinky's stupidity

5. The initial plan to take over the world is abandoned

6. Start over tomorrow night

Although there are exceptions, that basically sums up this and the previous two seasons but as the saying goes - If ain't broke don't fix it - and this formula was one that bore a lot of comedy fruit.

This show certainly beats some of the dross that graces our screens these days and had the nerve to demand that its audience had some intelligence.

Not laugh-a-minute but still a classic.

Ps .

I still can't believe that no-one has decided to revive these characters to star in a live-action movie (with CGI P&B of course).",1180483200,20,1342,4.473251028806584

 Great cartoon series co produced by the superb Steven Spielberg. this series is about a lab mouse that is bent on world domination and the other lab mouse pinky who ends up screwing the plans of his beloved friend brain. cheese,world domination, politics,and a witty sense of humour is the name of the game in this great cartoon series. if you like political satire, comedy, with two lab mice then this is the cartoon for you.

  thumbs up to steven spielberg and the rest of the crew that were involved in this outlandish series of world events according to mice.

This amazing work will never be matched due to how people view television today and how people restrict and edit things to make them politically correct.  Even in season 3, pinky says the term politically correct in the form of an acronym ""pc term"". The ability the animators had is unmatched today because of how the animators were given complete autonomy.  Given free reign they could do whatever they wanted for their show.  This kind of freedom is no more and now shows are heavily monitored to ensure their content is what the studio wants.
This show is entertaining for the children due to its slapstick comedy and to adults through its satire and spoofs. It is one of the few shows that I still watch from my childhood.
If they were to continue thus show, it would be a blessing to the television world, today's programming is mindless and asinine. I hope that someday intellectuals can view this and compare it to modern shows and figure out what happened to society's taste on television.",1416787200,,1169,4.705882352941177

2789264,5,B000O179IG,"Are you pondering what I'm pondering? I hope so, as I am pondering why this show didn't go for ten years or more.

Our best lab rat 'Brain' pours his blood, sweat and tears into plans in his attempt to take over the world. In the process he becomes, among other things, a waiter, a teacher, a sumo wrestler, a baseball player and evens tries to take a day off from all that pondering, but even that does not go to plan.

As with this third and last dose of pure maniac enthusiasm Brain has to endure his one and only friend Pinky - the dimwit, but it is a partnership that survives many trying times. Brain came up with some weird ideas that had me pondering how two lab rats could get the funds for their plans to come to fruition, or how the world would go being ruled by two rats, scary isn't it?

This is the end of the road, the last swan song, the last train to Clarksville, the last chance to experience the octaine high of two megalomaniacs, one as genius as the other is insane.

To cap off the series Rob Paulsen (Pinky) and Maurice LaMarche (Brain) play their swan song in a tribute for the dedicated fans, which left a gaping void so huge.

This four disc set gets five stars from me, as one needs to let go and enjoy the maniac side of things once in a while. For those who wish to obtain the series I suggest you go ahead. You should not be disappointed, as long as you do not wish to take over the world, that is.",1380844800,4,1428,4.103942652329749

2789293,4,B000O179IG,"Warner Bros. is an amazing outfit. Almost dying in the sixties, with De Patie-Freleng doing their animation work, and putting out some of the most formulaic swill imaginable in detective shows and westerns for TV, (except for ""F-Troop"", a sitcom staged like one of their old cartoons done live,) and after having the foresight to sign up Stanley Kubrick as their in-house cinematic ""artiste"" in the 70s, revived their animation department in the early nineties, and, while not as fluid and great as their golden stuff from the forties and early fifties, the writing was ingenious as h-e-double hockey-sticks, and this duo's antics were a prime example. Along with Slappy Squirrel, ""Pinky and the Brain"" was definitely one of the cleverest cartoon series ever written, as episodes like ""Broadway Malady"" bear witness. This is an episode with songs like ""The Schoeden-Freude Polka"", ""I'm Going To Have To Hurt You"" and ""Angst!""...stuff so far over unit-aged kids' heads, it's incredible! Yes, the animation could be MUCH better, but when you're doing two or three animated series  at once, I guess some compromises have to be made. I dunno... Disney didn't do TOO badly with their TV animation, and they were turning them out like fishcakes for a while there, too!

Anyway, buy or rent this collection, (I may buy all three eventually,) and I can assure you, you won't feel like a stupid jerk watching a kiddie cartoon! If anything, you'll need a thesaurus!!
