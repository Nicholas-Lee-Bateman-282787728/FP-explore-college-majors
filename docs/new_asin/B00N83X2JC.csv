6612985,5,B00N83X2JC,"Finally, the official release from Warner Archive is here!  Excellent quality and transfer for each episode.

Thankfully, the initial teaser for each episode is included: ""Tonight...on Spenser For Hire.""  For some reason, it was important to have that.

In terms of extras and DVD menu, very bare bones.  No extra content, no chapter search features.  Very simple, play all or select an episode menu on each disc.

The pilot is included and unedited.

I probably should take a star off for that, but it is my first Warner Archive purchase (not sure if that is common among MOD (made-on-demand) discs).  Although, the website indicated that the first runs of this release would be pressed (normal production method) and not MOD.  I'm also simply thrilled as a fan to have the set, so the star remains to reward Warner Archive; hopefully, the next two seasons will follow shortly.",1410134400,58,878,4.91156462585034
6612986,5,B00N83X2JC,"One of the best detective series of its time and the characters still hold up today.  The characters are pretty faithful to Robert B. Parker's book series.  I will definitely be adding seasons 2 and 3.  My only negative would be that there are no extras, such as director or actor commentaries, but that fact doesn't effect the actual show.",1500508800,,340,4.633333333333334

6612988,5,B00N83X2JC,"I remember when this series 1st hit the television. Here was a detective who could go from quoting Faulkner to poetry to the Bible as needed and was a gourmet cook to boot.  He was a tough guy who had a heart of gold and a sense of justice that served to maintain his moral character.  He occasionally traversed the mean streets of Boston with a comrade-in-arms, if you will, Hawk.  Although on the opposite side of the tracks in their 'careers', they held a mutual respect for each other that allowed them to overlook some of their differences.  I found this DVD set to be of good quality and sound, really bringing the TV series back to life for me.  You can set this to play the entire DVD at one sitting or you can play each episode one at a time at your leisure.  All-in-all, if you liked Spenser, then it is worth buying this DVD set.  I'm enjoying this very much; when everything didn't have to be about blood and guts, but a good story, intelligent sleuthing, and fun all around, with a good cry or shout on occasion.",1498176000,,1025,4.307291666666667
6612989,3,B00N83X2JC,"Spenser For Hire; The Complete First Season stars Robert Urich as Robert B. Parkers creation a  Boston private eye who defies the mold of most TV detectives. Spenser is well-read, a gourmet cook, ex-boxer, and former Boston policeman. Operating out of a converted firehouse, he drives around town in a vintage Mustang solving crimes and protecting those who want a touch of class with their private detecting.

His chief street contact and occasional back-up is Hawk (Avery Brooks), a tall, menacing, yet intelligent black man who operates on both sides of the law. Lt. Quirk (Richard Jaeckel) is Spensers buddy in the Boston Police Department, and Sgt. Frank Belson (Ron McLarty) is Quirks subordinate, always ready with a wisecrack.

In the first season, Spenser is hired to find the runaway wife of a wealthy businessman, the police department engages him to protect a witness who might not be who she claims, thrill killers target Spenser, an investigation of the apparent suicide of a young nun leads to a corrupt landlord, a valuable relic is stolen from a museum, Lt. Quirk is suspended because of suspected involvement in a gambling ring, Spenser investigates the disappearance of a Mexican labor organizer, Sgt. Belson falls in love with a white supremacist, and a rape victim is kidnapped by an ex-con determined to kill Spenser.

Urich balances Spensers Renaissance-man aura with his tough as nails manner of dealing with bad guys. Making the lead character literate and well-educated is an interesting touch, setting him apart from other TV private eyes. First season guest stars include William H. Macy, Patricia Clarkson, Chuck Connors, Shirley Knight, George Grizzard, Alfred Drake, Lonette McKee, Dick Latessa, Richard Jenkins, Frances McDormand, Jimmy Smits, Brad Dourif, and Linda Thorson.

All 22 episodes of the 1985-1986 season are contained in a 6-disc DVD set. The unrated episodes are presented in the full-frame format. There are no bonus materials.",1497312000,,1974,5.214511041009464

Now I have them all and they're as good as I remember. Were you a fan? If so, you will not be disappointed. The best cast possible and while not specifically true to the book character(Robert B. Parker was not impressed at first) its still one of the best PI/Cop series TV has ever produced. I Loved it then and time hasn't changed that. Again, were you a fan? If you still are, jump in.

I'm glad I didn't buy it. The action is fine, but the plots are weak. Spencer seems to be in the habit of solving crimes without a logical plot twist to explain how he did it. Parker wasn't happy with this series and I can understand why.  Another problem is that Hawk kills somebody every episode, sometimes without rhyme nor reason.",1477267200,,493,4.3478260869565215

I saw the movies with joe mategna. He did not fit the role. Also, the person who portrayed  Hawk wad all wrong. I was lucky enough to meet Mr. Parker several times.

6613018,5,B00N83X2JC,"When I first heard that Robert Urich was cast to play another P.I. in yet another television series I began to have mixed feelings.  Don't get me wrong, I loved ""Vegas"" and I was excited and couldn't wait to see what ""Spenser: For Hire"" was going to be like, but at the same time I also felt like
""been there, done that!"".  This new series I felt was just going to have to show me that it was worthy of my viewership.  It didn't take long!  I fell in love with the show after just a few episodes.  Mostly because of the cast and the chemistry they soon developed, and the locations around Boston that I recognized.  Robert Urich and Avery Brooks were born to play opposite each other as were Urich and Barbara Stock.  As Spenser and Hawk -- and Spenser and Susan, along with Sgt, Belson and Lt. Quirk, after a few episodes, I knew I was going to like this show.  I loved how they used locations around the Boston area, and was amused when they (for example) were supposed to be in Boston's North End yet they actually were filming in Central Square in Lynn.  Most wouldn't know that unless they were from the area.  Central Square and it's surroundings look a lot like the North End, and it was probably logistically better because of traffic and also because some streets in old Boston are very tiny.  No particular episode stands out as my favorite during the first season, but I love all of them.  ""No room at the inn"", Discord in a minor (a dark episode about a troubled musical child prodigy and her equally talented father who without a doubt was ten times as troubled.  ""DISCORD in 'A' MINOR"" as in the musical note ""A-minor"" -- I got it!  ""The killer with"" is an intriguing psychological thriller intertwined with international spies.  Spenser and Susan surreptitiously dropped a reference to Urich's first series (from 1969?) ""Bob & Carol, Ted & Alice"" a rather peculiar sitcom featuring a pair of ""swingers"" which I remember more for the title.  ""At the river's edge"" co-starred a friend of Urich's, John Davidson (who also guest starred an an episode of ""Vegas""), ""Resurrection"", and  ""A day's wages"" just to name several.  Spenser (with and 'S' instead of a 'C'): For Hire's first season was very loyal to the literary series, which featured several of Spenser's infamous underworld adversaries such as KING POWERS (played by the Rifleman's Chuck Conners) in the pilot and the episode ""Children of a tempest storm""; JOE BROZ (Ray Serra), and TOM FLAHERTY (David O'Brien).  The series also co-starred some memorable actors such as  Samuel L. Jackson, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Laura San Giacomo, Debra Jo Rupp, David Hyde Pierce, Kadeem Hardison, Paul Guilfoyle, Cleavant Derricks, Trini Alvarado, Marg Helgenberger, Steve Inwood, Spalding Gray, Nancy Marchand, Gerry Cooney, Dan Lauria, Jay Thomas, D.B. Sweeny, Ving Rhames, Rob Morrow, Gail Strickland, Josh Mostel, Lauren Holly, George Grizzard, Jimmy Smits, Ron Parady, Eriq La Salle, Seth Green, Angela Bassett, E.G. Marshall, Tony Shalhoub, Patricia Richardson, John C. McGinley, Andie MacDowell, Laurence Fishburne, Nancy Travis, John Spencer, John Pankow, Stephen McHattie, Brad Dourif, Jay O. Sanders, Paul Dooley, Patricia Clarkson, Andrea Thompson, Boyd Gaines, Geoffrey Lewis, Kate Burton, Shirley Knight, Earl Hindman, William H. Macy, Tom Urich, Heather Menzies-Urich, and Bobby Orr, and list goes on...  Spenser: For Hire is one of the all-time greats.  I wish they would bring it back because it was way too short, and I always felt there were tons more episodes to be made and seen.  I also just found out  Robert B. Parker was in negotiations to return  the series to TNT in 2010 with a whole new cast -- and then he died and it looks like any plans for a re-boot as they say is on hold for now.

Robert Urich's portrayal of Robert B Parker's Spenser wasn't exactly what the creator wanted, but for the viewers it was epic! Urich and Avery Brooks' 'Hawk' had magnificent chemistry, and the beautiful Barbara Stock as Susan Silverman, fit the role perfectly. The Firehouse, the Bullitt Green '66 Mustang, the 'confident, clarified' attitude shown made the series a pleasure for 1985 viewers who had never even read any of  Parkers' novels.

Boib Urich left us much too soon, but viewers can see the great man's work in this crisply-produced set. Hope Warners' does the third season as well!",1442275200,2,616,5.079207920792079

6613080,5,B00N83X2JC,"This was one of my all-time favorites when it came out years ago, and my niece and I would watch them on TV together.  It's the typical private investigator type of story, played exceptionally well by Robert Urich and Avery Brooks.  Two manly good guys who could be bad guys when they needed to be, always sensitive to the underdog and believing in fair play.  Full of rough and tumble action by two unlikely partners, with a touch of philosophy and sometimes a little poetry thrown in.

Unfortunately, due to the high costs of filming in Boston, they only produced three seasons -- two of which are finally out on DVD after all this time.  I'm hoping they complete the series at some point by releasing season three.  Thoroughly enjoyable.",1439683200,,740,4.653846153846154
6613081,5,B00N83X2JC,"Thank goodness!!! I (and probably millions of other Spenser fans) have been waiting for years for this release. As I read some of the other reviews, I realized just how popular the TV series had been. We all know that the book version has been a continuing phenomenon, but I am just seeing some of the enthusiasm that still lingers for the Urich -Brooks iteration of the Boston gumshoe. As others have noted, it is a shame that we didn't get a full featured, ""pressed"" version with more sophisticated menus options, but heck, I'm tickled to get any thing after this long wait. A few years ago one of the online streaming services had the series available, not HuLu, but something along those lines. I started to watch with season one, episode one, and was really getting into it when they dropped it. What a bummer. Anyway, I have been routinely searching for it since, and ordered season one just to see how they did with this mak to order format. Had never had one before. Looks ok, and have watched a few episodes, and they are all I could hope for. Video is sharp and sound quality is good, but even with the volume turned up, it is a little hard to hear.

Shows were funny, suspenseful, dramatic, heart breaking and ground breaking. Characters became icons, household names. I can't believe how long it's taking to get some of my favorites from back then to be released. First Scarecrow and Mrs. King, now Spenser, next stop the complete series of Knots Landing.

6613109,1,B00N83X2JC,"I moved to Boston in 1986 so this series had some nostalgic appeal for me.  After 30 years, I would say that there is some excellent Boston location filming but sadly, the series is insanely violent.  Spenser, the compassionate lover of poetry, spends most of his time shooting bad guys.  In broad daylight with people all around, including the police, Spenser is shooting, shooting, shooting.  In almost every episode, the body count is worthy of a Scorsese film.  The last episode I watched opened with a dude with an automatic weapon gunning down park rangers on the Esplanade.  God bless America!  And if that's not bad enough, in his free time Spenser and his girlfriend annoy us with lots of irritating dialogue while tough guy assassin Hawk just keeps smiling.

6613111,5,B00N83X2JC,"Excellent series. Robert Urich does not really try very hard to have the personality of the character in the book, though he does look a little ""tough"" at times, and sometimes is made up to look a little"" ugly"", as the character in the books describes himself.  But for the most part, he is a remake of the character, but loses little in the translation, and after a couple of episodes I was happy with him as the new Spenser. Susan was pretty much as portrayed in the books; Hawk is better than in the books. He is very interesting to observe. I enjoyed the series a lot. One think I did not care for is Spenser calling himself a ""private cop"" - he's not, he's a private detective. And he acts like one, chasing after and shooting transgressors with impunity just like a cop would. This happens often and stretches credulity. But for the most part it is a very enjoyable series.",1434499200,,879,4.392638036809816

6613154,5,B00N83X2JC,"Those of us who have waited for decades to have seasons of Spenser for Hire will most definitely be pleased by what has just been delivered in the form of the first season! The quality of the video is stunning when used with a HDTV. It has also been long enough since I had video tapes (recorded on one of my VCRs) of episodes (and maybe 12 at most) that my memories were themselves fuzzy. This season brings the value of the series back into sharp clarity, and once again reflects on the great source material provided by the amazing Robert B. Parker's wonderful - action and comedy and social commentary - Spenser novels. There could never be a better Spenser than Robert Urich nor a more completely fleshed out Hawk than Avery Brooks. A treat all around.",1429142400,,757,4.492753623188406

6613156,4,B00N83X2JC,"Somehow the show does not seem to be as good as I remember. I do remember I always liked Hawk. When Avery Brooks became the leading actor on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, I remember I kept expecting him to display a .357 Magnum instead of a phaser. Also, I was rather spoiled by Tom Selleck in the Jesse Stone television movies which were really good. Still is an enjoyable series, and Robert Urich and Avery Brooks did excellent characterizations of interesting characters.",1428883200,,472,4.698795180722891

6613158,5,B00N83X2JC,I loved this show and miss it terribly. I am thrilled to see that it is out on DVD. Avery Brooks and Robert Urich made a great detective team.

6613161,5,B00N83X2JC,"Robert Urich stars as Robert B. Parkers legendary Beantown gumshoe-with-a-difference, Spenser. Spenser is cut from a very different cloth than the usual round of TV detectives, a renaissance man who isn't afraid to mix up a gourmet salad or just mix it up. Full-time bookworm and former boxer, the stylish Spenser drives a vintage Mustang that calls out his own sense of time and place - a yearning for a simpler time of ethics and standards, and diplays an appreciation of the best of the past in the present. Keeping Spenser in touch with his complex inner life is his psychologist soulmate, Susan Silverman (Barbara Stock), while the street-savvy Hawk (Avery Brooks) guides Spenser safely through Bostons labyrinthine underworld. Richard Jaeckel costars as Spensers friend on the force, Lt. Quirk. Notable first season guests include William H. Macy, Chuck Connors and Shirley Knight.

That's the best description of a show ever. I love this show and this description comes in a close second on the things i love list.

As such, I didn't gain an earnest love and respect for this show until Lifetime picked it up in syndication and aired the episodes once more.  This is a really great show.  I am ecstatic that the first season is now available on DVD.  I hope all remaining seasons are released as well.  No actor could have played the character of Spenser but Robert Urich.  The role was made for him and he is undeniably superb.  Avery Brooks is awesome as Hawk.  The acting chemistry between Urich and Brooks is magnificent.  The show has mystery, literature, humor, compassion, and friendship.  This is definitely one of the best shows to ever air on television.",1428192000,,722,4.658730158730159

Even Barbara Stock was the best Susan Silverman.  I can go on and on about Marty Quirk and Frank Belson, also irreplacebles.  Spenser and Hawk were a great combo, and it was fantastic to see Robert B. Parkers' books come to life.  I highly recommend ""Spenser For Hire.""",1426464000,2,429,4.448717948717949

6613221,5,B00N83X2JC,"Born and raised in Boston, I lived in Florida when 'Spenser' was running, working a job and raising my kids, which left me very little time for tv shows. My son introduced me to the show, when it was in reruns in the afternoons, when he was home from school eating before leaving for work. He loved Spenser's mustang, and was very upset when it got totaled on one of the episodes, enough that he kept going on and on about it later. Had to find out what he was talking about, so, when I was home one day, I watched - and got hooked.
Season One is a look into my own past - remembering Boston as it was then, seeing the old Boston Garden, the streets, the area.
We moved back here in 1997, live a bit west of Boston, like to go in just to walk around the city, which is a very walkable, historic place, easy to get around.
I started reading the Spenser novels after seeing the show and have been hooked ever since. This show captures Robert Parker's characters to a T. Can't wait for Season Two!",1425168000,5,994,4.155440414507772

6613235,5,B00N83X2JC,"Robert Parker wasn't altogether happy with Robert Urich's portrayal of Spenser. That's too bad. I've read the books and watched the series. I respectfully disagree with Parker; Urich is Spenser. He brings to life the wise-cracking, straight-shooting private cop with a heart. It's too bad that neither of them are still with us, but now their contributions to great storytelling will live on in this classic TV drama.

Avery Brooks plays Hawk with smoldering intensity, part mercenary, part style with substance on his terms. Barbara Stock is Susan Silverman, the woman in Spenser's life. Her character provides the grounding and humanity that sometimes gets lost in the work Spenser does. Although the roles are smaller, the always dependable Richard Jaeckel as by-the-rules Lt. Quirk and the comic relief of Ron McLarty as Stg. Belson add foil to Spenser's irreverent cool.

There are diamonds in the rough here as well. See Patricia Clarkson and William H Macy before they became household names. Clarkson's performance in ""The Choice"" as a natural-born killer, displays her budding talent with menacing clarity.

I hope Warner sees fit to release the other seasons as ""Hawk's Eyes"" is one of the best episodes of the series and occurs in the third season bringing Susan to the crossroads of her deeply held principles. Meanwhile, enjoy Urich's signature role as Spenser. It's intelligent, funny, full of action (thanks to a little car called a Mustang) and deals with issues still not resolved by American culture.

""Spenser: For Hire"" is as much a classic as the car he drives. Enjoy the ride!

If you grew up in the 80's and miss shows like MacGyver, TJ Hooker, Magnum P.I., & Spenser For Hire you better get this dvd before it's all gone and add it to your collection.

6613302,3,B00N83X2JC,"This was made back when American TV was made for active watching. The shows were involved and written for an hour. While most of the episodes are mildly entertaining there is a sublet liberal context to the plots that I of course could do without. There was the abortion show that showed the woman contemplating an abortion based upon wanting to maintain her ""choices"" and ""flexibility"" in life. What nonsense. There were the ""former Catholics"" running around every where . . . revering that cult but sleeping with people out of wedlock, killing people, lying, giving flowers to their women who kill their children, etc. There is also the liberal tactic of showing black Americans as super human in the post-Civil Rights era as a way of gaining acceptance for them. ""Hawk"" is a stone faced, supernaturally endowed with strength, black man that runs around talking in a slow deliberate monotone like a robot. It is just funny. I loved the one episode where ""Spence"" tries to shame ""Hawk"" by saying ""Don't you care that you are evicting poor blacks!?!?"". Funny. Like ""poor blacks"" need ""special"" attention. Good grief. Anyway most of the episodes are rehashes of other shows' plots--split personalities, espionage, etc. I will say that this show reminds me of ""The Streets of San Franciso"" in a good way. It shows an ordinary American city back then that is now a playground for the rich, over ""educated"" and delusional uber liberal. San Franciso in ""The Streets of San Francisco"" and Boston in this show.",1422144000,5,1503,4.875

My grandfather loved this when it originally aired so I bought it for him as a Christmas present. I did not personally watch any of it, but he assured me that the quality is great.",1421107200,,310,4.344827586206897
6613321,5,B00N83X2JC,"This show was excellent when it originally aired; it still stands as an excellent example of quality entertainment.

The characters in Spenser For Hire are people with depth, who respect others & life, who show genuine positive feelings for each other/other people/the world around them.  The story lines tell a complete story, not snippets of info that make no sense.

The stories are not in-your-face; you have to pay attention to what is being shown.  Many of today's viewers seem to have the attention span of gnats; with little ability to pay attention to anything for more than a few seconds.  That is not good; the less attention you pay; the less able you become to pay attention to anything.

Spenser For Hire showed the dark side of life; but balanced that with positive reactions. The Good Old Days of TV were not perfect; but at least there was a balance of what was available to watch.  I constantly search for shows such as Spenser For Hire to buy, so I can control & enjoy what I see on my TV screen.

I truly do not understand how the viewing public tolerates the type of TV and movies shown today; with the constant negative images and actions.

People like different things; so there should be a variety of choices for TV/movie viewers; not the same formula of sex, violence, disrespect for any and all things; but with different names.

If the people in charge of TV production and decision making would actually find out what folks want to see, maybe more positive TV/movies would be produced.  People need to voice their objections about what they dislike about today's entertainment; it might impact the financial bottom line for those in charge.  They might start to offer more choices; I say might.

As a consumer, I am just looking for some balance in what is available to view and/or buy for my personal entertainment.  In today's world, that choice is extremely hard to find.

I also hope that whoever has control over Spenser For Hire decides to offer the other seasons; but with the features of subtitles, scene selection, extra features, etc.",1421107200,16,2072,4.716666666666667

Unlike so many who have commented unfortunately, I can't overlook the mediocre quality of the product.  I have purchased 4-5 TV series before but none that were manufactured on demand so wasn't quite sure what to expect.  The packaging/case is cheap and bare bones compared to what I am used to with other TV series.  No extras, booklets of any sort.  I guess we are lucky they even gave us the option to play all or play individual episodes on each disk.  And the picture quality while sometimes good is sometimes about the level of what I used to expect with garden variety VHS tapes.  Certainly not the crisp, clean picture I am used to having on a DVD.  I'm thrilled to have it and eagerly await Seasons 2 and 3 but I can't given it more than 3 stars because of how mediocre the quality is.",1421020800,6,939,4.32

Robert Urich and Avery Brooks are great in this series and there isn't anything on TV right now that can really match this.
Great stories and the one liners are hilarious!!
Watching the shows you'll see actors that have gone on to other series and you'll say  ""Hey,I know that actor!""

It was a great show in the 80's and is still just as good now. It is certainly better than a lot of junk our kids are exposed to these days.

When it was syndicated we never missed a re-run and ad infinitum!  Now we can start the process all over again whenever we want.  Robert Urich was an underrated actor,as was Avery Brooks, Barbara Stock, Richard Jaeckel and Ron McLarty.  This was an ensemble cast and they performed splendidly.  I heard it mentioned (rumored) once that Robert Urich was not the first choice of Robert B. Parker to play the role of Spenser but after reading the books I'm convinced the choice was good.  Who can ever forget Hawk and his BIG piece!",1419379200,6,668,4.479338842975206
6613340,4,B00N83X2JC,"It's really satisfying to see the first season available on DVD.  Spenser was a favorite back in the day.  After all, what other emotionally vulnerable detective can knock your socks off in the boxing ring while quoting from The Faerie Queene, Romeo & Juliet, and the Bible with such aplomb?  And Avery Brooks as Hawk remains the coolest among the Cool.  The 3 stars I gave are not for the series itself, but for the relative poor sound quality of these DVDS (admittedly I'm on only disc 3 of 6).  The audio in several places is either garbled or missing, which can be frustrating.  In my copy of disc 2, it seems much of the audio is completely silent in the episode ""The Killer Within"" (I didn't bother playing it to the end to confirm).  But if you can tolerate this annoyance, the set will not disappoint those who appreciate the slightly different take compared to the typical TV detective series.

Updated comment December 27: The thought occurred to me to update the firmware on my Blue-ray player, and that has corrected the problem on disc 2 mentioned above.  The audio is fine now.  I've changed my rating from 3 to 4 stars.",1419206400,9,1134,4.541871921182266

Though I wasn't alive when this show was on the site, I've seen enough of it and other detective/crime dramas of the time to say Spenser is at the top of its class. Up there with Magnum PI.
Spenser is equal parts dark and humerous. The storylines are original and their quality separates it from other lesser shows of the period.
Spenser himself is a self proclaimed Super Sleuth with an eye for some of the finer things in life. (Namely cooking and literature which he quotes constantly)
In that respect he bears a stricking resemblance to another Boston private eye put on screen a decade or so earlier.
For whatever extras this DVD lacks, it makes up for in quality content. My only hope is that seasons 2 and 3 come out and SOON! I've been burned before by DVD companies releasing shows piece meal, then dropping them completely. Spenser for Hire is much too good a show to be locked away in a vault somewhere.

6613375,5,B00N83X2JC,"I had forgotten how much I enjoyed the ""Spenser For Hire"" show on TV. The last time I saw the show it was in re-runs on Lifetime but that was ages ago. Occasionally, I would search to see if the series was available on DVD. For a long, long time the search was unsuccessful. Then, suddenly, there it was on Amazon - Season 1 available on DVD!!. I bought it immediately and I'm not sorry at all. There's not even a little bit of buyer's remorse.
The quality of the DVDs is excellent and it seems like the episodes are complete. There are no frills like ""behind the scenes"" glimpses of the show. Who needs them? I like the stories and the characters.
Barbara Stock is beautiful as Susan. You start out thinking Susan is just Spenser's girlfriend but soon you see her as a complicated person who's way more than just some guy's exceedingly beautiful girlfriend.
Avery Brooks plays a very scary, very honorable bad guy. He's not really likeable but you'd want him as a friend. You know it takes skillful acting to pull that off.
Robert Urich as Spenser is likeable and heroic but most of all he's honorable. You can trust him with your life.
My ONLY complaint is that it's just season 1. I hope they publish the remaining 2 seasons soon so I can buy them and enjoy them. As Oliver would say: ""Please, sir, I want some more.""",1416700800,,1320,4.391836734693878

It's so exciting that Warner Brothers finally decided to release the first season of Spenser For Hire!

However, they haven't planned to release seasons 2-3 in the immediate future.  I'm trying to gather names for a show of supporters who are interested in purchasing the remaining 2 seasons.  This letter will go to Warner Brothers.

There is also a petition that you can sign to ask them for the last 2 seasons on DVD.  This is the link: http://twitition.com/mmnkz

Also, it doesn't hurt to send individual letters to Warner Brothers or post positive reviews on the WB Shop website's Spenser For Hire season 1 page!

He was born for the role.
These DVD's do NOT disappoint.  I am thrilled to have them, have been watching non-stop since I got them day before yesterday.
Someone commented that the price was too high, but you get 6 DVD's with several 1 hour episodes on each.  There's a LOT of view time.
I cannot wait for Season 2 to be released.

Now we fans can hope Seasons 2 & 3 aren't far behind. Now I wish there were extras, but I knew there wouldn't be any in all likelihood due to Urich's and author Parker's passing.

I""ll assume you like the show or wouldn't be reading this. The quality of the picture and sound of this release are quite good.

I can see why Robert Parker didn't approve of the show. Robert Urich does his best to play Spenser, but he's too earnest and emotive. The real Spenser was glib and stoic. He had emotions, but he didn't show them often.

Avery Brooks fares better as Hawk, but again, in front of a camera, he feels the need to express emotion, when we all know the real Hawk is totally  impassive.

Nevertheless, it's fun to the see the plots  of the novels acted out on screen.

To be fair, I haven't yet watched all the episodes. Maybe things get better.

Abd BTW, Susan Silverman (Barbara Stock) is exactly as irrelevant as she is in the books.

Good nostalgic entertainment that, like all Hollywood stuff, fails to capture the real flavor of the books.",1503705600,,909,4.401197604790419
