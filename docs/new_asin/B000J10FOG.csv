8148660,5,B000J10FOG,"Okay, I'm not the most knowledgeable person about what's going on in popular culture, but I'm embarrassed that I'd never heard of Rev. Billy of the Church of Stop Shopping. Frankly, I think he's a scream, as well as one of the most accurate representations of ""hell and damnation"" preaching I've ever seen. But I checked him out, and he's not doing a parody of a preacher--he IS a preacher, and sincere about his message that we've all gone crazy about buying things. Brought up in a strict Calvinist sect, his beliefs now are more like modern ""radical"" (from Latin for ""at the root"") theologians. He simply delivers the message in a fiercely old-style way.

The documentary begins with nearly-obscene scenes from a typical Christmas shopping season, with masses of shoppers waiting in early-morning darkness, in huge lines for big-box discount stores to open their doors. As people fight, struggle, and shove each other to grab plastic toys, the camera simply follows Americans as we struggle for ""gifts,"" the way lions and unfortunate antelopes struggle for water in Etosha, where someone will be eaten before the day is out. Is this a celebration of Christ's birth, or a corporate scam which has CEO's celebrating their fourth-quarter reports? Through it all, adults excuse their behavior by saying it's ""for the children."" Viewers may rightly ask: and just who taught those children this is the way Christmas should be? There are shoppers who admit that they're going into debt for this stuff.

No, it's not a PBS-style film with facts and figures, and no, there isn't a disinterested narrator guiding us through. It's entertaining, even fun, but the serious message of how we spend on a lot of things which are worthless junk will probably pertain to at least some of us. I know I've been guilty, and thank the good reverend for giving me The Word.",1403136000,,1853,4.87936507936508
8148661,4,B000J10FOG,"If you are looking for a serious and or intellectual documentary, keep looking. But if you want to see a satirically laced look at the ignorant ways people think they were standing up for freedom during the Iraq war, this is a great laugh with some sad reminders of just how duped America was.",1381190400,2,293,4.444444444444445
8148662,1,B000J10FOG,"I'd love to say I gave this documentary a fair shake, I really would. But I didn't make it half-way through before I had to turn it off to spare my brain from exploding from the stupidity. It's a shame too, the documentary started with the right intentions. It couldn't be more of a comical stereotype of LA. I probably rolled my eyes 20 times in the first 10 minutes- And I say that as a proud liberal. This was annoying and I couldn't make I past the scenes where the anti-consumerism reverend was being taken seriously.",1370736000,,522,4.391752577319588
