8078960,5,630429641X,"I originally saw this on PBS, and then was lucky enough to get both the book and the VHS tape later on from Amazon.  I also purchased a very good book on Lewis Hine from the Lourve when I was in Paris in 2000, which I also treasure.  His photographs really speak to my deepest view of America.
Many of us know that America's past is dotted with not so grand moments.  The industrial revolution at the turn of the century, with the exploitation of children and immigrants, is what Hine documents for us, and what is highlighted in this biographical accounting of his work.  He was a master at capturing human diginity in these conditions, and all of his photographs are portraits.  Its very obvious that his subjects knew of his humanity as they posed for him, and allowed the deepest parts of themselves to be revealed to him and his camera.
I have watched this VHS tape many times, and now all I have to do is hear the music and my eyes well up.  This is a very nice piece of work about a very decent American photographer who captured a stark moment of Americans in America's history.",1009929600,4,1086,4.378109452736318
