5697869,5,B00C888OQ4,"I saw this film yesterday at the WXPN Music Film Festival in Philadelphia (coordinated by the Philadelphia Film Society).  It is making the round of film festivals now and is due on DVD in July 2013.
I've followed ukulele prodigy Jake Shimabukuro's career of 11 years now (from his early albums with a band). Now he goes it alone and can hold an audience of 3,000 or more for two hours with just his ""jumping flea"" (English translation of the word ""ukulele). Watching this 58-minute film, made in 2011 and released in 2012, I still learned new things about Jake. We get to see his mother and brother as well as his new wife and his now-former manager, Kaz Flanagan. He's a father now but his son was born after the film was completed. Luckily Jake was filmed throughout his long career (he's only in his early 30s but started playing at age four.) and a lot of that footage was used by the filmmakers.

If you know Jake and his music you'll really enjoy this film (I loved it!) and if you've only heard his name - or maybe are one of the THREE MILLION people who have seen the YouTube video of him in Central Park playing ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"", then - after watching this film, you'll probably run out and buy Jake's CDs. And then tell your friends about it.

I'm hoping there were be bonus performances when the DVD is released (and I'll update my review then) but , for now, catch it on the big screen if you have the opportunity.

UPDATE (6/21/13): I've now seen the DVD and, sadly, there are no bonus features (even outtakes) included. I'm still giving the DVD five stars but sure wish they included full performances so you could watch on your TV in HD or at least big screen.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5697922,3,B00C888OQ4,"This is a ""nice"" movie, especially for people who are more into the players home life, philosophy, and romantic attitudes about playing ukuleles, and how he met his wife.

If you're a hard core Ukulele player that wants to see lots and lots of Shimabukuro songs and how he arranged them, then this will be a very disappointing few hours.

I expected more ukulele and less schmaltz.",1436745600,,381,4.6716417910447765

5697926,5,B00C888OQ4,I really enjoyed the video on Jake's life and his growth in playing the eukelele over the years.  We have seen him in concert several times and he is a fantastic eukelele player and very entertaining! He is extremely personable and has an amazing ability to play the eukelele in so many different styles of music.  He can definitely make the instrument sing beautifully!,1433376000,,370,4.765625

5697940,5,B00C888OQ4,Incredible story,1431820800,,16,7.5
5697941,5,B00C888OQ4,"I, like many of the of the mainland Americans, never took the ukelele seriously. I had no idea of its stature in Hawaii, Seeing the likes of Tiny Tim and others use it as light accompaniment to their singing seemed to reduce its status to a baby guitar. That all changed in a heartbeat while viewing this documentary.

Here's the scoop. This film chronicles the life of Jake Shimabukuro roughly from his beginning to play the ukelele at age four to his entering the entertainment industry and beyond.

This is a truly remarkable eye opener. Never have I seen the ukelele played like this. And to hear it adapt itself to so many types of music. Jake plays rock, classical, jazz, blues and on. He plays effortlessly, beautifully and with such emotion I was awed that such a range of expression could be had from such a small instrument sporting only two octaves. And his evolution of thinking about his playing when he began to realize how much can be said in the space between the notes.

He is shown through all the times of his career. Early episodes with him playing in the band ""Pure Heart"" and on with all types of bands as well as accompanying noted singers. He was (is?) the go to guy (much like The Chieftans) for many in the music field. He himself is very engaging. He seems like a genuinely nice person and loves to perform. He is by no means a quiet performer. But listening to him talk you realize he has no boundaries. He will constantly reexamine his instrument and expand/adapt it to all styles of music.

I realize it might be difficult to impart how wonderful it is to see him play what might have been considered a minor instrument. But, believe me, it's like watching a violin virtuoso. I know whose CDS are going on my next birthday list.

This is as good a documentary as I've ever seen. Dig it.",1431475200,,1816,4.457831325301205
5697942,5,B00C888OQ4,"What a lovely way to spend an hour!  Not only is Jake a consummate musician, he is a wonderful human being: his story was touching, funny, inspiring, and it was delightful to gain a little insight into what has made him the incredible master of the ukelele he is today!  I HIGHLY recommend this video to anyone who loves a heart-warming human interest story and loves great music.  The guy plays ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" on the uke, for cryin' out loud!  You gotta watch this /-)",1429142400,,474,4.541176470588235

It is very easy to connect with Jake in the movie just as he connects with his audiences in his concerts.
We had a wonderful trip to the Big Island, Hawaii. I had heard about JS, but went seeking out his music and his life story soon after our return. I feel truly rewarded after watching this movie.

I'm going to encourage everyone, young and old that is willing to be inspired to watch this movie!

Shimabukuro's life as a ukelele virtuoso is presented in full circle and includes some of the most inspirational interviews I've ever seen from a documentary of this genre. Jake does a fabulous job of giving credit where it is due. He respects the instrument and the musical roots for which it was designed.

Whether you are a musician or not, this film is one you won't want to miss. I'm pretty sure I'll be watching it a third time, something I've never done, not even with ""Star Wars.""",1407628800,,594,4.5

Jake is a true genuine, honest, and truly nice guy.  Anyone who will go to elementary schools to share their gift has a very special relationship with their own identity.

Jake's think-outside-the-box approach to his instrument will make you forget for a while that there ever was a box. But the best part of this documentary is that the viewer leaves the experience feeling a connection to Jake's life.

Excellent. Enjoy MFJLabs 5x",1394582400,,430,4.657894736842105

This young man dedicated his life from the age of 4 years old to music and his beloved ukulele.  He is the greatest ambassador of this instrument ever and someone, Hawaii has been so proud of for so many years. The video is unique in that it truly shows this young man in his inner most thoughts, dreams ambitions and daily life, as he truly is.  This is so hard for biographers and film documentarians to do---to capture the real person.  This was only possible because Jake Shimabukuro is very transparent, very authentic  What you see is the entirety of who he is.  This is the best video I have ever seen about Jake's life---complete, sincere and honest---just like the man.  Excellent job!!  Excellent product!!",1389916800,,829,4.6689655172413795

5698132,5,B00C888OQ4,"A film and a man for our time.  Jake could never have had this success in the low tech 50's without serious sponsorship.  YouTube became the snow ball rolling down a hill and provided him the momentum and exposure he needed to succeed.  I play a number of string instruments and I am impressed by his virtuosity, but of equal weight is his showmanship.  Jake is a performer and that makes all the difference, but he does not get wrapped up in himself.  He gets wrapped up in his audience.

This is a feel good film with mind bending virtuosity on the ukulele, but most of all about the relationships of a young man with discipline, humility and gratitude.  Centered in family and rooted in his culture, he is more than an artist.  He is plainly a nice guy.",1389139200,,756,4.388489208633094

5698137,5,B00C888OQ4,"Jake Shimabukuro is an amazing talent.

5698142,5,B00C888OQ4,It is so nice to see a talented artist who doesn't misbehave and posture for attention. Jake uses his gift to spread the power of music in any form to others. The faces of the elderly tsunami survivors tell the whole story. The ukulele has been oft maligned as a hokey toy instrument. Jake puts disbelievers in their place through his talent and the pure joy of his performances.,1387843200,,379,4.507246376811594

5698147,5,B00C888OQ4,"I had never heard of Jake Shimabukuro and only watched the film on PBS because I had seen the Director Tadashi Nakamura's previous films, which were very well done.  I was actually surprised that the screening at the Asian Pacific Film Festival in LA was sold out.  I didn't know there were so many ukelele fans in LA.  When I saw the film on PBS, I was thoroughly amazed.  Not only was the documentary adeptly directed, edited, and paced, but it was such a revelation of a musical genius.  I then understood why the screening was sold out.  Jake is a phenomenal talent, but also such a self-effacing and humble person.  I've already given the documentary several times as a gift, and it will be my stocking stuffer for Christmas.  Since seeing the film I was lucky enough to see Jake live a few weeks ago.  It was one of the best concerts I every been to.  I rarely recommend anything so unequivocally, but everyone to whom I have shown or given the DVD has loved it.  I've probably seen it six to ten times with friends.  It's definitely a DVD to have in your collection.",1380499200,2,1073,4.418367346938775
5698148,2,B00C888OQ4,"I didn't like the movie very much. I was expecting a movie about the ukulele. This one is more about Jake, his music career, challenges of pioneering as a ukulele soloist etc. If your interested in these things then you should watch the movie and you'll like it.",1379462400,,262,4.479166666666667

5698163,5,B00C888OQ4,Great overview of Jake Shimabukuro life from his start to the viral video that put Jake as a virtuoso for the ukelele. No one comes close to his talent on the ukelele.,1376524800,,167,4.25
5698164,5,B00C888OQ4,"Saw this show on PBS about a month ago, and had to get a copy of it to send to my son who lives in Finland. Turns out that what I ordered was a ""pre-sell"", and had to wait and wait - but it's here and I watched it again. Still fabulous. Sending  it off to my son who plays banjo and guitar, and to two grandaughters who have played guitar in concerts for several years. If you know anyone who loves their stringed instruments, they're gonna love you for this! It's an uplifting, warm-hearted biography of a truly amazing and gifted young man, who is obviously an enlightened being and a ""teacher"" in more ways than one! And...even very young kids will appreciate this - you don't need to censor it at all.",1374019200,4,705,4.2611940298507465

5698166,5,B00C888OQ4,"I have been a fan of Jake's playing for some time.  This movie really moved me.  I think it is his energy or postive light that just shines so clearly through out the movie that really inspired.  It seemed to be just what I needed when I watched it late that night on PBS.  I enjoyed it so much I purchased a copy of my own and watched it several times now and have shared it with friends.  As a guitar player I can relate so strongly to his comments about the instrument bringing a sense of peace to a persons life during trying times.  The last segment of the film in Japan, which if you notice every reviewer is commenting on, is so incredibly moving/powerful.  It has brought me to tears each time I have viewed it.  If someone ever wanted an argument as to why your kids should take up an instrument here it is.  The movie is sort of like the music Jake describes....it breathes and is rather quiet/subtle in spots but if you watch closely the messages are really inspring and beautiful.",1372464000,,992,4.290322580645161
5698167,5,B00C888OQ4,"Jake Shimabukuro is not a ""ukulele player"" -- he's a world-renowned musical virtuoso who blows away anyone who hears his music. He is in the same pantheon as Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Bela Fleck, and even great classical musicians such as Yo-Yo Ma and Hilary Hahn. Jake, more than any musician I know of, transcends his instrument and creates pure music, touching the souls of his listeners.

A well-kept (though award-winning) Hawaiian and Japanese secret until 2006, Jake burst upon the world stage when someone posted the now-famous video of him playing ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" on YouTube. The video instantly went viral, and Jake became a international star, receiving concert requests from around the world, and playing with and opening for such stars as Jimmy Buffett, Bela Fleck, Ziggy Marley, and Bette Midler, and being produced by Alan Parsons.

All while retaining his youthful humility and disarming openness and lack of pretense. This movie is a lovely look into his life, both for Jake fans, and for those who have never heard of him. The film is by turns fascinating, jaw-dropping, inspiring, funny, touching, and moving. It's a well-rounded and expertly done piece of cinema by a very experienced Japanese-American documentarian, who strives to bring the human touch to his work. The film should appeal to anyone, regardless of age, nationality, or musical interest (or lack thereof). Jake's life alone is fascinating, never mind his brilliant music (which we are given glorious exposure to).

Jake has a special connection with Japan, both through his heritage and because his longtime manager is from Japan. Thus, he's an even bigger star in Japan than in the U.S. Hopefully, this wonderful film will open the eyes of further music lovers in the U.S. and elsewhere around the world.

By the way, this hour-long documentary is viewable for free until August 8, 2013 on the PBS site. Go to their Video page, and click the drop-down Progams menu (or access it directly here: http://goo.gl/cDN0T).",1369094400,11,2020,5.075301204819277
5698168,5,B00C888OQ4,"I too saw this on PBS - I have no idea if it was the full version, but it was absolutely spectacular.  To know that Jake learned to play the ukulele because it was a way to feel close to his musically talented single mom, who he couldn't spend much time with because she was a bar singer and working long hours and late nights to provide a home for Jake and his little brother ... well that gave me a greater understanding of his need to excel on this instrument.  To see Jake share his instrument with pre-school children, teenagers, and then again with seniors in assisted living was really special. He was able to connect with them all on a very intimate level.  And then on to play at some of the best musical venues in the world. His ability to connect on an emotional level with all ages and different musical genres is truly amazing.

I'm not going to write too much about Jake's incredible talent, because it's all been said before.  However, to realize that he has achieved this level of competence at such a young age is quite remarkable. Although not without an incredible amount of practice! (Note to self: practice more often).  I think he is an excellent example for young people of how you can achieve something through perseverence and not necessarily through spending thousands of dollars on private lessons or expensive equipment.

And yes, this film was definitely all the more moving when he returned to Japan with his manager to visit what used to be her home town which was devastated by the earthquake/tsunami.

I'm hoping the DVD has some extras on it!

Absolutely not to be missed.",1369094400,4,1606,4.56794425087108
5698169,5,B00C888OQ4,"I saw the film on PBS this afternoon and was moved, enriched and entertained by it.  I was familiar with Jake's music and have appreciated the way he can get wonderful feeling out of what others might consider a very limited instrument.  He can create exquisite lyrical statements....his version of George Harrison's While My Guitar Gently Weeps is justly famous.....join the millions who've seen the YouTube version shot in New York's Central Park.  In this documentary we learn about the Hawaii and family environment he emerged from, his special relationship with a Japanese woman who is his business manager and his romance and ultimate marriage to his wife.  Extremely moving is Jake's visit to his business manager's home city in Japan which was devastated by the tsunami.",1368316800,5,778,5.102362204724409
