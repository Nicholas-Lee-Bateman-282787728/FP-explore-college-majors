341901,4,6301643410,"This movie projects the come back of the ""Streets of San Francisco"" of the 70s but the setting is in the city of Osaka, Japan.  In this movie, Michael Douglas teamed up with young stud, Andy Garcia, both  cops in battling a Japanese syndicate who is involved in counterfeiting  money.  Packed with action and motorcycle stunts,  this movie depicts a  difficult alliance with both cultures in battling crime, but in the end  comes a common understanding of putting the bad guys behind bars.  Subtitles in english is not an option although they are shown when japanese  is spoken.  nice flick!",923616000,,591,4.82

341915,5,6301643410,"Black Rain is a 1989 action thriller from Paramount Pictures, which was directed by the legendary Ridley Scott. It depicts the exploits of two New York City Police Department detectives, who arrest a member of one of the most notorious Japanese organized crime syndicates, after they witness him murdering a rival gang member in a bar. Its story line centers on their mission of transferring this gangster to Osaka, Japan, where he is to stand trial for murder, and the complications and mayhem that ensue, after this transfer is completely compromised. Black Rain is characterized by action, drama, and suspense, as well as a dark and foreboding atmosphere, created by the stunning visuals used to depict the Japanese underworld. In addition, this film provides interesting insight into the unique aspects of the Japanese customs, culture, and mindset. Black Rain features excellent performances by its lead actors, Michael Douglas, Andy Garcia, and Ken Takakura, as well as superb performances by its supporting actors, including Yusaku Matsuda, Kate Capshaw, and John Spencer, to name a few. Black Rain is an outstanding action thriller film, which is decidedly engaging and entertaining, and it merits a five-star rating, along with an enthusiastic recommendation.",1497312000,5,1268,5.376884422110553

341933,4,6301643410,"Vintage Michael Douglas and Andy Garcia. A good cop show with well developed and formed characters. Both Garcia and Douglas (both good actors) make for sympathetic policemen. Set mostly in Japan the story sometimes feels clichd when depicting Japanese policemen (as well as all Japanese men) as rigid/self-important, non-intelligent, and non-sexual /  and White blond women fetishized by Japanese men (Eddy a Japanese entitled rich guy eating sushi off naked blond woman). But this was made a few years ago so I'll give the movie a pass on that aspect. (Besides nowadays it seems like the tables have turned where in US the White entitled men fetishize Asian women. Lets see if MOVIES start depicting this little turn of events).

Really good entertainment and an increasing from downer to upbeat story makes this movie a winner for me.",1485561600,2,836,5.050724637681159

341945,4,6301643410,"When I first saw this film in 1989 I was 39 years old. At that age I enjoyed it as an intense action thriller with some moving undertones. The culture clashes are illuminating. The karaoke scene is priceless. The ending is sweet. In between all that, the action is always fast moving.

Watching the movie now, at the age of 67, I still feel very much the same. There is only one significant change in my perspective. At age 39, I saw Douglas' character, Nick, as strongly macho. These days though I see that level of machismo as arrogance bordering on stupidity, an arrogance which gets people killed. That doesn't detract from the film for me but simply gives it an added dimension. For Douglas' character clearly learns and grows throughout the movie. Since I was arrogantly macho in my own younger days but have hopefully moved beyond that these days, I very much appreciate such a journey.",1485043200,3,893,4.651898734177215

341948,5,6301643410,"**NO SPOILER REVIEW**  I really liked this movie.  This movie has some amazing cinematography, and does a fairly good job of portraying the culture shock that an American would experience during a first time visit to Japan, even though it's somewhat simplified and is also trying to be a buddy cop movie where there's also a good cop/bad cop dynamic.  Bottom line is, it's a movie, some themes will have to simplified otherwise it'd be a 3 hour slog.

The concepts of ""GAIJIN"" and Japanese police culture aren't fully explained so if you take some time to learn about these two things beforehand it makes the movie much more cohesive and ... well, just helps things make more sense.  The movie 'Freakonomics' details a fascinating aspect of Japanese police culture which is on full display in this film, I highly recommend you watch that segment in 'Freakonomics' on Japanese policing (probably 20-30 minutes long) I'd also suggest you briefly read up on Japanese people's disdain for a ""Gaijin"" prior to watching this movie if you aren't familiar with either concept.  It will greatly enhance your viewing experience.  Also keep in mind that in Japanese culture, saving face and maintaining honor (in all aspects of life, not just policing) is of the utmost importance, this will help explain why the Japanese seemed to do some of the things they did in the movie.  It wasn't that unrealistic if you ask me.

FYI:  I served overseas as a military servicemember in Tokyo (so I WAS the Gaijin), this is partially why I enjoyed the film so much.  If you lived in Japan like I did you probably don't need to read up on ""Gaijin"" or research too deeply into Japanese culture since you're already familiar.

I'm rating this 5 stars because some other people rated the movie way too low imo, the cinematography alone is 5 star quality, the plot is somewhat predictable at times but there are a few surprising twists so I wasn't disappointed.  If you ever traveled to Japan (which would help you understand and enjoy the film's setting easier) or if you enjoy Asian themed cop flicks (i.e. Police Story, Supercop, etc.) then you'll like this movie.  I watched the Amazon Prime streaming version, so for a free movie on Prime it's definitely worth a watch!",1484784000,15,2247,4.757731958762887

342238,4,6301643410,"A good storyline with Andy Garcia and a Japanese English-speaking policeman as two very likeable cops. (Michael Douglas makes the grade only at the last minute of the movie.) The film gets its name from a Yakuza boss who saw black rain falling over Tokyo when B-52s carpet-bombed it. (Given that the movie was made in 1989, the boss's glee at America's industrial downfall compared to Japan was understandable and all-too-real.) There were a few scenes like this (e.g., the Douglas character's admission that he stole a drug dealer's money) which made the movie all the more complex and enjoyable. And while not many, there were a few surprises--the one involving Andy Garcia's character being the biggest. 4 1/2 stars",1480809600,,718,4.991666666666666

It's a highly engaging cross cultural action tour de force that reflects upon the stereotypes both cultures hold of the other. Contrary to the insistence of the prodigious and sanctimonious windbags of the politically correct class, this is precisely why the film has become a near cult classic despite all efforts to dismiss it.  The ability of the characters to ultimately transcend their own cultural myopia in the context of a great action packed and suspense filled film makes this a must see for anyone not willing to be stifled or intimidated by the empty rhetorical tripe of the self appointed thought police.",1462665600,,716,4.966666666666667

342490,4,6301643410,"Entertaining late-'80s thriller from Ridley Scott that uses its Japanese setting as almost a secondary character, elevating certain action sequences to standout effect. Michael Douglas is a touch over-the-top as a maverick NYC cop going up against the Yakuza after a prisoner transfer goes awry, yet on the whole the entire cast works well together, notably Ken Takakura as the noble Tokyo detective tasked with wrangling his American counterpart.  As one of the lesser-known films in Scott's oeuvre, well worth seeing, even though the version streaming on Amazon could benefit from a complete remastering - especially with such a spectacular backdrop as Japan, a cleaner video transfer would benefit the experience immeasurably.",1454976000,,729,5.508928571428571

342761,1,6301643410,"Black Rain, 1989 film

It begins in Manhattan. A divorced detective sees his children. He is under investigation because of his debts. Then he and a friend go to a restaurant. Two men walk in, one stabs and kills another, his partner has a machine gun to preserve order. [The darkness of these scenes detracts from the story.] The knife wielder is caught by the police. Why are the Yakuzi and the Mafia collaborating? The Japanese Government wants this killer returned. Who will do it? [This restaurant is bugged by the police.] Nick and Vince are chosen. After they land the prisoner is turned over to Japanese policemen. Afterwards real Japanese policemen arrive! Nick has to explain it to his superiors. [Was there a fault in the procedure?] How did they get into a secure area? Nick wants to continue the search.

A policeman is assigned to be their guide. The NY policemen must surrender their guns, they are civilians here. One of the phony policemen is found but he will not talk. There is a mob war going on. [Is Nick arrogant?] Motorcyclists rider around them. Nick learns about Santo. Police with rifles hold a training exercise. Nick talks to one suspect. This isn't New York he is told. Nick explains how that money is counterfeit but is very good. There is a scene in a night club. Then they leave. Will one be decoyed into a dangerous situation? Nick is upset and acts in a destructive manner. There is nothing here. Is a large sequin a clue? They follow that woman, she passes an envelope to a man! They follow that man. The deal is for a plate to make counterfeit US currency. This meeting takes place in a steel plant. Nick does his best but loses his man.

The Japanese police put Nick on an airplane to America. But he leaves to go to an apartment building to find Maso. Later he finds the Big Man, who tells about his youth when a lone B-29 flew over the city and the Black Rain that followed. Nick offers a deal, he will take care of Santo. Later Santo makes amends in the traditional manner. Following this is a typical shooting scene between mobsters. [In case you fell asleep.] Then there is a motorcycle chase in the countryside. There is a crash and a fight. Nick uses his head to win. Nick brings in his man for the ending. Congratulations. He is a regular hero says that blonde.

This could have been a better movie without all those dark scenes and with a better and less confusing story. It could have shown scenes of the countryside. You will learn little from this movie. Was the story composed by a committee with conflicting points of view? The plot is about creating counterfeit US currency in America. I would imagine that creating counterfeit US currency would be best done in Asia or Europe, there is more demand and less worry about the US Secret Service.",1447113600,,2794,4.537698412698413

342797,3,6301643410,"Okay as of this writing I'm the 250th person to review this pretty good film.

Foul-mouthed and crude living Michael Douglas is a cop who disdains the rules. he does what he wants to do when he wants to do it. he rides a motorcycle and races them illegaly for money. Did I mention he was a cop? Yeah, I did. Not just one of New York's finest but a dirty cop--a cop who takes money from drug dealers in order to take care of his expenses.

Douglas's character witnesses a murder with his partner and they arrest the yakuza member and ship him back to japan. Unfortunately they lose the prisoner to those who dupe them into thinking they are cops.

In the process of hunting the murderer down, Douglass's partner, (Andy Garcia's Character) is brutally slain. This leads him into the dark underbelly of the Japanese Yakuza, an organization as old and potent as the Mafia in Italy or the Milieu of France or the Triads in China. Unfortunately this is where the movie takes an unrealistic turn.

Another reason for the movie's slackness is due to too many characters. What happened to the girl that Douglass and his Japanese partner were following? What happened to the Yakuza Oyabun who was stabbed in the hand during the movie's climax? What about all of the other Mafia Oyabun who were attending the meeting? These questions were never answered in the movie.

This movie was quite dark in tone and look. Like most of Ridley Scott's films, the texture of the film seemed muted and quite dour, even during the daylight hours. Any other director would have had a different look to this film. I give it Three out of Five Stars. Slightly above average in my opinion. Kate Capshaw had little with which to work with. She was basically a 1980s version of Willie Scott, a similar character that was showcased in Temple of Doom, set in 1935. Both characters were indistinguishable from each other despite the 50 years' difference. perhaps her 1988 character was a bit smarter and less ignorant. But that was about all.

I bought this movie on DVD and it's slightly above average in my opinion. Leonard Maltin gave it Two and a Half Stars out of Four. I agree with his take. That translates to Three out of Five Stars. Buy this DVD at your own risk!

While the plot is mostly predictable, there are some nice moments of contrast between the gruff New York cop(s) and the quiet Japanese officer as they try to catch the usual upstart young gangster who doesn't respect the old ways. It's well shot and has that hazy, gritty feel that lends a lot to the atmosphere, while the music alternates between traditional and symphonic.

Overall, worth checking out on a lazy Saturday, but don't expect something that will stay with you once it's over.",1423094400,,695,4.791666666666667

But Black Rain totally engaged me from the very beginning with its truly magnificent musical editing to its truly magnificent cinematography. Music and visuals carefully edited to create a symphony of sensuality, a feast for the senses.

The story line was not tainted with useless extraneous love scenes, its power enhanced with fierce brilliant acting. It is a thriller. It is a brilliant film made more than the sum of its parts by its editing.

In Black Rain, Michael Douglas is in trouble for graft.  Then he captures, and loses, a key soldier in a Japanese crime syndicate. The film follows him back to Japan, the home of the escaped crime lieutenant, where he struggles with the criminals, the deskbound local police, and his own demons.  The co-stars, including Andy Garcia and Kate Capshaw, are absolutely brilliant too.  The film never lags, disappoints, or is predictable.  A very small flaw was the politcal correctness: the title of the film, 'black rain', is the complaint of the head of the yakuza(crime syndicate), who blames America for the a-bomb attack at Hiroshima.  We could debate that, but suffice it to say, the film doesn't have a debate as to whether Pearl Harbor started the entire Pacific war...",1406937600,,922,4.767295597484277

343372,5,6301643410,"""Black Rain"" is a period piece, set during the decline of the Soviet Union and years before 911. So this fish-out-of-water, 'Odd Couple' of cops movie portrays the prevailing American world view of that time: That Japan seemed technologically, if not militarily, poised to become the next great global superpower.

The plot basically revolves around two cops: Michael Douglas's brash, New York City-bred Nick Conklin and Takakura Ken's priggish, Osaka-born Masamoto. The script is very film noirish--loaded with irony and distrust--as Conklin faces theft charges back home. Nevertheless, he is tapped to escort the ruthless Yakuza [Japanese mafia] enforcer Sato back to Japan. Once the gangster cleverly escapes extradition, Conklin and his stylish partner Charlie Vincent (Andy Garcia) struggle to capture him on his own turf.

The xenophobia of both late 80's America and Japan saturates every scene, highlighted by Japanese characters' quotes as ""Now, music and movies are all America is good for!"" and American counterpunches as ""If there was one of you guys who had an original idea, you'd be so tight that you couldn't pull it out of your [rear]!""

The writers, however, almost overdo the clash of cultures concept. The obtrusive, ill-mannered Conklin is unsympathetic for the first half of the movie. And Masamoto is rigid, blinded by by-the-book duty to his superiors. It is only through a personal tragedy later on that Conklin and Masamoto bond and become more likeable and effective.

Perhaps ""Black Rain's"" greatest strength is director Ridley Scott's extraordinary efforts behind the scenes. His dark, rainy style (though not the source of the title) imbue the sets and photography and wonderfully set the mood. And, if you watch the accompanying behind-the-scenes extras, Scott works overtime to perform some nifty feats of international diplomacy and location trickery that save the movie!

All-in-all, ""Black Rain"" is a very good action movie that pulls no punches (physical or verbal). Its top-notch production values complement a script which fairly accurately portrays the growing paranoia of its time through two headstrong leads (who must somehow bridge deep cultural differences in order to capture a dangerous criminal fugitive).",1378598400,,2252,5.422857142857143

Suddenly, a young Japanese bursts into the restaurant and after a violent verbal exchange with his fellow countrymen, stabs one of them. Conklin and Vincent try to capture the assailant but he escapes. When he is later captured, the two detectives are charged by their superior, Captain Oliver (John Spencer), with delivering him back to his homeland. They hand him over at Tokyo airport only to find that the `policemen' to whom he has been surrendered are bogus. The rest of this very exciting movie is about the efforts the American detectives make to recapture their suspect, evading the Japanese police (as they are acting without authority) and trying to find out what the fight in the restaurant was all about. The head of the local Yakusa claims that they do not forge counterfeit U.S. currency for profit but to repay America for the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki that produced days of `black rain' in their wake. The Japanese dialogue is given subtitles when the information is relevant. A good movie!",1369699200,,1283,4.944444444444445
343410,4,6301643410,"Seems a lot of members here didn't care all that much for this film. Perhaps it is because they expected some kind of near masterpiece due to the fact that Ridley Scott directed it. After all this film came after Alien and Blade Runner, which are both timeless classics. Part of the problem is that this film feels very dated, but upon its release it got over all rave reviews from the critics. For its time it had a refreshing technically ahead of its time quality to it. It reminds me of Miami Vice in that during its time it seemed very cutting edge but now also feels cheesy and terribly dated. But for its time this movie was a solidly crafted detective thriller that was a real cut above the rest. One member commented in their review that this was one of Michael Douglass lesser known films. Well that is really not very true, because during its run in theaters it did very well and was one of the highest grossing films for its year. The story taking NY city cops out of their familiar turf and into the strange land of Japan hadnt really been done before to any memorable standard, but this film in its time was a real treat. Douglas and Garcia play thier characters to fit perfectly with this kind of subject mattter and Scott does a brilliant job with presenting the japanese aspect beautifully. The film has plenty of breathtaking action, great locations, vivid cinematography, and solid direction from Scott.

343476,5,6301643410,"Black Rain follows Nick (Michael Douglas) and Charlie (Andy Garcia), who arrest a member of the Yakuza. They are ordered to escort him back to Japan, where he escapes. Nick and Charlie team up with the reluctant Osaka police and delve deep into the criminal underworld. Black Rain is an all-round magnificent film, with beautiful cinematography and a stunning score.

The story in this film is great; it follows a familiar story/character arc, but it's entertaining, nonetheless. It has action, drama, suspense, and it's occasionally funny- and it's all balanced very well. The story moves at a consistent pace and the storytelling is smooth; this combination manages to keep the audience interested and engaged. Michael Douglas' performance is great, as well as the rest of the cast. The cinematography in this film is amazing- it is a beautifully shot film, like much of Ridley Scott's filmography. The music in this film is outstanding, probably Hans Zimmer's most understated soundtrack. It's a film that can stand the test of time, it never felt outdated and can compete with the best of today, from a technical and story point of view.

I own the Blu-ray version of the film. The picture quality is great, and the audio quality is good. In terms of picture and audio quality, it's not the best upgrade (""Blade Runner"" and ""Taxi Driver"" are examples of excellent upgrades) , but it's currently the best version of this film. The film is on a single disc, it has a few special features, including The Making Of, Commentary from Ridley Scott, and Previews.

Overall, Black Rain is a beautifully shot, stunningly scored, and masterfully told film. It's as enjoyable today as it was yesterday or will be tomorrow. I HIGHLY recommend a purchase. Although the Blu-ray isn't perfect, it's the version to own, whether you're upgrading or purchasing for the first time.

Black Rain has strong violence and blood.",1363046400,2,1908,4.971786833855799

Once there, he escapes, and the two police officers find themselves dragged deeper and deeper into the Japanese underworld. The film was directed by Ridley Scott, whom all of you know as the Director of Alien and Blade Runner.

Most of the time, I'm not really into movies of this sort. Why? Well, movies of this sort are, usually, an excuse for lots of violence and action in the movie. I'm more into characterization and a good tale, something a little deeper-shall we say. I do like a good action movie every once in awhile but I prefer the aforementioned more in my movies(course, you wouldn't know that with all the zombie movies I've reviewed as of late, lol). At any rate, this movie gave me both and in good measure. I'm quite surprised at how well Michael Douglas and Andy Garcia play off each others' strengths in this movie to make it believable that these two are more like family than friends. Kate Capshaw and Ken Takakura put in very good performances as well. I agree with another reviewer here that Garcia & Takakura's Karoake scene is priceless...it's my favorite scene in the whole movie, lol. It's a brilliant movie, a deep movie and a fun movie...all rolled into one.

343583,5,6301643410,"I've been a fan of Black Rain since I first saw it on HBO, decades ago.  Its been a go-to movie for me since then, on VHS, cable, DVD, Special Edition DVD...seen em all.  You dissect a film like Black Rain, and the individual parts may not make you think ""classic"", but to look on it as a whole, it has ""something"", an intangible vibe that captures an embellished world you want to revisit. Michael Douglas' acting is outstanding even if he is unlikable, and Andy Garcia mumbles through his lines with a sincerity that foreshadows his amazing career. Supporting cast is mostly strong, Hans Zimmer hits it OUT OF THE PARK soundtrack wise (this score has been used and reused several times in random movie trailers and the like, which exemplifies its longevity), and Ridley Scott directs the smoky, high contrast worlds of New York and Japan.  Again, I cant quite put my finger on what makes it such a great film, but its there, and maybe you had to be there, growing up with the movie all these years.  I'd be interested to hear what a first time reviewer would think about the movie juxtaposed to modern action/dramas.

Several have bashed the Blu-ray treatment, and I'm not saying I haven't seen better, but I've seen worse, and this is far from them.  The picture, to me, is clear as I've seen it, and reflecting back on the many versions over the years, its the best I would imagine would could expect, from a shot-on-film movie from the 80s.  Considering the source material, its pretty amazingly sharp, with details popping out that I hadn't noticed over the course of many, many viewings.  The copter-pan as they fly into Japan, overlooking the hazy industrial setting looks vibrant saturated, and it never took on that life the 30+ times I had seen it before.

The DTS track is nice, although inconsistent - music booms and various action scenes pop out, but slower paced dialogue drops back a bit too much, level-wise.  I watched it on a solid surround system, and it required some adjustment to either hear the voices or not get blown out of your seat by various sound effects.  The Dolby 5.1 is fine overall, but has nowhere near the weight of the DTS track.

Parts of the movie hold up over the many years, and to say they don't make em like they used to would be accurate.  The gritty earnestness of a movie like this is what made pre-CGI movies so special, and classics that, frankly, won't be produced again.  Fantastic film, and great to own it on such a remarkable media.",1310860800,21,2487,4.559550561797753

The sheen and polish of Scott's urban landscapes is a sight to behold. Black Rain is almost like a neo Tokyo, anime version of Blade Runner, only filmed in Osaka! It's pretty amazing just how much the look of Blade Runner was influenced by Asian metropolises and then Blade Runner influenced the look of a lot of anime in return. Black Rain is total cheese, a completely by the numbers American cop movie filled to the brim with excessive cliches and all that the genre implies but it's a masterpiece of art design and production values. It simply reeks of Hollywood excess and gratuitous surfaces polished to perfection. The look of the movie on Blu-ray makes your mouth water if you are a cinema enthusiast. Rare instances from the sleazy 1980s gave us such absolutely stunning and sophisticated urban imagery captured on film and unfortunately all for nothing.

Compare this movie with it's art design predecessor Blade Runner and you'll see just how empty and decadent Black Rain truly is. It's a buddy cop movie made by highly paid Madison Avenue designer types. Jan De Bont is the cinematographer here, ( he went on direct ""Speed"" and ""Twister"" ), and he knows exactly how to get that perfect look that is the imprimatur of nearly every Ridley Scott production. All the Ridley trademarks are here in evidence, the smoke emitting from the streets, the endless neon lights, the motorcycles, the reflections off all metallic surfaces, the rain soaked atmosphere. Everything is hip, flashy and beyond decadent. However the plot is basic police story stuff, the characters are cardboard cut outs that the talented cast somehow manage to humanize and the subsequent revenge narrative is all too familiar.

Beyond the stunning high-def visuals, the audio is also very good and the special features are terrific. The actors and the director discuss the shoot and how difficult it was filming in Osaka, Japan with all the rules and regulations governing film production there. Ridley Scott, Michael Douglas and Andy Garcia try to stress how much they care about this movie but it won't convince me or anyone with a brain that this film is nothing more than a gorgeous looking, atmospheric mess. But what a fantastic looking mess! The two Japanese male leads who play counterpoint to the Americans portrayed by Douglas and Garcia are also terrific actors. Ken Takakura as the good cop and Yasuku Matsuda as the villain. Matsuda died shortly after this film wrapped and I suppose Black Rain is as good a vehicle to showcase his talents to the international film world as any foreign actor could hope for. Even Kate Capshaw does a good job in a thankless role as the lone American woman working as a hostess in a nightclub. Amazing that all these talented actors could somehow squeeze some humanity out of such a leaden, bare essentials screenplay.

I can't end without mentioning the musical score by Hans Zimmer which combines ripely melodic electronics mixed with orchestra and a far east flavor. This is one of the best scores of his career. The main song of the movie, ""I'll Be Holding On"" is also by Zimmer with vocals by Gregg Allman. It's just a big-hearted pop ballad from that gloriously excessive decade called the eighties! Black Rain is a guilty pleasure no doubt but it's no crime once in a while to let your eyes glaze over from such a rich visual tapestry. To be mesmerized by sheer elegance without caring about narrative or anything else. Just beautiful looking moving pictures.",1256774400,4,3646,4.877419354838709

343659,5,6301643410,"Black Rain stars detective Michael Douglass as Nick with his partner Andy Garcia as Charlie. They're both New York cops. Right from the beginning of the film we see Nick motorcyle racing in the streets. So we know he's somewhat of a wild cop. After that he has an internal affairs interegation on him, and we meet his partner Charlie along the way. There's a nice contrast to the reason he's investigated and the choices he makes later in the film.

Nick and Charlie have their first encounter with an upcoming Yakuza member Sato played by Yusaku Matsuda in a resturaunt. He plays a very good villian. Sato and his henchmen interrupt a deal going on. The detectives just happen to be relaxing at that same resturaunt. Nick and Charlie soon go after Sato. They end up capturing him but not too easily.
At this point the movie changes completly with how the main characters have to deal with anything. All what happend before was only 20 minutes in New York. They are requested to transport Sato as prisoner back to Japan.

Unfortunately Sato makes a very tricky escape and eludes the two detectives. They are brought before the police chief of that area of Japan. They argue with the chief to finaly be allowed to stay as observers to finding Sato. Even though they are supposed to be observers only, Nick and Charlie think otherwise.

The two detectives ways of doing things clash with the japanese poilce, especially their assigned escort Masahiro played by Ken Takakura. If anything his real purpose is to make sure they stay out of their police departments way. Nick and Charlie are quickly aware of this. Nick and Masahiro really do not get along. Nick and Masahiro do things totally opposite so they clash. It makes for good conflict in an already awkward situation.

Charlie is the one who actually tries to get Nick and Masahiro to get along better, which is a difficult task best. As the two detectives get closer to finding Sato, the more trouble they find themselves in. The action really goes up as this happens. Sato has his own plans with them. There's quite a bit of drama in between action points, which I like. You really find out what these 3 characters are all about.

This movie is my favorite cop movie, it just does things much differently. There's some very good action that mixes the drama very well.
The story changes quite alot, it's hard to predict sometimes what will happen as opposed to most others. So this movie should definetly be seen.",1247011200,2,2468,4.651376146788991

I've given it four stars because the multilayered ironies are only fully revealed through the commentary which is reinforced by the other special features.

I remember going to see this film in the theater.

I think it holds up over the years.

Great to look at, well acted.

1 thing I have NEVER liked about it is the Andy Garcia death scene.  Just to look at, not realistic.  For film only.
And, what started this story.  IF Michael & Anthony were in this restaurant WHY DID THEY NOT STOP THE KILLINGS BEFORE THEY HAPPENED?  They were police & had guns.

Still can't figure out little scene at the beginning of the film.  WHY TAKE YOUR KID TO SCHOOL IN THE RAIN ON A MOTORCYCLE?  Can't the kid get sick?

Good extras on this special edition DVD.
BUT, WHY A PLAIN JANE SILVER DVD?  This film was great to look at with both the Japan & New York playing key roles in the film.

Film has the Ridley style.  1 of my favorites of his.

FATAL ATTRACTION

I remember when the film came out. Film goers were talking about it.

Of course, the memorable lines & scenes.

To me it has lost a bit of it's edge over the passage of 21 years.

Well acted by the 3 principles.

1 THING I HAVE ALWAYS HATED ABOUT IT & STILL BOTHERS ME TODAY. What was the deal with the kid Ellen's hair? I THOUGHT IT WAS A GIRL BUT WITH THAT BOYS HAIR CUT? A boy named Ellen?

Some good extras on the DVD. Having the laser disc of the film I had already scene the ""original ending"" to the film.

At the height of Michael's successful film streak in the 1980's. With the purchase of this DVD I now have the 3 roles of Glenn's I like, besides this 1 ""Air Force One"" & ""101 Dalmatians"".

343712,4,6301643410,"Black Rain, of all of Ridley Scott's movies, would also be remembered as that bastard cousin of Blade Runner - at least in its setting.  Referencing his own classic noir style, Scott finds himself shooting in the real town of Osaka, with Douglas playing the devil-may-care, gung-ho, I'm-gonna-kill-that-sonuvab*tch cop on the loose.  Shafts of light through rotating fans and blinds; neon lights in a dripping wet environment; and steam through manholes - Black Rain refers visually to Scott's earlier incarnation, but also feels more like brother Tony Scott's production because of the hard boiled slam-bang action.

Michael Douglas is in his typical 80s tough guy stance in this one, but has a great counterfoil in his Japanese co-stars - good cop Ken Takakura and villain Yusaka Matsuda - along with a few other dour Yakuza actors.  Andy Garcia still looks fresh as the sidekick.  All give great performances, so while the film is hackneyed in its own way - Black Rain is certainly watchable and rises convincingly above potential cliches by characterising the Japanese in a more well rounded way (- a rarity these days with Asian bad guys).

Will you learn anything about Japan here?  Well, just a little.  Douglas doesn't profess to show his Japanese friends that Americans do it better, but that co-operation is the key - and hence the end product feels a bit more genuine and balanced in terms of its portrayal of the East, in spite of the cowboy overtones.  Other flicks to catch in this vein are Rising Sun and of course The Last Samurai. 3 1/2 stars.",1217980800,,1560,4.856603773584905

343716,4,6301643410,"I will spare you the plot details - tons about what happens has already been written.  I'll just tell you if what happens, works.  In this case... it does, and very successfully.

Put a couple of NYC cops, who are far from being your text-book, right-out of the academy-pristine cops (which seems about right for a couple of NYC detectives), and send them to Japan to deliver and then recover a really bad gangster.

This movie was made at the end of the 80's, but the settings, story line and dialogue is perfect even for 2008.  It is an action movie that really has you interested in what is going on and makes you want to get the bad guy, right along with our hero cops.

The pace of the movie is done quite well and Ridley Scott leaves very little on the screen that was unnecessary - even the karaoke bar scene had it's place and was worthwhile.  The sense and feel of the movie is very realistic and believable.  The thugs scare you and the cops are out to get their man - no matter what.  That's what we want in our cops vs. robber movie.

The side plots in this movie work well and never stray from the main action.  The whole - is Michael Douglas's character a bad cop on the take, worked for me and I was interested.  Kate Capshaw's character was well done and her screen time was good, which was edited enough so that you didn't feel they went overboard with her.  The movie does a sweet job by not giving us too much info about the gangsters, and that works quite well for the pacing in the film.

Give Black Rain a look and it will be worth your time.  You'll also understand why movie cops put tv cops to shame, for the most part.  The Blu-Ray was clean and perfect-o.  Exactly what we want out of our hi-def movies.",1203292800,,1730,4.225609756097561
343717,3,6301643410,"I spent the past couple of minutes watching this, thinking that I was going to see the very cute guy - Adam Garcia - from Coyote Ugly. Anything's better than Michael Douglas with a very dodgy haircut. (Very dodgy - it's practically a mullet.) Unfortunately, they share the same surname and the same first initial, but Andy & Adam are two very different people. Both very cute though.

I have to say I'm not Michael Douglas's biggest fan (that would be my mother), but I don't spend every second of his screen time wishing he would go away. I'm not that bad. I can watch him.

The film is mindless entertainment, with an interesting title - I have to say I like the idea of black rain. It's a familiar story - bad guy cop, teamed up with reasonably good guy cop, after a bad guy, thrown into the wrong situation and having to struggle out of it. The wrong situation here is in Japan, where the American cops have no say so in what happens. They have to escort Yasuka Matsuda, playing Sato, (who died not long afterwards), and hand him over to Japanese police. Simple right? Not so. Police officer uniforms no doubt hired from the local fancy dress shop are worn, and Sato is handed straight into the hands of his friendly bad guys. Cue much hysteria when the real cops turn up. Oooops!

The film escalates from here, with rigid cop rules, and an unfamiliar place to try and get the bad guy back in the right hands. Unfortunately, Michael Douglas pretty much plays the same character he played in Basic Instinct, so he's uninteresting in that sense. Andy Garcia was not only refreshing, but probably should have got the lead role. Let what happened to him happen to Michael.

Other reviewers have said this cop movie is very eighties, and very cliched. Yes, that may be so, but have these reviewers watched Lethal Weapon recently? That is the number one eighties movie. But Mel's hair is worse.

Black Rain is surprisingly enough an entertaining movie, not really what I was expecting, but still excellent all the same. Prepare to shed a little tear at Michael behind a wire fence thing.",1196380800,,2085,4.549333333333333

the picture quality for a pre-hd era film is quite simply amazing, you can seen right down to the scuff marks on the biker jacket at the begining, and I'm please to say that compaired to the standard DVD edition the dark areas finally appear clear like they did in the cinema complex all them years ago instead of the mush that was hastly rushed out on DVD in the first place.

343754,4,6301643410,"Ridley Scott's Black Rain is a lavishly mounted but rather hollow affair, transporting all the usual cop movie clich&eacute;s from New York to Japan: New York cops are mavericks who don't like suits; Japanese cops are team players who like karaoke. Stylishly shot, with Tokyo looking like the sets from Blade Runner with extra neon, The Yakuza it ain't despite the presence of the great Takakura Ken (who even cracks what may be his first onscreen smile), and it suffers from some outrageous 80s power ballading and serenading on the soundtrack (""You're so bright you could be a candle/Hold you so tight you could be a handle/Smell so sweet you could be perfume/Swept me off your feet like you were a broom""). But if you lower expectations and aren't looking for anything too demanding it fills the spot and is certainly better than most of Scott's troubled post-Blade Runner, pre-Gladiator films.

If the film is a 3/5, the new collectors edition DVD earns an extra star for an excellent selection of extras - a particularly good commentary from Scott, an excellent hour-long four-part documentary and the release trailer (though none of the teaser trailers are included). It's just a pity that there are no deleted scenes or the alternate ending that was apparently shot. The 2.35:1 widescreen transfer is also particularly good.",1172448000,2,1331,4.995495495495495
343755,4,6301643410,"I saw this film on crappy pan and scan VHS when I was about 12 and I didn't really understand it and I wasn't really up on Ridley Scott's work. As a result, the impact of the film was somewhat lost on me. I was expecting an action film instead of a character drama with lots of police procedure. But now, older and wiser and with a brand new HD-DVD of the movie, I am finally able to appreciate how clever the film is.

The story unfortunately IS riddled with 80s Cop Movie clichs and goes through quite a lot of familiar motions. But if you see past that you'll appreciate the immense atmosphere and mood that Ridley Scott piles on. Simply put, Michael Douglas is Nick Conklin, a bad cop (pretty much the exact same character in Basic Instinct) who drag races on his superbike to pay alimony and pinches drug money instead of turning it in for evidence. Enjoying lunch with partner Charlie (Andy Garcia) in a steakhouse in New York's meat-packing district, they just happen to witness a Yakuza execution by wanted Japanese criminal Sato (Yusaku Matsuda, who was dying of cancer during filming and didn't tell anyone). After a quick punch-up and shoot-out they find themselves chaperoning Sato back to Osaka. But when they arrive there he manages to escape, leaving them embarrassed with lots of questions to answer.

Nick and Charlie find themselves in a very foreign and intolerant world and recapturing Sato proves to be difficult in many ways. Not the least of which is Japan's alienating culture (from an NYPD point of view) and rigid rules. Nonetheless, Nick is determined to catch Sato and restore his honor.

Like I said, the atmosphere of the film is overwhelming, which is really all the film needs. The clichs and stereotypes don't matter so much when you are involved this much. Hans Zimmer (his first film with Ridley Scott) provides a deeply emotional and very melodic score that'll be rattling around in your head for days. It's a shame it's never had a comprehensive CD release, as it's one of Zimmer's most impressive efforts.

You could call it a pretty 80s movies, but I still do feel that it holds up pretty well today. As one of Ridley Scott's more forgotten works, it's well worth checking out.

The HD DVD features a brilliant 2.4:1 1080p image with Dolby 5.1+ and a great retrospecive documentary by Laurent Bouzereau. But why is it split into 3 parts? Totally pointless!

However, Ridley Scott took his approach to this story that if handled by anyone else would have ended up probably like any other 80's action flick. The story follows a renegade cop played by Michael Douglas and his partner played by Andy Garcia as they travel to Japan to deliver a convicted Japanese murderer back to the Japanese police to be imprisoned. When they arrive they are met by the police and hand over the prisoner, but things aren't that easy. The seemingly legit police officers were actually in disguise, and now Nick and Charlie clash with the Japanese culture and with their assigned guide from the Japanese police played by Ken Takakura.

The film follows the formula and if you put your head to it then of course this film will seem unoriginal, but that's not the point. I don't think anyone on the film thought they were creating a masterpiece. Ridley Scott is best known for creating worlds and really utilizing the setting of a film to shape the characters. Here he has Japan, a completely foreign land to most Americans, and he utilizes the setting perfectly. The film is very dark, color-wise. Most of the scenes take place at night and that's where we get the film's really vibrant lighting. Jan De Bont's cinematography really brings notice to the concrete jungle that is Japan and most of the scenes are lit by neon and florescent lights. This adds a harsh dark side to Michael Douglas' character, and that's appropriate since he is a flawed hero. Nick (Douglas) is not a likeable character at all, and that is why Charlie (Andy Garcia) is his partner. Charlie brings humor and charm to the film and the first half of the picture is actually carried on that character. Once we are focused on Douglas's character the film picks up speed and really opens more of his character as he builds a relationship with the Japanese policeman, Matsumoto (Takakura).

Michael Douglas gives his character a rough edge and he closes him up for the first two acts, and not until the third act do we see him start to open up. Douglas does a great job at crafting this flawed character. Andy Garcia is perfect as Douglas's opposite and brings the movie much needed life. Ken Takakura who has not done any American films besides this is great as a supporting character. Our villain is played by Yusaka Matsuda, one of those typical 80's action bad guys who doesn't talk that much and is all about the stare. It's the acting and the characters that makes this film's plot stand out from the rest, because if it were not for the characters then this movie would be forgotten in a month. Yes, Ridley Scott did craft the film into his style, and that did wonders for it, but if he had flat characters then it would be wasted.

VIDEO: The film is presented in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen. I was pretty bothered by the picture unfortunately. This transfer does not handle black well at all. In some scenes you can barely see the actors' faces, and I know that was not intentional from a creative standpoint. Jan De Bont's vivid lighting is brought to life and the neon shines sharply, but the picture overall is very soft. You will notice the blurriness of the picture mostly at the end of the film in the wine vineyard because it takes place during the day. Overall, not to impressed, especially since this is a double-dip.

AUDIO: The sound on the other hand is top notch. The old disc had a Dolby 5.1 mix, but with this new release we have an incredibly dynamic Dolby Digital 5.1 EX mix. The picture is more about the atmosphere than it is about action, but it definitely enriched the viewing experience.

SPECIAL FEATURES: The old release was barebones, and surprisingly I was impressed with what was put together for this release. The bonus features consist of a ""making of"" documentary broken into 4 parts. The first part is about the pre-production of the film and runs for about 28 minutes. They go into the script and how they cast the film, it's great stuff. The production of the film is broken into two sections, a 20 minute part and a 7 minute part. They talk about the problems they had filming in Japan and how it was completely different than filming in America. We hear from the costume designer, the producers, the actors, Jan De Bont and his goals for the look of the film, and of course Ridley. The post production section talks about editing the film, scoring the film, and then the release of the film and public response. Hans Zimmer gets significant screen time and talks about his first film with Ridley Scott which would later lead to an incredible partnership. Zimmer is my idol and it was great watching him discuss this early work of his that would later become the structure for his scores to Batman Begins and The Last Samurai. There is also lots of resemblance to his score to Rain Man, which is how Ridley discovered him.

BOTTOM LINE: The film follows the formula, but Scott brings a new point of view to it and created a memorable, exciting, and entertaining picture. This is not the best film ever made and it's not Scott's best film, but it's a great action film that does everything it sets out to do.",1161475200,16,5233,4.579509071504803

343773,4,6301643410,"As soon as the movie starts you can feel it: this movie is gonna be dark, you can feel the dark atmosphere coming out of your television set. But like a lot of Ridley Scott's films, the darkness makes it great.

The story is an easy one, but very entertaining: two cops capture a japanese criminal in New York and are orderd to take him back to Japan, where things get out of hand. The criminal, named Sato, escapes and Cops Michael Douglas and Andy Garcia are willing to do anything to get him back, although they are not welcome in the for them unknown Japan.

The casting is superb.

Michael Douglas is perfect as the tough cop Nick, who shows that isn't the one to mess with. He acts convincing and was the right choice for the part.

Andy Garcia steals the show as Charlie, Nick's partner. He knows how to bring the character of the ""have a positive look on life"" Charlie to life.

Then there is Kate Capshaw as Joyce, a woman in a club that helps them a hand. She is sexy and acts great. She plays her part convincing and strong.

Although the movie has some great actionsequences, it is all about suspence. It is a great thriller that takes place in the perfect place to set a thriller: the dark underworld of Japan.

The great thing about the film is that although the hard and cold darkness, it has some nice warm scenes of humor that give you a smile on your face.

So if you are looking for a dark action thriller, you are looking at the right movie: Black Rain.",1151798400,5,1473,4.273381294964029

343776,4,6301643410,"Most avid fans remember Ridley Scott from having directed ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"" which are some of the most famous Sci-Fi classics of all times. Black Rain in many ways captures the ""feel"" and atmosphere of ""Blade Runner"" but in a non-futuristic way. The story is set mostly in Japan and combines the local experience from an outsider's point of view along with the seudo-futuristic and seudo-surrealistic sourroundings of the city of Tokyo. The cinematography is excellent just as Blade Runner's and the movie does a great job in making you feel right as if you were part of the premise. The story line is not the deepest but it is original, specially for the genre. It deals with a demi-corrupted cop who after a series of incredible events involving the Japanese mafia and some chases through foreign lands, finds himself in a position to choose right from wrong in order to absolve his troubles. If you love Blade Runner then this movie is a must for you but, if you didn't like Blade Runner, then this movie may not be your cup of tea. Ridley Scott is a very versatile director who created iconic movies such as ""Alien"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Thelma and Louise"" as well as the ever-popular ""Gladiator"". He also has directed other movies that merit mentioning even though they are not necessarily pictures I liked. Movies such as ""1492, The Conquest of Paradise"", ""GI Jane"", ""Kingdom of Heaven"" and (in my opinion) an attrocious sequel to the ""Silence of the Lambs"" simply titled ""Hannibal"". Ridley Scott is a very visual director so the bulk of his movies have at least great photography and art direction. ""Black Rain"" in my mind, is one of his best at that. He also teams up with Michael Douglas and Andy Garcia who are very accomplished actors Douglas has also proven himself to be a good director as well as an excellent producer (having produced ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest""). Kate Kapshaw has a very good performance on this movie in a character that is a far cry from her ""Indiana Jones"" character (although they both hang around nightclubs to earn their living). The bad guy in this movie is a character named Sato (excellently played by Yusaku Matsuda). Unfortunately, Matsuda died later that year from bladder cancer and we never got to see his potential career spand the way that it should had. In all, ""Black Rain"" makes up an excellent example of the Ridley Scott era of ""atmospheric"" cinema and I, for one, recommended highly.",1144195200,2,2449,4.751173708920188

Ladies and gentelmen, in this ""widescreen"" version you get even LESS picture than the FULLSCREEN version.

Now once you get past that fact, ""Black Rain"" is a flawed action/cop flick but with great cinematography. Huge loopholes, flimsy plot points, cop movie cliche after cop movie cliche. But why I love it is because it's the only movie I've seen American, or Japanese that captures the feeling of your first night in Tokyo after flying in (or Osaka as in the case of Black Rain). And Black Rain captures it perfectly. Other more ""important"" movies have tried to capture that essence and failed. Tarantino couldn't get it in KILL BILL.

343778,4,6301643410,"'Black Rain' came out in 1989.  It's shown a lot of legs (it was on HBO last weekend) for two reasons:  first and foremost, it's a Ridley Scott film, nuff said; second, it is - as the amazon reviewer pointed out - a wonderfully guilty pleasure, featuring such delightful absurdities as Kate Capeshaw (Mrs. Steven Spielberg, for god's sake) crammed into some va-va-voom sequined outfit, and sportin' some seriously tousled Big 80s hair.  And speaking of big hair, that's one excellent mullet being chaperoned around by Michael Douglas.  It is, after all, 1989.

I'll put this film in the same category as Philip Kaufman's 'Rising Sun' - 1989 was the height (of absurdity, as it turns out) of the Japanese bubble economy, and Japan-focused films of this age spoke to the fear or at least latent concern about the Japanese economic model eventually besting the US model.  So, in light of a dramatically different Japan circa 2005, 'Black Rain' looks a little over the top.  But, hey, this is a movie, and this is Ridely Scott.  You want subtlety?  Look elsewhere.

The real star of the film (if you can look around Mr. Douglas' most excellent rants and rages) is regal Japanese star Ken Takakura as Detective Masahiro.  His IMDB filmography lists 130 substantial roles in his prolific history and calls him ""the Clint Eastwood of Japan,"" not faint praise in anyone's book.  Mr. Takahura literally holds the film together, acting as the bridge between the Douglas/Garcia side of the film, and the Japanese side of the film.  It's great work.",1105574400,12,1537,4.842911877394636
343799,3,6301643410,"I finally saw this movie yesterday, 15 years after it was released. I had read ""Rising Sun"" and have watched the movie version of it, and was interested in Japanese culture and the perception of the Japanese back in the late 80's and early 90's. So I ordered ""Black Rain"" and though it also addresses Japanese-American cultural differences, has plenty of action and is stylistic, it was kind of a letdown. The movie didn't seem to pick up until Andy Garcia's character got his head lopped off (perhaps not such a bad thing), which was an hour into it. After that I enjoyed it quite a bit, but unfortunately my impression of ""Black Rain"" is not much more than a semi-cheesy 80's buddy cop movie, of which there are so many already. If it's buddy cop flicks you like, ""Rising Sun"" is a far better movie dealing with similar themes and cultural perspectives. If you are interested in these things, then the book by Michael Crichton is even better. Plus, it was a bit difficult for me to be convinced of Michael Douglas's tough-cop role in ""Black Rain"" with that hideous perm he's sporting. Overall, a good movie but there are certainly better ones which are just as entertaining, stylistic, educational, and sexy.",1098921600,3,1210,4.685446009389671
343800,3,6301643410,"Before I review Black Rain, let me tell you that I agree with some of the previous reviewers that the picture quality of this DVD (its better on VHS) is totally unacceptable.  When I first watched it, I had to check my cable connections to make sure they weren't at fault.  What a let-down.  Mr. Scott should be raising hell over this.
With that said, this is one of my favorite action movies.  It portrays Detective Nick Conklin (Michael Douglas) as an outgoing, old-school cop who takes moral short-cuts to get the job done.  His partner, a relatively new Detective (Andy Garcia) is along for the ride.  They have a run-in with a Japanese mobster (Yakuza) named Sato.  After arresting Sato for commiting two murders in a New York restaurant, the Detectives are ordered to escort him back to Japan to face charges there.  They manage to let Sato escape as he arrives in Japan.  A Japanese Detective (Ken Takarara) is assigned to help out the New York Detectives.
Douglas, Garcia and Takarara are excellenty cast in their respective roles.  The screenplay is well written.  I must say that the cinematography is really good.  Japan, the once-conquered nation, is now an industrial powerhouse.  But, like the U.S., it suffers from the ills of corruption and violence.  Ridley Scott does a great job of showing the tension between the two cultures.  The Japanese, ""bound by duty and honor"", and the Americans, loud and outspoken, are viewed as somewhat obnoxious by their counterparts. The musical score is incredible.  Hans Zimmer really brings this movie to life with an array of Japanese and American-themed music that injects just the right amount of tension for the corresponding scene.  Brilliantly done.
This movie is 5-Star material, but the DVD version is a huge disapointment.  I would wait to see if a special edition DVD comes out (I can only hope) with the video quality this movie deserves.",1080691200,30,1902,4.854037267080745
343801,5,6301643410,"I'm not sure why this movie is described as a 'guilty pleasure'. I don't feel at all bad about liking it. And I do like it, a lot.
For one thing, I like Michael Douglas. I liked him thirty years ago in _The Streets of San Francisco_, I liked him even better after he turned _One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest_ from a great book and a great stage play into a great motion picture, and I've kept right on liking him every time he's gotten himself cast in a stylish, well-scripted film.
And this _is_ a stylish, well-scripted film. It's every bit as dark as you expect from Ridley Scott, and although there's a fairly well-defined villain, the 'heroes' are morally ambiguous. I like that in a movie.
The reviewers who say Michael Douglas's character Nick Conklin is an 'ugly American' are right, but they seem to have missed the fact that this is part of the point. This film is a fairly ambitious, though not terribly deep, attempt to bring off an East-meets-West theme in what looks superficially like just another buddy-cop movie. The 'black rain' of the title is one of the aftereffects of the nuking of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and it's the symbolic stand-in for the Western 'decadence' bemoaned by the more traditional Nipponese (even the crime bosses).
But that doesn't mean Japan wins the dramatic argument. On the contrary, the Nipponese cop (played with endearing self-effacement by Ken Takakura) learns a few things from his new cowboy friend 'Nick-san' too. (And the karaoke scene with Takakura and Andy Garcia is priceless.)
Kate Capshaw doesn't really need an excuse to appear in a film, and that's good, because here she doesn't really have one. She's an expatriate American who inexplicably keeps turning up at the center of the action. She gives the film a bit of _Casablanca_-like flavor, but it's more a matter of mood than anything else.
I won't tell you anything about the plot except that it involves the Japanese underworld and that it zips along at a fast clip. Don't look away or you'll miss something.
The whole thing is rendered most atmospherically, with the sort of dark and brooding edge that I like in a film (and at which Ridley Scott excels). In general I'm not the biggest fan of Hans Zimmer's scores, but for the most part he's used pretty effectively here.
This is a first-rate action-adventure thriller, and I don't feel the slightest bit 'guilty' for taking a very great deal of pleasure in it.",1072483200,62,2426,4.710588235294118

Unbelivable performances by Michael Douglas, Andy Garcia and a JAPANESE STAR.
Michael Douglas plays the opitome of an anti-hero.  He's a dirty cop with more skeletons in the closet than the catacombes of Paris.  Yet, he's a loyal friend, an excellent detective, and is willing to improve his faults.
The story...two NYC cops are forced to escort a YAKUZA (Japanese Mafioso) to Japan.  But to no fault of Andy Garcia and Michael Douglas' characters, the mafioso escapes.  Rumors in NYC and Japan run rampant that Michael Douglas took money for the freedom of the Japanese Mafioso.  The two NYC cops stay in Japan to try and help the Japanese police to locate this criminal.  The Japanese, in the classic we can do it better than anyone else mentality, really don't want their help.  They assign a highly respected Japanese Detective to escort the two NYC cops.
Michael Douglas is the Vaquero.  The American COWBOy.  Cocky, stubborn and eternally the tough guy.  The Japanese Detective is the stereotypical Stoic, BY-THE-RUles agent.  In a clash of cultures, the two derive a friendship that is pure.

""Black Rain"" has always been somewhat overlooked because it was not quite as creative as  ""Alien"" or ""Blade Runner"".  But truth is as much as it  might seem like a standard action flick, there is quite a lot of  originality to go around as well.  Michael Douglas (at his best) plays a  tough talking New York Cop who, along with his partner (Andy Garcia) brings  in a mobster from Japan.  They recieve orders to bring him into Japan and  when they do the mobster escapes.  Douglas and Garcia both are determined  to capture him even though the police codes limit them greatly but they use  every way they can to get around them.  One thing I really liked about this  film is that it does not let up just like the Douglas character.  So much  happens where one believes he will let the Japanease police handle it  instead of himself but his determination keeps him going.  Another thing I  liked is that the Douglas character is not exactly a good guy.  He is the  better guy.  In this film he is a foul mouthed and somewhat corrupt cop  that is rather hard to respect at first but as the movie carries on his  character improves gradually.  In the end I accepted him fully as the hero.  The only major flaws in this film are Kate Capshaw's unnecessary role (she  really adds nothing but a bad performance to this great film) and a rather  rediculous (yet amusing) kareoke scene (you'll know it when you see it).
