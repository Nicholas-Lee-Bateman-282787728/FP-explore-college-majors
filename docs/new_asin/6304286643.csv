837035,3,6304286643,"The face looks a little weathery and older, but Roddy Piper, WWF's former world champion, still has a great physique and that nasty temper of his.  In this low budget thriller, Roddy plays a nice guy who sees his girlfriend get killed by a drunk driver, and when he strikes out at the driver, he accidentally kills him.  He is sentenced to two years in prison.  While there, he becomes a boxing/wrestling superstar, and also witnesses two guards kill another inmate.  He escapes and seeks help from his younger devil may care brother.  Meanwhile, the cops and FBI are after him, as is the vile security chief who planned the murder and wants to silence Roddy.

Typical adrenaline fare, with supporting turns by Miles O'Keefe and Alina Hamilton.

It's one of those movies that keeps your interest because you want to see justice done!",1097884800,7,833,4.743055555555555
