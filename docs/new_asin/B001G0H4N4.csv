8303295,5,B001G0H4N4,"Chad Reed is one of those guys who has both the mental toughness and physical toughness to compete in Supercross. He is a defenant champion but what makes Chad Reed a relevant factor is his ability to ride through pain, to come back from obscurity, and to get in the heads of his competition. Without James Stewart racing in 2008 due to injury, it appeared as if Chad Reed would just coast to victory race after race but somebody forgot to tell Kevin Windham. Windham made 2008 an exciting season by capitalizing on Reeds every mistake. Under pressure,  Reed found himself in unfamiliar territory with the combination of bad luck and some uncharacteristical blunders on the track. But that's when you'll see Chad at his best, right when you think things are over, the guy is like Rocky Balboa, he will get up from a knock down. Windham made it tough but Speedy Reed made it count.",1410998400,,880,4.6050955414012735
