Okay I was totally psyched thought ( Bramstockers Dracula ) brought into modern time very cool a nice twist on things, I love stuff like that. Starts off with ( Jonathan Harker ) going to Alucard's castle, nice start. As in the creepy original later on he's held prisioner instead of being a guest and later seeks to escape. However sorry to say what I saw later on made me think WT? it went down hill surprise it is a BUTCHERED version of and slap in the face to the awesome original

Pros O

Cons

Interaction between characters lets say weird their more like robots, it feels forced and with no feeling. I think the actors are cool though

8254160,1,B00143XDZ6,"The cover is very misleading, it almost has you believing there could be some good production value here.
The acting was horrible, the visual effects were embarrassingly bad, the directing was poorly executed, there were no characters that you could connect with, the video looked like it was shot on a cellphone with very visible taped borders on the sides to give it an odd screen ratio. It's set in modern time but yet they tried to act as if it was back in the time era of Dracula; it was very confusing as they would try to talk and behave in both modern and past, as if they couldn't make up their minds as to which era they were in.

There are a couple brief shots of breasts shown and a very disturbing looking scene with a naked Alucard showing full tiny frontal; laughably horrible, you can't un-see that.

They tried very hard to mimic Francis Ford Coppola's version and failed badly. They even got someone to play Dr. Van Helsing who sorta resembled Anthony Hopkins...

The film is dragged out to about 2.5 hours and it's a part of your life you will never get back, be warned. This one is definitely one to steer clear of.",1461024000,3,1135,4.421052631578948

It NOT worth watching and whoever decided to remake this movie shouldn't EVER pick up a camera to make a ""movie"" cause they DON'T know what their doing as far as making a good movie or remake for that matter. This was a total waste of time don't bother to watch this unless you're into very low budget movie's than have at it BUT you'll be very sorry if you do decide to watch this mess.",1456790400,,442,4.151162790697675
