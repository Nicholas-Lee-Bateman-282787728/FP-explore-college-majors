Of course, I expected the ""F"" word and a lot of it. That, I can handle. But there is no Christmas feeling to this program and that, I do not appreciate.
The decor is distasteful. I haven't seen such poorly Christmas tree, except at the local 2 Dollar shop. The guests are some kind of creeps- Sharon Osbourne was talking about the size of her breasts and how her husband loves them! Another celebrity chef was so unkept! His hair was greasy and messy...and these guys never wash their hands, but handle food. Yuk!
The soundtrack has absolutely no connection with Christmas.
The only thing that remotely reminds of the festive season is Anthony - the turkey, which Gordon's children raised themselves. Now, as the bird is in the oven, they say goodbye to it! WTF!
The recipes - I couldn't care less about that, after watching this perversion of a Christmas cooking show!",1415491200,,958,4.543352601156069
