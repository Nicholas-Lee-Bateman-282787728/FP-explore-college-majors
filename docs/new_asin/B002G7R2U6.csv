8619819,2,B002G7R2U6,"I had seen the movie 'Spare' in the theaters last year. One of the best Korean movies I've seen. I was overjoyed when I found the DVD available on Amazon. I bought it. The DVD came to my home real fast. Original packaging, sealed. When I played the movie with subtitles, I found that the subtitles were bad. In the theater the subtitles were perfect. I understand a misspelled word once in a while but the subtitles were TOTALLY wrong. I can't enjoy the film. There is no consistency with the written dialogue. The subtitles are totally jibberish.",1248912000,,547,4.591836734693878
