7512683,5,B017RL91JK,"This review was originally written for my website From the Mind of Tatlock. The product was provided for review.

There is a bevy of unseen horror gems out in the wild, some that are many years old. Arrow Video has the means and the potential to find these flicks and bring them forth so we lucky horror fans can finally watch them. That is the entire basis for the American Horror Project. Arrow Video has found three films to bring to Blu-ray, in a stellar package full of extras. The three movies included are Malatestas Carnival of Blood, The Witch Who Came from the Sea, and finally The Premonition. However, the three flicks aren't the best movies around, resulting in some mixed feelings towards this otherwise wonderfully put together collection. Read on to see how each movie fares and what the box set is all about...

Malatesta's Carnival of Blood:

The first movie included in the box set is the absurdly wacky Malatestas Carnival of Blood. It's a convoluted mess of a movie, with randomly strung together scenes featuring a rundown carnival and a bunch of cannibals bordering on being zombies. The plot, which is almost nonexistent, involves a family setting up shop at a carnival to make some money. Unbeknownst to them, the carnival's owner, the creepy Malatesta, houses below the surface a bunch of cannibals. The movie attempts to provide a narrative involving the daughter getting abducted by the leader, but really, though, the movie doesn't have a story.

Malatestas Carnival of Blood's plot when boiled down, is just a bunch of trippy looking set pieces, with scenes stitched together to get you from point A to B. The movie struggles to properly flow, throwing random nonsense your way, hoping to spook up a scare, but sadly fails. Malatestas Carnival of Blood is most certainly a shoestring budget flick, however, the film manages to use that small amount of money effectively to give the viewer an interesting movie to look at, having been shot at a rundown amusement park in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania. The people behind the scenes went to town creating these wonderfully odd and frightening underground systems below the carnival, but even that wasn't enough to save this movie from being anything but a mess.

The Witch Who Came from the Sea:

The next movie is arguably the best of the three included films, much in thanks to a wonderful performance from Millie Perkins, and a story that keeps you interested. Molly (Perkins) is a woman on the edge of psychosis, all thanks to a traumatic past involving her father and the cruel acts he inflicted on her as a child. Molly lives in a fantasy world where she dreams of finding the perfect man, usually someone on TV, as she has an unhealthy obsession with television. She hopes to find someone who will love her, but her traumatic past takes hold and she feels she must bring these TV personalities down from the idolized perfection she has given them.

The Witch Who Came from the Sea employs a plot that skirts the boundaries of reality and make-believe, making the viewer second guess everything that is happening. This is all possible thanks to Millie Perkins' performance, which teeters on the edge of innocence and insanity. It's rare that a film can make you feel empathy for a killer, but Director Matt Cimber does just that. In addition to wonderful acting and directing, the movie also has the added bonus of having the expertise of Dean Cundey (Halloween) as Director of Photography. He, as we already know from his several other amazing films, has a keen eye and his use of anamorphic wide lenses gives the movie a nice wide open look.

The Premonition:

The Premonition is the last movie in the box set and unfortunately, it just doesn't bring home the horror goods. More drama than horror, The Premonition is about a recently released psychiatric patient and her attempts at trying to take her daughter back from having to give her up five years ago. She teams up with the even more crazy Jude (Richard Lynch) and attempts at kidnapping the little girl. The new mother of the child starts having crazy visions involving the crazy mother, which hints at both a paranormal and metaphysical situation, but in the end, the movie is a drama, with a tiny bit of something more otherworldly happening.

I will say this about The Premonition, it has some fantastic acting, with Richard Lynch as the psycho mime stealing the show. Sharon Farrell also does a wonderful job at playing the grief-stricken mother and Ellen Barber looks absolutely stunning in a red dress. It's also a flick that has a mesmerizing score provided by Henry Mollicone. The Premonition uses music as plot device, so having a fantastic composer was a must and Mr. Mollicone passed with flying colours.

Blu-ray Opinion:

The movies might not be the best around, but that doesn't stop Arrow Video from going crazy with special features, some wonderful video, and fantastic audio.

The video for all three movies is a bit rough around the edges, but given the low budget state of these movies, it's completely acceptable and in my opinion, gives each movie a much-needed Grindhouse look and feel that only goes to enhance the viewing experience. According to the included booklet, the movies were in even rougher shape and to present the films in the state you see now, thousands of instances of dirt and debris were removed from the only available prints they could find. The audio fares the same, with a bit of distortion and hiss here and there, especially in The Witch Who Came from the Sea. It's nothing that is terribly awful, as the dialogue comes through nice and clear. Arrow Video has done a stunning job on the restorations and all three directors have given their approval, so you know what you're getting is the best it can be.

The special features for the American Horror Project Vol 1 is to put it bluntly, fantastic. Each disc has a bevy of features, including several interviews with cast and crew. Also, each movie comes with an optional introduction by Stephen Thrower, who provides plenty of information on the movies. This is one person I could sit down and listen to all day.

The biggest positive that comes out of watching the special features for each movie is the greater appreciation you have for the films. I may personally not have liked Malatestas Carnival of Blood, but after watching the interviews with Director Christopher Speeth and crew, I now have a better understanding of the work that went into making it and why it didn't turn out so great. The movie's script ended up being abandoned halfway through, which is never a healthy business practice. Thankfully, you can read the draft script when slapping the disc in a BD-ROM drive.

If you end up liking The Premonition, you'll be happy to see that the disc has the most features on it. There is a nice interview with Director Robert Allen Schnitzer, musician Henry Mollicone, and cinematographer Victor Milt. There also a wonderful archive interview from 2005 with actor Richard Lynch, who was very passionate about all the work he did during his career as an actor. Also included are short films done by Schnitzer, which have nothing to do with the movie, but will provide Schnitzer fans more to watch.

Rounding out the entire package is a nice cardboard sleeve housing the three movies, each coming in their own cases with reversible artwork. In addition to some nice packaging, you have a 60-page booklet to read, which contains a ton of information about the movies.

Verdict:

American Horror Project Vol 1 might not have the best movies around, but the passion that went into restoring the films, and with a mountain of special features to go through, the Blu-ray box set is definitely worth checking out. There will be something for everyone in this set, with my personal fav being The Witch Who Came from the Sea. Why not check it out and see which one you like the best.

7512684,5,B017RL91JK,"All transfers of the three films are gorgeous. Simply put, Arrow cleaned up and polished these films better than anyone before and put them on a dual region blu ray for many to enjoy.

7512685,3,B017RL91JK,"One of the great joys of being a horror fan is that even the most marginal titles offer up a sense of time and place that few other film genres can offer.  They not only reflect the cinematic sensibilities of the era in which they were made, but also its social fears and anxieties filtered through a sieve of pop culture nightmares.  The American Horror Project collects three such under-the-radar films and showcases them with all the pomp and circumstance usually reserved for legit classics like Texas Chainsaw or Night of the Living Dead.

Bear in mind, there are only so many undiscovered horror gems left to polish. In fact, each film in the set stretches the definition of horror to the breaking point; more than a few fans will find them too artistic, inept or obtuse for their tastes altogether.  But for those with an open mind - and an adventurous film collection - Arrow Video's limited edition will expand your horror horizons.

Malatesta's Carnival of Blood (1973) is certainly the most difficult of the group to put into words.  Shot on a shoestring in a run-down Philadelphia fairground, director Christopher Speeth blends everything from performance art to kitschy set design to cannibal gore effects.  The story, what there is of one, centers around nocturnal ghouls who emerge from secret caverns beneath the carnival at the bidding of their mysterious Master.  Malatesta's best moments are of the experimental sort, including the use of rear-projection, an illogical narrative and a discordantly memorable soundtrack.  Whether all of it was intentional or just regional schlock filmmaking at its worst is up for debate.

The Witch Who Came from the Sea  (1976) is a much more confident piece of filmmaking that winds up being just as challenging.  A victim of repressed childhood sexual abuse, Molly (Millie Perkins) begins to disassociate from real world and take out her vengeance on male celebrities, castrating them in a dream state that leaves the viewer questioning where fantasy ends and reality begins.  While sharing some similarities with the rape/revenge cycle of the time, Witch is much more complicated in the deconstruction its main character, brilliantly played by Perkins who shares a few of the same qualities as Norman Bates.  Director Matt Cimber adeptly switches channels between Molly's fragile mental state, her unintended victims, and the tragic abuse that brought them all together.  Watch for some excellent early anamorphic cinematography by Dean Cundey (Halloween, Jurassic Park).

A mentally unbalanced mother's attempt to steal back the daughter she gave up for adoption - even from beyond the grave - is the story behind The Premonition (1976), which had the widest release of all the films presented here.  Richard Lynch (The Sword and the Sorcerer) is a familiar face, playing a co-conspirator in the kidnapping that goes sour, resulting in little Janie missing while her parents debate over the use of paranormal methods to help track her down.  There are echoes of the spiritual debate from Audrey Rose, but here director Robert Allen Schnitzer has no qualms about trying to convince his audience there are untapped forces at work in the universe.  And his film manages to be eerie and technically informative at the same time.

Limited to 3000 copies, Arrow has made sure the set is worth your while.  While none of the transfers are spotless (Witch had no surviving negative to pull from), they're all another example of the company's top-notch 2K work, sharing a cool '70s faded phone-filter appeal.  And the extras, as you might expect are extensive, but not overwhelming (see sidebar for details) with the extra short films and screenplays of particular note, along with a 60-page booklet and newly commissioned artwork.",1456444800,7,3780,5.0923824959481365
7512686,4,B017RL91JK,"American Horror Project: Volume 1 contains, according to press materials, three tales of violence and madness from the 1970s.  The first, Malatestas Carnival of Blood (1973), is set at an atmosphere-rich, run-down fairground. Vena Norris (Janine Carazo) and her parents get jobs at Mr. Malatestas carnival running a midway game booth. But this is no ordinary carny. Its manager, Mr. Blood, is a vampire who needs a constant supply of blood from visitors. Also on hand is a family of cannibals. And in an underground chamber, Malatesta himself performs deranged experiments and runs old horror films. Herve Villechaize makes an appearance five years before taking on the role of Mr. Roarkes assistant Tattoo on TVs Fantasy Island.

The Witch Who Came From the Sea (1976) stars Millie Perkins (The Diary of Ann Frank) as Molly, a young woman who experiences bizarre and violent fantasies. Abused as a child by her alcoholic father, Molly is now a dysfunctional waitress in a local seaside bar off the coast of California who casually picks up muscle men from Venice Beach and takes them home to bed only to mutilate them in an attempt to reconcile the sexual abuse she suffered. Director Matt Cimber combines gruesome images with a dreamlike portrait of a woman spiraling deeper and deeper into psychosis via flashbacks, distorted sound, slow motion, and flash cuts. These touches give the film an art house feel and Perkins intense performance is much more effective than one would expect in an exploitation flick.

The Premonotion (1976) is a tale of psychic terror. After shes released from a mental institution, unstable Andrea (Ellen Barber) is determined to locate the daughter she gave up for adoption years earlier. An old friend shows Andrea a picture hes taken of a local child, who bears an uncanny resemblance to Andrea. Fixating on the girl, Andrea becomes obsessed with reclaiming the child, using whatever means possible. The film relies heavily on ESP and the paranormal rather than traditional straightforward narrative. The horror element arises from a crazed mother resorting to extreme measures to reclaim her child.

Bonus materials on the 6-disc set include three short films by Robert Allen Schnitzer; interview with actor Richard Lynch; brand new interviews with Dean Cundey and John Goff; audio commentary with director/producer Robert Allen Schnitzer, director Matt Cimber, and actress Millie Perkins; production stills gallery; reversible sleeves for each film featuring original and newly-commissioned artwork; and a limited edition 60-page booklet containing new articles on the films.",1455926400,11,2612,5.286746987951807

8740045,3,B017RL91JK,"The Witch Who Came From The Sea - great surrealistic horror movie, terrible and lousy transfer from Arrow, who despite being online fan favourites, are very much hit and miss with their technical presentations. This blu ray of Witch . . . is for me unwatchable and is in most important areas inferior to the Subversive dvd release of many moons ago. Sharpness and realistic colours and details are on display in the high definition presentation, but this film has an expressionistic seedy seaside atmosphere that is not harmed and I would even argue is enhanced by the softer edges and more painterly colours of the dvd. Sharpness and detail are the only areas where the blu ray wins. The Arrow blu ray exhibits constant print damage - it's like watching something by Stan Brakhage, you know, where he scratched and dirtied up film to show in art galleries as abstract art - it's that bad. There have been some ever-so-slightly disappointed reviews of the expensive blu ray, with nevertheless the usual 'never looked so good' (which is BS) recommendations to buy, but no one has stated honestly how constantly and distractingly bad the print damage is, and how it very negatively affects the viewing experience. Compare to the Subversive dvd which looks beautiful and, in comparison, flawless. Sound suffers similarly on the Arrow blu ray with continual background hiss, pops and crackles that do immeasurable harm to one's enjoyment of and immersion in the story - again, compare to the Subversive sound, which is clean and crisp and again beautiful and flawless by comparison. I'll probably keep the over-priced technically sub-par blu ray, in case I need a screen grab for some reason, that is if I can find a frame that doesn't look like it's covered with squiggly dust worms, but if I want to spend an hour and a half with Millie as Molly, then it will be the old Subversive dvd every time. Also, despite some unsubstantiated rumours to the contrary, the Subversive dvd is completely uncut, clocking in at 1:27:39.",1490054400,,2019,4.855072463768116

8740049,5,B017RL91JK,"*I received a review copy of this collection in exchange for an honest review

It seems as if the fine folks at Arrow Video and MVD Distribution keep trying to one up themselves.  Every title they release seems to be better than the last.  Some of these classics are well known, while others have been swimming in purgatory for so long that many people have forgotten about them.  The AMERICAN HORROR PROJECT is Arrow and MVDs attempt to preserve some of these rare gems for future generations to enjoy.  And I have to tell you:  they have found some way, way out there titles to start us off with!

This is certainly not a negative, either.  I will confess I had never heard of any of these films prior to receiving them in this collection.  But Im sure glad I got the opportunity to watch them; they are an interesting glimpse into old-school, low-budget horror that every fan of the genre should experience.

Theres so much to like about this collection:  the artwork, the Special Features, and, of course, the films themselves.  I cant wait to see what Volume 2 will bring, but for now we can feast on these three treasures from the 70s.

Each film has its merits and downfalls, but all three are entertaining in their own ways.  MALATESTAS CARNIVAL OF BLOOD is very low-budget, and the acting is not good at allbut the film has quite a bit of gore, and it looks good for the most part.  THE WITCH WHO CAME FROM THE SEA has a very misleading titlebut the story is engrossing and disturbing.  THE PREMONITION is just plain oddbut it is fun, regardless.

These films look dated (and obviously, they are), yet the HD transfer for each looks excellent.  There are a few grainy spots evident in each, but that cannot be helped, given the state of the source material.  The sound quality is also very good.  I had no trouble understanding any of the dialogue, and the ambient sound is decent.

My favorite film of the three has to be THE WITCH WHO CAME FROM THE SEA.  While not traditional horror (its more of a thriller with some horrific elements), the mystery of the plot kept me enthralled.  As the movie concluded, I couldn't tell if what I had just witnessed was a fever dream, or if it actually happened (from the characters point of view).  This ambiguity stayed with me, for some reason, and the resulting consideration left me pleased.

AMERICAN HORROR PROJECT, VOLUME 1 is a huge win for me, and I cannot wait to see what comes next.",1458604800,,2442,4.507972665148063
8740050,5,B017RL91JK,"Arrow Video, the Gods of Cult film, have just released their first collection in hopefully a long line of little known American Horror films - The American Horror Project: Volume 1. Focusing on the mid-70's, this collection of three rarely seen, fairly low budget treats will surely pique the interest of those who think they've seen everything. I would consider myself one of these people and I had only heard of one of the films in this collection before reading about it.

The first film, Malatesta's Carnival of Blood (1973), is definitely the lowest budget (and most inept) film in the collection. The story makes little sense so I'll keep it brief. Family gets swindled into buying a carnival which is inhabited by cannibalistic ghouls. One sentence. Wow, I'm good. Featuring the unmistakable Herve Villechaize just one year before starring in the James Bond film The Man with the Golden Gun, this film had no one else I had ever heard of...or so I thought. Reading through the cast after watching this film I was dumbfounded when I realized that Lenny Baker, the star of the brilliant Next Stop, Greenwich Village was in it (in Gypsy drag). Also, as Malatesta himself, we have Daniel Dietrich whose other two film credits just happen to be two of my favorite films (Dawn of the Dead and Andy Milligan's Fleshpot on 42nd Street). Hmm. Maybe I didn't give this film a fair shake. Calling this film low budget is actually an understatement. The cast seem like inpatients putting on a show at the mental ward, where the first take is always used. That being said, I get a real hard on over bad, regional, 70's horror films. And though there were parts that made paint drying seem fast paced, following the characters through an old abandoned amusement park was actually eye candy to me (I get a hard on over abandoned amusement parks. Hell, I get hard ons over a lot of things). I think by now you get the gist of whether this film will work for you. It's really bad, but bad enough to be entertaining.

The next film, The Premonition (1976), was the one I was most interested in before watching, based solely on the second billing of one of my favorite character actors, Richard Lynch. Lynch has played everything from a sword wielding villain (The Barbarians...oh and Sword and the Sorcerer...oh and Deathsport), a biker (Ninth Configuration), an inmate who tries to rape Al Pacino (Scarecrows), a Russian terrorist (Invasion USA), a hermaphroditic alien (God Told Me To)...Christ this guy has done everything! Well, in this film he plays a circus performer who, along with his crazy girlfriend, try to kidnap her daughter from the child's adopted parents. Oh and a few of the characters have metaphysical powers, which make weird stuff happen. Though the film takes a while to really get going (first half hour), the rest is an interesting take on the supernatural and though hardly a real horror film, its very watchable and original.

Lastly, we have what I would call the best of the bunch - The Witch Who Came from the Sea (1976). Starring Millie Perkins (The Diary of Anne Frank) as a loving aunt who tells her nephews fantastic stories about their grandfather, a brave sea captain. What we soon find out is that Millie's stories aren't what they seem and after being abused as a child, she has been left with a damaged psyche (and a drinking problem). Fantasies start becoming reality and soon the police are on the hunt for someone killing men in sick and perverted ways. Perkins is fantastic as the batshit crazy Aunt Molly and the film itself is also quite original. I'd say its a horror film in the way that Taxi Driver and Driller Killer were, more than Halloween or Nightmare on Elm Street. My only complaint about this film is that it was marketed to be something very different than it is (which made this the film I was initially the least interested in), but it turned out to be excellent.

Though these films may not all particularly be classics in their own right, they make for a very interesting collection. For those who think they've seen it all, this will show a very different side of underground US horror film making that many aren't familiar with. What really makes this collection interesting is how varied the films are - from a low budget, gore filled romp to a rather straight forward, supernatural film to a shocking, psychological character study. Of course since this is coming from Arrow, the set features an unbelievable amount of extra features and quality all around. I really can't wait to see what Volume 2 brings.

8740051,3,B017RL91JK,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Ive sung the praises for Arrow Video for months now. They always seem to be looking to provide movie lovers with something different, with movies that have been looked over or tossed out on the cheapest formats possible. While there is some joy in discovering little known or little seen movies on DVD that have gone through umpteen transfers to the point where the snow and tracking issues almost become part of the film to find them given a decent transfer is enough to bring joy to the most jaded fan. To give them a transfer thats been cleaned and put on blu-ray is amazing. Now take three of those films and put them in one box set and you have something mind boggling for fans of the genre.

Hold on though, that doesnt mean that these films are all great movies and should be seen immediately. But the fact is that so many movies have been lost over the decades and now there is a chance to save many of them. Arrow is one of several companies thats at the forefront of doing just that. Not only are they saving these films but they are presenting them with extras that would otherwise never have been bothered with at lesser companies. And at more affordable prices than some of the others doing this same thing.

So that leads us to this latest release, AMERICAN HORROR PROJECT VOLUME 1. This box set brings together three overlooked films for a time when horror was not a genre seen at the local multiplex on a regular basis. Rather horror films were shown at drive-ins and grindhouse theaters instead. Sure a few movies made by major studios played those big theaters but those were few and far between. Horror films were the inroad for new directors and writers to make their mark, costing few dollars to make and allowing for more creativity than most major theatrical films where the film maker catered to producers and film studios.

What this box set does is take those three films and allow a new audience to see them in a decent format for the first time. Some were released on those earlier mentioned DVD formats that just slopped a rotten transfer onto disc. Others might have been seen only on ancient VHS tapes. But this time around we have a quality copy of all three.

The first film in the set is MALATESTAS CARNIVAL OF BLOOD. A great title for a mediocre film but one that is filled with originality from start to finish. The odds of finding a film like this today are unlikely and that could be viewed as good or bad depending on what you enjoy. Definitely made on a shoestring budget, the film makers here attempted to make something visually stunning and actually accomplish that at times.

A family consisting of husband, wife and daughter join the carnival in question to work there. It turns out later that we find out their son has gone missing and clues have led them here. Even watching closely some will not realize this until much later in the film. As then movie progresses we discover that the man in charge is actually a vampire, that Malatesta iswell Im not quite sure what he is other than in charge of this collection of oddities which include a group of cannibalistic creatures that live beneath the carnival watching old black and white silent films while eating wayward souls.

As you can probably guess the movie itself isn't the greatest thing ever filmed. And yet I found it interesting enough to keep me watching through the terrible acting and low frills effects. But even these no budget effects proved decent for the time and the amount of money spent. I was reminded more than once of the original TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, a movie that also had a low budget but created tons of atmosphere despite that fact. While this film doesnt come close to what they accomplished it is worth taking a look at. And if you're a fan of Herve Villachaize it offers one of his earliest performances on film.

The second film in the collection is one thats been heralded as a great psychological thriller but what I found to be the weakest of the three films and the least enjoyable to watch. THE WITCH WHO CAME FROM THE SEA features Millie Perkins (who many will remember as the title character in THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK), now an adult and ready to prove it. Perkins stars as Molly, a young woman scarred by her past and abuse at the hands of men her whole life. Molly spends her days watching over her two young nephews while her sisters sews telling them stories of how great their grandfather was, a sailor who disappeared at sea. Before the film ends well discover the truth about her father and how her past has turned her into a killer.

The movie progresses at a snails pace and the revelations as to the cause of Mollys eventual breakdown take forever to get there. It also seems strange that her sister lived in the same house and never quite reacted the same way. Perhaps eventual is the wrong word here. While watching this I felt that she seemed off from the start and was always a bit off. Im reminded of Jack Nicholson in THE SHINING which I thought suffered because of his performance. He seemed mad from the beginning rather than going mad. The same holds true here for me.

I also found the film to be another in a long line of movies where child stars make the decision to disrobe to prove how adult theyve become. Im not offended by nudity but for some reason it seems as if child stars always feel the need to display themselves once they reach an age where they can legally do so. Developing body parts does not an adult make. On top of that while Ive read some reviews that claim Perkins does a fantastic job here I felt her performance was far from it. For me it felt one note and that note was out of it. While watching I kept wondering if she was being medicated while making the film or not.

The third film in this box set is the best of the three. THE PREMONITION takes a parents greatest fear and makes it a reality. It opens with Andrea Fletcher (Ellen Barber) reuniting with a man from her past, Jude (Richard Lynch) a carnival clown who takes pictures of guests to the park. They set down together and he tells her hes found her, the daughter that Andrea had to put up for adoption when she was placed in an insane asylum. Now the two plan to abduct the girl from her adoptive parents and escape.

Andrea goes to see Janie (Danielle Brisebois) as she gets out of school but Janie ignores her and goes to her mother, Sheri (Sharon Farrell). Sheri feels that something is wrong but cant explain it. Janie tells her about the lady and the apprehension mounts for Sheri.

Sheris husband Miles is a professor at a local university who doesnt believe in the supernatural. Hes been assigned to work with Dr. Jeena Kingsly (Chitra Neogy) whose expertise is in parapsychology and clairvoyance. Timing is always wrong in movies and holds true here as Miles begins to be attracted to Jeena as they begin their research.

The plan to kidnap Janie eventually happens but fails. Andrea has gone over the edge again and instead takes a stuffed animal from Janies room. This does nothing to alleviate Sheris fears that something is going to happen and infuriates Jude who has done all he can for Andrea. From here on out things only get more mysterious with Sheri depending on Jeena to help her in finding her daughter.

The movie works on many levels and is one of those horror films where a combination of visual imagery and inborn fears are played on to make a terrifying movie, especially for parents. Of the three films in this set is has the best quality when it comes to film even if it seems like the budget allotted wasn't much. Still this time around we have much better performances than in the other two films and a story thats more mainstream than either previous title.

One thing can be said about die-hard horror fans. Theyre not picky. They don't have to be wowed by over the top CGI effects or in your face jump moments in films to enjoy a film. They get to the root of what makes horror horrific. They know that a story can add more to a horror film than any amount of special effects. Sure they enjoy that as well but its not central to making a film a horror film. Thats what this collection sets out to prove and it does so admirably. Not all three movies will be loved by all viewers but the chances are that youll enjoy them all and find at least one youll want to remember for some time. Add to that the extras that Arrow consistently offers with their releases and you have a package well worth the price for a horror fan. Commentary tracks, interviews with cast and crews, trailers and a booklet that comes with the package are among the highlights to be found here. Fans of horror should at least make the time to see the films included here. And true fans should add this one to their collections.",1458086400,2,8836,4.458539603960396
8740052,5,B017RL91JK,"This is pretty much a must-have for every serious indie horror fan, as it's a foray into what has been going on in the genre in the 1970s away from the classics that everyone knows and treasures, but introduces us into the wild and trippy world of what independent producers and directors had to offer at the time, films that are half forgotten by now, and while they are not perfect due to various reasons - and low budgets is certainly one of them - they do offer an often wilder and weirder alternative to the horror canon and are certainly a great addition to any self-respecting horror collection!",1457308800,,602,4.532110091743119
