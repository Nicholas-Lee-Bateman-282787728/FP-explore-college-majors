2413927,5,B000BCXZUY,"The DVD is basically broken down into three sections; 1) dance-style cardio, 2) standing ballet work, and 3) floor pilates and yoga work.  I don't normally like ""dancey"" stuff as I'm not all that coordinated, but Lisa Wheeler breaks down the steps and builds on them, so I know I'll get it eventually.  One student, Sam, shows modified versions of the steps, and each student makes the workout her own by adding some individual flair, which encourages me to add my own little spice (I love Sam's shoulder shimmies, wish I could do 'em!)  The ballet section doesn't do much for me, but the pilates/yoga section really works my legs.  Over all, this workout is a lot of fun!",1140825600,19,672,4.621848739495798
2413928,5,B000BCXZUY,"The first day I did the cardio, I had a little trouble following it- but the next day it was no problem. I love the cardio matched with the ballet and yoga workouts.  I had been using carmen electra's fit to strip volume 2- and this dvd blows that away. I immediately felt a difference with the ballet workout!  If you have trouble at first, don't give up- it really is a great workout!",1139270400,5,386,4.202702702702703
2413929,4,B000BCXZUY,"There are four workouts on this DVD.  One is a ballet-type lower body, one is yoga/pilates inspired lower body, a 12 minute full body weight workout and a cardio work-out.  I loved the two lower body and the full body weight workouts.  I like the short duration of each.  I almost never do shorter workouts in isolation.  I like doing them together and the short segments mix it up a bit.  I've been having a hard time finding DVDs that focus on the lower body and this has a lot of different exercises and it definitely worked up a sweat.  Jury's out still on whether it produces good results.  I'm suspecting it will.

What I didn't like was the cardio.  This is based on MY personal preferences however.  It is a dance-style cardio workout.  I don't like these because I find them too difficult to follow.  I've never been into dance-style cardio at the gym or at home.  But if you like that kind of workout, you might like this one.  I just find it difficult so I end up not watching and just doing what I want along to the beat and listen to the talk-along as if it was referencing what I am actually doing!

I would definitely recommend this DVD though for the two lower body and the bonus 12 minute full body weight workout.  It'll get a lot of use even if I don't ever use the cardio portion.",1137369600,26,1300,4.283950617283951
2413930,4,B000BCXZUY,"Due to sneaky repackaging, this is an old workout with a new cover, so you may already have it.  However, this is tough and effective.  Done a couple of times a week along with their cardio workout and you'll be in shape in no time.  This killed the first couple of times, but now it's getting better and I am seeing results.  I love the set, the music and the instructor is great.  It's motivating and challenging, but worth the effort.  Get this if you want a tighter butt and if you want your thighs a little leaner.  You'll be glad you did.",1135468800,23,544,4.223300970873787
2413951,5,B000BCXZUY,"The cardio portion of this video took a couple of tries to get down, but after that it is FUN.  The movements are definitely choreographed for the lower body, and you can add your own flair to the routines.  Definitely very effective when you ""squeeze"" when you are supposed to.

The three 12 minute add ons are great as well - very focused.  I love Lisa Wheeler, and would recommend this video to anyone looking for a video that won't kill you, but one that brings results in a more fluid way.",1266624000,,494,4.336956521739131
2413952,3,B000BCXZUY,"*UPDATE*:  I HATE THIS VIDEO!!! ZERO STARS!!

Like many of the other reviewers, the dance moves are really hard to follow.  They also do weird close ups of the performers.  Show me the moves not their faces.  I wouldnt recommend this video for beginners, like myself.  I was expecting something better.",1243036800,,302,4.823529411764706
2413953,1,B000BCXZUY,"one word: worthless. i tried it once and will never use it again.  i recommend any of the Self magazine videos over the Shape magazine videos.

here are my complaints:

1. didn't get a workout.  spent more time replaying scenes trying to figure out foot and body placement. didn't break a sweat.

2. felt like a tool trying to do the moves and learn the steps.  not for the uncoordinated, like myself.  more for a wannabe britney spears background dancers.

3. annoying and overly peppy to the point of embarrassing. let's put it this way: my boyfriend was in the other room as i was ""attempting"" to do the video in the living room and could not contain his laughter hearing some of the strange catch-phrases the instructor kept yelling out.  it was demoralizing and pointless.",1211328000,3,777,4.654411764705882
2413954,2,B000BCXZUY,"I have been doing this work out for some time and it is not that great. It's too dancey I feel like I'm at a ""dance party"" but not in a good way. after I'm done working out my body doesn't feel any of it. Also the instructors motivations with ""you can do it"" and ""great job you"" are a bit annoying. Cindy's work outs are much better if you want something more effective.",1202688000,6,370,4.013513513513513
2413955,4,B000BCXZUY,I'm so not a dancer so it was a bit confusing for me....but I eventually got it down. The leg routines really work me hard...love it!,1200960000,3,133,4.153846153846154
2413956,4,B000BCXZUY,"i really, really like the short workouts. my legs and butt hurt soo badly.  i don't really like the ""dance"" aerobics portion.  i normally love dancing, but this requires you to have had prior knowledge of the routine which is based less on rhythm or dancing, and more on trying to keep from tripping on your own feet.  i only tried the dance part once, though... but, if you want to reshape your lower half, i really recommend this dvd!",1185321600,3,436,4.425
2413957,4,B000BCXZUY,"This video did take a few times of performing it before I was able to get the dance steps right, of course I have two left feet and can be clumsy. It is pretty fast paced, but you do get the hang of it quick. I love it and usually prefer it to my other videos. I especially like the instructor, she's so encouraging and upbeat.",1183075200,,327,3.9696969696969697
2413958,2,B000BCXZUY,"This woman may have a great body, but she cannot teach dancing for anything. In the 35 minute 'cardio dance' portion, dance steps are taught frustratingly fast (and this is from somebody that enjoys dancing!).  It took so long to figure out the steps--which are not your 'typical' exercise or step class steps--that I shut the DVD off and jumped on the treadmill.

The two 15 minute hip and thigh workouts are a little better, but you really need to do them both back-to-back to feel any benefits. I would say this is a good video for anybody thats got LOTS of patience to learn the moves and an alternate workout for the first few times you run the DVD, because you'll get no benefit from the workout while trying to figure out what she's doing.  Save your money!",1175817600,6,764,4.482014388489208
2413959,5,B000BCXZUY,This is a great DVD! It has four different dance segments that are so much fun. Don't get frustrated the first times. The first time I tried the 35 minute cardio I was frustrated because they move between the dance moves quickly but after about the 3rd time I new the dance moves well and I got a better workout because they did not pause between steps. I also love the 12 minute pilates and ballet segments. They are so good for toning. I love the SHAPE videos so much that I now have 4 different DVDs. This has been the only workout that i have done almost everyday for 2 months now.,1172016000,2,585,4.185840707964601
2413960,2,B000BCXZUY,"Don't bother with this DVD unless you already know all the dance moves. They're supposed to teach us how to do the exercises, but on here, the trainer and her very skilled assistants just get right into it. It was hard for me to follow along, because there wasn't any beginning, slow motion  of the steps. Because of the above, it wasn't a very effective workout for me.",1140998400,12,370,4.4411764705882355

8085175,5,B000BCXZUY,"I love this video - but it took awhile. Like other reviewers have said, it's not an easy work out, but it is sooooooo worth it! I have years of experience of doing cardio in my living room (mainly The Firm series) and what makes a good workout is good vocal instruction and good camera work so you can see what  your supposed to be doing. The steps in this video are FUN but they're tough to follow and hard to learn, especially when the camera goes wonky when she's just begun a new move. So Exasperating! It took forEVER for me to get it, but I did. I really like that it's only 30 minutes with the option of the short toning extras. I highly recommend this video and it's companion - Shape: Your Abs and do the schedule they recommend. I haven't used this video on a regular basis for about a year but I am two weeks into a new workout which means I'm doing Shape Your Butt...  for the 3rd time (you switch off - one day Abs next day Butt, next day you rest, then repeat)  and I am already feeling results - my butt and my thighs are feeling firmer! Rapid results are what I need to keep me motivated and this workout delivers!",1434412800,,1130,4.127272727272727
8085176,1,B000BCXZUY,"First, the dvd has two sections:  A cardio section (along with a bonus workout) and two short toning workouts.

The cardio was very difficult to follow.  I am not a dancer and struggle with dance workouts.  I haven't spent enough time to get it down.

The toning workouts were fun but fairly easy.

If it was just the dvd, I would give it three starts.

My biggest issues is that this is a reissue of Make Over Your Butt, Hips and Thighs.  They changed the name and changed th cover but the workout is the same.  (I am not certain which came first).  Now I have both and feel like I was tricked.",1409702400,,595,4.185840707964601
8085177,5,B000BCXZUY,"With this DVD, is easy to follow, precise and real. You will burn calories within a short time. It's incredible!",1390089600,,112,4.65
8085178,2,B000BCXZUY,It did not target exactly what I wanted. Not enough of a workout. The one 12 minute workout is not bad but could use more intense moves,1386979200,,135,4.037037037037037
8085179,2,B000BCXZUY,"This has nice breakdown of different workouts and I liked the idea of each being short enough to do in 20 - 30 minutes. (I have a small child so easier to do shorter workouts more often than getting one big one in)
However I am pretty ok with dance moves but this video is HORRIBLE!!! The person shooting the video ruins the entire thing. They are constantly moving the camera around the room when you are trying to learn the new steps and often focus on the upper bodies of the girls (HELLO you can't see the feet and learn the moves if you are looking at the girls upper bodies!!!).
I loved the moves but overall *** the camera person ruined the whole thing *** it bothers me so much I had to throw it away.
There are much better videos out there.",1385251200,2,749,4.172413793103448
8085180,5,B000BCXZUY,This dvd has 2 different workouts. The dvd arrived on time & is a good lower body workout. It is just a lower body workout & doesn't really have any cardio but overall a good dvd.,1377907200,,179,4.0
8085181,1,B000BCXZUY,"First let me start out by saying, I am a 51 y.o.woman who can party like it's 1999! But this dvd had me so damned
confused! The instructor frustrated me so much, I stopped it midway!! I've NEVER done that with any other exercise
dvd, I've purchased prior! Thank God, I only paid a penny for it or I would've returned it!! I just want to work,
not B.S. Save your money!!",1343952000,,369,4.138888888888889
8085182,5,B000BCXZUY,"I admit I don't use the cardio portion of this DVD, but the strengthening workouts MAKE this video.
I have owned it for over 5 years and still use it several times per week. Lots of variety, no weights needed and great results! Efficient enough to do in the morning before work. Got 15 minutes? Then you can do this. Includes modifications for beginners and challenges for those more advanced. I use the bonus 12 minute total body blitz just as much. It uses dumbells, hits all major muscle groups and is great for maintaining the fit physique. In just 12 minutes!! Perfect start to the day.",1319500800,,591,4.5327102803738315
