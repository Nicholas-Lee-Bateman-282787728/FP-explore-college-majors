8078454,4,B000AGTQ7M,"Herbert  L. Maris (1880-1960) was a Philly corporate lawyer who lent his name and case files to the TV series  LOCK UP. Macdonald Carey portrayed Maris on this half-hour show, with John Doucette playing his detective pal, Lt. Weston. LOCK UP had a 78 episode, two season run from 9/26/59 to 6/17/61.

It's interesting to see a mix of up and coming actors and former stars still keeping busy. For example, the very last broadcast, ""The Case of Nan Havens,"" has Mary Tyler Moore in the title role but she's third billed on the ""also"" list. Jackie Coogan, who found childhood fame in Charlie Chaplin's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-KID/dp/B001GAH9YS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE KID</a>&nbsp;(1921), is just another name in the beach-based chapter entitled ""Society Doctor."" (Coogan's career would soon revive as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-ADDAMS-FAMILY/dp/B000HEZEYG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE ADDAMS FAMILY</a>'s  Uncle Fester.)

Thanks to fine scripts and acting, these shows are all above average in quality. Definitely recommended.
