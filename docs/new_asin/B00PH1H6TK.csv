6798852,5,B00PH1H6TK,"One thing that nobody can accuse The Hunger Games movies of is the sequel trap of making the same movie twice, or three times. Each entry in the canon has expanded the series world, added layers to the characters, and upped the ante for the film to follow it. The third and final book in the trilogy, Mockingjay is the most polarizing of the series. The real consequences and tragedy that the characters face was deemed, by some, to be too dark for young adult fiction, however thats a strong message for younger people: actions have consequences and there is no guarantee of everything being fine in the end.

""The Hunger Games"" series on film surely isn't and has never really been kids stuff. In fact, ""Mockingjay Part 1"" is just about as bleak as you can get with a PG-13 rating. This is the stuff of nightmares, not just because of the anxiety-inducing stuff happening onscreen, but because this is just the kind of thing that could happen any day now in this country.

The film, which contains no recap for newcomers to the franchise, finds Hunger Games Victor Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) in District 13, after finding out her home of District 12 has been completely destroyed by the Capitol. District 13 is a dark, underground world devoid of color and natural light, where all of its residents are required to wear the same gray jumpsuit. Her widowed mother and young sister have been rescued from the devastation that hit their home by childhood friend Gale (Liam Hemsworth.) Katniss learns that her love interest Peeta is alive, but has been sending messages for the Capitol, implying that he may have been compromised. After demanding the release of Peeta and the other captive Victors, Katniss agrees to be the Mockingjay, and the face of the revolution, at the request of President Coin (Julianne Moore, in a gray wig.)

The only problem to face Mockingjay Part 1 lies right there in the title - part one. The film does a great job setting the groundwork for what looks to be a spectacular finale, but might appear to some as a little more slow-moving than the previous installments. Mockingjay is about the same length as the rest of the books, but has a lot more subtext and emotional weight than the two before it.

After seeing Part 1, I became happy (or at least non-infuriated) with greedy Lionsgates decision to split this thing in half. Quiet moments allow the always terrific Jennifer Lawrence and her stellar supporting cast room to breathe. Its a more character-driven film than the previous two, which I found to be a welcome change, especially since Part 2 will be more story driven, given that there is still alot of story to be told.

This is easily the most political Hunger Games movie to date, and its stuffed with nods to times of political turmoil and uprising in the United States. I caught a few references to 9/11, the Civil Rights era, the Occupy protests, and general wartime propaganda. This is also easily the most culturally significant and important film so far in the series. The film also has a biting humor that you probably didn't expect, reminiscent of political comedies like Wag the Dog and HBOs The Newsroom. This is also, rather simply, a story about PTSD. The first scene shows Finnick (Sam Claflin) telling Katniss that he wishes they all died in the conclusion of the Quarter Quell, so that none of this would have ever happened.

The ways in which this film deviated from the novel are all, surprisingly, positive. The role of President Coin is expanded, allowing Julianne Moore more character development. The best parts of the movie, arguably, are Katnisss and Coins rousing speeches to their people. The fan-favorite role of Effie is also expanded, giving the great Elizabeth Banks a little more to do. But no one quite outshines Jennifer Lawrence, whose expressive face can convey so many emotions with a single look. And while she has a few showy dramatic scenes, she never plays anything even a little over the top. Thats the sign of a truly dynamic actress.

So, in conclusion, Mockingjay Part 1 is quieter and talkier than the first two films, but does that hurt it or make it any less satisfying? Absolutely not. Theres substance to spare, and every moment is compelling. Theres loads of tension, emotional heft and fine acting coming from all angles. It cant help but feel like the half-movie it is, but thats all right. The disturbingly chilling final scene will leave you reeling. Same time next year? I know Ill be there.

6798853,5,B00PH1H6TK,"I wasn't so sure about Mockingjay divided on two films, since the book starts slowly before it gets really good. But following the trend of Harry Potter and Twilight, ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1"" was amazing and it surpassed my expectations.
Being a fan that has read the book series, watching this film I found that the story is really loyal to the book, even more loyal than Catching Fire. With slight changes that work out better for film, saving some time smartly, the first part of Mockingjay delivers a psychological and dramatic side of the story, following Katniss finally becoming the Mockingjay everyone wants her to be.
Although the movie lacks the ""physical/action"" strength from the first two films, the movie handles the tension and drama from the book remarkably, without being too superficial but also without being too emotional, all supported by amazing performances by Jennifer Lawrence (this time we see the psychological side of Katniss that was almost absent on the first two films), Julianne Moore as Alma Coin, and the rest of the returning cast.
The movie knows how to keep things interesting, with amazing visuals, and again, and amazing adaptation. Fans will love it, and the ones that didn't read the books will love it as well. It's such a shame that we have to wait another year for the conclusion, but knowing THG, I know it won't dissapoint. Run to the theater! THG: Mockingjay Part 1 might become one of the best movies of the year!",1416528000,7,1474,4.830039525691699

I was a bit taken back with the depiction of society's privileged group as blindly believing what they were told by their governing party, whether out of ignorance or fear, and enjoying the good life to an extreme, was a bit of a stretch for me.  I was also a bit put off by the attire, hair styles and headdresses of the upper crust which from my subjective point of view looked like a never-ending Halloween party gone awry.

Kind of BS.  The 1st movie was great, and so was Jennifer, but they should have stopped there.  Plus, the character never seems to mature from the experiences.  She always freaks out, the exact same way (like she has no experience to it).  Hello?  People start learning to deal with that kind of thing, and i would think a good actor understands that.  Someone going to battle the first time, isn't the same person, when they go the next, and the next.  But she still will over react (over act), in the same way, but wait, then do something out of the blue hero like.  So for me, her character isn't real.  I do like Jennifer, and will always give her a chance, but Katniss should never had been revisited.",1515542400,,875,4.433962264150943

6798897,4,B00PH1H6TK,"The series went from a poignant bothersome allegory of the culture to mass graves. The Hunger Games franchise is a scary caveat for society and an uncomfortable take on the Iraq war and struggles in the Middle Eas.? Aggressive government suppression (ISIS), technological hacking (NSA/Ed Snowden), post-traumatic stress syndrome (military), and media based propaganda (the cover of the newspaper sitting closest to you). As was the first installment in 2012, Mockingjay, part 1 is a powder-keg of intriguing thoughts, yet as with Catching Fire (2013), its hard to fairly judge the saga without all the segments in place.

However, this has not prevented me from enjoying the movies. THG:MP1 is a roaring, if somewhat simplistic take on the uprising of the masses to overthrow their oppressors. All I can say is: about time. Despite a rather shonky script and some dire dialogue its a fairly solid movie that perhaps spends too much time gazing at its navel rather than getting on with the story. This is probably due to the fact that the final book has been split into two movies and the content is spread too thinly. As always the production values are very high and the performances good, even though theres little for some of the cast to do. Its definitely the weakest of the first three movies (there should only be three in total  greedy Hollywood!) but its decent enough.",1503187200,,1011,4.611111111111111

Amazon gives a sample of the first few pages of the book and both the Capitol and District 13 had nuclear missiles set to launch in response to a missile attack.  Neither wanted an area of North America covered with nuclear contamination so they had a cold war and the Capitol denied the existence of 13.

6798959,5,B00PH1H6TK,"""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1"" is a superb movie, which represents the first part of the third installment of the film adaptation of the brilliant trilogy written by author Suzanne Collins. The script of the movie follows the story line of the third novel in the series very closely, and it provides excellent plot and character development. In her leading role, Jennifer Lawrence is absolutely spectacular with her portrayal of the intrepid teen warrior Katniss Everdeen. The entire cast is sensational, and it includes an impressive assemblage of supremely talented actors. In addition to the great script and cast, the set and costumes are also fabulous, and they definitely contribute to the surreal atmosphere of this chilling dystopian tale. ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1"" is a very suspenseful and entertaining movie, and I enjoyed it just as much as the original ""Hunger Games"" film from 2012. ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1"" is outstanding, and it definitely merits a five-star rating, along with a very enthusiastic recommendation.",1494633600,6,1064,5.3017751479289945

It's only available via the terrible VUDU service which is only streaming on the device I wanted to bring it home on. . I wanted to download the film to bring it home where we do not currently have wifi. No go. Supposedly I can download to my phone via the app, but that hasn't worked and we kinda wanted to watch on a screen bigger than 4inches anyway. Really wish I had spent the extra money to buy directly from iTunes.",1494547200,,572,4.256880733944954
6798961,3,B00PH1H6TK,The film tries to go more political in the saga and concentrate on the building of a rebellion and the mechanisms for it that can be ambivalent with regards to tyranny tools. However it is developed quite slowly and the transition stage of this part makes it a bit boring and difficult to get passionate about especially because the Peeta/Katniss drama gets tired.,1493769600,,364,4.7936507936507935

I understand that Collins is making the point that war is terrible and inhuman and that power corrupts but we have enough utterly depressing things in real life, this movie is just too terrible.

At least they didn't attempt many other action scenes. The rest of the movie concerns some interpersonal relationships and some geopolitical intrigue, although it's hard to care too much for the thinly developed characters and the intrigue is not very intriguing. Woody Harrelson is in this movie, apparently because he was in the previous Hunger Games movies and not because he actually plays any useful role.

6799306,4,B00PH1H6TK,While still good the overstuffed final two installments drag out the storyline and the pacing slows as the narrative grows. The main thrusts of Mockingjay Part 1 are (A) introducing Katniss to the armed mobilized resistance while simultaneously reuniting her with her mother and sister (B) developing Katniss into a militarized rebel leader and (C) rescuing Peeta from the Capitol while showing Katniss distress over the two men that she loves and cant decide over. All are handled well but could have been shortened significantly and maintained the same effect.,1484524800,,562,5.2555555555555555
6799307,3,B00PH1H6TK,Thought it was pretty good. I think the problem with me is that the books are so great that the movies really cannot compete.,1484524800,,125,4.25

6799315,2,B00PH1H6TK,This was my least favorite of the books and I felt the same way about the movie. I think it's boring and cliche. I also don't feel they needed two movies to cover the last book. I found that the actions of our heroine were not inline with the character we met in the first two books.,1484524800,,283,3.982456140350877

6799320,4,B00PH1H6TK,The series is a great group of movies. The only problem I had with this one and the Part 2 is that it drags a bit. I think they could have combined the two parts into one movie and that would have made it just as good as the first two movies.,1484524800,,242,3.673076923076923

This is not a stand alone movie as it throws you into the story immediately and if you haven't seen the previous film then you will be lost. That seems obvious but it is important to remember when considering the quality of this one. It's not a fantastic film, but it is part of the story and therefore necessary. It primarily consists of set up and really lacks a solid story arc as it is an installment of the series. Because of this I give it three stars. It really could have been developed better but unfortunately the narrative lacks reward for the viewer beyond continuing the plot.

6799587,4,B00PH1H6TK,"I've seen this series a couple of times plus in the teather, so that's a positive vote, I guess.  The films are far superior to the books, in my opinion.  The books revealed nothing about the interior landscape of the characters.  Actions and decisions seemed arbitrary at times.  But in the films we have some accomplished actors, like Jennifer Hudson, who can convey a lot with just their face, and a screenplay that cares about those elements.  I find the idea of pitting kids against one another to the death repugnant.  But of course that's exactly what all wars do.  These films work pretty well as action movies.  As a political statement they trod a well-worn path: tyranny finally defeated.  But really the story keeps coming back to which of these two doe-eyed boys Katniss will choose.  She teases, encourages, wounds and ignores them both throughout the series.  One, Peeta, eventually turns against her. (They say he was brainwashed, but I think he'd finally had enough of the run around!)  Even then we're held in suspense:  Peeta or Gale?  Who will Katniss end up with?  I finally realized, after repeated viewings, how this romantic triangle was central to these stories.  (The fact that I'm old enough to be these kids grandpa probably also contributed to my missing this.)  But finally I think it's the presence of actors like Hudson, Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Stanley Tucci and Juliane Moore that make this worthy of 4 stars.",1483056000,4,1479,4.899193548387097

In the beginning, it re-buffered every few minutes and I could live with that, but then the picture froze and would go no further.

As a fan of sci-fi movies, I have never been more disinterested by just about every scene in this movie and its sequel.

6800091,3,B00PH1H6TK,"Yeah that's right, said it.

If you just want to sit here and watch Katniss be a wimp and literally a 2 minute long scene of her doing nothing but saying ""President Snow.... President Snow"" then this is the film for you.

But you if you want to be actually entertained there are these things called: good films.

Jennifer Lawrence's acting is more monotone than usual. She acts like... well she doesn't act at all. The director of this film should have realized that she was acting about as well as a statue does.

Josh Hutcherson's role was... to make Katniss be a wimp, complain, and they accomplished by... giving him horrible makeup and making him sound like a whiny little child.

It is sad because not even Phillip Seymore Hoffman (RIP) saved it.

The visual effects are god awful, but that has been a standard of the CGI industry for ages now. 9/10 times every single shot with CGI looked horrible in this film.

I never thought I'd say this but the best part of the dang film was Woody Harrelson. And he is barely even in it.

This is nothing but Young Adult trash, that is so boring and so unoriginal that my 2 year old daughter could think of a better plot.",1480982400,,1167,4.395348837209302

As usual, Katniss Everdeen rises to the occasion which makes this movie worth a peek or two.",1478390400,2,533,5.126436781609195

There was no real objective in this movie.

How can she love one guy and still put her head on another guy.

an exciting movie  filled with adventure and intrigue.  If they're still
running, you'd be better off watching General Hospital  or All My Children.",1477526400,,416,4.602739726027397

6800504,5,B00PH1H6TK,"I did not read the books.  I do read fiction books once in a while.  I just didn't happen to get around to reading these ones.  I'm pretty busy most days.  As far as these movies go.  All four of them.  They are just completely awesome and well done!  Some of the best films I can remember ever seeing.  The first movie is episodic in itself with only foreshadowing of the larger story line.  It definitely stands alone.  As they continue they don't loose any momentum or quality, it explodes into a huge story with many obvious parallels to the world in which we live, but they do it so well that its not even the least bit obnoxious or belligerent.  Right up to the last scene in the last movie these films were perfect, IMHO.  But in the last scene in the last movie, whats up with her baby?  That looks like a fat asian baby in white face makeup.  It definitely doesn't look anything like its two supposed parents.  We (my wife and I) were in awe of these films the entire way through, then we spent the last scene laughing at the likelihood of these two people spawning that baby?  LOL  Oh well.  Nothing is perfect.  All babies are cute, that baby is definitely no exception, but that baby did not look like its supposed parents.  Maybe they adopted it.  That is what I will tell myself.

Usually a director or producer think they know how the book should be told and the butcher the story with their view of what you the author meant. So we see a visual representation of their interpretation that pales by comparison what we have all read and of course our imagination is far better than what we see in the so called movie.  However in the case of The Hunger Games, and I mean all of the movie sequels, they bring to life what was actually written and not some crappie version that leaves you flat.
I mean it, they follow so closely what was written and figured out how to bring that to a stunning visualization on the screen that the viewer is left with no doubts that what is seen IS what the author intended. The whole series is well worth watching and Mocking jay part one is no exception. If you have or haven't read the books then you have not missed anything by watching part 1 you will have seen the full extent of the authors imagined writing brought to life.",1477267200,,1134,4.299065420560748

She recognizes that she is being used as a political pawn, but also knows that she is - and can become - much more. Now, she is not going to become something she isn't; we know that she is a good-natured, genuinely kind person who has been forced to do evil simply to survive.

Why would Katniss be so reluctant to support the rebellion?  Why would Peeta allow himself to be used so (apparently) willingly in the government propaganda machine?  How could Peeta (spoiler alert) try to warn the rebels when he finds out that Katniss is alive and then quickly turn into a brain-washed killer out to do her in?

Hello,

RE: REview of The Hunger Games: Mocking Jay Part 1

I Tried A Few Times just to get into the first 30 minutes. I would get to the same point and sure enough -- snoozing. I tried moving to another point in the movie and it's was like -- snooze (what is up with this movie ). Since I couldn't get through Part 1 I deleted Part 2 without seeing it.

Thank you,

Phillip Seymour Hoffman has a fairly big role, so if you're a fan of his, that might help boost your enjoyment level.  A couple of scenes, including one involving hunting, border a bit on the sappy side.  But there's a fair amount of action scenes too that help move things along.",1476057600,,674,4.545454545454546

The propaganda created by the rebellion is comparable to the promotion of the movie itself. I found that interesting.

6801235,5,B00PH1H6TK,"For the people that thought the movie was ""boring, a franchise that was money greedy, and unnecessary to split into too"", I honestly and wholeheartedly suggest to read the books. If anything, this movie as well as part two was  in an effort to fit as much detail as possible from the final book as possible.  In the final book so much happened where you actually learn the background and the buildup of President Snow, his rise to power and the politics that exist within the Capitol as well as District 13. The main problem that I have with people criticizing this movie especially is that I feel that many want to see an arena where people fight to the death over and over again. NOT THE POINT OF THE SERIES. Instead of looking for the instant violence and brutality that was seen the first two movies with the games take the time to actually understand the setting/ universe of the story and what happens behind scenes. Seriously, before people starts spouting about how unnecessary it was to split into two, I wish that they would read the books and then see how crucial that split was. If thats not a good enough reason to watch this ( for the instant violence individuals) go watch Apocalypto instead. Hope this helps.",1471651200,,1224,4.5590909090909095

Jennifer Lawrence plays a very disturbed and hurt Katniss.  It is a slower movie compared to the others, as this is the part of the book where Katniss is struggling emotionally and trying to heal while coping with the rebel struggle.  It develops to national caos and a lot of action by others.

Movie quality was very good.  No streaming issues with Prime.

There is no Hunger Games element to it, and the battles with the capitol are extremely limited, or in many cases entirely off screen. The source material and the screenwriting are not so good that they can carry a movie that is mostly talking. The cast is very strong, at least, and they are taking it seriously, effort and respect for the material can always be a problem when you have very strong actors in a weak movie (which happens quite often in sci-fi/fantasy).

6801910,5,B00PH1H6TK,"Let me start by saying that I never bought into the hype about ""The Hunger Games"" books, and dismissed them as silly young adult books.  When I was traveling with lots of time to kill, I had read the few reading materials available, and was left with the first Hunger Games book, so decided it read it because I had nothing else to read.  After a chapter or two I realized that I had been totally wrong about the Hunger Games books, and eagerly devoured the rest of the first book, and as soon as I returned from my trip, bought the other two books.  When I finished the third and final book I was so disappointed because I wanted the story to continue on forever!  But then I remembered, there were now MOVIES I could watch!

I was very afraid that the movies wouldn't live up to the books, but thankfully I was wrong. The first Hunger Games movie was incredible, with amazing scenery, action scenes, and costumes.  Unfortunately I didn't love the second and middle movie.  It just seemed like it was trying too hard to top the first movie, instead of concentrating on telling the story.  When it was announced that the third book would be a movie in two parts, I was almost irritated, thinking that it was just a movie studio ploy to extend the commercial success of the movie by making customers wait a year in between the two films.

But, after watching Mockingjay Part 1 and now Part 2, I am very pleased that the third book was split into two final movies.  This movie, Mockingjay Part 1, really focused on telling the story from the book, of the rebellion, and the role Katniss would play in it - sometimes a wonderful experience for her, and sometimes a cruel one. I never thought that Jennifer Lawrence was a particularly great actress, I mean she's cute and can play the ""girl next door"" well, but there are a lot of actresses like that.  But having seen the Hunger Game movies now, I understand that she truly is a great actress, as she had to play a wide range of emotions and experiences in this film, many of them unhappy, depressed, worried, uncertain, and other feelings that aren't just the pretty girl next door.  In short, Mockingjay Part 1 was a great film, and set up the finale of Mockingjay Part 2 wonderfully.",1466899200,,2233,4.446078431372549

The masses have lived this way for some time waiting on one to show up and triumph over that system and lead them in fighting back. For some reason movie plots are 80% this plot nowadays. People are being pointed towards this Messianic concept constantly! It is the story of a Savior that everyone cries out for in the movie theater while rejecting that fact that it has already happened in reality on a Cross outside the walls of Jerusalem.,1464048000,,539,4.56701030927835

But then I'll check with NETFIX to see if they will charge me to watch all of Hunger Games?

6803694,5,B00PH1H6TK,"My daughter is obsessed with this series. She watched Disney movies when she was little, noting that the princesses always had to be rescued and never seemed to be smart enough to get themselves out of their bad situations. Katniss Everdeen turns that dynamic on its head. Not only does she not need to be rescued, but she does the rescuing of others. She is smart enough to outwit the President, and she never passes the opportunity to help a friend.  Through it all, though, the characters are still very human and not infallible. They still make mistakes and question their own judgment.
All in all, there are worse role models for a 10-year-old girl to have.",1462233600,9,662,4.6581196581196584

The plot was a bit flat, and assumes that you've developed a strong connection with the main characters in the previous films. As a standalone, you don't really feel much emotion for the characters. Katniss is mostly serving as an ""uncle sam"" for the resistance, and Pita behaves unrealistically in his concern for Kat nissan. The most moving part was when the hospital went boom. Other than that, it ends at a place where you don't really feel satisfied unless part 2 is watched immediately.",1461801600,,591,4.747572815533981

I thought this was probably the weakest point of the movie, since she has always had great confidence in herself and it seemed, to me, to be unlikely that she would break down to that degree.  After that, however, the movie gave me back the original Katniss and you will want to root for her return to the battle between herself and President Snow.

6804219,3,B00PH1H6TK,"Fans of THE HUNGER GAMES, the books, were delighted when the movies began being made. Fortunately for them they were successful enough that they didn't end with the first film. But that also leads to problems when it comes to the release of the rest of the movies and thats what made this one, the third in the series, so difficult.

A quick update for those who don't know: the Hunger Games were games between combatants, one male and one female, from twelve districts that took place at the Capitol in order to satiate the bloodlust of people and eliminate war. Only young people enter and this year things changed when Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) fall in love and promise to commit suicide together if they aren't both allowed to live. Thus was set in motion not only a love story but a battle of wills between Katniss and the President (Donald Sutherland) who rules with an iron fist.

As the third film opens youll find yourself confused unless youve either just watched the second film or remember it vividly. For myself it took a while to get acclimated and put together the pieces of the second film which I hadnt watched in over 2 years. It would have been nice for an update but the choice was made not to. Oh well. As the film opens Katniss has been saved by the rebels and taken to refuge. There she meets President Coin (Julianne Moore) who informs her of what has been going on.

Katniss has taken on mythic proportions as the champion of the people, the Mockingjay (so named because of the bird mentioned in the first film and the medal she wears of one). Now Coin wants to use Katniss for propaganda purposes to stir up the rest of the country in support of the rebels. A team is put together, a mix of soldiers and press people, to film propos (propaganda films) of Katniss but none ring true. It isn't until she goes out in the field and witnesses the horrors of war and speaks her mind that the best footage is captured.

At the same time TV programming shows Peeta, now a guest of the Capitol, talking about how much Katniss should stop what she is doing and how wonderful the President really is.  Katniss has none of it and realizes Peeta is only saying these things to stay alive. Her request of Coin is that Peeta be dismissed of all charges of treason when all is said and done and that they attempt to rescue him when possible.

The movie isn't a bad movie, really, but by making it a film to set up the last installment it leaves you feeling as if you walked into the middle of something and had to leave before it was over. Little changes from the start to the finish and what we get more than anything here is exposition, information about various characters that we will discover more about in that upcoming chapter but get acquainted with here.

The end result is a movie that has a few moments of action and forward motion but more often than not is a bit dull and tedious. Yes, its great that we get to know these characters, its great that we get to know whats coming up. But did they really have to split this into two movies? It would seem that it would have made a much better single film that crammed all of the information of both into a movie slightly over 2 hours long. But by splitting it into 2 they get to sell twice as many tickets and draw it out just a while longer. That seems to be the thing these days between the same format used in both the TWILIGHT and INSURGENT movies.

I doubt that fans will be disappointed here but perhaps the best thing to do when watching these movies now is to watch them all together at the same time. It will mean less confusion and a more straightforward viewing experience for those watching. While not a bad movie it leaves you wishing the next one were here and ready to be watched.",1459814400,,3811,4.38048090523338
6804220,4,B00PH1H6TK,"I was surprised by the excellent fidelity of the first Hunger Games movie to the book. A very good film. I was astonished that Catching Fire was even better than the original Hunger Games movieon par with the book of the same namea remarkable achievement, and an excellent film. While I found the first installment of Mockingjay to be the ""least excellent"" of the three movies, it's still an extremely good movie. It held true to the book, to the high standard set by the first two movies, and to the overall story arc, pacing, and suspense established by the first two movies. As a sequel book-ended by at least one prior film and a climactic finish, it's one of the best I've ever seen  up there with The Two Towers (in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy) and better then Star Wars Episode II,  as well as Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, IMHO. I'm not a fan of hearing about the plot of a film prior to seeing it.  Rather, I simply want to know IF I should see it.  With the above in mind, I highly recommend both this movie and the entire series.  I also highly recommend reading the three books. In this rare case,  reading the books before, during or after seeing the movies  should not diminish the experience of either.",1459814400,,1234,4.385964912280702

The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 or Part 2.  The original The Hunger Games movie could be called an action movie.  Catching Fire and after are more drama movies.

Reminiscent of parts 2 & 3 of the Lord of the Rings and Star Wars episodes two and three, the heroine, Katniss, mainly whimpers and snivels through the movie. The first two movies shows us a strong Katniss that we never see in this movie, except for a few brief moments before and after President Snow orders an attack on one of the districts. Other than that, the leader of the uprising takes a backseat to President Snow and the rest of the cast.

Enough happens that it probably did warrant its own movie, but it will most likely be the least popular out of the series when it's all said and done.  The performances by cast are strong as usual, with A+ special effects and production quality.  I wish I could say that the series gets better as it draws to a close, but unfortunately Katniss' mission to take down President Snow and the Capitol aren't nearly as exciting as the actual tournaments in the first two movies.  It's not that Mockingjay is bad.... it's just that The Hunger Games and Catching Fire were that good!  Having this movie free to stream on Prime makes it a no-brainer to watch, just keep your expectations in check when you take your final trip to Panem.",1459209600,,863,4.541935483870968

6804634,5,B00PH1H6TK,"Her trusted friends not alongside her, 'Katniss' feels isolated with no-one around her she believes she can trust.
Those she finds herself with seek to overthrow the ruling body led by the ruthless 'President Snow' (Donald Sutherland)
the leaders of the revolution 'President Alma Coin' (Julianne Moore) and 'Plutarch Heavensbee' (Philip Seymour Hoffman)
The group are in need of a figurehead to rally the Districts together, someone who already commands the respect of all,
they believe 'Katniss Everdeen' is that person, they want her to become the Mockingjay.
'Katniss' doesn't see herself in such a role, all she wants, is to know that her family are alive and well.....
She soon becomes aware that President Snow has vengeful intent upon her and her family, he has the need to neutralize
the threat to the establishments rule the rebellion poses.
'Katniss' reluctantly agree's to be what she is being asked to be after seeing her close friend she thought lost 'Peeta' (Josh
Hutcherson) pleading on the network for those of the rebellion to stand down, has he been brainwashed, tortured perhaps, or
has he really aligned himself with the Establishment.............'Katniss' has conditions that have to be agreed to if she is to
become the Mockingjay.
To Rally the Districts she has to be filmed as the Mockingjay and be seen and heard by the many, both in person and on
screen, the latter of course will also be seen by the Establishment making her even more of a target.
'President Snow' will reign terror down on those who rally behind the Mockingjay.
Another superb part of the Hunger Games series, this part one of two, the movie moguls certainly know how to milk a franchise,
big-bucks to be earned............can't believe we have to wait so long for the concluding sequel.
The story has developed well after the groundwork of the first two films in the series, in this there are battle sequences and its
consequences along with plenty of tension setting the stage for the final confrontation.
Superb picture and sound quality throughout.

It had some very emotional parts, but other parts I had problems connecting with.  For full disclosure, I feel I should add, that I was on the hopefully endside of a migraine, and that could have hinder my enjoyment of this movie.

6804649,3,B00PH1H6TK,"While the Blu Ray video is excellent, the audio dropped out periodically as there was no English audio alternative to the Dolby TrueHD Atmos mix except for headphone and 2 channel options. Spanish dub includes a 5.1 mix.

My Yamaha RX-A3000 and my Oppo DBP-95 decode every audio format on blu ray except Atmos. Why Lionsgate is releasing this without DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 or even 5.1, or pre-Atmos Dolby 7.1 or 5.1 option for compatibility with non-Atmos systems is surprising and disappointing. I'm not interested in getting Atmos in my high-end system, and expect blu-ray audio to be compatible.

The Amazon.com description as of the date of this review does NOT point out the limited audio options so beware and check if it will be compatible with your system. Lionsgate has the audio options listed in fine print on back so read closely.

I consider audio at least half of the viewing experience and therefore give this 2.5 of 5 stars (rounding to 3).",1458345600,,958,4.793939393939394
6804650,5,B00PH1H6TK,"Mockingjay Part 1 sees the Hunger Games series move from being focused mainly on the Games themselves and into a new direction where the Games are just one of the subplots.  It moves into the territory of full rebellion against the corrupt capitol and government.  It begins with Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence)'s arrival in the supposedly lifeless District 13.  Mostly bombed into oblivion during the last uprising 75 years ago, the district has seen a secretive underground society build itself up over the decades, preparing for an eventual rematch with the capitol's forces.  With the events at the conclusion of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire having sparked riots and minor rebellions in several of the districts, the leaders of District 13 now hope Katniss will help them to fan the flames in am all-out, all-districts revolution.  She agrees to join, but is still torn by concern for several co-participants in the last Games who are being held captive in the capitol.

Like its predecessors, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 succeeds in taking a premise and ideas that at face value may seem a little far out, and making them very believable and real-feeling.  All the trademarks of the series are here: great characters played by great performers, a strong and very distinct visual look for the future world, high drama, exciting and fearsome action scenes, the whole works.  There are some unexpected developments and twists and despite the absence of the titular Hunger Games, this one is just as great as the first two.",1458345600,,1531,5.0

It is uninspiring and unconvincing and slow to the point of being boring.  I know that Katniss is severely wounded psychologically from her experiences in the Hunger Games, but the actress' portrayal is annoyingly whiney rather than moving.  Her brief moments of ""fire"" are uninspiring.  You would have to be pretty desperate for a leader to follow that one.  The few action scenes are unsuspenseful.  I kept wondering when something was really going to happen.  In all, I didn't enter into the story or connect with any of the characters as I do with a good movie.  I know it is only the first half of the last book, but I won't be wasting my time on part two (especially since I already know the ending).",1458172800,,905,4.50920245398773

Very little happens to the characters beyond this overly exaggerated strain between Katniss and Peeta. I wish I was 12 again so I could forget how people actually act in favor of how people act in this fantasy universe.

Slow and plodding for it's second part, which I can't imagine why this needed two parts to tell this story. There was so much filler here that just wasn't interesting.

6805419,5,B00PH1H6TK,"Loved it. Another great continuation of the Hunger Games Trilogy and I could watch them all over and over again. The Modkingjay picks up and tells what happens after the Quarter Quell games and though it ended way too soon, and leaves you anxiously waiting for part two, I really enjoyed every minute of this part one. I saw all the movies first, then read the books and now went back and watched the movies again. The books really help give more detail about what is being though and explains some things that the movies cannot really capture, but after reading the books, the movies are so much richer. Still, whether you read the books or not, the movie is well acted and moves the story along very well, holding my interest. If you love the Hunger Games or dystopia type stories, you'll love this one.",1456704000,,805,4.52054794520548

6805683,3,B00PH1H6TK,"This is definitely not as good as the movies that came before it.  Its more like the middle movie of a trilogy, the one you like the least as its mostly a set-up for the last movie.  But then, even ""The Empire Strikes Back"" had more going for it as a middle movie than this one did as the first part of two.

This movie is basically a set-up for the second half, Mockingjay Part 2.  Yet they still could have done so much more with it...and didn't.  The movie dragged a lot and our heroine wasn't really the center of much of anything save the burgeoning propaganda led by the leaders of Section 13 in order to get the rest of the Sections to rise up against the Capitol.  The scenes were she took action seemed very staged, because they were--both by the characters in the movie and by the makers of the movie.  Okay, let's get the audience and Kat to care, so we will have her visit a hospital and them the bad guys will aim to bomb the hospital.  Let's have Kat go after her sister right before a bombing raid.  Let's have her standing by looking worried as the good guys try and rescue people she cares about from the Capitol.

Let's make sure she looks good in her Mockingjay outfit, has super-special arrows, and doesn't wear too much makeup.

This should have been a rousing movie that leads us into the next movie by building on our caring for Kat and her world and on the growing personal conflict between her and President Snow.  I can see that they tried, but it just fell flat more often than not.  It was an okay movie for what it was, but it could have and should have been so much more.  Instead, it was more a stand around talking about action rather than a take action movie.  This doesn't mean that I'm not looking forward to the next movie, but maybe they should have skipped this one entirely and just added the necessary bits to the last movie and made it a half hour longer.  That's about all it would have taken.

Jennifer Lawrence is still good and I enjoyed Julianne Moore as the leader of Section 13.  But there was just no fire here...",1455840000,,2062,4.25706940874036

6805963,5,B00PH1H6TK,"I probably would not have opted to go to the theater to watch this particular series of movies, but our daughter-in-law read the books and enjoyed the books so much that, when she and our son wanted to see the first installment in the series, our whole family went. Well, it was an intriguing movie and we were hooked as far as seeing the rest of the films. So in preparation of watching the last installment (Mockingjay Part 2), it was imperative that we saw Mockingjay Part 1 again) (which is actually the third installment in the series). As it turned out, I saw the last movie BEFORE getting a chance to see Part 1 due to a father-daughter outing. But my wife had not seen Part 2 yet, so when we saw that the movie could be viewed without cost with our Amazon Prime, we watched it. Thus this review on Amazon.

This third installment (Mockingjay Part 1) is as good as any of the other movies, including the last one. I think it would have helped me greatly to have seen Part 1 a few days or weeks before seeing Part 2. However, having viewed it AFTER seeing part 2 put a lot of pieces together and made the whole 2 part set even more enjoyable and understandable.

I think the entire Hunger Games series is consistent and coherent from film to film and the story makes sense. The acting is good; no actor grated on my nerves. And this is a story that both my wife and I agreed upon, not just one or the other watching it because the other wanted to see it. The films are also clean (no sex, no cursing that I can recall). The actions moves along well, so there is no dragging time. I give it five stars!",1455580800,,1607,4.231270358306189

6805998,5,B00PH1H6TK,"I have always been a fan of The Hunger Games trilogy, We continue from the previous film ( Catching Fire ) to Katniss deciding wether to become the face of the rebellion against the Capital or not, along the way, she struggles with her decision because of the demons that have consumed her nights of sleep due to her previous interactions in the games and her desires to be the young girl from District Twelve. All of the previous cast members are back in this film, but we are introduced to new members Capital escapees: Cressida, her assistant Messalla, cameramen and brothers Pollux and Castor, and other characters who's names I can't think of. They follow Katniss on her journey to becoming The Mockingjay, and long the way, intentions between characters run high as its discovered that one of their people has been captured by The Capital, as they see this characters deterioration in front of them they start to question each other's loyalty. (The special effects that were used to depict the deterioration of this beloved character, were in my opinion, stunning,) this person's mind has also been altered in ways that will effect one's relationships with not only all of the characters, but specifically, Katniss Everdeen in the last installment The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2.

The only problem that I have with this film is how slow it started, (for other fans there wasn't a lot of action, which is fine for me, which is what a lot of fans were expecting)  I felt as though the director could have picked up the pace, I felt like I was watching the film Twilight: Breaking Dawn Part 1, while watching this, ( if you've seen the Twilight film that referred to then you'll understand..lol ) which isn't the way that anyone should feel about a film. LOL.. I haven't seen the second part of mockingjay yet, hopefully I don't get that same feeling. Hopefully my first review of a film helps at least one person understand what the film might be about.

I had high hopes for this being the best of the three, but I thought the last quarter of the film undid almost all the good the first 3/4 had done, once again turning these more general social ills into a totally personal struggle. I am happy for Jennifer Lawrence to be making so much money, but I fear this series may have ruined a fine actress for life. The thing is that it's not a bad setup for significant science fiction but in the end it always turns the issues into pablum by trivializing them as family loyalty or romance.",1454976000,,604,4.2155172413793105

6806087,1,B00PH1H6TK,"The movie can't make up for the source material, which features a significant number of under-developed, one dimensional characters and a contrived plot line, but the acting doesn't help.  While Jennifer Lawrence has certainly shown that she can act well, she's fairly wooden as the protagonist in this series.  Harrelson, Banks, Moore and Hoffman turn in fair performances - but they're all typecast and their roles are highly similar to work they've done before.

The source material itself depicts a bleak dystopian future with exaggerated social dynamics and themes. Indeed, the emotional drama is over-amped well beyond the norm for a dystopian future.  (Apparently this is a trend in young adult fiction right now.)

While I'm sure this movie is gospel to the 12-13 year female demographic, overall, it's neither entertaining, nor is it meaningful social commentary.  As a result, it's a waste of time for anyone outside it's narrow target demographic.  If you find yourself dragged into this - medicate accordingly before hand.",1454976000,2,1034,5.2682926829268295

The first Mockingjay movie has about 40 minutes of content strung out over 120 minutes.
Every scene drags longer than it should.

The biggest example, (what drove me to turn it off) was when Katniss finally has a moving experience and gives a decent speech. Right after the two minute speech, they show the whole two minute speech again with people watching it. Showing this speech twice is really poor filmmaking. The whole movie is filled with this stuff. Doing things multiple times, that only needed to be shown once.

Besides that, the plot goes nowhere. And Katniss no longer feels like a hero, just someone being used.
The first two movies were fun. This one is garbage.",1454716800,17,750,4.753846153846154

I am not a science fiction fan but occasionally there is something that I like and this series is one of them.  This movie series doesn't depend on big explosions to tell the story.  That's one thing I like about it.  Another is the acting.  The characters are well developed and I am very happy I am watching this series.  First rate story, acting, directing, etc.  There should be an academy award for movie series.  I feel this series would win mainly because of the consistent quality  of all parts of the movie making craft on display in all of the films so far. (I can't speak for part 2 as I haven't seen it yet.)  Outstanding movie and series.",1454371200,,803,4.089743589743589

It is, of course, since the 4th movie with have the big finishes to the storylines.  In this movie, we see a different Katniss, one who is extremely traumatized by what she went through in movie #2.  She manages to rally, but her mental state is pretty shaky at times - she's had about as much as she can take, and it gets to her when she has time to sit and think about it.  In the battle scenes, of course, she kicks azz, which is fun to watch.  I'm not crazy about Julianne Moore in this roll, as I'm not a big fan of her in general, and she's just kind of blah in this film; she alternates between creepy and blah.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman is a great actor, but I didn't much like his role in this movie.  The tech expert for the rebels didn't do anything for me either, but luckily, there are a couple interesting new characters, one of the other Games victors emerges as a more prominent character, and of course, there's Haymitch to round things out.  There were a couple major moments of victory for the rebels that made me cheer out loud, and one didn't even include Katniss.  The amazing, crazy, brave assault by the regular folks in the rebellion on The Capitol's resources was superb!  I was surprised at the end of the previous movie, to find out there was a complex underground movement in operation, but even more surprised to see how much extensive the rebels' resources actually are, as we see in this movie.  Overall, it was enjoyable, and I am going to watch it again, to pick up whatever I may have missed the first time.",1453766400,,1718,4.38801261829653

Jennifer Lawrence is believable as Katniss Everdeen and the rest of the cast follows suit showcasing their talents as the amazing actors and actresses that they are. Part 1 engages you in the necessity for the impending revolution that The Hunger Games series has led us to. There is definitely a stark brutality that mirrors our own systems of government and, if left unchecked, could definitely lead us down this path.

I also am assuming with others that splitting the novel into 2 parts was to blame for that. Too much useless time filler to make up for lack of action and meaningful content.

6807519,5,B00PH1H6TK,"It's no mystery that I am a fan of The Hunger Games. I keep a blog (though I post rarely) about observations from the books and the movies (not a news blog, but an intelligent analysis of the stories) and converse about the series regularly. Anybody who knows me knows that I'm a fan, so I'm going into this review biased.

Anyone who knows me well enough to know my opinions on the series also knows that I feel that Mockingjay (the novel) lost me. The series fell apart with this book, and I was disappointed in the conclusions of the novel, and in particular in the final scenes of the book. It was with some trepidation that I attended Mockingjay Part 1 in the cinema, expecting a rather disastrous fall to a great series.

Unlike the books, in which the first two books were phenomenal and the final book lost the momentum of the first two, the movies work in an opposite fashion, with the initial movie being somewhat slow moving (after all, the books allow for inner dialog that the movie does not), the second movie being excellent (rather like the book, in my opinion!) and now, with Mockingjay, the movies being OUTSTANDING.

Jennifer Lawrence captures Katniss with such grace and skill, especially during this particularly trying period of Katniss's life. I was impressed with her performance (and I am not a JLaw fan in general) in this movie. Unlike the two movies before it, this one was packed with action, and it did an excellent job of conveying the emotions of the story as well as the tone of its meaning.

Without a doubt, the best of the four movies in this series.

My only complaint is Julianne Moore. I don't feel that she was the best choice to play Coin, though I doubt that I could have done a better job of casting the film. Admittedly, I find something irritating about her pronunciation of the name Panem.

All in all, however, this movie deserves a five star rating!",1453334400,,1897,4.5321637426900585

6808180,4,B00PH1H6TK,"First off I would add my voice to those who decry the current trend for movie studios to capitalize on a series' popularity by splitting episodes in half as was this one. That said, I can't imagine this movie being cut in half to make a single show 2 hours long. Secondly I would thumb my nose at those who carp about spoilers. Having read the book and knowing the plot lines in no sense takes away from one's enjoyment of this movie else no one would ever bother to go see a live performance of Shakespeare. The show's the thing and seeing how the actors handle themselves is what it's all about. Thirdly I would re-enter the Gale vs Petah debate on the side of Gale. To me Gale is her true soulmate loving Katniss so deeply he is willing to risk his life rescuing his rival to make her happy.

I liked this movie even though nothing much actually happens. I would argue that having read the book is essential to the enjoyment of the show as so much back-story is left out to save time. In the end this movie sets the stage for the battle royal we know is to come in Part 2. Books and movies are two entirely different genres and while books tell, movies show, narration being a stop gap when nothing else will serve. Actors speaking directly to an audience is normally reserved for live theatre.

Although it perhaps runs a little hot and heavy in the teen romance area, this more quiet film is an effective set-up for the series finale.  A major theme of these films has been how the media is used to control people, and now we see how it can also be used to break that control.  Katniss is not interested and not effective as a media spokesman because she is focused on the real pain being experienced by the people, but that very preoccupation with actual suffering provides the authenticity it finally takes for her to break through.  Some viewers have expressed frustration with the lack of a clear resolution, but I don't think we should be surprised that a film with Part 1 in the subtitle ends with a cliffhanger.",1451433600,,966,4.598837209302325

6808275,4,B00PH1H6TK,"This is a solid, if somewhat jumbled first half of the end to the trilogy of books (or third in the quartet of movies) that tell the story of Katniss Everdeen and the Hunger Games. It's not a spoiler to say that it's really important to watch the first two films (or read the first two books) before watching this, since otherwise the entire movie will be incredibly confusing.

{Spoilers follow}

The movie opens with Katniss alive--if not altogether well--in District 13, which had previously been assumed destroyed. When Katniss blew up the arena's force field at the end of ""Catching Fire"" and was airlifted out, she was brought there to light a fire under the rebellion long-desired by the militant District 13. Only some of her fellow victors escaped, specifically the techno-wizard Beattie and the playboy, Finnick; Katniss would then sink into a horrible depression knowing her on/off boyfriend Peeta was left behind to be scavenged by the Capitol's torturers.

As she begins to explore other districts and see first-hand how her small acts of rebellion have turned into flashpoints for attacks by Capitol forces, Katniss begins to assume the role of the ""Mockingjay"" that her handlers desire. Even now, she's still in the Hunger Games--just in a different form and with strings pulled by a different puppet master. She struggles with the weight of it all, wanting to lash out at President Snow for the atrocities he's committed while simultaneously holding herself back in the very real fear that her actions will only spur further retaliation against the imprisoned Peeta.

Of the three books, this one is the toughest, not so much because the arena has expanded to virtually every corner of Panem but also due to the fact that there are so many stories to tell: Katniss and Peeta, Katniss and Gale, Finnick and Annie, Katniss and Panem's President Snow, Katniss and District 13's President Coin...Naturally, some of the stories told in the book are either condensed or written out altogether, but some bright spots remain--particularly Woody Harrelson's Haymitch and Philip Seymour Hoffman's Plutarch. Splitting this into two movies generally makes sense (even though it's unclear that it was done for narrative purposes or to boost box office), but this part of the story is mostly the setup for what comes in the climax (Part 2). As such, there are also some bits and pieces that don't really get shown in the movie that remove some of the flavor from this part of the story. At times, the progression is as grey as the uniforms of District 13.

Still, it's a good film (and improves upon subsequent viewings). Strong performances from all of the lead actors--especially Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson--provide ample humanity and depth to the story and set the stage for a big finish in the final chapter.",1450742400,2,2825,4.964059196617336

6808295,2,B00PH1H6TK,"The more I watched this series the less I liked the protagonist. Mockingjay Part 1 was where, to me, she crossed the line and felt whiny and self-absorbed.

I think the problem I had with this film was that I was wanting a film about a revolutionary and what I got felt more like a story about a young girl that endured a revolution and sort of incidentally was a focal part of it.

This film bore a striking resemblance to Captain America in its use of the figurehead character as a propaganda machine. However I found Katniss's willingness to put her boyfriend's safety over the cause of freedom to be extremely off-putting. Perhaps I could've overlooked this were it not for the fact that the other prong of the love triangle actually seemed to be developing into what could have been a more interesting revolutionary protagonist and the movie seemed to oddly condemn him for it. Your mileage may vary. A lot of people seemed to really like this one so I might be in the majority but I tend to be more susceptible to these sorts of symbols so I am not wholly surprised.",1450569600,,1072,4.464285714285714

Still, being the third installment means if you have made it this far you are pretty much invested to see it through to the very end whether the quality has somewhat eroded or not.  I am still left hoping that the shortcomings of this will be solely due to being split into two movies for the sake of time constraints.

Honestly, the premise was quite interesting. The end of the first one does a good job of making you want to see what happens in the second one. So I watched Catching Fire, which was equally as interesting. The movie kept my interest, there was not sex or foul language, just a lot of actions and adventure. I don't think this series creates quite the cult following that Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings created, but it is still good. I will definitely see Mocking Jay part II to see how it finishes out, now that I'm this far in, I feel like I need the closure :-) Overall very interesting movie.

It's been so long since I read Mockingjay that I can't say exactly how closely the movie follows the book but that hardly matters as the film is nearly flawless in it's own right.  The weakest part of the books, in my opinion, was the last half of Mockingjay in the invasion of The Capital.  I'm anxious to see how this is treated in part 2.

6808383,5,B00PH1H6TK,It is a good series.  Having read the books before hand most likely helps a great deal as there is much to the back story that is only given a single line or phrase.  Reading the books helped fill in many holes or omissions.  Excellent editing and good action.,1449619200,,260,4.26530612244898

6808388,1,B00PH1H6TK,"Total disappointment after I enjoyed the first two movies. Having read the books, splitting the final book into two movies is really just money grubbing! I saw the final installment last week, part 2, and it was a boring, predictable closure to the series. If they had made just one slick, fast paced finale, editing generously the boring dialogue, then it would've been more entertaining.",1449532800,3,389,5.0

I am looking at this purely from the perspective of movie entertainment and not comparing it to the books, simply because I have not read them.  I may just have to check out the book format after watching these!",1449532800,,261,4.416666666666667

6808441,3,B00PH1H6TK,"By now we all know the story of Katniss Everdeen so there isn't much to say on that.  This part takes us through the start of the rebellion and how Katniss gets recruited, albeit reluctantly, only to discover that Peeta has been captured by the Capital.  The movie played fine but I had to keep the remote in my hand the whole time because the music and machine noise would come on extremely loud but then you couldn't hear what the characters were saying, so I was constantly adjusting the volume up or down.  I'm thinking of sending it back because of that but I think I should try it on someone else's system to be sure its not just mine.",1449360000,,641,4.2809917355371905
