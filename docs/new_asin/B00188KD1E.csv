3412239,4,B00188KD1E,"I could tell what the audience was thinking during ""Hamlet 2,"" especially since it was so sparsely populated and virtually no one was laughing. They didn't think it was funny. They were most likely offended, to be perfectly honest. How fortuitous they should see a movie about a high school play so outrageous, people actively try to prevent it's opening. When a down-on-his-luck high school drama teacher faces the termination of his department, he writes a musical sequel to Shakespeare's ""Hamlet,"" in which the title character and Jesus Christ use a time machine to stop everyone from dying at the end. ""Hamlet 2""--the film--is at times vulgar, at times silly, and at times so desperate for a laugh that it doesn't know when to quit. But it's also refreshingly daring, and by the time we get to the first performance of the controversial play, we realize that there are moments of inspired writing. We also realize that it's funny to see Elizabeth Shue play a caricature of herself, a caricature that quit acting in favor of being a nurse in a sperm bank.

""Dreams are ephemeral,"" says the narrator at the beginning of the film, ""so where do dreams die?"" We then see a shot of a sign welcoming us to Tucson, Arizona, and it's there that an irreverent story of resurrecting those dreams unfolds. Tucson is where recovering alcoholic Dana Marschz (Stephen Coogan) is now living, barely getting by as a high school drama teacher. You can't help but pity this character, a man so blindly devoted to the performing arts that he doesn't realize how embarrassing he is, to himself and to others. All of his attempts to break into acting had failed because, as he eventually admits to himself, he has absolutely no talent. His only remaining option was to teach drama in an Arizona high school, a class that two and only two students selected as their elective. The closeted Rand Posin (Skylar Astin) and the racist Epiphany Sellars (Phoebe Strole) remain in Marschz's class to this day, and they always star in his unimpressive, uninspired adaptations of recent blockbuster movies.

On the first day of the new year, Marschz enters the theater and discovers it full of students, and much to Rand and Epiphany's chagrin, most of them are Hispanic. The sudden surge in attendance is easy to explain: Drama is the only extracurricular activity to survive massive budget cuts. But it doesn't stay that way; the mean-spirited Principal Rocker (Marshall Bell) tells Marschz that Drama has also been cut, meaning this is his final year as a teacher. Hoping to resurrect Drama--and maybe earn some respect along the way--Marschz begins writing an original musical play, one that he claims will metaphorically examine his relationship with his father. For whatever reason, this will include minimal nudity, some sex, and a creative reinterpretation of Jesus Christ. One of the songs will be called ""Rock Me, Sexy Jesus."" The parents, as you can imagine, are offended by the idea of Jesus being portrayed as sexy. Then one of the cast members explains it: if Jesus were to be brought back today, His image would be accepted in much the same way a celebrity's could be. It's a strange idea, but it actually makes sense.

So does the entire film, albeit in a very unconventional way. My personal reaction to Marschz was, for the most part, just the same as every other character: he's downright humiliating. But there's something about him that you can't ignore, something that makes you want to root for the success of his play. Despite social skills that would embarrass a five-year-old, he is a nice person, and much of his hardship is undeserved. Consider his relationship with his wife, Brie (Catherine Keener); she's fed up with everything, including her husband, especially since they've had no luck conceiving. Marschz completely fails to notice how she feels, although not because he's intentionally trying to neglect her. It's because he's alarmingly nave. He doesn't pick up on anything, not even when the truth is staring him in the face. It's quite possible he doesn't want to pick up on anything. All he wants is to exist in a purely creative world, free from vigilantes who try to run him over for producing a forbidden play. It doesn't matter that he's found a venue outside school property to stage the show; ""Hamlet 2"" will never see the light of day, not if the Tucson community has anything to say about it.

Here enters Cricket Feldstein (Amy Poehler), an attorney for the ACLU determined to help Marschz keep his play going. She's so fiercely protective of free speech, it's almost as if she intentionally picks fights with anyone who has an opposing viewpoint. There's a moment when she actually encourages a firefighter to hit her, and you just know it's only because she wants to sue somebody. Who can say whether or not she had any affect on ""Hamlet 2,"" the play? All I know is that Marschz and his students somehow make through rehearsals to opening night. I won't say what happens or how the film resolves itself; what I will say is that ""Rock Me, Sexy Jesus"" is a surprisingly infectious song. On the same token, ""Hamlet 2"" is a surprisingly infectious movie. It's a juvenile comedy on the surface only--underneath, it actually has something to say. I'm not sure everyone will get the message, considering the reaction of the audience I was in. But as one of the parents says during the opening night performance, ""I'm simultaneously disgusted and fascinated."" My feelings exactly.",1220313600,,5494,4.853944562899787
3412240,3,B00188KD1E,"Let me start off by saying that the entire ""Rock Me Sexy Jesus"" number in the film is genius, pure and simple. Harkening back to the classic ""Waiting for Guffman"", and tying in the themes of an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, ""Jesus Christ Superstar"", director Andrew Fleming has a sequence in this movie is that irreverent, hysterical, and oddly catchy (yup, the song went immediately on my iPod!). It is both sublime parody and a rocking good time. So I have to ask, what the heck happened in the rest of the movie? I have to say that Hamlet 2 is one glorious mess.

Starring the brilliant British comic Steve Coogan in the role of a drama teacher fighting for his craft and department. Told by mean principal Rocker (a subtle nod to the musical?) that the funding has been cut, Steve tries to rally his drama class, filled with rejects from other closed electives, to make an outlandish muscial sequel  called Hamlet 2.

Coogan misfires unfortunately, looking something like an Eric Idle/aging Beatle wannabe, in his teacher performance. Goofy and unbelievable, he steps all over the film, in sometimes embarrassing ways. Oh yes, he IS funny in many scenes, but in others, I cringed, just waiting for him to get out of the scene. Fortunately, the class of kids he teaches rebound well, and anchor many scenes with both comedy and realness that Steve lacks. In fact, it's in the kids that some of the message rings true. Ethnic stereotypes are cracked as Steve visits the home of ""Heywood"" (that, in itself, is a joke), only to find out the trouble making gang banging kid is actually an honor roll brainiac. Sweet!

Or maybe it isn't Steve. Maybe it's in the editing, or a script with characters that just didn't add up to much. But there were many scenes that seemingly detracted from the main thrust of the film, and bogged down the plot too much. For example, both Catherine Keener and David Arquette have nothing much to do in this movie -- other than fill scenes with apparent goofiness. Watching this film was like watching a giant quilt, with some panels unraveling before your eyes, and some that were stunning.

People have likened this movie to early John Waters movies. Perhaps. Perhaps in several years from now, people will look at Hamlet 2, and it's brilliant absurdity, and wonder how anyone could diss it. In the meantime, I'll queue up ""Rock Me Sexy Jesus"" and dance my night away.",1220227200,,2398,4.68646080760095
3412241,5,B00188KD1E,"This was an incredibly funny movie with an incredible performance from Steve Coogan. The acting was fantastic, the plot was wild, uneven, and insanely funny. The last 20 minutes are the best. Watching the actual musical is one of the great cinema moments. A fantastic film. Cannot wait for the DVD.",1220140800,2,298,4.862745098039215
3412242,4,B00188KD1E,"HAMLET 2 is a star-making vehicle for Steve Coogan.  It's a wildly uneven but often wildly hilarious film that rests almost entirely on this terrific British comedian's shoulders.  It's the story of a superbly incompetent high school drama teacher /director, living in Tucson.  He's a failed actor (shown to us in wonderfully pitch-perfect commercials that he was once in, including for a herpes medicine).  He's got a wife that he loves (Catherine Keener) but is too clueless to see that she hates him.  And his drama department consists of one girl and one boy, for whom he writes stage adaptations of popular movies like ERIN BROKOVICH.  He's so insecure in his skills that when the ""critic"" for the school newspaper trashes his shows, he's sent into fits of inchoate rage and self-loathing.

One day, his class grows in size because all the shop-class students are displaced by a renovation and sent to take drama.  He's now got a couple dozen Hispanic students who know nothing about theatre and he clearly fears them because he assumes they are all gang-bangers.  But Coogan, to his credit, reigns in his terror and is determined to teach these kids something about theatre.

It's his great chance, and naturally, he seizes up creatively...unable to decide what to write.  Eventually, he turns to HAMLET for inspiration, and wonders to himself, ""What if Hamlet DIDN'T die, but was able to use a time machine to go back and stop the tragic events that unfold in Shakespeare's classic play?""

Believe it or not, this is the most rational part of the musical extravaganza Coogan cooks up.  He finds himself freer and freer to express his personal frustrations (particularly at a long absent father) through his work...and his creation of HAMLET 2 begins to incorporate religion (most notably in the hilarious show-stopper ""Rock Me, Sexy Jesus"") and psychology into this twisted, increasingly experimental piece.  The school board gets word and shuts down production.

I think I'll stop there with the plot.  While plenty of things HAPPEN in the movie, it's the tone and spirit with which they occur that makes the movie successful.  It's a sloppy piece in many ways...shifting madly between silly slapstick (the student who keeps getting smacked in the head by objects Coogan carelessly tosses around) and family tragicomedy (Coogan's struggling relationship with Keener...who is, as always, tart and intelligent, but this time with a sheen of cruelty...it may be her least sympathetic performance ever.  Still good...she's just SO unlikeable!).  There are moments of sublime randomness (such as the moment Coogan meets actress Elizabeth Shue...played by Elizabeth Shue.  Again, I won't say more...but it's fun!).  There are moments of clich&eacute; (many of the jabs at theatre are straight out of WAITING FOR GUFFMAN)...but there are just as many moments when the clich&eacute; is broken.

My favorite example is when Coogan's new ""favorite"" student announces he can no longer appear in HAMLET 2.  He assumes this is because this young T-shirt wearing kid is being bullied by an ignorant, education-hating father.  Turns out, dad is a brilliant scholar, lives in a huge home and objects to HAMLET 2 not because of its take on religion and sex...but because it is so badly written.

When the show is finally staged, it is typically over-the-top.  I've never seen a high school with the wherewithal to stage a Broadway scale production...but somehow, HAMLET 2 makes it mostly work.  The show is so gloriously inventive that the audience can't help but marvel.  The movie does a great job of showing that theatre can have the power to stop you in your tracks and make you go ""whoa...that's cool.""  It also shows that people sometimes assume that a show will take one approach to religion when it really is something else.  (The reaction to the aforementioned ""Rock Me Sexy Jesus"" is the perfect example.)

But really, the film works because Coogan is so maniacally over the top.  He reminds me of a strange combination of Gene Wilder and Jim Carrey...but unique as well.  He brings a sweet desperation to his portrayal.  This is a man who has done nothing of note, and doesn't expect to...but for one VERY brief moment, he might make a difference to the lives of others.  One COULD say he steals the show...but he IS the show.  Keener is good, Shue is funny, David Arquette is not annoying and Amy Poehler's brief role is terribly written...but none of it really matters because of Coogan's honest portrayal of a lost, loony drama teacher.

The movie is rated R due to some pretty strong language...but beyond that, I think most of the best jokes will only be really appreciated by an adult crowd.  Kids will laugh at the broader stuff...but it's the subtle revelations that make the film special.

(On a personal note:  the movie is set in Tucson, but was filmed entirely in my town of Albuquerque, NM.  I'm glad they placed it in Tucson though, because they take a lot of nasty digs at that town!  While Albuquerque was spared the attack...it's a shame that Hollywood insists on mocking mid-sized cities as ""Hicksville."")",1220140800,,5125,4.946198830409357
3412243,3,B00188KD1E,"Hamlet 2 is bound to field comparisons to Napoleon Dynamite or the plenty of other films that have been made due to Napoleon's surprising success. It is comprised of similarly chaotic characters in unusual situations brought to a comedic extreme. Dysfunction and eccentricity are the fuel for Hamlet 2, but it takes the extra step other comparable comedies have reeled back from - the R-rating. Vulgar at times and offensive at others, it keeps up a steady flow of laughs with easy exploitations such as race and religion. And it is indeed funny.

Hamlet 2 is set in the place where dreams go to die: Tucson, Arizona. Failed actor Dana Marschz (Steve Coogan) has turned to teaching drama class as a means of survival, and must contend with being an utter failure at that as well. His former-drug-dealer wife (Catherine Keener) offers little stability to his turbulent life, in which Dana must deal with the possibility of being infertile, a harsh theater critic, overenthusiastic students, and a Principal who doesn't appreciate the fine arts.

When the school electives are cut down, drama suddenly becomes the only choice, filling Dana's classroom with unruly and indocile students. As he somehow manages to draw talent out of the more irreverent students, a fiscal crisis hurls the arts programs onto the chopping block, and Drama class is shut down. But in a last attempt to nurture his own artistic struggles and the hidden talents of his ramshackle acting troupe, Dana writes and choreographs a highly controversial play. The sequel to Hamlet, Hamlet 2 focuses on undoing the tragedies that led to the principle players' deaths - with the help of a time machine, Jesus, and impulsive song and dance.

Biting sarcasm and comical vulgarities hide the fact that few of the jokes are intelligent. Blatant racism and religious spoofs are easy methods of hilarity, and they ceaselessly level the audience with laughter and unease. There are serious bits of drama occasionally mixed in, but the characters are so unordinary that normal reactions can't possibly be anticipated. The power of booze, foul language, clich media extravaganzas, bold offenses and oodles of enthusiasm make up for any lack of talent and the questionable editing of the film. Praise must be given to Steve Coogan who magnificently supports the entire film and keeps up viewer interest almost single-handedly.

Narration and title cards are used (Act 4: Hope is a Demon Bitch), Elisabeth Shue shows up to play herself, and Amy Poehler unleashes the most cynical lines as her typical character (""I'm married to a Jew - I've got nothing to lose""). Some of the most rewarding moments are the unbelievably well-lighted and choreographed song and dance sequences during the play itself, and the many ramifications of desperately straying from the beaten path of decency. Aside from the extra special meaning to Arizona residents (Tucson is the butt of many a joke), Hamlet 2 is highly entertaining nonsense - perhaps as amusing as it is repellent to the easily offended.

3412244,5,B00188KD1E,"This GOT me on SO many levels.  I laughed, I cried, I leapt to my feet and danced.  What resonates with a person is subjective... utterly personal, of course.  My favorite movie of all time is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Miracle-Worker/dp/B000RZLH28/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Miracle Worker</a>&nbsp;(1962), about a teacher who gives everything to enlighten someone in darkness.  Not long ago I saw&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adam-s-Apples/dp/B00W70AF2O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adam's Apples</a>, about a priest who despite evil and lunacy in the world gives his all to his flawed parishioners- as goofy and sincere as Hamlet 2, for me (despite considerable violence) a sheer delight.  At various crossroads in my sorry early life teachers, especially drama teachers, made all the difference.  I was painfully shy and took drama from junior high on to try combat it.  I had a drama teacher in high school nearly a dead ringer for Steve Coogan's Dana Marschz.  Later, I worked in commercials and as an extra, so I could identify there with Marschz's backstory as a failed actor.  Like Elizabeth Shue, it was not the life for me.  But despite all his woes and missteps, Marschz gives and gives and gives some more.  People like that in the world inspire me, give me hope.

And then there's Steve Coogan himself.  I am in awe of his seeming endless talent.  I first saw him in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Trip/dp/B005UHIDKC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Trip</a>&nbsp;about a year ago, and have since sought out everything I could find of his.  Despite being most notably a comedian, I think he's one of the finest actors in the world.  Really.  He's one of the very few who so thoroughly ""inhabits"" his characters that he's nearly unrecognizable.  Even Meryl Streep or Johnny Depp, as good as they are, don't disappear entirely.  The only person who comes to mind at the moment who could was Robin Williams, IMO, though I'm sure there are others (Dustin Hoffman in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tootsie/dp/B000I9X53W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tootsie</a>). Dana Marschz,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alan-Partridge/dp/B00IOH83AK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alan Partridge</a>, Tommy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saxondale/dp/B01737VSUS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saxondale</a>, Coogan's Martin Sixsmith in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Philomena/dp/B00IGI3LMC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Philomena</a>, his myriad other characters, and Coogan himself are all utterly distinct, never the twains shall meet.  And in Hamlet 2 he evinces not only a flawless American accent but American mannerisms- no small feat to obscure English ones.

I'm rambling, but I simply LOVED this movie- the characters, the goofiness, the unpredictability, the originality, the political incorrectness, the give it your all- the show must go on sensibilities, the MUSIC (phenomenal- indeed, after giving it some thought, I realized that it was the music that most of all made this such a smash for me- I later downloaded the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Soundtrack/dp/B001D4YKK8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Soundtrack</a>&nbsp;and listen to it often, particularly the Ralph Sall Experience's splendid version of Elton John's peculiar ""Someone Saved My Life Tonight"", Everlast's marvelous ""What It's Like"", and ABC's ""The Look of Love"").

And to top it all off (***SPOILER ALERT***), we have ever-sincere, optimistic Marschz- a humble man who gives all that he has to others, morphing into a moonwalking-on-water JESUS CHRIST, the KING of humility, generosity of spirit and forgiveness (with elements of The Force and Star Wars thrown in for good measure).  Fabulous.  I did think the crude sexual allusions and profanity, and Amy Poehler's character, period, were unnecessary (though his profane outbursts served to signify when the normally reserved and erudite Marschz lost his cool), but for me Hamlet 2 shone oh so brightly anyway.

Yet, even with Elizabeth Shue, Amy Poehler, and Catherine Keener, the lesser-known actors playing the high school students often Own the scenes.

I've never seen a movies with so many elements intended to be funny, which aren't at all so.  From failed slapstick - teacher kicks a garbage can in anger, and it strikes a female student in the head ""Can I borrow your phone to call 911?  It's a free call.""  Tee Hee.
To cartoonish characters - an ACLU lawyer whose egotism and anti-Semitism is only matched by her puerile speech, apparently having learned English in a locker room.  One of her last lines, which (like many things in this movie) was supposed to be funny and wasn't - was ""You know, and those Bible-humping protesters can suck a bag of XXXXs.""  As reviewer Lisa Kennedy put it, ""Amy Poehler's turn as an ACLU lawyer is all very First Amendment.  It is also tiresomely crude.""

From Wikipedia:  The NYT states that the film ""made sure to take shots at Christians, gays, Latinos, Jews, the American Civil Liberties Union, and Elisabeth Shue, one of its lead actresses.""  Well, we really can't expect accuracy from either of those sources.  As for taking shots at gays, was that supposed to be including a talented gay chorus in the play to sing songs like Flashdance, without any logical reason for needing the chorus to be gay?  Seems more like promotion than mocking.  Would a shot be ""playwright"" Dana making Hamlet's Leartes gay because Dana decided that his student Rand, who would play the part, was gay?  Or perhaps at the end, Rand deciding after therapy that he was gay (Hollywood 2008 - No other result would be possible) and was at peace and on opening night, after attending no rehearsals, wanting to be back in the play, and his request being met with a resounding ""Of course!""  Or maybe the shot was supposed to be hidden in the song played during the credits, with its chorus of ""Hey, hey, hey - Go gay!  Hey, hey, hey - it's OK!""  The shots at Christians are not so thoroughly disguised.  Take just the title of the song ""Rock Me, Sexy Jesus.""  Naturally, the characters in the movie objecting to the play's blasphemous moments are mocked, and made to look ridiculous.

The basic premise of the so-called play is Dana exorcising his ego, wanting to make peace with his father.  This is wrapped up in lame trappings of using a time machine to save the fictional characters of ""Hamlet"", which all die in the original play by Shakespeare.  For no other apparent reason than lack of creativity, Dana throws Jesus into the cast of characters.  But this is the Jesus of Hollywood, so expect stupidity like him moonwalking on an imitation of water, and physically kicking a character dressed up as Satan, while the chorus sings about ""Kicking Satan's butt,"" with a very bright character in the audience shouting out, ""Wait, I totally get it.  Jesus kicks the devil's ass!""  Once again, there's supposed to be humor in this somewhere(?) Totally.

The excuse for a ""play within a play"" is disjointed, illogical, and dysfunctional.  So is the set-up.  Suddenly, the drama department is flooded with uninterested students because of more practical classes being cancelled.  In spite of having the biggest enrollment ever in Drama Class as a result of other class closings, the word is that if the next play is not successful (as reviewed by the school's 8th grade drama critic) that class will close, too.  Not dramatic enough?  OK, more pressure to supposedly make us sympathetic to the group in that they are now denied use of the cafeteria for rehearsals, and must share the gym with practicing sport teams.

Within the context of the movie, the lame nature of the play apparently is totally irrelevant compared with the offensive things in it.  Thus, suddenly the ACLU appears, the students in the play are totally hyped, and (from all the other students of the school who previously couldn't care less about drama) - we have the football and wrestling teams volunteering to act as security, to ensure the play goes on.  We're also to believe that those who objected to the play still had no problem with buying tickets, and attending.  The idea of a play with no dramatic or moralistic grounding being presented by a drama group with a complete history of failure even has them getting opening night TV news coverage, and the NYT (if it's bad, count on their support) has even flown someone in to cover it.  Finally, at the end of the play, Principal Rocker, reveals that his wanting to stop it wasn't because the ""play"" was objectionable or implausible or just plain stinky, but rather, he was fighting it because he was molested as a child, and concludes ""Maybe that's why I'm so angry.""  What PC puke!

The Monty Python group wrote ""The Meaning Of Life"" with the intention of having something to offend everyone.  They also did religious satire well with ""The Life Of Brian.""  The major difference is that the Monty Python group know what humor is, and are masters of it.  The gang behind ""Hamlet 2"" do not, are not.

3412329,5,B00188KD1E,"I have seen this movie three or four times now and it just gets funnier. Maybe it's because I live in Tucson, the deserving butt of many of Hamlet 2's jokes. Steve Coogan's portrayal of Marszt (a self-described ""parody of a tragedy"") as a complicated, oblivious, endearing and weirdly inspiring character (who rollerskates) is almost miraculous, and his ball-baring high-kick totally destroys me. Katherine Keener, as always, is fantastic as his horrid wife. This film is smart and literate without being smarmy, and loaded with incredible sight gags and one-liners. This is one of those rare comedies that aspires to be both funny and emotionally compelling, and succeeds. (Another film that I think of is ""Observe and Report."")

Just to give you an idea of my sense of humor, there's a nudity warning, but as you know, in this day and age male butts are never not funny, whereas ""raunchy comedy"" genre boobs are generally not funny. I don't know which ding-dong decided naked young women were an essential ingredient for laughter, but they forgot that women make up a majority of the population, and we simply are not amused by T&A. (No, I don't mind admitting that I'm a woman who thinks T&A is stupid, anti-funny, and anti-woman and I know I'm not the only one who thinks so). There is no gratuitous T or A in this film, and if you pause it on the high-kick, you really can't see testicles (we've tried). But you just know they're there in that vague fleshy space, which makes it funnier. Definitely not a ""Basic Instinct"" moment in that scene, or any of the numerous scenes in which Coogan's other end makes an appearance. Let's just say the character's butt has symbolic meaning and is necessary to our understanding of his situation, which makes his bare a** intrinsically NOT gratuitous. :) Personally, I don't find the ""Rock Me Sexy Jesus"" skit offensive, but somebody might, even though, thematically, this story is all about redemption and forgiveness.",1370476800,,1963,4.859701492537313

If you are an arts educator in a public school, get together with another arts educator, have dinner and drinks, and watch this movie.  Laugh at what works- hold on to the gems in the dialog, and think about your show choir producing Rock Me Sexy Jesus.  Maybe have some design envy over that skull.

It fails as a coherent story, it fails in terms of pacing and character development, and it fails as a parody because it consistently misses the mark.  However, I can recommend the movie to anyone who
- enjoys watching Steve Coogan make funny faces and shout.
- would like several chances to see Steve Coogan's naked butt.
- likes to hear show-tunes that have lots of curse words.
- enjoys occasionally laughing and simultaneously eye-rolling.

Hamlet 2 did make me laugh a few times, most notably at scene wherein the main character verbally attacks a cat.  It's that kind of movie.  And I have to give it to Coogan, he absolutely goes for it in this film.

Steve Coogan is hilarious, both a wonderful physical actor and a superb deliverer of very clever writing.  It is unafraid to offend--songs like ""Raped in the Face"" and ""Rock Me Sexy Jesus"" are going to push many people's buttons, but they are to a point, and when Jesus forgives his father at the climax of the play Hamlet 2, the film becomes more than just a comedy.

His loser status is enhanced throughout the film as his job faces the school district's financial axe, his wife Brie (Catherine Keener,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/An-American-Crime/dp/B00177YA6U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">An American Crime</a>) runs off with another loser, and his classroom becomes overrun by gangbanger wannabes who've been run out of their own building. But with the new infusion of students comes an opportunity for Dana. Always wanting to produce his own musical/drama stage play, he comes up with a great idea: Hamlet 2. Yes, THAT Hamlet. ""But doesn't everyone die at the end of Hamlet?"" someone asks rather perceptively.

Though this be madness, yet there is method in it. I think...

Hamlet 2 is just ...wrong. Wrong on every level imaginable. Religiously, philosophically, and instructionally, this is just so ...wrong! Which makes it just a tad alright. As Dana unleashes his play, great and terrible things come out, including Christian extremists and art critics. When the phenomenal stage song ""Rock Me Sexy Jesus"" begins playing, it proves just how off-kilter this film really is. Which, again, makes it a touch okay. ""I get it now! Jesus is sexy!""

The film lacks coherency in terms of a distinct direction. It seems that the goal of the film is for Dana to hit rock bottom before succeeding with an impossibly absurd stage story sequel to one of the greatest plays of all time.

The funny thing about Hamlet 2 is that the acting is really bad. And it appears that it is MEANT to be bad so that there is bad acting within a story that's about bad acting (and writing). Even so, this hints at the level of comedy that director Andrew Fleming was shooting for; a layer upon layer theme that works and doesn't work.

But, if for no other reason, you need to watch the film to see the ""Rock Me Sexy Jesus"" number. It is so bad, it's good.",1255651200,3,2347,5.3468834688346885

I enjoyed myself overall. I did not regret in any way the time spent on this. But I would never watch it again. Lots of very clever and funny bits, plenty of effective sight gags, a screamingly funny Amy Poehler, a quirky, but not too quirky, Catherine Keener, and an over-the-top Steve Coogan all do not compensate for the fact that this film tries to have it both ways. Is it the inspirational teacher movie, the ragtag group of losers who bond to become a cohesive and successful unit, or is it a satire of the inspirational teacher movie? Well, it tries to be both, and thus becomes neither.

As well as indecisive, it also tackled too many themes for its own good. The drama critic bits were perfect, so funny I almost choked. (And a nice touch by someone who has no love of critics, I bet!) But the stereotype breaking moments, the anti-censorship attacks, the tormented sexuality, and the ""I was molested as a child"" stuff, were neither cleverly satirical nor effectively dramatic. If it was satire, it was way too limp. If drama, it was way too gooey.

Hamlet 2 is one of those movies that you watch expecting to laugh but end up waiting anxiously for the laughs that never come, faking a chuckle here and there but just getting more and more disappointed; by no means should you EVER spend money or time on this terrible piece of filmmaking that boasted a clever title and winning trailer (enough to get me into theatres) but delivers nothing at all in the way of laughs.

3412367,1,B00188KD1E,"Hamlet 2 is a moronic attempt at a parody, seemingly relying more on the shock-value of being profane or repetitively politically incorrect to garner some cheap laughs. However, most of the stuff is pretty stupid, unoriginal or unfunny. I found Coogan's character to be more idiotic than humorous, and many intentions to be funny don't hit their mark.

It's too bad, because the premise of the film was actually pretty good. When one high school teacher (Steve Coogan) has his drama program pulled from him, he takes measures to make sure the show will still go on. However, he has to not only try to get approval for his show, but turn some goof offs into actors who can perform his newly formed sequel of Hamlet. The film is a parody of some of the inspirational teacher films, such as Dangerous Minds or Dead Poet's Society. However, many of the bits to try to make fun of these films fall flat, and it is not really a very good rendition of satirizing Shakespeare either. So, in the end, this is a film that fails in everything it tries to be.

Another annoyance was the means by which this film tried to be funny. The film employs many politically incorrect and objectionable moments in the play's final production, and though they do this for some humor, most of falls flat or, just like a cheap production of Hamlet, is poorly delivered. The potential was there to make this a really good satire of Shakespeare's Hamlet, but the directors don't steer in that direction. Not that one expects much from a film like this, but most of the characters were also completely underdeveloped, and serve more as stage props than anything else.

3412369,3,B00188KD1E,"Steve Coogan is Dana Marschz, a former actor who freely admits that the only thing that kept him from fame and fortune was his complete lack of talent. Yet his passion for theater burns on. He attempts to share his passion by teaching drama at a high school in Tucson, Arizona. When he learns that the school is cutting the theater department, Marschz decides that his first original opus is the only way to save his job. Hamlet 2 is born from this epiphany -- a story of hope, second chances, forgiveness, a time machine and a sexy Jesus.

There was a lot written about how funny this movie was when it was released. The whole movie, and Steve Coogan separately, were reportedly little-known comedic gems of the year. I thought there were some very funny moments, but the level of humor this movie is billed to contain is misleading. Marschz's life becomes a series of disappointments that lead up to a big, controversial finish. There are a few one-liners along the way that add will make you laugh, but this is not a movie that will make your sides hurt from continuous laughter.

Steve Coogan has a very ""Monty Python"" demeanor; he has the slapstick, physical-comedy, tragic-hero, Eric Idle approach. If ever anyone could recreate Eric Idle's cameo in National Lampoon's European Vacation, Coogan is the guy. To conceal the true controversial nature of Hamlet 2, very few details of the musical are divulged as the movie moves along. For me, this meant that the story was a little weak, but I can see how the impact of the big finish would have been lost had more been shared over time. But with so little material, Coogan was just ok. There are more laughs from situations in which he has no pants on then from much of his dialogue. I do not know much about him, but I feel that he was wasted in most of this movie. But he truly shined in his non-speaking moments, especially during the musical at the end. But then again, maybe that is where his talent lies...

Anyone remember Catherine Keener? Four years ago she was probably one of the most promising actresses (after earning an Oscar nomination for her role in Capote) and here she is as Mrs. Marschz in a bizarre comedy about a high school drama department. Now you understand my bias when I say that she was a fish out of water here.

As a story about troubled high school students who become inspired by an unlikely, but passionate teacher, Hamlet 2 is clich and falls apart. Without the actual production of the Hamlet 2 musical within the movie of the same name there is really nothing worth seeing here. But give me a spinoff movie of Amy Poehler's foul-mouthed, ACLU-attorney character and I might even see it in the theater.

Save your time. For a better version of this movie, The Family Guy did an episode where Peter produces his vision for The King and I (""The King is Dead"", Season 2, Episode 7). It's funnier and significantly shorter than Hamlet 2.",1241654400,2,2923,4.570610687022901
3412370,5,B00188KD1E,"Andrew and Pam Fleming co-wrote this bizarre, irreverent, hilarious, and completely original comedy . . . I must confess that I fear for their neighbors, because this pair views the world from a completely different point of view than the rest of us.  While that's a boon to the movie-going public, I'm not sure I would want to borrow a cup of sugar from - Lord knows what they'd ask for in return.

If ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is a spoof of all teenager coming-of-age comedies, then ""Hamlet 2"" is a spoof of the ""Let's put on a show"" genre.  Set in the completely mediocre town of Tuscon, the movie revolves around one Dana Marschz, a drama teacher who seemingly would have to aspire to great heights to achieve mediocre.  Played by Steve Coogan with a zany pell-mell brio that brings to mind a young Eric Idle, Mr. Marschz is a semi-successful actor who has fallen on hard times.  Now he teaches drama to mainly disinterested high school students and puts on derivative plays based on successful Hollywood movies.  His marriage to Brie (Catherine Keener) is falling apart before his ignorant eyes and he can only roller-blade to work.  Where, I should add, he is being fired due to budget cuts.

His career trajectory, one might say, has flatlined.

But then he decides to stage his magnum opus, a sequel to Hamlet.  How, you ask, if everyone dies in the first one?  Simple - a time machine!  Not content to insult the legacy of Shakespeare's most famous play, Dana manages to offend virtually every sensibility in town.

But from Dana's madness comes greatness.  Perhaps only through his unwavering faith in Art and the fact that he lives in a parallel universe where Elizabeth Shue plays herself as a local nurse (Shue having grown tired of the phoniness of Hollywood), but Dana believes he has created an artistic masterpiece.

The cool thing is, he may be right.  Or he may be spectacularly wrong.

If possible, try to avoid any spoilers - this completely original movie must be experienced without any warning as to what is to come.  Several gut-busting comic gems await if you do.

3412372,3,B00188KD1E,"Hamlet 2 is a very inconsistent movie. It is simultaneously laugh-out loud funny as well as maddening in the dozens of dead ends and wasted characters that are introduced. It is either a case of bad editing or poor writing, but this movie could have eliminated at least two characters completely without affecting the plot and could have eliminated a hand full of scenes for similar reasons as well. Steve Coogan is a funny enough actor but he can not carry this movie on his own. There are times when he tries too hard and has your finger itching for the remote and, yet, there are other times when he does a nice take on the lines he is given. I am curious as to why he had to lose the accent because I think it would've made his role a bit more convincing and comical - the failed English actor in Tucson - but the writer/director had other ideas. The whole Elisabeth Shue part is genius and the actors and writing for the high school students is believable and well-done. On the other hand, Arquette and Kenner are unnecessary and the small amount of influence their characters bring to the plot might've just as easily been inferred or done off-screen and we would've then been spared Kenner's painfully contrived role and Arquette's largely mute inclusion. Additionally, there are many issues that are touched upon but in such an ephemeral manner that it is little more than a squandered opportunity; e.g. child abuse, coming to grips with one's sexuality, psychological counseling, alcoholism, cultural stereotyping, pointless relationships, and dreams crushed in the face of harsh realities.
It is not until the performance of the production at the center of the movie that this uneven offering hits its stride. The musical numbers are hilarious and the reactions of the angry mob and the thug enforcers are priceless. Also, the short-lived but utterly brilliant work of Amy Poehler as the ACLU lawyer further helps to salvage this movie and make me put it on my shelf rather than take it back to the video store for a trade-in.
I was interested in the movie because it eschews political correctness and skewers close-minded religious types. It further hits home for me because it is set in Arizona in a public school and the crack of Tucson being the place where dreams go to die is a funny albeit harsh jab at the southwestern world where I have spent much of my teaching career. Those reasons brought the movie into my home and the exquisite satire of the play within the movie is what will keep it here.",1236038400,3,2515,4.679458239277652

Steve Coogan plays a failed professional actor, running a failing high school drama program in Tuscon, AZ, a place where ""dreams go to die"".  Coogan's failing because, the truth is that he has no talent.  His idea of putting on a play is adapting a hit movie (e.g. ERIN BROCKOVICH) into what turns out to be an atrocious stage production.

After the school drops Drama from its program, Coogan decides to go out ""in style"" with his original new take on Shakespeare's greatest play, a rock musical that pushes every boundary and causes a community uproar.

The real strength of this move is the performance of the actors, ranging from his best student's parents, whose shared derisive attitude towards Coogan's character is hilarious, the critic for the school newspaper, who shares their contempt, and Catherine Keener, Coogan's wife who's regret for marrying him is painfully apparent.
The direction is somewhat ham-handed, particularly in the transition to the climactic scene, but once that moment hits, there's a whole new layer of humor, especially regarding the local townspeople's outrage at the content of Coogan's musical, which are totally inappropriate for local social mores.

3412377,2,B00188KD1E,"""Hamlet 2"" stars Steve Coogan as Dana Marschz, a failed actor-turned-high-school drama teacher.  Low on the talent scale, Dana still has ambitions and harbors passions, but only at work.  At Tucson's West Mesa High School, Dana regards himself as an inspirational teacher, but his adaptations of popular films performed by his top students, Rand and Epiphany (Skylar Astin, Phoebe Strole), are not clicking.  When his latest effort, re-creating ""Erin Brockovich,"" is panned by the ninth grade drama critic and his department is targeted for elimination, Dana conceives a sequel to Shakespeare's ""Hamlet,"" a Busby Berkeley-style musical theatre extravaganza that will embrace neither political correctness nor dramatic credibility.
 ""Hamlet 2"" is an amusing movie, but it's not easy to warm up to Coogan, who plays Dana as a loser deluding himself that he can spark students with lame notions of innovation.  As the film progresses, however, the viewer becomes involved in the outrageousness of plot turns and Dana's dedication to his art, however strange it may be.  Best thing in the film:  Amy Poehler as ACLU attorney Cricket Feldstein.  Bonus extras include deleted scenes and a sing along.",1230422400,2,1194,5.347593582887701

Physical comedy is my mainstay in theater.  Just off the top of my head: Steve Coogan is a superb physical actor (his drunk on roller skates is unbeatable) He is well within range of Buster Keaton's world.  The writing is smart, well-paced, knowledgable about teen-agers, and surprisingly free of salacious humor that usually begs for the lowest common denominator these days.  (If all this sounds like too much praise for a film comedy, then you haven't seen enough trash onscreen!) Loved it.  D. Harscheid",1226361600,20,640,4.888888888888889
3412380,4,B00188KD1E,"Hamlet 2 was either hailed as great comedy or despised by critics.  The former group could probably see that this was satarizing a genre of film in the most unlikely way, while the former though it was becoming a genre film with a slightly offbeat sense of humor.

In the film, Steve Coogan plays a wannabe actor who's done infomercials, commercials, and appeared as an extra in Xena and found his way as a drama teacher who unsuccessfully adapts hollywood films into plays. He lives with his girlfriend played by Catherine Keener and a border played by David Arquette, who has a couple good bits, but really has little to do in this film.

When Coogan discovers he has a large class and that his class is set to close due to funding cuts, he decides to write the outrageous Hamlet 2.  Here's where people get confused.  On one hand, it appears that this film is taking the turn of every high school film where the teacher inspires his students to do great things through his relentless pursuit of a goal.  But in reality, it's lampooning them but doing through chracterization, which is why the film's so much fun.  But if you didn't get it, wait for the DVD and watch again.

And of course, while the film is funny, it's uneven until you get to the play itself.  Yes there's funny bits with Elizabeth Shue and brief interplay with Keener, Arquette, and Coogan, but as the play takes shape, we know it will inevitably take center stage.  For the finale alone, the film is worth a watch as it's some of the most hilarious things I've seen on film in years, even if is borderline offensive.  That's the point, right?  My only major gripe is why on earth did Coogan have to use an American accent.  He's such a funny Brit.",1225065600,4,1720,4.4743589743589745
3412381,3,B00188KD1E,"Dana Marschz (Coogan) is a bad actor who has been relegated to teaching high school drama.  There are two kids who want to be in his class, but the rest are there because they are ""trouble"" kids and the principal had to put them somewhere.  Dana, however, wants to make a difference and challenge these kids.  Previous plays that class performed were adaptations of movies, and garnered little accolades.  Dana decides to write something original, and ""Hamlet 2"" is born.  This musical sequel to Shakespeare's masterpiece soon raises the ire of the principal.  After he attempts to shut it down, Dana and the class take the play off of school grounds, and soon the community is clamoring to see exactly what all the buzz is about.

""Hamlet 2"" is an interesting idea that is only somewhat effective.  I almost wish that there was more shown of the actual play, in which Hamlet goes back in time to become friends with Jesus.  The play is never fully flushed out, and we are only treated to  snippets, including the musical number, ""Rock Me Sexy Jesus.""  (They actually give a good reason why this song is not blasphemy).  Coogan is good and the talent-challenged Dana, the poor schlub with a good heart.  The problem with the movie is its unevenness, alternating between really funny and not that funny at all.  This is one to wait for on DVD.",1221523200,,1342,4.6553191489361705
3412382,4,B00188KD1E,"I kept flashing back to Christopher Guest's hilarious 1997 mockumentary,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Waiting-for-Guffman/dp/B00005LC5D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Waiting for Guffman</a>, as I was watching this raucous 2008 comedy, and in this case, that turns out to be high praise. Directed and co-written in ramshackle fashion by Andrew Fleming (whose most prominent credits include the 2003 remake of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-In-Laws/dp/B0000BWTIB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The In-Laws</a>&nbsp;and an episode of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Arrested-Development/dp/B000JJ3Y78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Arrested Development</a>), this wacky concoction mixes broad slapstick, harmless raunch, and politically incorrect humor with a heavy, tongue-in-cheek dose of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dangerous-Minds/dp/6305428271/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dangerous Minds</a>&nbsp;(referred to in the film) and every other clich-driven movie about a schoolteacher who serves to inspire his students. The result is something of a mess when it comes to telling a coherent story, but it's also an infectious movie that had me laughing heartily during most of its 92-minute running time. It comes as no surprise that Fleming's writing partner is Pam Brady, who is most famous for producing and writing several episodes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/South-Park/dp/B0018O5WUU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">South Park</a>, as well as the 1999 movie version,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/South-Park-Bigger-Longer-Uncut/dp/B000022TSW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">South Park - Bigger, Longer & Uncut</a>. The similarities are quite apparent.

The plot is predictably absurd and rather inspired. Manitoba-born Dana Marschz is a failed TV commercial actor who has ended up teaching drama in a Tucson high school. He has just finished directing a stage production of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Erin-Brockovich/dp/B00003CXFV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Erin Brockovich</a>&nbsp;starring the only two students enthusiastic about his over-the-top, highly derivative approach to theater. Marschz is trying to earn the respect of the pre-adolescent critic of the school newspaper but to little effect. His wife Brie hates him and yet wants to have a child. At the same time, they are forced to take in a tight-lipped boarder named Gary to make ends meet. Things change dramatically on the first day of the new semester when Marschz inherits a classroom full of Latino students who could care less about drama. Told by the principal that drama would no longer be part of the school curriculum, Marschz decides to go out fighting and stage a long-gestating work-in-progress, a musical sequel to the Bard's most famous work entitled, of course, ""Hamlet 2"". What happens after that point is a freewheeling comedy of errors that gives Marschz's demented optimism the perfect vehicle.

Looking like Eric Idle's younger brother, Steve Coogan gives an audaciously funny performance as Marschz, a pitiable character in the most obvious ways but undeniably likeable. He flails somewhat during the more vulnerable moments probably because his performance is so otherwise manic and vainglorious. By comparison, Christopher Guest's Corky St. Clair in ""Guffman"" has moments of weakness, but his character resonated more simply because the humor came from a more serious state of self-doubt. However, Coogan is a superb physical comedian, especially on his ever-present roller skates. Back in hippie-chick mode from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-40-Year-Old-Virgin/dp/B00005JNZU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 40-Year-Old Virgin</a>, Catherine Keener is hilariously toxic as Brie, while Amy Poehler gets the funniest lines in her smallish role as ACLU lawyer Cricket Feldstein, an overly enthusiastic activist with a bigoted streak a mile wide.

Elisabeth Shue gets to play a parody of herself as washed up in Hollywood and forced into what she says is a more fulfilling career as a fertility clinic nurse. While she is charming as usual, Shue is not given nearly enough to do here. There are bright turns by Skylar Astin as the closeted Rand and Phoebe Strole as the unctuous Epiphany, both alumni of Broadway's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spring-Awakening/dp/B000J3FBFC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spring Awakening</a>, as well as from Joseph Julian Soria as the brooding actor-wannabe Octavia. The normally hyperactive David Arquette plays strictly against type as near-silent Gary. The much ballyhooed production that provides the film's climax is not quite as outrageous as ""Springtime for Hitler"" in the original 1968 version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Producers/dp/B000BMY2LU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Producers</a>. However, it is funny enough despite the fact that ""Rock Me, Sexy Jesus"" sounds like a familiar doo-wop song with wittier lyrics. I just wish Brady and Fleming spent a bit more time on consolidating the plot structure. Some of the story meanders without reason, and then it just stops without incident. Regardless, there is plenty of laugh-out-loud entertainment here for the undemanding viewer.",1220832000,22,5566,7.052098408104197
3412383,3,B00188KD1E,"How does one create a sequel to a story in which all of the main characters die at the end?  Such is the question posed in Hamlet 2, to which the answer must invariably be...by crafting a time machine, picking up Jesus and traveling to various times in history.  Obviously, there's no other conceivable answer.

Hamlet 2 is about a high school drama teacher, trying to save his department from going the way of art programs when budget cuts rise.  Or, is Hamlet 2 a parody of the Mr. Holland's Opus/Dead Poets Society/Dangerous Minds-type of movie in which a professor takes a ragtag group and presses on them a love of whatever he/she is teaching?  Or, is Hamlet 2 a deconstruction of a tragedy, begging the question that if the heroes don't die at the end, what's the point, as one person asks in the movie?

Or, is it a satire on the way irreverent material is taken in our society, by presenting the two opposite extremes embodied by the principal who threatens bodily harm against the drama instructor and the ACLU lawyer who doesn't care what the merit of the production is?

And that's the rub of this movie.  There's a lot of ideas floating around in Hamlet 2, but it often feels as if screenwriter Pam Brady (who shares writing credit on the South Park movie) continued to throw ideas on the wall, watching to see which of them stuck.  It's uneven in both the humor quotient and in the meaning quotient.  It poses too many questions to be just slapstick/no-brainer comedy, but it doesn't accurately dig into the questions to really merit it as satire (South Park, this ain't).

In the end, it's a silly movie with sometimes hilarious moments, but more often than not, it fails to elicit much reaction.  When the best moments are the actual production of Hamlet 2, which lasts all of twenty minutes, you know you're in for a bumpy ride.",1220400000,,1844,4.571428571428571

I heard this film was decent...an indie film, but written by actual professional, qualified comedy writer Pam Brady (South Park, Lady Dynamite).  I thought even if this is a lackluster movie, like ""around the world"", Coogan will redeem it.  I was wrong.  This is irredeemable.

The concept is good.  And maybe seeing glimpses of the bizarre musical, the titular hamlet 2, in the film's finale, will be enough to warrant paying for it.  But for me, it was not.  I'm not a movie expert.  I can't break down what was wrong with this movie.  All I can say for sure is the jokes were not there.  The movie, as presented, appeared to have been written by people that cannot write jokes.

I want to conclude with a shoutout to a bizarrely infuriating plot hole, wherein a student that left production of hamlet 2 early on, rejoins the cast in the middle of their performance, and somehow fits in and knows all the lines.  The tone of the film was all wrong for that sort of incoherence.

If you love this movie, that's great, party on.  If you're thinking about renting it, I honestly feel ripped off, so I advise against it.  Best of luck.",1510444800,,1305,4.5085470085470085
