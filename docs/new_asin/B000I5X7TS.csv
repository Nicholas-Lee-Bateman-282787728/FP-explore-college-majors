8143995,3,B000I5X7TS,"Because I LOVE Alex Borstein I cannot give her less than 3 stars. Her genius is far beyond this stand-up. Although honestly, this one was rough. But because it is Alex I will of course buy it.",1462752000,,192,4.216216216216216
8143996,3,B000I5X7TS,I didn't find this very entertaining as far as it being comedy.,1425686400,,63,4.333333333333333
8143997,5,B000I5X7TS,"Alex Borstein is funny, and in her stand up, she keeps bringing on the funny. Most of her stand up is speaking against the stereotypes and objectification of women.",1407369600,,164,4.689655172413793
8143998,1,B000I5X7TS,Borstein needs to stick with her voice-over work (where she is truly gifted) until she can come up with a performance better than this. She relies too much on material she hasn't even written (Hollywood casting breakdowns) to get the laughs and to make a point. A point which we all know...Hollywood has set an ideal for women that no one can live up to. The most interesting part of the DVD is a behind-the scenes look at the offices of Family Guy. If you are looking for stand-up from a women's point of view that is much more insightful and actually delivers the laughs check out Margaret Cho.,1242259200,3,596,4.477064220183486
8143999,4,B000I5X7TS,"Those use to Alex's persona on Mad Tv are in for a shock,while she is just as funny,if not more so...She has one hell of a foul mouth. So if you're easily offended or can't stand swearing,avoid this dvd. Otherwise you're gonna have a great belly laughing time at this.

Alex does do a couple of impersonations,my highlight being her impersonation of Renee Zellweger. This dvd is worth viewing just to see the real Alex at work,not the edited for tv version. Great dvd for any comedy/family guy/mad tv/Alex fan",1168300800,5,509,4.655555555555556
8144000,5,B000I5X7TS,"WOW!!! I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD LIKE THIS LET ALONE WRITE A REVIEW!! FROM THE OPENING ACT

A GREAT RETRO LOOK AT A TIME WHEN COMEDY WAS BLUE, REALLY, REALLY, BLUE. I LOVED IT. TEDDY TOWNE WAS THE PERFECT INTRO AND I MUST SAY A SEAMLESS SLIDE RIGHT INTO ALEX BORSTEIN ACT. YOU GOTTA SEE THIS!!!! I DONT WANNA SPOIL IT.",1165276800,,316,4.180327868852459
8144001,5,B000I5X7TS,Alex is a very funny lady. She keeps you laughing and intrigued from beginning all the way to the extras. Get a couple DVD's for your friends. It's nice to have a funny lady around.,1164499200,,181,4.2
8144002,5,B000I5X7TS,Sharply written and delivered one-woman show that goes right after Hollywood and all of its resident alien creatures and craziness.,1163548800,,131,5.6
8144003,5,B000I5X7TS,"I got the chance to preview Alex Borstein's new stand-up act Drop Dead

Gorgeous and it's nothing short of drop dead hilarious.  She is a

natural on stage who is as funny as she is original.  Her material is

new, fresh,  genuinely funny, and while it's plenty raunchy, she doesn't

rely on that for laughs.  It's great to get to see Alex in action, in

real life as opposed to her animated work as Lois on Family Guy.

She imitates, she sings, she dances (some would call that dancing

others....well) and everyone is a potential target.  A MUST buy for all

Family Guy and Borstein fans.  And if you're not yet a Borstein fan,

you're about to be...",1162857600,6,652,4.406779661016949
