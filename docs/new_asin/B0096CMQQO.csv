8536580,5,B0096CMQQO,"After Rick Stevens, Globe Trekker was one of my first favorite travel shows. Ian Wright and Justine Shapiro are my favorite host in the series, and  love the fun, adventurous, layed back, & non-sugar coded vibe of the show. I'm glad Globe Trekker has brought out a collection of that. Definitely a keeper for Globe Trekker fans",1483315200,2,327,4.7368421052631575

8536584,5,B0096CMQQO,"I choose 5 stars because i remember how much i loved the series when it was last on T.V in New Zealand and great to have it on DVD really inspires you to travel & see the world.

I liked all aspects of the shows they are well done and love the theme music.

Would recommend to anyone who loves travelling or wants to travel,it may be a little dated but still great enjoyment and iam sure some things are still relavent today. Love seeing Ian Wright again.",1400284800,3,455,4.159090909090909
