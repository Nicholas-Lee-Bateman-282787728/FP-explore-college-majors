549925,4,6303073093,"Sometimes a movie is over-hyped and sometimes, you accidentally over-hype it yourself.  This was the case for me with ""Gate of Hell"".  If I'm not mistaken, it won the premier Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.  I think that it was a special award that year for a category that made its' official appearance the following year.  The Oscars themselves tend to over-hype but, when they generally only cite one foreign language winner a year, that movie usually is worth seeing.  And so, for that matter, is ""Gate of Hell"" but I have to admit that I was expecting a bit more than I got.

The directing is good, the color is unusual for a foreign film of that era and, although its' a bit faded today, I can see that it must have garnered some notice back then.  The costumes are outstanding which, I believe, led to their other Academy Award that year.  The story is a simple one but it is well developed.  Briefly stated, a Samurai risks his neck for the right side in a revolt and is awarded anything he wants by his grateful emperor.  His only wish is that the emperor arrange a marriage between him and a maiden that he had met.  The only problem is, she wasn't a maiden; she was already married to the head of the palace guards.  ""Sorry"" says the emperor.  ""You promised me anything I wanted"" responds the samurai.  The story then becomes that of a man's obsession and a woman's devotion to her husband.  The ending is poignant and the director did a good job in bringing it all together in the end.  We are left with each person's interesting perspective on what had just occurred.

The acting is fairly decent.  I am becoming something of a fan of Machiko Kyo who plays the female lead.  I first noticed her in ""Rashomon"" and again in ""Ugetsu"".  She apparently picks her roles well and she always does an excellent jub.  The man who played her husband came across a bit better than the one who played her suitor, in my opinion.  This is a movie worth seeing if you don't mind the subtitles.  However, I don't want to spoil it for you by over-selling it too much.",1097280000,6,2076,4.419525065963061
549926,3,6303073093,"Perhaps in its time, Gate of Hell was a moving, stirring drama, but for me this movie was a mediocre, if not at times crude, movie.
After remaining faithful to his lord, and distinguishing himself in combat, Moritoh Endo is permitted to name his own reward.  He requests to marry Lady Kesa, the wife of the Imperial Gate Guard, but this wish is refused.  For the rest of the movie, he obsesses about her, and tries to win her by force, which of course ends tragically.
Machiko Kyo as Lady Kase does stand out, but overall there is nothing exceptional about this movie.  The quality of the video is not that great either.
Unfortunately, I'd have to say that the movie was somewhat of a disappointment.",1075075200,4,700,4.5396825396825395
549927,4,6303073093,"In 1953, Teinosuke Kinugasa (1896-1982) directed and co-adapted the historical play entitled ""Jigokumon"" (English transliteration of the Japanese title), which was written by Kan Kikuchi (1888-1948).  The film's name (the same as the play) translates into English as ""Gate of Hell"", and was released theatrically in the U.S. in 1954.  The story takes place in 12th-century Japan during the Heian period and at the start of a revolt.  During the confusion and fear running rampant through the royal palace in Kyoto, a lady of the court, Lady Kesa (Machiko Ky), is rescued by a soldier named Moritoh (Kazuo Hasegawa, 1908-1984).  After the revolt fails, Moritoh is told that he can have anything that he wants, and what he wants is Lady Kesa to be his wife.  He is quickly told, however, that she is already married to Wataru Watanabe (Isao Yamagata, 1915-1996).  Rather than seek something different, Moritoh becomes dangerously obsessed with Lady Kesa.
Filmed in beautiful & vibrant color (probably one of the first color films from Japan), the cinematography in ""Gate of Hell"" is exquisite.  The story is by no means dated, though it does become somewhat predictable.  Still, it is both compelling and engaging and the acting is superb, especially Machiko Ky.  Memorable scenes in the film include the confusion at the royal palace, Laky Kesa hiding from traitorous soldiers, Moritoh meeting Lady Kesa and her aunt after the revolt, Moritoh given the choice of his heart's desire, the horse races, Moritoh at the home of Lady Kesa's aunt, and the ending scenes.  The makeup used on Moritoh could have been better.
The film won several awards including an Oscar for Best Costume Design, an Honorary Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and the prestigious Grand Prize at the Cannes Film Festival in France.  Overall, I rate ""Gate of Hell"" with 4 out of 5 stars.  Hopefully, the film will be fully restored and released on DVD one day.  I highly recommend the film.",1070150400,38,1972,4.975609756097561
549928,4,6303073093,"I first saw this at a revival in the early eighties and couldn't believe how beautiful it was. Then I got this video and was suprized that it wasn't nearlly as beautiful as I remembered. The reason wasn't a bad memory, but  the original prints used for showings have rotted in film vaults, and have  become blurry, faded, and scrathy. I was very disappointed that Home Vision  didn't present this digitally remastered and restored with new computer  subtitles (the subtitles are quite crude). That's the reason I didn't give  this five stars other than that, this is one of Japan's greatest  masterpieces. The ending is pretty sad but has a beautiful ending. The  degree that Moritoh will go to get Kesa is trully horrifying and Moritoh  transforms from a herioc samurai warrior and hero of the film to a maniacal  barbarian and villian. Recommended, but maybe the more picky film viewer  who has an outburst everytime a scratch line goes down a film should  perhaps wait until this is restored to the experiance it once was.",946512000,21,1025,4.767045454545454
549929,4,6303073093,"This is not a movie for those looking for a Slashing Samurai movie, but for those truly interested in historical Japan it is a must.  The fighting is not great.  The costumes alone are worth watching.  Very tragic, very  beautiful, reminiscient of a classic theatrical tragedy.  It is  particularly interesting as portrays medievil Japan instead of Edo Japan  like most others.",945302400,3,377,5.081967213114754
550122,5,6303073093,"I bought this movie as a Christmas present for someone who enjoys gorgeous costuming.  However, I expected the story itself to be a bit dull or predictable - and that we might zone out (the way I felt with Sophia Coppola's Marie Antoinette).  Instead, the movie was both visually stunning (with remarkable resolution and detail for a '53 film) and enticingly suspenseful.  This may be the best film I have seen this year and it is going on my list of favorite films.",1419724800,4,466,4.590361445783133
550123,5,6303073093,"This is one of the most beautiful movies ever made. The story is heartbreaking and disturbing. But the acting is great.

I think that it would be difficult for some people to read the subtitles because they'd get distracted by  the overall picture which is just so amazingly BEAUTIFUL!

Beauty and content, in a classic jidaigeki!

What more could a person desire?

550124,4,6303073093,"Great colors, good story.  The ending (the very, very tip ending just before the curtain falls) was a bit flat, though.  After all that happened, I thought ""Mmm....""  (Don't want to give anything away....)  Everything leading up to the end, though - well worth the price of admission.

One thing that struck me as odd was the way the heroine Kesa and her husband, while obviously wealthy and of very high social status, seemed to live a very secluded life (very few other people around, particularly children and servants).  Maybe this had something to do with production costs.  Anyway, it's not important to the drama.

Also, if you've read Eiji Yoshikawa's Heike novel you'll get a kick out of seeking Taira no Kiyomori ""in the flesh""!",1416960000,,738,4.801587301587301
550125,5,6303073093,A powerful film. A great study in Japanese cinema. Full of cultural Japanese ideas that are excellently portrayed.,1414886400,,114,5.388888888888889
550126,4,6303073093,"operatic - adjective, of, relating to, or characteristic of opera. extravagantly theatrical; overly dramatic.

Jigokumon (Gate of Hell) is proudly ""operatic"", it reminds one of Tosca, Kesa  being Floria Tosca, obviously. Even the plot itself of Gate of Hell is operatic: a samurai warrior Morito Endo wins a major battle and helps his ruler  to suppress rebellion. In return, the ruler offers to grant any Morito's wish. Morito says he wants to marry Kesa, lady-in-waiting, but it transpires that Kesa is already married.

Morito still wants his wish granted, he even goes to see Kesa and threatens to kill all her family if she won't leave her husband and marry him. Kesa, seeing this man violent and dangerous, agrees to help him to kill her husband. But instead she stays in the bed where Morito thinks her husband would sleep, and he kills Kesa instead of her husband.

It's not just operatic, it's Shakespearean, bringing Othello and Macbeth to mind as well. Even though the script is not that great, the film's beautiful color (Eastmancolor, Technicolor predecessor), its brilliant scene design, acting - all makes it really worth seeing. Even though the color is brighter than life, is it not the case with any opera scene? Japanese traditional costumes, scenes of Kesa and her husband enjoying moonlight in the garden - all shot in brightest colors - and still with a lot of taste.

The film also very interesting psychologically: Morito, the protagonist, is shown as a person who wins battles - and this is exactly why he cannot be tolerated in any human society. He spoils pleasure during dinners by being unreasonably aggressive. He threatens his beloved - instead of trying to win her affection. He even kicks - with no apparent reason - a perfectly harmless dog which happens to be nearby. Yes, the producer Kazuo Hasegawa does drive his point home.

Still, even though this film sometimes looks a bit formal, it's a great work of art.",1406678400,,1948,4.884848484848485
550127,5,6303073093,"THIS is how I remember this film from the Thalia Art Cinema release in NYC back in the early 60's.  I was dumbfounded when I first saw it. Dazzling color that you couldn't believe. It almost hurt your eyes!  I bought a VHS many years ago and was profoundly disappointed by the film.  The performances were still terrific but it all seemed so subdued.  I put it down to youthful over response to new stimuli.  I ordered this because I'm going through an intense rediscovery of Japanese cinema (maybe it's 2nd childhood?) and wanted to replace all my VHS tapes.  WHAT A SHOCK!!  There it was! Everything that I remembered!  The color still hurts your eyes (Criterion explains it all) and the intensity was all there again. If you can remember the first time you saw Gone With The Wind and how brilliant the Technicolor was, then you will understand how startling the Gate of Hell is!  (they didn't use Technicolor but a process that was brighter but less stable.  read all the Criterion notes).  Everyone should own this DVD! No If's, Ands, of Buts!!

550128,3,6303073093,A Treasured Piece !!!!!  They are not making movies with the flavor of BY-GONE DAYS.  The era was depicted beautifully.,1395705600,,119,4.9
550129,5,6303073093,"The self-anointed 'dean' of Western critics of Japanese film, Donald Richie, famously said that GATE OF HELL (Japanese JIGOKUMON) was a ""limp film with flaccid performances by Hasegawa Kazuo and Kyo Machiko"" (he inverts the names of the actors as they do in Japanese -- think similarly Bartok Bela in the Hungarian usage).  I don't know if he was having a bad day when he saw the film or if he was coming down from one of his benders when he wrote his critique, but he could not have been more wrong.  I refer you to M. Hart's review for a pr&eacute;cis of the storyline.  I want to concentrate on the quality of the film itself.

If anything Hasegawa's performance as the samurai Moritoh is anything but flaccid.  Indeed his style is rather overripe for many Western viewers but I believe the director Teinosuke Kinugasa wanted to contrast his behavior with that of the sad-faced Lord Wataru, wonderfully underplayed by Isao Yamagata (I am not inverting Japanese names in this review).  Moritoh is all snarling fury and barely suppressed rage while Wataru is all reasonableness and dignity.  The object of their devotion, Lady Kesa, is stunningly played by Machiko Kyo who gives perhaps her greatest performance or at least one of her greatest.  Having seen this film something like eight times, I find that I am ever more riveted by the subtlety of her every gesture and expression.  Indeed I watched this film a couple of days ago and I discovered an ambiguity in her reaction to the blandishments of Moritoh that I had never caught before.  Multiple viewings of this film will similarly reward you.

If you want some background on the history and culture of Japan that will greatly help you understand the context of this film, and any Japanese film for that matter, you might want to read George Sansom's 3-volume history of Japan.  It is an older work but a fairly thorough one.  A more recent, and shorter, history is JAPAN:  ITS HISTORY AND CULTURE by W. Scott Morton and J. Kenneth Olenik.  Also recommended is JAPANESE CULTURE by Paul Varley.  These books clarify the Heian Era in which this film takes place and will explain references to the Taira clan, the role of Buddhist monks as rulers, and the the controversial role of the emperor Go-Shirakawa.

Oh, and like everyone else who watches GATE OF HELL, you will be stunned by the truly amazing color palette and cinematography provided by Kinugasa and Kohei Sugiyama.  Please give this film a try -- you won't be sorry.",1391644800,5,2484,4.7372093023255815
550130,5,6303073093,"10 minutes into this film and you will say you've never seen color like this in a film. i was worried about the restoration...they tend to want to sharpen the image, and they never do it right. they didn't here, they just simply made it spotless. the compositions as always are superb and makes great use of space.

This is a ""samurai"" movie, but really doesn't have swordwork in it, it is mostly about love and obsession.  It does of course have depictions of traditional Japanese society, and is well done in this respect.  Also they have remastered the colors, and it is very bright and colorful, and cinematically and cinematographically beautiful, really bringing alive the clothes, and the era in general.",1390089600,,486,4.9753086419753085
550202,2,6303073093,"Very pretty colors, particularly for its time, with sumptuous silks of that ancient Japanese time are elegance personified. Glorious (but simple, not show-busy) sets, dramatic lighting, manic attention to details from sets to agonizing slowness of plot, settings and fifth-century fauna in meticulously reproduced manor gardens.

And then, perhaps a very authentic rendition of a time which is beyond our understanding. Far from our values and beliefs to thrust its way into inscrutability. And not in a nice way. This isn't 'entertainment' in a Western sense. More of a head scratcher.

It's of cinematographic interest because of its vivid colors plus perhaps how privileged Japanese classes values have evolved in eight centuries. Pity the then upper classes if their values drove them into such masochism - not in physical pain, but of issues of love, fidelity and personal honor. Still, they were swathed in such luscious silken robes.

Why did this pretty but tear-filled relic win an Academy Award? I can only guess it was
a dazzling film filled with such luscious colors and elegant designs for its time. The recent restoration is a knockout. Perhaps it's also that Teinosuke Kinugasa was the premier star of women characters played by men, displaying stunning kimonos making men and women equally beautiful. The inspiration, Kabuki theater/dance art.

(One thing; anybody, please enlighten me: Though Kazuo Hasegawa is credited with this film on Amazon's product page, Criterion says the director and prime driver behind the script, color and production was Kinugasa (from the thorough and rather lush itself pamphlet accompanying the DVD)

At 171 minutes, with its more comprehensible and enjoyably layered plot it dwarfs this 89-minute fashion show. Even costs a lot less too.",1388188800,2,2197,5.726993865030675
550203,5,6303073093,"Taken from Akutagawa's (Rashomon) tale ""Kesa and Morito"" starring Machiko Kyo (Rashomon, Ugetsu, and others), directed by Teinosuke Kinugasa, is a splendid color film made in 1953 and awarded an Academy Award for best foreign feature. Set in 1160, it is the story of a beautiful married woman who is mistakenly asked for her hand in marriage by a court samurai who has been granted a wish as a reward for faithful service during a battle (this is where he meets the fair Kesa). The samurai is played by Kazuo Hasegawa and the husband by Isao Yamagata.

I've waited a long time for this restoration and it is nicely done. I have a videotape which kept me going for many years. This drama is played out as Kesa is deeply troubled by the misunderstanding that has occurred and tries every way she can to get out of the situation gracefully, but Morito is not to be dissuaded, even insulting her husband during a horse race between clans.

This is a suspenseful, luxuriously filmed production, ending eventually in tragedy as often happens in Japanese period pieces.",1377302400,,1062,4.735135135135135
550204,5,6303073093,"`Gate of Hell' is a story about loyalties. All those who transgress their loyalties, and are beaten or unmasked, are sent to `Hell' through its `Gate'.
In this movie, the loyalty operates at the social (clan) as well as at the personal level. Rival subjects of the emperor break loyalties by fighting each other for a privileged position at the court. On the other hand, unrestrained passion and sexual harassment of wives of other clan members are also considered as an unacceptable conduct. One of the participants of the yearly `ceremony of conciliation' among the clans is simply thrown out of the ceremony for his aggressive behavior. Finally, there is also the loyalty of a wife to her husband.

Teinosuke Kinugasa's movie shines through its magical mix of color and light, with dark scenes for unrestrained passion and light ones for beauty and self-sacrifice: every frame of every shot is simply a formidable Japanese print. It shines also through the masterful directing and the restraint acting of its main female character. Ultimately, it shines through its treatment of such almighty important themes as the battle between `good and evil' / `war and peace' resulting in `life or death' for its protagonists.

While Carl Theodor Dreyer's `The Passion of Joan of Arc' was a pioneering feature film because of its camera movements and its bold focalizing, and while Dziga Vertov's `Man with a Movie Camera' was a pioneering movie because of its brilliant shooting angles, its split screens and its rhythmic `one by one frame' editing, Teinosuke Kinugasa's `Gate of Hell' is a pioneering movie because of his magnificent play with light and color, turning it into a grandiose spectacle.

550205,4,6303073093,Well worth watching and yes the colors are preserved well. I bought the DVD which is fine. I don't know if the Bluray would be significantly better.,1374278400,,148,4.518518518518518
550206,4,6303073093,"When it comes to filmmaker Teinosuke Kinugasa, his name may not be as familiar with Kurosawa, Ozu or Nagase to the Western world but his accomplishments have been noticed within the last century.

From his silent films such as""Kurutta Ippeji"" or ""Jujiro"", the latter was the first Japanese film to be released commercially in Europe and was praised for its camera work, during a time when German Expressionism was being celebrated.

It wasn't until the '50s in which Kinugasa, who had traveled around the world and met other filmmakers outside of Japan, he began to use color and also use of widescreen.

And in 1953, Kinugasa would release the film ""Jigokumon"" (Gate of Hell) which would eventually receive critical praise, winner of ""Best Film"" at the 1954 Cannes Film Festival and also winning an Oscar for ""Best Foreign Film"".

While other countries have experimented with Technicolor, ""Gate of Hell"" was among the first to showcase Japan in color and its beauty would captivate viewers at the time.

Unfortunately, for a film that was so well-revered, it was virtually a lost film.  According to Stephen Prince in his essay of the film titled ""A Colorful History"" (included in the Criterion Collection insert), Prince said ""the fragile photochemical process used to make it caused its colors to fade, and viewers could no longer see the spectacular designs Kinugasa and his team had created.""

Fortunately, because Daeie had made separation masters of ""Gate of Hell"", a full-color duplicate negative of the film was made and the film's Eastmancolor was reproduced.  In 2011, a 2K restoration was undertaken by the National Film Center of the National Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo and Kadokawa Shoten Co. Ltd. in cooperation with NHK.

And now, this restoration will be released on Blu-ray (and DVD) courtesy of the Criterion Collection.

VIDEO:

""Gate of Hell"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:37:1 aspect ratio) and it's important to note that the film features the original Eastman color look which is vibrant and well-saturated.  But because it is the first Japanese color film, the film does have a bit of softness at times. But nothing to be disappointed about.  The fact that people are able to see a film that was once virtually lost, can now see the film in color but also how affective Teinosuke Kinugasa was when it came to decorative art, lighting and more.

According to the Criterion Collection, the new digital master was created from the 2011 2K restoration undertaken by the National Film Center of the National Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo and Kadokawa Shoten, Co., Ltd.  in cooperation with NHK.  For the restoration, a new digital transfer, supervised by cameraman Fujio Morita, was created in 4K resolution on an IMAGER scanner at Imagica from a 35 mm duplicate negative and several 35 mm master positives, the original camera negative no longer exists.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Gate of Hell"" is presented in monaural LPCM.  Dialogue is very good and I detected no hiss, pops or any problems with the lossless audio.

According to the Criterion Collection, the original monaural soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit form 35 mm positive and negative soundtracks.  Clicks, thumps, hiss, and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools HD.  Crackle was attenuated using AudioCube's integrated workstation.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Gate of Hell - The Criterion Collection #653"" comes no special features.

EXTRAS:

""Gate of Hell - The Criterion Collection #653"" comes with five-fold insert with production credits on one side and the essay, ""A Colorful History"" by Stephen Prince.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Gate of Hell"" left an impression on many people for its time because of its use of color.  While most Japanese films were black and white, always being an innovator, Teinosuke Kinugasa experimented with Eastman color and also widescreen.  And what people saw was a visually stunning film for 1953 and an amazing use of color that showcases the beauty of Japan's clothing to also a glimpse of Japan's environments for the feudal era.

So, ""Gate of Hell"" is an important film from the Criterion Collection as this film that has long been forgotten because of its film state, has been restored.  Being one of the earliest Japanese color films, the film would also go on to win at the Cannes Film Festival and an Academy Award, further showing that people enjoyed ""Gate of Hell"" for its cinematography but also its tragic story.

Kinugasa's storytelling is rather poetic in a tragic kind of way.

From showcasing an artwork of the Heiji Rebellion to help narrate of what was happening in Japan at the time, featuring beautiful costume and production design and effective lighting, ""Gate of Hell"" manages to showcase the beauty of the film but also showcasing the nature of people of that era.

One man obsessed with a married woman that he loves, but she does not feel the same way for him.  As a virtuous woman, she pledges her love for her husband but is willing to protect her and her husband's honor by not mentioning anything in regards to Morito.

Call it an early Japanese love triangle, the films efficacy is thanks to its talents, primarily Kazuo Hasegawa and Machiko Kyo.

Hasegawa's Morito goes from being a heroic warrior but his unattainable love for Lady Heska starts to consume him that he will not stop to make Lady Eska his and decides that he will kill anyone who would dare stop him from being with her.

Meanwhile, Machiko Kyo was amazing as Lady Kesa.  From her emotional demeanor to playing a traditional Japanese instrument, it just felt right.  But we get to see the growing sense of uneasiness from Kesa, knowing that Morito desperately wants to be with her, but knowing that she loves her husband and tries to keep herself virtuous with honor.

But how far will Morito go in order to make Lady Kesa his and what about her husband?  And how far will Lady Kesa go to protect her honor?

Suffice to say, the film ends in a non-banal way that cinema fans should be happy with.  It's not one that people can easily predict and that's also part of the charm of ""Gate of Hell"".

As for the DVD, because there are no special features, no booklet but the DVD insert, ""Gate of Hell"" will more than likely be a cheaper Criterion Collection Blu-ray and DVD release.  Picture quality is good for an Eastman color Japanese classic, no banding or artifact issues and lossless audio features no problematic issues, pops, hiss or anything negative.

Overall, a tragic film about unrequited love and ones believe in love and honor, ""Gate of Hell"" is in essence, wonderful Japanese cinema showcasing a love triangle during feudal Japan.  One of the great Teinosuke Kinugasa films which also happens to be the first Japanese color film made by Daiei Film and the first to color film to be released outside of Japan.

""Gate of Hell"" is highly recommended!",1372896000,6,6876,4.880275624461671
550207,5,6303073093,"I won't go into a plot retelling which you can read elsewhere. A capsule summary of this award-winning film could be: Fatal Attraction - Samurai Style. Only this time it's a man who desires a married woman and will not give up his pursuit of her. Also unlike the Douglas-Close film, there's no happy ending and that's as far as I'll push this simple analogy. This is not your typical Samurai film for those who want spectacular sword fights but instead we're presented a story of blind obsession and uncontrolled rage set in feudal times where one warrior's relentless attempt to break the rules of society ends with tragic consequences.

This new restoration on Blu-Ray is a breathtaking visual tapestry. Colors are eye-popping with the hues of blue standing out the most for me and details in the varied costumes are finely delineated. The mono sound is clean. Considering this film was made in 1953, we have the best version now available. One reviewer here recalls 'the color in the film I saw in the theater was brighter. Maybe due to younger eyes?'  He may be right as I also recall brighter colors when seeing it on TV years ago where I made a VHS tape for a Japanese co-worker. This may be due to older TVs with picture tubes having richer color than flat screens as RCA boasted about using 'rare earth phosphors' for our color TV. Regardless of our older eyes and memory, this glorious restoration will impress you as it does for us. At times I was so absorbed in observing the intricacies of the rich pageantry, I had to roll back the film to re-read the subtitles to follow the story.

As others have cited, there's no commentary or extras on the disc except for an essay by Stephen Prince  in the booklet. I own his fine  book on the films of Kurosawa called 'The Warrior's Camera' and he's provided great Criterion commentaries for some of those films. It's our loss he didn't provide one for this film because not only would he tell you about the film's history and the period it's set in, you would learn why camera placement & movement and editing are important in telling a story. But for me paying $15/half price on Amazon for this keeper, I can't really complain.",1371859200,5,2182,4.584615384615384
550208,5,6303073093,"A great movie, expertly acted and brilliantly directed with sumptuous colors throughout. The story starts as an action film but quickly evolves into something altogether different. The primary theme is a brilliant meditation on how unfathomable are even the hearts of those we love. It's a deep story well told, with a leisurely pace that allows the emotions of the viewer to brood and boil as situations come to a head.

Would have loved more extras, but its Criterion's budget series so we are left with just the movie and an interesting essay in the booklet (which is well worth reading once you've seen the film). I wouldn't be sad if they reissued it with more extras in the future, but suspect that might have limited appeal.

Overall it's a movie I will watch again and again, so well worth owning.",1369008000,2,805,4.702127659574468

I first saw this film in D.C. when I returned from Japan in 1954. I had seen Rashomon in Japan, when I saw Machiko Kyo in the cast, I had to see it. I was not disappointed. Her character was very different. Her portrayal showed how talented she was. The colors, as stated by others, are stunning, yet, it may be my memory but, I seem to recall the color in the film I saw in the theater was brighter. Maybe due to younger eyes ?
One thing that is very noticeable in the film, is the swordplay at the beginning. It is not the set choreography of later samurai films. They flail at each other in wild, normal fashion until someone gets hurt.",1368662400,3,772,4.1879194630872485

It is a glimpse into another world, hundreds of years in the past. The story is a simple one, of love and honor. This film can be viewed on so many different levels. Seen as an action film, a costume soap opera, historical drama or a mirror of Japanese society soon after World War Two.",1368057600,2,417,4.573333333333333
550211,5,6303073093,"It is one of the most powerful and moving films I ever saw. When it was shown at Cannes in 1954, it won the ""Palme d'Or"", beating amongst others the Oscars covered ""From here to eternity"". It also received the Oscar for the best foreign language film as well as the Oscar for the best costume design. And all those prizes were absolutely deserved.

The story takes place in Japan in 1159, during a period of troubles at the imperial capital. A valiant although hot headed young samurai Morito Enda accomplishes a great exploit and as result is asked to name his reward. He asks to marry a woman he met during the fighting, Lady Kesa, a woman he never met before and with whom he only briefly spoken the same day. But Lady Kesa is already happily married, to a very decent and honorable man and therefore his lord refuses and asks him to request something else. And at that moment the film begins...

""Gate of hell"" is an excellent film, not very long (86 minutes) but well filled with drama. The story is excellent, all actors perform at the top of their abilities and technically, this thing is a splendor! The colors are by moments simply incredible, as every opportunity offered by traditional Japanese nobility costumes was used. The director, Teinosuke Kinugasa, also kept a very strict control on all the aspects of this film and as the result he created a small but splendidly brilliant jewel.

About the story, I will not say much more, but just be prepared that this film will not only impress you, but will also break your heart. I saw it first in black and white on TV, ages ago in communist Poland and even then it completely impressed me - and now, after all this years, after finally watching it in color, I was left speechless, simply speechless.

This is a great masterpiece of world cinema. To buy, watch, keep and treasure! Enjoy!",1367971200,2,1848,4.557228915662651

550304,4,6303073093,"This is first and foremost a tragedy about obsession and a lack of communication. People don't speak when they should and they act at the wrong moments. The story takes place in 1160, a coup has failed and a samurai named Moritoh is granted a boon of his choice. He chooses a woman he met named Kesa who risked her life in an attempt to save his lord's wife. The problem is that she is already married, and actually quite happily so. This is not a story about two lovers trying to find a way, it's as I already said, about obsession and lack of communication.  Moritoh is not portrayed as a good person, and Kesa is not without her faults, yet she is loyal to her husband. It's a film that sets up early on that it will be tragic. The ending will most likely stay with you long after you finish watching.

Those looking for samurai action should look elsewhere. The opening 15 minutes or so are quite fast paced and filled with fights, but not so much after that. Honestly the beginning is actually a little too fast, unless you are knowledgeable in the history of feudal Japan, it's quite confusing. Still, if you want a good character drama, you could certainly do worse than this.

Onto the Blu: As per-usual, Criterion does an amazing job with the picture. This movie is stunning. The use of color is beautiful, and Criterion seems to have gone all out with their picture restoration. The subtitles are good and flow well with the story, no jarring moments that seem awkward in the text. Sadly there are NO special features. There is the usual booklet with an essay included, but I would have loved to have had a film historian commentary or something. There's so much going on in the film that it would be nice to know more about it.

550307,5,6303073093,"This film wowed the critics when it first came out in the 1950's.  The extraordinary medieval costumes and exquisite color compositions dazzled the audiences.  Today, even Martin Scorsese ranks the movie among his top 10 of foreign films. It must have influenced so many Japanese directors when they attempted to create their own epics.

Obviously, I prefer the masterpieces of Kurosawa or Kobayashi or Mizoguchi. This is a very good film rather than a great one. Nevertheless...this movie grows on you.  Other reviewers discuss the basic plot:  Moritoh, a warrior who quashes a revolt,  is to be rewarded for his bravery by the emperor's regent. He is asked to choose any gift from the emperor. During the revolt, he encounters the beautiful Lady Kesa, who is kind to him.  Like a fool, he demands that he be given Lady Kesa as a wife, even though she is already married to a lord of higher class.  Everyone asks him to desist.. but pride, madness, and desire prevent him from doing so.  He vows to destroy anyone who stands in his path and goes so far as to kidnap his prize. On the other side of the wall, rather than defend his wife from such outrageous conduct,  Lady Kesa's intellectual husband takes no violent action to protect her.

The scenes are enhanced by the exaggerated dramatic, strong movements of Moritoh against the delicate movements of Kesa. Notwithstanding,  she is just as strong a character as he is.  I give this movie 5 stars because I felt this was Machiko Kyo's best performance.  Every gesture of hers can be studied for meaning.

The ending of the film grabs me so much because it is pregnant with so much significance. Don't rush to judgment - think about it. There are secrets to the ending.

Postcript:  The Blu-Ray  quality is marvelous - don't even think about seeing the movie in any other format.  I also love the glorious poster artwork on the cover of this Criterion Edition.",1360886400,20,1914,4.710843373493976

550309,3,6303073093,"Gate of Hell (Teinosuke Kinugasa, 1953)

The 1950s in Japan were a great time for costume dramas. Witness Gate of Hell (Jigokumon), Teinosuke Kinugasa's multi-Western-award-winning (Oscar: Best Foreign Film and Best Costume Design, New York Film Critics' Circle: Best Foreign Film, BAFTA Best Film, Cannes Grand Prize) flick about obsessive love and its inevitable end.

Moritoh (Genji Monogatari's Kazuo Hasegawa) helps put down a revolt, and is rewarded with anything he desires. What he desires is the beautiful Kesa (Ugikusa's Machiko Kyo), but he finds out that Kesa is already married to another samurai, Wataru (Isao Yamagata of The Seven Samurai). This knowledge doesn't faze Moritoh in the least; he sets about trying to win Kesa's love by proving himself a better warrior than her husband.

It is a good film, but it could have been a better one. Midnight Eye's summary of the film says that ""Kinugasa himself was fully aware of his picture's dramatic weaknesses, and blamed intervention from his producer, an under-developed script and a rushed working schedule due to a release date fixed in advance. Whilst impressive in its performances, and the ambition and scale of its production, with a little more attention to plotting, one gets the feeling that it could have been a truly great film."" This is quite the case. While it is undeniably a stunning picture, even by today's standards-- the rather primitive film stock (this was Japan's first color film) does nothing to mask the intricacy of the set design, the brilliant, almost expressionist color scheme, or Kinugasa's excellent eye when it comes to action scenes-- the plot is presented in almost stop-motion fashion, with one excellently-acted scene after another, but nothing to tie them together.

This does not, by any means, mean you should avoid this movie. Any film containing Machiko Kyo, possibly the single most beautiful actress working in filmdom in the 1950s, and certainly one of the handful of the most talented, is well worth watching. Hasegawa makes Moritoh into a figure who is less frightening than pathetic, a man who is driven solely by his demons, who has entirely lost his soul to obsession, while Yamagata plays Wataru as a blissfully ignorant chap who is given every opportunity to see tragedy rushing towards him, but refuses until it's on his doorstep staring him in the face. It could have been great, but because it's not doesn't mean it's not good. ***",1199318400,14,2451,5.0594059405940595
550310,5,6303073093,"I saw this last night on TCM, which, BTW, is a rare treasure on the medium of the ""idiot box"".  Isn't it remarkable that this movie is 53 years old, and it still sparkles?  What an accomplishment!  It had the ingredients of a truly great film - complex characters that are developed fully and efficiently, great story-telling with attention to details, and good acting - a little stylized, but keep in mind that that impression might be due partially to Westerners unfamiliarity with Japanese culture, and partially to how the definition of ""good acting"" has evolved.

I love the film's nobility and moral rectitude.  Those were the days when (and we were in a culture where) ""doing the right thing"" was the expected norm.  It was seen in Moritoh's loyalty at the price of - at least it seems at the time - expediency, which was preceded by Kesa's unflinching sense of duty and willingness to lay down her own life. This is the beauty of Kesa's ""soul"" that Moritoh found out all-too-late he failed to see, which manifested itself as bookends in the plot, but is in fact the moral center of the movie.  Such ideals are no longer frequently or fully embraced these days.  Look at how we glorify criminals in shows like The Sopranos and Thief.  I also liked how the plot falls together: Kesa's readiness to sacrifice herself at the outset of the story made her self-immolation at the end of the film ring true. The little details: remember the talk of chestnuts when Moritoh first saw Kesa with her aunt? We saw later on those very chestnuts hanging on the swaying trees during Moritoh's unfortunate night time visit. When Wataru and Kesa took what turned out to be their last walk in the garden under a full moon, it was all peace and serenity. The very same setting is transformed sinister and ominous just moments later, with the moon now hidden by clouds, as Moritoh slowly emerges out of the darkness in the background - a truly masterful and memorable scene in the history of cinema.

The theme of ""folly"" pervades the movie: we see a lot of it just from one character, Lord Kiyamori - and he's a top dog and a leader!  His son had to advise him to act quickly to quash the uprising when we first see him.  He then failed to reward Kesa, who is every bit as deserving as Moritoh of recognition.  Even if you chalk that failure up to the times and the culture, you can't excuse his Jephthah-like stupidity and arrogance in giving Moritoh pretty much carte-blanche in his wish for a reward.  What's more, we have his incessant and insensitive teasing - instrumental in precipitating the tragedy, in that it made the proud Moritoh all the more determined to have Kesa.  Was Wataru cowardly, foolish, or both, when he ""threw"" the race?  Lest you missed it, there's the cruel irony of Moritoh's comment after his brother's treachery resulted in his execution, ""My brother was a foolish man"".  Moritoh proved to be no Solomon.

I thought it was a little frustrating to watch Kesa's helplessness when Moritoh blackmailed her.  Surely there's another way out, woman!  But I suppose that's part of the tragic theme: all the characters had strengths as well as tragic flaws. At the risk of second-guessing the director of a great movie, I felt that he could have kept the identity of the person in bed a secret until the moment of truth, but I'm sure I need to remind myself that this is not meant to be a thriller. I'd like to watch this movie again, maybe along with a movie it reminds me of: Kurosawa's Ran.",1145664000,7,3503,4.583333333333333

This film is such a rare and important film, and virtually unknown to U.S. audiences, that I want to add my ""five star"" recommendation to attempt to draw attention to this rare gem, one of my top, all-time favorite films.

I first learned of this film in the 1950s, when my parents viewed the film, while the film was on extremely limited release in movie ""art theaters"" in the U.S.  At the time, I only heard about this film's title and basic storyline.  I always wanted to see this movie, but it was impossible to obtain.  I had to wait forty years, until the 1990s, when I finally viewed this film in a ""repertory"" movie theater in Washington, D.C.

I finally obtained a video copy of this film, and then, finally a DVD from the Criterion Collection, which wisely chose to offer this (presumably restored) film to the pubic in DVD form, for which I am very grateful.

I cannot add much to the wonderful customer reviews of this film that are already posted on Amazon.  However, the jacket to the DVD disc in the Criterion Collection contains this astutely concise observation:

""Winner of Academy Awards for best foreign film and best costume design, GATE OF HELL is a visually sumptuous, psychologically penetrating work from Teinosuke Kinugasa.  In the midst of epic, violent intrigue in twelfth-century Japan, an imperial warrior falls for a lady-in-waiting; after he discovers she is married, he becomes frenzied in his attempts to win her love.  Kinugasa's film, an early triumph of color cinematography in Japan, is an unforgettable, tragic story of obsession and unrequited passion.""

The film's initial credits state that the movie is based upon a play, which is ironically titled KESA'S HUSBAND.  View the film, and contemplate the meaning of this original title.

The film's title, GATE OF HELL, has a double meaning - a monumental gate in a city wall, where severed heads of executed persons are publicly displayed, and the psychological ""gate of hell""  that the imperial samurai must endure, following his unwitting murder of the lady-in-waiting who he obsessively coveted.

The Criterion Collection's DVD comes with a fold-out insert, which probably contains much more English-language information about this film that one will obtain on-line, and which adds to the wonderful customer reviews of this film already posted on Amazon.",1471392000,,2463,5.014742014742015

Morito asks for Kesa's hand in marriage, but Kesa is already married to another lord, whom she loves, and she does not love Morito.

1953

Film = barely three (3) stars; restoration = five (5) stars; color photography = 4.5 stars; costumes and set designs = 4.5 stars; subtitles 2.5 stars; choreography/stunts = two (2) stars.  Director Teinosuke Kinugasa's tale takes place when the age of the samurai soldier class was just beginning (late 1100's).  His film begins with rousing scenes (and a matching orchestral score!) that have the look (photographed in gorgeous color) and feel (great editing) of an epic film.  Unfortunately, the excitement is fleeting (it lasts for just about one reel--less than 10 minutes):  the photoplay rapidly dissolves into stagey, melodramatic nonsense.  The score is also down sized from an orchestra to a single shamisen or koto.  Red-flag warnings that the best has come and is going/gone include:  frequent voice-over expositories (NEVER a good sign); limply choreographed sword fights (stunt extras make a big show of sword pointing, but rarely are shown to follow through); and a ridiculous chase scene (stunt performers are ""shot off "" their horses with arrows that only appear after the fact [when a ""dead"" rider is shown crumpled on the ground]).  The performance of the lead actor (who has a pathological sex-object fixation) is pretty much limited to fuming facial expressions.  While the lead actress (the sex object) pretty much plays a ""dumb brunette.""  Neither appears to have received much guidance from the Director.  Interior sets, costumes, and makeup add much to project an aura of period authenticity.  Costuming includes the use of colored horse blankets to help the audience separate the good guys who used to be the bad guys from the bad guys posing as good guy who use to be the really bad guys (or was it the other way around?).  All of whom, of course, are played by the same stunt actors.  The scenario delivers a surprise ending which is tragic but nonetheless pretty dumb.  Cinematography (narrow screen, color) and interior lighting are excellent.  Subtitles are in great need of adult grammatical editing.  They are usually too long, too complicated/abstract, and too short in their screen flash rates.  (Constantly having to press the pause button on your player to read/check translations is a royal pain!)  Great in several (mostly technical) respects, but not a great movie overall.
