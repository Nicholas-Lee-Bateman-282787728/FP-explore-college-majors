7885020,4,630519470X,"This begins with Melanie teaching a self defense class, more specifically really encouraging a woman to fight back a guy who is the ""assailant"". She looks really great, she really encourages the guy to struggle with the woman & fake slap her & this jars the woman to finally fight back for real which was great to see. This isn't the lame ""let's move slow..."" you get in other self-defense classes that doesn't feel real at all or really gives the woman the real mind-set of how a real fight feels.
The class is set outside on grass with 4 other woman in their late teens/20s. There is no music.
The intro is about 5 min about encouraging women & saying real confidence in your physical abilities is much better then fake confidence. Melanie has a great positive encouraging, positive nature, though at times she tends to talk a bit to loudly, probably making sure the mic catches her voice.
She has encouraging words in between each segment to remind you that building physical strength is important & willpower to get through the workout.
Srikes/Kicks - 7 min -  You start with horse stance/squats to build up your legs. After getting used to the position, you use that while doing arm blocks to protect your head & chest, heel strikes & overhand hammer fists. Next is kicks done slowly to focus on form: simple heel stomps, side kicks, tiny crest kick/quat/back kick combo.
Crunches - 3 min - regular, 1 leg bicycle, regular bicycle & reverse.
Push Ups - 6 min - done on knees: wide arms, tight arms, triangle hand to work the triceps, both hands facing left, facing right & rest w/wrist circles & routine repeated w/tricep stretching.
Everything below is done on both sides.
Side Laying/kneeling Kicks - 4 min - simple stomping/straight leg kick laying down, on elbows, on hands & then on hands/knee 1 leg kicks.
Intro - reminds you that strong butt muscles is very important for kicking
Hands/Knee Kicks - 4 min - on hands/knee, 1 leg kicks to sky, knee touching to elbow, swing knee from shoulder to opposite side of hip (easier then sounds), then routine is repeated & that side glut stretch.
Abs/Inner Thighs - 4 min - laing on back, stripper leg spreading & crossing for 2 min, then slowing is down to a count of 3 down & upward. Then bringing legs to chest, spread then down in a wide circle.
Stretching/Cool Down - 6 min - Stretch in a standing wide legged stretch w/heels up/down & standing fwd bend, hip stretch, 1 leg seated fwd bend & double leg fwd bend, wide angle seated side stretch, sitting wide leg fwd bend. Ends with her giving you more encouraging words for mind/body positive attitude.

This was a wonderful workout with her always encouraging you. I took off 1 star because I agree I expected more strikes & kicks from a self-defense mode. I didn't take off more because even the side laying & hand/knee kicks are good if you are fighting from the ground.",1183593600,2,2881,4.5813953488372094
