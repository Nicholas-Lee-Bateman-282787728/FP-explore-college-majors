4569981,5,B0054PSXZK,"In a world of Toddlers and Tiaras and Dance Moms, this was a wonderful movie about kids who love what they do, and most importantly work very hard to go for thier dreams.  This is a movie kids should watch and realize that reaching your dreams - whatever they are takes hard work!!!  We loved it and can't wait to watch it again!",1318032000,23,329,4.2063492063492065
4569982,1,B0054PSXZK,Sue Bourne - shame on you.  I lived in GB for 15 years.  Possibly the most beautiful 15 years ever.  I was never cheated or scammed ...until today.  I bought JIG and saw only very young children telling me that they wanted to dance.  WHAT'S NEW?  You are cheating buyers.  SHAME ON YOU.,1317945600,,286,4.283018867924528
4569983,5,B0054PSXZK,"We drove an hour to see this movie with my 7 & 14 year old Irish Dancers and we were not disappointed. They both dance competitively and they LOVED the movie.  We did not think it was too long at all, in fact it seemed just right.  Can't wait to get the DVD so their (non ID) friends can see what it's all about!",1317686400,5,312,3.859375
4569984,5,B0054PSXZK,"My 15 yr old daughter Irish Dancer and I saw this movie, we just loved it!  Being in this world for 10 years, it made our heart race with excitement.  I felt the documentary was very well done, loved seeing the three families and their stories.  Can't wait to see it again!",1311811200,13,273,4.211538461538462
4569985,3,B0054PSXZK,My 8 yr-old irish dancer struggled with the length of this movie in the theater release.  Great dancing talent but overall more 'reality TV' than big-screen. Two-three great stories of very young dancers captured - the other dancers followed aren't as captivating.  Very accurate view of the ID world at this level although the attempt to add drama in the final-scoring scenes is too drawn out.,1311292800,6,394,4.954545454545454

4569987,5,B0054PSXZK,"My daughter loves this movie! She's 6yrs old and has been dancing now for 4 years. Every night she goes to bed watching this. Her goal is WORLDS and this is a great motivator.  I love how it shows that hard work, lots of practice and truly loving what you do....you can teach your goals. ",1483920000,,288,4.218181818181818

4569990,4,B0054PSXZK,"How can one resist rewarding with stars these young, lithe bodies dedicated heart and soul to a very demanding style of dancing?
Note: It was very annoying for a sport where precision is its essence, for the subtitles to be totally out of sync with the spoken word. As a minimum, the culprit should be drawn and quartered. One star off for this infraction.",1482796800,2,356,4.578125

4570008,3,B0054PSXZK,"I knew about the wigs and dresses, so that wasn't a surprise. I wish this had gone into more detail about judging.  While subjective, what do the scores mean (and why show them when we have no idea?) and how are they determined?  Also, it was extremely annoying at times to show bits of dancing, while the music score was irrelevant and annoying.  The story line was the usual- competition, who gets the prizes etc.
Having said this, however, I'll probably watch again for the bits of dancing (and more dancing of these competitors available on Youtube).",1461456000,3,554,4.690721649484536

4570011,5,B0054PSXZK,"This is a very interesting view of the highly competetive world of Irish Dancing. We watched young dancers aged 10-20 as they train and travel to competions around the world. The dedication and talent of these children and their teachers is impressive, and equally impressive is the support of their families both emotionally and financially. I would guess that after years in this tough disciplined life at the top of their chosen art/sport these young people are well prepared for anything life offers. They have to learn to take criticism and disappointment along with the glory!",1459209600,2,582,5.072916666666667

4570020,4,B0054PSXZK,"Jig is a fun, compelling, and entertaining look into the personal lives of a handful of Irish dancers from around the globe. Lots of interviews with the competitors, their parents and coaches interspersed with clips of their practices, leading up to the big showdown... the World Competition. Although I'm not particularly a fan of Irish Dancing on its own, I do enjoy documentaries about the human experience, and I can appreciate the hard work, technical difficulty, and artistic flair that come together as the components necessary to be successful in this realm. I really only had one major gripe with the documentary content: the film is in desperate need of subtitles. I realize that everyone is speaking English (mostly- a bit of Russian and Dutch were thrown in here and there), but the various accents of people from around the world were really difficult for me to sift through. For large portions of the movie, I really couldn't understand what people were saying, and I, frankly, gave up trying and just tried to piece it together from what I was seeing on the screen, which made for a confusing movie.  English subtitles would have taken this documentary from good to great, and I would have given 5 stars.

Similarly, I have one technical gripe with this viewing: the closed captioning was not synced correctly with the movie! I streamed the movie on my computer, so perhaps the dvd is correct (if it's even closed captioned), but for me, the closed captioning started about 10 seconds after the first person spoke, then it ran so slow that by the time the credits ended, the cc was still showing words from the final scene... more than 2 minutes after they'd been audible in the movie! How thoroughly disappointing... the cc was useless... and it would have been so handy sorting out all of those accents! I don't know if this technical issue was the fault of the documentary makers or a technical function of Amazon.com itself, but I do hope that this is corrected ASAP for future viewers.",1454198400,,2005,4.791907514450867

I knew very little about it, so this was helpful to that end.  It did seem to drag in places, and I can see how this would be much more interesting to anyone actually involved in Irish Dancing.",1435276800,,354,4.057142857142857

4570031,5,B0054PSXZK,"As an Irish dancer of 14 years, this movie shed light on the aspects of dancing that other people never think of. It's more than the crazy dresses and wigs and shows like Riverdance. It's hard work, dedication, competition, and so much more. I loved this film and found it so inspiring",1431129600,,285,4.5
4570032,5,B0054PSXZK,"Great documentary/reality-tv-style-film on the world of competitive Irish dance. I use this with my students every year, and they absolutely love it- plus I don't get tired of watching it myself. Very well done.",1430870400,,211,5.235294117647059

4570037,4,B0054PSXZK,"I love Irish dancing.  Not being Irish, I was introduced to the art form when RiverDance hit the scene (I've scene the live show 6 times!) -- and have watched the DVD dozens of times.  That being said, this documentary gives you an up-close-and-personal look into the world of Irish step dancers: those young folk who, with their beloved stage moms and supportive dads who invest countless hours and dollars to give life to their dream.  It's an unbelievably grueling commitment, much like figure skating, dressage, gymnastics -- you get the idea.  But the amazing skill and joy demonstrated in this video just makes me appreciate the dance form all the more.  The film itself could move along fairly slowly for anyone not already ""into"" Irish step dancing -- but if you love Michael Flatley and could ever imagine him as a kid, learning and working his craft, this film will stupify and amaze.",1427328000,2,894,4.779220779220779

4570054,5,B0054PSXZK,"Always eager to learn something new, and a fan or Irish jig music, I decided to give this documentary a try. I was entranced by the sheer talent and poise of the characters we follow, a mix of girls and boys between the ages of 10 and 21 competing for a world championship title in several age categories. It is very easy to quickly become involved emotionally in the lives of the dancers the movie follows, and I found myself cheering out loud (literally!) by the end of the film. At 93 minutes it's a quick watch but certainly well worth the time - I was actually disappointed it wasn't longer. Rarely can a documentary be heartfelt, engaging, personal, and informative all at once, but Jig certainly does all this and more.",1413158400,,726,4.507575757575758

4570073,3,B0054PSXZK,It simply follows several young contestants in an Irish Jig competition.  I believe it is the actual contestants not actors/actresses portraying them.  It is interesting.

4570074,5,B0054PSXZK,This movie was good enough to have come straight from Hollywood. LOVED IT!! It was one of the best movies that I have ever seen,1394755200,,127,4.12
4570075,5,B0054PSXZK,"I am primarily Irish, with a mix of Welsh, British, Scottish, and other European origins.  Being only a few generations away from being born in Ireland, though, my Irish heritage is strong.  Very strong.  Therefore, Irish dance is something in which I do have an interest.  This movie, Jig, focuses on Irish dance and a group of children and young adults (aged 11-21) from around the world (though primarily from Ireland and the British isles) who compete in Irish dancing.

While the children and young adults profiled in this movie are absolutely on the elite level of dancing, and thus could be considered to be similar to the children in other reality shows such as ""Dance Moms,"" ""Abby's Ultimate Dance Revolution,"" or ""Toddlers and Tiaras,"" this movie paints a very different picture of elite dancing.  The children and young adults in the movie are pushed *somewhat* by their coaches, but they are still shown to be NORMAL people, who have lives outside of dance.  The picture painted is a much cheerier one than the one painted in other reality shows.  This movies shows that elite dancers can have HEALTHY relationships with their coaches, can have parents who didn't even KNOW Irish dancing existed until their children became interested (what a concept-- allowing your child to choose his/her own interests!), and can have lives outside of dance.

Yes, this movie does show the stereotypical wigs and dresses, but the focus isn't AT ALL on the makeup, hair, and dress, but is instead on DANCING. :)",1394323200,,1508,4.905511811023622

4570109,2,B0054PSXZK,"Positive:
Taking the time to film the doc.

Negatives:
(1.) It provided no history of Irish Step dancing - even a little would have helped in understanding and putting the dance into an historical context. Also, never found out why there were wigs and elaborate costumes. Young girls should not be showcased or exploited with adult accoutrements. Just more of the adult beauty pageant syndrome being directly/indirectly forced upon easily impressionable children. Even the beauty of the moving body could be better appreciated without superficial and overbearing elaborate pageant costuming.
(2.) It provided no information on judging criteria or the results as they were being tabulated either in real time or afterwards or the names of contestants. Interviews with judges would have helped. Only provided their numbers and unless you were memorizing numbers with faces or names it was of little help.
(3.) Often with no names, unless you're good at memorizing faces even before all the makeup, wigs and elaborate costume changes, it became difficult to follow who's who.
(4.) Little background on the coaches, judges and the contest organization. Trying to find information on the web about the history and past winners was nearly impossible. One important site was even hacked and was down.
(5.) I never saw a date for the contest but was able to figure out that the DVD producers had time to give us an update on contestants a year later as an addendum to the credits. Such followups make a contestant more than just a snapshot in time. Even the DVD producers own website gave no followup. Never did find out why some of the Russian girls were denied visas. The Scots must have thought they were terrorists. Sad!
(6.) Camera angles and jump around editing resulted in a disjointed loss of the beauty, grace and intricacies of this dance as art.",1334102400,5,1848,4.980582524271845

Everything from the dresses and wigs and the injuries and physical therapy to the practices in hotel conference rooms brought back so many memories for me. JIG was such a pleasure to watch and I will own it on DVD as soon as possible.

This is not a movie for people who want to learn to irish dance. It is a story about what irish dancing is like at the highest level. And although Riverdance and the other shows are good, you'll never see more talent anywhere else besides World Championships. Competitions are not about being flashy or sexy, they're about the dancing, which is how it should be, and JIG did an excellent job of showing that.",1325980800,8,949,4.386363636363637

1. Not just the dvd but the film in general - there really should be more explanation about the World's scoring. This was extremely confusing, even for an Irish dancer (though one that hasn't been to Worlds).  When I showed it to friends, they kept asking 'what's going on? What are they talking about?)
2. The dvd comes with nothing. Zip, zero, nada.  If you want the special features, buy Blu-Ray.  I wish I had paid attention to that fact when I bought it, but I was already grimacing at spending the money on a basic dvd.

My friends that know I love Irish dance, watched the movie with me.  Some seemed to enjoy it, some just wanted to humor me. Those that did other types of competitive dance, liked it for comparison, and to laugh (or compare) to the intensity of it all.  I really do like it, and would watch it again, but I want to provide an honest perception for those who may not have an Irish dance background.

4570131,5,B0054PSXZK,"Review By Benji Wilson published in The Daily Telegraph on 01 Sep 2011

************************************************************************
Remember the time when Britain lost its collective mind and Riverdance was popular? It only lasted for a year or two, but in that short period of mass cultural sedation, Michael Flatley became a celebrity and the world became aware of Irish dancing.

Then, like so many epoch-making artistic phenomena, all of that bizarre high-kicking and leg-shaking - like someone had scattered drawing pins around the Ministry of Silly Walks - went back to wherever it had come from and we all felt a bit embarrassed at the CDs in the car.

That, at least, was my position on Irish dancing before Jig: the Great Irish Dance-Off, an absolutely extraordinary documentary on BBC Two last night. I now recant in total shame, and accept squarely on the chin whatever brickbats Irish dance-loving readers choose to throw at me. Irish dancing, at least the competitive bit of it, is a hop, skip and a jump better than any other sport ever invented; at the very least it knocks last summer's football World Cup into a cocked hat. All it took, as in the best traditions of documentary making, was someone to tell us about it.

Jig followed a group of contestants in the lead up to the World Irish Dancing Championships in Glasgow last year, with the keyword being ""World"" - not only was this another world, it was another world that exists all over the world. All ages and nations were here, including a Russian female troupe (technically awesome but they looked miserable), an 18-year-old American whose parents had moved to Britain from California to fulfil his talent, and Sandun, the flying Dutchman, a Sri Lankan teenager adopted by Dutch parents who lives in Rotterdam and is an Irish dancer.

Best of the bunch, perhaps inevitably, were the two 10-year-old girls Brogan and Julia. Like Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding, or Senna and Prost, they were immediately set up as two combatants coming from different sides of the tracks. Julia was the pre-programmed rich kid from New York, Brogan the earthily sweet Irish girl who was doing it for her dead grandmother.

""Brogan is very nice,"" said Julia, who, like many 10 year-olds, was also very nice, ""even though she keeps beating me.""

Jig took unusual subject matter but its treatment of it was completely unoriginal. Luckily, the two films it most closely resembled in structure and intent, the basketball film Hoop Dreams, and the spelling contest Spellbound, are two of the greatest documentary films ever made. First, open a window on an unknown world. Second, deal with triumph and disappointment, ideally distilled into as short a moment as possible, as with a trial or competition. Third, ditch the voice-over. No, not even Stephen Fry. And finally, film children with their parents as much as possible. For some reason this seems to provide almost intravenous access to the perils of the modern human condition.

It's a winning formula and Jig applied it to perfection, but there was more. Producer and director Sue Bourne has a wonderful eye for telling detail, the cut-in shot that's more insightful than the main one, the static tableaux that does more than a voice-over prompt ever could. There was so much delicious footage that you sensed at times that Bourne didn't know what to leave out. She solved this by not leaving anything out; Jig was an hour and a half long.

We saw our subjects on the street involuntarily going through their steps, like the dole queue scene in The Full Monty. We saw parents living every step of their child's routine from the auditorium, twitching maniacally as if they were undergoing shock treatment. And we saw countless low-level shots of feet: feet moving with astonishing speed, feet in mid-air, but always feet independent of heads, which, in many ways, is what Irish dancing is about.

I said earlier that Irish dancing is a sport. I would have disagreed with that statement before seeing Jig, but every element that makes sport our mass modern theatre was in place. The less talented obsessives, the lazy divine talents, the pushy parents, the hard-knuckle coaches (one of whom stated that she'd rather her own child could dance than read or write), the inscrutable master-pupil relationship between a coach and his or her star.

The brilliance of this film was to pick out all of these sporting tropes from what looked to the untrained eye like a Shirley Temple convention. It was an unforgettable disjunction, at once completely stupid and profound.

And, TV being what it is, Jig surely must have repercussions. We await the ""My Big Fat Irish Dance-Off"" explosion. Maybe Michael Flatley will be given a slot on Strictly. But until that bandwagon starts rolling, memories of Jig will suffice. When, at the end, Brogan hugged Julia on the podium - in consolation or congratulation? I won't spoil it for those readers who will now be rushing to watch it on the BBC iPlayer - heartstrings were not so much tugged as wrenched out completely.

4570132,4,B0054PSXZK,"Gordon Sullivan, DVD Verdict --Jig examines the phenomena of Irish step dancing not by focusing on its most public faces--Riverdance and Lord of the Dance--but by going to the 40th annual Irish Dancing World Championships held in Glasgow, Scotland, in 2008. The film follows a number of families as their children compete for the medal. The documentary is about equally balanced between giving audiences an overview of the dancing and documenting the drama of the competition proper.

Those who've seen Riverdance or Lord of the Dance might think they know Irish dancing. To a certain extent, they do. Many of the basic moves are shared between traditional Irish dancing and its popular counterparts. However, the difference between competition dancing and something like Riverdance is the difference between a martial arts demonstration and a real live fight. Much of the more flowery hand movements are eliminated--since solo dancers keep their arms rigidly at their sides--and the emphasis is on the feet: their control, their timing, and their ability to make movements that civilians can barely follow, let alone perform. That's the chief virtue of Jig--it provides a nice counterpoint to other Irish dance offerings by giving audiences a peek at a ""purer"" form of the activity. Director Sue Bourne does a really effective job bouncing between wide shots of dancers and closeups of the intricate patterns woven by their feet. Those sequences--when we watch dancers do their thing--are the film's most effective and those who enjoy the more popular forms of the dance will certainly appreciate these moments.

The film's other main virtue is its narrative drive; we learn about Irish dancing from real dancers and their families. The world of Irish dance--not unlike many other competition-oriented subcultures--has its own brand of strangeness. In addition to the long hours required to learn the basic moves, Irish dance aspires to a certain archetypal ""look"" that requires elaborate dress that flows with the dancers, and well-done hair or wigs to have curls that bounce in time to the music. To most spectators (and I speak from personal experience), it just looks neat, but the agony of choosing a dress, finding a way to pay for it, and doing hair and makeup before a show is intense. Jig captures this backstage world of dance faithfully, not shying away from the strangers aspects (like fake tans), but not trying to turn the dancers into freaks. The film's tagline emphasizes the perfection dancers must strive for, and the film does a good job documenting their sometimes-obsessive search for that elusive extra something that their dancing lacks--even, of course, when it appears perfect to the audience.

Jig comes to DVD after a stint on television overseas in a nice and bright 1.78:1 anamorphic transfer. This is a clean, well-saturated presentation of the film. It's not a mind-blowing film from a visual perspective, but this DVD is clean and clear of compression or authoring problems. The Irish music (always one of the best parts of the dancing) comes out of the 5.1 surround track with impressive presence, and it's well-balanced with the film's dialogue. Extras are sadly nonexistent for this release. I would have liked some cut scenes, maybe some more interview material, especially with cultural historians or those not directly tied to the dance world itself.

8456842,4,B0054PSXZK,"This documentary focuses on children and young adults who are training for the World Irish Dancing Championships.  The ""Worlds"" in this film was in Glasgow, Scotland.  (It will be there again this year.  Cities bid for it.) The children filmed are in Ireland, England, Scotland, Holland and the United States.  One family moved from California to England so their teenage son could have better training.  The kids are really into it, as are their parents.  It's not an inexpensive activity, and the females must wear elaborate costumes and wigs when competing during their 3-minute routines.  Males don't have to wear wigs or such expensive outfits.

A group of young adult women dancers from Moscow are also filmed both in their country and at the event.  There are some very pretty locality shots in this movie, especially one in Moscow.  The young dancers work so hard and practice so much, hoping to win at the ""Worlds"".  The film can be a bit confusing at times during the contest, however, as to who did well or not, although it's very clear with the boys and the youngest girls.  Also, sometimes the dialogue can be hard to understand, especially in the beginning of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jig/dp/B011NNITW8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jig</a>, and the closed captions are far behind the spoken words.

8456845,3,B0054PSXZK,"Purchased based on price and our love of step dancing, this was mildly enjoyable. It follows the progress of several youngers to a national competition. Some of the kids clearly enjoyed dancing, some enjoyed competing and some seemed, frankly, extorted by pushy parents who taked freely about the amount of money and energy they were spending. Give there's not much actual dancing in the video, this is really more about the competition than the actual dancing.",1487894400,,461,5.078947368421052
