8354683,5,B0027G38DQ,"4bia See Prang aka 4bia or ""Phobia"" is a horror anthology (or portmanteau) film from Thailand released in 2008. A sequel ""Phobia 2"" or ""5 Prang"" was released the following year. 4bia is divided into four separate stories involving ghosts and evil spirits: ""Happiness,"" ""Tit For Tat,"" ""In the Middle,"" and ""The Last Fright."" Below are the synopses and my thoughts on these different stories. Note that there is no bookend or wraparound story, although the stories are linked to each other in tenuous and alluding ways.

""Happiness"" The movie gets a great start with this tale of a lonely young woman who texts with her friends and strangers while she sits in her small apartment. She is confined there thanks to a leg cast and she struggles to move around. Her texting to a strange young man leads to terror and danger. This is a wonderfully thrilling tale and the best part of the movie as there is a bit of cleverness and a lot of tension in the story's exposition.

""Tit For Tat"" This is a story about a group of cruel and petty bullies who torment a teen they claim snitched and caused their suspensions from school. The bullied teen is the son of an undertaker, who confronts his tormentors with a black magic spell. Things go wrong and a lot of gore ensues. This is not a poor segment but one cannot be distracted by some of the poor CGI representations of the supernatural elements.

""In the Middle"" Four young friends take a trip into the wilderness as they kayak, camp and tell anecdotes and discuss (and spoil) movies. When an accident occurs, it appears everyone survives...or is one of their buddies a ph'i(wraith)? This segment has a good deal of humor and some creepiness. It is a fairly good story.

""The Last Flight"" A very pretty flight attendant is requested to be the servant to members of a royal family on a private flight. Is this because she served them well in the past or rumors that she had a relationship with the prince? Well, tragedy occurs on the flight and the next night this flight attendant is put on a flight which could be her last. This is a really well made segment and the make-up and sets were very well done.

Overall, this is a really well-made horror movie that has the added bonus of showing the beauty of Thailand from Bangkok to the rivers to the people via troubled and tormented characters. The special effects are good at times but very poor at others and that takes back from the movie, but the acting and writing were solid all around. This is a movie worth seeing if you can find it. I cannot guarantee that this film will engage your ""phobias,"" but I found it very entertaining.",1341964800,,2890,4.83030303030303
8354684,4,B0027G38DQ,"Four scary shorts (although at least one is played for laughs), with the first and last segments having a pretty nice punch to them.  Definitely one of the above average representatives from Thai cinema.  Horror fans will find the film well worth their time.",1294963200,,258,4.840909090909091
