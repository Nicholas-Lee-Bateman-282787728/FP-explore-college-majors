This version was a fraction of the price, but the English translation wasn't the same (or as good), so we returned it.",1220918400,3,249,4.636363636363637
8174987,2,B000N5MYHY,"I had the same problems as the previous review.  The subtitles from chapter 33 on seem to be done by a different translater.  Name references were totally different from the first 32 chapters.  The ""F"" word reference also started from chapter 33.  I bought these DVD's because the TV series sold me on the character and moral samples which I thought I could show my grandchildren.  I was greatly disappointed.  I am currently pursuing a full refund.",1183075200,3,449,4.766233766233766
8174988,3,B000N5MYHY,"My mom's visiting me here in the US and she got hooked on to this series while watching TV. We are from India and the only way she can tell what's going on is from the English subtitles.

I decided to get her this box set for her birthday and she's thrilled with it.

The only problem is that some of the DVDs have competely meaningless subtitles. No, I don't mean bad grammar (which incidentally is true of all the subtitles in this set - the subtitles aren't as good as the ones that come on TV). Some DVDs have a random gathering of english words for subtitles. One of them even has, get this, f*** thrown in. Obviously somebody has played a prank... they probably figured that the viewership was limited to east asia (the set also has chinese and japanese subtitles)... but I guess they were wrong.

I am trying to see if I can get the bad subtitled DVDs exhanged from the vendor at all. If I cant, I'd have to make this review 1 star.",1181779200,5,939,4.23463687150838
