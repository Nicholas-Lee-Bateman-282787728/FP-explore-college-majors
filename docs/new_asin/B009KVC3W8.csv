5346070,5,B009KVC3W8,Highly recommend if you're interested in this system.  Far better explanations and demonstrations than the previous dvd.  Seeing ball flights with cause and effect descriptions clearly illustrate their techniques.,1368921600,7,213,6.310344827586207
5346071,5,B009KVC3W8,"The Stack and Tilt DVD is the best golf instruction video I have ever seen. Below is my review of the Stack and Tilt Swing book. But I think the DVD is even better, especially for the visual learners out there.

I have read numerous golf books from ""Five Lessons"", to the ""Golfing Machine"" and for me The Stack and Tilt swing works and does so in 5 easy steps! Probably the biggest issue with recreation golfers is that they do not make contact with the ground in the same place every time (i.e. in front of the ball). The Stack and Tilt golf swing solves this problem and it only requires a minimum amount of practice. Case in point, for me to get more consistent contact I simply focus on straightening my back leg on the backswing and taking my hands inside. The result is my swing bottoms out in front of the ball and I hit a draw that goes 10-15 yards longer than my `conventional' swing. If I want to draw or hook the ball more, all I do is take my hands inside even more. If I hit the ball thin, I focus on straightening my back leg and getting a little more weight forward. It is amazing how easy this is to do.

Recently, I was on the range hitting balls with the Starter at my golf course and he asked me what I thought he needed to do to hit the ball higher and father. I simply had him setup with more weight on his front foot, straighten his back leg on the back swing and move his hands inside. Within 10 swings he was hitting the ball higher, father and with a draw! He told me a week later that he broke 85 for the first time in 10 years and all his buddies want me to help them.

Mike and Andy understand the mechanics of the golf swing extremely well. They also are able to explain the Stack and Tilt golf swing in terms that are easy to understand, easy to follow and easy to execute. Spend 30 minutes on the range going through the 5 easy steps of the Stack and Tilt swing and find out for yourself.",1367107200,11,1919,4.084880636604774
8542677,5,B009KVC3W8,"The DVD's are phenomenal for the beginning Stack and Tilt golfer. Years of slices and straight pulls can be reversed in several weeks and you DO NOT need to be a world class athlete to do so. Traditionalists bash the S & T method despite the historic similarities to some of the greatest golf swings in history. I don't care if you buy the videos or not, but if you slice the ball constantly by leaving weight on the back foot and swinging outside-in you're doing yourself a disservice by not investigating the Stack and Tilt swing. I'll never go back to the traditional ""weight shift"" crap shoot.",1475107200,,597,4.537037037037037

8542684,5,B009KVC3W8,"I have to admit. I 'looked into' stack and tilt 6 months ago when I decided to get back in the game. I was a high school player but took almost 10 years off of the game. I have decided to get back into it and play competitively again. I looked into different schools of thought on the swing and wanted to learn as much as I could this time around instead of how I played when I was younger. Initially, the people on TV and the internet convinced me that Stack and Tilt would be bad for me. It would be bad for my game and bad for my body. I believed them.

Fast-forward to a few days or a week ago when I decided to give them a chance after reading some good reviews of this newer DVD.

After watching only the first 30 minutes of this DVD it became painfully obvious how the 'stack and tilt system,' mike, and andy have been undeservingly maligned by popular commentators, television personalities, and subsequently the uninformed golfing public. These guys are fantastic! They are excellent communicators, seem to be kind and friendly, and their knowledge of ball flight laws and the swing is not only extensive but is quite easily verifiable by incorporating just a couple of the things they teach into your swing.

After watching the entire DVD set and then going back and watching youtube videos or videos at RotarySwing.com (where I am a member) I began to shudder at some of the things the other pros were teaching. All of a sudden I would hear another pro say something crazy like ""roll your wrists over to release the club a little more and sooner if you want to hit a big draw"" and realize how completely ridiculous that sounds when you understand the swing and ball flight like Mike and Andy explain in this DVD set.

I could go on, and on, and on about all of the things I learned from this DVD that I had wrong even after years of playing very competent golf and immediately took to the course to obtain more control over my shot shape and trajectory and have more predictability in ball flight from driver to wedge. Missed shots make more sense to me now and reviewing video of myself is suddenly a productive endeavor.

I highly, highly recommend you purchase and absorb these DVDs. I will watch them 10-15 times they are so concentrated with awesome information. The only 'downside' is that a significant portion is simply swings and trackman numbers. The super-golf-nerd like myself will really enjoy this but a beginner or simply 'interested but not dedicated' person would probably do better reading the book or just watching the 1st two DVDs in this set. I hope you enjoy these DVDs as much as I have.",1395100800,8,2621,4.486373165618448
8542685,5,B009KVC3W8,"Mike and Andy are by far the most knowledgeable golf instructors I have been exposed to. Their "" ten words"" to describe the things that all good players do is brilliant. The videos are very helpful. If you want to learn to draw the ball, this book is it.",1394323200,2,254,4.204081632653061
8542686,5,B009KVC3W8,Thought the DVD was great. Really opened my eyes to ball flight laws and how to hit different shots with out changing your swing except ball position and club face angle,1380672000,,169,4.483870967741935
