4383938,5,B004I4D6O6,"Great Job on Behalf of compositor.  These shows are culled from what must be various sources.  Unfortunately, CBS does not see fit to collect all of these themselves and market them.  Probably due to royalties for the multitude of actors found in these performances as well as other factors.  Same reason we will never see the Beatles cartoons legitimately released.  Pity we must resort to gathering these and selling them in such a manner as they are very much worthy of listening to.  Given that circumstance, we are stuck with varying format and quality which is what we have here. The makers of this product must have gone to great lengths to painstakingly assemble all 1399 shows.  I think that is amazing.  If you are a great fan of this show, you probably know many are available free at various websites.  By many, I mean as many as 150 in one place.  Guess what?, even the biggest collection online of about 150 is still only about 10% of all that exist!  Just break down and buy this.  The price is amazing and the efforts of the maker will be greatly appreciated by any fan of CBSRMT. The files are consistently named with broadcast date and title of the show.  This will be immensely important for managing the number of files you will get.  Sound level varies, some include commercials and news reports (but that adds to the charm and dating of the show - one talks about President Nixon and Watergate!).  You can still edit those out with software programs if you really want to. For the price they charge for this, you can't complain about these factors though.  Purchase and enjoy.",1313193600,19,1598,4.613475177304965

My favorite episode from that was Sorry Wrong Number . Yes a must buy for old radio fans. It tells everything about mystery theater. E.G Marshel stayed with the seasons till
The last year season which was till 1982. Then Tammy Grimes took over till the end of that year. Keeping the same format with the creeky door the door closed at its final episode New Year's Eve of 1982 . I'm

I remember trying to record some of them to keep, but doing so was futile.  When I was old enough to be able to afford to record them, the FM radio station I received used to fade in and out, sometimes for minutes at a time.

Needless to say, to be able to find the complete series from someone who makes them affordable is great!  The company took the time to carefully put them together and present them in a nice package.

4383954,4,B004I4D6O6,"This set takes me back to when I was a kid listening to radio programs.  All 1399 episodes are here with some bonus material.

Some of the episodes have the commercials and news edited out, others have them included.  Some of the commercials are telling of the time - asking for American books to be sent overseas to counteract the Russians sending books with their communist agenda - and some of the commercials are timeless - stay tuned for a new weight loss program.  The news takes you back to the time of the oil crisis and Watergate.

The content of the mysteries are interesting, especially when you consider that typically it is 3 - 6 people sitting around microphones painting a story with their words.  Business executives have affairs with their secretaries as if by simply agreeing to work for an older married executive the young lady was also resigned to sleeping with him and then falling in love, or vice versa.  I will contend that very little of that actually took place but because of the popular promotion of such, intraoffice adulterous romances between the powerful married man and the powerless female underling became accepted as common, happens every day.  It opens your eyes to what is being pushed today in popular culture.  How much gay sex is actually taking place now, for instance?

Other common content includes romances where the lady falls in love with the man for his money.

Still there are twists and you need to pay attention, unlike television.

All the files are MP3.  The discs play well on my computer but the format does not work on the CD player in my car.  I think I just have to copy them onto an MP3 disc to play on the road.  I have loaded several on my phone and listened to them that way too.

I should have limitless entertainment for a very cheap price.  It shipped quickly and even had a personal hand written note from the seller.  Thank you for putting this together.",1379289600,4,1922,4.586510263929619

This is excellent for the price.  I wouldn't have any trouble recommending this collection of CBS RADIO MYSTERIES.

I pick up my grandkids at the elementary school everyday and I have a 35 to 45 minute wait between the time I get there and they get out of school.  This will be perfect to listen to.

I grew up in the 1970's in New York City, and would listen to RMS each night in bed with my transistor under the covers!  I especially love the RMS episodes that feature nostalgic news and commercials from my home market (WWOR) and I am looking forward to finding a few of those!

This package did the job great.  I transfer 40 files at a time to a thumb drive that lives in my car stereo and I get to listen to Radio Mystery Theater everywhere I go.  Very nostalgic.

4383966,5,B004I4D6O6,"I was very happy when I did a search on Amazon and discovered that the original episodes of the CBS Mystery Theatre radio shows are available on CD. The first time I listened to this show on the radio was sometime in 1979 and from that time on I was hooked! I was in high school back then but enjoyed mystery murder and horror type television shows. These 4 CDs contain all 1,399 episodes of the radio show that ran most nights from 1974-1982. Now I have a chance to hear all the shows which I missed.

This set includes 4 disks which contain all 1,399 episodes. However, there is one thing that buyers should be aware of before purchasing this set. The disks play well on a computer when inserted in the CD Drive (E-drive). However, they won't run on my standalone DVD player. I am a mathematician not a computer geek, therefore am not sure why this happens.  It may be the case that the CDs in the set are not compatible with my DVD player. Just think this is worth mentioning.",1339632000,24,979,4.315217391304348
4383967,5,B004I4D6O6,"Considering how impossible it would be to find all 1,399 free episodes on the Internet, this 4-DVD mp3 collection is really an EXCELLENT deal!  Before discovering this DVD set here on Amazon, I had spent countless hours searching for downloadable episodes, and after literally weeks of searching, I managed to find only about 350 episodes.  I really had no idea there were nearly 1,400 episodes available! Though as others have pointed out, the audio quality varies widely (from poor to very good). But hey, your getting SO MANY episodes here, that you can simply skip an episode that is not up to your audio standards and not miss is whatsoever.

Now as far as the actual episodes are concerned, I have determined the following statistics.  Keep in mind however, I of course have not ""listened"" to all 1,399 episodes, but I am merely making a general assessment from listening to about 100 of the episodes so far. For even if I listened to one episode per day, it would still take me close to 4 YEARS to listen to them all! (Quite the bargain when you consider the price).

Anyway, I transferred all 1,399 episodes onto my computer and then arranged them by ""duration"" (track length).  (This can be done on a Windows computer by: Right-clicking within the folder containing the mp3 tracks, then selecting ""View"" then ""Details"", then right-clicking on the displayed ""details menu bar"" and adding ""Duration"" as an additional column).  I immediately noticed that the tracks varied in length from about 40-60 minutes. I later learned that this is because some shows have had all the newsbreaks & commercials edited out, and others have left some, or evan ALL of them in (which would be the full/original 1-hour show).

So, if you enjoy the ""nostalgic factor"" of listening to the old-time news briefs (at the beginning of the show), plus the 3-5 commercial breaks, then you will want to load your MP3 player with the tracks that are only 47 MINUTES AND LONGER.  But, if you want to listen to the SHOW ONLY, (with NO interruptions), then you will want to load your MP3 player with the tracks that are only 46 MINUTES AND SHORTER. Again, this is just a general assessment, for it would take a lot of listening to determine an ""exact"" dividing line.

Therefore, according to the above figures, there are 'around' 271 shows that CONTAIN a varied mixture of news and/or commercials... and around 1,128 shows that are FREE from all news/commercial breaks.  I honestly can't imagine someone editing out all the news/commercial breaks from over 1,100 episodes, but to whomever did this, THANK YOU!!  I say this because even though the nostalgic factor of listening to the mid-70's news briefs & commercials is initially very interesting, I must admit that after awhile, it becomes more of a minor annoyance than anything, especially the long commercial interruptions between each of the ""3 acts"" of a great suspense story.  But that is just my own opinion, for I can definitely still appreciate the nostalgic value of a mid-70's news break.

Plus, a previous reviewer mentioned that the volume level differs between shows, in some cases quite dramatically...this is true.  But there is a free program available that can solve this problem. This program will ""level-out"" all the tracks to a customizable db level (listening volume). Mind you, the program does NOT alter the original track's frequency data/code whatsoever, but merely analyzes and levels-out the entire track to a specific volume (db) level.  (This is a great program for your MP3 music collection as well, in which it will level-out your large mp3 collections to a equal listening volume). Just do a Google search for: ""Soundforge mp3 Gain""...it should be the first hit, located at ""soundforge. net"".  I've been using the program for over 4 years now, and even sent a $5 PayPal donation to the programmer, for it has been a great mp3 tool for an audio enthusiast like myself.

I have found that adjusting these 1,399 old tracks to 95.5db works well, and about 92.5db seems to be a nice ""non-aggressive"" ""sweet spot"" for all your other mp3 music.  The difference being is that these old-time radio tracks are sometimes ""muffled"" recordings, so they are better heard at a higher db level.  You can pretty much ignore the ""clipping"" warning at these suggested db levels, for it is a VERY ""sensitive"" warning, and would be extremely difficult for the human ear to detect any difference in the sound quality.  The clipping warning could simply mean that 1/100th of a second of a single frequency spike got slightly clipped...which is not a big deal, even for an hard-core audiophile like myself.  With all that said about this program, if you use it, I would humbly suggest processing only about 150 of these very long radio tracks at a time between computer reboots.  For to batch-process all 1,399 tracks at once (which is a whopping 14GB of total data) would be a MASSIVE project for a computer's limited RAM to handle all at once. But, every computer is different, so it's just a suggestion.  ;)

Anyway, I hope this information was helpful.

And the news updates + commercials included in many of the episodes representing that day of nostalgia that were not stripped out are a great bonus in my opinion.

This series brings back fond memories.

I listened to all 1,399 of these episodes over the past few years. Several dozen are inaudible. So poorly recorded, they can't be heard. Others are poorly recorded but still audible. And many are just fine.

If this set contains 1,399 episodes from the CBS-RMT site, then a dozen of the original broadcasts are MISSING from this set. I say this because while the CBS-RMT site has 1,399 episodes, I found another site that has a dozen or so which the CBS-RMT site does not.

It sounds like these episodes were taped by fans in the 1970s when they originally played, and then collected at the CBS-RMT website. Many of the episodes contain the original commercials or news broadcasts of the day, and many do not. The radio station promos (which can also be heard) indicate that they've been recorded from stations all across America.

ADDENDUM (3/1/18): After three years (it's taken this long to listen to most of it), I am downgrading my rating to 1 star (I originally gave it three stars) because overall, the quality isn't very good.  It sounds like (for some episodes at least) that this was recorded in someone's den with phones ringing in the background and conversations taking place with no effort to keep their voices down.  I just listened to an episode that sounded like a good one; I missed much of it because of excess background noise in the recording.

Instead, what I received were 6 Verbatim DVD-Rs scrawled in ink with the name of the program. Looks like the seller (or someone) just burned these from wherever they got the shows from. While I'm glad to have the shows all in one place, I am disappointed that this isn't a package that was done by an actual company instead of someone with a DVD Burner. It would've been nice to have had it accompanied by an episode guide with descriptions of the shows and other information relating to them. Probably won't happen any time soon. While I'm not disappointed by the quality of the recordings themselves, I am a bit upset that this is being sold without anything anywhere stating that this is not an official release and that you won't be getting anything but the discs themselves and the case shown as advertised.",1421020800,4,1167,4.457943925233645
