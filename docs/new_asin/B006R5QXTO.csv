Lan Kwai Fong is Hong Kong's nightlife district. This movie definitely milks sexual stereotypes to the hilt. The guys are dashing metrosexuals and the girls of the long legged, mini skirted, long flowing tresses and sexy variety. And they all seemingly got tons of money to burn.

Everyone goes by a singular name only (real or devised). I enjoyed this as the characters are having a great time clubbing. The guys are out to score and the girls are out to (as they say in Cantonese) catch big fish - meaning land a rich beau. If you can't wait to get home for the nasty, there's the club restrooms or the car on the street.

Steven (Chen Zhiming) and Jennifer (Shiga Lin), starts off with a one night stand but soon the relationship develops into something more serious. Along the way their love is tested by some misunderstandings, so will there be a happy ending?

Bar manager Jacky ((Jason Chan) gets his girlfriend Mavis pregnant and ditches her as he's more keen on Jeana (He Peiyu). Mavis unsuccessfully slits her wrists and becomes a high class call girl. Jacky then realises he still cares for her.

I was prepared for a dud but on the whole Lan Kwai Fong is very breezy. The parade of glamorous people and lots of sex helped, and it had a very simple love story. Comedic moments come in the form of a dyke hitting on girls and a rich couple Sean (Wang Zong Yao) and Cat (Chen Jing) getting married at the bar in their undies. Plus the clubby music put me in the mood.

Wilson Chin directs. Warning: this film is not for the analytical.
