Oval Portrait:

It seems some of Poe's classics should not be made into film. In this tale a family gets together for the reading of a will at a house that appears to be haunted by the ghost of Rebecca, whose oval portrait appears on the wall. The haunting effects are poor, as in turning a camera on/off poor, something that dates from the 1920's. We do find out about Rebecca which consumes much of the film.

Originally released in 1972 as ""One Minute Before Death."" It has a low budget Mexican feel to it. The acting wasn't great either.

Parental guide: No f-bombs, nudity, or sex between two living people.

Devil's Daughter:

Nothing like a bad Italian combination of ""Rosemary's Baby"" plus ""The Wrath of Khan"" to make for a low intensity boring film. The beginning of the film opens with evil satanic bikers killing i.e sacrificing some desert hippies. It then jumps to 1991 Frankfort where a Van Helsing looking guy (Herbert Lom) sticks a bug up a school teacher's (Kelly Curtis) nose. Very long. Very boring. Not well acted. There are better ways to spend your time and money.

Released under the title ""La setta.""

PARENTAL GUIDE: F-bomb, sex, nudity.",1350604800,,1250,4.599099099099099
8214138,5,B000UO9AA2,"I purchased this DVD about three years ago when I searched Amazon.com to see if there was a release of Director Michele Soavi's third Horror film 'THE DEVIL'S DAUGHTER' aka 'THE SECT' aka 'LA SETTA'- 1991 and this selection came up.  The company is EastWest DVD and it looks like they took the old VHS pre-record copy which I think was distributed by Lionsgate and transfered it onto DVD with digital sound.  Its full screen with adequate color and , unfortunately ,the only release at present.  The mind boggles that not one major company has picked up this excellent title to give it a proper release.  This film shows Soavi honing his craft and has excellent performances by Kelly Curtis and Herbert Lom which may be his final film. It has a great score by Pino Donaggio and is produced and co written by Dario Argento who collaborated with Soavi on his early project 'THE CHURCH' aka ' LA CHIESA'-1989 and emerges as an ahead of its time thriller involving religious cults persisting to this day. Soavi would not direct another film till 1994 which would be his masterpiece 'CEMETERY MAN' aka 'DELLAMORTE DELLAMORE' before retreating from filmmaking to care for his sons illness and emerging back into the breach with some excellent Italian Television productions.  The other film on this double feature disc is a rare gothic romance from 1973 Director Rogelio A. Gonzalez Jr.s  'THE OVAL PORTRAIT' aka 'ONE MINUTE BEFORE DEATH' which seems to have been made by Mexican filmmakers with American actors .  This film is also culled from VHS and is in slightly better condition.  Based on a tale by Edgar Allan Poe, it resembles the gothic soap opera from the sixties 'DARK SHADOWS' before the vampire/horror overtones were introduced into its storyline. Its a surprisingly good movie with mediocre acting by Barry Coe and a final performance by Wanda Hendrix who is much too old for her role. The movie has a music score credited to Les Baxter but the themes sound like cues from his Roger Corman Poe forays and has major tracks culled from his American cut of Director Mario Bava's 'BLACK SUNDAY'-1960. The disc is worth the price and should suffice for Euro film fans till the real digital transfer of Soavi's work is released, if ever. The five stars is for Soavi's film which gains on repeated viewings and shows the talent of this underrated artist coming to fruition.",1346112000,5,2375,4.789731051344743
