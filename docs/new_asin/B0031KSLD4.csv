I still think this should have been on the Lost Broadcast DVD since it is only 26  minutes long but I only paid half price so thats the story in part.  It is nice to have this since I seem to becoming a complete ist in regards to Yes.
Great to see them young and at the beggining.",1304985600,,322,3.7205882352941178
8387068,5,B0031KSLD4,"After 35 years of being stuck in a vault somewhere, these videos are back showing Yes in its early years. A wonderful time capsule for hardcore Yes fans! 4 terrific music videos, plus a little snippet of Chris Squire doing a silly comic routine. This is a real treat for us who love all the classic Yes music of 1970. These 4 videos are for songs from their first 2 lps. The video quality is decent, and considering how old these videos are, we are quite lucky to have them at all!",1303603200,,481,4.239130434782608
8387069,2,B0031KSLD4,"While I enjoyed the novelty of seeing these videos for the first time, it was a bit of a disappointment to realize what they were.

These videos (films) are of The Yes Album band (meaning Steve instead of Peter), playing tunes from the Time And A Word album (meaning Peter, not Steve).  And when I say ""playing"" I mean lip-synching in the studio.  Or in the street or on a boat...  They don't even pretend to have microphones or have their equipment plugged in.

I would have loved to have heard this line-up actually playing these tunes.  It's clear that Steve is playing something entirely different from what you hear, which is just the original album versions.  If that weren't possible I would have liked to have seen Peter on screen (particularly with live-in-the-filming-studio audio tracks, even if it were of poorer quality.)

O.K.  I might be wrong about ALL of the tracks as I haven't bothered to watch the last one, but I'm guessing it's from the same source.

On the up side, the film transfer quality is very good and clean.  So it's a fun way to see Our Heroes in their early 20's.

So it's an interesting set, but definitely not for the casual fan.",1294272000,5,1164,4.543269230769231
