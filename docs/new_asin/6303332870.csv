The soundtrack is excellent. The storyline holds your interest. The characters are real.

At the end of the 1960s, Scott and Ralph, two college kids from a stuffy, upper-middle class suburban town, decide to spend the summer on the road, living out of their van and experiencing all the freedom the counterculture(Hippie)has to offer. Family conflicts and the harsh realities of the war in Vietnam, however, interfere with their idyll. Scott's older brother, who Scott self-rightously criticized for going to war, is reported missing in action and then comes home in a casket. Then Ralph is arrested for stealing his file from the draft board to avoid duty. Before their ""last summer of innocence"" is over, Scott and Ralph learn that there's more to being radicals than just drop out and tuning in.

Two college students try to hitchhike their way home. A man in a white car stops for them, its a mistake. The sun sets. There is an Easter sunrise service. Scotts brother is a Marine. They argue in the garage. Alden departs, his leave has ended. Some go to college to avoid the draft (the privileges of the rich). There is a demonstration on campus, security guards club students. Later they drive a Corvair along the highway and pick up hitchhikers. Beth speaks about the war at graduation ceremonies. Ralph takes LSD then strips in public. He is chased. They want to take him away. Whats going on? Scott paints the side of his minivan. They find a group of sunbathers. Im cutting back. Would 1969 change the world? [Yes, but not for the better.] There is a country fair. Alden is MIA. Ralph and Scott break into a building and search the files. Uncle Sam Wants You. If a paper file is destroyed will this affect their draft status?

The police arrive to search for intruders and find them. The arrest causes family problems for Scott. What will you do? Scotts mother is emotionally upset by this. Scott and Beth visit Ralph, who doesnt understand. Then they go on the road. Where are we going? They pass trucks with soldiers and flash a V-sign. Beth doesnt want to run away to Canada. Stay and fight. Later they visit a funeral for Alden, the first boy from town to die in Vietnam. Scott makes a speech, this is not a good war. What can they do about it? Scott and Beth will try to get Ralph out of jail. He invites others to walk along with them; they do. Their march through town attracts others. Ralph walks out. Scotts father shows his approval. People later marched in Washington to protest the war (November 1969).

In 1973 the movie American Graffiti was a big hit in recreating life in 1962 California. This seems like an attempt to do the same for 1969. Its not that good a story, but you may disagree. Maybe someday there will be a better movie to recreate life in that era. The Ruling Class of America escalated its war on the people. First it was the attack on the Second Amendment, later Nixon devalued the US dollar in 1971 by eliminating the gold standard. Taxes went up, wages went down, over the decades. Later NAFTA began to ship jobs offshore. Those who benefitted from using cheap labor for products sold in America prospered. The rest suffered economic inequality, lower wages and higher taxes. The 1950's and 1960's were the best of times for most Americans. Will we ever again see these good times?",1447372800,,2540,4.517391304347826

625388,5,6303332870,"1969 harkens us back to those years of peace, love, war and dissention.  Robert Downey Jr, and Keifer Sutherland play boyhood friends who have the misfortune of graduating high school during the height of the War in Vietnam.

All too often a movie's soundtrack is merely incidental music.  This is not so with 1969.  Fortunately, there was no shortage of great music to be heard.  From Cream to Moody Blues, Crosby, Still & Nash to The 5th Dimension, the soundtrack coaxed the movie along.

While we all know the outcome of the war and could easily guess how the movie would play out, it is an important piece of the history of our nation.  Never before since the secession from Great Britain had the populace of this nation been so polarized.  While only a dramatic representation, this movie serves to remind us of who we are and how we got here.",1419379200,4,848,4.569536423841059
625389,4,6303332870,"I grew up in the 60s and think it was the last time America was truly interesting.  So I love fictional takes on it.  This is a very good film, with some truly fine acting.  Sutherland is a sensitive boy from small-town Maryland, which the Vietnam conflict is finally beginning to penetrate.  His sidekick (Downey), a lifelong neighbor from a single-parent household, is falling victim to all the worst excesses of the time - protesting, turning on, dropping out.  Meanwhile, a serious young lady (a radiant Ryder in her prime) is falling for Sutherland as he tries to help her brother.  Their parents are all struggling with aging and the times.  Add to this Sutherland's straighter brother, who disappears in Vietnam, and you have a powerful mix.

I can't be too objective because this is so close to my own experience.  With the exception of a kind of cheesy ending, I found the film moving and fairly realistic, with sprinklings of the occasional cliche.  It's not Coming Home, but it is good.  Recommended.",1415664000,2,1011,4.786127167630058

625489,4,6303332870,"Here's a coming-of-age film from the 1980s that attempts to look back at the year 1969 via the clearly autobiographical reflections of writer/director Ernest Thompson. While it doesn't always succeed in truly capturing the zeitgeist of that time, occasionally lapsing into easy cliches instead, at its best it does convey much of the idealistic hope & heartbreaking fears of that pivotal year.

Keifer Sutherland is the writer's surrogate, and he does a fine job of embodying the sensitivity & bewildering of a young man embracing the best of the counterculture. There's a sincerity here that really shines, made all the more poignant because we know how harshly time will deal with it. Robert Downey, Jr., as his best friend, is a bit more problematic -- always a charismatic presence, he still seems more 1980s than 1960s & never quite seems to inhabit his role. Winona Ryder as Downey's sister & Sutherland's eventual love is sweet, innocent, impassioned -- very much a girl of that time.

The actors playing the parents are impressive: Bruce Dern & Mariette Hartley as Sutherland's conflicted family, and Joanna Cassidy as Downey's & Ryder's emotionally fraying mother, given to too-loud laughing in an effort to stave off fear & emptiness. Hartley is especially good, underplaying her role to perfection, her own fears bottled up tightly but still seeping out through the cracks in her facade.

The story itself meanders, but that's part of the film's authentic charm. I was a teenager then myself, dreading the draft just as the film's protagonists did, and that sense of foreboding feels very real & true to me. The required countercultural scenes are wisely low-keyed, rather than over-the-top; genuine hippies were much more than the one-dimensional caricatures you see in contemporary presentations.

Does it really deserve 4 out of 5 stars? That's a toss-up, to be honest. But I'm going with four stars because what it does get right is achingly honest. Besides, many of the questions it asks about war & peace, obedience to authority, and pursuing wholeness as an individual human being remain pertinent today. And as far too many want to flush that time down the memory hole, this modest film is all the more recommended!",1370822400,,2234,5.046070460704607

Were we really supposed to believe that they'd go to Canada, and what's with the hoaky ending?!?!?

625492,3,6303332870,"When I saw this movie as a teenager it was very effective for me, but
after seeing again years later I realized it's not nearly as good
as I thought I it was. The only reason to still like it is pure
Nostalgia. It's full of great actors who unfortunately aren't that
great in it. Sutherland is reviving his role from The Promised Land,
he plays pretty much the same character and Downey is playing his
character from Less Than Zero dropped off in the 60's,
(bad place for that guy to be.) they're just running over alot of the
same ground.  Ryder is just the girl. She doesn't have much to do or say
but to be the girl and be there for her man. The 60's were shovanistic
but geeze. The only other women in it, fight with ther husbands, worry
about their kids and can't wait to have sex with bruce dern??? come on!.

The affair side-plot between the adults in the movie isn't
needed and although Bruce Dern is one of my favorite actors ever,
he's not particularly effective in this.

Ultimately I think the movie is just too unfocused and filled with too
many standard 60's movies cliche's. For movies like it and for a movie
very much of it's time it isn't bad, but I certainly think that it can
still be done much better.

Also, There's no way it's worth 32 dollars!!!!! buy a vcr and get in on vhs.",1343865600,4,1300,4.251012145748988

about the same sentiments for Kiefer and Robert. Subpar.
Nothing in the movie seems very believable.
Let's see 2 friends graduate high school in late 60s, head out on the road to find themselves, vietnam draft, brother killed in action, bad acid trip, fall for friends little sister, run away to Canada, have change of heart, return home to lead fight against the war, the end. not to original of a story line and very poorly carried out.

625537,3,6303332870,"Had the producers of this movie spent a little more money on cinematography, this could have been a great movie. The acting and the storyline are superb, but the technical quality is below the standard of what a good picture should be. All the scenes shot in a shady area are darkened and have a green contrast while those shot in the sun are of much better contrast. This makes for an obvious neglect of reflected lighting to enhance the scenes shot in the shade.

 Then there is the problem of audio qualtiy where the soundtrack is not blended with the sound content of the movie. Some of the old '60s songs music used to blend in the aura of the era are hard to hear and sound as though they are coming from afar. This cuts into the quality of the screenplay to the point of absurdity.

 All things considered, this is not exactly a bad movie. The acting and the sterling cast save it from being a total waste, and the plot and storyline are believalbe and easy to follow. Had the technical quality have been up to par, this could have easily been a 5 star movie for sure. But the low-budget effect pulls it's overall rating down considerably. I will give it a 3 star for being an excellent attempt at trying to portray the social termoil associated with the Vietnam Era, but it barely makes the grade due to low-budget cinematography.",1263686400,,1338,4.426829268292683
625538,3,6303332870,"The Dawning of the Age of Aquarius? More like the yawning of the Age of Aquarius. Writer/Director Ernest Thompson has managed to make a very boring film about a year when EVERYTHING changed. There was Woodstock, but also Altamont. The My Lai massacre, and the Charles Manson Family murders. Nixon was inaugurated, and promptly began Operation Breakfast, the secret bombing of Cambodia. In court, Sirhan Sirhan admitted that he had killed presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy. James Earl Ray confessed to the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. Ted Kennedy drove off a bridge on his way home from a party on Chappaquiddick Island, Massachusetts. Mary Jo Kopechne died in the incident.

The Brady Bunch premiered on ABC. In Berkeley an empty lot owned by the University was seized to form People's Park. The Stonewall Riot in New York marked the start of the gay rights movement. Apollo 9 and Apollo 10 were launched, dry run and dress rehearsal for the planned manned moon landing. The Apollo 11 landed on the moon, soon followed by the second moon landing by Apollo 12 that same year.

David Bowie's ""Space Oddity"" was a hit, even being used by the BBC for their broadcast of the moon walk. The Stooges released their eponymously titled first album, which featured a song entitled ""1969."" Led Zeppelin released their first and second albums that year. Creedence Clearwater Revival released their second, third, and fourth albums in 1969. Jim Morrison of the Doors was arrested for allegedly exposing himself during a show in Miami. Judy Garland died of an overdose of barbiturates. Brian Jones was found dead in his swimming pool a month after leaving The Rolling Stones. Dmitri Shostakovich composed Symphony No. 14, Op. 135, for soprano, bass, string orchestra and percussion.

The Beatles gave their last public performance, on the roof of Apple Records. This impromptu concert was broken up by the police, as neighbors had complained of the noise. A film of the concert would be released entitled ""Let It Be."" The Beatles released Abby Road in 1969. In 1969 Paul married Linda and John married Yoko Ono.

Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid was the top grossing film of 1969, followed by The Love Bug. The third and fourth highest grossing films were Midnight Cowboy, which also won the Academy Award for best picture and best director, and Easy Rider. Gig Young won the Academy Award for best supporting actor in They Shoot Horses, Don't They? Bruce Dern, who plays Cliff, Scott's father in ""1969""  was also in They Shoot Horses, Don't They? as well as playing Keeg in The Cycle Savages that same year.

The film, ""1969"" is more of a personal memoir than an historical chronicle. It takes place mostly in Maryland, in a small town that hadn't caught up with the changes of the 60's, even though the decade was almost over. It does manage to capture a bit of the flavor and events of 1969, but the story doesn't really go anywhere. Focusing on two friends, Scott (Kiefer Sutherland) and Ralph (Robert Downey Jr.) they enter college, mostly to escape being drafted and sent to Viet Nam. Scott's brother does go to Nam, and leaves Scott his car, which they sell to buy a van that they paint with psychedelic designs. At Ralph's sister Beth's High School graduation Beth (Winona Ryder), the valedictorian, gives a speech opposing the war in Viet Nam. Her speech gets mixed reviews, but the reaction is more positive than the one for Ralph's impromptu performance. Overdosed on LSD he strips and announces that he has flunked out of college.

Bruce Dern plays Scott's father, Cliff. As a conservative veteran of World War II he is made to look more and more like a clown. There is a scene where they are at a school fair selling tickets to throw cream pies in Cliff's face. Scott's mother even says ""cream your father"" or did I imagine that? This is right where they learn that Scott's brother is missing in action. Does Dern ever look foolish. Foolish and sad.

I suppose the point of ""1969"" was to show how the country gradually came to believe that the war was a mistake, but it didn't work so well. A romance between Scott and Beth has zero chemistry. They flee to Canada only to turn back, but why? Instead of giving us a compelling reason to care about the characters we are given sentimental speeches that go over about as well as Beth's valedictorian speech -- or Ralph's.

Oh, well, in a film about 1969, there is plenty of good music to choose from. Though they are mentioned in the opening voice over narration, we never get to hear any Beatles. I guess Michael Jackson, who bought up their catalogue, wanted too much. There was still plenty of music from 1969 left over, and the following songs were on the soundtrack:

""Wooden Ships"" performed by Crosby Stills & Nash, written by Crosby, Stills and Paul Kantner; ""Aquarius / Let The Sun Shine In"" performed by The Fifth Dimension; ""Goin' up the Country"" performed by Canned Heat; ""Time of the Season"" performed by The Zombies, written by Rod Argent; ""Green River"" performed by Creedence Clearwater Revival, written by John C. Fogerty; ""Get Together"" performed by Jesse Colin Young; ""All Along The Watchtower"" performed by The Jimi Hendrix Experience, courtesy of Auteursrechtenmaatschappi B.V. ""ARM"", written by Bob Dylan; ""May This Be Love"" performed by The Jimi Hendrix Experience, written by Jimi Hendrix; ""When I Was Young"" performed by The Animals; ""Can't Find My Way Home"" performed by Blind Faith with Steve Winwood; ""Tuesday Afternoon"" performed by The Moody Blues, written by Justin Hayward; and last but not least, ""White Room"" performed by Cream and written by Jack Bruce and Pete Brown.

625539,4,6303332870,Thank you for the movie. Kiefer Sutherland is a great actor and always enjoy to watch his work. The movie 1969 is a good movie to watch.,1227571200,,136,4.074074074074074
625540,2,6303332870,"This movie rolls out every cliche of the coming-of-age and anti-war genres. Sensitive future writer protagonist? Check. Equally sensitive but troubled buddy? Check. Frigid [...] mom and hardass dad? Got it. Older brother shipping out, only to become cannon fodder on practically his first day in country? Yep.

(Warning: there be spoilers ahead.)

This movie feels as if it was transcribed directly from the writer/director's personal experience. That is not necessarily a good thing. The plot hits all the usual tropes - pot-smoking college students avoiding the draft, road trip in a VW van, budding romance with the best buddy's little sister. The film reaches its unlikely climax at the funeral of the previously mentioned older brother, in which Buddy's Little Sister delivers a tired anti-war sermon as if it's the first time anyone has said anything so brilliant. And to top it all off, the entire little town marches on City Hall to spring Buddy from jail (don't ask).

The only thing that saves this from a one-star rating is the cast. Keifer Sutherland is adorable as the sensitive future writer protagonist. Robert Downey Jr. plays the troubled best buddy (of course); he does what he can  but the character is written inconsistently. Why would the free-spirited draft-dodger suddenly want to return to his hometown and get a job? Winona Ryder is cute as Downey's younger sister and Sutherland's love interest. Bruce Dern, Mariette Hartley and Joanna Cassidy are okay as the parents, but some of their actions seem to be without motivation.

625544,4,6303332870,"Dopy yet captivating, 1969 wears its heart on its sleeve.  Winona Ryder has beautiful hippie outfits.  Robert Downey Jr is fascinating to watch.  His character just seems like him.  Because he always plays drugged-out losers whose worlds are about to collapse, his movies always seem to be his autogiography, just like the old time-stars like Lana Turner or John Wayne.  Yet in this film Kiefer's the real star, and he isn't bad.  With his blond, blond hair he looks very much as though he might actually have been the son of Mariette Hartley.

The anti war stuff was a little cimplified but good.  Winona makes a startling speech at her high school graduation, asking the crowd why we have to go fight a war that no one in the US actually understands.  Watching it today, we realize we should be asking ourselves these questions all over again.  I wonder if the movie might have been more of a success today than in 1988.  Ryder made this film right between BEETLEJUICE and HEATHERS, when she was still a giant star, and yet it barely saw release.

Among the elders, Bruce Dern, Mariette Hartley and Joanna Cassidy are all excellent.  Joanna Cassidy isn't as lean and mean as she is on SIX FEET UNDER, she has more flesh on her, but she looks marvelous, like Claudia Cardinale playing a hippie.

There's a scene where Sutherland's VW van, decked up in hippie colors, passes a convoy of soldier boys on a lonely highway, and Ryder leans out the window and makes the peace sign at them with a beatific smile.  At first the soldiers respond violently and obscenely and then, as more and more trucks are passed, the mood of the soldiers seems to shift and a few give the peace sign back.  Then more and more of them.  All the while on the soundtrack ""Wooden Ships"" is playing (the Jefferson Airplane version).  Some of the scenes were touching, others a little goofy.",1136160000,8,1864,4.596969696969697
625545,5,6303332870,"By now, we're used to the coming-of-age theme in movies about this era. But what makes ''1969'' special is its subtlety, in recognizing the differences in the way we reacted to news, gestures, comments in 1969 as compared to now. The term ''innocence'' is overused; it was simply one of fewer dimensions... no internet, fewer TV channels, when newspapers and radio took on a far greater role in forming our decisions. In the hitch-hiking and driving scenes through scenic Maryland, we remember that travel wasn't always comfortable, that we didn't take for granted getting from point A to point B.

Keifer Sutherland, Robert Downey Jr. and Winona Ryder are all fantastic, but Mariette Hartley really does a stellar job as a mom that keeps a family together through incredible strife.

And the soundtrack is really what'll have you hooked. There are the usual 60's staples like Blind Faith (''Can't Find My Way Home''), but also some songs younger viewers might be unfamiliar with or older ones might've forgotten (like the underrated, powerful ''When I Was Young'' by the Animals).

Not a definitive look at an era, but a likeable cast of characters that will have you coming back to watch again.",1111536000,8,1196,4.940298507462686
625546,4,6303332870,"1969 is very special to me.  I graduated from high school, went to Woodstock,  and attended every anti-war event I could find. I would be inclined to watch any movie about this period, but when this one came on ""Tivo"" as a suggestion, I was skeptical. The Tivo guide gave it two stars and suggested that it was about nothing but a couple of guys doing dope on the road.

It is actually a pretty powerful anti-war movie, with fine acting from Winona Ryder, Keifer Sutherland, and Robert Downey, Jr., who were big stars in the '80s and I am surprised this was not more of a box office hit for their presence in the cast.

The scenes are realistic, portraying the happy-go-lucky years

of hitchiking, campus protests, ""sensitivity"" and all that, and

the music is well-chosen for the most part.  I thought that there was a gratuitous homophobic scene early on, when the boys are picked up by a not-so-creepy slightly older hippie type and go ballistic, but even that scene is saved by the gay guy yelling out to them as they run away, ""I didn't know you were married!""

Scott (Sutherland) is a thoughtful individualistic boy, very typical for the time, and you get the sense that his older brother, headed for Vietnam as a Marine, is not that different, but timing is everything.  Bruce Dern as the WWII veteran father is surprisingly convincing (I thought he could only play creepy types)  The story is fairly predictable but well done.

Ryder is great playing ""Beth"" younger sister of the Downey character.  And what is it with these early Downey roles?  Art imitates life or is it vice-versa?  We see him here flipping out on LSD, running around almost naked, etc., same thing we see later in his performance as ""Julian"" in ""Less than Zero"".

He's probably the finest of the actors in this film, but this is not his best role.  I thought Sutherland did better and, what's more, looked better.  He is the star of this movie.

Too bad he is wasting his talent these days on Fox's tacky ""24"".

Anyway, in any period piece, I am always on the lookout for realism in scenes, props, characters, hairstyles, clothes, you name it.  On first viewing, I thought this film did very well on most of those counts.

Only the final scene is unrealistic.  This is supposedly set in

Maryland in the early and late summer of 1969.  That is too early for the kind of consensus to develop about the war that is depicted, especially in a small town where only one kid has died in Vietnam.  (As I write this, the same kind of feeling about the Iraq war is only apparently developing in Vermont)

I would have liked to see these characters attending Woodstock,

as that would have fit into the story well. Also, as in the NBC television series ""American Dreams"", some depiction of what the older brother was seeing going on in Vietnam would have helped immensely.  So this is not quite up there with such brilliant and moving Vietnam films as ""Platoon"" and ""Born on the Fourth of July"" or ""Forrest Gump"", but it's a fine movie and if you are anti-war and a child of the '60s, you will love it.",1109980800,20,3071,4.524500907441016
