7800910,5,1886675805,"The Boeing 727 tri-jet airliner was the second commercial aircraft model developed by the Boeing Airplane Company, following in the successful footsteps of the longer-range 707. The 707 was launched in 1954, and has now passed the 50th anniversary of its first flight (which occurred on July 15, 1954, when the prototype ""Dash 80"" model took off from Renton Field, south of Seattle, Washington).

It would take four more years, however, for the world to truly enter the ""jet age"" of commercial airline travel. The first revenue flight of a Boeing jetliner took place on October 26, 1958, when a Pan American World Airways 707 (dubbed ""Clipper America"") carried 111 passengers from New York to Paris, officially ushering in the era of commercially-available jet aircraft transportation. *

* = To be quite accurate and technical, the British-built DeHavilland ""Comet"" jetliner actually beat the Boeing 707 to the punch as the first jet aircraft to carry paying passengers in scheduled airline service. A Comet jet flew from London to New York on October 4, 1958, 22 days before the first scheduled 707 flight. The ultimate success and survival of the Comet, however, cannot even begin to compare with that of the American-made 707. Several Comets crashed shortly after the aircraft was introduced, claiming many lives in the process, thereby sealing the short-lived fate of the jetliner. Such misfortune, thankfully, was not in the cards for Boeing's four-engined 707, and it endured long after DeHavilland ended its Comet production. Many 707s are still flying as of this date, serving several cargo airlines worldwide. The same can also be said of the 727, with many of the tri-jets still in service as well.

The first B727 took to the skies on its maiden test flight on Saturday, February 9, 1963. U.S. carriers Eastern and United were the launch customers for the brand-new B727-100, with each airline beginning scheduled revenue service using the type in February 1964.

More than twenty years after entering service, the last 727 came off the Boeing assembly line (in 1984). A total of 1,832 Boeing 727s were built, making it (as of this writing) the second most successful airliner type ever manufactured. The model next in the Boeing line of jet aircraft, the twin-engined 737, has run away from the rest of the world's pack as the #1 commercial airplane in aviation history. Boeing, to date, has built and delivered more than 5,300 of the 737 models since first entering service in 1968.

An eye-opening stat regarding Boeing's workhorse, the 737 --- On average, there are 1,250 Seven-Thirty-Sevens in the air every minute of every single day around the clock! A 737 takes off from some airport on Earth approximately once every 5 seconds! Now THAT'S one heck of a successful aircraft!

This VHS video from Boston's ""Just Planes Videos"" provides a rare glimpse inside the cockpit of one of those 1,800+ Boeing 727 tri-jets, which are quickly fading from view at airports worldwide. This 75-minute video program is entitled ""Flight In The Cockpit 16"", one in a long series of 'camera-on-the-flight-deck' programs produced by JPV since 1994.

Via this videotape, you fly in the cockpit of aircraft number ""C-GRYP"", a Boeing 727-2J4 of now-defunct Canadian carrier ""Royal Airlines"". This program, made in 1998, features three flights, with landings at Monterey (Mexico), Acapulco (Mexico), and Toronto (Canada).

The JPV camera places you right in the middle of the action on the flight deck of the Royal 727. See the pilots performing their pre-flight duties -- including the various checklists, engine start-up, communications with air-traffic control, taxi, takeoff, and landing.

After releasing 23 volumes in the ""Flight In The Cockpit"" series, ""Just Planes"" produced 63 more behind-the-scenes cockpit programs on VHS video under the newer ""World Air Routes"" label, beginning in October 1999. The video company has now switched entirely to the DVD format (dating from Summer 2001), releasing dozens of additional ""Air Routes"" titles, highlighting a vast array of the world's airlines (both big and small), on the better-quality Digital Disc format.

In addition, JPV Inc. has marketed more than 100 Airport titles on VHS and DVD. The many ""World Airport"" programs are ideal for ""plane-spotters"" who like to watch airplanes take-off and land all day long. JPV has focused its cameras on jetliners at just about every major international airport on the planet, with ""airside"" access (right next to the runways) being granted for the majority of this video footage, allowing the viewer to practically touch a taxiing Boeing 747 or a landing A340.
