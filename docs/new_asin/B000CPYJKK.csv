8100170,5,B000CPYJKK,"Gerbert is the cutest character of all the shows my toddler likes to watch. She's demonstrated to me that he's her favorite as we still conveniently watch VHS. We rarely have a chance to see this show on TBN's Smile of a Child Network as the line-up of programming is more extensive than it was in the past.

In my household, these are considered classics. Whenever my budget permits and as long as I see a need for these videos in children's church or with my youngest, I'd like to continue buying them. Perfect entertainment with Bible messages told in the cutest, but accurate way for children.",1369958400,,597,4.579439252336448
