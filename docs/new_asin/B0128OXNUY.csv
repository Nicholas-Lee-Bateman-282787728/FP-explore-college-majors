The directing seems like it was done by a first year film student that tries to be artsy and fails. Everything is a disjointed mess; very little rhyme or reason and worst of all, zero pay off for your troubles. The first story might be the best, about a young woman posting on Faithbook, a clear rip off of Facebook, only to find out the consequences for not gaining enough new friends is death. It's a SAW type puzzle that she must find her way out of but it's derivative at best.

The 2nd and 3rd stories aren't even worth mentioning besides the fact that they are terrible and very short. 15 minutes each doesn't allow much time to develop a story or characters you care about. And the endings are so cliche, so ham-handed, that they are laughable. There isn't anything scary about them and they seem to start or end in the middle of the story. Again, poor directing and really, really bad acting in Part III, Stalker, made me thankful they weren't more than 15 minutes apiece.

***SPOLIERS AHEAD-BUT REALLY, ARE YOU STILL GOING TO WATCH THIS??) The last piece Alone with Nanako, plays like some Hikikomori's wet dream, only the girl comes out of nowhere (again, the story seems like it starts in the middle) and throws herself at the loner, but then doesn't actually DO anything with the guy. She then takes him to a haunted house on the premise of making love, but she's a tease with an agenda. Thing is, the loner has one,too. And truth is, no one really cares; She's crazy, he's sick and then bam! It's over.

What a disappointing mess of a script, acting, writing,and directing. It just doesn't get much worse than this.",1509235200,,1717,4.461783439490445
