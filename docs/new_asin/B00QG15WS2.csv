8691168,1,B00QG15WS2,"I endorse the criticisms made by the other reviewers.  The cuts and changes have made this opera irritating to watch.  About the only positive I can mention about this production is Mojca Erdmann's singing, which is excellent (all the more remarkable from having to be delivered from frequently contorted positions).",1437004800,7,316,5.3
8691169,1,B00QG15WS2,"Do not, under any circumstances purchase this.  I gave it one star but it deserves a -5.  I am always fascinated by out of the ordinary interpretations of a work, and I for one liked the Loy production at ROH.  However, this is a total disfigurement of Berg's masterpiece.  The singing is quite good overall but there is no connection between what is happening in the opera and what you see on stage.  If you didn't know the piece at all, you would be totally lost.  The cutting of the opening is unforgiveable.  Luckily for me, I purchased this used and was able to return it.  You won't be so lucky if you purchase it.  Why this instead of some of the other terrific things that have been done at the Staatsoper is a mystery.",1436227200,5,727,4.325925925925926
8691170,1,B00QG15WS2,"[Note: I am able to write a review for the Berlin Lulu because I purchased it on amazon.it, where it was released on 16 February 2015.]

I thought that the Berg/Wedekind character of Lulu ends her life murdered in London by Jack the Ripper, but after watching this Berlin production Id rather say that she has been slaughtered by composer David Robert Coleman and director Andrea Breth, with the complicity or at least the abetment of Daniel Barenboim.

The front cover just read Alban Berg Lulu with the list of singers, conductor and so on. It is only on the back cover that you can read (in tiny characters) that Act III has been newly orchestrated by David Robert Coleman. Once purchased the DVD, once unwrapped, there it comes a much bigger surprise. On page 2 of a rather poor booklet you can read:

As a result of Berg's sudden death in 1935, his second and last opera remained a fragment and has now been completed by David Robert Coleman, who was commisioned by the Berlin State Opera Unter den Linden to elaborate the composer's sketches. The result is this new ""Berlin version"", premiered in 2012, which omits the prologue and the so called ""Paris scene"" at the beginning of Act III, in order to condense the plot and to underline the symmetrical structure intended by Berg.

So, only after buying it, you are finally warned that you have just purchased an abridged version of Lulu (shame on Deutsche Grammophone for not allowing customer to make informed choices).

For what concerns Berg's ""sketches"",we know that ""of the 1326 bars of Act III Berg had scored some 390"" [...] ""of the 1326 bars of Act III, only about 87 were not fully notated in Berg's short score and, with one exception, all these ""problematic"" passages could be completed in accordance with Berg's own intentions either by following the indications provided in the score or by doubling the instrumental parts."" (Douglas Jarman, Alban Berg. Lulu. Cambridge Opera Handbooks. pagg. 39-40).

For what concerns the plot, I am pretty sure that it has not been condensed but confused while the symmetrical structure intended by Berg has been in fact destroyed. For example, suppressing the Paris-scene (Act III, Scene I) meant suppressing, among others, the character of the Marquis, to whom Alwa makes a reference later (the fact that that reference has not been deleted by Mr. Coleman speaks volumes about the accuracy of his work-and that of the Dramaturg of the Berlin Staatsoper). What is worse, since Act III, according to the symmetrical structure intended by Berg, represents also a recapitulation of music from previous Acts, some music, like that related to the Prinz (Act I, Scene III) and then to the Marquis, remain without its recapitulation, while some other, like the so called Circus music of the Prologue that returns in the Paris-scene, suddenly (and, at this point, meaninglessly) pops out at the end of the opera.

Moreover, the rather important spoken dialogue in Act I, Scene II, between bars 414 and 415, has been totally cut (the singers just stay silent for several seconds), while at the very end of the opera, like P. Cherau did in his production at the Paris Opera, the director makes the Countess Geschwitz say (parlato): Verflucht! (Damned), like you read in the original text of Wedekind, but that Berg had had deleted.

I had the impression that the small orchestra on stage during Act I, Scene III has been replaced by a recording, but I am not sure, because the strange and cheap aural effect can also be due to some kind of amplification they have adopted.

The new orchestration of D. R. Coleman sounds little like what precedes it. Consider the barrel organ melody (originally a song by Wedekind) that opens Act III, Scene II: in Lulu-Suite it had its few initial bars orchestrated by Berg himself in a grotesquely manner that recalls the tragic effect of some Mahlers folk melodies; Mr. Coleman ignores Bergs original orchestration and proceeds in dressing the tune (and most of the following music) with what seems an ubiquitous accordion that makes you think of a stereotyped Parisian bistrot.

When it comes to the so called Regietheater, there are people like N. Lenhoff, S. Herheim, K. Holten, V. Nemirova who know how to deal with a musical text without renouncing to their original ideas and personality and who show at least some respect for their audiences; then there are people like Andrea Breth of this Berlin Lulu, the conformists of nonconformity, the academics of anti-academicism, people who cares just about their precious little ideas (too often at the expense of taxpayers).

The original Prologue (that Berg, please keep it in mind, left complete and revised) has been replaced by a spoken monologue taken from S. Kierkegaard. The opera is launched by the screaming chord that we will re-encounter at end, when Jack kills Lulu. Lights come up on a scrap yard (where the whole opera is set) and Act I follows like Berg composed it. Anyway, singers do not move, do not interact, they do not even exchange a glance, they just deliver their lines staring mostly towards the audience. Action and interaction is gradually introduced as the opera goes on, but it rarely fits exactly with what is going on in the music, as Berg has originally intended (you should read his score to fully understand the total fusion of action and music he tried to achieve).

M. Erdmann (Lulu) is spectacular for the ears as much for the eyes, anyway, given all the cuts, tampering and misconceptions of the production, I feel her many talents are simply wasted. Ditto for the other excellent members of the cast. Wasted are the labors of the excellent orchestra of the Staatskapelle Berlin conducted by Daniel Barenboim, wasted are the efforts of the team of technicians that provided great picture quality and sound.

During the tepid applause that greeted the first moments after the end, I had almost the vision of Berg himself vigorously clapping his hands-on the faces of those responsible for this production.

Id dare say this could be the worst production of Lulu ever, but I am not sure that Berlin version of Lulu can be still considered the Lulu of Berg/Wedekind. It is a hybrid, a strange medieval beast, a monster that never really existed and that, as such, should have been never put on DVD, but for bringing perpetual shame on people like Andrea Breth and David Robert Coleman and on people like Daniel Barenboim who did not raise a finger to prevent them from slaughtering Berg/Wedekinds Lulu.

PS. After writing this review, I read articles and discussions concerning the Berlin version of Lulu. It seems that it was Frau Breth who had the idea of cutting the Prologue ad Act III, 1  (according to a review written by Mark Berry, the opera was given with only one intermission). Then, since Universal Edition and F. Cerha refused to give permission to cut Act III, 1, Mr. Coleman was asked to prepare a new version of what was left of Act III. So, somewhat narcissistically, Frau Breth stuck with her original idea, showing she did it because she could despite everything. Nevertheless, I still blame Barenboim as the main culprit of this mess: when she came to him with her idea, he should have said: ""No, its bad, lets think about something else"" because I am sure that he knows that cutting Lulus score in that way would destroy the overall musical structure as planned by Berg. Moreover, after perusing the work of Mr. Coleman, Mr. Barenboim should have realized that it was not exactly a masterpiece. Why insisting? Is it a problem of too inflated egos? Do they wanted to be original, to do something different because they are bored to do the same operas again and again? Then do some Schreker or Zemlinsky or Korngold or Dukas or Marschner!

In the end, what I find truly irritating of this production (apart from the deceiving packaging devised by DG) is that conductor, singers and orchestra have done a great job, but they still owe us the real Lulu - they owe to us, not Berg who is dead or to Bergs score, but to us, the audience who loves Bergs music and pays for it.",1424908800,31,8108,4.784131522516083
8691171,1,B00QG15WS2,"This issue turns out to be rather frustrating, almost as dreadful as that of Loy's  for the Covent Garden. I have never understood  the reason why directors turn such a quick-paced, exuberant, delirant piece into a kind of Oratorio, where interpreters move  -so to speak- like puppets, slow-motion, with no real emotional connection among them. Lulu seems an icy girl, a rather frigid woman looking as lost as I felt while watching this rendering of the opera: sometimes you don't know who is who, what's really happening... One even wonders if this is Lul itself, since it has gone through very serious changes: the introduction by the clown has been substituted by a man lying on the floor reciting some Kierkegaard's words. The scene in Paris has been done away with. And  -SURPRISE, SURPRISE- Cerha's score is nowhere to be heard as the music has been changed for other composed by someone I have never heard of.
In a nutshell: a ridiculous, dreadful rendering of this masterpiece.",1424304000,21,985,4.880239520958084
