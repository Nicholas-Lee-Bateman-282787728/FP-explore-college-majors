5346255,5,B009L63QJ6,"OUTSTANDING!!! Once again Amazon Prime seems to amaze me. Another movie that had me actually watch and enjoy it. It was real and not a B movie and had me into it from beginning to end.

5346264,4,B009L63QJ6,"The horror genre is notorious for implausible story lines. But Cherry Tree Lane side-stepped that landmine by writing a tight script that beautifully illustrates how unprepared the real-life average family is for something like a home invasion.

Unlike many boring American movies that show families tooled up to the eyeballs when it comes to dealing with a threat, this urban couple responded in a typical fashion. The shock, as in, I can't believe this is really happening. The casual nature of the violence of these young men, again, a lot more typical than we'd like to think. The rape scene, all the more realistic because we don't see it, yet we hear the muffled screams.

When the gangs girlfriends show up, they take in the scenes of violence without raising an eyebrow because they've seen so much of it in their own homes. The script is much sharper than other critics realise and it's more credit-worthy because of how real it really is.

This film has not been panned because it was bad, but rather because it was too real, making those who watched it just a little uncomfortable. If the writer had stayed in the realm of fantasy and implausible plot lines, he might have got better reviews. The fact is, he got it right. His finger is on the pulse and if he holds true to his principles, he can use his art and talent to keep revealing the truth about life that gives the rest of us pause.",1379808000,,1402,4.577689243027889
5346265,1,B009L63QJ6,MY wife and I usually see a movie that when reading the back pulls us in and usually we are not disappointed and enjoy the movie. THE BACK OF THIS MOVIE IS MISLEADING TO ME  This one is horrible the acting is BAD and not to mention the characters have now chemistry together with one another.... this is not good horror or good suspense movie . THIS MOVIE is a total waste of your time  PASS THIS ONE UP,1373241600,,403,4.0886075949367084
5346266,1,B009L63QJ6,"Nothing good to say about this movie except that the low ratings it has are well deserved. The movie starts off with a flourishing couple drinking wine and eating dinner. Then their house is invaded by 2 black hoodlums and a white guy whose there just to be there. The movie has all the stereotypical elements that people fear black men doing to them. Breaking into their home,taking their money,raping their wife, hurting their kids, etc. etc. etc. I have yet to see a movie this insulting,ignorant,ridiculous,and down right disgusting in a long time. Then at the end the husband breaks free and all of a sudden the hoodlums start running away and he ends up catching one of the black guys (of course) and beating them to death (a fantasy). When early on in the movie it shows the same guy and his friends punching the guy in the face, knocking him to the ground and beating the stuffing out of him. It be strange to think that all of sudden now that this same guy is free this group of thugs would fear him and start running away. Wouldn't they just beat him up again for getting free? Any way I'm not sure who would enjoy this movie better yet I just question those who didn't catch how stereotypical this movie was.",1370217600,,1219,4.446428571428571
5346267,1,B009L63QJ6,"No real plot, horrible ending.  Left hanging at the end.  Did the boy live or die?  What did he do?",1369440000,,99,3.85
5346268,2,B009L63QJ6,"Michael (Tom Butcher) and Christine (Rachael Blake) have a strained relationship. He doesn't trust her after she confessed to an indiscretion. They also have an issue with their son Sebastien (Tom Kane) who have been hanging out with the wrong sort. Their conversation is low, so I needed to crank up the volume to hear what they were saying. What was with the still camera in the opening bedroom shot?

Soon some of Sebastien's mates break in looking for him in a bad sort of way. This becomes a home break-in film as our gang helps themselves to some cookies, DVDs, and the wife. Things get weird when the gang's girlfriends show up, one of which is dragging along her innocent pre-teen brother.

The break-in formula runs its course and rather quickly in this 77 minute film.

The acting was alright, the characters needed a little more developing. The home break-in terror was light compared to others in this genre. You might want to go watch ""Mother's Day"" or ""Last House on the Left"" again before seeing this one. Not really worth renting.

5346269,3,B009L63QJ6,"Despite its flaws, CHERRY TREE LANE emerges as a visceral and uncomfortable experience.  It's as senselessly cruel as A CLOCKWORK ORANGE but mercifully shorter.
Much of the dialogue is so thickly accented, portions are difficult to comprehend, especially early on.  What gives the film its impact is how angry it makes the viewer and how it makes us cheer when the tables are turned.  The movie's ""Will he or won't he"" final scene is chilling.  Overall, CHERRY TREE LANE is a disturbing home invasion film.",1362009600,,506,4.91764705882353
5346270,3,B009L63QJ6,"Filmmakers love to exploit people's worst fears. Think about all the films made over the years about plane disasters, natural disasters, zombie outbreaks, airborne pathogens, serial killers, and any and everything else released in theaters or on DVD weekly. For some reason, we're all drawn to seeing what might happen in any of these situations and experience them from the outside looking in. ""Cherry Tree Lane"" gives us a ""glass house"" view of what many people would consider one of the most frightening horrors they could experience: the home invasion.

An ordinary middle-class couple named Christine (Rachel Blake) and Mike (Tom Butcher) arrive at home and settle in for an evening together. Their son, Sebastian (Tom Kane), hasn't arrived yet. You can tell the two have issues between them through awkward talk at the dinner table.

The evening takes a turn for the worse when Christine answers a knock at the door and returns to the dining area held captive by a thug with a knife to her throat. The couple soon find themselves bound, gagged, and beaten as their captors await their son's arrival. It seems Sebastian is running with a rough crowd and turned in one of the young delinquent's brothers.

""Cherry Tree Lane"" is a slow-burning and tense movie that does its best to explore every aspect of a home invasion. However, instead of showing you everything, it leaves much to your imagination. It's not worse than seeing horrific actions onscreen, but creates a more stressful viewing experience.

Director / writer Paul Andrew Williams definitely knows how to pace a good suspense yarn. This has been referred to as a real-time thriller by some people. Let's just say a lot can happen in 77-minutes. ""Cherry Tree Lane"" shows audiences that it doesn't take too much time for lives to be destroyed and bad decisions to change the course of one's future forever.

Williams does a great job showing how messed up these thugs are throughout the film. One calls their parents and argues with them about a TV show they want recorded. Another one invites their girlfriend over to the scene of the crime to hang out. She brings her friend and a young boy with her. To them, this is just business as usual. It reminded me of how Alex and his droogs acted after a night of ultra-violence in ""A Clockwork Orange.""

Another way of looking at ""Cherry Tree Lane"" is as a cautionary tale. You never know how your actions are going to affect others. Sebastian's actions caused his parents to come to harm. He not only set himself up to be oppressed, but got others involved as well.

Although the movie is Unrated, it features violence, partial nudity, and a whole lot of bad language. This is definitely not for the squeamish. It's also not something you probably want your teenager or young children watching.

""Cherry Tree Lane"" only comes in a regular format DVD edition. There are no special features included in the packaging. It would've been nice to see a ""Making of"" featurette and get a little background on the project from director / writer Paul Andrew Williams.

At first, I felt ""Cherry Tree Lane"" was a bit slow-moving for my taste. After reflecting on it, I realized that it's actually a well-paced little film that explores an invasion of our privacy and humanity without being too exploitative. Don't get me wrong. It's disturbing and unnerving, but never steps over the line into ""torture-porn"" territory where a lot of movies like this tend to go.",1361318400,2,3463,4.816498316498317
5346271,1,B009L63QJ6,"Waste of money, waste of time, movie was horrible. I thought the story line was interesting, but the movie itself just really sucked.",1360454400,,133,4.826086956521739

5346273,1,B009L63QJ6,"This movie really sucked.  Watching paint dry would have been more fun.  In americia we love seeing violence, not trying to imagine it taking place.",1359676800,2,148,4.88
5346274,3,B009L63QJ6,"A simple night at home turns into a deadly game of survival for Christine and Michael when three of their son's low-life friends hold them hostage while waiting for him to return. Director Paul Andrew Williams of THE COTTAGE fame has digested the works of Wes Craven and Michael Haneke then placed an urban edge on them in the 2010 home invasion Horror story, CHERRY TREE LANE. A strict dichotomy is drawn between Britain's upper and lower classes, where Williams has the chance to explore the mutual exclusivity of each through the microcosm on screen. The same dark humor that we experienced in FUNNY GAMES creeps through these teens' bleak world view as well, proposing a life in which violence and crime have become accepted as a daily occurrence. Where CHERRY TREE LANE falters is in its inability to bring anything new to the table. We have seen this all before, it has simply been reprocessed to fit the current social climate that surrounds Britain's inner city youth. Williams does leave us with a brilliant closing shot, however, and one that intentionally provokes the viewer to choose between giving in to their insatiable blood lust and desire for revenge, or to maintain their last hold on civilization. CHERRY TREE LANE does show a marked improvement in style and form for the director.
