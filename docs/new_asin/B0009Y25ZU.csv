2337260,5,B0009Y25ZU,"Andrew Bujalski's quietly impressive ""Funny Ha Ha"" uses the uncertain future of a smart but shy, post-graduate Boston woman as the launching pad for a beautifully observant and wholly unpretentious film with roots more in Cassavetes than Sundance-style showbiz. Made under the sway of the DIY (Do It Yourself) art movement, pic is a deliberate throwback to a much earlier American indie period, when filmmakers shot on 16mm, recorded in mono and didn't bother with a production company moniker. Besides being a surefire fest item, the film could have a bracing effect on adventurous auds and young filmmakers alike given the right distrib handling.

""Funny Ha Ha"" serves as a memorable debut for first-time thesp Kate Dollenmayer, whose Marnie becomes unselfconsciously emblematic of an entire generation of over-educated, under-employed American youth.

Marnie is first seen drunk at a tattoo parlor, but she's hardly some ""bad girl""; rather, she seems to take each step through life gingerly, not quite sure where to walk next. Randomness seems to rule her existence: She runs into friends Dave and Rachel (Myles Paige, Jennifer L. Schaper) and tags along with them to dinner, where she admits to Rachel that she has a crush on Alex (Christian Rudder) but instinctively -- and, it eventually turns out, correctly -- senses that it will go nowhere.

Film introduces characters and situations, and then allows them to percolate naturally to the surface. At her new temp office job, Marnie is seated alongside nice but ultra-nebbishy Mitchell (Bujalski), whose awkward way of showing interest in her doesn't emerge until his desperation move on her during her last day on the job.

The subsequent dates between Marnie and Mitchell surely rank among the most painfully awkward and real encounters between the sexes in recent movies, culminating in the sort of thoughtless and spontaneous behavior that goes on all the time in real life, but almost never on screen.

Bujalski's improv approach is gracefully married with a style that is not overly-dramatic, and therefore seems just a hair short of pure documentary. Even unexpected encounters that other directors may have exploited for intense dramatic effect, such as a drunk Dave suddenly kissing Marnie in a car, play out and then fade away with the natural pulse of everyday life.

Just as underplayed are myriad character details, such as Marnie's evident interest in religion, that are gently observed but never underlined.

The non-pro cast appears inspired from the first frame, none more so than Dollenmayer, who invests Marnie with a genuine expression of innocence concealing a certain adult wisdom that keeps her out of serious trouble. Dollenmayer is uncommonly attuned to Marnie's moment-by-moment responses --and knack for confused and confusing conversations, the film's constant source of wit.

Tech package couldn't be less slick, and this becomes the movie's true badge of honor.",1122249600,7,2947,5.268656716417911
2337261,5,B0009Y25ZU,"The characters of 27-year-old writer-director Andrew Bujalski's debut feature, Funny Ha Ha - a gaggle of recently graduated Bostonian college students - express themselves in a generational vernacular that favors such willfully vague terms as ""really,"" ""stuff"" and ""like."" Their behavior is prone to sudden impulsive gestures, like dropping a bottle of beer from a second-floor balcony, kissing a girlfriend's best friend, or running off and eloping with a supposed ex. Anything to prevent the ions in the air from becoming too static, too serious - in a word, too grown-up. If that sounds like territory previously claimed by early-1990s Hollywood concoctions like Singles and Reality Bites, so be it. But there is, in any one scene of Bujalski's film, more lived-in truth than can be found in its precursors.

With a dollop more self-confidence, Marnie (the radiantly shy Kate Dollenmayer) could have most guys at hello. Instead, she's a girl friend to many and girlfriend to none - a lack of commitment that also applies to her career, where she drifts from dreary temp job to dreary temp job. Marnie does pine for lanky computer programmer Alex (Christian Rudder), to whom she once confessed her feelings in a moment of drunken honesty. Now Alex is on the rebound, but he's still not interested. Dave (Myles Paige) might be interested, though he shouldn't be, given that he's in a long-term relationship with Marnie's friend Rachel (Jennifer L. Schaper). Marnie's dorky fellow temp, Mitchell (Bujalski), is definitely interested, though Marnie less so in him. And though she may be no one's idea of a hero, the indecisive Marnie does throw herself heroically, time and again, into that mysterious void that is being young and smart and completely unsure of yourself.

Like two of his acknowledged influences, John Cassavetes and Mike Leigh (to which one might add the French director Jean Eustache, whose The Mother and the Whore I'd bet is a Bujalski favorite), Bujalski takes a sledgehammer to the carefully ordered surfaces and dramatic conventions of narrative cinema, favoring instead an unpredictability in which the crosscurrents of quotidian life collide on the screen in a series of brilliantly alive patterns. This isn't improvisation, but rather an adroitly achieved randomness - the perfect syntax for a generation-defining work about a generation marked by its very lack of definition.",1122249600,6,2402,5.22020725388601
2337262,5,B0009Y25ZU,"""Funny Ha Ha"" New York Times review, by A.O. Scott:

Marnie (Kate Dollenmayer) is 23, and she drifts through ""Funny Ha Ha,"" Andrew Bujalski's low-budget first feature, in search of love and employment - with pretty disappointing results. The young men she is drawn to don't reciprocate, and she can't quite bring herself to respond to the one guy who seems to be genuinely smitten with her. After temping for a while, she finds a job doing research for a professor, which seems reasonably tolerable.

What gives this film its quiet pathos is not so much the relative bleakness of Marnie's circumstances but the modesty of her expectations. At one point, she makes a to-do list, and its lack of ambition - ""spend more time outdoors,"" ""make friends with Jackie,"" ""learn to play chess"" - is both funny and sad.

Marnie would never admit to anything more acute than mild depression, and Mr. Bujalski captures the ache of her existence without pity or melodrama. She is lonely, but far from alone, because ""Funny Ha Ha,"" much as it is the story of a few difficult, uneventful months in her life, is also a deft group portrait of recent college graduates - her friends, co-workers and would-be lovers - groping their way across the flatlands of early adulthood.

Their conversational tics sound at once stylized and improvised, and the movie's narrative rhythms are loose and ambling. It feels as artless and scattered as Marnie and her cohort, who wear old T-shirts with holes in them and decorate their apartments with nondescript furniture, some of it probably hauled in from the sidewalk. But this scruffiness is a bit deceptive, as ""Funny Ha Ha"" has both a subtle, delicate shape and a point.

Like John Cassavetes, whose influence is apparent here, Mr. Bujalski is an acute and intelligent dramatist who uses the appearance of chaos as a means of emotional exploration. I would bet that the ragged, swerving scenes in his film are much more tightly scripted and carefully rehearsed than they sometimes seem, which was almost always the case with Cassavetes. The main difference is that while Cassavetes's characters are often at the mercy of their feelings and pushed to the point of eruption, Mr. Bujalski's are cut off from theirs, and able to communicate only by painful, semi-ironic indirection.

If it were not so resolutely modest, and so rigorously confined in its minute observations of individual behavior, you might almost call ""Funny Ha Ha,"" which was completed in 2002, a generational statement. But that would be false to both the film's aesthetic and to its insights. Mr. Bujalski's characters do not make statements; they barely make eye contact with one another, and they communicate in a hesitant, noncommittal idiom, prefacing every utterance with phrases like ""I don't know"" and ""I'm sorry."" They spend their days working in grungy offices and their evenings drinking beer and eating hummus at impromptu parties.

The anomie of middle-class 20-somethings is hardly an unexplored subject in American movies, and ""Funny Ha Ha"" might at first glance be taken as yet another example of post-""Slacker"" indie solipsism. But Mr. Bujalski's artistic self-confidence and the low-key idiosyncrasy of his cast resist such easy labeling.

This movie feels less like a careerist calling card than like a genuine effort to use film - and it is film, rather than the more modish digital video - to probe and reveal the curious facts and stubborn puzzles of contemporary life. It is a small, plain movie, shot in 16 millimeter in dull locations around Boston; but also, like its passive, quizzical heroine, it is unexpectedly seductive, and even, in its own stubborn, hesitant way, beautiful.

2337263,5,B0009Y25ZU,"As any Publishers Clearing House winner can attest: Dreams do come true! I've been hoping for two years that people who don't write about movies or stalk them at film festivals would get to experience the wonderful vagaries of Andrew Bujalski's ''Funny Ha Ha,"" which, after languishing who knows where, finally opens today at the Coolidge, while his second film just played at last week's Independent Film Festival of Boston.

It's both obvious and inexplicable why the release of ''Funny Ha Ha"" went nowhere for so long. Obvious: The film lacks polish. Inexplicable: That's part of its charm. (Bujalski has a bracingly unadorned style, and Matthias Grunsky's handheld photography is actually quite lovely.) Obvious: The cast is full of amateurs, especially Kate Dollenmayer, the woman playing Marnie, the film's heroine. Inexplicable: She is also one of the most simply complicated movie characters I've ever seen.

Marnie is 23, lives in the post-college, crypto-slacker ghettos of Allston, and is unmoored, unambitious, and freshly fired from a mediocre office job. She prefers to wear T-shirts and is a sweetly impulsive drunk. Her to-do list consists of such goals as ''become a better cook,"" ''go to museums,"" and, my favorite, ''spend more time outside."" And the Scarlett Johansson of ''Lost in Translation"" and Anna Karina in the Jean-Luc Godard movie of your choice are her kindred spirits.

But, honestly, Marnie isn't that fancy. Dollenmayer acts with refreshing understatement, and there's eloquence in her gracelessness. You've borrowed this girl's literature notes back in college, you've tried to pick her up once at a party, you've seen her staring into space alone on her front stoop. She's like a lot of upbeat people with no immediate plans for the future and nothing glamorous in mind, and nearly everything about her life is a misalliance, particularly where romance is concerned.

One of the beauties of Bujalski's writing and directing is the way little slights resonate with Marnie. She has to hear from Rachel and Dave (Jennifer L. Schaper and Myles Paige) that Alex (Christian Rudder), her longstanding crush, has just broken up with his girlfriend. That's ridiculous: She just ran into him, and he didn't mention that at all. But, as ''Funny Ha Ha"" illustrates with great accuracy, that's life.

Alex's sister, Susan (Lissa Patton Rudder), tells Marnie she should pursue Alex, who, in a humiliating and awkward moment, calls Marnie to say, politely, back off. But Alex is a burgeoning master of the mixed signal, saying they should talk some more about this, and also telling her about a job doing research for his uncle. Meanwhile, Marnie lets Mitchell (Bujalski), a painfully meek yet surprisingly direct co-worker at a temp gig she takes, think she has a boyfriend. She has no real interest in Mitchell but out of guilt -- or boredom -- keeps him around, anyway.

Bujalski's circle of characters and the social and romantic entanglements among them start to resemble the webs in Jane Austen and Edith Wharton, if either woman wrote for the post-collegiate Trader Joe's set. Marnie's life is less resolved than in Austen and far less tragic than in Wharton. (Whit Stillman's more poised and more self-conscious ''Metropolitan"" comes to mind, too.)

Where class determined attraction in those books, good timing and personal taste dictate the pairings in ''Funny Ha Ha."" So Alex's vagueness and passive-aggressive tactics make him a thoroughly modern love interest. And all the hypo-masculine, almost fey affect of this movie's males locates them on a small planet of halting and insecure man-boy stars such as Tobey Maguire and Jake Gyllenhaal. Half the appeal of pursuing such a man lies in waiting to see whether he'll ever declare himself.

''Funny Ha Ha"" is a smartly observed, unpretentious, and unconventional comedy of manners -- or more properly, it's a comedy of mannerisms, for none of its addled characters seems capable of composing a thought without stopping along the way to consider it. During that phone call to Marnie, Alex says: ''I don't know. It's just. I mean. You know what I'm saying? It's just . . . a bad time for me.""

I imagined my mother listening to all the inserted ''likes"" and ''you knows"" used here and asking with exasperation, ''Will they ever finish a thought?"" But these characters' inarticulateness is perfect for their inchoate feelings. Bujalski's is one of the first movies to put such sensitive and true characters on screen in all their imperfections. He deserves a good, long career, something that returns us to what took so long for it to get started -- the craven distributors and exhibitors of the world. To them, there's this to say: To ignore him is to ignore the stammering voice of a generation.

2337265,2,B0009Y25ZU,"""Funny Ha Ha"" was not a film which made me laugh.  It made me nervous.  The characters seemed uncomfortable with themselves.  They twitched and reached out toward their desires and then as quickly pulled their hands away.  My favorite character was Jennifer L. Schaper's Rachel who seemed to be a hippie, comfortable with herself and her relationship with Dave.  While she wasn't movie-star gorgeous by any means, she seemed to be the girl next door that you hoped would live nearby.  The low production values of the film make you want to root for it.  But a funny -- not funny as in humorous, but more funny like peculiar -- thing happens about halfway through the movie.  You wonder if anything is ever going to actually happen.  We see Kate Dollenmayer's Marnie plodding through various employment situations and trying on relationships like gloves that don't fit too well.  I was tired; so I fast-forwarded through the rest of the film to see if something happened.  It didn't seem like it, but I decided to return the next day and actually finish watching the movie, just so I could say I'd done it.  I did it.  Why, I don't know.  Filmmaker Andrew Bujalski has a nervous Woody Allen-like style that would be more appealing if he also had a sense of humor.  Christian Rudder as Alex looked like he could be a romantic interest, but then he maybe got married to a girl without having a ceremony.  Myles Paige's Dave drunkenly puts the moves on Marnie in an automobile and then leaves without cashing in.  Kate Dollenmayer won the Best Actress Runner Up Award of the National Society of Film Critics for this in 2005.  I'm not sure what she ran up to, or why they wanted to recognize this.  I didn't find a great artistic statement in this movie.  If you're looking to cheer about this, it's boy gets 16 mm camera, boy shoots movie, boy gets it on DVD and makes a second film.  Nothing in the movie itself grabbed me.  In the end, I wished I rented a different movie.  ""Boring Snore Snore"" would have been a better title.  Taxi.",1172707200,7,2032,4.5497237569060776
2337266,4,B0009Y25ZU,"First time filmmaker Andrew Bujalski's extremely low-budget feature ""Funny Ha Ha"" has many of the hallmarks of an early John Cassavetes film:  grainy camerawork, minimalist storytelling, and naturalistic, ad lib performances.

Bujalski's cast of characters is made up entirely of white urban youth in their early to mid 20's - that awkward period in life after an individual has finished college yet before he has moved on to building his own career and family.  Given what appears to be their first real taste of freedom and independence, the characters do little but sit around, get drunk, and talk about their romantic relationships, but Bujalski observes all this without hysteria and judgment, thereby lending the film the aura of real life being caught on film.

The focal point is an attractive young woman named Marnie (Kate Dollenmayer) who drinks a bit too much, seems vaguely directionless and lacking in energy, and is somewhat inexperienced in the ways of love, but who, nevertheless, seems reasonably well grounded and knows her own limits as a person.

""Funny Ha Ha,"" despite its occasional raggedness and self-indulgence, is blessedly free of contrivance and melodramatics.  These may not be the most goal-oriented or socially-conscious youth we've ever encountered in the movies, but neither are they the most troubled or self-destructive.  They seem like pretty ordinary kids living in the moment and only vaguely aware that there's a world outside of themselves that they are destined to become a part of in the very near future.

The beauty of the dialogue rests in its ability to capture with uncanny accuracy the way people in the real world actually speak.  The characters interact in ways that are genuine and believable, and life just seems to be unfolding as we watch it on screen.  This is due in small measure to the fine performances from a cast of virtual unknowns who know how to appear relaxed, honest and natural in front of the camera.

With its improvisational and off-the-cuff filmmaking style and its abrupt, the-camera-just-ran-out-of-film ending, ""Funny Ha Ha"" makes us feel as if we are eavesdropping on the daily lives of a handful of relative strangers.  Lucky for us, they turn out to be people in whom we can see something of ourselves reflected, and with whom we enjoy spending our time.",1166227200,3,2332,5.044270833333333

In the other direction, I'm going on record with calling this one of the Best movies, ever. The writing, acting, filming, everything is perfect. The greatness of this film blows me away. I could watch this over and over for the rest of my life and be perfectly happy.

Just go see it. Rent it off Netflix, anything. Bujalski is one of the greats, and in ten years he will be known as one of the finest American filmmakers.",1163894400,3,507,4.28125
2337268,4,B0009Y25ZU,"At the outset it's pretty crummy, but by the end of the film we were rooting for Marnie (Kate Dollenmeyer) to succeed with her program of bettering herself.  She's not a great actress, and sometimes she looks better than others, but you do keep watching.  At first, when she stumbles drunk into the tattoo parlor and asks for a Celtic cross, you're like ""Oh no,"" but little by little first time director Andrew Bujalski allows us a deeper access into her heart.  I liked the scene where she and Alex spot a girlfriend passed out at the steering wheel of her car, parked in front of Marnie's apartment, and Marnie drops everything, even the chance to lure Alex into her bed, just to help the poor drunk girl.  Thus charity trumps lust for once, and makes the rest of the picture easier to take, for we realize there's more to Marnie than just being the kind of girl every guy wants to kiss, but not to go out on a whole date with.

Alex, the irresponsible boy, is well played by Christian Rudder.  Alex' longtime relationship with the va-va-voom Nina has reached a temporary excursus point when FUNNY HA HA begins, and he seems to be single, and when Matnie hears about this news indirectly from her pals Rachel and Dave, she can't help but linger a little too long at Alex's flame.  She knows he's wrong for her, but he's got her number in some white boy way, and she can't help herself.  The attentions of Mitchell, the gawky geek who temps with her the ""Intellitech,"" deflect her not a whit.

The film slightly overdoes how Marnie is supposed to be a beauty, and Mitchell a nerd.  I just didn't believe this angle of the story, and it's easy to see that writer/director/editor Andrew Bujalski isn't very much into it, for he rewards himself with healthy close-ups that show, after all, he's a hot guy despite himself.  The actors can't really act, but all in all, FUNNY HA HA is considerably superior to SHADOWS, the Cassavetes film to which it has been frequently compared.

For those of us writing our own stuff and lining up our amateur actors, Funny Ha Ha is a wild success.

A nerds dream, Kate Dollenmayer, not so pretty that the good lookin' guys whisk her away, but quirky, and cute enough for the nerds to go bananas.  As a twenty-three year-old ex-college student, she is bored out of her mind by paper shuffling jobs and a social whirl that is not unlike dorm life, but more urban trendy in a run down apartment way.  Ah, how we remember all those crash pads of yore.  Nothing has changed since the sixties.  Kate drinks too much, wanders around in a daze too much, and is in love with a guy as dazed and unsure as she.  She could have sex anytime with anyone to relieve tension, but has sex not at all.  A couple of kisses with a boy here and there are as much as our slackers will chance.  I got a kick out of the Russian Scholar Woman's interpretation of Marnie's lifestyle in the commentary feature.  She claims that two-hundred years ago falling in love was dangerous.  Either you got married, had a family, or you killed yourself.  Today, these slackers of the last half century take no risk in love.  They merely move in circular social sets defined by their lack of articulation.  No one ever says I love you aloud seriously.

This Boston ultra-indie-which Bujalski wrote, directed, edited, and co-starred in-slouches through the blurry limbo of post-collegiate existence, a period at once ephemeral and cruelly decisive. It opens with 23-year-old heroine Marnie (Kate Dollenmayer) stumbling into a tattoo parlor, where the proprietor refuses to ink her because she's plastered. This movie is about the fear of the permanent-and the barely conscious, unwittingly reckless processes behind life-altering decisions-might be subtitled The Possibly Indelible Adventures of a Desultory Twentysomething.

Structured around nonevent and inaction, Funny Ha Ha recalls Jamie Thraves's 2000 British indie The Low Down, a neglected mini-masterpiece of quarter-life malaise. Bujalski's film likewise thrums with ambivalent dread-underlying the characters' inert indecision is a reluctance to let the rest of their lives begin, not least for fear that it might prove an undifferentiated haze. The final scene is as close to perfection as any Amerindie has come in recent memory-in a single reaction of Marnie's, we see a small but definite shift in perspective; abruptly, Bujalski stops the film, as if there's nothing more to say. It's a wonderful parting shot for a movie that locates the momentous in the mundane.",1122249600,13,1413,5.665094339622642
2337289,5,B0009Y25ZU,"It's both obvious and inexplicable why the release of ''Funny Ha Ha"" went nowhere for so long. Obvious: The film lacks polish. Inexplicable: That's part of its charm. (Bujalski has a bracingly unadorned style, and Matthias Grunsky's handheld photography is actually quite lovely.) Obvious: The cast is full of amateurs, especially Kate Dollenmayer, the woman playing Marnie, the film's heroine. Inexplicable: She is also one of the most simply complicated movie characters I've ever seen.

One of the beauties of Bujalski's writing and directing is the way little slights resonate with Marnie. She has to hear from Rachel and Dave (Jennifer L. Schaper and Myles Paige) that Alex (Christian Rudder), her longstanding crush, has just broken up with his girlfriend. That's ridiculous: She just ran into him, and he didn't mention that at all. But, as ''Funny Ha Ha"" illustrates with great accuracy, that's life.",1122249600,11,908,5.2620689655172415
2337290,5,B0009Y25ZU,"Not the laugh riot its title suggests, this gently humorous indie stars Kate Dollenmayer as a recent college grad who's drifting and stumbling into adulthood. Maybe it's all her partying with alumni buds. Or the fact that she's still crushing on friend Christian Rudder, who's just not that into her. Or because she was recently fired while asking for a raise. Bummer. What's a mopey, aimless chick to do? Dollenmayer dives into the temp pool and catches the eye of nervous doofus Andrew Bujalski (who wrote and directed this). The painfully earnest guy tries his clumsy best, but the spurned nerd can't win more than her friendship. Despite its student-film look and hesitant start, this low-budget flick definitely grows on you, as do its awkward characters and their, like, we don't know, stuttered but kinda endearing, um, slacker-speak. Ha Ha is an honest portrait of twentysomething dating--and one with lots of heart.",1122249600,8,924,5.0855263157894735
2337291,5,B0009Y25ZU,"Marnie is such a complex character. she can't be reduced to any simple adjectives, and I read something somewhere about how this director wants his characters' lives to ""go around corners"" (like Mike Leigh used to say).  anyway, he explained that he wants the audience to imagine that the characters have lives even when you don't see them.  i look at it like hes making a film where he doesnt have to hold our hands and lets us appraoch it like grown-ups. kind of appropriate for a film that is sort of about that approach to life.",1122249600,7,532,4.474226804123711
2337292,5,B0009Y25ZU,"This low-budget indie film by twenty-six-year-old Harvard grad director/writer/editor Andrew Bujalski is a scream. It's a pitch-perfect romantic comedy slice of life film that gets inside the heads of its slacker twentysomething subjects and keeps things moving in a natural way that adds to the charm of the genuine landscape created. Bujalski makes his debut feature a gem, using in a low-key way a wonderful nonprofessional cast. He shot it on-location in Boston on 16 mm film. It covers the haphazard doings of the aimless 24-year-old slacker Marnie.

The inarticulate and unassuming heroine can't make contact with others despite all her efforts to converse with friends, go out to dinner with them and attend parties. Marnie goes through a series of drunken conversations, flirtateous encounters, and personal misapprehensions, and comes out of it in the same foggy way she first began--still unable to make the transition from college life to being an adult.",1122249600,5,965,5.30718954248366

This movie is an ode to all those unguided, self-conscious, undecided, sheltered, boring, socially-awkward, middle-class, college-educated, underemployed, conceited, and mundane white people you may, or hopefully do not, know.  This is possibly the whitest movie I've ever seen, and most definitely the most pathetic.

The good reviews from this movie are definitely from people who value art/film school as the best life-choice, like all things vintage, worship the Starbucks goddess(or hate its corporate status, except for that one time you had to work there to make ends meet), think all cultures should be accepted but unabashedly loathe and fear all things different, think mutton chops are cool, wear fedoras, and, in sum, are just those well-to-do hipster white people you love to make fun of, and hate.

Hate and make fun of, mind you, not watch an hour and change in their boring pathetic lives. The dialogue is painful, the characters are pubescent, at best, and everything is just so... bleh.  I watched about half an hour of this movie hoping a black person would come in, slap the s*** out of these pathetic people and mug them.  It would definitely add one real interesting person into the story I could care about and connect with on an emotional level, not to mention some color. (Did I mention hypocritical, middle-class, pathetic, conceited, white people?)

Let me say it again, this movie is all about pathetic 20 something middle-class white people who have nothing to do with their lives except film it, and even with the power of editing it sucks... this is not a movie you want to see.

I expect to be ""no to helpfulness"" by a group of fanboys and fangirls who check their reddits all day, tweet, instagram, and follow pitchfork.com on their iPhone 5s. (but isn't it so terrible how those Chinese factory workers are treated)

For those who actually like this movie here's a tip: get a life you pitiful tool, your 30s will be gone before you know it and you best start saving up for that mid-life crisis when you realize how little you have accomplished, but maybe you can't even do that with that crushing student and/or credit card debt still haunting you... Funny ha ha.",1359849600,3,2296,4.836734693877551
8070126,5,B0009Y25ZU,"If you like movies that make you want to stab its actors in the eardrums so they'll be forced to communicate solely through Facebook chat, because it's all they're fit to do, you might enjoy this movie like I did.

Marnie's an interesting character. Her ubernerd friend Mitchell says ""she's an amazing person,"" and it's true. She's nice, funny, unassuming, and fun. So why does she have trouble finding a guy? I've narrowed it down to two reasons: 1. Every guy in her social circle is either a fooshbag or a social fooshtard, and most are both. 2. She is a social fooshtard. When she talks to crush Alex about their relationship, she closes off like a scared valve, and is unable to emit a single mote of feeling.

Speaking of - Alex is an interesting character. He's also a fooshbag. Marnie likes Alex because he's one of the few humans she knows who can hold up his end of a conversation. Despite this, Alex can be dismissive, marginally mean, and generally handles his relationship with Marnie like a poophead.

This movie is about really awkward people who suck at getting what they want and expressing themselves. I don't buy the idea that these people are everymen; though we've all had awkward moments, I couldn't relate to the level of awkwardness here at all. In fact, if I had to live through the level of awkwardness and anxiety present in this movie, I would definitely shoot myself in the eardrum. But here's a whole community of these people. How do they do it??

This could have easily been too grating to watch, but Bujalewski did a really good job of 'making it real', and communicating the desperate importance of its unfolding events for its characters. As Marnie found out about her crush's breakup, got a new job, drank at parties and interacted with people, I was completely absorbed in all of it.

I think I rate movies by their power of engagement. As I get old I find it harder to be engaged in movies. This movie was very engaging.",1344470400,,1957,4.58

The 24-year-old star wanders through her college town life, in meaningless jobs, in pursuit of a boyfriend she can't have, while a nerd (the director/writer) pursues her but keeps sabotaging himself. In fairness, I was able to watch this to completion, which is rare for me. The cover contains some rave reviews, so someone liked it. I did notice the use of a pay phone here while some characters appear to have late 90s cellphones. Was the pay phone a deliberate anachronism? No laughs here, no sex and no tears either.

This is indeed a film that draws its audience in mysteriously in spite of the fact that little happens and that the characters (one really thinks of them more as people) rarely are able to express a complete thought in a complete sentence.

The pleasure is voyeuristic. The viewer feels as if she is watching real life over the shoulder of the camera. The low budget ""tech package"" (as one reviewer called it) adds to the effect, as do even Marnie's sad shapeless t-shirts. The mother in me wanted to order her up some new clothes. If only she'd spend a little time at the make-up counter at NM, she could clearly snare Alex (not that he's worth the trouble, esp. now that he's married to Liz!). I think she should cultivate that friendship with Jackie the chic librarian, who knows how to put an outfit together and will be able to set her up with the cute barristo.

Well, you get the point: a seductive movie that keeps it real.",1190505600,,1006,4.461956521739131
8070132,2,B0009Y25ZU,"A lot of trendy critics are praising this film like it's the future of cinema (the press have dubbed films like this ""the mumblecore movement"").  While this film is not a complete disaster, it is not earth shattering.  In critics' cirlces, there has been comparisons to Cassavettes, Truffault, and the French New Wave!  These are incredibly misplaced and utterly ridiculous.  Ironically, having read a couple of interviews with the director of this film, he might agree that the press are overdoing it.  This is just a film about 20 somethings sitting around, talking, working, sleeping, eating, etc., etc..  The film is at best OK.  It starts out decently, has a nice cinema verite feel to it, but as it progresses, it becomes tedious and tired, as nothing really interesting or artistic ever happens.  Many have done the cinema verite route before (Fassbinder's Why Does Herr R. Run Amok? is a good example, along with some of Cassavettes's work), but just because the film is done in a realistic manner doesn't make the film a work of genius.  I think critics are so desperate at times to find a new ""movement"" that they elevate mediocre films like this to gold status.  Some might say that the point of the film was to show these people as they really are, but I was really bored by this.  Some will say ""you just didn't get it"".  Well, yes, I did, and it's not a good film at all.  Kate Dollenmayer is a pretty engaging actress, and some of the supporting players are good.  Technically, the film is average for an indie film, but the sound is horrible in some places.  When Kevin Smith shot Clerks (a much better film than this one), the sound was rough at times but it was consistent.  Sometimes the sound here is blaring, other times you can't understand one word. Aside from the technical problems, the film isn't particularly good, and it is not a masterpiece.",1190419200,2,1870,4.655487804878049
