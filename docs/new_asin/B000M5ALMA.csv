8166415,1,B000M5ALMA,"as a civil war buff i was excited to see a documentary on brandy station.unfortunately,it is primarily a bunch of overweight re-enactors milling about on horses or trotting slowly while the narration drones on with maps which have no directional keys.it does describe the battle decently but the maps and details are sorely lacking.the video itself is not of great quality and some of the audio skips about.if you have to have it,buy it but you will not be satisfied with this product.",1209254400,4,485,4.855421686746988
