2614082,5,B000GIWHEI,"When I saw this DVD at my local Cracker Barrel, I hesitated to purchase it - but only briefly.  I can still remember laughing until I cried when I watched this show as a child and I'm happy to say that decades later, I laugh just as I hard when I pop this baby into my DVD player.  In fact, I've watched it a couple of times and I'm STILL laughing!

Only Alan Funt perfected the art of granting us the opportunity to ""watch people being themselves"".  He did this by placing people in various, unexpected situations that were either comical, crazy, or even at times ""Twilight Zone-ish"".  The comedy results as we watch the unsuspecting performers as they react to their respective situations.  Some of my personal favorites:  the talking horse; the motorless vehicle; the stenographer; the talking mailbox; the sideways elevator; and a host of other snippets that had me laughing so hard my sides ached.

For those of you who may not be familiar with Candid Camera, this isn't just another one of ""America's Funniest Home Videos"".  There are no scenes of motorcycle or three-wheeler wipe-outs, no one falls 8 or 10 feet off a stage or anything else, and you won't see anyone puking on screen, either.  Candid Camera is fresh, innovative, funny, and wonderfully lacking in anything that could be deemed offensive or disgusting.

Another unique addition to this DVD is several interviews with young children.  ""Out of the Mouths of Babes"" is never without its charm - and with Alan Funt as the interviewer, it's even more endearing.  I'm sure that this DVD will keep me laughing for years to come.",1213747200,26,1594,4.7111913357400725
2614083,1,B000GIWHEI,"It contains mostly washed-out old B&W episodes. I own the VHS version, which I wanted to replace. But in the new DVD version they took out most of the newer and funnier episodes. I presume they are expecting to hit me again with another DVD set for those missing episodes. NOT A CHANCE.",1208476800,4,286,4.415094339622642
2614084,2,B000GIWHEI,This was not what I exspected....There were very few funny scenes. The only ones any good were the old Candid Shows.....I didn't like the newer Candid Camera shows....I watched this dvd and got bored....,1195776000,6,203,5.0
2614085,2,B000GIWHEI,Unfortunately this does not make me laugh. My young children didn't laugh either. Maybe I'm not old enough and the generation gap is too big for this footage to work for me (I'm 41 years old). The footage is very old- most jokes filmed from the black and white tv era. Maybe my father (who's 72) will laugh. I'll have to stick with utube hidden camera clips.,1192233600,,358,4.358208955223881
2614086,5,B000GIWHEI,"This was a gift for my Dad.  It got there relatively promptly (was a little late).  He loves it, watched it in the airport and said he cried the whole way from laughing so hard.",1169078400,6,177,4.0285714285714285
2614087,5,B000GIWHEI,This is a great DVD that will have you roaring out loud with laughter!  My husband and I watched this dvd on our portable dvd player while flying home from Hawaii on a night flight.  I had to do all I could do to contain myself from not laughing too loudly so I wouldn't disturb some of the passengers who were trying to sleep.  You will not be disappointed in this DVD.,1157673600,24,370,4.111111111111111
2614088,5,B000GIWHEI,"I have been waiting for what's turned out to be a year for Rhino to release this DVD because I didn't want to buy the huge (and expensive) box set. Allen Funt was one of my heroes growing up and it sounds like this DVD has his prime material, at a bargain price. This show still beats the hell out of any of today's reality shows, none of which have a genius at the level of Mr. Funt at the helm.",1152921600,11,396,3.9012345679012346
2614099,5,B000GIWHEI,Brings back great memories and I wish life would be that simple and people were still innocent and would laugh at the little things in life again.,1356652800,4,146,4.444444444444445
2614100,1,B000GIWHEI,"Really don't pay for this, It is not worth the money. It had a few funny moments but most of it was interviews and not the best candid camera's situations.
I am sorry I bought this, I really expected better. Not the greatest Moments!!!!!!",1329436800,,238,4.431818181818182
2614101,5,B000GIWHEI,"Just finished 2 hours of the funniest video ever seen and the the kids can watch it too! I wish they would have included the country road invisible railroad crossing with flashing lights,bells, and lowering gates and a raidroad conductor swinging a lantern. there was even a loudspeaker hidden with sounds of an approaching train. Now please put the adult version on DVD.",1321833600,4,371,4.904761904761905
2614102,3,B000GIWHEI,"Can anyone tell me if there's a scene on this video of a man getting a haircut, but the barber isn't actually cutting anything off?  My father was in an episode back in the day, so I thought I'd try to track it down as a gift. Thanks!",1318377600,,234,3.875
2614103,5,B000GIWHEI,"I am deciding whether to get this primarily for one clip.  It's the episode where a guy leaves a little boy at a desk with a phone and tells him him he'll be right back but he's expecting a call, take a message.  I just remembering laughing till I cried on that one, but I'm afraid it might not really be included here. Can anyone confirm that it is?",1302048000,,350,4.057971014492754
2614104,4,B000GIWHEI,"A few of the episodes had me cracking up. However, I was surprised by the choice of some other episodes because they were not even remotely funny and even boring. I thought with over 30 years of footage, this DVD would be all the best of the best but it wasn't the case. It's still a good value for the money overall.",1299888000,,317,4.129032258064516
2614105,5,B000GIWHEI,"I still laugh today when I remember some of the stits they used to do on Candid Camera.  Got this for mother for Christmas to
keep her laughing!",1287360000,3,144,4.142857142857143
2614106,1,B000GIWHEI,"This box set is a waste of time and money.  It's no secret Allen Funt liked the sound of his own voice and loved seeing himself on TV -- and that's mostly what you get with this stingy Candid Camera box set: Funt's endless explanations of what you are about to see, why it's funny and how influential the show was. His son Peter is easier to take but if you've got good footage, why do you need a host at all? Why do you need expensive sets and wardrobes if all you're doing is introducing clips?  You'll find yourself fast-forwarding past all the boring chatter (Pam Dawber expounding on why she likes Candid Camera, for instance) for just a handful of clips, and very few of the really classic ones. I recommend the newer generation Candid Camera called Just For Laughs (no hosts, no long set-ups, more gags per minute). Peter Funt HAS great film in the Candid Camera archives, but with this tiresome format don't expect to see much of it.",1267660800,19,941,4.433526011560693
2614107,3,B000GIWHEI,"I ordered Candid Camera: ""What Do You Say To A Naked Lady"",and got ""Candid Camera: Greatest Moments"" instead.  I still enjoy Candid Camera, but the seller should have honored my order with the one that I requested and paid for.  M. Hess",1267142400,,236,4.595238095238095
2614108,4,B000GIWHEI,"We absolutely love Candid Camera. This particular DVD is absolutely hilarious and we found ourselves laughing often at the antics. However, the Lord's name in vain is used several times throughout the DVD, which is sad. Had it been edited out (as a couple of the swear words were) then I would have easily rated this with five stars.",1259539200,6,333,4.661016949152542
8132844,5,B000GIWHEI,the gags are so funny you laugh so hard you sides hurt you! wish this show was still on the air!,1508112000,,96,3.619047619047619
8132845,5,B000GIWHEI,"I have never seen anything funnier. If it's possible to be both sweet and malicious, these little episodes succeed in doing that.",1465344000,,129,4.909090909090909
8132846,1,B000GIWHEI,You has advertised 23 hrs of candid camera there is no more than 3 hrs max - I love candid camera but was very disappointed with the false advertising,1447286400,,150,4.206896551724138
8132847,5,B000GIWHEI,"Great,,,,really enjoyable...",1443830400,,28,13.5
8132848,5,B000GIWHEI,This brings back great memories when I used to watch this show.  It's still funny as it was back in the day. It's  unfortunate that they don't make shows like this anymore.  They really need to bring shows like this back.,1426982400,3,221,4.341463414634147
8132849,5,B000GIWHEI,"This DVD doesn't have all of my favorites...it doesn't have a ton of content in general, but it does have some old, some new, and some very fun moments. I don't have money to buy the complete package for a couple hundred dollars so I am glad that this more manageable collection is available and covers the ground it does. In particular, I love the splitting cars so if you remember that from the old days, yes, it's on this film.",1424736000,3,430,4.320987654320987
8132850,5,B000GIWHEI,Very happy with purchase,1404604800,,24,5.25
8132851,3,B000GIWHEI,"I needed a collection to bring laughter to myself so I got a few of these.
It was enjoyable to watch visually so I don't get too serious in life. ;)",1400284800,3,148,3.806451612903226
8132852,5,B000GIWHEI,"This DVD brought a lot of laughs!  The whole family enjoyed watching it.  If you need a dose of laughter, just play this DVD.",1393804800,,125,4.166666666666667
8132853,5,B000GIWHEI,"Finding this DVD was so awesome. I remember as a child sitting on the floor watching this show with my Dad laying on the couch watching it with me. He would laugh so hard he would roll off of the couch! I was able to revive that memory for my entire family on Christmas Eve when I gave this to him as a present. This was extra special to me and my younger brother, bringing back memories that had been lost for 30 plus years!",1358899200,4,425,4.011764705882353
