I never thought something called ""Bounce into Shape"" would give me a good workout, but wow it does!  It's a great video to do at home because you don't need too much space to do it.  It's a good workout for lower body, but if you do the aerobic workout while carrying the ball it really works arms too.",1286323200,2,392,4.131578947368421
8615691,1,B000WTZ68K,I was keen to get this DVD as i have other Lucy Knight DVD's which are very good.  Unfortunately the quality of the filming on this DVD is so poor that just even watching it makes you feel sick.  the filming does not flow and is very jumpy.,1229731200,,240,3.9791666666666665
