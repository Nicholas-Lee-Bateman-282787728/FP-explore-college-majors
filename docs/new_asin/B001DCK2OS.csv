8292723,5,B001DCK2OS,"I've read Grace Rules, Grace Walk and Grace land. I'm watching the videos now. The first video was amazing. There's so much revealed truth that I had to watch it again. I am going to use much of what is in it for a mini sermon this week. If you attend church and have been for a long time these videos will change you!
