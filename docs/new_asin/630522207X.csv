989618,3,630522207X,"""How Stella Got Her Groove Back"" is a 1998 adaptation of Terry McMillan's novel of the same name. Workaholic stockbroker Stella Payne (Angela Bassett) is roped into a Jamaican vacation by her old friend Delilah ""Dee"" Abraham (Whoopi Goldberg), a New York window dresser. They go for a week while Stella's young son Quincy (Michael J. Pagan) is spending time with his father. On her first morning in Jamaica, Stella catches the eye of handsome aspiring chef Winston Shakespeare (Taye Diggs), who is looking for a summer job at the resort while he contemplates medical school. While Dee keeps the company of two retired NFL players, Winston pursues Stella, a woman twice his age, until she agrees to a fling. They don't part on the best of terms, but that only makes it more obvious that the attraction was stronger than Stella bargained for.

Angela Bassett and Taye Diggs make a very attractive couple. But, alas, there is no chemistry. The characters' affection for one another was not in evidence. I found it impossible to imagine why they would want to be together in the long term. Stella and Winston have nothing in common, nor do they embody in each other characteristics that the other admires. He is too immature for her, and she is too controlling for him. They don't delight in making each other happy, which would solve a lot of their problems. They don't even seem to consider it. Beyond that, I found the story too polished and too contrived. An ordinary couple with a large age gap might have been interesting, but a monied stockbroker who walked right out of a magazine and the handsome son of equally monied parents dealing with the preppy sister, the broke sister, and the dying friend was beyond belief.",1507334400,,1721,4.7558528428093645

989621,5,630522207X,I have seen this movie several times and always enjoy it.  What I didn't enjoy however is the way the movie kept getting stuck and then would have to catch up to itself.  It even started itself over once.  Hopefully this can be fixed so that the next person that rents it doesn't experience the same.,1506038400,,300,4.321428571428571

989834,5,630522207X,As i was flicking through the stations one day I had caught the edning of the movie on BET! It seemed to be a love story or a drama one but I loved it! It is almost impossiable to go to walkmart or other stores that offer movies and find classics and older movies that are worth watching! Ialways turn to amazon. Not only do they always have the titles that i am looking for but the price is completely un-beatable! I orderied this movie and it came quickly. No scrathes or damges to the movie at all! great packaging! as for the movie i watched it two times the night i got it in the mail! A well established single black mother of a smart son has a bitter out look on life. she works hard and has for everything in her life. she never once lived by anything other than the rules in life. a very black and white style of doing things. she ends up going on vacation and meets someone the fall for each other they have a blast but you cant vacation for ever so they go back home to their real world but it is hard for them to get over the fun they had on vacation. basically by the end of the story they get together for a happy ending. love this movie! I didn't receive a discount or free item for my product or to make this review I paid full price.,1467763200,2,1250,4.004

990444,4,630522207X,"I like this movie a lot, but it's not nearly as awesome as the book, of course. Angela Bassett is excellent, and Whoopie Goldberg is funny, if underused, as her best friend. The scenery (actually filmed in Montego Bay, Jamaica) is outstanding, and Bassett gives you a sense of complex turmoil underneath it all. It is more than a little distracting that she is supposed to be in her 40's and is very clearly in her early 30's. Hollywood! Ugh! Could they at least have put a streak of gray in her hair? So annoying.

It's just kind of a bummer because in real life, the boy-toy husband ended up being gay. :(( Madonna does it better, she just dates them and dumps them when she's done with them. LOL Men have been dating women half their age for years and NOBODY bats an eye. Our Messed-Up Society.

You know, it's actually super-sad that a woman dating someone younger had to be such a big freakin' deal that they made a whole movie about it. Is that a 90's thing? Are we over this yet? Probably not.

If they came out with ""Cradle-Robber, The Movie"" people would be like, what's the point? Because Older man, Young woman: that basically IS every Hollywood movie!

990630,5,630522207X,"When Stella Payne (Angela Bassett), a forty-something African American and successful businesswoman, goes on a wild vacation to Jamaica, she gets more than she bargained for in the way of unconventional romantic interests. Stella soon falls in with a younger, more Jamaican crowd featuring the winsome Winston Shakespeare (Taye Diggs) - a hot black stud who soon shows up back in the USA. Sparks may be flying, but when life settles back down does the anomalistic coupling of a native-born American and Jamaican have a true future?

Drama is also high among Stella's conventional acquaintances - with whom she is shy to display her all-too-Jamaican boyfriend - and, while Winston appears comfortable in spite of the nationalistic disparity, it is all too obvious that Stella is not. Throw in a protective son (Michael Pagan) and life-long friend, the convivial and cancerous Delilah (Whoopli Goldblerg), and you've got the perfect formula for an engaging and plenary love story for everyone. Based on the novel by Terry McMillan and directed by the celebrated Kevin Sullivan (of ""Conviction"" and ""Barbershop 2: Back in Business""), ""How Stella Got Her Groove Back"" is both fun and political in a refreshingly unusual way.",1314230400,,1220,5.192893401015229

990789,1,630522207X,"As much as Angela Bassett, Whoopi Goldberg and Taye Diggs work together as a great cast, this film is boring, which they can't help because they're all wonderful actresses and actors, but the plot is just dull and boring.

The movie begins with a successful stockbroker in San Francisco, who decides from the urging of her best friend, ""Delilah,"" played by Whoopi Goldberg, that she needs a long-awaited vacation. So, while watching tv, she sees a commercial advertising travel to Jamaica, so ""Stella,"" played by Angela Bassett decides that as much as she deserves a vacation, finally succumbs to her best-friend's suggestion and flies down there and meets her best friend, ""Deliliah.""

The basic premise is a 40 year old woman falls in love with a much younger man, (old enough to be her son, no less) whose only 20. The 20 year old is named Winston Shakespeare, a native Jamaican, who decides to date ""Stella.""

At first, ""Stella"" (Angela Bassett) decides that dating a 20 year old man is robbing the cradle, but going against her better judgment, decides she'll throw caution to wind and date ""Winston.""

From the beginning of the film to the end the plot is boring, dull and uninteresting.

The characters like the plot are basic and boring. There's no real drama such as a hurricane taking place, or anything of that nature. While, the actors and actresses are talented not even their great acting abilities and personalities could save this film from being a complete failure, in my humble and honest opinion.

To recite a classic cliche, ""Not even the best popcorn can save this film"" and it's because of this that I give the film the lowest rating possiblg of only 1 star, which is extremely unusual for me because I almost always give films a 5-star rating because I enjoy so many movies, but this film just wasn't worth anything more than 1-star.

990790,2,630522207X,"Shawn got his snooze on watching How Stella Got her Groove back A great looking Angela Bassett strolling around the beaches of Jamaica in sexy swimwear just wasn't enough to keep me awake during this boring movie adapted from one of the weakest Terry McMillan novels. This movie was so forgettable that I saw it over a month ago and I kept forgetting to write the review for it.

Angela Bassett is Stella, a successful black stockbroker who thinks she's about to be promoted. In spite of her stellar work record, her bosses instead fire her citing financial troubles. (Plothole Ahead - why would a business that's in trouble fire one of their best employees? Wouldn't it have been smart to keep Stella there to turn the company around? Oh well, Terry needed a reason for Stella to go on vacation no matter how weak it was.) Tired and frustrated with the direction of her life, the divorced single mom decides to go to Jamaica for a vacation with a friend (Whoopi Goldberg) There she gets her hair braided and meets a hunky young chef (Taye Diggs) and over the slow course of the movie they have one of the most boring romances ever filmed. (does anyone in Hollywood know what PACING is?)

Soon after, Stella returns to the states and her man follows her. Stella continues to pursue the romance despite resistance from her 12-year-old son. The bosses at her old job want her back to work for them, Her new younger lover wants her to follow her dreams. At the end of the movie Stella gets her groove back with her younger man and decides to start her own trading business. Boring, boring boring.

The onscreen adaptation of Stella has all the elements of a great movie. The cinematography is great, showing us stunning visuals of Jamaica. The beaches were beautiful, the resorts looked like places I wanted to go. The casting is great; Angela Bassett and Whoopi Goldberg are strong enough to carry the movie. But the movie falls apart because the story is so predictable. Stella lacks the heart and soul of a true ""Terry McMillan"" story; it's the same by the numbers May/December romance story used in one of those horrible made for TV adaptations of a Danielle Steele or a Jackie Collins novel. By about the half hour mark the movie was losing its groove for me.

Angela Bassett gives it her all, but the weak script prevents her from giving a great performance. The whole movie is a waste of her time. Taye Diggs was looks great but his acting is horrible. He has absolutely no chemistry with Bassett and his Jamaican Accent goes on and off throughout the movie. In many scenes he's stiff and uneasy throwing off the romantic mood of the film. Whoopi Goldberg is just herself in this movie. She doesn't even act at all. Regina King is the only bright spot here. She plays her part extremely well overcoming the boring material.

If you're a romantic insomniac who wants to get your snooze on, Get into Stella's Groove. But if you're looking for a Black romance full of passion pick up Love Jones, Diary of a Mad Black Woman or How U Like me now. Those romances are full of passion and life.",1131321600,4,3090,4.56036036036036

I'll start by saying that I misread the title of this film to be 'How Stella Got Her Groovy Back'. I have been a fan of Angela Basset's back since 1990's 'Kindergarten Cop' in which she played 'Stewardess'. Expecting an interesting insight into how she fashioned her back into the exquisite example of lumbar beauty that it is today, I was disappointed to see just another film about a San Francisco stock broker who is persuaded by her colorful New York girlfriend Delilah to take a well deserved, first-class vacation to Jamaica. How many of these films do we need?

Complement your purchase of the movie with the novel; I hear it's even better!",1094601600,5,622,4.504424778761062

990795,1,630522207X,This movie was whack it was kinda of good but Taye Diggs cannot act Jamaican and he looked ugly! I bet you that Omar Epps could have done a better Jamaican. and the book was quadruple times better even more!,1073606400,3,207,4.2
990796,2,630522207X,"Someone just has to say this. When this movie was filmed in '97 (it was released in '98), Angela Bassett was barely 39 and Taye Diggs was almost 26. That is HARDLY the massive, upsetting, life-altering age difference suggested by the script or the novel it was based on. Furthermore, Angela Bassett is one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood (or anywhere for that matter), totally buff, and could probably pass, easily, for 28 or 29.
On the other hand, Taye Diggs, a very handsome guy, is no kid. He's a big guy, and mature looking and acting. I am sure he could have been cast easily in a part for a 30 or 35 year old.
So there is no discernable or meaningful age difference here and that queers the entire premise of the movie! Not to mention, just to confuse things more, Digg's character is shown to be from an affluent, educated family and headed for medical school. His work as a Jamaican ""pool boy"" is just a summer job.
This renders the whole concept a total cheat. It really would be shocking (and manipulative) if a rich, middle-aged woman from the US took sexual advantage of an uneducated young boy from a third world country. You'd see the sexual exploitation right off. It's so muffled here that we are drowning out any real thoughtfulness with our cries of ""you go, girl!""
A sobby subplot (very unbelievable) with Whoppie Goldberg addes nothing to the mix.
It is quite interesting how our culture accepts romances with older men/younger women without so much as a blink, but let a gorgeous fit woman in early middle age have a slightly younger boyfriend, and it's supposed to be a big deal. It isn't. And this movie isn't much of anything.
Try making a movie about the above issue (why it's OK for an old geezer to take a young trophy wife). That might be a challenging flick.
In short: a waste of film, except you get to watch Angela Bassett which is worthwhile anytime.",1072915200,9,1891,4.51603498542274

990886,3,630522207X,"Terry McMillan's followup to ""Waiting to Exhale,"" ""How Stella Got Her Groove Back,"" was dismissed by some critics as a fluffy beach romance novel.  It definitely had its spunk, but suffered from an overall blah-ness that weighed it down.  The movie version has similar problems.  Our heroine, played by the fierce talent that is Angela Bassett, is a broker trying to balance her career and being a single mom.  She, along with her best friend (Whoopi Goldberg), takes a vacation to Jamaica, where she falls for the striking Winston Shakespeare (Taye Diggs, whose Jamaican accent fades in and out throughout his otherwise solid performance).  The problem?  She's 40.  And he's 20.  You can pretty much imagine the issues these two have to face, as they decide whether or not to start a ""serious"" relationship.  ""How Stella..."" is a pleasant movie, despite the often sappy touches that almost mar the film.  The love story itself is fairly predictable, although the supporting roles from Suzzane Douglas and the always-dependable Regina King are pretty good.  Don't go looking to get blown away by this movie.  Like the novel on which it's based, it will pass your time nicely without requiring any deep thought.",1025136000,16,1210,4.995
990887,4,630522207X,"pI couldn't help but enjoy How Stella Got Her Groove Back, though it deals only in surface emotions. Many people prefer not to deal with issues anyway, and this is a perfect romantic comedy/drama for them. It is far superior to 1998's other tropical island movie, the clunky Six Days, Seven Nights.
It is always fun to see Angela Basset and Whoppi Goldberg, two of our greatest actresses, on the screen. Their careers are somewhat similar. Both have had difficulty in obtaining consistently good roles. Both have been nominated for Best Actress Oscars. Goldberg won for Best Supporting Actress in Ghost.
Stella [Bassett] is the forty year old working mother of a ten year old boy. A successful financial executive, she's become a workaholic. Her friends see that her life is unbalanced, and they urge her to liven it up. She resists, but, finally, reality hits home. On a whim, she calls her oldest friend, Delilah [Whoppi Goldberg], and suggests a week in Jamaica. She's due a vacation, and the son is going off to see his Dad. The two pals hop on a plane. Stella has no clue as to just how lively her life is about to become.
She meets a sexy, intelligent man named Winston [Taye Davis]. There is instant mutual attraction. The catch it that Winston is half her age. Encouraged by the spunky, outrageous Delilah, Stella decides to have a short affair. Catch number two arises when this odd couple realizes the relationship is much deeper than a casual island fling. Stella tries to force an arbitrary end to it and returns home.
This is the basis for the plot. Where will the relationship end? How can something so socially unacceptable ever work? I think many people enjoy stories about eccentric or unusual people and situations. A lot of us live conventionally out of fear or necessity, rather than out of a lifestyle preference. It pleases us to watch fictional characters who go beyond our relatively limited boundaries. Stella, Delilah and Winston are three of those characters.
As I said, the movie is short on substance. We never really know what motivates Stella or Winston. Issues come up, but are either quickly dropped or are given a simple solution, much like a TV sitcom. We enjoy the story, but at the conclusion, we realize we hardly know either Stella or Winston.
Jamaica is photographed at its very best. I was tempted to call my travel agent. Bassett and Davis do a fine job, considering the script limitations. Bassett, a Yale graduate, is a fish out of water in some of the scenes with Stella's down home family and friends. Goldberg fares better. Her role is smaller but more fleshed out. I hope some juicy roles come her way. She needs something more compelling than playing center square on TV's Hollywood Squares game.",1017187200,4,2745,4.756813417190775
990888,5,630522207X,"How Stella Got Her Groove Back is an amazingly refreshing movie with a stellar soundtrack and cast. It is the kind of movie that brings out so many different emotions in a person. It made me laugh, smile, and cry! The acting really brings the film to a higher level.

990890,3,630522207X,"This is the perfect brownie-point rental for guys when it comes to women you're dating: a cheesy chick-flick with such great cinematography (and enough shots of the ultra buff Taye Diggs naked for the ladies) that it's lot of fun. I say cheesy first of all because the script and setting were a diluted, cleaned up version of a great idea that has been done several times: woman turning forty falls in love with a man while on vacation who is (only) 21. Susan Sarandon did a movie with the exact same plot years ago.
The only problem is this: they made Angela Bassett's character, so incredibly perfect a woman, devoid of any issues to muddy the theme of the oh-so-pure-and-made-wrong-by-society's-hypocrises desire of an older woman to hit it with an impressionable young man, that no more than two percent of the female population in America could ever relate to her. A perfect size six, near-marathon running, happily divorced, high level stock broker...blissfully happy single mother, with an obvious million dollar home...NO issues whatsoever with her teenage son or ex husband...making at least a quarter million dollars a year... Oh, and of course, there are no real issues at her job either, where she is the only woman, not to mention Black woman, at her level in the corporation she's working for.  (Angela Bassett's character's life looks like a three dimensional version of what a lonely, overweight grad student female would write about herself in a personals ad for kicks while laughing with her girlfriends, wondering what hunks or losers would reply to it.) If you've ever been around a woman who, while talking about an issue she had, just gave you the feeling she was telling you the biggest most convoluted lie you've ever heard in order to keep something ugly a secret (and the secret thing really isn't as ugly as she's ironically making it out to be), imagine if she made a movie about herself, and you'd understand what gets in the way of your really liking this film as much as empathizing with the character's dilemma would want you to. If Bassett's character had at least ONE issue besides being an obvious workaholic (which of course is never explained as being an effect of some other issue's cause--when touched on at all after the first ten minutes), a normal everyday woman would be able to relate to her almost easily.  But nope, she's perfect; a consistent reminder that what you're watching isn't real.  And of course, though other men ignite the jealousies of Taye Diggs' character as they pursue Angela Bassett's while the two get deeper involved in the film, there wasn't a 20-year old, beautiful, intelligent, size six with aerobics-instructor boobies-type young Black woman within 20 miles of Taye Diggs to seriously inflame the jealousies or insecurities of Angela Bassett's character throughout the entire picture. That really covertly--or perhaps unconsciously--sent the wrong message to me about what the Sisterhood really consists of, when it comes to insecurity-based jealousies, image vs. inner self and sense of self worth, a woman's view of sexual attraction and the aging female body, and competition for a man in the woman's version of the real world.
In other words, the movie does a service by showing the world, once again, the sex-based hypocrisies of double standards when it comes to dating and falling in love in society, regarding ""May/December"" romances (its [somehow] okay for men to be Decembers but not women). And it does so with Whoopi being at the top of her game; she is hilarious all the way through, until she becomes as poignant as you've ever seen her near the end. But it balances out all that goodness--in fact, almost completely negates it--by the great disservice it does of making it all but impossible for an average woman to actually relate to this character, and what actual inner demons the average woman really would have to fight to have this kind of love in her life. It's almost as if they--our famous sister author/screenplaywright Terry McMillan and the director--are trying to show women a good time, but are actually saying subliminally ""By the way girl, you BETTER be a size six, six percent body fat, stock broker single mother with a six figure income, absolutely no regrets of a failed marriage and no Oedipal/codependency issues with your teenage son in a million dollar home, if you're gonna be forty years old and try to get with a 21 year old man."" That is something no man I know, 21 or otherwise, has any interest in saying to a woman, unless he's got some ugly axe to grind.  But you hear women saying the rough equivalent of that to themselves and each other virtually everyday. That, of course, just might have a woman feeling covertly worse about herself after the laughs and the Jamaican cinematography of this movie wear off.
But of course, what probably makes the movie still work is the same thing that makes an unbelieveably bad karate/action movie or spy thriller work for guys (like me): the suspension of disbelief for the benefit of bonding around an issue. This is the kind of movie a group of girls together would forgive all the bad stuff for and route for Angela right on through to the end. And it has some great moments.
NOT the movie to see if you're a normal woman who wants this kind of courageous love affair to actually work--and they can in the real world (when I was twenty-five, I was in love with a ""Stella"".) But fun for anyone else.",1008806400,2,5459,4.804255319148936

Angela Bassett is a great and gorgeous actress, and Taye Diggs is soooo hot- ladies, it is worth buying this movie just to rewatch him  in that shower scene near the end!  However, I felt like I couldn't always sympathesize with the main character because I found her selfish at times.  The part with Whoopie Goldberg, whose on-screen character was her best friend, was very good and sad, but I felt as if the main character was having too much fun focusing on her boyfriend and her trips to Jamaica to care about her best friend when she needed it most.  I felt the same was true about her son, and about how she treated her boyfriend at times when she was experiencing difficulty at work.  Furthermore, I felt there were some awkward and underdeveloped parts... I don't want to give anything away for those of you who haven't seen it, so I will just say that there were some surprise scenes that were successful surprises but that really should have had some beginning line of plot for the viewer's interest.  Certain scenes are melodramtic and unrealistic, but I guess that's what a romantic movie is all about. :)  This movie, although containing flaws which I have mentioned above, is worth watching because of the good acting, the beautiful scenery, the heart-swooning love scenes and story, and the sappy ending.  (And... have I mentioned Taye Diggs!  :)  If you are in the mood for a relaxing and romantic evening, snuggle up with ""How Stella Got Her Groove Back"".

Will the relationship last beyond the initial thrill of romace in sunny, exotic Jamaica?  Will it work in ""real life"" - after the vacation is over?  These may be somewhat cliched questions, but the clever (and amazingly funny!) writing and excellent acting (with a little help from Whoopie Goldberg as the warm and humorous ""best friend"") make the whole film a delight to watch!

I didn't  think that the chemistry between Winston (Taye Diggs) and Stella was very  magical, at least not like in the book, but I thought they made a nice  pairing thanks to Bassett's performance.

In this unconventional romantic tale, Stella is a divorced  40-year-old careerswoman with an adolescent son, yet she is also such a  BEAUTIFUL modern-day Egyptian queen who leads a rich, fulfilling life and  is quite lucky to have very good, loving friends who keep prodding her  along whether she tries to hold back.

What  I find borish about the film is that I just couldn't feel any chemistry  between the two. Maybe it is because of mr. diggs who is a terrible actor.  His posturing and facial expressions are terribly generic. You can't tell  if he is angry, happy or having an orgasm there is little difference. Then  there is that pathetic accent which he seems to turn on and off with each  scene and is never convincing. Maybe they should have stuck him in a room  and forced him to watch ""The harder they come"" about 50 times  untill he got it right.  As for Bassett's performance, pure brilliance! She  is the most stunning character I have seen in some time. You can actually  believe her emotion and her beauty is incredible. In a strange way the  disparity between her substantial performance and the weak poor performance  from diggs makes the show work. It helps to emphasize their differences.  She is twice his age, has a career and money. He is just 20 and poor. Of  course such a relationship couldn't work and it basically doesn't.
