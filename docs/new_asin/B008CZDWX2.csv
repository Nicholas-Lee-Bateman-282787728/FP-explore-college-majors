5152849,4,B008CZDWX2,"Good transfers ( except for "" Quo Vadis ""). "" The King and I "" has an extremely wide aspect ratio. I bought this for "" Bonjour Tristesse "" which looks wonderful. ( Make sure you turn off the subtitles before you watch the films.)",1472256000,6,229,4.111111111111111
5152850,1,B008CZDWX2,"One of the six disks was damaged, bent so horribly no device I own was able to play it. The kicker is that it wasn't even a DVD that was supposed to be sold in this collection. The missing DVD was Julius Caesar. I am stuck with incomplete set.",1450569600,3,243,3.979591836734694

5152853,5,B008CZDWX2,"My granddaughter is 17 years young, cool, hip and in with the in-crowd.  She loves Deborah Kerr and all of the classic movies in this set.. Classic movies made in the classic, decent way.  And plenty of fun, besides.",1421798400,7,216,4.512820512820513
5152854,5,B008CZDWX2,"From Here to Eternity - Kerr was top-billed along with Lancaster in this roll-in-the-surf movie, but Donna Reed actually had more face-time. Still, it's a movie not to be missed. The King & I - well, it's classic Kerr-Brynner and well-beloved and enduring in charm. Bonjour Tristesse is a sad film the pairs Kerr with David Niven in an tale of a father-daughter relationship that borders on dependency leading to manipulations that turn out disastrously; Julius Ceasar - well, it's the full blown Shakespeare play and gets ponderous. Most stage productions cut most of the war scenes and deal mainly with the political intrigue. If you love the bard, you'll still likely be on bard-overload by the end; still, you can skip the long dialogues and enjoy the ""high school"" version that used to be textbook mandatory reading; Quo Vadis - who can ever forget the beautiful Lygia tied to a post in the Roman arena while Robert Taylor and the giant battle to save her life? Kerr is beautiful, of course, and Taylor handsome, but the tale is not Biblically faithful, though it is lavish and one of my favorite films from my childhood. Of course i watch it over and over again.",1370908800,8,1168,4.730392156862745
5152855,5,B008CZDWX2,"I began my quest to own the majority of Deborah Kerr films last October.  I have a serious girl crush on this phenomenal actress and have a major interest in all things Deborah Kerr.  Anyway, I could have saved a lot of dough and had a lovely boxed set had I just waited for this.  I've seen all of these films and they are Deborah Kerr at her finest.  ""Black Narcissus"" and ""From Here to Eternity"" really made her a star and those are two films that I never get tired of watching.  Deborah Kerr was not only visually stunning, but a powerhouse talent in showing the simmering sensuality of her characters as well as their gentle humanity.  I love all of the nuances that she conveys just by using her eyes or those beautiful hands. I just may buy this set just to have the cool box even though I already own most of these films.",1346976000,5,829,4.248407643312102
