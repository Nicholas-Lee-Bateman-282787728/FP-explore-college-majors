8685397,1,B00OYT32BW,"Dr. Steve Austen is, indeed a geologist with a PHD in ""sedimentary geology"" from Penn State.  He is also the ""Senior Research Scientist"" for the ""Institute for Creation Research.""  This DVD is part of a series called ""The Flood Geology DVD Series,"" which attempts, using a few real, scientific facts and a lot of quasi-religious ""theory"" to back the ""Biblical record"" (his words) that even the Grand Canyon was created by a great flood, NOT that it took millions of years of erosion to create. Interesting ideas, but if you are looking for scientific and historic accuracy, This Isn't It! There is some beautiful and spectacular footage I have not seen before. With the sound turned off, and if you are an amateur or armchair volcanologist, it might be worth the purchase price.",1501113600,,778,4.842105263157895
8685398,5,B00OYT32BW,"Eye opening information not readily available to the general public.  Evolutionists are (not surprisingly) quiet about the implications of Mount St. Helens when applied to the Grand Canyon, etc.",1492646400,2,194,5.689655172413793
8685399,5,B00OYT32BW,The last video any evolutionist wants to show his/her students!  Yahweh (God) Himself provides the evidence to refute the absurdity of evolution.,1489017600,,145,5.590909090909091

8685403,5,B00OYT32BW,"I liked the presentation.  Although Mt St Helens is smaller in scale, it gives credence to catastrophic explanations of the geological evidence.

The evidence of vertically buried trees in the lake bottom sediments--That can explain why some tree trunk fossils are found verticle in the geological column, spanning several layers, which normally represent thousands/millions of years based on naturalistic/uniformitarian assumptions.",1450310400,,433,6.2
