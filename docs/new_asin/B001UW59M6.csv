3812965,4,B001UW59M6,"I had ordered this because of Patrick Bauchau (in two great movies of late - Gray Man and Chrysalis) but I was actually surprised in not having heard about this film otherwise. It is a solid film in the noir category, but also manages to cover some other themes with tragedy and narrated over-indulgence. The cover art puts this as a Goodfellas meets Chinatown, which yes there are gangsters, tragic bloodlines, fate and love lost, but this has to stand alone in its own little category of a freshman tragedy film like no other. The director, writer and main star are all first timers (I don't count their short film from 10 years ago) and I think they made a watchable film.

The story follows our main character as he seeks retribution, revenge and paternal knowledge to his existence, as all he has known is pain, mobsters and more pain. The first 25 minutes of the film are a long narration about his birth into a crime family and painful adolescence. Lots of flashbacks, lots of angst, and lots of violence. If you can keep track of the genealogy thrown at you for this long, then the constant beatings and killings this character partakes in later, can be a welcome change.

The filming is well done, the narration and writing are heavy, but they manage to get some self-aware moments in there that make you laugh, and at the same time make you realize they aren't taking themselves too seriously. The sound can be either 5.1 or 2.0, and a small picture gallery is included. Would have preferred for there to be supplements and a cleaner picture, but it is still a recommendation. The humorous supporting cast make for a well-rounded noir that I think most supporters of this genre will like (the doctor describing to his victims how they are dying as he kills them, the vigilante cop that kicks a perp down the city hall steps, the philosophical physician that works better after shooting up, etc.)

This film did not get the best reviews, but I think it is worth a shot.",1244937600,11,1978,4.581920903954802

3812967,5,B001UW59M6,"Caught this film in theatres a few weeks back, action packed, crime noir.  beautifully shot dreamscape, takes you on a ride while Roselyn Sanchez mesmorizes the screen.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1243468800,4,189,5.482758620689655

3813049,2,B001UW59M6,"The cinematography of this film is amazing. Unfortunately, that is the only good thing the movie has.

The writing is horrible. The voice over tells a choppy full of holes story over a two hour span that could of been conveyed in 5 minutes. The characters are all the definition of one dimension. They could each be summed up in a short blip on a single index card. The actors try to make up for the lack of substance by adding dramatically fake emotion to cliche card board cut-outs that feel out of context.

If you took about 20 images from the movie and hung them in an art museum, I'd say they were great. As a movie though, it feels like a film school student's best attempt to get a C.",1345593600,,692,4.234848484848484

3813052,3,B001UW59M6,"This review is for the Amazon VOD rental of this film. This film is very hit and miss.
The film is well shot with some beautiful scenes. I found the narrative over every scene
to be a drawback. The narrator/main character seems to speak non-stop without telling
the viewer much of anything. I give the film high points on ambition but it fails to
deliver on it. I have to say Roselyn Sanchez is a very good actress and such a lovely
woman but even she can not overcome the material she is working with.",1290470400,5,502,4.294736842105263
3813053,1,B001UW59M6,"Perfect Sleep is ridiculous. It wants to be every noir ever made, using all their tropes and cliches while thinking it's both celebrating and mocking the genre in its sad post-modernist deconstructive cinematic onanism.

What emerges (barely) from this ooze is a well-shot film that looks good but feels like a failed term project from a fine cinematographer saddled with a crappy writer who thinks he can laugh at noir conventions while providing none of their satisfactions. The narrative goes non-stop the first 20 minutes and is pointlessly twisted, giving us zero reason to care about anyone or anything. Part of the joy of noir is being SPARE...not throwing every narrative idea and the kitchen sink as well into the pot.

The acting is a joke, ditto the direction. Watch The Big Sleep or Chinatown or The Maltese Falcon or DOA or Double Indemnity and then watch this for some true perspective. They are art at a high level; this is pretension at a high level.

Absolutely unrecommended for any fan of noir, unless you want to turn off the sound and make up your own story and dialogue. Not a bad idea, actually. You could not do worse than this Perfect Mess.",1278633600,13,1165,4.729064039408867
3813054,1,B001UW59M6,This is the kind of movie that makes stupid people feel smart for liking.  Pretentious with a capital P!,1265500800,2,104,4.473684210526316
3813055,5,B001UW59M6,"I am so sorry I was unable to see this 'Bigger than Life' movie in the theater on the Big Screen!  The first time through this wonderful movie was a bit confusing for me. Thank goodness I could just play it again and experience it a second time in the comfort of my family room.  Picking-up on the nuisance, subtle dialogue and humor required more than one viewing (for me); I was not prepared for all the action and ""hidden messages"".  A true ART FILM and beautifully done!  Anton Pardoe is FABULOUS and, of course, Roselyn Sanchez is beyond gorgeous/enchanting!",1264377600,5,563,4.6
3813056,3,B001UW59M6,"The cinematography is classic and extremely stylish (if self-indulgent) film noir. The plot provides excellent opportunities to intrigue us. The narrative of the unnamed protagonist-assassin is overblown in the extreme -- at times lending structure to the plot and at other times ranging from enigmatic to incomprehensible.

The assassin without a name (who is part samarai, part kick boxer, and part masochist) loves a beautiful woman he was raised with -- why? There are so many questions about why somebody wants to kill someone else? Interesting characters who seem significant drop in for a few minutes until they are killed without clear motives. Ultimately, he must kill or be killed by the man who raise him or the woman he loves, but can never possess, will be killed.

The plot is more Russian than anything else, and the movie untimately inhabits that uneasy space between action movie and film noire. While the acting and directing is very solid, the movie is overall far too pretentious, and its self-indulgence ultimately spoils an otherwise satisfactory ending. The sound track was also indecipherable at times.

That said, the actors all give fine performances in this ultimately unsatisfying movie, and the locations and cinematography make this a worthy view.",1255910400,9,1277,5.219512195121951
3813057,5,B001UW59M6,A beautifully told love story that deserves a much wider audience. Why Anton Pardoe is not a world-famous actor/writer is the real unanswered mystery after watching this film.,1249344000,,175,5.285714285714286

8345232,1,B001UW59M6,"I purchased this because I wanted to see another movie with Roselyn Sanchez.  I think she's a talented actress, very beautiful, and I have enjoyed her in Without a Trace and Devious Maids.  But this monstrosity is unfathomable.  The voice-over narration is annoying and monotonous.  There is no story or character development.

I watched it three times in succession, yet I still have no idea what the point was.  I went to imdb and tried to give a chance before watching it a second time.  Alas, this movie is hopeless.  And what a shame for several fine actors that appear in it.",1391040000,,581,4.627450980392157
