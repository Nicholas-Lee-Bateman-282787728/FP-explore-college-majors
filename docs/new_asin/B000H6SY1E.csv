2630089,5,B000H6SY1E,"I was so excited when I heard this was coming out, I just had to have it, so I told my husband to get it for me for an early Christmas present!

It's so great, I really like ""Whimper and Whine"" and ""Sweet, Sweet, Sway"", but the whole set is incredible!

I really wish ""T-I-O-N"" and ""L-Y song"" were on here too, but oh well, I sure hope they put out another box set, that would be nice!

It's a must have, it certainly helped me, I only hope it'll help my son someday too!

The in between commentaries with the former stars is GREAT, they look so different, but sound the same especially Skip, and Jim!

Buy it today, you'll be glad you did!(I know I was) :-)!!!!!",1165104000,,663,4.108527131782946
2630090,5,B000H6SY1E,"It's amazing how well this show has held up.  I never missed it growing up and am so thankful that unedited episodes are available on DVD.  If there is a volume 3 (I think there will be since volume 1 suprisingly sold well, and vol. 2 will do likewise), there should be a Friday episode from season 4 so we can see the production credits.  They haven't been seen since their original airing so it will be worth it.  Also, more season 1 Friday shows with the now classic Love of Chair segment over the credits.  Apparently, the boy (Skip Hennat), does different things over the credits (including falling asleep!!).  I will stick by that this show (and Sesame Street) are FAR better than any show you will find for kids.  From Barney to Bob the Builder to Spongebob; these shows are idiotic and I would rather die than show these shows to kids.  Shows produced by CTW are the ONLY shows that I would recommend to kids.  I have learned though that some of the episodes have been slightly altered (particularly some of the Spidey segments) but that shouldn't stray people away from this set.",1164758400,20,1088,4.510204081632653
2630091,5,B000H6SY1E,"Once again, Sesame Workshop (or Children's Television Workshop as I like to still think of it) and Shout Factory came up with the goods for another winning DVD box set of The Electric Company.  Heads-up warning: If you are expecting to see a PBS logo at the end of the 1975 documentary shot entirely on film showing teachers' employment of the show in the classroom, there isn't one.  Strange, and I was told this was a prime-time special for PBS.  The PBS I.D. logo was added to the master tapes of just about everything they distributed to their member stations.  But it still appears at the end of the episodes, just like on the previous DVD box set.  Judy Graubart's (Jennifer Of The Jungle) hair has colored considerably since the series' final show in 1977.  Jim Boyd (J. Arthur Crank, Paul The Gorilla, voice of Lorelei The Chicken) doesn't appear to have aged too much, even with sporting eyeglasses now.  Skip Hinnant (Fargo North, Decoder) has gray hair at 66, but his voice still sounds like it did during the series' run.  He had about the same hair color I do when he was my current age of 35.  There are 40 episodes officially released on DVD now, another 740 to go until the whole series is covered.  I really do hope this DVD box set does as well as the first one did to warrant a third volume DVD box set, and many others after that.  That next set should include interviews with Lee Chamberlin, Bill Cosby, Morgan Freeman, Melanie Henderson (Kathy of The Short Circus), Stephen Gustafson (Buddy of The Short Circus).  A side note to the New Jersey educator that reviewed the first DVD box set; I did find the PBS logo bumper with its Moog synthesizer theme a bit scary when I was a kid.  Looking at it in my maturity, it's still a bit scary to me but also exciting at the same time.

2630092,5,B000H6SY1E,"If your children are learning to read, then you owe it to them to buy one or both both DVD sets of the Electric Company.  It's hard to exaggerate how much my daughters (ages 4 and 6) enjoy watching these episodes, or how much they have learned as a result.  When volume 2 arrived at my home last week, my girls were screaming and jumping up and down with excitement.

And while they certainly enjoy the comedy and the music, it's very clear that the lessons have been sinking in; just a few nights ago, my 6-year-old wowed us with a demonstration of ""dinner"" vs. ""diner."" She has similarly learned to handle punctuation, silent E, and common letter combinations, long before these subjects were introduced in school.  I'm generally quite skeptical of claims regarding ""educational television,"" but the Electric Company demonstrates that it can work.

The inclusion of some classic bits, including Julia Grownup and the LY song, is greatly appreciated.  And of course, we're enjoying Letterman and (the surprisingly small number of episodes with) Spiderman.

For most of my family, the second set of DVDs means that we now have 40 fabulous episodes to choose from, rather than just 20.  But for me, as someone who grew up with this show, it was nice to see interviews with many of the cast members.  And yes, it was a bit surprising to see how they've aged -- but I'm also 30 years older than I was in the 70s, so it's only fair!  The documentary about teachers' use of the show was a bit long and dry, but still a worthwhile addition.

Even without the extras, this DVD set would be well worth the price.  Your kids will learn to read, and they'll laugh and sing as they do so.  I can't recommend The Electric Company highly enough; buy it, and you'll see what I mean.",1163980800,13,1768,4.556962025316456
2630093,5,B000H6SY1E,"What struck me was how old the other actors have gotten.  OMG!

Anyways, each of the other actor's - Louis Avlos, Skip Hinnant, Hattie Winston, Judy Graubart and Jim Boyd introduce the episodes as well as the trivia bits in between episodes.

What's even nicer is those ""missing"" sketches appear to be on here: ex. ""Sweet Sweet Sway"", ""Phantom of Love"", ""Grease This Town"", ""We are out of Sweet Rolls"", ""Happy Birthday Miss Jones Cartoon"" ""The Six Dollar & Thirty Nine Cent Man"", Julie Grown Up (aka Julie The Cook), ""The Kid's  A Hot Shot"" Song, etc.

It's also nice to sample a little more episodes from the 2nd season.

Of course there are definately a bunch of repeat sketches/cartoons like ""I would Die For A Piece of Your Pie"", ""Unlock Your Love, Unbutton Your Mind"", ""Right On"", ""Silent E"", ""Grin (w/ Louis Avlos), Skip Hinnant Blind Folded with each cast member handing him an object that starts with ""GR"", ""Sneeze, Snore, Sniff"" song, and many more.

Unfortunately there are a few sketches/songs still missing in action such as Tom Lerher's version of ""The L-Y Song"", ""Sock Hop"" song, and ""Billy Lick-A-Lolly"".

Still it's a very entertaining set - hopefully we'll see a third volume someday!

Bottom Line: We All Get Old!  --- oops no I mean This is another great set!!!  Better buy it if you have the first one!",1160956800,8,1322,4.67965367965368

The Electric Company is absolutely the greatest educational program ever made for kids.

Please keep those Volumes coming.  My children are learning so much from this show.  No show out there today is as wonderful as this one.  The tunes are catchy and the kids are really learning new words, Punctuation, and language concepts.  The skits are a great way to learn. Thank you again for offering more.  Please keep them coming.

2630112,3,B000H6SY1E,"Best of Electric Company Volume 1 is really great. There is a lot of great stuff in Volume 2. But it could have been so much better. It seems to have been put together without much thought. There were NEARLY 800 EPISODES of E.C. made in the 1970s. Even given the fact that, out of necessity, they often repeated skits, it should be more than mathematically possible to produce two 20-episode collections in which there are NO REPEATED SKITS. And yet, on every disk of Volume 2 there are episodes that repeat skits that were in episodes on Volume 1. And as others have noted, some really obvious classic things, like the -LY song, are not included. Obviously my 2-year old doesn't notice or care about this, and obviously I have slightly more important things to do than relive my childhood TV-watching hours, but one can't help but feeling taken advantage of by the Shout Factory, or whoever is responsible for putting these together. I would gladly have gone without (as would my 2-year old) the alternately boring and sanctimonious intro sections by cast members if that had given the production crew more time to choose a real variety of episodes. It's irritating to pay a premium for nostalgia/quality children's programming (E. C. is both) only to find that it was lazily put together. Oh well. Now back to Love of Chair!",1379721600,3,1326,4.719827586206897
2630113,4,B000H6SY1E,"These old-school Electric Company shows are still a crack-up, and kids love them.  Morgan Freeman did a wonderful job.

2630114,2,B000H6SY1E,The Electric Company is just one of the most amazing shows ever made.  It is such a great way to help children who love to learn and those who don't love to learn.  I was so excited when I bought this in 2006.  But then I watched it with my kids.  Every single one has an introduction by a cast member!  I didn't even want to watch it.  Boring!  So dissappointed.  They should have had an option to watch with introductions or without.  I know my daughter would have loved it and learned so much but instead neither kid wanted to watch because of the boring part so they would always watch something else unless I was with them to forward over the talking.,1362960000,5,656,4.225806451612903

It is funny, educational, and it really works in a very simple way to help the kids to read.  They find it just as corny as it is, but that's the fun of it.  They laugh out loud and read along.

2630132,4,B000H6SY1E,"I bought both Volume 1 & 2 for my three preschool-age sons (ages 4 & 5 ). While both are EXCELLENT in every respect, I think the Volume 1 compilation is slightly better than Volume 2. Volume 1 has a bit better variety. Volume 2 spends too much time with some of the more boring skits. That being said, my boys love both sets and are taking leaps and bounds in their reading ability. This series is amazing in its ability to educate and entertain ALL age ranges. As a parent, I genuinely enjoy watching it too.

Now with Vol 2...I am GLAD that they have a separate songs sections...My *OLD* kids LOVE the songs...Sweet Sweet Sway, Boom, Knock Knock Rock, and Whimper and Whine are their fivs...while the Greedy Greg segment and The Short Circus and Rita Moreno song about the E on the End is my favorite.

Having worked with each other for a long time, the skits are tighter and the comedy is even better.  We see less of Bill Cosby, as his career has taken off by this point.  ""The Adventures of Letterman"", narrated by Joan Rivers, is still there, as well as Molly, the Rita Moreno character who screams ""Hey you guys!!!"" at the top of her lungs at the bginning of each show.  What impressed and continues to impress me about ""The Electric Company"" is how technologically simple it is, in present day standards, that is.  Yet, and perhaps because of this simplicity, the child who watches these shows is able to learn, and WANTS to learn to read.  I believe that the secret of the success of the show lies in the fact that  kids are watching adults who could very well be their teachers enjoy themselves thoroughly while not only learning, but also by teaching how to learn effectively while still having fun.",1169078400,5,1047,4.566844919786096

I haven't even seen all the episodes on here yet, but when I saw the ""Here's Cooking at You"" segment with Julia Grownup, I nearly fell on the floor laughing!  The recipe (to teach kids the middle ll sound) was for ""Grilled Dill Pickles With Chilled Vanilla Filling"".  Judy Graubart winds up ad-libbing a lot in this sketch, which makes it even funnier.  I won't ruin it for you if you haven't seen it, but if you like the Muppets' Swedish Chef, you'll like this sketch, too.  Judy, you made my day.  I haven't laughed so hard in days.

The rest of the shows on these discs are just as funny, witty, innovative, and educational as they were all those years ago.  I hope the staff in charge of TEC know that they have made a great difference in a lot of kids' lives as they learn to read.  The cast gets to talk some about their experiences as well.  They also introduce the episodes, too!  Too much, man!

I love to read to this day, and I know that the Electric Company was a big influence on that! ;)  At one part, Skip Hinnant (Fargo North Decoder) said that people come up to him and say ""You know, you taught me to read.""  Well, he taught me, too.
