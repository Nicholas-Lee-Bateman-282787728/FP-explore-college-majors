8535562,1,B00945IG9E,"Horrible! I should have asked for my money back, and meant to.  It was just words on a screen that little kids were reading, and not that well.  Some of the words did not even match.what they were saying.  And some lines from one story were just ""dropped"" into other stories. It was as if someone had just made this at home with their kids with no professional production values at all.  If I could give it negative stars, I would do so.  Was hoping for something nice for an early Sunday morning with a visiting niece, and instead it was just embarrassing.",1372032000,3,557,4.368932038834951
8535563,5,B00945IG9E,"We bought this for the kids, but i enjoy listening and watching to the Bible stories, too!  The voices of the kids reading these stories are sweet and soothing and just sweet to listen to!  The stories are beautifully colored.  We liked it so much we bought more for Christmas gifts!

Great job WonderVista!  Thanks for producing a wholesome, enjoyable, educational product!",1356566400,2,374,4.967741935483871
