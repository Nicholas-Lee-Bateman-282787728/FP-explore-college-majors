2457416,4,B000CCW2NE,"Mexican writer/director Leopoldo Laborde has made a number of low budget, challenging, controversial films, using his cadre of nonprofessional actors and crew and he is gathering a following for his courage and his unique style. SIN DESTINO is a good introduction to his work - a film about the seamy side of Mexico City's life told with verismo style that at times is difficult to watch but yet one that succeeds in conveying his story well.

Using a combination of black and white with intervals of color photography, SIN DESTINO follows the life of a fifteen-year old Francisco/Frank (Francisco Rey) who has been a sex worker since his desperate introduction to the desires of older men when he was nine years old. He regularly engages in same sex activity for money to pay for a drug habit that is out of control. His friend and dealer is the understanding David (David Valdez) who 'loans' Frank money and coke when Frank is desperate, but also feels the need to get Frank out of the sex market by introducing him to women: David believes that once Frank has sex with a woman he will forego his street ways and have a chance at life. Frank happens to view a blonde girl Angelica (Mariana Gaja) and for the first time feels attraction to women. David sets Frank up with a kind-hearted prostitute Perla (Sylvia Vilchis) who offers Frank understanding and tenderness even though Frank is unable to perform. Frank has disturbing dreams and visions of his initial initiation into the male hustler life by an older child pornographer Sebastian (Roberto Cobo) and these intensely ugly memories are mixed with his delusions of sexual encounters with Angelica: these scenes appear in color and make a fine contrast in the 'magical realism' vein.

David encourages Frank to bed Angelica and sells him (through money he will retrieve from an incidental reunion with Sebastian) a love potion that will assure his sexual success with Angelica. Frank visits Sebastian after a six-year absence, obtains the money through violent means, and has his desired hook up with Angelica that results in a cruel tragedy that completes the film. David remains at Frank's side through the sequelae that follow and the film ends on a dark note that all but extinguishes Frank's hope for a favorable destiny.

Laborde knows what he wants and opts for a crude, rough, seemingly spontaneous non-rehearsed style of acting from his crew. He is able to draw from Francisco Rey an empathetic character, a lad who is stuck in the quagmire of the slim that faces the poor kids of the big city. Laborde is even able to make his 'evil johns' such as Sebastian more than simply dark caricatures. His cinematographer Jorge Rubio Casar&iacute;n is at all times in sync with Laborde's vision, even though the camera use is inordinately distracting with its play of light and dark at times. It is only after the film is over that Laborde's use of the fate, death and love potion motifs from Wagner's 'Tristan und Isolde' are appreciated, and that is an example of how much energy the writer/director has in his visions, a trait that suggests he may become a significant force in Mexican film-making. The film contains considerable violence, nudity, simulated sex scenes, drug use and harsh language, but one cannot imagine this story being told without those elements.

2457417,3,B000CCW2NE,"I thought the movie was excellent despite it's ""student film"" qualities ... maybe that contributed to my perception.  The subject matter might be disturbing for some.  The commentaries and other extras was quite interesting and gave a lot of insight.  It is a pity the video quality of the DVD is even worse than VHS; I couldn't figure out if it was by design or just because of a bad transfer.  I found the Spanish hard to understand, apart from not speaking it well, it was difficult to hear the words. The subtitling was adequate, although not very well formated.",1181779200,4,566,4.63

2457420,4,B000CCW2NE,This is a well done low-budget tribute to the great Luis Bunuel.. It is a sad movie of a boy who does not have many choices.. He is used and abused and he is addicted to a way of life that does harm to himself.. This is one of the saddest movies you will ever see as it evokes a harsh reality of life on the streets.. It is filmed in gorgeous black and white and the camera is has an unshakeable gaze.,1170288000,7,401,3.8433734939759034
2457421,4,B000CCW2NE,"This is a movie about children from the streets. This movie hasn't great production resourses, but it has a good argument.

It's a touching movie, it has strong scenes not for people under 16, also it has sexual content and may be offensive for some people who use to deny the reality.

Est es una pelcula acerca de nios de la calle. Esta movie quiz no tiene grandes recursos de procuccin, pero tiene un buen argumento.

2457423,5,B000CCW2NE,"This movie takes a hard and believable look at the desperate life of the poor youth in a megacity environment.  The acting is stunning - especially the lead Francisco Rey, and the cinemetograhy stark and real.  This brings to life the story of what youth do to survive and the corresponding story of the people who prey on them.  Worth seeing and probably more real and common than most of us will ever see first-hand.  It is a hard story, yet never loses the glimmer of optimism and hope that keeps people going.  All the characters are brought to life as real and complete humans.

Be sure to check out the ""deleted scenes"" and the ""directors commentary"" especially regarding the deceased film star Roberto Cobo and why he had to turn down the invitation to Cannes.

PPS This movie is not at all a gay movie.  That characterization is misleading.",1140825600,23,848,4.6066666666666665

8097594,5,B000CCW2NE,"The quality of the DVD movie itself is average.  In addition, some viewers may find the examples of illicit sexuality offensive.  However, this is a foreign film produced by a foreign Director, who presents in stark reality, the environment of poverty in his own country, and boy who grows up with no future - no destiny.  I commend the producer for intellectual honesty in presentations of the realities where boys are preyed up by adults for sex.  In turn, some of the boys become involved in boy/man male prostitution to support an illegal drug addiction, which will follow them into adulthood that is a life with no destiny.  This movie illustrates attending problems such as corruption and no reliable rule of law on the streets where only the rich and poor live.  Improvement in a society must come from within, not just from outside sources.  Roberto Cobo reveals all of those realities with style in the media.",1395619200,,918,4.808917197452229
8097595,5,B000CCW2NE,"A couple of years ago I purchased this movie made in Mexico City.  I just viewed it again a couple of days ago.  Boy is it gritty but it tells the story of the most famous Richard Wagner Opera ""Tristan und Isolde"" about an illicit love affair.  Can you think of anything more illicit now-a-days than the love affair between a 9-year-old boy and an aging male artistic photographer who photographs and beds the boy?  It is a struggle to the death.  And, a life of loss the boy lover who was left completely devastated and alone.

Sin Destino  Trailer: [...]  Turn your sound down.  Not for the faint of heart.  A love story of illicit love .. the most illicit today.

I have been watching the actual opera done by the Bayreuther Festspiele Orchester in Vienna: [...]  Makes me wish to move to Chicago more and more to be able to hear pieces like this in world class music halls.  Once got to hear the Berlin Symphony do Brahmas in Chicago.  I want you to know the music hall started vibrating before you could hear anything.  Never experienced anything like that.  This piece of Tristan und Isolde Prelude ""Love Death"" [...]  is played during the film Sin Destino: Pure Beauty.  SADNESS!!!

Bravo Leopoldo Laborde!!!!!!",1323216000,,1218,4.5813953488372094
8097596,3,B000CCW2NE,"There is a lot of Christianity in this film, its perspective.  The boy, a hustler in a big city, is almost a sacrifice, being offered up to customers.  There are some themes of redemption and doubt, but they're not explored as much as they could have been.  It is a film that is knowledgeable about grittiness without losing sight of some grace within.  Another film like this that comes to mind, that deals with themes of religion and its confrontation with queerness in Catholic latino culture, is ""Our Lady of the Assassins""",1308873600,2,527,4.695652173913044
8097597,5,B000CCW2NE,Sin Destino follows the old school realistic and at times crude and cruelty that make el cine mexicano the best in the 50's . The movie was filmed black and white just to give that extra little of realism. The subject of the movie I would say is the average of a perv that lives in a 3 world country and the way a normal teenager would act drugged and with grudge in his heart.,1258588800,,377,4.04
