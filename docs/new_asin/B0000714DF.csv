8322395,4,B0000714DF,"The title says it all that U2 is back to the kind of music their known for, great guitar work by The Edge and soaring vocals from Bono this song reminds me that U2 isn't going to leave the music scene. This DVD includes the music video to ""Electrical Storm"" the video is not very different from previous because U2 has always been creative with their videos using very creative directors such as one of my favs ""One"" a must see if you like U2 all in all this DVD is a nice dolby 5.1 version or you could get the ""Best Of U2 1990 - 2000"" which includes many other U2 videos including this one.",1040601600,3,592,4.112068965517241
