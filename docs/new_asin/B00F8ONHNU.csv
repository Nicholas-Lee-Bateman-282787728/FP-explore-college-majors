5970613,5,B00F8ONHNU,"The best thing about ""The Trouble with Barry"" is how it holds me, tenderly, at night as a crimson sun plunges deep into the recesses of Hollywood's Los Feliz area.  Also, it plans to run for local government in an attempt to curb gang violence in Beverly Hills.",1379808000,5,261,4.4375
5970614,5,B00F8ONHNU,"The Trouble with Barry has a major advantage in the low-budget campy gay comedy horror genre. Barry is played by Peter Stickles, who is indie gold! His resume includes Shortbus, Evil Bong 3, Gingerdead Man 3, Showgirls 2, BearCity, and many more. He was also the evil vampire on the gay horror series The Lair!

And of course, the opening scene of this movie features B-horror queens Linnea Quigley, Michelle Bauer, and Brinke Stevens. The Trouble with Barry is cult comedy with a slasher film subplot. Barry is being stalked by Bette Midler, played by Craig Taggart from the Sordid Lives TV series, who has the Midler walk and talk down perfectly. And Barry is soon a suspect as cast members of the new soap opera in which he stars begin getting killed one by one.

Campy quips abound, as do out of control pop culture and horror references. And while this is a comedy, the killer is even creepier than Michael Caine in Dressed to Kill, wearing a long coat and a creepy womans mask with long red hair. At one point, the killer even puts on a creepy cat mask!

In fact, the horror moments show that directors Mike Justice and Stephen Kitaen know a few things about the genre. They drench the whole movie in Dario Argento red lighting. They use classic eerie shots of the killer in the background. And the chase scene with a bear cub could be dropped into a serious horror movie and still work perfectly (if you take out his hilarious girly screams). Not to mention, the sets are loaded with posters of classic horror movies.

If you love pop culture, gay humor, cute guys, and low-budget b-movie horror, youll probably appreciate The Trouble with Barry.",1395187200,3,1653,4.612244897959184
5970615,1,B00F8ONHNU,absolute garbage. it gets one star for the rare amusing comment george forman was the best actor in the movie,1388016000,2,109,4.5
5970616,5,B00F8ONHNU,"Pros: Acting and writing are a LOT better than you'd expect.  It markets itself as a throwback to David DeCocteau's 80's flicks, but it's more like having one of those movies described to you by a schizophrenic homeless person.  It could be genius, or it could be grounds for involuntary commitment.  Really hard to say.
Cons:  I feel like there isn't enough blood and boobs for your average horror nut, but too much stabbing and screaming for a comedy fan.  Some jokes went over my head.  I can totally see people either loving or hating it.  It's one of those.",1386460800,3,562,4.56
5970617,5,B00F8ONHNU,"I just watched this movie last night and I gotta say I was pretty blown away.

First let's talk about the cast. A virtual who's who of aging scream queens, and a handful of actors and actresses from other infamous films... So of course I knew I was at least in for a terrible/awesome experience. I was right in a way... But so wrong at the same time.

It's pretty damn brilliant. On the exterior it is a no-budget, retro throwback with self-referential humor... Which, hell, I'm not gonna lie, but I'm usually down for because they are usually fun to laugh at. But as the film goes on it reveals its true genius. This film goes beyond silly little throwback and into an awesome blending of genres. There are elements of Giallo films (the eroticism and mystery and violence) blended with well written absurdist comedy, not to mention the afore-mentioned self-referential humor and a healthy layer of snark about the film industry (and how brutal and fickle it can be to anyone fading from the limelight). I would honestly liken the blending of genres on par with the likes of Shaun if the Dead.

I don't wanna give anything away... So I won't summarize the film for you (hate when reviews do that)... But look past the low end production values. I assure you that was done on purpose. The faux video filter was spot on (especially in one specific scene that, were it an actual VHS would be more degraded than the rest of the film due to repeated watching and rewinding and watching and rewinding, etc). I get the feeling that, as absurd as this film is, every situation (outside of the murders) stems from a real life experience... I'ma have to dig and figure that out. But seriously... Sometimes you can't make s*** like this up!

TL;DR: Pick up a copy. Watch it with an open mind. ESPECIALLY recommended for fans of Gialli or trash cinema, or fans of aging scream queens.",1385769600,5,1872,4.5625
5970618,2,B00F8ONHNU,"The Trouble with Barry has some funny moments, and some witty, well written scenes, but as a whole, it's a frantic mess.",1385683200,,120,4.5
5970619,1,B00F8ONHNU,Sound was good but for some reason the video was freezing without a continuous playing. I can not rate the movie since I could not watch it at all.,1384905600,,147,4.103448275862069
5970620,1,B00F8ONHNU,"One of the worst movies I've ever watched, I can not believe it was given good reviews. It was the biggest waste of money, it was horribly acted.",1384300800,,145,4.214285714285714
5970621,4,B00F8ONHNU,"Main reason for renting this flick (for me) was to watch Michelle Bauer, Linnea Quigley and Brinke Stevens and personally think their scenes were the funniest of the entire movie. Was smiling the whole time they were on screen. Wish they had been more in it... Anyway, the rest of the movie was fun too and personally thought Lynn Lowry and Shannon Amabile stole the scenes they were in.
I give it a 4 out 5 only because there's one random scene that drags the pace a bit, main characters are sorta very unlikable and it is more comedy than Horror (the murders were pretty much bloodless except for one).",1382400000,4,604,4.5
5970622,4,B00F8ONHNU,"'The Trouble with Barry' may be low in budget,but not in laughs. It is rather like low budget slasher films with comedic sensilbilties mixed in. It also reminds me a great deal of films that used to be viewed at Midnight by filmgoers during weekends.
  The main character (Barry) is all about himself and not many people like that. He doesn't seem to mind though. Peter Stickle's performance is worth watching. In fact, all the performances are worth the price of admission.
  This isn't 'Gone with the Wind' nor is it 'Girl's Just want to have Fun.'
  If you like goofy and cats-you should take a look at this movie!",1379894400,4,617,4.5636363636363635
5970623,3,B00F8ONHNU,"What a fun romp.  Too many indie stars to mention but it's packed full of them!  I saw Brian Nolan from ""The Lair"" and Bruce L. Hart from ""Homewrecker"" and ""Old Dogs and New Tricks"" doing a fun cameo as an arguing couple.  And my personal favorite Eric Dean from ""The men next door"".  If I have any complaints about the film it's that the editing seemed a bit choppy and the sound cuts in and out in places.  If that was intended to be retro it was misguided as all older films have terrific sound.  Otherwise a very fun and hysterically funny film.",1379894400,2,549,4.230769230769231

8613116,4,B00F8ONHNU,"The Trouble With Barry manages to play up the satirical aspect of stereotypes and clichs in the most fun, smart and devious manner. The dialogue is fast and witty throwing out more pop culture deep digs to offend pretty much every one who is or once was anyone in Hollywood. I am willing to bet that the writer and both directors cut their contacts list in half within the first stages of production of this film, if not then by now they have because these characters are obviously from personal interactions within the industry. And if they are not then that is just an injustice within itself! This film will not be for everyone, it is filled with offensive, possibly racist commentary layered with scenes of exaggerated stereotypes of not only those personalities expressed within the film but pretty much anyone that watches the film as well. However it is all in fun, with even the people involved with the film excited to poke fun at themselves and our bizarre cultural bromides.

The Trouble With Barry is a cult classic B-movie that plays up the campier side of dark satire in the gayest way, but that being said this movie is far from a ""gay only"" movie. The humor and melodrama is very relatable to Indie cult hetero community as well and if not then for gods sake get your self a gay friend or admit that you're a racist (and/or) bigot. The fact that the top cult scream queens cameo the first sequence within this movie is reason enough for all genre fans to give the movie a once over. The reason to embrace it is that it manages to be an insanely funny, intelligent and over-the-top piece of Trash/Camp cinema that proves individual expression and humor is not dead yet. The story stays mostly light with most of the edginess relying on the fact that most of the material can be quite offensive to the sensitive viewer but at the end it takes a strange sobering dark turn that reminds you that Barry is a sociopath born of a sociopath. This film somehow gets it right on all accounts with nods to every style of genre film making technique used in the past 30 years plus I think they may have given a total shout out to every musical score used from night time Trash TV to classic Hitchcock with the 80's VHS era thrown in just in case. Usually that much styling is a hot mess but The Trouble With Barry keeps it copacetic.",1433462400,,2337,4.473067915690867
8613117,5,B00F8ONHNU,"If you're looking for a movie that is just plain fun to watch then The Trouble With Barry is it! Yes it's a low budget independent film but it's got such a well written strong story, great soundtrack and a stellar main cast, cameos and classic scream queens such as Peter Stickles, Bruce L. Hart, Brian Nolan, Rena Riffel, Eric Dean, Matthew Stephen Herrick, Linnea Quigley, Brinke Stevens, Michelle Bauer, David Moretti, Michael Carbonaro, Lynn Lowry, Stephen Kitaen and Mike Justice (just off the top of my head) that you really don't notice.

8613118,5,B00F8ONHNU,"This movie is F.U.N. fun from start to end, pure joy. Witty smartass dialogue, a hot mess of a cast (including the brilliant Peter Stickles and Rena Riffel of Showgirls 2), and a whole lot of ridiculous nonsense. A Bette Midler-related subplot that I do not understand and never want to understand because it's just better that way. Flashes of inspired comic genius throughout. Oh and a kickass video for a beautiful song as a bonus. If you're looking for big budget production values just shut up and go away. If you can let that go and really appreciate a brilliant B movie made by some of the best B movie makers in the business right now, buy Barry, live Barry, love Barry.",1402444800,3,677,4.512195121951219
8613119,1,B00F8ONHNU,"The best thing that happened with this ?movie? was that there was transmitting problems which prevented me from seeing more of it.  I always demand that anything have at least one character who I can think well of.  This one failed even that minimal test.  No heros, no villains, no pleasure.  Oh well, maybe I will have better luck next time.",1402358400,,343,4.573770491803279
8613120,5,B00F8ONHNU,"I have seen a lot of low budget movies, and this one is in a class by itself.
It is one of the most original, quirky, gay-ish movies I have seen in a long time.
I say gay-ish, because it doesn't have the trappings of a lot of gay movies ( shirtless men for no reason, strained romances).
What it is NOT short on is camp and a wicked sense of humor.
There is a subplot with Bette Midler that will have you in stitches if you love Bette.  My favorite character was the Europa character.
So much of the humor and characters are not fully explained, so if a joke goes over your head, there is bound to be a reference that will have you shouting, ""Genius!!!!"" at the screen.

Yes, it's low budget ( i prefer to call these films Micro Budget ), but what it lacks in finances it makes up for in creativity.

This movie needs to be appreciated for what it is, a crazy send-up of 80's VHS movies, and for that, I applaud it, cause it delivers that.",1398816000,3,939,4.092391304347826
