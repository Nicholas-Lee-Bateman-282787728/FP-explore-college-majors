7836819,5,630304932X,"I taped this program twice while it was on tv, once for my parents and once for myself.  Somehow the last 15 minutes of the program on my mother's tape were replaced by a program on training birds in China to fish.  My copy was missing the opening 5 minutes.  And videotapes can be fragile as they age.  This is such an excellent program that I wanted to buy it on dvd and enjoy it on a wide screen television instead of my 17 inch screen Sony.  After a long wait, I found this dvd on Amazon!

Naturally it has a huge appeal to anyone who loves gardens -- or who is interested in the traditional arts and beauty of Japan.  The bonus is that watching this program carefully engenders inner calm and serenity similar to viewing these gardens in person.  Interviews with a disparate group of experts (a composer of symphonies, a stage designer, an expert in ikebana, a poet and the manager of an inn in Kyoto, as well as Buddhist monks) enhance the viewer's experience of each garden.  Equally important are the silences, when the only sounds are those occurring naturally within the garden itself.

Zen teaches that it is the process, not the goal, which is important.  Making time to watch this program in comfort, relaxed and open to its inspiration, cannot be packaged and sent by 2-day delivery.  That is up to the individual.",1440892800,,1328,4.510460251046025

7836821,5,630304932X,"I want to add my full agreement to the comments of reviewers of this wonderful film: I too have replayed many times my copy made during a PBS broadcast years ago (lucky to have had a blank tape ready at that time!). It led me to an appreciation - a shallow one, to be sure, but sincere and comforting - of Japanese sensibilities reflected in gardens, the tea ceremony, and even movies, in particular those of Ozu.",1174953600,,413,4.376623376623376
7836822,5,630304932X,"This is one of the best videos ever produced on Japanese Gardens. It is wonderfully produced, with marvelous cinematography and excellent accompanying background music. This really needs to be produced on DVD!!! It's very relaxing to watch as well as informative on design elements and the ideas behind Japanese gardens. Please produce this on DVD!",1118102400,,348,5.345454545454546
7836823,5,630304932X,"This should be rereleased on DVD. A visualy stunning voyage through the Japanese garden: Historical, Lyrical, Philisophical.
The only film I have viewed multiple times.",1041638400,,168,5.76
