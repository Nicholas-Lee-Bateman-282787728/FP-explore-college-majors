Oh, and there is also beautiful girl that everyone wants. {Corinne Calvet is delightful to watch but difficult to listen to with her high-pitched, accent-heavy voice.) The major conflict is between diamond-seeker Lancaster and corrupt cop Henreid. Lancaster is a tough-guy, near superhero in this film. Not much action in the first half of the filmtoo much talk and low-level activitybut the last half provides enough action to make the film interesting enough to watch.",1510790400,,588,5.26595744680851
