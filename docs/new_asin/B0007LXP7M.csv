8048729,4,B0007LXP7M,"For prospective buyers, be warned that this is not the Official Jess Franco Collection as previously reviewed. The Official Jess Franco Collection contains all the aforementioned titles but it is released by VIP. This set is released by Image Entertainment and contains just 4 of his films, ""Female Vampire,"" ""A Virgin among the Living Dead,"" ""The Sadistic Baron Von Klaus"" and ""Oasis of the Zombies"". As far as I know these have so far not been added to the VIP set. I haven't seen this set so I can't comment on what it looks like but Image Entertainment has a pretty good reputation in handling DVD transfers. The VIP set is available either together or separately. The VIP set is unavailable at Amazon. You can find it at Xploitedcinema.com. That set is meticulously restored to pristine condition with each film transferred in its original aspect ratio with anamorphic enhancement. Hopefully this will be the same.",1112659200,67,919,4.935483870967742
