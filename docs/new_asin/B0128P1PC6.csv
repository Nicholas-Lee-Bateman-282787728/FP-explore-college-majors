7343760,5,B0128P1PC6,I have seen many of these pictures before but seeing them in color brought them from some abstract moment in history to a sobering reality of the horror of this war and the impact on people and the nation.  I highly recommend this documentary----excellent!,1468454400,2,256,4.818181818181818
7343761,5,B0128P1PC6,"Hundreds of American Civil War photos, colorized by a select team of the top artists in the field today. The guest speakers include many respected Civil War historians - and a number of pleasant surprises. Even the live action segments are well-staged. It's obvious lot of time and effort went into this presentation. There's nothing else quite like it that I'm aware of. Blood & Glory is a ""must have"" for the Civil War enthusiast who thinks he's seen it all. It's true - at times there's sooooo much emphasis on the ""Blood"" - but, the ""Glory"" more than makes up for it. Overall, this is a very engaging documentary - my 2nd favorite, following the massive Ken Burns series. But, the real stars here are the crisp, detailed historic images. There's something about seeing 150 year-old photos in color that leaves you feeling you've ""experienced"" the 1860s.",1465689600,11,857,4.797297297297297

7343763,5,B0128P1PC6,"Brilliantly done.  Colorization has a bad name, but this one works well.  Lots of interesting history here.",1462579200,5,107,5.235294117647059

7343765,5,B0128P1PC6,"This is largely general knowledge material, so it is great for using with a classroom of students that may wonder what the Civil War looked like in color. I would recommend for folks who want a solid general overview of the Civil War.",1457913600,,234,4.465116279069767
7343766,5,B0128P1PC6,"This is an excellent capsulized version of the Civil War.  I watched it with my grand daughters and they were enthralled by the experience.  I have studied the Civil War for several years and  have seen the black and white pictures hundreds of times. However, colorizing them enhanced them more than ten fold. Further  the process used with the photographs is excellent and the skill in blending them with modern video is truly amazing.  I strongly recommend this version to anyone wanting a real-life color thumbnail of the Civil War.",1457136000,,535,4.9

8725611,3,B0128P1PC6,"The colorization of the B&W photos from the Civil War your likely familiar with does add ""life to them"" which is intent of this film. It covers the entire Civil War in 2 episodes.

This is certainly does not approach the ""gold standard"" of all documentaries done by Ken Burns, but still this show came up short for me.

The narration is fine but its some of the ""experts"" they use to explain aspects of the Civil War. Ben Stein & Richard Dreyfus are fine actors in their own way but when did they become authorities on the Civil War? Then you have Generals David Petraeus and Colin Powell who aren't really known for their expertise about the Army of the Potomac, these are respected well educated military men, but it just doesn't work for me for the Civil War.",1508544000,2,762,4.435714285714286
8725612,5,B0128P1PC6,"Very powerful colorized photos from the archives. ** Can be graphic and disturbing at times**.
Truly brings the Civil War to life.
This documentary was brilliantly done.
Very educational and most  impressive! Great narration, good content and even the reenactments can be exciting.
I'd recommend this to a friend and or any History buff. Especially fans of Civil War History .",1505088000,2,376,5.163934426229508
