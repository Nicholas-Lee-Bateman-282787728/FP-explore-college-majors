6015434,1,B00FNLUNO4,"Sorry I bought it.  Nothing but a bunch of random clips shot in 3D, and promos for 3D movies they want to sell.",1454284800,16,111,3.8260869565217392
6015435,2,B00FNLUNO4,Starts out great.  Then just gets boring.  Worth the first 30 minutes or so.  Then sit back and prepare for repetitive landscapes.  Skip it.,1453420800,30,140,4.708333333333333

6015437,4,B00FNLUNO4,"The 3-d was amazing. The cartoon at the beginning of the disc was hilarious with excellent 3-d effects. While the 3-d was outstanding on the travel, nature and underwater segments was well done, they were very repetitive.",1509235200,3,221,5.0

6015440,2,B00FNLUNO4,Seems to be earlier 3D filmlets using older technology? The 3D effect is hardly outstanding compared to newer 3D films. Content also not interesting except for the one animated story of 2 bank robbers taken down by 2 squirrels. Can't recommend it. Title sure is misleading.,1502409600,,273,4.956521739130435
6015441,3,B00FNLUNO4,not what i was looking for,1500508800,,26,3.5
6015442,4,B00FNLUNO4,"No plot here, just a variety of 3d odds & ends
Reminds me of some of the ""demo discs"" that came with the early 3d tvs.
If your just looking for visual 3d diversion, you will enjoy this. If your looking for familiar 3d shorts check out 3d rareities from 3d archives.
Personally being a 3d fan I enjoyed this
I rate it high because I love well done 3d",1499126400,3,349,4.0

6015449,5,B00FNLUNO4,"There are several negative reviews of this disc. I'm not sure what those reviewers expected or thought they were buying, but I suspect they missed the point.

With any new technology, filmmakers and photographers want to explore what's possible. The history of photography is full of explorations and discoveries -- color, motion, stereo, timie-lapse, high dynamic range, and so on. This disc is a collection of explorations of the possibilities of 3D. There's a lot of time-lapse stuff, a lot of landscapes, a lot of underwater photography, and some spectacular action as well..

If you watch this wanting a roller coaster ride, you're going to be disappointed. But if you're a true 3D fan, if you're a photographer, if you're interested in what ambitious videographers are attempting, there's a lot here to appreciate just for the sheer joy of seeing what the technology is capable of.

3D is a more difficult technology than most people realize. It's not just about getting two side-by-side images. There are issues of convergence, where to place the window, what spacing the cameras should have, the angle of the lenses, the lighting, the exposure times, and more. Add time-lapse or underwater photography and the problems are multiplied. (David Attenborough did a marvelous set for Sky TV called Kingdom Of Plants 3D. The ""making of"" featurette is fascinating and the set is highly recommended for both the visuals and for the behind the scenes bonus.)

As someone who has  been a fan of the 3D process since the early fifties, I can say that this is a worthwhile purchase for people who love 3D. Much of the time-lapse landscape photography is stunning. On a well-tuned system, it's sheer beauty.

There's no story here, there's no point to be made, there's just a lot of excellent 3D photography, and that's the point of this disc -- to show you the best of what's possible in 3D animation and photography.",1482019200,125,1913,4.925465838509317
6015450,4,B00FNLUNO4,looked great on my 4k,1480896000,2,21,3.4
6015451,4,B00FNLUNO4,"Some very interesting images.  I was curious about the second segment that seemed to be visual content from a video game.
Difficult to tell, but very interesting over-all !!!",1478476800,3,174,5.0

6015453,2,B00FNLUNO4,Thought this was going to be amazing - honestly it's just ok - nothing you can't see elsewhere.  Unimpressed.,1463443200,8,109,4.7368421052631575
6015454,5,B00FNLUNO4,ok,1462665600,3,2,2.0
6015455,4,B00FNLUNO4,This is an excellent DVD of 3D. Really pops right out at you. I Only gave it four stars as the last part of the video is basically a lot of different short episodes of a surfing school. The 3D is ok but unless your a surfer looking to learn more it gets tedious after a while. The rest is fun and informative.,1462147200,28,309,3.9206349206349205
6015456,5,B00FNLUNO4,If you own a 3D TV... then you'll want this.,1460937600,13,44,3.5

8617157,5,B00FNLUNO4,Fast delivery.  And was really impressed with the quality of the short 3d clips that made the make up of the movie ... if you are a fan of 3d visuals ? A MUST HAVE ! Just know that there isn't a storyline/plot to this amazing eye candy . Its pretty long i think too,1530489600,,265,3.8181818181818183

8617160,3,B00FNLUNO4,"This is certainly not the best 3D footage available, it's the best available to the studio. Had they been able to include scenes from AVATAR, GRAVITY, SAN ANDREAS and others, then they could truly call it ""best.""",1526083200,,212,4.756756756756757

8617162,4,B00FNLUNO4,Watched with Optoma 3D projector and the mostly natural 3D was great if you are an avid 3D fan. .  But the subjects are not story lines and might be boring for some.  The seller is service oriented and I would give them 5 Stars.,1517270400,2,228,4.044444444444444
8617163,2,B00FNLUNO4,Very mediocre.,1514678400,,14,6.5
8617164,1,B00FNLUNO4,"I saw a trailer for this on YouTube which included some great footage of skydivers doing RW.  The only skydiving I can find on the disc is guys flying down a mountain in wingsuits.  Pretty exciting, but not what I bought the disc for.  The menus were just icons (no descriptive text) so there was no way of knowing what you were choosing to watch.  But I'm pretty sure I clicked on every possible choice and never found it.  Very disappointed.",1511308800,2,443,4.419753086419753
8617165,1,B00FNLUNO4,3D feature on the disc did not work with our Vizio 3D TV and Samsung 3D Blu-ray player  although other 3D discs do.  Will be attempting to return for full purchase price refund. ,1509840000,3,178,4.333333333333333
