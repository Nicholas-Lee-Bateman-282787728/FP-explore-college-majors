5076969,4,B007C8RZRO,"Here we have represented a varied collection of 50s film genres. It's got something for everyone. Most of them are pretty good and deserve a wider audience. For the price and the quality of films this set is well worth purchasing.

  Since someone has already done us the service of listing all the movies in the collection I'm just going to direct your attention to a few titles you maybe not have heard of before. No matter your tastes I'm sure you or someone you're buying this for will find something to like.

The Admiral was a Lady: This is a most excellent screwball comedy. A WAV nicked named The Admiral is trying to get her life back together after returning from WW2. She runs into a group of ex-GI pals, loveable loser types, who work very hard at not working, preferring instead to delay responsibility and just goof off alot. There are a couple of sub plots but the movie is mostly about the witty interaction between the 4 pals and The Admiral.

Battles of Chief Pontiac: This is the story of a soldier/scout trying to mediate peace between English Colonials and the Ottawa tribe during American Colonial times. Its low budget but the action and acting are pretty good. It also shows a fairly even handed look at native American/English Colonial relationships. Plus you get to see Lon Chaney Jr. as Pontiac, chief of the Ottawa. That alone makes it worth a look.

Captain Scarface: This no frills mix of action and (mostly) intrigue is short but sweet. It involves a mysterious ship, exotic beautiful women, an evil mastermind (gee would that be the aforementioned Captain Scarface?) and a hero from the feet-of-clay Bogart school.

The Conquest of Everest: Here's an amazing documentary. It captures the trials and tribulations of the first known ascent of Mt. Everest. The view of and from Everest is amazing and seeing the astonishing hardships these explorers endured will drop your jaw. If there were more documentaries like this we probably wouldn't need action movies. (Except for Steven Seagal films of course)

The Hoodlum: A lean and mean straight up crime story about a real nasty dude who betrays his family's trust to hold up and armored car. Lawrence Tierney is one of the meanest S.O.B.s on film in this one. This film hits you like a punch in the gut.

Life and Loves of Mozart: This is a light hearted romanticized version of the life of Mozart. It's pretty much the opposite of Amadeus. It's mostly fluff but it looks and sounds good.

Martin Luther: An excellent telling of the life of the 16th century religious figure. Acting, directing, sets, everything is outstanding. The only drawback is that the reproduction is not the best. However the print is so old we're lucky to still have it.

The Night America Trembled: This is an episode of a TV show called Studio One. This episode is basically a reenactment of Orson Welles broadcast of War of the Worlds. It covers the studio end and some audience reactions. It's interesting and pretty well done. It also features many up and coming young actors.

St. Benny the Dip: A British comedy reminiscent of ""We're No Angels"". A trio of British convicts pose as ministers in order to pull off a heist. However once they start helping people, they find it's a hard habit to break.

Three Husbands: When a deceased ladies man ascends into Heaven he finds that one free wish is part of the welcome package. His wish is to observe the reactions of his 3 poker buddies to a sealed letter he left for each of them, a letter that describes his affairs with their wives. It's a comedy and a decent one at that. With Eve Arden in the mix some witty rejoinders are thrown around and the smaller bit parts are staffed by some solid character actors.",1357171200,143,3718,4.658015267175572

5076987,3,B007C8RZRO,"It's a lot of material for the price, but I am somewhat disappointed with the actual content / titles included in this set. I am certainly not expecting award winning films, just a better distribution over the decade and some better choices to include in this set. Oddly, to me this set has pretty much the same feel as the 40's pack. I agree with another reviewer - too many movies dated early in the decade, with very few  from the middle to later years.  This is the first set where I skipped over several movies after previewing them. But for the price,and the number of discs it's hard to fuss too much. I have all the Decade packs from the 80's to the 40's. Of all these, this is my least favorite.",1472428800,2,704,4.285714285714286

Having; ""A Tale of Two Cities"", ""Cyrano DeBergerac"", ""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"", "" The Lady Says No"", ""The Last Time I Saw Paris"". "" The Jackie Robinson Story"". and ""Chained For Life"", make it that much more desirable. Nice collection of not quite stellar 50s movies of many genres.

Hey! This is before they had dolby, hi-fi and all that! I assume most of the negative reviews come from younger folks who were raised on HD TV! I haven't had any problem listening or watching any of these movies! Sure there are a few places where there might have been a film splice, or the sound may be less than 2015 standards, but it's nothing that's really going to bother anyone except for the spoiled younger generation!
