2486008,5,B000E3L7FA,"I absolutely adored this show and was so disappointed when it was cancelled. I actually have all the shows on VHS but I am looking forward to replacing those worn out tapes with these DVDs.

Thank you many times over for finally releasing this series. Hopefully the remaining seasons won't be far behind.",1137542400,7,304,4.735849056603773
2486009,5,B000E3L7FA,"I have been waiting for this is come out on DVD forever.  The characters are well developed, the stories thoughtful and interesting, and when you start watching, you can't stop.  I've been hooked since the very first show, so many years ago.  I used to have ALL the episodes on VHS, but somehow I lost them, and I was crushed.  So, like many people out there I will be ordering this, and all the other seasons as soon as they are released.

If you like westerns, family dramas, or just a GREAT ensemble cast, this is for you.  And unlike many shows that just end, and leave you hanging with a cliffhanger or unresolved storylines, The Young Riders writers knew that it was being cancelled, and did the fans a great justice by ending the 3rd season by completely wrapping up all the stories.  I can't wait for March 21st.",1136851200,9,820,4.426666666666667
2486010,5,B000E3L7FA,"This is such great news! The Young Riders is a fantastic show, with the thrills and excitement of the Old West, and a little history thrown in. Gregg Rainwater played my absolute favorite character on the show, but truly the best episodes were the ensemble ones, where each character contributed.

OK, hard to wait until March 21 . . .",1136851200,14,335,4.583333333333333
2486011,5,B000E3L7FA,"I had given up all hope of ever seeing my favourite show out on DVD, so this news has made my year - heck my decade - and I've already pre-ordered it. I just cannot wait to ditch my flickering, worn out old video tapes and replace them with some quality recordings.

Sony, if you're listening, hurry up with S2 and 3! I'll be first in the queue to buy!

I hear this is one of the most requested TV to DVD shows out there. And no wonder. It's a beautifully crafted western with engaging characters, gorgeous scenery, sparkling dialogue and scripts, and most of all...heart. This show has a lot of heart.

I was on the edge of my seat every week, sharing the adventures of the Pony Express riders. Moving, funny and even shippy at times, this was just great entertainment with characters you cared about.

Buy it now! You won't be disappointed.",1136851200,22,842,4.412903225806452
2486012,5,B000E3L7FA,"Fans of ""The Young Riders"" rejoice!  This is something that we have been hoping would happen for so long.  I have been a fan of TYR since it first aired on ABC in 1989 and I've remained a loyal fan through my taped episodes.  My worries about the tapes being too old and falling apart can now be put to rest because of the DVD release!

If you've never seen ""The Young Riders"", trust me when I say that it's a great show.  It follows the lives of Pony Express riders.  It's got action, adventure, romance -- everything you need for a great television show!  (Plus who can resist a show that features gorgeous men like Gregg Rainwater (my fave!), Josh Brolin, Stephen Baldwin, Ty Miller?)

I am pre-ordering this right now!  Big thanks to whomever's decision this was -- you made a LOT of fans very happy!",1136851200,11,804,4.378378378378378
2486013,5,B000E3L7FA,"I've waited for this show to be released on vhs/dvd since the first episode!!!! The cast of characters and the cast of actors and actresses is supurb. This show appeals to all ages and genders. For anybody that was too young in 1989 to have watched this show now is the time.

Anthony Zerbe as Teaspoon is the best. Not to be missed are Ty Miller, Stephen Baldwin, Josh Brolin and Yvonne Suhor. Also look for special guests like Cynthia Nixon,Della Reese, David Carradine, Pernell Roberts, Jamie Lynn Bauer, Richard Roundtree, Brian Bonsall and my favorite Bart the Bear.

In a nutshell the show is about the Pony Express and all its trials and tribulations leading up to the Cival War. However with such a large cast the show also deals with all its members lives as well such as Wild Bill, The Kid and Lou (a girl in disguise as a boy to become a member of the Pony Express.)

You'll find gunfights, sasparilla drinking, horses, beautiful country and even romance (yes there is some of that).

Trust me buy it!!!",1136851200,56,1014,4.554945054945055

2486018,3,B000E3L7FA,The series is actually pretty good however at least 4 of the episodes won't play- it seems there are scratches on the discs. It's more like Season 1 minus the episodes you can't watch because the discs aren't in great condition. Most of them will play but there are sections where it will skip or freeze up before it will continue with playing the disc.,1460937600,,353,4.446153846153846

It's not as good as I remember it, but still ok and brings back memories.  However at least one episode on each disk played 1/2 way thru before freezing and not playing.  The disks were poorly packed inside the case and I'm not sure if it was scratched in transit, but that was very disappointing.",1439251200,,428,4.3125

2486055,5,B000E3L7FA,"I still enjoy this show even if it is a little cheesy. It's not Walker Texas Ranger goofy but it's very ""expected."" It is a western so there is shooting but nothing so violent that I can't share it with my niece and nephew (9-7 years). Because it's a western, you can't tell that it's over 20 years old. The only problem with the box set is some episodes are missing. I believe it's due to licensing issues. If you aren't familiar with the show, it makes for choppy plot lines going from Season 1 to 2. I also noticed the order of the episodes played in a different order from what was listed on the box. Seems like they had an amateur proof these. But otherwise it's a solid set. I purchased Seasons 1-3 and I'm very happy with all. Kind of wish the show ran longer.

As a side note, the characters based on historical figures has inspired my young nephew to read more books on Wild Bill, William F. Cody, the Pony Express and life in the west. Can't complain about a show that inspires reading and education!",1410393600,,1010,4.287958115183246

It may be a little repetitive and not entirely historically accurate, but that's fiction & this show was entertaining!

2486086,3,B000E3L7FA,"This review is for one particular product, NOT the Young Riders series itself (which I love).  Unfortunately, the Best of Season 1 DVD set is missing the audio track for ""Black Ulysses""--instead, the track for ""False Colors"" is put with the episode.  Which wouldn't be so bad if these discs were subtitled/captioned (then you could mute the audio and read the captions)... but they're not.  The other seven episodes are fine (the ""False Colors"" video DOES have its own audio), and I enjoy having them for a low price, but I'm disappointed in what is clearly a production error.  I won't purchase any other DVDs from this maker.

(There's also a strange cut in one episode, but because that may not be the DVD maker's fault, I'm ignoring it.)

And Amazon... will you PLEASE stop lumping reviews together for different products?!?  Each product review should be for the exact one listed.  So here are the episodes included in this 2-disc set:

Pilot (The Kid)
Gunfighter
Home of the Brave
Speak No Evil

Bad Blood
(Black Ulysses, no audio)
Ten-Cent Hero
False Colors

(no extras, no captions)

Hope this review helps someone... in return for so many other folks' reviews helping me with other products.

If you're unfamiliar with the series you can read about it on IMDB or somewhere else.  We love the show.  For a fun, funny, and imaginative Western you just can't go wrong; and you get to see an amusingly young Stephen Baldwin and James Brolin as young Buffalo Bill Cody and Wild Bill Hickock!

2486106,4,B000E3L7FA,"This show was very popular with an extremely loyal fan base while airing.  It was once rated the most highly anticipated DVD release of any TV show.  There was a delay with the release of season two over distribution rights, but luckily that has been resolved and we have all three seasons now.

THE STORY: Set just before the American Civil War, this series presented a highly fictionalized account of the heyday of the Pony Express. Its focus was a group of young Express riders based at the waystation in Sweetwater, Kansas. Running the station was ex-Texas Ranger and all-around eccentric Teaspoon Hunter. The role of cook, housekeeper and mother hen was filled first by Emma and later by Rachel. The riders included the future ""Buffalo Bill"" Cody and James Butler (""Wild Bill"") Hickok, as well as Ike, a mute, Buck, a half-White/half-Kiowa scout and the Kid, a quiet Southerner. Their final member was Lou, a young woman who lived and worked with the riders disguised as a boy. In second season, their group was joined by Noah Dixon.

PACKAGING: The set includes five discs in two regular sized DVD cases and housed in a sort of collector's box snugly fitting the two standard DVD cases.",1359244800,19,1192,4.771844660194175

2486110,5,B000E3L7FA,"Please release the rest of the seasons as soon as possible!!!!!!!!!!!! We enjoy each of the characters so much - CODY - KID - EMMA - TEASPOON - JIMMY - BUCK - IKE - LOUISE AND SAM - BUT I'd have everyone listed first if that could be. It is a joy to watch them ride - such expert horsemen and horsewomen. Also, their emotions are front and center along with their intelligence especially displayed in the difficulties they find themselves in. Plus, they genuinely care about each other and about those who come into their lives as time goes on. WE love Louise and her determination and gentleness, Cody and his rifle and his great humor, Kid and his forward thinking, Emma and her genuineness, Teaspoon and his wisdom of his years, Jimmy and his upfront heart, Buck and his tender care of Ike, Ike and his absolute refusal to let his not being able to speak hold him back from life, and Sam and his faithfulness, Katey, and all of the other characters who play their parts so well. Such an excellent series. Thanks!!! I left this same review on season two and three - hoping for them to be released ASAP!!",1337299200,,1105,4.421568627450981
2486111,5,B000E3L7FA,"I have the season 1 set and love it to death - I know I'll have to order a second copy, as I'll wear out this one soon.

I was getting my season two and three fix in Hulu, but the commercials are getting way too annoying. It's not available for streaming at all on Netflix anymore. I learned that after I signed up for Netflix, 90% of why I signed up was only for the TYR episodes.

I've written to MGM, as Fox no longer handles their distribution for video content and MGM isn't releasing anything new, (may be why TYR got pulled form Netflix, I don't know. :P)

Has anyone tried DVDCheckout.com, which advertises on Amazon? They advertise offering TYR ""the Complete Series"" for $79. But is this even a real company, or a scam? Any help on ratings or reviews of DVDCheckout.com service and legitimacy woudl be appreciated.",1333411200,,823,4.437086092715232

Unfortunatly, I watched them repeatedly growing up, that I doubt the tapes don't work anymore. So you can imagine how happy I was when I recieved Season 1 for my birthday! Nothing better than watching these ""hot"" young riders and their adventures. It is a very family friendly show, and I cant wait to show it to my children. and I am sure they will love it just as much as I do!

2486126,5,B000E3L7FA,"I was raised, as were many of the Baby Boomers in Oz, on American westerns. First TV program I saw on our family's new b/w Pye 17 inch ( saw the Mickey Mouse Club show on the only then TV in the street a year earlier) was Hopalong Cassidy. Then came Roy Rogers, Wagon Train, Wyatt Earp, Bat Masterson, Wagon Train, Rawride, Annie Oakley, Buffalo Bill Jnr, Cheyanne, Sugarfoot, Bronco, Wild Wild West, Have Gun will Travel, Maverick, The Virginian etc etc etc...could we add Zorro in that mix.

Consequently American western icons are imbedded in my psyche, even though we had a few notorious characters in the Oz past such as Ned Kelly.

Only natural that as one grows older that you want to return to the magic of those simpler times and renew contact with those western icons. To have the opportunity to learn more of their past, even if fictionalised, is somehow increasing the fun.

Young Riders touches on those childhood memories offering a 'makings of' some of those iconic characters (who were no doubt only the creation of the penny publications that established the legends). Watching a young 'Buffalo Bill' Cody and 'Wild Bill' Hickok and in a later season 'Billy the Kid' is like meeting old school boy chums after years of absence and for me at least I found the series at least the match of many of those early great westerns. The other characters esp Zerbe fill in a wonderful olde world western feel of high adventure, cattle rustling, gun fighting, Cowboys and Indians drama...and romance

The old saying that'they don't make them like they used to' doesnt hold here, because in this instance, they do. I'm now craving, like most enthusiasts for seasons 2 and 3 to remind me more of my childhood bliss.",1314403200,2,1719,4.682119205298013

Hopefully the other seasons will be released soon.  Great action and interesting story lines make this show different from the garbage that is around today.  The characters are very easy to like and attach to, and the scenery in the show is awesome.  Highly recommend.",1312156800,,407,4.445945945945946
2486128,5,B000E3L7FA,"This was one of my favorite shows growing up. I am absolutely thrilled to have found it on DVD, and cant wait for the other two seasons to be released. The show is about a group of young riders for the pony express, who all have different stories and talents that they bring in. You have the ex-Texas Ranger Teaspoon Hunter, played by Anthony Zerbe as the station master who trains the young boys. Melissa Leo plays the sweet housemother Emma. Josh Brolin is Jimmy ""Wild Bill"" Hiccock, who is quick temper and even quicker with a gun. Stephen Baldwin plays William F. Cody, aka Buffalo bill, who is good at hitting targets at a great distance. while i've never been a big fan of his, he did play the role well. Ty Miller is the Kid, who is kinda naive and way to perfect, he doesnt really have any special skills but is willing to work hard. Yvone suher plays Lou, a girl in disguise, she can hold her own with the best of them when it comes to riding. Its not long before the boys find out that Lou is in fact Louise. Then come my personal favorite characters. Ike McSwain played by Travis Fine is a bald mute. His family was killed when he was very young and he witnessed the whole thing, the trama caused him to lose his voice, the baldness was from a childhood illness. Ike is extremely gifted with animals and can tame just about any of them. His best friend and my Favorite out of all of them is Running Buck Cross, a half-white half-Kiowa played by Gregg Rainwater. Buck as he prefers is an expert tracker, rider, interupter and is excellent with the knife he wears strap to his boot. Personally I don't think they make shows like this anymore, I only wish that it had lasted more than 3 seasons. You can watch all three seasons on Netflix streaming. I rewatched them recently and fell in love with the show all over again. Even my 2 year old son and 4 year old daughter enjoy it. Of course they like watching it for the horses I think, but I think almost any age or gender will enjoy this series.",1311984000,,2004,4.2902374670184695

2486131,5,B000E3L7FA,"I was so excited when I saw this dvd was available. I used to watch this show all the time but then it went off the air. So what if it's not historically accurate...it's an entertaining show that you cant help being nostalgic for. I only wish they would hurry up and release seasons 2 and 3 because it's just not complete without them.

If you have never seen it, The Young Riders is a western from back in the late 80's early 90's featuring six young pony express riders. The story illustrates all the trials they face as well as how they grow closer and closer into becoming a real family. It's a feel good story with some lovable characters and even if you aren't into westerns (which typically I am not) this is a really enjoyable show!",1296086400,,740,4.323741007194244
2486132,2,B000E3L7FA,"This season was overacted, melodramatically written with too convenient plot devices, and is very predictable.  Like most western series the protagonists go through a weekly series of outlandish situations where they must risk life and limb, but overcome odds that would be insurmountable to average people.  Most of the stories were just variations on tired old situations that have been done to death in older series.

We are supposed to believe that these kids are pony express riders in Wyoming, but the scenes in all the episodes, except the pilot, are filmed in Arizona.  Arizona landscape and vegetation are significantly different from Wyoming.

I still give it two stars for nostalgic reasons, having enjoyed to campy pleasures of watching this series when it was on TV.",1290988800,2,779,5.150793650793651

I'm sure if you have ever watched this show you can relate to that. If you have never watched this show you have to try it. My husband thought it was going to be a stupid, cheesey, low budget show.

The lack of bad language and blood was a breath of fresh air. I understand that the bad guy died when he was shot without having to see his insides all over the road.

The Pony Express didn't last long, but it was a great service to America.  I also like the fact that it also puts the points of views of who sided with which side of the Civil War.

The only thing that I saw wrong with this is the setting.  The show takes place in the Nebraska territory, but there are cacti that live only in Arizona and surrounding area.  That's the only thing that I saw wrong for location.",1214092800,,571,4.0
2486164,4,B000E3L7FA,"When ""The Young Riders"" aired, I was only able to view a few episodes, but enjoyed what I saw.  Hence, when I found the show listed on Amazon I purchased it, and have just finished watching Season 1.  For the most part, I completely enjoyed the episodes, despite the fact that I had to keep reminding myself: ""This is a fictional show, so ignore the historical non-sense and just get into a good, old fashioned western.""  And let me tell you, as someone who has read about and studied the ""old west"" for over 40 years, it is not always easy to ignore the ""historical farces.""  But I did, and it is well worth it.  Moreover, I hope that in doing so, people might find something in my review, unlike some current reviews, to help them decide to watch the show.  And, like most other reviewers, I sure hope the studios release the other seasons.

For a show with such a large cast and such a limited venue, ""The Young Riders"" does an outstanding job--each actor getting their moment in the ""light"" to flesh out their character.  In fact, it is the characters/actors that make this show SO fun to watch!  Not being a huge follower of actors, I have no idea if any of the stars have managed to go on to ""bigger"" things, or have had a very successful career, but what they contributed to the ""The Young Riders"" is truly noteworthy--especially given the scripts sometimes ""too unrealistic"" content.  In particular, I think that Anthony Zerbe, as Aloysius ""Teaspoon"" Hunter (a former Texas Ranger and one of the only survivors of the Battle of the Alamo), gives the best performances I have ever seen by him.  While Ty Miller (as The Kid), Stephen Baldwin (as William F. Cody), Josh Brolin (as James Butler Hickok), and Travis Fine (as Ike McSwain) all give great performance (despite the fact they are all clearly too big--a rider could not weigh over 125 pounds), it is the other performances that I truly enjoyed.

Melissa Leo as Emma Shannon, the caretaker of the station and the riders, is adorable, alway on the money, and her portrayal expands exceptionally well through the season as her character grows.  Brett Cullen is both comical and dramatic as Sam Cain, the current marshal of Sweetwater, and a former gunslinger who is in love with Emma.  In many ways Cullen and his character are the central figures of the show.  Yvonne Suhor, who plays the intriguing character Louise ""Lou"" McCloud (who presents herself as a man so that she can join the riders, but is found out by The Kid in the first episode, and by the other riders when they help her rescue her brother and sister from their abusive outlaw father), I find to be extremely refreshing, adding an unexpected dimension to the show.  However, in my opinion, the best performer on the show is Gregg Rainwater (a Native American actor of Osage, Cherokee, and Irish descent) who plays Buck Cross (Running Buck), a half Kiowa who is close friends with Ike.  More importantly, Rainwater's character, Buck, helps to break down stereotypes that the townsfolk have of Indians and, I fell, is the person that is always there and the glue that holds the ""gang"" together.  Gregg Rainwater is the greatest redemption towards the ""political indelicacy"" of ""The Young Riders.""

Less simple for me to accept about the ""The Young Riders"" is what I am trying to minimize, by saying the show is ""politically indelicate.""  I say this because there are a number of scenes and episodes involving Native Americans that are troubling: costumes, characterization, themes, tribes involved, or socio-cultural ways of Native American life.  Conversely, there are also scenes that are quite positive in the presentation of Native Americans.  Similarly, I found myself very unenthusiastic about the way ""The Young Riders"" addressed the politics of the causes of the American Civil War.  The portrayal of persons sympathetic to the Southern cause are almost unilaterally the ""bad guys,"" and supportive or activists of slavery.  Yet at the same time, the show does show the US soldiers declaring martial law, trampling on private citizens, ignoring the US Constitution, and, in general, questionable individuals.  I just wish the show had left the whole subject alone--especially since ""The Young Riders"" takes place (apparently) in Wyoming, where the American Civil War had little, if any, import during this time period.  While there are other political issues I saw in the show, all were generally dealt with in the same fashion; that is, the show ""attempted"" to counter weight political views that were portrayed.

Overall, I would love to give ""The Young Riders"" five stars--and would based simply on pure entertainment--but I feel it necessary to acknowledge the ""political"" contradictions of the show.  The four star rating is also based in part on aspects I have yet to mention: the ludicrousness of the number of people ""killed,"" how easy some are ""killed"" and how easy some ""recover,"" how seldom anyone actually reloads, and--perhaps most pertinent to the overall theme of the show--how little the pony express riders actually ""ride.""

I hesitate from giving it 5 stars due to the quality of the production.  Some scenes look like old Bonanza footage that have not been ""touched up"" to DVD quality.  I'm guessing that some of the original footage was damaged and unable to be polished, but that is just an assumption.  However, they last only a few seconds and occur sporatically.

And I wish that outtakes, subtitles, and bonus features had been offered.  But who knew then that the now adult fans would be wanting to watch the series again and again.  I do like looking at the boys on the dvd faces though--so the packaging is acceptable.

Overall, it's a wonderful ride down memory lane.  And I can only smile when I hear the opening music.  I look forward to the release of the next 2 seasons, though the first was my favorite.",1207872000,,1013,4.306878306878307

I ordered my copy and have watched a few of the episodes, bringing back lots of memories. I remember The Young Riders as being pretty good as a western, and about as historically accurate as any of them, (it'll be fun to watch for the few errors I can spot)- the show was very innovative with some of the plot twists and story details the producers came up with.

In terms of picture /sound quality so far I've watched the pilot (filmed in a completely different location to the rest of the series- looked much more like 1860 Kansas would have) and two other episodes. #1 ""The Kid"" introduces everyone, very detailed- good story, my only complaint is that the closing scene of Kid riding off into the sunset is way too dark (you can't see him) and the closing credits are much too hard to read. #15 ""Lady for a night"" was the second episode I watched, everything good about it. Yvonne Suhor never looked very much like a boy but she did look very nice in a dress in this one (Emma intoduced ""Louise"" to the boys in this episode). The story is good, the picture and sound good and the closing credits are much improved over the pilot.

#16 ""Unfinished Business"" another good story in which Emma's husband returns to town after betraying a wagon train to robbers. Good action and story here, like so many in the series. Good color and sound too.

It was really pretty funny. Watching it has brought back so many memories.  I love the whole cast they compliment each other nicely.  It was a great show and sadly short lived.

2486255,4,B000E3L7FA,"an enjoyable series that i can watch with my kids.  my 5 year old likes all the horses.  i never watched the series when it was on tv until about 1/2 way through the 2nd season for want of something to watch.  i was pleasantly surprised at how they encorporated a lot of the historical legends into the show. by purchasing the 1st season i found that i had missed the version of how wild bill got his ""reputation"" and could now view that. i am basically historically handicapped so not knowing any of the true historical facts of certain real characters, i don't know how if at all accurate any or portions of it could be.  but if you're looking for some light entertainment this series is great.  i especially like how the characters don't always choose the proper thing to do and the consequential fallout.  hopefully my ten year old is paying attention. the cast is very diverse and the series definitely gives each of them a juicy story that deals with slavery, prejudice against indians in that time, women in a man's world, a character who is mute and a lot of great deal of rivalry and also support amoungst the group.  teaspoon, the ""boss"" of the group always is doing some new get well scheme and i think provides the group with boundaries and a parental ear, but at the same time is someone you can shake your head and chuckle at like a wacky kid. this series gets a 4 star from me because -surprise- a series that only went 3 seasons, but actually has an ending with closure for the characters!",1167868800,2,1505,4.411552346570397

2486258,5,B000E3L7FA,"It took me a couple of episodes to warm up to ""The Young Riders"", having become used to grittier Westerns like ""Deadwood"".  This is definitely not ""Deadwood"" - it's good, clean fun and, though every episode gets pretty tense, you can always count on it all working out by the end.  I find this really refreshing, actually. Sometimes the villains are walking stereotypes and the plot twists are pretty predictable.  However, the cast is all-around top-notch and the character development is excellent.  I have particularly enjoyed Josh Brolin as Jimmy Hickok and Melissa Leo as Emma Shannon, though the entire cast is really fantastic and they all work well together.

I remember hiding behind the couch and sneaking to watch it.  Now I can watch it any time I want and I love it!

The only minor gripe is that there were no extras, but given how long ago the series was made (it pre-dates DVD), I suspect there weren't any for them to add.",1154217600,7,530,3.8796296296296298

I can't say how thrilled I was to pop in the first disc and to hear the opening music - it was like being transported back in time when I would wait excitedly in front of the TV for a new episode to start.

At first I was worried that years on I would find the show cheesy, but it's not at all - it stands the test of time and leaves me with that happy feeling I had the first time I watched it.

I bought this DVD set because I had been a fan of the show when it was originally on tv and wanted to add this to my collection.

The way it has been re-mastered and re-worked is great! The color and sound is more crisp and it's nicely organized set up makes it easy to go right where you want. On the reverse side of the DVD, there are summaries of every episode which is a huge plus!

The only thing I did not like was that there weren't any extras included; I mean who's to say there were any to begin with, but nonetheless.

I hope they release the remaining 2 seasons in a DVD set - I will certainly buy them!

2486275,5,B000E3L7FA,"We just finished watching the complete 1st season of The Young Riders on DVD. The complete season was over before we knew it. It's a great show, great characters portrayed by great actors (several that are now marquee actors) and story lines full of action. It stretches the envelop by including such commonly known historic figures within our group of Pony Express mail carrying Young Riders as Wild Bill Hickock (Josh Brolin) and Buffalo Bill Cody (Stephen Baldwin). Likewise we have an ex-Texas Ranger (Anthony Zerbe creates an amazing character) with connections to the Alamo, The Kid from Virginia,(Ty Miller & yes Civil War connections), who handles a gun as well as Wild Bill, the Sweetwater sheriff, with a gun slinging past, and even more characters that open up story lines connected to Indians (Gregg Rainwater), frontier women, (yes one of the Young Riders is a female in disguise), and those who cannot speak. This is before we get to an impressive list of Guest Stars. In other words the Young Riders offers everything one could want in an old-fashioned Western. It also adds platforms for more contemporary views and social concerns and does a superior job of it! So relax and ignore the impossibility of all these people and events intersecting in Sweetwater and enjoy. Do we ever find out who is the fastest draw? Is it Wild Bill, the Kid, the Sheriff or the ex-Texas Ranger or another of our team? We already know some of the bad guys that were not fast enough.

There are no extras, and occasionally some shots appear grainy, but overall I believe that it is great value for 25 fantastic episodes.

The dvds work perfectly with my Australian tv (cheap PAL TV which happens to have NTSC capability), and shipping out to Australia was quite fast. Tough packaging meant my dvds and the box they're in arrived in mint condition.

I would recommend The Young Riders to any one who loves quality westerns. There is great character development, and a lot of moral quandries for you to think about. The Young Riders is a lot less corny than Dr Quinn Medicine Woman, and has a far wider scope.

This first season was in my opinion the best, as later seasons reflected frequent behind-the-scenes tinkering with the format, the most unfortunate being the jettisoning of the character Emma (Melissa Leo), perhaps the best actor and definitely the most historically credible looking character, in exchange for a ""sexier"" female figure to presumably attract more male viewers.

With that said, I was really disappointed mainly with the fact that, while the footage that has been digitally enhanced is GORGEOUS, there is footage mixed in that has not been enhanced and the contrast is extremely obvious. I know nothing about film restoration so I don't know if this corner was cut due to finances or actual problems with the film itself. Also, there are a lack of extras that could have been included. The series did include two young actors that would go on to become ""movie stars"" (Josh Brolin and Stephen Baldwin) however, they couldn't include anything other than the episodes? Not even ""backstage"" photos or even a small snipet on their Emmy wins? The box itself seemed pretty plain and really gave the feel that no true effort was put into the releasing of the series outside of the digital enhancement.

2486320,5,B000E3L7FA,I think they only ever showed Season 1 here in the UK but it was enough for me to fall in love with this show.  I've since managed to see all 3 seasons on video thanks to friends in the USA.  I can't wait for the season 1 dvd.  Just hope they hurry and release the other 2 seasons.,1142899200,3,281,3.7288135593220337
2486321,5,B000E3L7FA,"""The Young Riders"" was my all-time favorite TV program, and I've been checking periodically ever since series started coming out on DVD to see if it was one to be released.  Right now my heart is beating a mile a minute, I am just absolutely ecstatic to finally be able to order it!  I too have every episode on VHS--several times--but DVD will be so much better (and take up a lot less space!)!!  Thank you, and hurry with the other two seasons!",1142380800,2,446,4.349397590361446

2486333,4,B000E3L7FA,"I'm always glad to see my favorite shows arriving on DVD, especially since my tapes were in a flood & don't work the best anymore.  This western was well done -- a little unbelievable & over the top at times, but hey, it's not like the billed it as a historical documentary.  My big disappointment with TV to DVD is the lack of ""extras"".  For (commonly) $60+ for a season, there should be, at the very least, a couple commentaries & a blooper reel.  Someone somewhere must keep video of behind the scenes stuff that could be added to a DVD!",1142121600,5,540,4.316831683168317

It has always been a favorite of mine.  I miss it. But at least now I will have the opportunity to watch it any time I want. One of the best western series ever to air.
