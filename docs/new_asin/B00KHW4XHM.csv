8659091,5,B00KHW4XHM,"Buy this and Studio One. These are the top two live drama programs from the 1950s. It's true, these are some of TVs best moments. TV from 1965 and beyond was crap compared to the early days. The writing, the acting, the genius it took to direct and even run a camera on these live programs took a great deal of sill. No more truly live TV! Sad. Don't say SNL! They are doing skit comedy. An actor might be in the show for 5 mins. They use cue cards. There is a format. These shows were different each week. Different writers, actors, directors, stories. well written tv? Here it is.
These DVDs and the booklet are great, well done. The films are the best source material that they could find: 16MM prints of the kinescopes. No video tape in the early and mid 50's, and the video system that they used after that was scrapped for a different video tape system.
Real acting here! Great writing! This was back in the day when TV was mostly done in New York. These are New York's best actors during that period!
I believe that you will make certain that you'll keep these in your DVD collection. You will probably ask your close friends if they have ever seen these and if not, you'll invite them over to see TV at it's best.",1506816000,2,1221,4.29004329004329

This set includes a prime selection of episodes from the age of live TV, featuring the writing of Rod Serling, Paddy Chayefsky, Ira Levin, James Costigan and others. It's a delight to see famous actors as very young, unknown talents just beginning their careers. There's also Mickey Rooney giving one of his best performances in The Comedian. I think the version of Requiem for a Heavyweight here is superior to the later film version with Anthony Quinn.",1451520000,10,636,5.434343434343434
8659096,5,B00KHW4XHM,"Once again the artists at The Criterion Collection have brought us a wonderful gift. This collection of some of the best dramas - LIVE dramas - ever put on what is now sadly called ""the idiot box"", aka your television. This collection is proof that in its infancy television was well worth the investment of your time. How they pulled off such amazing performances live is probably beyond the comprehension of most of today's television producers. In listening to the interviews, which Criterion is always so good at providing, it is obvious that all involved - actors, directors, cameramen, writers - are justifiably proud and have fond memories of the work they did during this time. They also all admit to what hard work that was! Oh but to have this quality of television to watch on a regular basis again. Much appreciation to the folks at Criterion for their continuing commitment to preserve films and television for future generations. They are the gold standard. I always look for, and purchase if available, a Criterion edition over any other. They always come through with excellent craftsmanship.",1442707200,9,1108,4.962365591397849
