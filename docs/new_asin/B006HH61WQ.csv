8498433,4,B006HH61WQ,"""You're Only Young Once"" is the second of the Andy Hardy series but the first to use the familiar core cast.  Judge James K. Hardy (Lewis Stone) co-signs a note related to the first movie's real estate deal, relying on the word of Carvel newspaper publisher Frank Redmond (Frank Craven).  Judge Hardy then gets his family to agree to a vacation on Santa Catalina Island, which will let him try to catch a swordfish.  When the family gets to the California island, both son Andy (Mickey Rooney) and daughter Marian (Cecilia Parker) become attracted to unsuitable locals.  Although 'Jerry' Land (Eleanor Lynn) is the unsupervised, smoking, and drinking daughter of a multiple divorcee, she likes the fast life, which tempts Andy.  Lifeguard Bill Rand (Ted Pearson) may like feeding the seals, but he is married, though separated, and is thus not quite as suitable for Marian as she might hope.  Judge Hardy has to help prevent the new liaisons from doing too much damage.  He also has to figure out what to do when a telegram reaches him saying the original note signer can not pay it off on time.  His fishing trip gives him a large marlin, a first plane flight, and a solution to his financial crisis.  The audience learns a fair amount about the Judge's marriage to Emily (Fay Holden).  Judge Hardy dispenses much wisdom along the way.  Andy remains true to Polly Benedict (Ann Rutherford).  All the basic values and relationships are in place.

Although the 1937 black & white film may suggest naughtiness for Andy and Marian, there is nothing shown or said overtly.  There is no sex, bad language, violence, or gore.  The only skin shot is a small publicity still of the Hardy Family with Andy in his swim suit on the back of the DVD case.

The Warner Brothers made-to-order disc has both a good picture and good sound, and the movie lasts 78 minutes.  The only extra is a 3 minute trailer to the film.  Artwork and publicity stills do exist and might have been added.

""You're Only Young Once"" makes a good introduction to the Hardy family, letting us see all the ongoing actors and their characters as they start their way through the whole series.  The balance between the characters starts rather evenly here.  As the series progresses, it drifts toward becoming the Andy Hardy series, with lots of advice from the judge.  This first film is as enjoyable as any in the series.",1423180800,2,2383,4.691566265060241
