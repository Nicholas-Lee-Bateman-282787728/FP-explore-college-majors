7820221,5,6302035848,"""The Perfect Body Contest"" is striptease as it should be (and, unfortunately, almost never is, these days). Here, a strip act is actually about taking off clothes and teasing during the full three minutes or so of  each of the ten acts - not the boring lascivious routines labelled as strip  show nowadays. There's no full nudity, but as we should realize, when it  comes to eroticism and seduction, less is definitely more. Don't miss the  heart-pounding tease of Cindy (the best curves, in my opinion)and Tabatha  (wonderfully dynamic). Some funny lines too, provided by the host and a  guest comedian. Needless to say, shows of this quality are an endangered  species (check out the oldest ""Hot body"" videos for something as  good).",917654400,4,735,4.91869918699187
