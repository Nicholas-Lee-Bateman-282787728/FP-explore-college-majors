2307046,5,B0009OOPSA,"This movie is fantastic, and the whole family will love it. I have fourth and fifth grade students in a room before school starts, and they watch segments of a movie every day. They all loved this one, and asked for more movies like it.",1381449600,,236,4.266666666666667
2307047,3,B0009OOPSA,"Movie is OK.  Unfortunatelly the same movie has 2 different names (A Leap of Faith) and because I was looking for fun family movies I order the same movie twice (one under each name) until I realized they were the same.  Movie content is OK for families as I was looking (no sexual content, no graphic violence, and appropiate language).",1366588800,,337,4.6
2307048,5,B0009OOPSA,"This is a slow love story evolving between a young orphaned offender who is given a second chance in life to work with horses by the  manager of a Blind Camp, and a young gymnast who becomes blind because of a moment of non-concerntration, who's parents have sent her to the camp to get her life back.",1303257600,,301,4.280701754385965
2307049,5,B0009OOPSA,"What a great movie.  I loved to watch this because I think the acting was super and that I could watch  a great movie with my Grandchildern.
London did a great job with his parts. So glad it is on DVD.",1294099200,,201,3.8780487804878048
2307050,2,B0009OOPSA,"I've enjoyed this movie since the first time I saw it. Imagine my surprise to find it out on DVD. This movie was released more recently under a different title, Leap of Faith. No idea why. But it is nice to see that those of us who do enjoy this movie are able to get it in a nicer DVD case for a much more reasonable price. All I can say is thank goodness I did some digging around and happened to discover this wonderful movie was put out more recently even if under a different title.

This is a wonderful movie. Safe for the entire family. There was lessons learned by the main characters; the importance of keeping promises, of learning to trust others and standing up for what you believe in.

Edit: I adore this movie, however this is an edited version of the movie. Scenes that were cut had no reason to be edited out. There is nothing horrible in this movie and cutting key scenes out for no reason changed it drastically. Why is there no complete version of this movie out? Please release the complete movie and not this edited nonsense.",1286841600,11,1047,4.336734693877551
2307051,5,B0009OOPSA,This is a wonderful family movie. We got it for our daughters 13th birthday slumber party and even her brothers stopped to watch it.,1253750400,2,132,4.541666666666667
2307052,5,B0009OOPSA,It is good to find these warm hearted films that are safe to show to innocent kids that you want to keep innocent.  The story line is realistic enough to engage young minds and to develop personal value systems toward responsible behavior.,1244160000,3,239,4.690476190476191
8064281,4,B0009OOPSA,"This is a good, family-friendly movie. I love that the movie uses horse therapy as a mode of working through grief and loss issues for a teenage girl and others around her. It's a good movie, but is a bit predictable in places.",1472947200,,227,4.3023255813953485
8064282,5,B0009OOPSA,"I absolutely love this movie.  It's definitely a great movie to watch with family. There is no violence or anything of that sort. It has good moral standards. Not a chic flick by any means. It's based on a true story. It will make you cry, so grab the Kleenex before watching. Pkg received was in excellent condition. Definitely a good value money wise. I highly recommend that you watch this.",1468886400,,393,4.535211267605634

8064286,4,B0009OOPSA,The movie is great but unfortunately the movie stops half way through and you have to keep pressing play for it to continue.,1423699200,,124,4.434782608695652

8064288,4,B0009OOPSA,Saw on Animal Planet years ago it stuck with me because Jeremy London was in it well him and because it was a movie with a horse ;) It's a beautiful movie/story though. Jeremy plays a troubled teen who is great with horses and is sent to a ranch as part of his probation. There is a love story with a blind gymnast great for kids and all those horse lovers out there.,1388966400,,367,4.041095890410959
8064289,5,B0009OOPSA,"I am a ""horse lover"" and buy many DVD's about horses.  This movie is about a horse being set free from an abusive environment and a young woman being set free from her own imprisonment.",1388880000,,185,4.285714285714286
8064290,5,B0009OOPSA,"Very good really like, came on time was in good shape, I would buy form them again. ok and was more in this film than the one we had before on tape this had parts that was left out of our tape.",1382313600,,193,3.619047619047619
