2245666,4,B0007V6IWQ,"I have seen about 5 episodes from this DVD so far. The Come On Get Happy opening Credits are NOT on this DVD because those lyracs were not yet on the theme song at that time. In the first season of the show the lyracs were ""When We're Singing"". The first season theme was more about who the family was. The end credits also had a different instrumental piece  on the first season than next seasons.

The ""Come On Get Happy"" Theme was played on the openings beginning in season 2 along with an instrumental version at the end. So these episodes were as they were originally shown.

I hear reports one episode was an edited version. What likely happens here is that original airings once or twice in the course of many shows are slightly shorter than the second airings. Sometimes footage will be added on a summer rerun of a show on a network. This happens sometimes with The Simpsons. But at times the DVD puts the originally aired version on rather than the second airing version. Usually they choose the longer one but sometimes its not available. This happened with an episode of What's Happening First season. It was only cut by about 20 seconds but was noticable to fans who saw these episodes first run.

ALso the ""When We're Singing"" theme on the first season did indeed run in syndication in the 70's when Screen Gems had the rights. It was in 1982 when DFS Program Exchange got the syndication rights that the ""Come On Get Happy"" version was substituted in the first season as well as the instrumental; version at the end. Also the episodes were sliced from 25 minutes to 22 minutes. So its nice to see these in their original form again.",1115337600,8,1647,4.498327759197324
2245667,5,B0007V6IWQ,"What a treat!  This first season is everything it should be; crystal clear, a good price and great extras!

2245668,4,B0007V6IWQ,"It is great to see ""The Partridge Family"" on dvd and the quality is quite good. However, this is not a perfect release. I just finished watching ""Knight in Shining Armour,"" with Bobby Sherman as guest star, and the end of the show was edited. In the vhs tape I have, Bobby and Lionel say good-bye to the family. In the dvd, it ends with the Partridges singing ""Stephanie."" Why is this edited? Are there other edited versions on the dvd set? Also,just a note that ""Come On Get Happy"" is not played at the beginning of the shows as it was not the theme song until season two. This does have a commentary by Shirley Jones and the set is well worth owning.",1115164800,3,652,4.266129032258065

Alright, I had a crush on Susan Day and yes I thought David Cassidy could really sing.  He actually was pretty good.  I was in high school when these shows were aired.  I bought the albums and listened to them quite a lot.  I think the plots sucked, but the music was good for the time period.

2245675,5,B0007V6IWQ,"The Partridge Family was a sitcom which capitalized on  counterculture-bubblegum without scaring off middle America.

Because this is a 'family show', we do not see the group trashing hotel rooms or doing other shennanigans which I am certain are rock and roll roadtrip staples. Even the 'ladies man' and lead singer Keith Partridge (David Cassidy) is very chaste.

Season One (1970-1971) has 25 episodes and explains how the group was formed. Single mom Shirley Partridge (Shirley Jones) had to feed her family somehow. All family members get groovy crushed velvet vests, and go on tour as a rock and roll band with a Mondarin-themed school bus.

Manager Ruben Kincaid (Dave Madden) is always booking the group in 'small' joints, despite their 'megahit' status in the series---which should actually have them headlining the big venues. This 'small' booking is supposed to be part of the band's/show's charm. They are rock stars, but they are also a suburban family.

The Partridges are rock stars who get mobbed by screaming girls--- but this family also goes shopping in the local supermarket and the kids attend area public schools just like many other early 1970's suburbanites. The Patridges also still live in the same house before their band instead of moving off to a mansion which would have more accurately reflected their new earning power.

A neat series factoid is that Jones was actually David Cassidy's real-life step mom, but neither of them knew that the other had read for this series until they were cast. Both Jones and Cassidy got along in real life and during the series run. Cassidy of course played eldest son and lead singer Keith Partridge.

I like eldest daughter Laurie Partridge (Susan Dey) who balances this rock and roll career with activist tendencies, including the emergent women's movement. She is actively involved with the local (fictional) Power Of Womanhood group and tries to call her brothers on their sexist behavior in several episodes.

In ""My son the feminist"" Laurie is amused when older brother Keith Partridge attempts to convince one of HER friends that he shares the same politics---when actually he is only trying to get her to date him and could really care less about performing at a feminist political rally. Throughout the season, Laurie makes observations that her oldest brothers (including Danny Partridge) do not share simmilar social convictions.

One thing this 'family' shares is the lip-synching. Although Jones could actually sing, and Cassidy eventually launched an offscreen singing career from his Partridge Family stint, the other cast members could not cary a tune to save their own lives. The voices heard during 'performances' and on the albums are actually studio musicians.

DVD extras are a feature which can 'jump' you directly to the song being played in each episode and episodes from the tie-in cartoon 'The Partridge Family 2200 A.D'. That Hanna Barbera cartoon had the Partridge Family playing music in a Jetsons-like future, AND can actually boast of some original 'family members' doing voicework for their characters.

Even though this DVD release only offers 3 discs, I like that many of the extras are spread out over two discs instead of having been crammed onto one dic.",1109030400,22,3257,5.0919324577861165

2245684,4,B0007V6IWQ,"Here, the Partridge Family hadn't quite hit their stride yet -- the hilariously acerbic interchange between squabbling siblings was nowhere in sight; they were earnestly goody-goody of the ""Gee, Mom,"" genre except for Danny, whose character had obviously been targeted as the main comedic center with his wheeling-dealing, wise-beyond-his-years mannerisms.  It gives the show an unbalanced feel -- viewers apparently were supposed to emphasize with the romantic concerns of Shirley (she'd just been WIDOWED a few months previously, for heaven's sake!) and the clever mischief -- so-called -- of Danny's machinations, which really aren't all that funny and make the kid more than a little obnoxious.  Even in 1970, there were enough TV shows about a smarty-pants kid and/or the lovely widowed mom with men interested in her.  The rest of the Partridges just seem to be in the background, uttering their dialogue and pantomiming their music, Laurie  piping her ""meaningful"" lines about women's lib, peace, not crossing picket lines, and all the other good things about the 1970's which just sounded stilted coming out of a still-inexperienced Susan Dey; Keith more like a mod Wally Cleaver (even though he's very cute and hadn't affected that overwrought blown-dry mop of hair yet) than the bumbling yet adeptly witty, and appealing, smalltime pop idol of the second season, and of course the poor little kids are just props squeaking out tot cute-isms.  Plus, the showbiz flavor of each episode is obviously geared towards middle-aged adults in the television audience --  just like the Mad magazine satire wondered, what are these kids doing in night clubs and Las Vegas on school nights?

The worst episode is about the runaway going to Albuquerque.  I had to look up the actress on IMDB, she was so nauseating, and yep, she was born and bred in California, but out of her mouth came a ridiculously affected faux-English accent, complete with a lilting, ""Deon't you be-LIEVE me?"" as she questions the Partridges buying the veracity of her story.  And the character was supposed to be from Nebraska, too.  For some reason in the very early 1970's (I watch a lot of the baby-boomer syndicated shows of 40+ years ago on Me TV and Antenna TV) it was popular for young California actresses to put on that phony accent -- they were forever asking the detectives if they wanted some ""coh-fee"" instead of coffee.  Even Brits don't pronounce it with a long o. But the poncho-clad, hatted, snakily smirking teenybopper sleeping in the Partridges' bus as she made her way to her widowed dad's house just took the cake.

Halfway through the first season, David Cassidy suddenly burst into stardom but the attention hadn't quite sunk into him yet.  My friends and I were just turning ten years old and watching the show because of him, but we had to wade through a lot of plot devices, showbiz ""in"" talk, middle-aged people remonstrating with Reuben and Shirley over some disagreement, and Danny having some predicament far beyond his age -- being drafted into the army, being chased by gangsters, being targeted by gossip columnists as the real star of the band or a talented comedian.  We were fourth-grade teenyboppers who wanted to listen to the records and buy the magazines, and watch more teen-agey situations happening to David (God rest his soul).  But now I'll get to my review about the much-more-satisfying and genuinely funny second season of 1971-72. . . .",1469750400,,3458,4.989565217391305

2245744,4,B0007V6IWQ,"This review is dedicated to the wonderful Farrah Fawcett. Thank you for your guest appearance in this dvd set.

Well, I'm not the biggest ""Partridge Family"" fan. So, other reviewers could probably give a better review. But that said, I enjoyed this dvd set even though it was a little before my time.

If you are on this site, you probably already know that this show is about a widowed mother who joins her son Keith's band. (And of course the band of her 2 other sons, and her 2 daughters.)

While Keith runs the group, the child who often steals the show is the (impossibly smart for a 10 year old) Danny. As the 'often frustrated' Reuben says: ""I keep thinking I'm talking with a 40 year old midget.""

Very quickly, Reuben is hilarious as the often frustrated, but still loyal manager. (Who kind of doubles as a likable father figure in the absence of Shirley's husband.)

(D1) The pilot episode is well done; watch for an appearance by the wonderful Farrah Fawcett in 'The Sound of Money.' 'Private Partridge' is silly, but funny. 'But the Memory Lingers On' is also silly, but funny.

(D2) A little more serious, Danny feels he wrecked a show in: 'Did You Hear the One ABout Danny Partridge?' 'This Is My Song' has kind of a sadness to it. 'My Son the Feminist' has a decent story about going too far. 'Star Quality' has a sad lesson about what can happen when you single someone out rather than just complimenting the whole group. 'Mom Drops Out' is possibly the BEST episode in that Shirley is lead to believe she is too old to stay with the group; but the children defend her the best they can; and we see the fans REALLY WANT Shirley back.

(D3) 'A Partridge Up A Pear Tree' has a HILARIOUS episode where big spender Keith must borrow money from RICH Danny and even sign 'financial control agreements.' 'Road Song' is a great episdoe where the P Family gets mixed up with a teenage runaway, and Reuben suggests running away to Mexico is a pretty good option.

I should also say this dvd set includes 2 bonus animated episodes. One where Danny borrows Keith's car; and where Danny tries to convince his mother he made a 'space ball team.'

Overall, it's a nice dvd package.
It's wonderful to see a family perform together like this, but I think the most touching thing here is that we see that there IS LIFE after trauma. (In this case the death of Shirley Jone's husband, and how she goes on in a new direction.)

It's a nice way to have a 70s night.",1302825600,3,2460,4.434589800443459
2245745,3,B0007V6IWQ,"The last episode, the one with Bobby Sherman, is missing the tag at the end:  The scene where Bobby and Lionel say goodbye to the Partridges and Reuben and head off to L.A., and Reuben says, ""I wish I were them.""

Also, some of the scenes are blurry and the color is weak.

2245746,4,B0007V6IWQ,My grandchildren have enjoyed their DVD's of the Brady Bunch and now are into the Partridge Family.  Wholesome entertainment that also shows them a bit about life in an earlier era.,1298592000,,181,4.838709677419355
2245747,4,B0007V6IWQ,"The five Partridge kids of San Pueblo, CA, are musically gifted.  Keith (David Cassidy), 17, writes music and lyrics, sings, and plays lead guitar; Laurie (Susan Dey), about 14, ""has a social conscience,"" sings, and plays keyboards; Danny (Danny Bonaduce), the best financial and legal mind you'll find in a 10-year-old body, plays bass and sings; Chris (Jeremy Gelbwaks) is a drummer (and a baseball nut); and Tracy (Suzanne Crough), who's five, ""has perfect pitch and plays tambourine.""  It's natural that they should have started a garage band.  And when their father dies suddenly and their mother (Shirley Jones, in real life Cassidy's stepmother) has to go to work full-time, they're determined ""to help her if our music would pay.""  So Danny borrows some high-end recording equipment from his school, and when the girl they've lined up as a vocalist comes down with the mumps they persuade their mom to stand in.  The sound that results is surprisingly good, and Danny, who won't take no for an answer, manages to get it heard by the excitable Reuben Kincaid (Dave Madden), who reluctantly signs on as the family's manager--and lo and behold, they're a hit!

Based loosely on the real ""family band"" the Cowsills, the series follows the Partridges at home, in school, and on the road as they try to adjust to their sudden celebrity.  This was one of the last true ""family"" sitcoms (in the '70's the genre was changing over to the Norman Lear model that gave rise to the silly, scatological, or ""relevant"" comedies of today): funny yet gentle, relevant yet unpretentious, and helped by the very attractive and wholesome family that serves as its focus.  Some of the episodes arise from situations any family might encounter (Shirley's dad, retired plumber Fred Renfrew (Ray Bolger), suffers a later-than-midlife crisis and wants to join the group, much to the dismay of his wife Amanda (Rosemary DeCamp); Shirley encounters an old guyfriend and the kids fear it's serious; Laurie gets braces and suffers terribly from self-consciousness; Keith buys an ancient Hudson, but the expenses are so high he can't afford to take his girlfriend anywhere; Danny becomes convinced he was adopted; Keith gets overprotective wgen Laurie dates a reputed high-school Lothario); others from their status as pop idols (Reuben gets engaged, but his fiancee doesn't want him travelling with the family; Shirley wonders if ""life on the road"" is really good for the kids; Keith tries to cope with hometown groupies while struggling to gain the attention of the one girl (played by Lane Bradbury, who, as the hill girl Merry Florene, threw herself at Newly O'Brien for several seasons on ""Gunsmoke"") who won't give him a look) or from the '70's time period (Keith's new (liberationist) girlfriend tries to get the family to appear at a rally, and a morality-watchdog parents' group gets involved; a computer foulup results in Danny receiving a draft notice).  Among the guest stars are Harry Morgan (as a malingerer who tries to sue the Partridges for supposed whiplash injuries after he bumps their bus), Jackie Coogan, Morey Amsterdam, Stuart Margolin (as a convict at a minimum-security facility), then-unknown Farrah Fawcett and Jaclyn Smith, Mark Hamill (with light brown hair), Richard Pryor, and Lou Gossett.  The music is on the same innocent order as that of the early Beach Boys, focusing mostly on young-teen love, and is nicely done, though mostly by uncredited artists (Jones began in movie musicals and has a very respectable voice, as does Cassidy, who performs to this day).  Baby-boomer parents will enjoy this look back to the days of their youth, and while today's kids may find the Partridges a bit hokey, that may be all the better reason to get to know them.  This set also includes two episodes from the concurrent Hanna-Barbera cartoon series ""Partridge Family--2220 AD"" (which used several of the original voice talents) and a CD of tracks from the new collection of Partridge standards.",1292371200,,3995,5.036363636363636
2245748,5,B0007V6IWQ,"The Partridge Family premiered in 1970. Sure, it was sort of corny. But most TV shows back then were. It was a more innocent era then, and so was television. It revolved around the misadventures of a squeaky-clean, middle-class family, who decided to form a band and make records. It was based on the real-life rock-n-roll family, the Cowsills. David Cassidy, who was a teen heart-throb on the show, played the eldest brother, Keith Partridge. Laurie Partridge, played by Susan Dey, was his cover-girl-pretty younger sibling, and tended to annoy Keith on a frequent basis. His other siblings were cute, precocious-types, especially Danny Partridge (who was the 10-year-old financial wizard).

The family was headed by widow, and cool mom, Shirley Partridge (played by David Cassidy's real-life step-mom, Shirley Jones). The cast was rounded-out by their hapless Manager, Reuben Kincaid (played by rubber-faced comic Dave Madden), who always made a perfect comic-foil for Danny. The whole family sang and played instruments. They cut several albums during the course of the series, that spawned some hit singles. Their songs to me, were really quite good, especially if you like soft-rock and love ballads.

I could identify with the Partridge's suburban life-style, having grown-up in a solid middle-American, middle-class suburb myself. Some of the kids on the show were my age, and some were the same ages as my own siblings.

This show came on ABC on Friday night, following another family sitcom with several kids, the Brady Bunch. The Partridge Family even had many episodes that were so similar to some Brady Bunch episodes, they could only be called shameless rip-offs. Still, it was a gentle, family-oriented show, with good music and good acting by the cast. I always looked forward to Friday nights back then, just so I could enjoy the Partridge Family on TV.",1262044800,,1869,5.141447368421052

my favorite episode on this season is the one when the partridge family gets lost and winds up in a community where two brothers are struggling to keep their club open. the ""brothers"" were non other than richard pryor and louis gossett jr. the family is tricked into coming to the ""wrong place"" so that the club would have to fold, once the community see ""who"" will be providing the music. but then shirley convinces them that they should try anyway. so the entire family gets involved in helping the brothers to save their club. and after helping them to get rid of some unsavory hoodlums, the club is a success, and the partridge family becomes a hit with the community. i really like this episode. and wow what a blast from the past. i can't wait to complete my partridge family collection too.",1244764800,,1122,4.399038461538462

2245755,4,B0007V6IWQ,"My kids got the Partridge Family-(first season) for Christmas and they love it!  They watch it in the mini van while traveling to school and to other places. I like it because I get to listen to one of my favorite childhood shows and there is no bickering in the back seat!  In case you don't know...this series was taped in the '70's and is about a single mother raising 5 kids ages 6 to about 18. Their last name is ""Partridge"" of course.  They become a popular singing group...even the mom, played by Shirley Jones, sings in the group.  I have an 11 year old daughter and a 5 year old daughter who love music.  They have learned some of the songs, and even though they recognize the songs are not of this era they get a kick out of them all the same.  The only negative I have to say about it is the use of the word ""sexy"" here and there, mostly by Danny the ""gifted"" child with the extensive vocabulary. There are two episodes where he uses this term a bit loosely.  My girl's  favorite episode so far is when Laurie, the oldest daughter has to get braces on her teeth and is so traumatized!  They talk about how kids today like getting braces because of the cool colors that braces come in now.
If you watched this series as a kid you will love this!  If you are too young to remember, it is still really interesting to see how things come full circle with fashion and political issues.

2245767,5,B0007V6IWQ,"This is my favorite season of the Partridge Family. The show was very different the first year with the band on the road and the shows' centered around young Danny and Mr. Kincades' antics more.

The show became a big hit and because David Cassidy was a huge part of that, they started to write more lines for Keith. Keith and Danny were very funny together, but unfortunately the show became a ""living room"" comedy in the following years. The DVD transfer is not bad, but there is some room for improvement.

The extras are cool with a featurette on the casting and one on the sound and music of the group. There is an episode of the short lived cartoon 'The Partridge Family 2200 A.D.' which is hilarious to see now! A 4 song hits CD of the group and some more stuff round out the extras.

The best thing about this release is that they were able to obtain the rights to two of my favorite songs which were never released on record or any form from the first episode ""Together"" and ""Let the Good Times in"" I hope they will be able to obtain the rights from future seasons so they can release the rest of the series intact.

Danny Bonaduce is a classic. My favorite episode is when Keith moves out of the house to prove he's independent so he rents the house next door. Shirley is all proud of Keith for making it on his own even though secretly he is buying food from Danny. The scene is something like this,

""What did you get me?""

""A peanut butter sandwich and some potato chips...""

Keith inspecting the bag of chips, ""These aren't chips, this is potato dust. You want me to pay five bucks for a peanut butter sandwich and a bag of potato dust?""

""Suit yourself, Keith...""

It's great to see the series finally come to DVD!

I can now ""retire"" my Columbia House VHS tapes!

The series is very innocent and very funny as well. The

writing is quite good compared to several other sitcoms of

that time period. It seems that there was alot of ""thought""

put into each and every episode!

I hate to think that Susan Dey has a problem talking about

the series. She should be proud to be part of something

so fondly remembered by the fans.

I met Shirley Jones several years ago while she was

performing at a small theater in my hometown in Ohio. I

worked as an Assistant Front Desk Manager at the hotel

she stayed at. She is one classy and fantastic woman.

She is one of the nicest women you will ever meet!

She took time out of her busy schedule to autograph my

comic book, record and lunchbox. I treasure these items

to this day!

I enjoy all of her work but she will always be SHIRLEY

PARTRIDGE to me!

The DVD packaging is bright and eye catching-the picture

quality very good. I do love the JUKEBOX that allows you

to jump to the individual music performances.

This of course being back in 1999, and I knew little about the series and its successes, combining this normal family that became an actual band. I was SO SO SO happy to finally have it available on DVD. The extras are great with commentary with Jones and Bonaduce and I liked the Sound of the Partridge. I honestly believe that the Partridge Family was much better when it came to the writing as compared to the Brady Bunch. At least in the Partridge house you had more than four bedrooms, a bathroom that included a toilet and NO ASTROTURF!!! The guest appearances are awesome like Farrah Fawcett, Mark Hamill, Jaclyn Smith, and Ray Bolger as grandpa. So go ahead and sing along!!

Come On Now and Meet Everybody and hear us singing. Nothing better than being together when we're singing, Five of us and mom working all day we knew we could help her if our music could play, Danny got Reuben to sell our song and it really came together when mom sang along, come on now and meet everybody and hear us singing hear us singin, hear us singing!!",1149897600,,1167,4.328767123287672

And the one where the skunk stows away on their bus!

2245782,5,B0007V6IWQ,"I really loved this show when it was originally aired, but since it hasn't been rerun that often I've always wondered whether I loved it because I was young at the time or because it was a good show.  Well, after watching these DVDs I can honestly say it was a terrific show.  The writing was unique and the music is classic.  This show always seems to be compared to the Brady Bunch, but I think it is much better, maybe because the Bradys have been rerun to death.  This first season DVD collection has some really nice extras too.",1145664000,2,533,4.3
2245783,1,B0007V6IWQ,"Being born in '68 I sometimes have to rely on reruns for memories sake, even still, this show was a VERY distant memory. Perhaps it was because it didn't get as much rerun airtime as Lucy or the Bradys, but I see now the real reason; the show was absymal was so it didn't enjoy a long shelf life.

I've been buying as many of this ""era sets"" as I can get a hold of, many are good, some are even great, and some are a ""surprise"". So, a gamble is sometimes all you have and it works both ways. Leave it to Beaver was a definite welcome surprise, Land of the Lost was not. The Partridge Family is not.

The acting is so painful to watch. The scripts are so lousy (Ten year old Danny gets drafted!?). The music is so grating (and I LIKE the Brady music). The guest stars are equally terrible (the grandfather/grandmother). I really cannot for the life of me figure out how a show like THIS lives on. Are people really this thick? It really makes me question television in general. I mean if this ISN'T bad television then WHAT IS!??

Here's what I did like about it; the opening credits and song is very nostalgic, Reuben Kincaid and Danny's chemistry, and the fact that David Cassidy and Susan Dey look like brother and sister. That's IT! And out of 25 epsiodes that ain't much.",1137456000,4,1275,4.282157676348548

WHEN THE SERIES IS COMPLETED OF THE PF THAN I WILL BUY . IT COST SONY ALOT OF BUCKS TO GET MUSIC RIGHTS TO THIS SHOW. SO IF THE PROFITS ARE DOWN ON SELLING THIS SHOW. THAN IT WILL NOT FINISH TO THE END. THATS WHY I WILL WAIT. BUT GOOD NEWS TO PARTRIDGE FANS. SEASON 2 WILL BE RELEASED IN NOVEMBER AS I READ ON TV ON DVD OF NEW RELEASES TO COME. IN MY TITLE I WROTE FAKE PERFORMANCE. THATS BECAUSE IT WAS A RECORD RECORDING PLAYING DURING THERE PERFORMANCE IN THE SHOW. THE STUDIO HAD TO AMPLIFY THE VOICE OF DAVID CASSIDY TO MAKE HIM SOUND GOOD CAUSE HIS OWN SINGING WAS TERRABLE. WHEN HE DID LIVE PERFORMANCE AT HIS CONCERTS THE PEOPLE DID'NT CARE ABOUT HIS SINGING ALL THEY DID IS WANT TO BE THERE TO SEE HIM.,1125273600,4,889,4.056818181818182
2245786,4,B0007V6IWQ,"The Partridge Family's entry into the DVD format was exciting for me!  I was 5 when the show debuted, and excited then too because I already loved pop music, thanks to the Monkees. And coincidentally enough, my name's Tracy and my little sister's name is Laurie.  The shows are still a lot of fun to watch, and I was struck by how much ""Danny and the Mob"" is like a Monkees episode, particularly the romp-style chase during ""That'll Be the Day.""

The shows are fun, and I'm glad they included episodes of the awful cartoons.  The extras leave a bit to be desired, however, with no scene selections, and no on-screen descriptions of the episodes.  I'm also always disappointed with Susan Dey's decision not to participate in any PF projects.  She really has nothing to be ashamed of, and the Partridge Family certainly trumps much of her adult work.  And I, like many others, would like the Screen Gems closer reinstated.  At least the Season 1  theme song was returned, unlike in syndication.

It's great to see these episodes looking so good again.  I'm going to loan my set to my sister so my 5-year-old niece can get a glimpse of what her mom and Aunt Tracy enjoyed over 30 years ago!",1124668800,16,1187,4.55188679245283

2245788,5,B0007V6IWQ,"Less saccharin than ""The Brady Bunch"" and less silly than ""The Monkees"" (noted exception with the notorious chicken episode), this sitcom somehow captured that which is good about sitcoms (if there is such a thing).  With apologies to the actors playing Chris and Tracy, the enjoyment of the show comes heavily from the interactions of its five leads:  Mom Shirley, Handsome but flaky Keith, Passionate Laurie, Conniving but adorable Danny, and their rumpled manager, Reuben Kincaid.  In sitcom world it is no secret that the storylines are often excuses for the characters to create interesting chemistry, and, when casting is well-done, these character relationships can keep an otherwise vacuous series on the air for years.  It was, then, a very happy stroke of luck that brought this crew together.  Nowadays, the oft-repeated stories of how this series was cast leave one to wonder that it came together at all.  And yet, it did, and you find yourself not only liking this group of people, but thinking it would be nice to know someone like them.  Need I forget, one must also mention the music.  Dismissed as ""bubble-gum"" pop by folks of that era (not to mention today!) the music was a major player, as many of the episodes were created solely for the purpose of backing up one song or another (most notably ""Point Me in the Direction of Albuquerque"").  In other words, if you don't like the music, you are sunk.  The reality is, however, many of us do like the music ... a lot.  Yes, hundreds of us busy professionals with our families and our complex lives in the post 9/11 world actually enjoy pulling down the blinds late at night and secretly cranking up ""I Think I Love You"" or ""Come On, Get Happy"" just to put a smile on our face.  Try it - you might be pleasantly surprised at how good you feel when you listen to music which is actually upbeat.  Speaking of which, the DVD set (short on extras but with a neat ""jump to the song"" feature) should lose a point due to lame commentary.  I know it's a clich, but producers need to realize that good commentary is worth its weight in gold and bad commentary - well it just puts a bad taste in your mouth to waste your time.  The talented and sweet Shirley Jones does one episode, but mostly just giggles and ""mmm-hmms"" throughout.  Danny Bonaduce does one episode and resorts to his now trademark humor, which is to say, more than a step over the line of mean (""Hey, that's something you'll never see, Susan Dey eating!"").  Ditch the commentary and just watch the episodes.  And don't feel guilty if you feel the urge to get up off the couch and sing along.",1123632000,4,2618,4.581545064377682
2245789,5,B0007V6IWQ,"Wow! Having watched only the first two DVD's of Season 1 so far over the past week, I had to stop by here and mention how thrilling it is to see The Partridge Family again! Sure, we all know the show itself was great. But this DVD set also comes loaded with some great extra features. For the price I just don't see how any Partridge Family fan could say no.

I don't remember The Partridge Family meaning so much to me when the show originally aired, when I was quite young. Except that I'm pretty sure Susan Dey was my first crush (and I instantly remembered why while watching episode one!).

There is so much I'd forgotten about this show--Danny's precociousness, Mr. Kinkaid's furrowed brow, that crazy bus, the hilariously awful lip-synching, and something I never noticed when I was just a kid: Shirley Jones looks pretty fine in a mini-skirt!

And of course, when the show originally aired, I didn't realize who guest stars like Farrah Fawcet, Jaclyn Smith, and Mark Hamill were (or would later become, to be precise). What a great surprise to see these up-and-coming stars, along with established greats like Ray Bolger (The Wizard of Oz's ""Scarecrow"") and Jackie Coogan (The Addam's Family's ""Uncle Fester"").

The special features are a mixed bag. There's an excellent documentary describing how the show came to be, including recent interviews with some cast members. There's also a brief documentary showing the men and women who actually made the music. I've always thought David Cassidy had a fabulous voice, so it was funny to learn that no one even bothered to hear him sing before he was cast as Keith Partridge. Some episodes have commentaries by Danny Bonneduce and Shirley Jones that, while fairly short of talk and inside information, are still a gas to listen to. There's also a sampler CD of four classic Partridge Family songs. It's a rather blatant marketing tool for the greatest hits CD, but I already have the CD, so it was a genuine bonus for me.

Overall, this is just plain a fun ride. In my opinion, The Partridge Family was superior to The Brady Bunch because it was always upbeat (The Brady's could get so depressing with their guilt and shame sometimes). Like the ""Cheers"" theme song, the Partridge Family theme really sums up what the show was all about: Come On, Get Happy!

The only negative thing I'd say is shame, Shame, SHAME on Sony for replacing the original ding-a-ling-a-ling episode ending with their own lame logo and ""music"". That sound was completely associated with this show in my mind after so many viewings as a kid, and Sony's idiotic decision to replace it may ruin that memory for me forever. Why can't these arrogant corporations leave the classics alone? I can only hope Sony will restore the original ding-a-ling thing in upcoming season sets.",1123459200,6,2802,4.7670103092783505
2245790,5,B0007V6IWQ,"I was a five-year old child when The Partridge Family first hit the airwaves. I did not become a Partridge Family fan until I was an adult. I love this DVD set. I was a bit dissapointed that at least one of the episodes seemed to be edited. I have no idea why, but it did not prevent me from enjoying every single episode. I love how Shirley Jones is an understanding mother. David Cassidy is adorable. I'm sorry that I missed his big teen idol days. I was 11 or 12 when his brother Shaun was on the Hardy Boys. Danny can be a bit too much, but I love how he drives Rueben crazy and gets Keith into comical situations.

2245792,5,B0007V6IWQ,"Okay, Is it me or does this television musical family just rub off on everybody.  I was a kid when the Partridge family came out and yes I thought they were a real band, and yes I wanted to be David Cassidy, and yes I just like the songs that I wanted to be in a band someday.  Well I am a musician and I still can't get those songs out of my head.

So I bought this DVD for my 7 year old daughter to watch and guess what she's hooked.  Who knows maybe one day she'll be a musician someday.  I don't think she's as naive as I was because she does ask if this is really a musical group.

This is a great DVD collection and she can't wait for the the 2nd season to come out.

2245793,5,B0007V6IWQ,"I got this to complement my purchase of the Brady Bunch on DVD and have watched just about every episode while the Brady DVD remains barely touched.  Part of that is because in the first season of the Brady's, the kids were very, very small and the classic episodes didn't happen until they grew up a bit, whereas the Partridge's are of varying ages (smart, smart move) and they're mobile.  They're on the go all the time, they sing, they have fun adventures and Shirley Jones is perfect as the pretty, hip mom.  Plus, the show is very, very funny.  Danny Bonaduce and Dave Madden (as Reuben Kincaid) are perfectly matched for one another and Bonaduce always has a good line.  Sure, some of the episodes haven't aged well, but don't let that hamper your enjoyment; every episode is still worth seeing.  Rediscovering the Partridge's was an unexpected pleasure, and with a sampler CD included, as well as two episodes of the ""Partridge Family 2200"", the ill-conceived (but amusing nonetheless) futuristic Jetson's rip-off cartoon from 1974, it's well worth the purchase.",1121904000,5,1069,4.878453038674033

2245797,5,B0007V6IWQ,"I was nine years old when 'The Partridge Family' hit the airwaves on Friday evenings in 1970.  Sandwiched in between 'The Brady Bunch' and 'Love, American Style,' you just didn't do much else when the weekend hit (not that there were many options available when you were nine(!)).  I've always thought the first season of 'The Partridge Family' was the best - the first wave of 'Partridgemania' for us little kids, the wonderful music, and the sheer innocent fun of the show.  Personally, I think the color transfers are great on the DVD (much better than my Columbia House PF videos that are available) and several of the extra features are fun.  It's always great to listen to people like Shirley Jones, David Cassidy and Danny Bonaduce look back fondly on what must have been a wonderful experience.  Hopefully, by the issuance of the second season, we'll be able to hear memories from Brian Forster, Suzanne Crough...and, hopefully, Dave Madden?  My understanding is that Susan Dey, sad to say, still refuses to give interviews about her Partridge experiences.

Apart from the episodes themselves, it's great to hear interviews with the Bahler brothers, Jackie Ward, Michael Melvoin and Bernard Slade (Wes Farrell has since passed on) on the vital roles they played in the development of the musical style and the production of the show.  These are folks who haven't been given as much credit as they deserve; it's nice that they are featured in this set.  All in all, everybody involved with this classic television show can be proud of their achievement.  It's why people like me can look back and be thankful, and grateful, that their childhoods included something as fun and as positive as this wonderful program.",1117670400,11,1721,4.923875432525952
2245798,5,B0007V6IWQ,"There was so much about the Partridge Family that made you love them. From their catchy songs to the funky, velvet suits they ""performed"" in, to that groovy, multi-colored bus they rode to the gigs, they were a warm, funny and unique TV family/rock band.

I was but an infant when the show premiered in 1970, but when it ran in syndication, it was a part of my early childhood and watching it again now brings back memories I thought I had long forgotten.

Shirley Jones was the cool and attractive TV mom everyone wished they had while David Cassidy (Keith, the teen hearthrob), Susan Dey (Laurie, the socially conscious big sister), Danny Bonaduce (Danny, the clever & witty kid), Jeremy Gelbwaks and Suzanne Crough (Chris and Tracy, the youngest siblings) made up this classic TV family.

And, of course, who could forget Dave Madden as Rueben Kincaid, the group's often frantic and exasperated manager? He and Bonaduce provided much of the comedy for the show.

The theme song for the first season, ""When We're Singin'"", would become the ever memorable ""Come On Get Happy"" in the seasons to follow, which is my only gripe. I mean, what's The Partridge Family without the theme song we all know and love? Fourtunately, ""Come On Get Happy"" is one of the 4 songs on the music sampler CD included here, along with the other P.F. staple, ""I Think I Love You"".

The Partridge Family is classic 70's TV full of music, laughs and fun! Order it and ""Get Happy"" all over again - Enjoy!",1117497600,3,1479,4.629770992366412
2245799,5,B0007V6IWQ,"I have long awaited this release. For any fan or lover of classic sitcoms this is a sure winner. I would have hoped Sony would have put more creativity than they did on interviews, and a more indepth  look at the show. The four song bonus while nice seemed more of a let down than a must have. I would have liked more material from the show. The sound is very good, and the video is as good as it gets for 70's sitcoms. The sound in some areas is slightly distorted, especially with the music, but not overly annoying. Heck, for playback via a tv speaker I'm surprised at how far they went to dolby 2ch. The interviews are ok, but nothing to write home about. One area that does irritate me is Danny's cutsey comments. Great price on this one. Looking forward to dvd season #2 soon.....Ray",1117497600,,789,4.295302013422819
2245800,5,B0007V6IWQ,"You know why the Partridge Family is a good show?  Because the Brady Bunch makes this family look like a love-in.  Sure, this show had its saccharine and unbelievable moments, but you can forgive them next to Marsha Brady's ""oh my nose!"" episode.  Usually, this show is quite believable in the family's music business predicaments, and also the writing is quite good.

Danny Bonaduce and Dave Madden had great chemistry as a comedy team, but they were also quite close off the set of the show as well.  The two youngest kids are cute, if stiff, as actors, Susan Dey was good as budding teenage feminist Laurie, and Shirley Jones has always been a pleasure in most any venture she's undertaken.  Must I really mention that, just like every other little girl and teenager back in the early 70's, I had a crush on David Cassidy?  I was also at the right age to develop a crush on younger brother Shaun a few years later.

If you grew up with this show like I did and wish they'd run it on cable somewhere, this box set should be quite pleasing.  My favorite episodes, to name a few, are the pilot, the incident with the skunk, and when Laurie gets braces.  After all these years, I can admit the songs aren't so bad either.

Extras include music performances, interviews, two episodes of the short-lived Saturday morning cartoon, and Shirley Jones commenting on one of the best episodes.  The Partridge family is 25 episodes, and then some, of good clean fun for the entire family with a lesson generally involved.  It will take you back in time where, ironically, you will recognize some of the popular clothing and hairstyles as part of your own wardrobe now.

This woman picked up hitch-hikers, let strange men share beds with her sons, and horror of horrors, allowed her beautiful boy Keith to sleep in a prison with horny criminals.

Sure, there are things that annoy me about the show, like why isn't EVERY episode about Keith...lol...but this is inexpensive enough to be what it is, a sitcom from the early 70's. As others have said, it's been fun to see who showed up in guest spots on the show and in addition to those previously mentioned, Jaclyn Smith shows up in one, too! The Partridge Family is what it is...a harmless family show with laughs, music and one hot teen idol. No more, no less. Enjoy watching it!",1116633600,6,894,4.359281437125748

""Come On Get Happy"" the theme to The Partridge Family show has not yet evolved from ""When We're Singin'"" but that's okay.  The writing was pretty sharp and Danny Bonaduce is hilarious as the midget businessman of the family.

2245804,5,B0007V6IWQ,"In my opinion this is one of the most underrated prime time series in TV history.  Well documented differences between David Cassidy, who became the all-time teen idol,  and the shows producers brought the series down.  Before that, however, the music was really outstanding considering that the songs were written specifically for the show, performed (w/ the exception of Cassidy and Shirley Jones) by studio musicians and packaged to appeal to middle America.  The scripts were good and the characters played off each other well.  The series was really Cassidy, Jones, Dey, Bonaduce and Dave Madden (Ruben Kincaid).  The 2 youngest kids were useless props in the background.  Definitely recommend season 1.  After that, buyer beware.",1116288000,,735,5.275862068965517
2245805,4,B0007V6IWQ,"I have fond memories of the Patridge Family, having watched it as a 9 year old. Watching it on DVD brought back some great memories and made me smile. I even remember liking the songs. Eeek! Don't tell anyone.......

However, while I was okay with the picture quality considering the show's age, I was not impressed with the compression of so many episodes on 1 disc. Some of the episodes jumped which became very frustrating. (it's not my player- I have a high quality player)I also experienced this same problem with The Brady Bunch- Season 1. Too many episodes on 1 disc!!!

On the Partridge Family set, I could have done without the CD sampler. I'll buy the greatest hits if I want to listen to the music. Besides, there is a ""jump to musical selections"" on the DVD menu.

I know the executives are looking to keep costs down but please don't compromise the quality! I think I'd rather spend a few more bucks for more discs or if they can use the double-sided discs, that might make it a little better.

I really wished they listened to the people buying these sets once in a while!",1116201600,3,1086,4.46969696969697
2245806,4,B0007V6IWQ,"The first thing that must be said after watching these shows (in full for the first time)is that I was impressed with the writing. Keeping in mind that it was a sitcom, the writing is pretty sharp, much sharper than The Brady Bunch.

Look fast, not only for the ""Before they were famous"" pop ups of people like Farrah Fawcett, Louis Gossitt Junior(with hair!), Richard Pryor and others but for the houses. The Partridge family lives on the ""street"" with the houses from ""Bewitched"", ""I Dream Of Jeannie"", ""Hazel"" and others.

You even see Keith Partridge drop off a date of his in front of the ""Bewitched"" house. Reusing these house facades was done over and over again in Screen Gems shows. It's fun to pick them out.

The shows are nicely cleaned up and sharp but fall short when it comes to the color.

On most shows, the color is not as rich as I'd expect from other releases of late 60's, early 70's color shows (which were made to showcase color TV which was newer and more expensive). Most properly done DVD releases of color shows of this era have a rich technicolor sheen (like The Brady Bunch, Star Trek and Here's Lucy).

Here, it looks like the color was dialed back a bit. While this doesn't make it an inferior transfer, it makes it less reflective of the time it was shown. The biggest effect of this is the lack of color in the skin tones. Where most shows of this period show skin tones looking pretty rich and colorful, on this DVD they are subdued.

The mono sound is fine and represents the soundtrack well.

The set loses a bit on the restoring of ephemeral bits that probabaly weren't seen since the original airings. Both Hogan's Heroes and Brady Bunch releases restored the opening ""In Color"" bumpers to beginnings of all the shows. I wish it was also done for PF.

Also, someone else mentioned that the original ""Screen Gems"" logo was delteted at the end as well (although I never found it scary). My memory of the yellow/orange background Screen Gems logo is inseperably tied to shows like Partridge Family, Bewitched, Gidget, I Dream Of Jeannie and others. Replacing it with the new Sony logo is jarring (just as it was jarring to have the SG logo replaced with Columbia Tristar before in syndication and tapes). It's a little thing but to buy a vintage show on DVD is to hope they get the little details like that right.

And yes, one show is edited. I know that even though I'm no PF expert. Shows of this time were expected to run at least 25 minutes sans commercials. The final episode of the season runs a bit over 23 minutes and is missing the tag. The least you should expect from purchasing shows on DVD is for the shows to be unedited. This appears to be an oversight so maybe it will be corrected.

The extras include featurettes and commentary and do thier part of giving little known details on the show. The best is a feature on the musicians that ""augmented"" the Partridge Family.

I have to admit the most fun extra was the couple bonus episodes of the Animated spin off ""Partridge Family 2200 AD"". As a fan of the good, bad and the ugly of 1970's Saturday Morning TV I loved seeing this. I never saw this when it was originally on (must of been busy watching Bugs Bunny) but it is a hoot. It looks like an excuse for Hanna Barbara to use the Partridge Family name and to reuse a lot of thier ""The Jetsons"" backgrounds. The writing is awful, of course, but so familiar to creatures of 1970's Saturday Morning that it works despite itself.

Note to DVD makers, do this whenever possible. Include a couple of the animated spin off series on the DVD release.

I'm hoping they put a couple of ""Jeannie""s on ""I Dream Of Jeannie"", ""Emergency+4""'s on Emergency and so on. C'Mon people, it's something in your vaults you can drag out and call it an extra with no extra work. It's part of the history of the live action show and of interest to it's fans.

Anyway, this set is not perfect but still reccomended to fans of the 1970's, classic TV and fun shows.

The transfers are good (even if the color is slightly lacking) and the extras are nice with the long overdue start of putting sample episodes of the animated spin off as part of the extras.",1115942400,106,4182,4.441253263707572
2245807,4,B0007V6IWQ,"I've been watching this set an episode or two at a time since I bought it, and I've gotta say it's brought a smile to my face each time. Yes the show is a bit dated, but it's sweet and good family entertainment.

It's great to see the shows intact, with such great sound and picture quality ( also glad to see the episodes with the original first season theme, as they originally aired! ) My one real gripe is that the final episode, ""Knight In Shining Armor"" is actually missing the end tag segment, which was included on the commercially released VHS version. In this the two guest characters pack up and head out ( to a short lived spin-off called ""Getting Together"" ), while Reuben Kincaid wistfully tells the Partridges that he ""envies"" them the adventures that lie ahead for them. You needn't fret Reuben...you got the better end of the deal.

Despite that one glaring ommision, I am delighted with this set and am looking forward to more.",1115942400,3,945,4.52046783625731
2245808,5,B0007V6IWQ,"It only took until their 35th anniversary for Sony to loosen the locks on their vault to finally present one of the best TV sitcoms to come out of the seventies! The Partridge Family was a money making phenomenon and it makes me wonder why the Sony execs have taken so long to bring this show out of seclusion. Due to extremely high syndication rights, this show has only seen limited airplay on classic television, much to the dismay of its fans. Well, now the time is here to ""C'mon Get Happy!"" once again. This set features 25 episodes of the first season, including the series pilot which captured the nation by storm!

Starring Oscar nominated actress/singer Shirley Jones and her real life stepson, 70s pop icon David Cassidy, the show focuses on the exploits of a single widowed mom and her five children who tour the country in a Mondrian painted school bus and play their hearts out for audiences from Caesars Palace to local night clubs. Rounding out the cast is fifteen year old activist/feminist, Laurie (played wonderfully by NY model Susan Dey), 10 year old finanacial mogel, Danny (played to the tee by comedic genius Danny Bonaduce) and seven year old Chris (them played by Jeremy Gelbwaks later replaced by Brian Forster) and tamborene banging, five year old Tracy (played by Suzanne Crough). As a kid, I loved this group and was disappointed to learn they didn't really sing. But the songs and stories were quite good and funny and they won me over! Despite comments by ney-sayers, the stories were fun, solid and actually quite well written. The family was not perfect by the standards of their fore-runners and actually fought and argued and played pranks on each other, but in the end, there was a solid family foundation of love and togetherness sadly lacking in today's television. Each episode revolved around a song which most critics sighed that were moralistic and tied in with the story, but then again, isn't that what song writers do? Write about life experiences? I think people fought too hard against this show. In it's simplisticness, it is funny, touching and extremely enjoyable and addictive. 35 years later, I still enjoy David Madden's dead pan exasperation as the Partridge's harried manager, Reuben Kincaid as he realzes once again, he has been foiled by Danny Partridge. Filled with guest stars making their television debut are the likes of Jackyn Smith, Farrah Fawcett, Lou Gossett Jr, Richard Pryor, Bobby Sherman and many more. The first year of Partridges follow their exploits on the road whereas subsequent seasons show them more at home. This does not fail the show in any way, however, yet makes the freshness and newness of the magical first season stand out above the rest.

As to the production value, to the trained eye, some DVD enthusiasts may say these were not cleaned up but whereas the show was safely locked away there is little to complain about. The colors are beautiful, the picture and sound quality are excellent. Extras include two episodes of Hanna Barbera's Partridge Family 2200 A.D. featuring voice overs by Susan Dey, Danny Bonaduce, Suzanne Crough and Brian Forster. Plus a bonus sampler CD disc from ""C'mon Get Happy: The Very Best Of The Partridge Family"" by Arista, plus features ""Jump To Musical Performances"" also two short documentries featuring David Cassidy, Shirley Jones and Danny Bonaduce and one about the music of the Partridges. Although short in length, the documentaries are fun to watch. Overall, a great package and a great price! Worth EVERY penny of the purchase price to view these in order!!! Thanks Sony for finally providing me with a time capsule to teleport me back to my favorite childhood years! Bring on Season Two, three and four and blow us away with the extras!!!!",1115683200,21,3770,4.870716510903427
2245809,2,B0007V6IWQ,"I knew it was eventually going to come to DVD, but nothing could have prepared me for when I finally saw this in the store. I hated this show as a kid and can't even watch it with nostalgia. Danny Partridge was the ugliest little smart arse ever to be put in front of the camera. Everytime I saw him I just wanted to beat him up. Watching him play his bass guitar like it was a six-string just made me wince all the more.

The show was totally unbelievable, the characters inane, and the stories were borderline insanity. I'll never forget the episode with Richard Pryor. The Partridge van breaks down in the ghetto or something and they run into a club owner who's trying to save his club. Make a long story short, The Partridges perform for a bunch of 70's style pimps and gangstas, and at the end Danny is an honorary Black Panther complete with beret!

This was not good television no matter how you look at it.",1115596800,3,915,4.313953488372093
2245810,5,B0007V6IWQ,"When I started seeing The Munsters, Green Acres, and Mr. Ed on DVD, I knew it wouldn't be long before my generation would be represented in DVD/TV land.  The Partridge Family was a personal favorite of mine when I was seven or eight years old.  I was afraid time wouldn't be kind to this show.  Boy, was I wrong!  The transfer looks crisp - especially for a 70's TV show.  The songs are still hummable (I dare you not to sing along with Together (Having a Ball), and let's face it guys, Shirley Jones was HOT!  I've read the other comments about the songs used in the opening credits.  I'm glad they used the original ""When We're Singin'"" opening.  While I liked ""Come On Get Happy"" better, the DVD stays true to the original broadcasts.  Finally, my three kids, ages 10, 5, and 4, think the show is fantastic.  Now I will be able to whip one of these bad boys out the next time I am subjected to another insufferable episode of Full House on Nick.  The kids will be happy and I will too!  A great deal for the price.....not to mention a fun walk down memory lane!",1115596800,5,1064,4.265
2245811,5,B0007V6IWQ,"Awesome!  Did this bring back many fond memories.  Didn't really care for The Partridge Family 2200 AD animated crap.. but the first season episodes and the special features were great.  I would have liked to seen a few thinks like:

Interviews with Susan Dey, Jeremy Gelbwaks (if they could find him), Suzanne Crough, Dave Madden.  An explaination why they got rid of Simone after the first season.  How they filmed the music scenes and what the ""kids"" really sounded like as they ""played"" the insturments.

One thing I did notice after watching this DVD was, they keep saying Chris and Tracy didn't get very many parts, but they sure got a lot more speaking roles in the first season than they did after that.  Chris got some pretty good lines.. and I don't care how bad Jeremy Gelbwaks was on the set or how often he kicked Danny, I liked him a hell of a lot better than Brian Forster.  Hmmmm  wonder what Jeremy looks like now???

2245812,4,B0007V6IWQ,"For starters, the price on this can't be beat. The show is charmingly retro, looks great, audio quality is great, and the silly costumes can't hide the fact that Shirley Partridge is the hottest mom you ever saw (next to my wife of course).

As someone who prefers that reissues not reinvent history I was glad that the first season theme song ""When We're Singing"" (which has the same melody as ""C'mon Get Happy"") was left intact. This is the theme song I remember.

So far I've only viewed the first two episodes but what a kick recognizing Harry Morgan (M*A*S*H) and a very young Farrah Fawcett in episode two. And the first episode, the man in black himself, Johnny Cash! The shows may be standard sitcom fare but what makes them unique is that you can play these DVDs with the kids around, no predictable double entendres, no tacky wisecracks, no characters trying to impress us with how ""edgy"" they are.

Although pre-order buzz suggested that a number of unreleased songs would be included on a bonus CD, what you get is a four song promotional CD for the companion ""greatest hits"" audio CD. Includes three of the most popular tracks from the first Partridge Family album as well as ""C'mon Get Happy"". Whole bonus audio CD clocks in at about ten minutes in length.

Well, maybe the absence of rarities is not a bad thing after all. The two unreleased songs from the pilot episode are only ""Partridge Family songs"" because they appear in the show but they don't have the Partridge sound and all vocals are handled by a faceless studio chorus. Worse yet, these two songs, ""Together (Having A Ball)"" and ""Let The Good Times In"", sound like they came from the same people who recorded generic songs for the Scooby Doo cartoons. The only notable thing about these two throwaways is that Neil Sedaka gets a writing credit on the latter song. As my wife came in I found myself embarrassed and explaining, ""this isn't the Partridge Family singing in the first episode, they didn't know David Cassidy could sing yet.""

With a price point like this there's bound to be some cut corners somewhere. In this case you get no accompanying booklet or sleeve with the DVD, just case and disks. If you're curious what songs are associated with which episode, or other details that you might expect with a DVD set, you'll just have to watch the shows or use the ""jump to the songs"" feature.

Seeing as the Partridge Family's music continued charting in the top 40 throughout the second season perhaps a Season Two DVD set will appear in six months. If that happens hopefully the final disk of that set will be an audio compilation of all the unreleased songs from seasons one and two. Just not the two throwaways from the pilot episode.",1115337600,8,2723,4.615702479338843
2245813,5,B0007V6IWQ,"It's really like 4 7/8 stars. The package is great, the sound and picture quality are good, and the bonus CD is a nice extra, all at a fantastic price. I'm just curious as to why Sony edited out the original Screen Gems closing logo, after they went to so much trouble to make sure the other components of the episodes were true to their original form, including restoring the original opening song and credits. I have mixed emotions about this, as I truly believe that the 1965-1974 Screen Gems logo is the scariest thing to ever come out of a television set, but from a purist's/collector's standpoint it should have been included. Other than that very minor quibble, it's a fantastic set.",1115337600,5,691,4.626016260162602

I can't even find this offer anyplace else. Such a deal!

I can't comment on the set because it's not mine to open; but my sister was around 9 when the series premiered back in 1970, so I'm sure she'll get a real bubble-gum days groovy feeling from revisiting that past.",1115337600,3,536,4.36
