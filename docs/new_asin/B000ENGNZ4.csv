8111613,2,B000ENGNZ4,"This could have used a bit more professional production values and better pacing, but it gives you some idea of how hard it is to run against an incumbent politician (Jeff Smith, who appears in this movie, had a much better documentary shot about his eventual race against another Missouri political heavyweight, Russ Carnahan). It's hard to really take the guy running seriously, but nonetheless worth the few bucks I paid to rent it.",1389916800,,435,4.891891891891892
8111614,2,B000ENGNZ4,"Yes, it's reasonable to complain about the two-party system in the US.  However, this documentary is just as wobbly and all-over-the-place as 3rd party candidates tend to be.  You couldn't tell if the narrator or the Libertarian candidate was the main focus of the work.  The candidate needed a campaign staff and practically seemed like he pulled people off the street for those positions.  It takes money to run a successful campaign and the candidate seemed shocked about that.  To me, Libertarians are just Republican Lite, yet this guy was at all these progressive, peacenik events.  I never got the sense that the Libertarian Party of Missouri really backed him.  One person who considered supporting him said, ""I don't like the way that elected officials don't keep jobs here.""  However, Gephardt, the incumbent, is known for being labor-friendly and would have that as one of his main goals.  The Green candidate looked like a hippie.  His dreadlocks were coming apart.  He never seems to realize that some African-Americans voters may look at his hairstyle as offensive cultural appropriation.  The documentary interviews a Washington University professor who had the most annoying voice.  I can't imagine any student wanting to sit through his lectures.  In so many ways, this work tried to be sophisticated like Michael Moore but on a shoestring budget.  It does not succeed.  There's no mention of how Jesse Ventura, Ross Perot, and other 3rd-party candidates who have name recognition also became their own worst enemies and didn't last long in the political scene.  Folks say the camera adds pounds, but many here are just on the super-chunky side (like myself).  The candidate complained about people eating food at his picnic but then doing nothing to support him.  Hello!  That's politics.  I am quite sure that not everyone who has shook Bush's or Clinton's hands ended up voting for them.  If that indifference bothers a candidate, then why are they running?!  Roger Ebert condemned the film ""Team America"" because he said the work implied that anyone who cares about politics is stupid.  This documentary had that same bitter, hypercritical tone where the makers only wanted to critique and not construct.  I almost think that the people who would enjoy this work the most are those who have no intention of voting under any circumstances.  Trust me!:  this work is absolutely ineffective in trying to rupture the current two-party system.",1189209600,,2459,5.0825
