8061303,3,B0009INOYW,"""Secrets of Pool Hustling"" is 30 minutes of aimless self-aggrandized storytelling about trophies, ""Ed"", cash, sandwiches and Pepsi, promptly followed by 30 minutes of bizarre insanity, whereupon the Floydster dramatically re-enacts a real-life hustle. This hustle is accomplished by taking $2500 off Steve Mizerak in a game of five-card draw, receiving a tip from a drunk junkie regarding a bar one town over that's ripe for hustling, calling ""Fred,"" dressing up like a painter with cans and ladders, ignorantly sweet-talking the wife of the bar owner, and then duping a local fat man into into losing countless games of 9-ball to the tune of $5000. The credits then roll and the fun is over.
