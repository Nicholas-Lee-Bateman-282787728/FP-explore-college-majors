1820427,2,B00007L4NM,"I ENJOYED THIS DVD BUT ON THING I DID NOT LIKE WAS SOME OF THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS USED, I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY DID NOT CUT THAT OUT, I DID NOT THINK THAT RICH LITTLE WOULD BE IN SOMETHING THAT WOULD USE THAT LANGUAGE.",1207526400,3,215,3.8
1820428,4,B00007L4NM,"Rich Little does a great job with all of these impressions.  The only negative is his obvious favoratism towards the Republican presidents especially Reagan. When it came to Clinton...all he focused on was the Monica Lewinsky affair.  How bout some partisanship Rich?  Other than that, this is a very entertaining show.  His LBJ, Nixon, & Reagan are the best!!",1181260800,5,360,5.0508474576271185

7978164,5,B00007L4NM,I love the way Rich Little captured the essence of many of our past presidents.  It's brilliant!  My history professor showed it to the class and I had to have my own copy!,1266105600,2,172,4.181818181818182
7978165,1,B00007L4NM,"thanks to the reviewer who warned about the language.  Otherwise, I might have bought this DVD.  I have heard and used the worst of language over the years but have become disgusted with its use.  It's for people with no descriptive language skills.  I'll shop for something else.  Thanks again.",1244851200,2,295,4.82
7978166,5,B00007L4NM,"Rich Little does a fantastic job of impersonating the presidents except for John Kennedy.  The problem with impersonating Kennedy is that Rich is a bit too old for that role, but the other presidents are done in an excellent fashion.  So, if you forgive him in the Kennedy role, you will be pleased with the other roles.  The Reagan act is probably the best and very convincing.  The Clinton act is probably the funniest.  Now, the best part is [drum roll] the Bonus Material!  Yep.  It is very interesting to see how the act is put together, and the stories by Rich Little himself are jewels.  I found the main act portion a bit dry at times, but the Behind the Scenes held my attention thoroughly.
This DVD is well worth keeping as a historical archive.",1243382400,6,755,4.5
