[Narrator] ""My Little Pony - Escape from Catrina!""

(Exterior shot of Dream Castle; Skydancer and Heart Throb fly into the shot.)

[Narrator] ""Starring Tammy Grimes and Paul Williams!""

(Posey, Lickety-Split, Sundance and Spike are playing with the Sea Ponies by the shore. After a few
seconds, the special's opening theme begins to play, over a montage of the ponies playing together.)

~ My Little Pony, My Little Pony
  How has the world been treating you?
  My Little Pony, My Little Pony
  Have your dreams been coming true?
  Tell me what's doing, anything brewing?
  Is something special in store?
  My Little Pony, My Little Pony
  Can't wait to see you once more ~

(Sand Dollar kicks a ball over to Sundance with her fin; Sundance runs after it.)

[Sundance] I'll do it, I'll do it!

(Sundance walks backwards and collides with Lickety-Split, who was painting a banner with Sparkler, and
accidentally tears the banner in two.)
[Sparkler] You did it alright, Sundance! You ruined our sign!
[Lickety-Split] Now we'll never be ready for the party!
[Sundance] (dejected) I only tried to get the ball.. (sadly kicks the ball forward) Oh no!
[Baby Moondancer] (jumping from rock to rock) You can't splash me, you can't~
(The ball rushes forward, and bumps into Baby Moondancer, knocking her into the water)
[Backstroke] Baby Moondancer!
(Whitecap, Sea Mist and Sand Dollar jump into the water after Baby Moondancer, while the other ponies
watch fearfully. After a few seconds, Baby Moondancer emerges, sitting on top of a giant shell held up
by the Sea Ponies.)
[Sparkler, Starflower, Baby Cotton Candy, Heart Throb and/or Lickety-Split] (cheering) She's alright! Yay! Hooray! (etc)
[Sundance] I'm really sorry, Baby Moondancer. You alright?
[Baby Moondancer] (shakes herself dry) That was fun!
[Sand Dollar] Let's play ball! (kicks ball over to shore with her fin)

(The ball flies towards Spike, knocking him backwards.)
~ What's been occuring? Anything stirring?
  Hope your problems are few ~

(The ball flies into the distance; Baby Moondancer runs after it.)
[Baby Moondancer] I'll get it!

~ My Little Pony, My Little Pony
  May fortune smile on you ~

[Posey?] Come back!

~ May fortune smile on you... ~

(The ball rolls into a dark cave, apparently lost. Baby Moondancer looks down after it; Posey walks up to her.)

[Baby Moondancer] Ball gone, Posey. (she and Posey run back to the others)

~~~

(The ball rolls down the dark, dank cave, eventually rolling into a light clearing, where many Bushwoolies
 are working. It eventually rolls into Rep's leg.)

[Rep] This is no time for games! Get to work, Bushwoolies! (kicks ball into the Witchweed Pool)

(Rep pours a tiny bit of Witchweed Potion into a bowl, then hands the bowl to a purple
 Bushwoolie)

[Rep] Take this to Catrina, and whatever you do, DON'T spill it! There's hardly any left!
[Purple Bushwoolie] Spill it? Nah, I won't spill it, uh-uh..
[Catrina] (filing her claws and purring softly)
[Purple Bushwoolie] Here's your Witchweed Potion, your Queenness.
[Catrina] (purrs)
(The Purple Bushwoolie spills some potion.)
[Catrina] You furbrain! You spilled my precious potion!
  (drinks tiny bit of potion, then grows several feet taller) Get me some more!
(A gust of wind blows from Catrina's mouth, bowling the Purple Bushwoolie over and making him roll back into the clearing.)
[Purple Bushwoolie] (sheepishly) I spilled it.
[Rep] I told ya to be careful! Now she'll get mad at me!
[Purple Bushwoolie] Too bad! We're TIRED of being slaves! We're going to ESCAPE!
[Bushwoolies] Yeah, escape! Escape! Yeah! (etc)
[Catrina] (picks up Purple Bushwoolie) Did you say 'escape'?
[Purple Bushwoolie] (dangling over the Witchweed Pool) Don't drop me, please don't drop me!
[Catrina] I'll show you what happens to Bushwoolies who want to escape!
[Rep] Couldn't they just lose a privilege?
[Bushwoolies] Yeah, a privilige! A privilege! Yeah! (etc)
[Catrina] You have no privileges, you're my /slaves/!
(She drops Purple Bushwoolie into the pool; the Bushwoolies gasp.)
[Rep] No!
(Rep turns into a bird and catches Purple Bushwoolie, dropping him safely by the other Bushwoolies, then shifts back to
 his normal appearance.)
[Catrina] HOW DARE YOU BETRAY ME?! (grabs Rep, then throws him down)
  Bring me some more Witchweed Potion!
[Rep] She's really not so bad once you get to know her better.
[Purple Bushwoolie] We don't wanna know her better!
[Bushwoolies] Yeah, we don't wanna!

~~~

(Heart Throb and Baby Surprise fly up to the top of Dream Castle, fixing a banner that says ""Welcome Back Megan"" to the castle.)
[Powder] Better hurry, Megan'll be here any minute!
(Sundance and Posey are blowing balloons, next to a group of balloons under a net secured to the ground.)
[Baby Moondancer] Can we blow up balloons, Sundance?
[Sundance] No, but you can give me that string over there!
[Baby Moondancer] Okay!
(She grabs the string and accidentally releases the balloons that have already been blown up.)
[Baby Moondancer] Uh-oh.
[Sundance] I'll save 'em!
(Sundance jumps up and tries to catch the net, but fails. She falls, and lands on top of a
 plank of wood that Sparkler and Spike are sitting on, painting another sign. Spike and
 Sparkler fly in the air, and then land roughly, cans of paint landing on top of them.)
[Sundance] Sorry..
[Sparkler] You're so CLUMSY, Sundance!
[Spike] YUCK! Now I have to take a bath..
[Posey] It's Megan and Skydancer!
(Skydancer is floating above Dream Valley, with Megan sitting on her back.)
[Skydancer] Hold tight, Megan! (flies into Dream Valley, to general fanfare)
[Powder] As our guest of honour, we want you to wear this! (bends head; the Rainbow of Light is around her horn.)
[Megan] The Rainbow of Light! (takes locket)
[Sparkler] It looks after us and keeps us safe.
[Megan] (ties locket around neck) Thanks, I'll take good care of it.
(The Baby Ponies surround Megan.)
[Baby Moondancer] I'm Baby Moondancer!
[Baby Surprise] I'm Baby Surprise!
[Baby Glory] I'm Baby Glory!
[Baby Cotton Candy] (giggling) I'm Baby Cotton Candy!
[Megan] (hugs Sundance and Baby Glory) Oh, look at you!
[Baby Moondancer] Will you play with us?
[Baby Surprise] We have nothing to do..
[Posey] Oh yes you do!
(Megan and the Baby Ponies look up.)
[Posey] (canters towards the Lullabye Nursery) If you want to stay up for the costume ball tonight, you need your rest!
(The Baby Ponies also canter towards the Lullabye Nursery)
[Baby Moondancer] But we don't wanna rest!
[Posey] (nudges nursery door open) Into the nursery you go, and no more complaints!
[Baby Moondancer] (mumbling) We never have fun any more..
[Megan] (winks) I'LL take care of them, Posey.

~~~

(Inside the Lullabye Nursery)

[Baby Moondancer] Hey, Megan, we don't wanna take a nap, we wanna /play/!
[Megan] Okay! Let's NOT take a nap!
[Baby Surprise] You really mean it?
[Megan] Sure!

(Aaand we have an insert song! ""Let's Not Take a Nap"")

  ~ Let's not take a nap! Who wants to take a nap?
  Let's let go, let's cut loose
  Be a locomotive and caboose! ~

(Megan and the Baby Ponies imitate a train)

[Baby Ponies] ~ Let's not nap today! Let's stay awake and play~! ~
[Megan] ~ Let's not sleep, let's keep busy
  Play a game of leapfrog, 'til we're dizzy!
  Boing, boing, ~
[Megan and the Baby Ponies] ~ Boing, boing, boing, boing! ~
[Baby Moondancer] ~ Let's do somersaults! ~ (giggles)
[Baby Surprise] ~ Let's do cartwheels! ~
[Megan] ~ Let's stay up until dawn~! ~
[Baby Surprise] ~ Let's have a pillow fight ~
(Baby Moondancer and Baby Surprise have a brief pillow fight, before falling into their cots.)
[Baby Cotton Candy] ~ Then we'll have a tug-of-war..~
(Baby Cotton Candy and Baby Glory tug at a blanket, then fall backwards into *their* cots.)
  (yawns)
[Megan] ~ Goodness me, did someone yawn..? (draws curtains)
  Time we took our naps, before we all collapse.. ~ (tucks the Baby ponies in)
[Baby Moondancer] (sleepily) ~ No it's not.. ~
[Baby Surprise] ~ We're not ready.. ~
[Baby Glory] ~ Glory wants her bottle ~
[Baby Cotton Candy] ~ Where's my teddy..? ~
[Megan] ~ To your beds, douse the light
  And put your sleepy heads down and sleep tight... ~

~~~

(Back at the cave, Catrina is sleeping.)

[Catrina] (purrs)

(The Purple Bushwoolie rolls into the clearing - where the Witchweed Potion is made - and
addresses the other Bushwoolies)
[Purple Bushwoolie] Catrina's asleep! Now's the time to escape!
[Bushwoolies] Escape! Yeah, escape! Escape! (etc)
[Rep] Wait! Let me talk to Catrina. Maybe I can get you shorter hours.
[Bushwoolies] Shorter hours, yeah!
[Purple Bushwoolie] Too late.
[Bushwoolies] Right, too late, too late!
[Rep] H-how about a week off every summer?
[Bushwoolies] (jumping up and down) Yeah, yeah, okay! (etc)
[Purple Bushwoolie] NO! Shut off the Witchweed machine!
(Three Bushwoolies.. shut off the Witchweed machine. :P)
[Rep] What about better food? A window, so you can see out?
[Bushwoolies] Yeah, a window! Good idea!
[Purple Bushwoolie] NO! Bushwoolies unite!
[Bushwoolies] Yeah, unite, unite!!
(The Bushwoolies roll out of the cave through a small hole in the wall as Rep tries to stop them.)
[Rep] Please, don't do this to me!
[Purple Bushwoolie] ESCAPE~!
(The Bushwoolies.. well.. escape. XD)

[Catrina] (wakes up) REP!!
[Rep] Yes?!
[Catrina] Do you hear anything?
[Rep] No..
[Catrina] Neither do I. The Bushwoolies have stopped working.
[Rep] Actually Catrina, that's not exactly true.
[Catrina] Then they're still working?
[Rep] Well.. (quietly) no. They escaped.
[Catrina] ESCAPED?! (grabs Rep) How could they escape, you were guarding them!

(Catrina throws Rep aside and storms off; Rep gets back up and rushes after her. They leave
 the cave, and enter Dream Valley.)

[Catrina] (looking around) Where are they? There's one!
(Rep tries to catch the Bushwoolie, but fails.)
[Catrina] There's another one! (tries to catch it, but grabs a lump of grass instead)
[Rep] They're too fast, we can't catch them.
[Catrina] What am I going to do? (puts arm around Rep, walks forward) Who's going to make
  my precious potion? It's almost gone.
(Suddenly, she notices the Little Ponies, happily playing together and having fun.)
[Posey, Sparkler, Skydancer and Powder] (giggle)
[Catrina] My new slaves..! How shall I trap them?
[Rep] Boy, Catrina, you're growing so cold.
[Catrina] That's it, cold! I'll make a snowstorm!
(Catrina grabs a vial hanging from a string around Rep's neck, and drinks the Witchweed Potion
encased in it; she grows taller again)
[Catrina] Wrah!
(Lasers shoot from Catrina's eyes towards the moon, making the clouds come out)
[Posey] What's happening?
(A strong wind blows..)
[Sparkler] It's getting so cold..
(A gust of wind blows from Catrina's mouth again; it begins to snow.)
[Posey] I'm freezing!
[Skydancer] (weakly) Help..!
(Skydancer begins to fly away, blown by the wind; Powder catches her by the tail. Catrina continues
 to use her wind powers.)
[Rep] That's enough, Catrina!
(She glares at him; meanwhile, the ponies are trapped in a terrible snowstorm, the snow coming up
 to their heads.)
[Posey] I can't move..!
[Sparkler] We're trapped!
[Powder] (pushes through some snow) I think I can get out.. just a little more.. (jumps out) There!
[Sparkler] Get Megan and the Rainbow of Light!
(Powder rushes off; fade to black.)

~~~

(Fade back in; the ponies are still trapped.)

[Posey] Help, help! We can't move!
(Catrina takes some more Witchweed Potion, and blows *another* gust of wind towards the ponies;
 snow falls over them, and they become trapped in a huge ball of snow, rolling every-which-way.
 Meanwhile, Megan, Powder and Sundance rush over.)
[Powder?] We're coming!
[Megan] And I've got the Rainbow!
(Catrina blows yet *another* gust of wind - but this time, the snowball moves towards her.)
[Megan] (opens locket) Okay Rainbow, do your stuff!
(The Rainbow of Light flies out from the locket, past Catrina and Rep, and into the clouds,
 releasing the sunlight and melting the snow.)
[Powder] It's working!
[Megan] The sun is coming out!
[Rep] It's melting the snow!
[Catrina] Not for long..
(Catrina shoots bolts of lightning from her eyes, towards the Rainbow; however, the Rainbow
continues to push the dark clouds in the sky away from the sun. Sparkler, Posey and Skydancer
emerge from the snow.)
[Megan] Be careful, Rainbow..
(Bolts of lightning continue to target the Rainbow.)
  Look out!
(However, the Rainbow is victorious! The dark clouds gone, it flies back into the locket.)
[Posey] The Rainbow saved us!
[Sparkler?] It protected us again!
[Megan] (closes locket) Good work, Rainbow.

(Catrina shrinks back to normal size.)
[Rep] I guess you'll have to find some other slaves.
[Catrina] No. I want those Little Ponies.
[Rep] But how do we get past the Rainbow?
[Catrina] We'll get the Rainbow first, /then/ the Little Ponies.
[Rep] Can't we just leave the Little Ponies alone?
[Catrina] No! I need them to make my Witchweed Potion!
[Rep] (walks away) Catrina.. suppose you didn't have the Witchweed Potion any more?
[Catrina] (grabs Rep, pulls him back to her) Why wouldn't I want the Potion? It makes me powerful!
[Rep] To tell you the truth, I liked you better before you were powerful.
[Catrina] I like being powerful!
[Rep] But we used to have fun together! We laughed and played.. What happened to the good old days?

(Cue another insert song - the villain song, ""Good (Before You Turned Bad) Old Days"". Like
 the Moochick's song from the first special, this was cut in the edited-for-time version, and is
 therefore somewhat hard to find. D: Anyways, it plays over a montage of the good times Rep
 and Catrina used to share, mostly. Aww.)

[Rep] ~ There used to be a time
  Or maybe you've forgotten
  When you weren't mean and rotten
  Remember, those good-before-you-turned-bad old days? ~
[Catrina] ~ Don't hand me that line,
  I've heard enough!
  I like to play rough, and if you don't, that's tough! ~
[Rep] ~ Oh, how I long to see
  The sweetie puss you used to be
  The cute and cuddly kitten
  (laughs) Sittin' on my knee~ ~
[Catrina] ~ That girl is gone, good riddance to her!
  Take my advice, (drinks Witchweed Potion) forget you knew her!
  Because now I'm in my prime
  The pinnacle of my power
  And soon I'll make the whole world cower! ~
[Rep] ""And the sweet pussycat I knew..?""
[Catrina] ~ She made like a windstorm and..
(Catrina blows a gust of wind, blowing Rep out of his fantasies and into reality.)
  She's gone, like those good- ~
[Rep] ~ Before you turned bad ~
[Both] ~ Old days~! ~

(Catrina grabs Rep's vial of Witchweed Potion again, trying to drink some more, but it's empty. She
 throws him onto the ground.)
[Catrina] Now look what you've done! I'm out of Witchweed Potion!
[Rep] (wiggles eyebrows happily) I won't tell anybody.

~~~

(Back at Dream Valley, Megan, Spike and the Little Ponies are gathered at the Dream Castle.)

[Megan] Dream Castle's so beautiful!
[Posey] All that's left to do is hang these balloons.
[Sundance] (steps forward) I'll help!
[Sparkler] No thanks, Sundance. You've done enough already!
[Sundance] (sadly) Oh.. (walks away)
[Megan] What'd she do wrong?
[Sparkler] EVERYTHING!
[Posey] Sundance is a very good jumper.. it's landing she's not so good at.

(Sundance is sitting by the river, sobbing to herself. Megan walks up to her and puts her arm
 around Sundance.)
[Megan] Don't cry, Sundance. Everyone goes through a clumsy stage, even I did.
[Sundance] (crying) I've always been clumsy.
[Megan] But you're a great jumper, right?
[Sundance] I can jump farther than any other Little Pony..
[Megan] Well, that's wonderful. Think of all the things you can do that others can't!
  (walks over to an apple tree) Now, if I wanted that big juicy apple..
  (jumps up, trying to grab it, but fails) I can't reach it!
[Sundance] (walks up to the tree) I can! (jumps up and grabs the apple with her mouth.)
[Megan] See? Great jump! (takes apple) And you didn't crash or anything!
[Sundance] Maybe I was just lucky.
[Megan] You're not lucky. You're special!
[Sundance] (happily) Gee, maybe you're right. (smiles)
[Megan] Maybe? (walks away) Come on..
[Sundance] (walks after Megan) I can also get to the party faster than you can! Wanna ride?
[Megan] (hugs Sundance) Sure!
(Megan climbs on Sundance's back, and they ride off back to Dream Castle.)

~~~

(Night has fallen. At the Lullabye Nursery, the Baby Ponies crowd around the mirror, trying to
 look at their costumes. Baby Glory is wearing ""Prima Ballerina"", Baby Cotton Candy is wearing
 ""Sunday Stroll"", and Baby Surprise is wearing ""Ready for Rainbows"".)
[Baby Glory] My turn! Let me look!
[Baby Cotton Candy] (pushes her out of the way) You just looked, it's my turn now!
[Baby Surprise] (jumps up and down behind them) No, I wanna see!
[Megan] (walks over to the Baby Ponies) Come on, Baby Ponies, time for the party!
[Baby Glory, Baby Cotton Candy and Baby Surprise] (rush over to the door) Hooray! Yippie!!
  Party, party!
(Meanwhile, Baby Moondancer is sitting in a corner, her head bowed. Megan walks over to her.)
[Megan] Baby Moondancer, where's your costume?
[Baby Moondancer] Don't have one.
[Megan] Well, why not?
[Baby Moondancer] Don't have anything to wear.
[Megan] Well, let's see what we can do about that.
(Megan sees a crown sitting on top of a shelf; she picks it up and puts it on Baby Moondancer's head.)
  There! You can go as a princess!
(Baby Moondancer smiles, then her face falls again.)
[Baby Moondancer] (sadly) Need a gown..
[Megan] A gown.. let's see..
(She finds a red cape with white trimming, and wraps it around Baby Moondancer)
  How's that?
[Baby Moondancer] (in awe) Pretty..
[Megan] One more thing.
(Megan unfastens the locket around her neck; unfortunately, Rep is standing outside, watching
them through the window)
[Baby Moondancer] (amazed) Gee, the Rainbow locket..!
(Megan puts the locket around Baby Moondancer's neck.)
[Megan] Perfect!
[Baby Moondancer] (kisses Megan's forehead) Thank you, Megan!
[Megan] (kisses Baby Moondancer's forehead) Now go to the party, I'll be there as soon as I've
  put on my costume.
(Rep backs away from the window, looks around to make sure no one's watching him, then shapeshifts
into a Little Pony, complete with nurse hat. He then walks away, on his hind legs.)

~~~

(Baby Moondancer walks through Dream Valley happily)

[Rep] (in a sort of high-pitched, girly voice) Hello there, princess!
[Baby Moondancer] (warily) Who're you?
[Rep] (still talking in a girly voice) I'm going to the costume ball too! My, what a pretty locket! Can I see it?
[Baby Moondancer] Why?
[Rep] (continues to fake a 'girly' voice) Er.. I-I'm a nurse! I have to examine it.
[Baby Moondancer] No! (backs away)
[Rep] (shifts back to normal form) Gimme that locket!
(He grabs the locket, but Baby Moondancer pulls away.)
[Baby Moondancer] NO!
[Rep] (pulling on her cape) Give it to me..
[Baby Moondancer] (kicks Rep in the foot) No!! (walks away)
(Rep jumps up and down in pain, holding his foot.. and then accidentally steps on his tail.)
[Rep] That hurt.
(Catrina walks into view.)
  Catrina!
(Baby Moondancer looks back at Catrina, scared)
[Catrina] I'll take that locket!
[Baby Moondancer] Help!
(Catrina tries to take the locket, but Baby Moondancer bites her finger. She screams loudly;
 Baby Moondancer tries to escape, but Catrina steps on her cape, preventing her from running
 away.)
[Catrina] I'll take the locket and you!
[Baby Moondancer] (terrified) No!
[Catrina] (picks up Baby Moondancer) Give us a ride, Rep!
(Rep shapeshifts into a dragon; Catrina sits on his back. He struggles to fly away, unable to
 support her weight.)
[Baby Moondancer] Help! Help!!
[Megan] Baby Moondancer!
[Catrina] (to Rep) Take off!
[Rep] (still struggling) You're.. too heavy..
[Catrina] HURRY!
(Megan runs over, just as Rep finally manages to fly away. She jumps up and down, trying to
 grab them.)
[Baby Moondancer] Help, Megan! Help me! Help!!

~~~

(Later on that night, the moon is out, and it's pitch black. The Little Ponies are searching
 for Baby Moondancer.)
[?] Where are they?
[?] What if we can't find them?
[Megan] They'd better not hurt Baby Moondancer.
(The Bushwoolies laugh off-screen. Megan and the ponies look through some bushes; the Bushwoolies
 are gathered round a campfire.)
[Megan] Who are you?
[Bushwoolies] (happily) We're Bushwoolies!
[Purple Bushwoolie] What d'ya think?
[Yellow Bushwoolie] How do we look?
[Another yellow Bushwoolie] Do you like us?
[Sundance] I think they're cute!
[Bushwoolies] (laughing) Cute, yeah! Cute! (etc)
[Purple Bushwoolie] Simmer down, Bushwoolies!
(The Bushwoolies stop talking)
  (quietly) You aren't looking for a large cat by any chance, are you?
[Megan] Yes we are! And a funny looking creature who can change into other things!
[Purple Bushwoolie] Catrina and Rep! They went down that hole over there!
(The purple Bushwoolie points to the entrance to Catrina's cave, a few feet away.)
[Bushwoolies] Yeah, over there! Down the hole! Yeah!
[Megan] What's down there?
[Purple Bushwoolie] That used to be our home, 'til Catrina made us her slaves!
[Megan] We've gotta get down there and save Baby Moondancer!
[Posey] And the Rainbow of Light!
[Purple Bushwoolie] (jumps into the hole) Follow me!
(Megan, the Little Ponies and the other Bushwoolies jump after him, sliding down the hole.
 They fall into Catrina's cave, near the Witchweed machine.)
[Megan] Oh no!
(Catrina is holding Baby Moondancer above the Witchweed pool, the Rainbow of Light in one hand.)
[Catrina] I want you to be my slaves!
[Sparkler, Posey, Skydancer, Sundance and Powder] NO!
[Catrina] If I spare the rainbow, will you be my slaves~?
[Sparkler, Posey, Skydancer, Sundance and Powder] NO!
[Catrina] Then say goodbye to Baby Moondancer! (holds her a bit closer to the Witchweed pool)
[Rep] Catrina! (pulls her arm away) Wait! That's goin' too far!
(Catrina snarls, then screams and throws Rep into a pile of golden objects nearby. He shapeshifts
 into a bull, pushing the objects off him and pawing at the ground angrily.)
  You asked for it, Catrina..
(Rep charges at Catrina, pushing the Rainbow and Baby Moondancer out of her hands, and pushing
 Catrina herself into the Witchweed pool. She clings to the edge, screaming. The Rainbow of Light
 flies perilously close to the pool, but Megan catches it. Sundance jumps over the pool and flies
 under Baby Moondancer, catching her, then lands on the other side of the pool.)
[Sundance] I did it, Megan!
[Megan] (happily) You sure did, Sundance!
(Catrina continues to yell for help; Rep shifts back into his normal form. Catrina is slowly
 sliding down the walls of the Witchweed potion, clinging on desperately with her claws.)
[Catrina] Help, Rep! Help me!
[Rep] Uh, I dunno, Catrina. If only you could change a-and be good again!
[Catrina] I can change! I can be really good! (slides down a bit further)
[Megan] How do we know?
[Catrina] I-I'll prove it! Just help me! (slides down even further)
[Rep] (quietly) Okay. (louder) Okay, if you destroy the Witchweed machine!
[Catrina] But that took forever to build! Can't you think of something else?
  (slides further down) Wait! I'll do it! But I need some more potion. I'm out of power!
(Rep looks at Catrina for a minute, then runs over to the machine. He pours a tiny drop of
 Witchweed Potion into a bowl, then walks back to the Witchweed pool.)
[Rep] Here it comes, Catrina! (overturns bowl)
(Catrina catches the drop of potion, and grows taller again.)
  (backs away) The machine, Catrina! Remember what you said!
(Catrina looks around, then shoots lasers out of her eyes at the machine, blowing it into
 tiny pieces. Megan, the ponies and the Bushwoolies cheer; Catrina returns to her normal size.)
[Catrina] (holds hand out to Rep) Would you please help me out now?

(Back at the Dream Castle, the costume ball is starting. Spike walks to the top of some stairs,
 dressed as a knight; he begins to play the trumpet, until the visor of his helmet falls down over
 his eyes. Megan is sitting in a throne, wearing a pretty white dress.)
[Megan] (giggles) Let the parade of costumes begin!

(Another insert song! The rather catchy ""Dressed Like A Dream"". The Sea Ponies are swimming in a
 fountain during this song, btw.)

  Dressed like a dream (dressed like a dream)
  Like stars that shine and gleam (that shine and gleam)

 walks over and smooches Spike on the cheek.)
  they're lighting up the whole galaxy! ~
(Backstroke splashes water at Baby Surprise)

[Whitecap and Sea Mist] Isn't it fun getting all done up?
(Sundance and a pink earth pony walk down the steps. Sundance is dressed in the outfit
 ""Pageant Queen""; the earth pony is wearing ""Sweetness and Lace"".)
  Pretending you're someone new-e-ew!
(Posey and Lickety-Split walk by the Sea Ponies' fountain; Posey is wearing ""Pony Luv"",
 Lickety-Split is wearing ""Party Time"".)
  Life is supreme when you're dressed like a

(Interlude; Rep and Catrina walk to the stairs, Rep leading Catrina. Catrina is wearing a
 pretty pink dress, her hair in a bun; Rep is wearing a tuxedo and top hat.)
[Rep] You look beautiful, Catrina.
[Catrina] Do you really think so, darling?
[Rep] Just like the good old days!
(They reach the top of the stairs; a spotlight hits Catrina, and he pushes her forward.)
  (quietly) Go on, Catrina! Your public awaits!
[Catrina] (to Rep, quietly) I'd be happy to, Rep, dear, but you're standing on my dress!
[Rep] (quietly, embarrassed) Excuse me.
(Rep moves his foot; he and Catrina walk down the stairs.)

[Megan] ~ Isn't it fun getting all done up?
(Heart Throb walks down the stairs, wearing the wedding outfit ""Something Old, Something New"".
 Two bushwoolies are walking behind her, holding up her veil.)

7809600,5,6301132742,"This was my absolute favorite video when I was little. Everytime we'd visit the video store, this is the movie that I would choose to rent. Now, as a college kid, I still love this video!

It's a little lovey-dovey, but it's a great movie. I hope to be a teacher someday, and want to show it to my students, too!

The ponies are really cute (my favorite one is the jumper pony; the one who can reach the apples from the tall tree for Megan). It has a happy ending, too! It's a darling video; very worthwhile!",1095120000,,508,4.173469387755102
7809601,4,6301132742,"Hey everyone!!  Lauren here. How is everyone doing?  Good I hope. I just wanted to let everyone know that this movie is very funny and cute.  It stars my favorite pony of all.  Fizzy!  I love her so much!!

It all starts when Fizzy, a sweet, easy-going unicorn, Gusty, a spunky, but loud unicorn, Wind Whistler, a smart Pegasus and Shady, a shy earth pony are playing polo.  In the middle of the game, the ponies lose their ball when Fizzy tries to grab it with a bubble, using her unicorn magic.  The ball rolls down a hole into what Wind Whistler tells her friends is called the Mistificent forest.  The forest is home to little gnome like creatures called dell dwellers.  According to Wind Whistler they are the creatures responsible for making things, such as the stones, Danny, Megan's younger brother, likes to skip on the lake whenever he and his sisters come to visit, which is very often.  Once the little ponies get down to the forests floor, they meet the dell dwellers, who are hard at work.

 As the little ponies are going to get their ball back, Shady accidentally knocks over a barrel labeled balance and it topples over, ,unleashing frazits, little different colored balls.  In doing this, the frazits mix up the ponies personalities. Fizzy is suddenly talking like Wind Whistler, Wind Whistler can't stop giggling and Shady is being unusually bold, while Gusty is hiding in a corner, not wanting to come out!

 It's all up to Fizzy and she rises to the challenge with the help of Gusty and Shady.  Fizzy ends up saving everyone and restoring the natural balance of things.  Once the barrel is turned right side up again, everything is the way it used to be and all the little ponies are back to normal.

I like this movie because it lets Fizzy shine and it shows that she has a big heart and is willing to do anything to help her friends.  I've always known that to be true about her and that's the reason I love her so much.  She will always have a special place in my heart.  This episode of MLP isn't one of my ultimate favorite ones, but it's certainly up there with ""The Magic Coins"", ""The Ghost of Paradise Estate"", ""The Return of Tambelon"", ""Fugitive Flowers"", ""MLP: The Movie"", ""Firefly's Adventure"", ""The Quest for the Golden Horseshoes"" and ""Through the Door"".  It's a must have for anyone who loves ""My Little Pony"" and is in need of a good laugh.",1093219200,2,2376,4.525821596244131
7809602,5,6301132742,"This is the second ""My Little Pony"" special. It's one of the best ever made. The Little Ponies are having a costume ball in honor of their human friend, Megan. Throughout preparation, we see Catrina, an evil cat-like creature, who uses Witchweed Potion to be powerful. The potion is made by the Bushwoolies. But they soon escape and Catrina wants the Little Ponies as her new slaves.
PROS:
The songs are really great, and Catrina isn't wishy-washy like some of the villians on the MLP 'n Friends TV series (ie the Witches from the Volcano of Gloom). This is also one of the best plot-lines for an MLP cartoon.
CONS:
I didn't like the way Megan was animated, and the ponies from the first special never returned (and in my opinion, Firefly should have returned.
Also, whoever designed the initial box when this came to video obviously wasn't paying attention to the program. On the front cover, ponies and characters who aren't even in this special are pictured, and the back states that Baby Surprise is kidnapped by Catrina, but  it's Baby Moondancer who gets kidnapped.
All in all, this is one of the best MLP cartoons ever made.",1086220800,4,1131,4.683417085427136
7809603,4,6301132742,"This is a great old my little pony movie.  I haven't seen it for a few years, because the only person I knew who owned a copy was my cousin, and she lost her's.  I remember that I quite liked it.  There was a pig-like villain who was very vain, and with her two goofy accomplisses enslaved the ponies before turning the rest of them and their home into glass.  I wish this was made more easily available!",1050364800,5,404,4.141025641025641
