8321007,4,B001MBTT9E,"Freshman Psych is a cool cult-like indie. I heard this was a franchise.  Sophomore Psych, Junior Psych, then Senior Psych to follow. Wonder if that's true.  Anyway wish they would remake it with a bigger budget -- great story.",1351123200,,226,4.769230769230769
8321008,4,B001MBTT9E,"As you might guess, Freshman Psych is a rather complicated psychological exploration of madness and violence.  The notion of group therapy leading to group suicide right there in the therapy room's circle of chairs intrigued me,  but the movie's inexorably slow start had me thinking early on that this was just another bad, low-budget movie.  Fortunately, things began to turn around at the mid-way point, as the true identities of the proverbial good and bad guys came into increasing question.  Freshman Psych has its share of problems, but overall it's a pretty decent attempt at telling a slightly surreal, out of the ordinary story that dares to make you think.

Apparently, at this particular (unnamed) college, a student can get failing grades expunged from his/her record by spending twenty-four hours under psychiatric evaluation.  One fellow, Sam (Christopher Duncan) is capitalizing on this loophole by transporting students in need to a local institution and helping them get admitted.  Unfortunately, one group of students committed suicide in the group therapy room - but that has done surprisingly little to hurt business.  In fact, it has helped it by convincing Mason (Russell Fenton) and his girlfriend Lolly (the beautiful Kelsey Martin) to hop on the crazy house express.  Mason's former girlfriend was one of the suicide victims, and he is determined to find and stop whoever was responsible for her death.  Lolly primarily goes in order to prove Mason wrong, but his suspicions would seem to be confirmed somewhat upon the group's arrival at what is basically an abandoned, maze-like building.  That's when the real mind games start.  Is Sam or someone hiding in the shadows the actual source of evil?  Is Mason just paranoid and insane?  Could Mason actually be responsible for the deaths himself?  Is Lolly truly innocent in all of this?  Flashbacks and camcorder videos of past and present events, sometimes presented in two different versions, help keep the waters of clarity muddied throughout.

I've tried not to label the bad guy a killer because he doesn't actually kill anybody himself.  What he does, by way of various means of psychological scare tactics, drugs, and whatnot, is to somehow get his victims to kill themselves and possibly each other.  Thus, we are not talking about a slasher film here; no one's going to jump out with a machete and start hacking people to pieces.  The film has its problems (why, for example, don't these people try to leave the same way they came in, and why don't they ever try breaking a window or busting down a door to try and get out?), and even the complicated nature of the script isn't substantial enough to cover some of the plot holes, but Freshman Psych offers a different kind of horror movie experience and kept me wondering who was really whom up until the very end.  Given its estimated budget of twenty grand, that's saying something.",1312588800,,2919,4.977319587628866
8321009,5,B001MBTT9E,"SPOILERS: Here we have a tale of 2 people. Which one is the villain and which one is the hero? Who do you believe? That is the question Freshman Psych asks you. Russel Fenton plays Mason who was a victim of a terrible tragedy, an experiment that went horribly wrong costing him the woman he loved. Christopher Duncan plays Sam who was the person who may have caused the tragedy or did he? Mason is back to stop Sam from hurting more people or is he here to hurt these self same people? The questions are buried in the story and you have to find them. Splendidly written and directed the film keeps you guessing until the final reel.",1292198400,,632,4.319327731092437
