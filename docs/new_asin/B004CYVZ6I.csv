4330665,5,B004CYVZ6I,"Shape 400-Calorie Fat Blast caught me off guard...I wasn't prepared for the intensity of the 3 workouts. Keri Crockett is the instructor. Summer Sanders (Keri's sister-in-law) does a lot of talking throughout and shows modifications to make it less intense. If you have knee issues, you probably want to steer clear of this. There are a lot of squats, lunges and jumps. Keri Crockett was a professional skier and it shows =)

There are 3 workouts on this dvd. Each workout is around 25 minutes (including warmup & cooldown). You will need a set of weights, I used 5 lbs, and a mat. The warm up is around 4 minutes, and it gets your heart pumping. I'll do my best to breakdown the workouts =)

1. JUMPSTART CARDIO - One minute cardio intervals with resistance training sets.

Push ups

 *REPEAT, building up to 5 push ups*

Shoulder raises - raise front, open side, down...then bring up from side, bring front, down
Rear Delt Flys
Back Rows
Shoulder Press

Frog Leaps forward and back
Good Mornings

2. CALORIE BURNING INFERNO - 3 minutes cardio alternating with strength - your legs will be fried!

*there is a 15 second recovery after each minute of cardio*
Low Squats
Jump Lunge
High Knees

Side Plank pulses
repeat opposite side

Squat Kicks Forward
Squat Kicks Side
Triple Kick Side (3 pulse kicks)
repeat

Because I hadn't heard anything about this workout, I assumed that it wouldn't be very challenging. Lesson learned!  Even though the workouts are only 25 minutes, they really pack a punch. This DVD is great for intermediate level exercisers and up. You can definately increase the weight when needed.

This is a great full body workout! I highly recommend this workout =)",1302566400,49,2664,4.731019522776573
4330666,5,B004CYVZ6I,"This is an excellent video that yields real results! I do the video just twice a week. At first, my legs were absolutely burning and I thought I would not be able to finish the sets. But you CAN hang in there mentally, and accomplish what you set out to do and the results prove it's worth it! Now I feel like something is missing if I don't do the workout my usual 2-times weekly. It makes you sore in a great way so you know it's working your trouble zones. My legs and butt have never been so toned, and my arms which have always been my trouble zone are ripped after three weeks of doing the workout just twice a week. Even if I don't get any other gym-time in some weeks, doing this video is enough to keep my body in great shape! This is an excellent video to push through your workout plateaus and see fast results. A great buy.",1301356800,20,835,4.097560975609756
4330667,5,B004CYVZ6I,This video is fantastic. Your heart rate will be through the roof. I was pouring (and I do mean pouring) sweat after the warm up and cardio workout. Great bang for the buck!,1360713600,,173,4.2727272727272725
4330668,4,B004CYVZ6I,"I bought this DVD based on other reviews in Amazon. There are 3 short workouts. If you really want to burn calories, I recommend you do all 3, it will take you about one hour.

The routines are good, but the instructors are really boring. When they talk it seems as if they were reading from a prompt. That is why I am giving this 4 instead of 5.",1359936000,2,346,4.0144927536231885

4330670,5,B004CYVZ6I,I really like this video.  The workouts will really make you sweat.  Be sure to have a water bottle handy!  Summer Sanders and the other instructor are great--not annoying at all like some instructors.  I am going to look into buying some different videos in this line.,1354147200,,269,4.659574468085107
4330671,5,B004CYVZ6I,"This is one of my favorite videos, and I have a lot of them. The cover says its a 15 minute workout, but with the warm up and cool down included its probably about 25 minutes.

4330672,5,B004CYVZ6I,I really enjoy this DVD. It is challenging and fun. I have several work out DVDs and this is the one I use the most. They have modifications that you can do if you are beginner. If you are looking for a way to challenge yourself I recommend this DVD!,1353369600,,250,4.02
4330673,4,B004CYVZ6I,"Great exercise for people who are already in quite good shape. A clever combination of cardio and weight training to get best results. Only one down side, too many squat based exercises in the cardio session- which might not be great if you have bad knees.",1341964800,5,256,4.586956521739131
4330674,3,B004CYVZ6I,"I consider myself at an intermediate level when it comes to fitness. I work out 5-6 days a week at fairly high intensity mixing it up with power yoga, strength training, and cardio. I purchased this video because I was looking for a more dynamic switch in cardio routine and something that would be quick and effective. This is a VERY challenging video. I tried very hard to get into this and work it into my regular work out routine but honestly I just get bored with it. While I am sure that these routines are highly effective, I don't find them fun or interesting and it gets repetitious. I can't get that into Summer Sanders even though she has a good personality and I like that she shows that she is getting out of the breath and is doing all the exercises with you. This is a powerful workout routine but just not one of the most fun, inspiring, or creative routines out there. Not the workout video for me, I'm sure I'll pull this out every few months when I really need something new but I won't turn to this on a weekly basis.",1336262400,11,1037,4.295918367346939
4330675,5,B004CYVZ6I,"This is a great workout. I own several DVD's for working out at home and was recently thinking about purchasing a high intensity workout program such as Insanity or P90X. Then I bought this DVD. This is definitely the hardest workout in my collection. The cardio moves are intense and really get your heart pumping and I LOVE the way weights are incorporated. Lower intensity options are given for beginners or those with bad joints and the two women in the DVD are very motivating without being annoying. Summer Sanders is actually very funny in the DVD. It makes the workout go by in a flash because you are having so much fun! This workout makes me sweat harder than any other workout I do. When I am done I feel like I jumped into a pool I am so drenched. Sometimes I can feel the sweat just dripping off of me by the end of the DVD. I really recommend this workout. It is also very kind to my knees, which are touchy thanks to my many years of being an aerobics instuctor in the 90's. I would like to see more of these DVD's with these two women. Just awesome. I highly recommend to everyone out there looking for a good workout!!!!",1334275200,5,1137,4.317757009345795
4330676,5,B004CYVZ6I,"This workout has good instruction and is suitable for beginner to intermediate exercisers. I found the hosts easy to follow and helpful and thought the workout was good. I do all three segments together for a workout that's about 50 minutes. And there's a play all, and the ability to mix and match the segments. There's also an Ab workout available online. I wish they had put that on the DVD as it's well executed.

It's a mix of cardio and resistance exercises, nothing new or fancy, but well cued and useful.",1334016000,2,512,4.565217391304348
4330677,5,B004CYVZ6I,"What I like best about this video is that these two are not your usual annoying bubble-headed aerobic instructors. They are down-to-earth athletes doing ""Training Style"" moves, not gym rats shaking their tiny booties. It's also a killer workout! It's been years since I haven't been able to make it through a whole workout video (and yes, I've done P90X). But this had me panting and sweating from the get-go. Had to modify halfway through and plum gave up by the end! Very high impact and high cardio. More like an 800 calorie fat blast to me! Love it!",1333929600,3,553,4.595959595959596
4330678,5,B004CYVZ6I,"I totally under-estimated this by the cover also the fact that it is produced by Shape.
All the Shape workout DVD is really for beginners no matter what they say.
Not this one. it is better than any Jillian's workout for sure.",1329004800,5,226,4.404761904761905
4330679,5,B004CYVZ6I,"I have a large collection of exercise dvd's. I workout most to Jillian Michaels, Jari Love, Amy Dixon and Jackie Warner. I workout at an advanced level with both high impact cardio and weights. I was not sure how I would like this workout but I really enjoy it. I do the entire workout and it is a good well rounded workout. I am glad I bought it and am finding that I like to add it into my usual rotation.",1327881600,3,407,4.037037037037037
4330680,5,B004CYVZ6I,"I love this dvd. There are three, just under 20 minute workouts. It is pretty hard to convince myself that I don't have time for a 20 minute work out! That is the first thing I love about this dvd.

Secondly, Summer Sanders (and her sister-in-law who instruct the workouts), do the whole work out with you and encourage you the whole way. Unlike Jillian Micheals, who tries to inspire you by talking about bikini or jeans shopping... UGH! That is the LAST thing I want to think about when I'm busting my ass! Anyway, I really like their supportive way of encouraging through the workout, it's more focused on challenging yourself and building strength than on vanity.

Third, circuit training is so very effective for getting in shape and firming up. You will pay a lot of money for a personal trainer to teach you these same moves and techniques in the gym.

Finally, whether you are advanced or new to this type of work out, this dvd is great. They show you how to modify all of the moves from beginner, to intermediate, to the advanced version. SUCH a great buy!",1327622400,7,1065,4.507772020725389
4330681,5,B004CYVZ6I,This workout includes three 15min segments.  I thought it pushed me harder than the half marathon I just ran! The exercises are easy to follow and very athletic...not fancy.  It is a great video to add to your collection for these long winter months.,1322956800,,250,4.659090909090909
4330682,5,B004CYVZ6I,"First, I'm not a guy. I'm on my boyfriend's account.
This DVD is irreplaceable. I have always been avid about staying in shape... Hitting the gym at least 4 days a week and doing anaerobic cardio on the other days. I'm 21 years old, 5'5 and 120 lbs. I also lift a lot of weights. I say all this to prove to you all that I am no beginner. Anyway, I've just got into this workout DVD phase. This was one of the first ones I purchased. Long story short, goodness joe, I thought I might pass out. Granted, I did do ALL 3 workouts together. However, I did not think I would be able to even finish the first 15 minute segment without vomitting. As my body was screaming ""STOOOOOP"" my mind somehow kept me going. And I finished it. Wow. So I ordered more DVDs... Jillian Michaels, Jackie Warner, all the top knotch trainers. I figured, hey if this DVD with 2 reviews is so awesome, I can't wait to try the big names! I've found a couple that I like (Jackie's Xtreme Timesaver and Jillian's Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism) but have YET to find one as awesome as this one. I keep coming back, two or three times a week. It gets my heart rate up and I burn SOOOO many calories with this and the other two I mentioned. This one is still the best though!
PS you'll LOVE Keri & Summer. They're so cute.",1320537600,11,1287,4.172690763052209

These two ladies make the best out of 15 min workouts! The first time I did it, I completed the whole dvd,  but not without stopping :s And I was drenched in sweat. Those burpess are killer.
Today I modified and just did two of the workouts and I was still drenched! I'm very please with this dvd.",1320451200,2,438,4.214285714285714
4330684,5,B004CYVZ6I,Great workout! I have been looking to change up my routine after my treadmill broke-had been running 5 miles a day 5 days a week. I think this dvd (and a few of the others I have bought) have been a great addition to my exercise rotation. I was afraid the dvd's wouldn't work me as hard as the runs but I was more than pleasantly surprised at how hard the workout was!,1320019200,2,368,4.054794520547945
4330685,5,B004CYVZ6I,I have been working out every day with various videos and I bought this one because I was looking for a new challenge. Boy did I get one! I really like the format of the Shape videos! I have to say this kicked my now much firmer butt! Summer and Carrie are great motivators and aren't annoying like some trainers. I would definitely recommend this video!,1316131200,3,354,4.378787878787879
4330686,5,B004CYVZ6I,"This is the BEST Cardio DVD I have ever purchased. I am avid exercise enthusist (road bike, x-country ski, yoga, kayak, pilates, lift weights, etc.). I have been in search of a focused 1 hour intense workout for a long time. This video is PERFECT. I feel the workout and the results. Easy to follow and not all these tricky dance steps. Please, Please make another video incorporating the BOSU ball. All current DVD's for BOSU ball are boring and too tricky (many opportunities of twisting your ankle). I have recommended this DVD to many of my workout friends, and they love it too!! Keep up the great work!!",1316044800,3,609,4.5963302752293576
4330687,5,B004CYVZ6I,"I love the versatility of this DVD. With only 3 workouts, you wouldn't think that you'd have so many options--but you do. The workouts all use weights, so it's easy to gradually increase and therefore use the DVD for a long time, improving along the way. Each routine also includes cardio, which is great but less boredom-friendly (especially since the warm-up and cool-down is the same for each of the 3 routines). Still, this DVD is guaranteed to make you sweat and work hard, and the hosts are friendly enough to be motivating without getting annoying--overall I'm vert glad I bought it!",1313884800,2,590,4.794117647058823
4330688,5,B004CYVZ6I,"When I ordered this video, there were only a few reviews, but all of them were really good reviews.  And I must say that I agree with everyone else.  This was an incredible workout!  I am a fairly active person who works out on a regular basis and I've done all the videos you can think of - P90X, Insanity, Jillian Michaels and Jackie Warner.  This was right up there with all of the others.  It is very lower body intensive - lots of squats, jumps, lunges, kicks, etc.  I didn't mind this because that is where my trouble spots are.  However, I could barely walk for three days after doing the video the first time - and I'm not exaggerating.  I just did it for the second time and the workout was just as intense.  It is nice because they show you some modifications in case you have any injuries or are just not quite ready for the high intensity reps.  But I love it and highly recommend it!",1313107200,6,896,4.2176470588235295
4330689,5,B004CYVZ6I,"This is most certainly not for the beginner.  I would consider myself a pretty active person; I run, do a variety of exercise videos, play sports and this one almost kicked my butt.  I think this is the perfect dvd to get me beach ready in no time.",1310688000,2,248,4.145833333333333
4330690,5,B004CYVZ6I,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.

Pros:  Instructors are likeable, low-key, and motivating but not overly peppy.  Good cuing --- Keri has a good voice for this kind of thing and does not get shrieky as the going gets tough.  Love the moves selected, circuit format with weights, and high intensity.  Love the longer cardio and shorter core focus.  Love the segment breakdown that you can do separately or together.  Very high production values.  Music is great --- audible but not distracting, modern, steady beat to follow.  Camera work is great --- no weird pans or dizzy focusing, frames what you need to see when you need to see it, no annoying body zooms.  Most importantly, overall, I worked up a serious sweat and, according to my heart rate monitor, burned more calories than the title promises.

Cons:  Having, essentially, two instructors was distracting for me and while it is not a deal breaker, it would not be something I consider a pro.  That said, in this case especially, the con is rather offset by the fact that you can see they clearly enjoyed working with each other.  The one thing this DVD lacks is a music and cues only option which I want on every workout DVD since I use them over and over and would prefer to be able to cut down to essentials.

As my stamina improves, I find it harder and harder to find workouts that keep me in my heart rate zone and requires no creative modification on my part.  This has quickly become my favorite DVD.  Would really love to see more tough workouts like this from Keri.",1308355200,4,1556,4.55956678700361

4330692,5,B004CYVZ6I,"First, my husband's name is the name on this account we share. So it isn't him reviewing this. I am Nicole. :-)

I had my baby in beginning of February. This came out around a month after I had him. I pre-ordered it so it arrived on March 1st. I waited until mid-March to start it. I LOVE it. I started out wearing a size 6 still from leftover baby weight. I now fit back into a size 2! I have 7 pounds left to lose and my son is only 3 months old! I do mix it up with elliptical days and this dvd.

They are super fun instructors. I used her prenatal workout as well, so I knew that I liked their attitudes. Easy to understand, but not an easy workout! I have been an avid fitness freak for many years and this gets me sweaty! I used muscles I hadn't used in a while and I loved it. If you are looking for a tough, fun, result getting DVD then this is most definitely it.

The bonus ab video is fantastic. I like that I can access it online, so I can use it other places than just my tv. It definitely has been getting my stretched out abs back into the tight shape they were before the baby. And I really feel it during the workout. I have even felt confident enough to buy and wear a new swimsuit already. My belly is flat and my hips and thighs keep shrinking.

The workouts are quick enough that I can squeeze them in while my baby naps or is in a content mood to sit there and watch his silly momma. (he enjoys laughing at me while I workout!) I have no complaints about this program at all. I am looking forward to using it to knock off these last 7lbs.

I simply cannot say enough wonderful things about it!",1304985600,3,1615,3.9876160990712073

I can get a great workout in my home and cancel my gym membership and save money and travel time.  This video worked my entire body and challenged me.  I was able to do all the moves.  I was even able to customize it by taking it easy when I first started by following Summer's modified version and then working my way up to challenging myself to follow Keri's high intensity.  Thank you so much for putting out a great video!,1303948800,3,537,4.174757281553398
4330696,5,B004CYVZ6I,"I'm an experienced exerciser and usually use what I call the J trifecta: Jari, Jillian and Jackie. However, I've grown tired of them and wanted something new. I had read reviews for this dvd over at this and other sites and since most of them were so positive, I decided to purchase this one.

I'm glad I did! I used it for the first time yesterday and let's just say I really feel it...especially in my hammies! While I don't have a HRM, I'm pretty sure I burned 400 cal and then some!

The instructors are Keri Crockett and Summer Sanders and I really like their demeanor. There are four 15 minute workouts which you can do individually or altogether to achieve the ""400 calorie fat blast"". While you've probably seen many of the exercises, they put their own spin on them as most instructors do. There's also a warm-up and cool-down. Additionally, the music is fun, not too quiet, not too loud.

This is definitely NOT a dvd for beginners or even some intermediates. If you have knee issues don't even think about it. Waaaay too much jumping and not enough modifications. The warm up isn't really a warm up, they get your heart rate up there from the beginning. I guess they have to so they can keep the promise of burning 400 calories.",1303084800,8,1239,4.4734513274336285

The moves are really varied and its fast paced so you don't get  bored and you get alot accomplished in the time you spend with these two charming, effective trainers.  As other reviewers have noted, you need to do the warmup (5 min) and the cooldown (5 min) so commit to exercising for at least 25 minutes each time you put this one into your DVD player - but try to go the distance and do the whole thing for a total body cardio and toning workout.  The cardio is intense - the moves and intensity remind me of the moves in Amy Dixon's Breathless Body workouts - but you do them really intensely for 60 seconds.  Some of the toning moves remind me of Jillian Michaels moves (like the one-legged squats in the third segment - so awesome for the glutes!!)  I guarantee you will be sweating with this one!  I gave it only four stars b/c I think the cuing could be a little more detailed/clearer  - I'm a very experienced exerciser so I didn't have too much trouble following it but if you are unfarmiliar with the moves, you may have to stop and look at what they are doing before you can proceed.  But overall, very nice workout, very effective, the cardio is intense and you can vary the weights you use to make it more or less difficult.  Well done!",1421020800,2,1285,4.2727272727272725

This workout does make me sweat but is certainly not as hard as other DVDs that I own. The segments are nicely done with good variety. They use the same weight for all exercises. To increase intensity, I switch between 5, 8, and 10 lb dumbbells. In the first segment, I use 10 lbs and then 5 lbs. In the 2nd, I use 8s and then 5s. In the core, I use 8 lb dumbbells. This DVD is a great one for people who do not have a large workout space. You can do it in less than an 8x8 area.",1388448000,3,606,3.934959349593496
8424070,2,B004CYVZ6I,"I was excited to receive this workout DVD, especially after reading all the positive reviews. While there are three separate workouts to choose from, what isn't mentioned is that they are patched together. In one instance, the instructors come back for the cool down wearing different outfits! The sections are divided by a screen with words naming which workout you're about to do. This may not bother some people, but for me three continuous, separate workouts would have been better. It's almost like you stop where you're at and then pick up again.

In terms of intensity, yes it definitely gets your heart rate up. And the exercises are challenging And it's also good that one instructor is showing a modified exercise while the other does the full intensity. I thought the cool down part was a bit too brief and felt like the video just ended.

Some people may love this workout DVD (as evidenced by the comments). I was hoping for it to be one of my go-to workouts, but I ended up thinking, ""Who can I give this to?"" I will likely use it periodically but not often. I much preferred Ellen Barrett Live: Sleek Sculpt Express, which I bought at the same time.
