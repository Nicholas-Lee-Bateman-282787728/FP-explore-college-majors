Good ""independent video store"" movie.",1395619200,,147,4.103448275862069
8307933,3,B001H5O8Q4,"""A (fantasy) day in the life of clerk Tom (David Cormican) as he rules Video Depot Superstore...wheeling, dealing and excommunicating as a slightly mean spirit moves him...he completely frustrates sexy pop star Mindy (Rachel Sehl) as she tries to get her career ending sex tape back...(acting good, 2nd half better, needs two views to appreciate)...""

8307934,1,B001H5O8Q4,"I thought the dude was cute, (Tom) but he's a major douche because he refuses to give this ""pop star"" back a tape that she accidentally returned in place of the movie ""Glitter"", which, actually, compared to this, is a GREAT film... The store clerk is rude, arrogant and borderline sadistic.. The two banter and bicker in a very low budget way about this tape, which is in fact a sex tape the pop star ""Mindy"" (Rachel Sehl)doesn't want to get out.. When Tom finds out what it is, he plays cat and mouse to her anguish and will not relent the tape. He even forces her to be humiliated when customers come into the 3rd rate video store and has the tape playing, with her nearby.. Most of the customers are either rejected from the store, have their memberships canceled at this guy's discretion or they leave angry.. They're rude, crude unfunny and annoying.. These are Canadians..they are supposed to be friendly.. Canadians acting like rude people from New Jersey, doesn't play well. It's as authentic as thugs from Montana..

This is not a good movie. It's not funny, not charming and Tom, played by David Cormican just comes off like a hypocritical snobby sleeze ..Kinda reminded me of Paul Rudd in ""Overnight Delivery"" or ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", but Rudd was never this annoying or obnoxious..It is a little like the movie Clerks, in a way..but not. By the way, the movie is only 75 mins long..and some kid walks out with the tape and they end up having to leave the store to go purse the tape..THE END.. I'm serious, that's how it ends..No resolve, but we're to believe ms. pop princess/porn star has had a form of Stockholm Syndrome and is now sweet on the guy who humiliated her, played mind games all day long, was arrogant and ultimately lost the tape to little kid... Again, Tom is cute in a Paul Rudd kinda way, but not cute or smart enough.. Maybe Paul's never talked about brother..for good reason..Avoid this movie.. I saw it for free online.. but even free, I want some sort of refund.. Yes, I did ruin the ending of this direct to video borefest, if you want to call it an ending, but you're welcome.",1378339200,,2116,4.510416666666667
8307935,1,B001H5O8Q4,"This movie is so bad it didn't even qualify for a Redbox Kiosk, rather it was in the .99 cent quick sale box at a video store. That should speak volumes. It wasn't even worth that unless you think spending one hour and fifteen minutes watching (they couldn't find enough to fill the standard 90 minutes) of someone standing for the whole movie behind a video rental checkout counter renting and receiving VHS tapes (Yes, it's that ancient.) and exchanging juvenile insults with customers. Seriously, that's it and fortunately we have the use of FF.",1321056000,,548,4.778947368421052
