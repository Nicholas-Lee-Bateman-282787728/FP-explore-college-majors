3565192,4,B001F7AUOI,"Awesome anime, i'm not an expert or anime aficionado but i love me some Cowboy Bebop and Attack on Titan, and i really enjoyed this. If you've seen/enjoyed Seven Samurai then this won't disappoint. Its a lot more light hearted with less adult-oriented subject matter than the previous animes that i mentioned, which i know will appeal to some but deter others. But just because it's more kid friendly than some other stuff doesn't mean an adult can't enjoy it as well.  My only real qualm is that the theme song isn't as catchy/epic as some other ones that i watch but thats not really relevant to most people. While some characters are just meh, you will definitely become attached to a few of these Samurai and enjoy their character development.  I encountered some brief but very irritating skipping on disc one despite it being scratch free, specifically in episode 2. Maybe this issue is unique to my boxset but if it isn't then anybody else encountering this issue should complain (nicely, but honestly) because people are throwing down bank for this stuff and shouldnt have to deal with disc issues right out if the box",1431561600,,1126,4.739795918367347

3565220,5,B001F7AUOI,"This is one of my favorite Japanimation series.  Although it is sometimes a bit clunky trying to shoe-horn the concept of the Seven Samurai into a far-future mecha/fantasy, this series performs admirably.  It comes off nearly as a Japanese ""Warhammer 40,000"" (which for me, adds to the appeal).  The fight scenes between sword-wielding samurai and enormous ronin-mecha are implausible, but the light magical element and futurism make it palatable.  As always, the Japanese is far superior the English dub.",1343260800,,505,5.3544303797468356

I could turn my room into a dojo and make some Samurai montages because...it's that good. If you purchase this for the small price of 30 dollars, know that you won't have wasted a cent if you truly enjoy compelling anime that leaves a mark in your mind to remember forever.",1340064000,,533,4.505154639175258
3565222,4,B001F7AUOI,I really enjoyed this but didn't absolutely love it. Nice animation. Interesting story. Mostly likable sprinkled with a few annoying characters. Recommended on blu-ray for sure. I can't say I will be watching it over and over. But it's definitely worth a go,1328659200,,257,5.0
3565223,5,B001F7AUOI,"I was lucky enough to get this box set for real cheap during a lighting deal on amazon and I did not regret it.
Yes it is an anime and some people wonder why you want to see it in HD since they think it looks the same on HD but they are soo wrong. The fact that Samurai 7 is a mixture of 3D CGI and animation makes it transfer into HD very very well. The subtitles were also very well done. I usually prefer fansubs because alot of companies like funimation really screw with subtitles, but Gonzo has had a really good track record of quality subtitles.

Story wise:
I loved Kurosawa's 7 Samurai and seeing it turn into an anime with a very cool twist was so very satisfying. Each character was truly unique and entertaining. Like any good film, you feel for the character, you cheer for them or you despise them. Samurai 7 did this and I was very happy that they had so much fun with the series.
The one thing that bothered me a tad bit was that there are some corny lines (mostly about ""being a samurai"") but in general the dialogue choice also matched the characters.

There's really not much else to say except that the upgrade to HD is well deserved and looks great, the box set looks clean, and it was a fun 2 day marathon of watching all 26 episodes. If you can find it on sale, go for it! If you can't, get it anyways!",1324944000,,1326,4.135658914728682
3565224,5,B001F7AUOI,"I don't usually watch much anime, but this one had me hooked the first time I saw. One thing I notice though is, it's a lot better when I'm watching with Japanese audio and the subtitles are turned on. You get a lot more emotion and the characters are more suited to the Japanese language anyway. I bet this goes for most anime's from Japan, but as I said before, I don't watch much anime so I'm just commenting about this one in particular.",1316649600,,441,4.261904761904762
3565225,5,B001F7AUOI,"Just a short review, I will comment on the quality. The Bluray scan of this series is very good. Superb picture up to top 1080P standards. The show is also great based on Seven Samurai (Akira Kurosawa film.

The storyline was good, but I didn't like the futuristic Samurai's they were just weird looking robot machines. I honestly thought they were going to look like some kind of cyborg, I think that would've made this series a 1000X's better if they had went that route. And while the action scenes were good, I still wanted more better fights, the hired Samurai were excellent but when they fought the machines it was really boring except the machines that actually looked like some kind of cyborg they were really good fights. And one of the 7 Samurai the machine one was kinda annoying for most of the movie. This series also kinda dragged on, I think they could've made it with about 16 episodes and it would've been better. Also if you watched the English dubbed with the subtitles the words were so off it was like a totally different storyline. It didn't match anything that was from the Japanese language which I really couldn't understand.

These 7 men from different walks of life that have one thing in common, they're all samurai.  If your an anime fan and don't have this in your collection, then your collection will never be complete.  When you watch this series keep an eye out for ""Kyuzo"" he is a beast...hands down the best samurai of the 7.

3565262,1,B001F7AUOI,"I absolutely love Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, I have watched it several times at the theatre and I own the dvd. I was really excited when I heard there would be an anime series based on this lengengary film. This anime is terrible! The characters have no depth, they are just caricatures. This anime could have been so much better but instead it is just a farce of the great film. The characters are the usual black and white good guy/bad guy. This is not an adult anime but for kids. The characters are plain stupid with no personality but the usual bad guy/good guy crap you see in the teeny bop anime. What was so great about Kurasawa's film was the depth of the characters meaning of what is good and bad. The philosophy, ethics, social roles/meanings, social commentary and morality of the great film is not even visible in this anime. The Seven Samurai was a great film that influenced other great films after its birth from the Magnificent Seven to Ocean's Eleven. If you love Kurosawa's great film, The Seven Samurai, don't even waste your time with this anime. Kurasawa must be rolling in his grave right now.",1269043200,,1116,4.585

3565297,5,B001F7AUOI,"Imagine combining all the best elements of classic and modern anime, manga, and Japanese folklore to re-tell one of the greatest stories ever told.  With great drawing, writing, directing, and sound effects, Samurai 7 does that.

This series was originally created for television.  So don't expect it to be as visually-stunning as Appleseed Ex Machina, for example.  But what the series lacks in budget it makes up for in skill, talent, and ingenuity.

You'll never see the same scene twice, because the settings, angles, filters, lighting, shading, etc. are constantly changing.  In each of the 26 episodes, there'll be 3-4 moments where you'll go, ""Wow, that looked amazing, what a brilliant idea it was for the director to....""

If Akira Kurosawa, the legendary director of Seven Samurai (1954), were still alive today, he would be proud of this series.  Everyone involved in its making should stand up and take a bow.",1260057600,,921,5.052980132450331

3565299,5,B001F7AUOI,"I'll keep this short and sweet. My boyfriend owns the DVD version and we both fell in love with the show the first time we watched it. As soon as I saw it was going to be on BluRay I knew I had to have it. It is absolutely money well spent! Samurai 7 is by far one of the best animes I have ever had the pleasure of seeing and it holds a firm position in my top 5! You name it and this series has it; action, adventure, comedy, drama, amazing battle sequences, giant mechs and even a little romance. The characters are well developed and I fell in love with all of them (minus Kambei, the hero worship he receives is quite frustrating!). The animation is practically flawless (with the exception of episode 7) and the CG elements are outstanding in HD! The sound quality is what really blew me away though, everything is so crystal clear and I will not rest until I find a bumping surround sound to watch this show on!! Samurai's versus mechs may be a little hard for some people to swallow but trust me when I say, this is hands down one of the best animes ever created and if you have the money and a BR player you absolutely have to buy this BluRay box set!!",1250121600,,1161,4.1415929203539825
3565300,5,B001F7AUOI,"Samurai 7 is without a doubt one of the best samurai animes I have ever seen. It is right up there with other great shows about these honorable warriors, such as Rurouni Kenshin, Shigurui: Death Frenzy, and Sword of the Stranger.

Unlike the above shows however, what makes Samurai 7 unique is its blend of technology with feudal Japanase culture. In that regard it is similar to Afro Samurai, though in my opinion it is portrayed more realistically and not thrust into the viewer's face the way it is in Afro Samurai.

The blu-ray transfer is spectacular, with both the visuals and the audio flowing crisply and vibrantly from your HD television. Also, unlike many animes the english dub is fantastic, and the entire cast does a great job.

Bottom line: Believable characters, good story line, beautiful animation and sound and great fight scenes without an excess of gore. Samurai 7 has style and substance, but it is definitely not style over substance (Afro Samurai anyone?). Highly recommended!",1245801600,,999,4.934523809523809

The picture quality is pretty decent, though not the best that I've seen for animes, partially due to the style of the series.  The only negative I can say in this review is about the condition of the product when I received it.  When I opened the package, the spine of the cardboard was sort of ripped and when I took one of the cases out a whole entire corner was broken off of the case.  Not really a big deal, but just as a note, Amazon (and affiliates) need to ensure the packing is done better to insure that these things don't happen.",1240272000,,667,4.068702290076335
3565303,5,B001F7AUOI,"Akira Kurosawa's 1954 film ""Seven Samurai"" is regarded as a great and influential film that is among the few Japanese films that has captivated audiences worldwide for so long.  The legendary film was about a village of farmers hiring seven samurai's to protect the village from bandits has been revamped for GONZO's 2004 anime ""Samurai 7'.

First appearing on the anime satellite television channel Animax in 2004 as a high definition CS-Pay-Per-View series, the series was later shown in the US on IFC (International Film Channel) in 2006.  Unlike the film which takes place in feudal Japan, ""Samurai 7' takes place in a cyberpunk era that blends together feudal Japan with high-technology with mecha robotic suits.

""Samurai 7' also has quite a bit of talent behind it as the series is directed by Toshifumi Takizawa known for directing classics such as ""Dirty Pair"", ""Crusher Joe"" and ""Big Wars""(and also storyboards for mecha anime such as ""Mobile Suit Gundam Zeta Gundam"", ""Mobile Suit Victory Gundam).

Character designs are by Hideki Hashimoto (known for a lot of key animation work for ""Heat Guy J"", ""Great Teacher Onizuka"" and ""Mobile Suit Gundam"") and Takuhito Kusanagi (known for his mechanical design work for ""Blue Submarine No. 6' and ""Tower of Druaga"").

The series begins with the villagers of the rice village of Kanna.  Peasants who are forced to harvest rice for the  Nobuseri bandits.  The Nobuseri are ruthless as they take nearly all the rice of the villagers and even go as far as taking their women and children.

The villagers hardly have anything to eat but the villagers know they can't live life the way they are living now and so, with the approval of their village elder, three people will take their remaining rice to find samurai's who will fight against the bandits and free the village.

The village send three people to hire samurai's with their rice.

Kirara: The village priestess who has a crystal that can read the hearts of people.

Komachi: The young sister of Kirara

Rikichi: The male villager who accompanies both Kirara and Komachi.  Rikichi despises the Nobuseri bandits because they took his wife.

During their search in the city for samurai's to protect the farming village of Kanna, the city's heir to Ayamano, Ukyo, develops a crush on Kirara and wants her to join his harem of women.  But each time he tries to kidnap her, the samurai's thwart him and thus leads to Ukyo trying to find ways to kill the samurai's and capture Kirara.

During their search for samurai in the city, the three eventually find the following samurai who agree to fight against the bandits.

Shimada Kambei - The great samurai who is emotionless since he has been in so many battles and witnessed so many deaths that he lives in his own shadow of pain, constantly asking other samurai of why they became a samurai.  The person becomes the leader of the group.  Awesome fighting skills.

Katsuhiro Okamoto - The first samurai that is willing to help Kirara and the others.  A young and inexperienced samurai who idolizes Kambei and eventually becomes the protector of Kirara.  Eventually grows as a samurai after his first major kill.

Gorobei Katayama - An entertainer and former samurai from the great war who is good at detecting intruders and also has unmatched defensive skills by catching an opponents weapons with his hands and quick to dodge attacks.

Shichiroji - A former samurai who fought alongside Kambei.  Now runs an inn and has a fiance but decides to join his friend in battle against the bandits.  Fights with a big staff with blades and has a prosthetic hand that is used as a grappling hook.

Kikuchiyo - A huge cyborg who is always opinionated and always trying to prove himself as a samurai.  Has great strength and carries a big chainsaw word to fight but he is not that smart.  A child at heart, Kikuchiyo  bonds with Kirara's younger sister Komachi.

Hayashida Heihachi - A samurai who is laid back and rather eat or be cool than fight.  A former mechanical/combat engineer, his knowledge of mechanics provides useful for the team.

Kyuzo - A former bodyguard and talented samurai warrior for Ayamaro, an is an enemy of the samurai's  in the first part of the series.  Both Kyuzo and Kanbei go into battle against each other and end with a draw.  With both men finding enjoyment in their battle against each other, they vow to fight again.  Kyuzo eventually joins the team when he finally finds a great opponent in Kambei.  Joining the group because he wants to be the person to fight and kill Kambei, so therefore he  joins the team and lends them his skills as a talented samurai.

For this Blu-ray disc release of ""Samurai 7', the first two discs contain a total of nine episodes each with the third disc containing the final 8 episodes plus the special features.

VIDEO AND AUDIO:

""SAMURAI 7' was originally a series shown in high definition in Japan.  So, needless to say, the picture quality is very good as it is in 1080p High Definition, 169.

With that being said,  it's also important to remind everyone that this is a television series and not an OAV or a film which have a bigger budget and much more detail in the overall animation quality.

In Japan, many of these animators have only a week to get an episode done and often are working on other anime series at the same time, so that being said, ""Samurai 7' does have beautiful segments during the CG segments but in terms of the animation, character designs are simplistic, color pallet is solid with not much shading.

And for animation that utilizes less detail, this gives the animator more time to focus on the action sequences which they definitely did for ""Samurai 7'.

So, you can expect to see really good detail when it comes to the CG segments especially during the two wars because there is a lot of mecha battles that utilize the CG.  And the background renderings often get the most detail.  But picture quality is clear and there are scenes that do showcase a lot of vibrant colors.  But for those most part, there is a softness in terms of colors.  More focus on earth tones and greens.

For some, a drawback is that nine episodes are put on each disc, some enthusiasts would rather have 4-5 episodes with a higher bitrate but with the style of ""Samurai 7', this is a television series not an OVA or film, so one can not expect a super-detailed series.  The picture quality is a step up from the DVD release but what ""Samurai 7' will appeal to are the audiophiles.

For the audio, audio is presented in Dolby True HD 5.1 in English and Japanese.  First, I must say that I was impressed by both voice acting in Japanese and the English dubs.  For one, rarely do you get the Japanese audio track in Dolby TrueHD 5.1, so I started the series primarily watching it in Japanese and was in awe of the actual mix and the utilization of the rear channels.

You hear the people in the city chatting and talking at a distance.  You hear sound of people talking coming from one side and then the other.  Especially in the action scenes and hearing the explosions and blasts and bullet shots.

I switched over to the English track in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and the track also displays the same audio which is fantastic.  The voice acting was very well done on the English side of things and overall, just impressed with overall audio quality.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

There are a good number of special features included on all three discs.  For disc 1 and 2, you will need to go to the episodes listing and you will see episode 1 and episode 14 contain a commentary feature.  The commentary is based on the English voice dub, so for example episode 14 would feature the ADR director Christopher Bevins,  R. Bruce Elliott (voice for Kambei) and Sean Michael Teague (voice of Katsuhiro) commenting on the various characters and how they enjoyed the vocal performance of their co-actors.  Of course, English voice dubs are never going into the technical commentary on the animation and why certain scenes are the way they are.  But for those who enjoy commentary by English voice dubs, especially these two talents, then you'll definitely enjoy these two commentary tracks.

On disc 3, there are several special features.  Included are:

  * Promotional Video - In Japan, their promotional videos for upcoming series are quite long and in this case, this five minute video features the CG action-packed battles and also introducing the Japanese cast involved in the overall production.  The video is in Japanese with English subtitles.
  * Textless Opening and Ending - The textless opening and ending theme to Avex artists Nanase Aikawa's opening theme ""Unlimited"" and Rin's ending theme of ""Fuhen"".
  * FUNimation Entertainment Trailers - Trailers for FUNimation Entertainment anime series and film releases.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Samurai 7' is a pretty interesting take on the Kurosawa 1954 classic but I admit that I totally dig the concept of combining feudal Japan with steampunk technology.  For anime, to combine samurai battles with mecha robot suits seems unbelievable, but within the concept of what ""Samurai 7' is about and the overall journey of these samurai trying to protect the peasants and their village was quite fun.

The characters all have their own unique abilities and characteristics and the series is just all out non-stop action.

This is my first experience of watching an anime television series on Blu-ray.  In the past, most releases were typically film or OVA-based but with ""Samurai 7' having the high definition background when initially aired in Japan, the picture quality is clean but at the same time, it's detail is mostly within the CG scenes and the overall animation, relies on simple character designs that is typical with anime television series versus  a film or OVA which the animators have much more time to work on.

But like a next gen video game, an anime series is not all about its graphics, for this series, what works is the adventure, the journey, the action and its enjoyable characters but most importantly, a well-crafted storyline.  During the first 18-episodes, I really enjoyed the fight for the village but then there was a short lull as the episodes started to focus on twisted, protagonist Ukyo trying to usurp in power and become the next emperor and then suddenly getting back to the action-packed storyline and setting up the ultimate war.

There are some who may not see the need for high definition with their anime, especially if you are going to watch it on a 17-24' computer monitor but for those who want to watch anime in HD on their large television screens (especially using HD projectors) and seeing more detail and of course getting Dolby TrueHD sound in both Japanese and English is a plus.

Overall, I really enjoyed ""Samurai 7'.  It manages to hold some of the enjoyment that made the original film so classic but the incorporate the adventure and the ""other world"" type of features you would expect from an anime series.  Again, samurai vs. mecha suits?  Who would of imagined that?

3565305,5,B001F7AUOI,"I own the collector's edition of the original series on regular dvd and I'm not sure yet if its worth getting the new one. Anime is a weird thign to put on blu-ray because it doesn't suffer from the contrast and lighting issues that plague most movies.  The sound can be easily bumped up in quality to either 5.1 or 7.1 dolby surround, if thats important to you. I just don't feel that most anime does any better on blu-ray than it does in upconversion.

If you do not own this set yet however and own a blu-ray player, this is a very reasonable price for such an incredible anime series. Being a remake of a classic cultural story from Japan, its already steeped in history, but the reimagining of the series and book is just incredible. I've never fallen in love with a main character like I did in this story. He is simply one of the most tough-A-$-$-ed anime samurai you will ever meet and he is everything that epitomizes the samurai code. The story features many characters that are believable, well developed, and consistent as well as great themes that still hold true today in many respects. Whether your in for the story or the action, it doesn't matter, its worth it on both counts.

The animation technique is much like Burst Angel or the Karas movies in that they combine some cg elements with the anime to create some jaw-dropping scenes which include sword-wielding tough-guys taking down gigantic machines in ways you never thought possible. Far-fetched? Sure, but its some of the most fun I've ever had escaping into an anime world. I highly recommend this series to anime lovers everywhere.",1221350400,,1608,4.635087719298245

8301151,4,B001F7AUOI,"Just like the Magnificent 7, they started with Kurusawa's Seven Samurai and sort of expanded it. They added some steam-punk-ish elements and flying fortresses and set it in the future. The basic story is there, but the telling is radically different.",1483488000,,250,5.121951219512195
8301152,5,B001F7AUOI,"Just finished watching ""Samurai 7"" released by Funimation.
Jeff H. gave me the blue-ray release of the complete series for my birthday this year.  [A few Channukahs back, I had given Zack Newsome the complete series when it have been a regular DVD box set release.]
A homage to legendary Akira Kurosawa's classic epic feature film, Seven Samurai - which has seen several Westernized remakes - including the most recent remake of ""The Magnificent Seven,"" ""Samurai 7"" tells the story of how Konna Village decides to take a stand against the reign of terror by Nobuseri bandits - cyborg Samurai who have given up their human bodies for machine ones.  The  Nobuseri bandits demand and take women from all the surrounding villages along with the rice that they grow.  ""Samurai 7"" is set in a futuristic feudal world.
The elders of Konna Village decide to send Water Priestess Kirara on a mission to the distant city to find Seven Noble Samurai who will defend Konna Village against the Nobuseri bandits. All they can offer to pay the Samurai with is rice - the task of finding seven Samurai who will be willing to take huge risks for so little a reward is daunting.
With the help of her dousing crystal, Water Priestess Kirara does find Kambei, who initially refuses her pleas for assistance until he rescues her when she jumps to her seeming death in order to avoid being a concubine for a spoiled merchant's son.
Kambei then goes searching for six other Samurai to defend Konna Village.
""Samurai 7"" mixes in computer animation with traditional animation in building a complex world that is ruled by fear and an blind obedience to accept one's fate in life.  Some in Konna Village have decided to fight back and that doesn't set well with the elites, and even some of the villagers who call Konna their home.
""Samurai 7"" also looks and examines, though from a distance, various kinds of love people have for one another and the depths to which their own personal guilts and demons plunge them to.
Mild Spoiler Alert:  Do not look for a nice, clean romantic ending to this series. There is no happily ever after.  Life goes on for Konna Village after the Samurai defeat the  Nobuseri bandits and young lovers part company.  Even Kambei looses the love of his life.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
FIVE STARS!",1477180800,,2291,4.7218045112781954
