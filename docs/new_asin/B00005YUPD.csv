1677554,4,B00005YUPD,"This is a really enjoyable movie. It's one of those obscured films that got lost in the shuffle. That is a shame. The script is good. It's a bit trite at times, but so what? Everything is nowadays! I think that if you take it for what it is (a road movie circa 1994) you may just like it.",1017360000,,288,3.8983050847457625

1677644,5,B00005YUPD,"This is a good movie. Jared Leto is pretty good lookin' as is Jake Gyllenhaal. Selma Blair is great in her character ...well heck they all are! This is set back in the time of when Kurt Cobain committed suicide. If you like any of these actors, I suggest you watch it. It's fun! Even Jeremy Piven is great in this and it perhaps gave him a bit of practice for his Smokin' Aces character!! Sexual content and drug references.",1457395200,,424,4.3125

1677649,1,B00005YUPD,"A trippy road trip movie about two slacker barely adult guys who have fled the area where they live after being threatened by a thug and his henchmen after one of the men slept with his wife.  This movie had such promise on paper two actors who were on the verge of stardom but they had to star in this clunker.  It's a chase movie, a drug filled movie, a youth gone wild movie and possibly one of the dumber subplots of the film it's an alligator boy movie. I was bored 45 minutes in but tried to watch it and I even really wanted to like it but it just got sillier as time went on.

Leto is a horny poolboy who has had a fling with his employers wife who's husband is a local and rich thug and when he finds out he wants Leto dead.  Leto grabs his loser best friend, a very young looking Jake Gyllenhaal who's goal in life is to get high and have sex and the two leave town after a run in with some of the thugs henchmen and decide to hit the road and then decide to go places and see things and the death of Kurt Cobain makes them want to go west.  And then it gets worse. Real worse.",1447718400,,1087,3.922727272727273

1677682,4,B00005YUPD,"Before becoming household names, Jared Leto, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Selma Blair were all cast in an independent movie, that was so unlike anything we've seen to that point, that it led to the creation of many of the quirky road trip films we see today. 1994, In a Las Vegas, Pilot (Gyllenhaal) is a small time drug dealer, and his best friend, Jack (Leto) is doing a mobsters wife. Life seems great for these high school dropouts, until a series of screw ups lead to them becoming targets. After stopping for prostitutes, (because that's what guys on the run typically do) they embark on a trip to Seattle where they pick up a hitchhiker (Blair) and prove that they are every bit as crazy as they are funny. Eventually the group winds up in Seattle, for the memorial to Kurt Cobain, where things get even stranger. The talent of this young cast is evident right from the beginning of the film, and you won't believe the amazing things that happen to them during their epic road trip. There have been a lot of best friend teams in films like this, Bill & Ted, Harry & Lloyd, Alan & Phil, but I would say that despite being completely overlooked, Jack & Pilot may be the best of the bunch. This film clearly paved the way for the buddy road trip comedies that followed and did so in such a way, that I felt like I was back in the 90s, watching a true cult classic. I say it all the time, but films like this are the reason I watch so many independent films. Highway is worth every minute you spend on it and is an absolute must see movie!",1446249600,,1534,4.311418685121107

At the beginning these two young men are just irresponsible boys out to have a good time, but as the story progresses each one discovers kindness and loyalty and sacrifice, and for one, true love with a most unlikely girl.  By the end of the movie all three come through their trials with an unshakable friendship.  It's a movie that makes one care deeply for the characters.",1432857600,,405,4.597222222222222

1677758,5,B00005YUPD,"The first 20 minutes of this movie are hysterical. The first 20 minutes are one of the funniest movies of all time. However, after that, the movie almost drops the whole comedy facade, and becomes pretty much a drama. For the first 20 minutes, I give this 5 stars. There is also one plot twist that is a sour note, but the beginning is so funny that I still rate it highly and say that you should see this!

Jeremy Piven's main scene is flat out hysterical, and one of the best pieces of comedy acting I've ever seen. The whole movie is worth watching just for that.",1413676800,,566,4.2407407407407405

Jared Leto plays an amazingly good looking womanizer just looking for a shall we say ""release"" lol Jake plays a drug dealer that likes to sample his products and can't get a rise.

The plot summary which stated this is a pilgrimage to Seattle for Kurt Cobain's vigil is thankfully bogus.  None of these characters seem to be Nirvana fans.  There are moments the characters become realistic and you forget you're watching a movie.  The chaotic energy of these counter culture young people is the major reason to watch this.

1677791,4,B00005YUPD,This movie is filled with likeable characters.  My favorite is a drug dealer played by Jeremy Piven - hysterical.  Entertaining movie filled with adventure and laughs and peppered with suspense.  Be prepared for lots of drug use.  I like it!,1346976000,3,241,4.95
1677820,5,B00005YUPD,"As a Jared Leto fan I have seen most of his movies and of all of them Highway is my favorite. It was never meant to be a huge blockbuster movie with some deep moralistic plot intended to launch the cast into superstardom. This is simply a fun movie about friendship, love and taking people for what they are. Leto and Gyllenhal are great as a pair of stoner kids from the wrong side of the Vegas tracks who have to hit the road after Jack (Jared Leto) gets in some very hot water with the local mob boss. On the way to Seattle they meet a cast of colorful characters that add comic relief and the plot's love story. John C. McGinley and Jeremy Piven are priceless, they steal any scene they are in.

Overall, while not Oscar worthy this movie has a good story, good humor and is very well acted. As far as indie flicks go for me, it was a 10.",1311638400,2,842,4.1030303030303035
1677821,4,B00005YUPD,"This movie was a surprise.  Expecting a naive and surface-only journey into the drug culture of today, it went into the dark crevices of the human heart and yet, maintained a sense of humor, regardless of the subject matter.  Jake Gyllenhaal proved once again that his selection of diverse movie roles sets him apart from all other of the new actors, this role of Pilot not being an exception to the rule.  Jake, like Brando, Nicholson and Penn, has again made a wise choice displaying his intensity and moodiness that is so appealing in diversification.  He has not even gotten close to showing his full potential, but I imagine it will blossom further and to the delight of hard core performance seekers like me.  I recommend this movie on many levels.  It's a broad spectrum of film genre from a road movie, to a comedic tapestry, to a character study, to the ultimate end, a satisfying ending.  I recommend this movie to those who are looking for more than a laugh and a tear.  This is for us who are starving for solid performances and intellect, and the ever-medicated value of laughter.  Well done.",1281916800,,1105,4.654639175257732
1677822,5,B00005YUPD,"I loved, loved, loved this little movie. It is my ""Breakfast Club"" of the 2000's. There was such great chemistry between Leto & Gyllenhaal & also between Selma & Jared as well. I can not believe I missed this straight to DVD film from 2002. I confess I only wanted to see it because I am a big fan of both of the main actors & had heard from a few other Jake fans that it was very good. Well, it was definitely worth every penny to purchase it as it is one I can watch over & over again like The Breakfast Club. Pilot Kelson, (Gyllenhaal) & Jack Hayes (Leto) take off on a crazy road trip from Vegas to Seattle to try to escape some crime lord's goons that are sent to break Jack's feet for boning his wife. Set in '94, with a great soundtrack full of excellent punk rock, the goons follow them up to Seattle and what mostly ensues is their drug addled antics that are often more poignant than funny. The clever, ever philosophical Pilot with a heart of gold manipulates Jack into going to Seattle for only one reason, to find his fantasy girl from the night of graduation. Jeremy Piven has a cameo that is a riot & John McGinley totally delivers as a wild, older dreadlock wearing stoner they pick up on their trip. A major word of warning, this movie is not for young teens as it does not have any teaching moments about drugs being bad for you & actually almost glorifies being a dealer. So that said, if you are an adult with an open mind that does not find drugs offensive, I highly recommend it.

One thing I want to say about the DVD itself is it did not have ANY extras at all, no deleted scenes or gagreel which I missed very much.  Knowing how much of a cut up Gyllenhaal can be on set, I would think there would have been a lot of footage they could have included for bloopers.",1280880000,3,1788,4.164739884393064
1677823,4,B00005YUPD,"As with most movies, viewers will be on both sides of the fence. This movie is no exception. A number of people simply didn't like it. I, however, am on the other side. There are any number of road flicks out there and I've seen my share, but this was one of the better ones in my book.

What makes this work for me are the characters. Yes. The John McGinley character is over the top and the Jeremy Piven character is WAYYYYYY over the top but they have really good scenes. The kind of scenes you rarely get in movies.

The story is pretty basic. Jared and Jake are buds since forever. Jared gets caught with his woowoo in a bad guy's wife's honey pot and the 2 are on the run to Seattle so Jared doesn't get his feet busted.

These are interesting people. They all have their stories and there is a whole homosexual underpinning between the two. They aren't necessarily good people and you probably won't want to sit and have a beer with them but you do find yourself liking them in spite of their trashiness. Maybe it's because they really aren't bad people and not particularly given to violence. They're just lost.

The performances and the writing bring this to a the upper, upper levels of viewing enjoyment. Everyone does a fine job. The directing, production design, music etc., etc., etc. are all pro level. The pace is so even you can practically set your watch to it. And it doesn't run on too long. It knows when to end. And like too many Hollywood movies this does not have a happy ending. Jake's fantasy explodes and the cavalry doesn't show up in the nick of time. But there's hope.

If you at all like these kinds of movies and left of center type characters. See this movie. I doubt you'll be disappointed.",1277337600,,1724,4.391849529780564
1677824,4,B00005YUPD,"Highway is a quirky indy road movie (there is even a Jack Kerouac quote at the end of the film)which I found to be pretty good:  sadly tragic characters, bittersweet ending, lessons learned.  Jared Leto and Jake Gyllenhaal are the film -- their portrayal of boyhood friends tightly bonded and loyal to each other propels the film along.  There are two hilarious and great supporting performances given by Piven and McGinley, drug dealer and aging hippy, respectively.  And for those of you who are Leto fans, this is a must-not miss movie -- Jared Leto in this movie is hot, horny and sexy!  His charisma and body are irresistably smoking hot!",1274054400,7,643,4.756756756756757
1677825,3,B00005YUPD,"This film was never meant to be a blockbuster or catapult anyone.  Actually, it's very forgettable but there are some small themes in the film that have stuck with me, (don't worry, no spoilers) such as settling for something broken, coming to terms with your position in life and how unfair it is, and how things change and you can't plan your future on yesterday's certainties.  The acting is good enough and never felt stilted or forced beyond the waist-high emotional tone present in the movie and any parts that felt awkward were probably due to the script.  The soundtrack and editing sometimes distracted me with its poor or unexpected pacing.

This film is ideal for a young person trying to make a pretty picture out of the pieces from a less-than-perfect life, avoiding responsibility for their actions and clinging to some silly idea of a former interest.",1267488000,,866,4.831081081081081

1677828,4,B00005YUPD,"I wish I could put 5 stars here because I enjoy the movie so much, but I can't because it's not a 5 star movie.  It's not a shawshank redemption, an american beauty, or a forrest gump.  What it is is a really entertaining movie for anyone who has ever delved into the subcultures of life.  If you know the alternate meanings of blotter, rolling, and blunt  then you'll probably enjoy it.  If if you've ever lived life without regard, or for the sake of getting lost in a moment, you'll like it.  If you love Dazed and Confused, but were unfortunately born into the 80s instead of the 60s, you'll like it.

1677829,3,B00005YUPD,"Sex, drugs and rock and roll, yep that about sums it up.  One reviewer questioned the ""purpose"" of the aligator boy.  I think it was to show Pilot's compassion.  Pilot pretended to be going on the road with this friend to help him escape thugs who were after him for sleeping with their boss's wife, but he was really trying to track down a fellow classmate from high school for whom he had an unrequieted love.  When he finds her, he realizes she's more messed up than he is(and that's really messed up), and she has no idea who he is.  Sorta makes him realize the value of the girlfriend he left.

It took me about three weeks to finally check it out cause once I read the back for plot points I thought maybe it was a mistake. Wow was I wrong. I thought this movie was pretty damn good. The two main characters compliment eachother nicely and it's a classic story underlining what friendship/life can throw at you. Yes theres also an underlining message screaming...""This is what can happen if you do drugs/sleep with someone elses wife...""

And while that may sound stupid it makes for an entertaining movie because well, state of mind!! Think what the characters might be thinking to do what they do and say.

""Desmond the Alligator Boy is a major happener"", who the heck can say something like that? Well, Pilot!

I'm anti drugs so this movie assures me that using drugs is senseless and I don't need to have that in my life in order to be happy. But Pilot (Jake Gyllenhaal) is high a lot so what he does/thinks/says is influenced by 'the influence'. *wink*

More importantly, movies like this make me miss my friends if they're not around. And if they ARE around you'll laugh at the movie's jokes and start remembering your own inside jokes and your own stories because it is what it's all about.

If you videotaped at least 72 hours of your life with your friends it would look a lot like ""Highway"" sans the drugs (or maybe with, lol).

What comes out of their mouths is a whole lot of nonsense and you end up watching these characters go from point A to point D and have no idea why or what they're doing. Towards the beginning of the movie, Leto and Gyllenhaal visit this lunatic before heading out on their road trip. This guy goes on a rant about God only knows what for what seems like 15min and you can tell by the look on Leto and Gyllenhaal's faces that they wish they were in any movie besides this one. All of the characters in this movie are obnoxious and you care nothing about any of them. But what I found to be the most ridiculous is how these character kept bumping into each other. The movie starts out in Nevada and ends in Washington. Somehow, they all just happen to have run-ins. And what was the point of Alligator Boy? Seriously?

This movie should have been 10min long. Leto has sex with that guy's wife, they break his feet, the end.",1129507200,4,1008,4.277486910994765

If you want to watch this movie because you're a fan of Kurt Cobain - don't bother.  However, if you want to go for a frolic in the fields or leave your inhibitions at the door of the ""Dan D.

1677852,4,B00005YUPD,"I think I appreciate this movie a little more because I actually got to be an extra in the ""rave"" scene. I've seen a lot of movies and I can honestly say that if I hadn't been in the movie, I would still rate it as a pretty good movie.

  I like the fact that it relates a lot to real life. There are still potheads in this world no matter what age; there's people who make fun of other people; and there's a lot of people who take risks on others (such as Pilot). No matter who you are, you can't say that you haven't taken a risk on someone. Whether it was helping them out, getting to know them or going back to someone you thought was the same person you had once known. It's sad that the world works this way but nobody's perfect.

 In that era, there were a lot of people doing all kinds of drugs and a lot of people liked Kurt Kobain. (I grew up in the little town of Sumner, WA which is where they filmed the restaurant scene, their hotel was filmed in Algona/Pacific, WA; and the ""rave"" scene was filmed at Rock Candy in Seattle, WA.) I thought this movie would never come out because it was filmed in the summer of 1999 and it wasn't until 2002 that I heard a couple friends say that they had seen it. The movie's name started out as ""A Leonard Cohen Afterworld"". This is a very hard to find movie so I bought it off of Amazon.com and I'm very satisfied. If you think about actors in real life...such as Jared Leto...he reminds you of a womanizer so he definitely played the right part. Jake seems a little more shy but is probably glad that he's done more than this movie to become famous. John McGinley is highly unrecognized. He's played in so many roles. He's really done his time but is still an excellent actor and the sad thing is that many that know him by face don't know him by name. I actually got to talk to ""Boneman"" which was played by what he called himself George Nathan? He was in the room upstairs at the rave with the black hair that curled up on the sides. He told me that he was from New York and was actually going to college there. I loved his and Shannon Leto's hairdo's. Very Hot!

  Anyway, if you relate this movie to real life instead of criticizing it down to every little detail, you might actually enjoy it.",1100563200,5,2248,4.151724137931034
1677853,4,B00005YUPD,"I was very impressed, and this had nothing to do with the drugs I was on!!  Ha!  Seriously, I loved the movie, it hits on several levels, especially if you have frieds like Jack and Pilot.",1099612800,,188,4.194444444444445
1677854,4,B00005YUPD,"Jack (Jared Leto) is shown in his full physical glory. For those of you that saw him in Requiem and wanted to see more skin - this movie will please you immensely.
OK, so I'm saying buy this movie to see Jared Leto bump & grind away in the buff. I think that's hell of a reason.
Jared, if you're out there - you are one hotty!",1075680000,6,326,3.8805970149253732
1677855,4,B00005YUPD,"Highway (James Cox, 2002)
There are any number of reasons to watch James Cox's first feature film, Highway (not least of which because Cox directed one of 2003's most talked-about and controversial films, Wonderland). It's hard to say the film itself is one of them, oddly enough.
It centers around two stoned-out buddies, Pilot (the always wonderful Jake Gyllenhaal) and Jack (Jared Leto, looking for all the world like Charlie Sheen in Repo Man here). Jack, the womanizer, has found himself in bed with the wrong woman, the trophy wife of a mob boss, and needs to get out of Las Vegas. He and Pilot head for Seattle after one of the most surreal drug buys in all of film (the dealer played by Jeremy Piven, recently seen in Black Hawk Down and Very Bad Things, deserves a film all to himself). Along the way, they find themselves repeatedly entangled with a homeless runaway (Selma Blair) and an old hippie trying to get to Seattle for the Kurt Cobain vigil (John C. McGinley). The stage is set, and the movie makes its Easy Rider-esque way through the West.
The main reason to see this movie is that Jake Gyllenhaal and Jared Leto are fantastic actors. Blair (soon to be in the much-hyped Hellboy) and McGinley make great foils for the two. I'd be hard-pressed to call this a comedy, but it does have its share of uncomfortably funny lines. It ends up, however, being (as odd as this sounds) a lighthearted tale about the myriad ways in which one's dreams can be shattered.
Did I like it? I still haven't figured that out. Would I recommend it? Without hesitation. *** ",1071100800,20,1572,4.614285714285714
1677856,2,B00005YUPD,Jared Leto plays Jack...Jake Gylenhaal plays Pilot and Selma Blair plays Cassie..Leto and Gylenhaal skip town after Leto boffs this Miranda chick and her husband sends out goons after them...though ok in some spots this movie goes into a long era of involving Snakeboys..a crazy drunken Jeremy Piven(why he's in this movie we don't know)...going to a whoreplace and meeting John C. McGinley....the snakeboy is too scary though the premise is great..boffing some rich guys wife and then leaving town..its a good story but then with all of the rest of the stuff we get lost into a pit of spunk and spit out at the end..only the end is good and the actors show their real talents...if you wanna watch this movie..take the train..not the highway,1070841600,,741,4.84251968503937
1677857,2,B00005YUPD,"Solid performance once again by Jake Gyllenhaal, unfortunately the movie tries way too hard to be hard-hitting and meaningfully deep, and ends up instead coming off as overly pretentious and empty.
Everything is set to impress the youth of today with extreme coolness, ecstacy, weed, acid, crime and plenty swearing. ...and don't forget about the alligator-boy!??????? I wish I could. (bad bad bad)  Anyone who grew up during this period will find blatant inconsistencies.
The movie is, for the majority, set soon before and immediately after the death of Kurt Cobain, yet includes none of Nirvana's music in the soundtrack - it is instead provided by one of the members of the Black Crowes, and is pretty decent.
An early 90's Nostalgia / Road trip movie about a couple of Hunter S. Thompson-esque characters which essentially relies on Leto and Gyllenhaal to keep you watching until the end.
John C. McGinley gives an 'interesting' performance as Johnny the Fox.
I would definately strongly recommend hiring instead of buying this movie, if you feel you just have to see it.",1065312000,,1076,5.011173184357542
1677885,2,B00005YUPD,"I am going to use the word 'hip' a number of times in this review, so I decided to look it up and see what the defintion was in the context of how I will be using it.  The internet dictionary says the following -
1.  Keenly aware of or knowledgeable about the latest trends or developments.
2.  Very fashionable or stylish.
This movie had it's moments, but they were far and few between.  Jared Leto plays Jack Hayes, a guy on the run because he was having an affair with another man's wife.  And the man just happened to be connected to the mob of sorts, so he sends three goons after Jack to mess him up.  Kind of hard to feel any sympathy for this guy, as he pretty much gets what he deserves.  Next we have Pilot, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, a stoner who agrees to travel with Jack from Las Vegas to Seattle, intially as support, but later it's discovered he has his own motives.  He's a pusher who smokes a lot of pot, so again, another character undeserving of anyone's sympathies.  Finally, we meet Cassie, played by Selma Blair.  After the boys make a quick stop at a brothel, the hook up with Cassie.  Cassie is a prostitute who sort of fell into the business and stayed in because the money was good.  Another wonderful character.  There were some funny moments, with scenes involving Jeremy Piven and John C. McGinley, but overall this movie fell kinda flat for me.  I enjoy the road trip type movie, Fandango being one of my favorites, but, with that movie, I developed an interest in the characters, and wanted to see what happened next.  It's like you wanted to put yourself in the group, go with them, have the experiences they're having, but there was none of that in this movie.  I felt little to nothing for the characters, as they were a bunch of self serving a&&holes.  At the end of the movie, when one character got caught and punished, I couldn't have cared less.  Actions have consequences, and negative actions usually have negative consequences.  I know this wasn't supposed to be a full on comedy, as I think it was supposed to be a reflection of the gen-x culture, much like Easy Rider was a relflection of the 60's counterculture, but it didn't come off that way. The exagerrated attempt to be quirky and hip really showed and fell flat, like a can of soda pop left open for too long.  ""But"", you ask, ""how can a movie with characters with such hip and cool names like Pilot, Johnny the Fox, Scawldy, Boneman, Moon, Shanks, and Softboy not be cool?"" Well, there you go.  Mildly amusing at times, but trying too hard the rest of the time.  You can't make a concious effort to be hip.  Either you are or you aren't.  And the harder you try, the less you are.  You want to see a good road trip movie?  Check out Fandango or Easy Rider",1058832000,6,2759,4.3713163064833
1677886,5,B00005YUPD,"This is a great movie to watch with your friends.  It's hilarious, especially when they visit Skaully's house and Skaully bugs out.. so so funny.  Gyllenhal and Leto have a very natural chemistry together.  Aside from the foggy story line, it is very true to life.  I could picture my friends and I enjoying a road trip much like this one.

1677888,3,B00005YUPD,"HIGHWAY is an offbeat thriller about two guys Jack (Jared Leto) and Pilot (Jake Gyllenhaal) setting out on a road trip in 1994 to attend a vigil for Kurt Cobain. Jack is also trying to avoid three goons who want to break his legs after he is caught in a compromising position with a married women (Mary Steenburgen). Selma Blair plays a hooker who goes along with them and Jack soon falls for her. Also good is the barely recognisable John C. McGinley as a dreadlocked, pothead hippie (New Zealanders, does this remind you of a certain MP?).
HIGHWAY features music by Rich Robinson from The Black Crowes. There's an amusing scene where Jack chainsaws the top off Pilot's car while he is asleep to make it into a convertible. But the biggest standout for me was Desmond the Alligator Boy in his brief but (literally) slimy appearance.",1048291200,,833,4.635135135135135

It was terrifically acted by all of the three leads (Jared Leto, Jake Gyllenhaal, Selma Blair), and they made all of the characters likable even though no one of them were honorable people.  The performances save this movie from a weak plot. And while this movie is definitely not for everyone, I reccomend it to people who want to see a movie that is different from every other movie out there.",1040947200,5,471,4.595238095238095

1677891,1,B00005YUPD,"I went through a lot to get this movie.  After going to 2 video rental stores and failing to find it, I finally decided to buy it because it had something to do with my favorite band (Nirvana), and my favorite actor (Jake Gyllenhaal) has a large part in it.  Let's just say that I was very disappointed.  The dialogue was horrible and predictable.  The plot made absolutely no sense.  At times there were attempts to be philosophical but failed so badly it made me laugh out loud.  By the end I couldn't care less about the well-being of the characters.  I was insulted by the use of a Kerouac quote after the final fade-to-black.  For you Jake Gyllenhaal fans out there: the only thing it will ever have in common with DONNIE DARKO and BUBBLE BOY is that Jake is in it.  I am a struggling college graduate who expected way more out of this experience and now I want my money back.  This is advice coming from a person with a BA in film who has intensely studied the subject for 7 for years: DO NOT BUY IT.

As always, Jared Leto gets as many freaking fingers I can possibly put up for his performance. He was intense and amazing. Jake Gyllenhaal was also wonderful, bringing light undertones to a would-be dark and dubious character.
