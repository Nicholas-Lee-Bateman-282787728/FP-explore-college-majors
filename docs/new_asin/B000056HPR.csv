8172813,4,B000056HPR,"The plot is simple. A disgruntled ex-husband sabotages a plane his ex-wife and new husband are on as if to say ""If I can't have her, no one will"" with a bio-chemical bomb he placed on board. Good, tense, solid airplane disaster movie that somewhat shadows the 1966 TV-Movie ""Doomsday Flight"" with real hard edge-of-your-seat suspense. A fine addition to the ""library"" of airplane disaster movies. Don't miss this one!!",1112227200,2,418,4.985714285714286
8172814,5,B000056HPR,"I love this movie. It is a sensible thriller because there actually is a plot and everything in this movie is a part of it.
This is not a thriller with guts and gore to make you disgusted,
everything make sense I reccomend this movie to people who liked Speed, Mission Impossible 1, Virtical Limit and The Pelican Brief. I hope You enjoy this movie.",1029974400,2,349,4.384615384615385
