8266237,5,B0017JHCP4,"Being a great fan of classic film noir, I have to say that I made a pretty good deal buying this set of movies issued by MGM and 20th Century Fox.

The set includes 10 unforgetable pieces of what they used to call and still call film noir. Film noir is a unique experience which combines many elements from betrayed love, heists, human dishonesty, dirty cops, questionable characters, some elements which brought this genre to life (German Expressionism, mostly Fritz Lang, Murnau and Lubitsch), fast moving camera work, situations you can not possibly think you will escape from and so on. Let's not forget that Hitchock was among the first to introduce this genre to the audiences worldwide as well together with Fritz Lang and Jean Renoir (European Director's still working in Europe at that time). And another great director which helped to cemente the genre, Orson Welles.

For this collection you will find for sure movies that you will not forget, althought at the release time they were considered to be B class movies they got the status they deserve once the time has passed: A Bullet for Joey (starring Edward G Robinson), Kansas City Confidential (one of the most influencial in the pack), The Stranger (D. Orson Wells, starring Edward G Robinson, the Master himself, and Lorreta Young), The Woman in the Window (D. Master Fritz Lang), Vicki (a remake after I Wake Up Screaming), Shock, 14 Hours (D. Henry Hathaway), Dangerous Crossing, Daisy Kennyon (D. Otto Preminger) and Black Widow.

Once you start with classic film noir, you will not be able to stop from watching. Dangerous entertainment!:)",1240704000,10,1610,4.9335793357933575
