8532483,3,B00136MBS4,"The films in this set are not that bad, but none of them is actually a samurai movie - the closest is Samurai Reincarnation, which is not that close.  It contains Kung-Fu for Sale, Kung Fu Punch of Death, Fists of Bruce Lee (which doesn't have Bruce Lee in it), Samurai reincarnation, Snake-Crane Secret, Duel of the Iron Fists, Chinese Hercules, Militant Eagle and Dragon Lee vs the Five Brothers.  So if the cover and title leads you to expect Japanese sword-fighting - as it did me - think again!",1216684800,2,499,4.533333333333333
