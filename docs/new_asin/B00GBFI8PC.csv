8621954,2,B00GBFI8PC,Good basic info but not a ton of it. Should be cheaper,1490486400,,54,3.5833333333333335
8621955,2,B00GBFI8PC,"This course is nothing at all like the Trading Pro System. If you, like me, where expecting an updated version of that course then save your money. This is a poorly organized ""maybe"" 3 hour course (16 10-15 minute videos) where the author kind of rambles about going mainly over his views of technical charting methodology, with maybe 30% on actual options strategies. My only consolation is that I didn't pay the $200 that some websites wanted for this product. There are some tidbits of information, but really nothing new. Extremely disappointing as the Trading Pro System was really quite good. Save your money and go watch some of the archived episodes on TastyTrade.com for free. You'll learn TONS more there.",1407628800,7,715,4.917355371900826
8621956,5,B00GBFI8PC,Learned a lot of valuable information. The DVD itself is full of trade secrets. Couldn't be happier with my purchase.,1396569600,3,117,4.9
8621957,3,B00GBFI8PC,"I thought there might be a crumb or two of something new here, but to my disappointment I've heard it all before. I've been trading for about 30 years so there is very little that comes along that is remarkable in my book. Someone new to the trading game may find a wealth of information here, and I hope they do. For us veterans, I would say there is ""nothing new under the sun"". A man much wiser than me wrote those words some two thousand years ago. Hey it costs about the same as a commission on a 20 pack. You might find something that will help you 100X that investment.",1395792000,6,576,4.151785714285714
