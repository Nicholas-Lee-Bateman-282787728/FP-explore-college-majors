Andrews Blu-ray Review: J.B. Priestleys superb blend of morality play and thriller transfers well from the stage to the screen, gaining much from Alastair Sims masterly performance as the angel of vengeance in the title role. This is a brilliantly successful adaptation of the play which, while remaining faithful to the text, intersperses the dialogue with flashbacks to alter the location somewhat. It's a trade-off and you sacrifice watching the reactions of the characters for a little variety in setting, but it works. It assists what is otherwise a very static piece of writing to become a very good piece of cinema. 60 years old but still tight, riveting and vocal even now, Guy Hamilton's take on J.B. Priestley's stage play 'An Inspector Calls' is worthy of a revisit, especially with this stunning CANALSTUDIO Blu-ray release, that has a lovely and even surprisingly crisp print, it's the perfect time to relive this mystery.

Set in a Yorkshire household during the early 1900s, Inspector Goole [Alastair Sim] calls at the home of a wealthy industrialist Arthur Birling [Arthur Young] to investigate the mysterious circumstances behind the death of a young woman named Eva Smith [Jane Wenham]. Each one of the family has a secret and a series of flashbacks reveals each one of the smug, well-to-do family is partly responsible for driving her to suicide; the father had fired her from his factory, his daughter had got her the sack from a shop, the son had made Eva Smith pregnant, and Sybil Birling [Olga Lindo] had refused her charitable aid.

It is strange to think that in the Swinging Sixties, An Inspector Calls [1954] was thought of as a stodgy drawing room drama that had no relevance. Its true that the action does indeed revolve around a drawing room, but only in the way the eye is at the centre of a hurricane. The drama starts at a dinner party to celebrate the engagement of Sybil Birling [Olga Lindo] to Gerald Croft [Brian Worth]. Her hard-headed businessman father [Arthur Young], mother [Sheila Moore], and feckless younger brother [Bryan Forbes] are also in attendance. However, when a policeman, Inspector Poole, is shown in, these evening pleasantries are exposed as sitting on a raft of lies and exploitation. The inspector is played by Alastair Sim in what is one of his most memorable roles and the determined Inspector slowly proves their collective guilt before a final supernatural twist in the tail.

Alastair Sim was a character actor best known for his role as Ebenezer Scrooge in A Christmas Carol that he had played three years earlier, before this film. He was a very versatile actor who was happy in comedy roles too; also in 1954 he played both the role of the headmistress as well as her dodgy brother in the first of the St Trinians films. Here he is an august, inscrutable presence, keeping numerous secrets hidden beneath his hooded eyes, before making revelations at key moments.

Without giving too much away, the secrets that the inspector reveals all revolve around the way the family treats a young woman, Eva Smith, who has recently committed suicide. All of the party, man and woman, have treated her either thoughtlessly or even abominably. Each small story shines a light on a different aspect of the Edwardian British class system. This includes industrial relations, and remarkably for a play that was written in the prudish 1940s, sexual hypocrisy.

An Inspector Calls is a socialist wolf in frock coated sheeps clothing and a great bit of storytelling too. The various encounters with Eva Smith are shown in flashback, while they are merely narrated in the play, which broadens the action. The script is also very quotable, It isn't only Eva Smith, and it is all the other Eva Smiths. Quite! Directed by Guy Hamilton who went onto make four James Bond films, this is a first class drama that is unlikely to be bettered in its latest incarnation.

Ultimately it is a great snapshot of a changing period in time in British history when many rich old people still believed that war wasn't coming, as shown in the first scene and that workers didn't deserve any rights; while the younger generation were breaking free from the older generation and demanding change. It is also a great example of British film making even if it is slight at 77 minutes and does have a slightly confusing ending which keeps you guessing the outcome?

However, whereas this air of restrictiveness could prove a distraction in other films, here it focuses the attention on the unfolding drama. The arrogance of the Birling family, with their acute awareness of their standing in the local community and constant fear of how any hint of scandal may destroy it, is vividly brought to life by Young as Arthur, the pompous head of the family and Olga Lindo as his aloof wife, Sybil. Equally sharp are Forbes and Eileen Moore as their children Eric and Sheila who, unlike their parents, show remorse when the error of their ways are made clear to them. It's Sim, however, who steals the show. His depiction of Inspector Poole - who may not be all he seems, and has a sinister otherworldliness which haunts the viewer as much as it does the characters, leading An Inspector Calls to linger long in the mind.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The Blu-ray transfer is excellent and the film is full of deeply crushed monochromatic blacks which stand up remarkable well, making this a real visual treat. Ted Scaifes superb cinematography is not wasted one ounce here. Presented in its original aspect ratio of 1.37:1, and you get a brilliant 1080p encoded image. Generally speaking, depth and clarity are very pleasing. The majority of the close-ups, in particular, look very good. During the outdoor footage, shadow definition is also convincing. Contrast levels are stable, but there are areas of the film where minor inherited fluctuations are visible. Light grain is present throughout the entire film, but it is slightly toned down. There are no traces of problematic sharpening corrections and serious transition or stability issues to report. To sum it all up, STUDIOCANAL have done a stunning restoration of An Inspector Calls that will please fans of the film and especially of the brilliant actor Alastair Sim. STUDIOCANAL have provided optional English SDH subtitles for the main feature.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  There is only one standard audio track on this Blu-ray release and that is in the form of a 2.0 LPCM Mono Audio track. For the record, The sound is very crisp and clear, plus there are no sudden spikes or drops in dynamic activity. Rather predictably, however, dynamic intensity is quite limited. All the clicks, pops, crackle, and background hiss have been removed as best as possible and the dialogue is stable and exceptionally easy to follow.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Interview with Actress Jane Wenham [2014] [1080p] [7:00] Sadly the Blu-ray disc is very light on extras, though does feature a nice interview with actress Jane Wenham [Eva Smith] In this new video interview, actress Jane Wenham [Eva Smith] recalls her collaboration with director Guy Hamilton on An Inspector Calls and her interactions with the rest of the cast during the shooting of the film.

Finally, I have to say that Guy Hamilton's An Inspector Calls is one of the best entries in STUIOCANAL 's Vintage Classics series. I was very pleasantly surprised. I have seen other adaptations of J.B. Priestley's play, but somehow missed this film. An Inspector Calls has been recently restored by STUIOCANAL and looks lovely on Blu-ray. Do not hesitate to add this release to your collections, as you will not regret it folks. Highly Recommended!

8015881,5,B0001P044Q,"Once again, I tried to order a movie we much love and find it is not available in USA format! Drats! This is an excellent movie, starring the wonderful actor, Alastair Sim. The supporting cast is very good, but it is Alastair Sim that has the humanity and depth that makes the ""inspector"" so unforgettable. I believe the movie and it's message holds up superbly, even all these years later. It is the best kind of family film, as it teaches so many things: the need for compassion, the folly of judging others, the importance of courage and personal responsibility, etc. I will keep looking (and hoping for) the availability of a Region 1 or USA friendly version.",1334448000,4,663,4.627118644067797

8015884,5,B0001P044Q,"A police inspector calls unexpectedly on the five members of a prominent British family and changes their lives forever.

Who is Eva Smith/Daisy Kenyon/""Mrs. Birling""? Is she the same woman? Did she really commit suicide? Is the Inspector really who he claims to be?

This 1954 film adaptation of J.B. Priestly's stage play is expertly directed and the performances are memorable, in spite of the fact that Alastair Sim (the Inspector) is probably the only actor whose name will be recognized by American audiences.

With the exception of a few brief scenes, the entire play takes place in the dining room and parlor of the Birling family, whose members all seem to be coincidentally involved with the life of Eva Smith, a poor and naive but good-hearted woman who is perpetually down on her luck.

The play's eerie final scene, which takes all of about five seconds, is at the same time heart-wrenching and heart-warming. Of course, I won't give the ending away here.

The only shame is that this 1954 film is devilishly hard to find. It ran several times on Public Television back in the 1970s (when I first saw it), but has been maddeningly absent since then. I managed to find a poor-quality dupe of the film on eBay. Hopefully, Amazon will do us all a favor by putting out a DVD version.

An irreducible masterpiece.",1135382400,16,1321,4.746724890829694
