8593099,5,B000OJCK50,"When my grand daughter was a child, she would watch the video 'Adventures in the Great Stone Balloon' weekly... It was her favorite video.  Now a mother of a one year old, she mentioned she would love to have the video for her daughter but couldn't find a copy. Well, I did and sent for it to give to her on this past Christmas... When she opened the present,the look on her face was awsome..
The video was in its original package...in perfect condition.  This $5.00 gift was
the most precious thing she received that day and now has it to pass on to her child.",1265414400,3,561,4.283018867924528
