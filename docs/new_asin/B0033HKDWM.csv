4065389,5,B0033HKDWM,"Air - The Musical by Jeremy Osbern (director)

This is far more than just a musical - it's about laughter, fun, love and pathos. Many fine scenes with tributes to musicals from the past - you must see it.

This musical love story has an outstanding cast and top notch directing - videography is awesome.

You will enjoy the hidden puns and tributes - and will no doubt want to watch this one again and again.

Fun for an evening with friends - this is definitely a keeper - destined to become one of your favorites.

Thoroughly enjoyable - it's a musical that will keep your attention.

5 stars out of 5 - Buy it!",1270512000,,613,4.28695652173913
4065390,5,B0033HKDWM,"This is the second of Jeremy Osborn's movies that I have seen.  I saw it at the Kansas Film Festival.  It was one of the audience's favorite films out of the more than 20 that were shown.  There is real depth in this film.  Music, drama, comedy thrown in to the delight of the audience.  Be sure to check out all of Mr. Osborn's future films.  He is ""on his way"".",1268092800,,363,4.042253521126761
4065391,5,B0033HKDWM,Fantastic independent film for those who like to be fully entertained! You will not be disappointed.,1265414400,,100,5.3125
4065392,5,B0033HKDWM,I saw AIR at a film festival and it literally blew me away.  The music and the story are both top notch. It's like CRASH but a musical. AIR is very original and the Director Jeremy Osbern creates  some stunning and memorable moments; the visual sensation that is AIR will be with us for a very long time. I would say that this movie is a must have for everyone who loves musicals and great stories.,1264636800,,398,4.223684210526316
4065393,5,B0033HKDWM,"I saw this film when it won first place at the Kansas City Film Festival.  It is one of the best combinations of story line, photography, humor, direction and an amazing variety of music that I have ever seen in a film.  It blends together so well you are riveted to the screen throughtout the entire movie.  I would recommend this DVD to everyone.  It is AWESOME!!

4065394,5,B0033HKDWM,I saw this at the Macon Film Festival and was really impressed.  Air is a really well crafted story of various people trying to find love and their place in this world.  The music is fun and diverse and it really moves the story along in an emotional way.  All together this is a great film about how people all move to a different drummer.,1264377600,4,340,4.2
8387964,4,B0033HKDWM,"Rather odd, but fun movie.  My daughter is into musicals, so I added this to my watchlist on Amazon.  We decided to give it a try one night.  It's very creative and artsy, but rather amaturish.  The songs are off with their vocal tracks, and the instruments often overpower the voices.  We often were laughing so much that we missed the words of the songs, but enjoyed them anyways.  The intermingled plots and charachters were a bit confusing, but trying to figure out what was going on was part of the fun.  Some of the acting was not great, but some was good.  At times, we were laughing like crazy.  My teenage kids liked it, and the tap dance/paint dance scene with two charachters was very creative and fun - the best part, according to my daughter.  I might have been upset if I had paid to see it, but it was great for a free movie on Prime.  My son called it ""a needle in a haystack"".",1511395200,,893,4.255952380952381
8387965,4,B0033HKDWM,"I didn't know what to expect when I started Air The Musical but I was pleasantly surprised that I liked it.  Oh, it's not an Oscar worthy effort but I found myself watching intently only once checking how much time was left in the movie and that happened when I was interrupted.  The acting was really pretty good.  I felt emotions for the characters.  The music was also nice once I got past the poor lip syncing.  I do enjoy happy endings for the most part.  I recommend it.",1500508800,,476,4.292134831460674
8387966,1,B0033HKDWM,"I ""love"" musicals, but this one was, sadly, a pathetic attempt.  The music was poorly executed, the acting unconvincing, and, by the time the picture was blown up on my screen, it was fuzzy and pixilated.  I couldn't watch more than the first 15 minutes.",1482451200,,254,4.622222222222222

8387969,4,B0033HKDWM,"These guys did a pretty amazing job considering the limited budget. Some excellently composed and photographed shots, acting isn't half bad and the music is likable. Some of the choreography was less than spectacular but then again, limited budgets mean X amount of time to shoot scenes.  Overall, a pleasant movie that should make the production team proud.",1406851200,,358,5.172413793103448
8387970,3,B0033HKDWM,The music written for the movie was awesome. For it being an independent film done by a student and on a low budget it was okay.,1380585600,,128,3.9615384615384617
8387971,1,B0033HKDWM,I love musicals but I couldn't even get a few minutes into this because the audio track is so off from the video. Awful cinematography killed what could be a good movie. I'll never know.,1369612800,,186,4.3428571428571425
8387972,2,B0033HKDWM,"I put this movie on my wish list based on the fact that it had ten 5-star ratings.  After watching the movie, I've come to the conclusion that all ten of those reviews came from people associated with the movie.

The script had potential, but was poorly executed. It's three stories in one movie, and it isn't until the last scene that two of the stories kind of come together (although there's doubt about that). Each story on its own would have been interesting had it been more fleshed out. Only one of the stories had any reason to have any sort of musical theme tied to it, and it was that story that made the best (although, still subpar) use of the music.

The acting left so much to be desired. For a short while, I wondered if the director had used non-actors as the stars of the movie for a reason. It wasn't until halfway through the movie that I realized these were just bad actors, not non-actors. If not for a screenwriting credit, I'd assume that this movie was entirely improvised by a troupe of actors in a beginners acting class.

The music was ok. I doubt it would ever win any awards or sell any soundtracks. It was music that an amateur writer would throw together, and I have to wonder if this movie wasn't made just for the purpose of showcasing the film makers attempt at writing music.

The singing was just plain bad. There were a couple of scenes where the singing was ok, but for the most part, not one actor could carry a tune. One actor in particular couldn't hold a note in just one song.

There was only one scene in the entire movie that was remotely worth watching again. It was a dance scene with no singing, involving ""tap"" and spilled paint (an homage to Singing in the Rain?).

Again, all of the 5-star reviews that have been given simply had to have been written by people involved with the movie. Don't waste your money on this one. If you get a chance to pick it up for free at the local library or get it from Redbox for $1, give it a try, then PLEASE come back here and rate it so that others aren't fooled into buying it due to the false reviews given prior to mine!",1330819200,5,2110,4.273182957393484
