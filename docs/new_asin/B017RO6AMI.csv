7512687,3,B017RO6AMI,"The opening scene introduces the antagonists, two renegade Union scouts in 1865 raping and pillaging their way through South Carolina ahead of the troops, leaving a trail of bodies. Two sisters (Augusta, Louise) and a slave (Mad) remain on their farm while father and brother are off dying in the Civil War. The older sister Augusta happens upon the two rogues and narrowly escapes back to Louise and Mad. The remainder of The Keeping Room is a humorless Home Alone with no Macaulay Culkin. Seriously though, there's more to it than just a home invasion story, as the opening quote [borrowed from history] suggests: ""War is cruelty. There is no use trying to reform it. The crueler it is, the sooner it will be over.""

The Keeping Room is more or less an unconventional Western. Especially unconventional in that it was shot in Romania (perhaps because our own South has so many Walmarts that a filmmaker can't even do a wide-angle lens shot without catching one?) It's a story of three dissimilar women ""making it up as they go along""; not just survival without men, but survival in an acutely perilous situation. I'm not a scholar of the Civil War (so can't make any statements about historical accuracy within The Keeping Room), but I can see this particular tale at least being plausible.

Brit Marling (Augusta), a rising star of the indie film scene, is proving to be a versatile actress. Hailee Steinfeld (Louise) of the recent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10-000-Saints/dp/B011QLAWPO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10,000 Saints</a>&nbsp;is proficient as the little sister, but the best performance is by Muna Otaru as the slave Mad. Is it just me, or are the Southern accents of the two sisters here sort of bizarre? Maybe every Southern actress was already booked for a part in The Walking Dead, and that's why these two were hired to play South Carolinians? Amy Nuttall (Ethel Parks in Downton Abbey) also has a part in an early suspenseful scene: the trusty ole saloon standoff. Lots of tense moments in The Keeping Room, but also some time for subtle, mostly unspoken philosophy.

All in all a decent flick, although its appeal is certainly limited: the crossover between fans of both Westerns and grrl power movies likely isn't a significant demographic sliver.",1450569600,11,2317,5.140583554376658
7512688,5,B017RO6AMI,"Splendid Civil War story--great acting by some great actors.  The terror and resolve of the three females living alone at the end of the Civil War is palpable--uncannily real.  Filming, production, and direction all combined to create a real masterpiece.  A lot of attention to detail.  Highly recommended.",1483142400,,306,5.3125
7512689,4,B017RO6AMI,"Set in 1865 at the tail end of the American Civil War we meet two sisters and their former black slave who have been left to fend for themselves on the farm since the war has taken away all the men folk. The new way of life sits uneasy on the younger sister balking at her new lowly status as a mere field hand.

Then a chance occurrence means her elder sister  has to go to town and in so doing crosses paths with two Yankee soldiers who are part of an advance foraging party. They are no lovers of the rule of law and as William Tecumseh Sherman has said War is cruelty. There is no use trying to reform it; the crueller it is, the sooner it will be over. These guys seem to want the war to end much quicker than most would countenance and bring their own brand of cruel. Thus is set in motion a plight and fight for survival as the soldiers set about getting what they really want.

Now this is part of the new clutch of westerns that bring gritty realism with modern sensibilities, and I am a fan. It is done really well with god attention to period detail and a keening authenticity that makes the characters mire believable. Couple this with a string cast and a good story and you have nigh on all the ingredients for a very well made film.",1481932800,,1246,4.140495867768595

7512696,2,B017RO6AMI,"The Keeping Room isn't really a film you'll want to watch for entertainment,  Sure it probably a realistic portrayal of the crimes that happened under the excuse of these are the enemy, and it wouldn't be unique to the American civil war, when I traveled around Germany I heard a lot of stories similar to this movie's one.  But acknowledging the evil of war and the hell those left behind went through when the opposition came through where they lived doesn't make a great movie.  For me the women weren't that likable, with the exception of the slave.  The younger was openly racist and constantly demeaning to the slave and showed no respect or appreciation to the other two women who kept her alive on that farm while the rest of her family was a war.  The older one was inconsistent in her behaviour towards the slave, at one point she tells off the younger one for speaking to Mad that way, then at another after the little sister clearly wasn't even following her orders and obviously wouldn't have been able to stop the little sister running off away from her chores, she yells at her and assaults her.  She also didn't come across as that intelligent, which you really need your character in this sort of situational film to be, even if she didn't know exactly what was going on, she should have just left the pub slave auction house as soon as she walked in and realised something not right is going on here. Would you really expect your horse to still be standing there with a viscous snapping dog metres away by simply circling the log (porch railing) with its lead or whatever you call that thing. She surely should have at least tied it up better.  Why she also didn't kill at least one of the people that were obviously going to kill the two friends who had saved her when she had the chance as well was a bit ridiculous.  Nor does she even warn the others to prepare, practice firing the guns, or even just to hide in the woods until the men have been and gone or something, for probable inevitable arrival on their farm.

Overall the movie was very predictable in parts, characters put something down you know is going to picked up by others, it uses the old I thought you were dead, but you're not thing a few times, as well as is quite boring for most of the film.  When the most exciting part of the story happens, the credits roll.  They could have condensed the whole movie into ten or fifteen minutes then told the more interesting after the ending story for the rest of the movie.  You never really get to know much about the two rapist murderer characters, we just see them doing both these things and setting stuff on fire.  A few conversations between the two as to how they are justifying this behaviour in their heads wouldn't have been a bad idea. I also have no idea why the movie is called The Keeping Room.  Maybe something like Bad Men Are Coming or something would have been a better title.",1471392000,,2925,4.432835820895522
7512697,5,B017RO6AMI,Being Black is some BS. Liberation was an evil thing. Enslavers are sorely missed. Fight to get your chains back. The North interrupted a long love affair with bondage and rape.

There were many rapes and beatings of southern women and even slaves who resisted! Many southern civilians faced starvation and died from exposure as a result of Sherman's March. General Sherman himself in his own letters to his wife discribed his goal of ""Extermination"" of the southern population.

7512711,2,B017RO6AMI,"I've never focused on this aspect in a prior review, but the writer on this movie drove me up the wall. I tried to watch the Commentary on the DVD that featured the writer (Hart) and the star (Marling). Would love to know why the director or one of the producers didn't show up, but I digress. From her opening hello, Ms. Hart does not shut up. It's all Me! Me! Me! How great am I to write this script and have it tank despite this cast? She wouldn't let Marling talk. Ms. Hart has a clearly inflated sense of her worth. You're a WRITER. Get over yourself.

Having vented on my pet peeve, I'll say the movie is OK, not great. Fine performances from a first-rate cast, though too bad they couldn't get their first choice of Olivia Wilde as Augusta.",1462060800,,747,4.26056338028169
7512712,5,B017RO6AMI,"Tense, taut, and intriguing, The Keeping Room is an excellent period piece exploring the lives of 3 young women who live alone in rural America during the Civil War. From beginning to end, we are presented with compelling visuals and intense acting. Previous to this, I was not a very big fan of Sam Worthington. He did a passable job with Avatar, but I've always felt that his American accent was way too fake. His Southern accent is scary good, though. In fact, Sam Worthington's acting takes a typical villainous character and makes him into a much more complex and engrossing character.

The subtle ways in which the movie plays with gender politics is at once bold and long overdue. It's nuanced approach to race issues is also worthy of applause. All in all, this is a great addition to the Drafthouse Films collection. Definitely a movie that should be seen with rapt attention.",1461715200,,885,4.746753246753247

7512716,2,B017RO6AMI,"Pros:  great storyline,  depicted how life was at the end of the American Civil War.  No candy coat... All the violence was purposeful and realistic.  These people had a hard life, both men at war and the women back home.  Everyone suffered.  Beautiful scenery and special effects.  Cons: no narration of history ( which would have made it so much better). Not much explanation and history given of this family.  Poor character development and all the people in the movie just MUMBLED most of the time. This was a huge detraction!
Worth watching but lacked something... Could have been a really great epic historical saga.  I did think the ending was interesting and believable.  They had to survive and what they did was probably their best bet.  2 and a half stars I would rate.",1460160000,,780,4.703703703703703

7512728,4,B017RO6AMI,"This is not a blockbuster but it does many things well. The cinematography is very good as is the acting all around. The film is not a western, taking place in the deep south near the end of the US civil war and in the path of Sherman's march through Georgia and South Carolina. It's reasonably accurate historically as there were deserters and foragers out on their own away from the main army and that's who two of the antagonists are. Usually non-combatants in war's path fled but in this film we are led to believe the three protagonists don't really have the means or inclination to do so. Women defending themselves as depicted in 1865 would have been unusual but it makes for a good story and strong feminist roles. This film has some similar overtones to ""Cold Mountain"" in terms of that feminist angle. The film is violent and good people don't always survive but for entertainment value I gave it four stars.",1456531200,5,918,4.569696969696969

Out of any number of soldiers from any region or country, there will be bad men (and women too) that will want to take advantage of a bad situation. That's just war combined with human nature. And war is certainly the bad situation that hurts women and children the most of course. I truly believe this movie portrays what life may have been like for many southern women after the war and especially during the early days of reconstruction.

Otaru in particular is amazing and absolutely deserved a nomination for her work.  It is not easy viewing, and the subject matter is 100% adult for 100% of the film.  The story is compelling and original, and the complexity there makes The Keeping Room worthwhile - it could have been a thousand mundane often told tales but instead it takes you into a time and involves you in the lives of people you've never met before.

The slave woman (Mad), who is redefined by Augusta to her younger sister, is really the only character given some history. The story drives home the atrocities of these men against women and more, when left to their own characters, nearly absent of all honor. I don't see this as a chick flick, when women must defend themselves against marauding, murdering rapists. No... it's survival, pure and simple but not without consequence.

This movie does an excellent job of turning the spotlight on how some YANKEE soldiers took advantage of their invasion of Southern homes and property and the spoils of war. It also shows the complexities of how fighting a war can take over someone's very soul and even defeat a once potential romance that ends in a compulsory killing instead. An estimated 620,000 died in the Civil War and 644,000 in ALL other conflicts!
