8356381,5,B0028MGUAC,"Snap, no Tap, Vol. #6 covers the Cecchine system of groundfighting. In my opinion, Vol. #6 is the best of Cecchine's material. This volume covers 3 DVD's worth of information and is really the first one to buy if you cannot afford the whole series. It is pure dynamite for the BJJ/Judo/Submission wrestling practitioner. This volume alone provides months of video training. Solid stuff... 5 Stars.",1308441600,2,397,5.03030303030303
8356382,1,B0028MGUAC,"Phony Cecchine thinks he's a wrestler. But he's never had a pro fight. He's never won a tournament. But he thinks he can beat anyone. I remember watching Lost Art Of Hooking. This guy considers a wrist lock a ""lost art"". That was the most boring, dumbest thing I've ever seen. I don't know why Phony Cecchine thinks he's a wrestler. He can't keep up with any of his lies. He claims he's learned everything from Lou Thesz. Then he put some edited video up on YouTube. All Lou Thesz said was that they're good friends, he never said word for word ""I taught Tony everything that he knows about wrestling."". If Phony Cecchine has never had a pro fight, or a tournament fight how is he so sure he methods can beat anybody.
Do yourself a favor, look for commercial videos put out by real athletes. They make commercial videos too. Phony Cecchine goes under other names and talks bad about anyone who points out questions like mine. You'll never find a Phony Cecchine fight anywhere, there isn't one.",1304899200,,993,4.522222222222222
8356383,5,B0028MGUAC,"Tony Cecchine is a Catch Wrestling instructor, known for his revival of scientific wrestling and his bone snapping techniques. I've had the pleasure of speaking with Tony several times and he is a guy truly dedicated to his art. He's endured constant criticism for his brand of grappling, but has weathered it all to produce what I think is his best material yet.

Snap, No Tap! is the most brutal Cecchine product yet and for good reason..it deals with streetfighting. This isn't a DVD series you buy for clever sport techniques to apply at the gym (though, you may find some). This is series that literally bridges the gap between grappling in the gym and taking care of yourself in the street. I believe, unwittengly, that Cecchine and Paladin have released a ""catch wrestling"" set that should be owned by every grappler on the planet. If you are in Judo or Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, these discs will fill in gaps just not taught in the dojo.

In Volume 6 ""Ground Fighting"", I expected to see a variety of Cecchine's techniques repackaged and reshot for Paladin. Instead, what I found were clever strategies for street grappling and an approach to mindset training rarely seen in grappling. Going over weapons awareness and multiple attacker scenarios, Cecchine brings reality back to grappling. Just as many people watch Kung Fu movies and believe that's what they'll do if they are confronted on the street, Cecchine bursts the bubble of sport grapplers who think they are going to use their newest sport technique to end a streetfight. Cecchine does go over some catch wrestling stand by's with new and impressive instruction. Let me be very clear here, if you do grappling for self-defense, you must by this set. If you are scraping up pennies to buy your next instructional, buy Volume 6 if you can't afford the whole set. It's that good.

In Volume 2 ""Takedowns and Throws"", Cecchine demonstrates takedowns that are street-safe for you and brutally damaging for your opponent. The impressive thing for me in this set is how Cecchine cleary has a complete system. He is integrating striking, striking defense, throws/takedowns and ground fighting to present probably the best street fighting series Paladin Press has ever put out. Volume 2 is much more than a series of techniques, it also has extremely thorough explanations on why you should do one thing and not another. Believe it or not, this is fairly rare for instructional material. Usually it's a bunch of, ""ok, this is what you do if a guy does this"". Cecchine puts a whole fighting philosophy out there and shows that a lot of thought has went into keeping you in one piece. You will learn some great new takes on taking someone down and at the same time, gain more of Cecchine's masterful insight on how to approach a street encounter the right way.

Paladin Press has outdone themselves. I can't see how this set could be anything else but successful. Take it from someone who has seen a lot of instructionals, you haven't seen things that are taught on this set. Anyone, beginner or advanced, will benefit from this set. But I truly feel that every grappler out there should own this complete set. If you buy one set of instructionals this year, buy Tony Cecchine's ""Snap, No Tap!"".
