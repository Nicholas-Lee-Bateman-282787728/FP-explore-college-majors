8543800,3,B009QP334K,"The Dirty Fifteen  - Routine spaghetti western.  Many familiar faces in this one, Hill and Martin go back and forth throughout but the director Malasomma couldn't cobble it together, the ending is an unsatisfactory sell-out.  3 / 5 for the cast and cinematography.
Also a poor transfer from Wild East, among their weakest.

And the Crows Will Dig Your Grave -  another routine spaghetti although a tad better than the above.  Another so-so effort from Hill.  Sancho is slightly less over the top but less effective. Brana is reliable as a heavy but appears late.
Wild East transfer picture quality is better but audio is the problem here. Dub for Sancho was nearly impossible to understand, which may not be that bad a thing considering it's Sancho..  3 / 5",1508803200,,757,4.769230769230769

8543802,3,B009QP334K,"Wild East Prod. Vol. 42 includes two Westerns starring American actor, Craig Hill.  The first, ""AND THE CROWS WILL DIG YOUR GRAVE,"" (1971) tells the story of a deputized bounty hunter who is hired, along with many others, to stop an outlaw gang who has been stealing their gold shipments.  One of the bounty hunters, played by Craig Hill, visits a rural prison and buys one of the former gang members (Angel Aranda) with the hopes that he will lead him to an outlaw hideout. Once in his possession, Aranda breaks free of Hill's grasp only to be pursued by many more ruthless bounty hunters including the genre's best large, obnoxious, loud-mouthed, Mexican pistolero, Fernando Sancho. The film's concept of a bounty hunter buying someone with the hopes that the person will lead them to a wanted outlaw may have influenced the premise for Quentin Tarantino's amazing homage to the Euro-Western genre, DJANGO UNCHAINED. ""CROWS"", is nowhere remotely in the same league as Tarantino's masterpiece, but it is still a mildly enjoyable little film. Overall, this Ignacio Iquino (aka John Wood) directed movie is an average film with adequate performances and a several decent action sequences.  I rate this film with 3 out of 5 bullets.

The other film included in this package, ""THE DIRTY FIFTEEN"" aka ""FIFTEEN SCAFFOLDS FOR THE KILLER"" (1968), is less entertaining and involves Craig Hill's character, along with his friends, being accused of killing a woman and her two daughters and then seeking refuge in an semi-abandoned fort as they are pursued by a posse. This flawed character drama, directed by Nunzio Massi, takes place largely at the fort where the intense pressure and claustrophobic nature of being seized creates an atmosphere that turns innocent allies into enemies and vice-versa.  Although Hill gives an acceptable performance, the film focuses on too many different people's perspectives and suffers from the lack of a strong central character to relate to or who can function as the film's conscious.  There is also a noticeable lack of atmosphere and music throughout parts of the film such as during ""climactic"" gunfights which leaves the action rather flat and seemingly less eventful. I rate this film 2 out 5 bullets.

Both films are acceptable anamorphic widescreen presentations and this volume has extras that include Craig Hill trailers, an interesting interview with Hill titled, ""FROM HOLLYWOOD TO ALMIRA,"" and picture galleries.  My overall rating for this Wild East Vol. 42 collection is 3 out of 5 bullets.",1384992000,3,2535,5.091566265060241

8543805,3,B009QP334K,"In this double feature The Dirty Fifteen was supposed to be the main treat. Well, it is not. It is said about this film that its story is told in a confused way. It is not. It is a confused story. The Crows will Dig Your Grave, however, was a pleasant surprise. Recommended, if you like a hard core bounty hunter revenge spaghetti westerns.",1357084800,4,340,4.328125
8543806,4,B009QP334K,"American actor Craig Hill is represented in the latest Spaghetti Western double feature from Wild East Productions in two riveting doses of bounty hunting gone wrong.  First up is Director Nunzio Malasomma's only western 'FIFTEEN SCAFFOLDS FOR THE KILLER' aka 'QUINDICI FORCHE PER UN ASSASSINO' here bearing the title of 'THE DIRTY FIFTEEN'- 1968 where Hill belongs to a trio of bounty hunters on the trail of horse thieves led by George Martin who hold up at the farm of a widow and two daughters.  When the women are found brutally murdered, Hill and his men must flee with the thieves from a posse led by Aldo Sambrell culminating in a hostage situation and gun battle at a fort leading to the identity of the murderer.  Along with the beautiful Susy Anderson, their are many familiar faces including Andrea Bosic, Jose Manuel Martin and Frank Brana.  The film is abetted by a rousing music score by Francesco Di Massi and awesome cinematography from future action Director Stelvio Massi.  Up next is 'AND THE CROWS WILL DIG YOUR GRAVE'  here presented with its original Italian title and credits 'I CORVI TI SCAVERANNO LA FOSSA'-1971 and is directed and co-written by Ignacio Aquino who went under many pseudonyms here billed as John Wood. This time, Hill belongs to bounty hunters hired by the Wells Fargo Bank to stop the robberies of gold shipments by a sleazy gang led by Raf Baldassare. Hill springs one of the members of the gang played by Angel Aranda from prison hoping he will lead him to the gangs hideout but complications arise as the story starts showing the innocence of him slightly resembling the plot of Director Sergio Sollima's 'THE BIG GUNDOWN' aka 'LA RESA DEI CONTI'-1968 leading to an epic gun battle at the closer.  Along for the ride is Frank Brana again, the beautiful Dominique Boschero, Maria Pia Conte, Indio Gonzales and scene stealer Fernando Sancho.  It contains one of composer Bruno Nicolai's best music scores and the film arrives at the beginning of the decline of the Spaghetti Western genre.  In both films, Hill plays the perfect anti-hero as we are forced to take his side knowing the real scores of his prisoners. 'THE DIRTY FIFTEEN' is presented in its 2.35 ratio but is slightly on the dark side and 'CROWS' is in its 1.85 ratio with a slight deep hum on the soundtrack.  Wild East loads the package with Picture galleries for both films, a wonderful documentary /interview with Craig Hill titled 'FROM HOLLYWOOD TO ALMERIA' showing highlights of his career and Trailers to other Hill westerns.  Hopefully. Wild East will release his best western 'I WANT HIM DEAD' aka 'LO VOGLIO MORTO'- 1968 in a future release. This package is highly recommended to all Euro Western fans and Wild East continues to dazzle the senses with their releases.",1354924800,5,2786,4.819706498951782
