8271805,5,B001946FDC,The self-realization society doesn't provide visuals or videos for energizing exercises as explained in biweekly chapters - but this product fills the gap.  Highly recommend for people preparing for Kirya Yoga.,1515974400,,210,5.774193548387097

8271809,2,B001946FDC,"I thought there would be more to this, you can pretty much download these exercises off of the net for free.  A person could just work through your own muscle groups contracting and relaxing and just stay present with how your body feels ... and get as much out of it as these exercises.  The lady who initially instructs on the video makes her voice sound soft, I prefer to be talked to in a normal voice .. when swami goes through the exercises he seems to jerk through them.. like there is a disconnect.  I don't know, the only one I see benefiting from this dvd is the ones who produced it and are selling it for a ridiculous price .. which I paid.",1429574400,2,652,4.2
8271810,5,B001946FDC,These do work.  I used to find classes which practiced these.  I was so glad to find a copy in video so that I have them at home.  Someone my classmates and I knew swore that practicing these exercises helped to restore their dis-ease from battling fibromyalgia.  Any movement helps the body have purpose and become the best tool for handling the onslaught of the world.  I highly recommend these.  Like any health fitness program results are proportionate to the effort made at practicing them.,1424131200,,495,4.764705882352941
8271811,1,B001946FDC,"Do not buy this bootleg dvd...Beware of any books or dvd's about Paramahansa Yogananda that are not printed by Self Realization Fellowship. They are bootlegged and printed in China.  You can confirm this by the spelling of Paramahansa and where the book is published.  This dvd spells it Paramhansa, where the ""a"" is missing after the ""m"". All of Paramahansa Yogananda's authentic books are printed by Self Realization Fellowship.",1420329600,2,430,5.217391304347826
8271812,5,B001946FDC,"These Energization Exercises were originally discovered and invented by Paramahansa Yogananda. They will provide the sincere devotee with a direct experience of God within your heart. Practice them daily, observe truthfulness, harmlessness to all living creatures, and a sincere attitude towards God with the humility of a small child and soon the Universe  within your very being will unfold bringing a sense of joy and happiness unlike anything you have ever known before. I am infinitely greatful to Swami Kriyananda for making these exercises available to everyone in a non discriminatory manner. The day after Self Realization Fellowship told me that I could never, under any circumstances become a member, I went to one of Swami's ministers who taught me these priceless exercises. They will change your life forever, since you will feel God's presence within your very being. For the sincere devotee, an absolute must have.",1407715200,2,930,5.326530612244898
