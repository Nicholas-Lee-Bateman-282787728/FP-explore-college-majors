It's kinda predictable but I think the director knows that. This movie is reminiscent of ""The Dirties"" and ""To Jennifer"". Overall, Its a decent one :)",1507939200,,387,4.450704225352113

The Last Excorcism (2010), Chronicle (2012)

Long Story Short: Three teens plan to take revenge on their bully and document their every move on camera to show the creation of an epic prank. But things get out of hand and soon a fun idea turns into a nightmare.

Review: Prank is entirely filmed with a handheld camera. The goal of these movies is to work with a low budget but also to create a more authentic atmosphere. We all remember the mother of these movies - The Blair With Project (1998) - and how excited everyone was to see this ""real"" footage. But the reactions were different: many loved it, some got nauseas, while others got bored or fell asleep. I think End of Watch was the only documentary-style movie that succeeded in what it was trying to do, and Chronicle was okay, too. But as far as the shooting-style goes this movie failed. The concept of Prank is very interesting and shows how far things can actually go when bully victims strike back, but at some point the story was all over the place and became totally unrealistic, but then again, when I think about it, things like that could actually happen. Or not? The acting was decent, the dialogues probably,too, but the constant turning on and off of the camera got on my nerves and I was more annoyed than interested. They definitely should have worked more on the storyline, given the the characters more depth, and made a regular movie. If you like these kind of movies watch it, otherwise I wouldn't really recommend it.

8572646,1,B00BQK4Y0U,"seems like alot of guys get a digital video camera today, and they think that they can make a great movie the first time. I didn't care at all for this film... it seemed a little amateurish and made for next to nothing. the acting was very bad and just wish that i would not have wasted my time and money watching it. Oh well, i guess first time movie makers have to start out somewhere, just hope that these guys film making gets a whole lot better. i give this movie a one star... there are no negative stars?",1372982400,,511,4.12
8572647,1,B00BQK4Y0U,"I am sooooo sick of these horror movies that are nothing more than unimaginative videographies that have no budget, friends passing themselves off as actors and absolutely no sense of cinematic knowledge.  PRANK is one of the worst yet.  I gave up after 30 minutes...it just doesn't merit my waste of valued time.  PRANK stank!",1371859200,2,327,4.909090909090909
8572648,5,B00BQK4Y0U,"PRANK stakes its claim among the many genres of thriller by digging deep into the frustrations and alienations of its main characters. This is not just a scary movie about teenage revenge. This is an exploration of the many torments of adolescence, and how the desires for sex, status, companionship, and acceptance are too often thwarted by social brutality. It tracks the complexities of coming of age in a world where young people are both idealistic and unforgiving, passionate and intolerant. Smart dialogue, slick cinematography, and inventive editing - it will keep you entertained and on the edge of your seat. Watch this movie.",1371859200,4,636,5.125
8572649,5,B00BQK4Y0U,"I was also fortunate enough to watch this movie in LA during the premiere. My favorite movies are the ones that are entertaining and also leave an impression on you long after watching it. This movie most definitely does that!! You'll be gripped by the suspense and fantastic acting, (and you might even wonder if you could see yourself in the situation of these teenagers whose 'Prank' goes all wrong). -This is a must see movie!!!",1368489600,2,432,4.697368421052632
