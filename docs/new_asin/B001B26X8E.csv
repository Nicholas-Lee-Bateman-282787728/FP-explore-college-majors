8281442,4,B001B26X8E,"A good instructional dvd. Though non-Gi techniques are the only moves covered, this vid will give you a decent base for submissions and guard passes. Mario seemed to cover the same moves over a couple times to make sure those watching were getting the gist of what he was trying to teach. I would've preferred a translator for some of it, as it seemed like he was having a hard time getting his point across verbally, but he did a good job. Overall a good dvd showing some great techniques from a legend of the art.",1461110400,,515,4.375
