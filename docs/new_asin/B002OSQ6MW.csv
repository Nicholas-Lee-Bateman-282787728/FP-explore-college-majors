8376392,5,B002OSQ6MW,I really enjoyed the movie and I have watched it several times.  It must have been a very hard time for them.,1314230400,,109,3.9545454545454546
8376393,4,B002OSQ6MW,"The book ( same title) of these compelling people and events was my first introduction to this story and I must say the book is un-put-downable. The doco is moving for so many reasons- the simply told horrifying stories of the violence and abuse that the Jews of Pinczow were subjected to, the visible bond between Saul Rubinek's parents , the reunions with Polish neighbours not seen for 40 years...Also very moving is the state of rural Poland in the Soviet years of the mid 80s. The doco is brief, though, I would like to have heard much more about Sofia Baya's life after the war, for instance, but overall, well worth viewing.",1300752000,2,631,4.592920353982301
8376394,5,B002OSQ6MW,"I really only ordered this because I'm a fan of Saul Rubinek in Warehouse 13, and I'd stumbled upon a signed copy of the book by the same name, so I wanted to have this to set next to the book.  But once I took the time to watch, it really took my breath away.  My own family comes from a nearby town in Poland, but we don't speak of it, so all I know is what can be had from vital records and the serial numbers inked on some relatives' arms.  Listening to the stories of others is really the only way I have to sort out what my family might have experienced, and these stories touched me because they focused so much on the little things that, in the end, are really what matter to me.  I understand a lot more about why my relatives are the way they are, and some of the things they've said over the years, and it just made me happy to hear Saul's mother speak in that uniquely Polish, matter-of-fact way, that I usually only get to hear on holidays, these days.  I only wish I could tell him directly how much it's meant to finally understand some of my own past, and ask how he got his parents to speak of their experiences, and how I might be able to get these kinds of stories out of my own relatives, before it's too late.",1294963200,5,1230,4.045267489711934
