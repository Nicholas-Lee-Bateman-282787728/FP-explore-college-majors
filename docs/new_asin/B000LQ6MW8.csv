2712848,3,B000LQ6MW8,"Of course, the content is amazing.  No one since has gotten performances out of kids like you'll find on these shorts. Word of warning, they're racist as hell... well as racist as people were in the 20s and 30s, which is... very. Also, until later years, these didn't have much of a plot or story.  Mostly some cute kids getting forced into weird situations and filmed with a few slapstick moments.

The quality on the other hand... not so good.  Audio is sometimes very hard to understand, and I'm not just talking about Buckwheat.  Someone said these were taken from the Cabin Fever restorations... that is a lie.  I have a few of those on VHS and they're another world of quality.  Sadly, they're gone and hard to find.  So if you're looking to get the Our Gang comedies for a decent price, I guess this series is pretty good, but it's no ""Cabin Fever"" for cheap.",1357862400,,866,4.471337579617835
2712849,5,B000LQ6MW8,"I can only give five stars?????? These are the best I have seen! Immaculate picture quality. I bought all seven!!!! Released this year 2011, they are better than anything released before! Don't buy anything dated before this year for little rascals, this by far is the best. I only see these are available individually. So thats how I bought them. Quality excellent.",1310083200,8,366,4.919354838709677
2712850,5,B000LQ6MW8,"I caught about 12 of the Our Gang/Little Rascals episodes on Turner Classic earlier this month, and I enjoyed the hell out of them.  They looked really great, clearly a careful restoration of the originals had been done.  But I'm not sure where to find the others I didn't catch on my DVR.  Does anyone know - are these the transfers TCM used?  Any info would be greatly appreciated.",1295740800,,383,4.507246376811594
2712851,4,B000LQ6MW8,"Volume 2 will continue the chronological release of the early sound Our Gang (Little Rascals) comedies from 1930 & 1931:
A Tough Winter
Pups Is Pups
Teacher's Pet
School's Out
Helping Grandma
Love Business
Little Daddy
Bargain Day
Fly My Kite
Big Ears

Jackie Cooper shines here as he falls for his teacher Miss Crabtree and has to compete with Chubby Chaney in ""Teacher's Pet"", ""School's Out"" & ""Love Business"".
Wheezer takes the main stage in ""Pups IS Pups"" but the early gang is all there as they invade an animal show with their exotic pets.
The gang's love for an elderly lady who acts as their Grandmother is heartwarming yet great fun in ""Helping Grandma"" & ""Fly My Kite"".
One clinker here is ""Big Ears"" which is a melodrama dealing with divorce.

Over all Volume 2 is much stronger than Volume 1, it is apparent that the Hal Roach Studios have become comfortable with their new sound apparatus and can now focus on producing funny comedies again.

For those looking for Spanky, he will not turn up until Volume 3.
These single discs from Vivetti correct the errors in the ""Complete Collection"":

2712861,5,B000LQ6MW8,A quality collection. Original title cards and credits and 'as-clean-a-copy-as-I-imagine-exists'. Can't speak to edits as I've seen these in so many guises that I don't know what the 'original' uncut version was like. Long out of circulation episodes now included as part of the canon. These were brilliant works with natural talents everywhere. Robert McGowan's direction was Altman-like in its natural simplicity mixed with irony. Can't wait to purchase the remaining volumes in the set.,1363996800,,489,5.533333333333333

8163617,5,B000LQ6MW8,"The Vivendi Entertainment version does not include any Blackhawk prints which are horrible.  Love these 7 Volumes.  I also own the 21 Volumes of the Cabin Fever Entertainment VHS collection.  Our Gang, His Rascals, The Little Rascals never looked or sounded like this back in the day when they were viewed in movie theaters.  Enjoy this snapshot in time which couldn't have happened at any other point in time with any other actors/actresses and with current 35mm film technology",1466121600,,479,5.025316455696203
8163618,5,B000LQ6MW8,"NEWS FLASH for frustrated collectors of this series: While the discs of the 2008 set, which follows the same contents list as these separate discs, did not live up to the 'complete', 'uncut', 'from original masters' claims on the box at that time, it seems that once remastered c. 2011 to better fulfill the promise, each disc was issued separately (as here). Collectors assumed that the boxed set continued to supply the inferior 2008 discs, and that one had to purchase the 2011 discs separately to get the upgrade.

What is less well known, and which I discovered the 'expensive' way, is that these 2011-remastered discs are identical to those being used in current printings of the box set as well. I bought the set (with inferior transfers, many not from masters) in 2008, years later buying these much improved separates, then in the last few months, I bought the box set again. The discs of the set (whose box markings still carry the c. 2008 date - but whose box has dropped the 'from the original masters', 'remastered', 'restored' and 'uncut' claims form the front), all say c. 2011, have the MGM intros where the 2008 set had Blackhawk films intros, etc., and are identical to the 2011 separate disc issues. Though the newer boxes have dropped some of the claim blurbs which were on the original boxes, it remains unclear if they were dropped prior to 2011 during the controversy generated by disappointed fans, or if they were dropped at the same time the upgraded discs were being used. As this remains a mystery, it is still going to be uncertain whether a particular sealed box set will have the 2008 discs or the upgraded 2011 discs, so I would go with purchasing an open set after inquiring with the dealer first.

Good luck!",1464220800,,1742,4.689542483660131
