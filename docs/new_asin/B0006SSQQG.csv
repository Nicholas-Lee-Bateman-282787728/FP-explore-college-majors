8042924,2,B0006SSQQG,"I can't really recommend this disc even though Roan is one of my favorite DVD producers.  The Milky Way with Harold Lloyd is a good print, but there is an excellent print available on The Harold Lloyd Collection.  Kid Dynamite with the East Side Kids looks much better than other releases, but is full of splices and has an Astor Pictures re-issue title card.  Roan really dropped the ball on this by even using a print with missing scenes.  These scenes can be found on other releases.  There was also a problem with the picture freezing during both films, so it might be better to just avoid this disc since these films are available elsewhere.  The only items unique to this disc are the extra interview on boxing movies and the film critic intro.  The interview is good, but this film critic is a waste.  Both films themselves are great, but this disc just isn't.",1247011200,3,867,4.548387096774194
