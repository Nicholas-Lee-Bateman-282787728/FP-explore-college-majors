8533985,4,B0091C227M,"If you can find this box for around $40 - $45, get it. Classic noir. All four films in the set are solid, and as long as you're not expecting something as good as ""Double Indemnity""  or ""The Killers,"" you should be pleased.",1449100800,,223,4.186046511627907
8533986,1,B0091C227M,An excellent looking noir collection from Olive but alas it would again appear that English sub-titles are not provided. I am hard of hearing and my partner's first language is not English so sub-titles assist us both greatly. Unfortunately Olive have not previously implemented English sub-titles for any of their blu ray discs. A great disappointment for people such as myself as this company has an otherwise terrific catalogue. Will pass on this set too,1442275200,15,457,5.1066666666666665
8533987,4,B0091C227M,"So far I've viewed ""Union Station"", and picture quality is very good.

But gawd, what a great old noir this is! Crisp, engrossing, super-gritty, often shocking.

One hair-raising scene in the tunnel toward the end, with the line: ""I wish you could see this, Cookie....a hot seat in reverse.""  That scene alone made paying for the whole collection worthwhile for me.  No further spoilers!

The bad guy Joe Beacom is one of the nastiest characters I've ever seen in cinema, he made me wince! But THAT'S why we love these!

 I agree with the complaints about the $90 pricing, but I paid $48.12 through one of the other vendors.

One complaint I have is the lack of captions/subtitles. Fitzgerald's heavy Irish brogue dialog is very hard to decipher.

Technical Hint: Many scripts are available online:  search the title with ""caption"", ""srt"" or ""sub"" and then open the downloaded file with notepad or wordpad.",1406937600,6,906,4.862745098039215
8533988,3,B0091C227M,"I wasn`t over joyed with this collection, as they were more crime dramas than film noir.  I enjoyed the Crooked Web and Criminal Lawyer most. I can`t really recall any of them off hand, so that`s how impresed I was.",1379894400,5,215,4.375
8533989,4,B0091C227M,"I am a movie buff and I have been since I was around 10. I have always been attracted to the film noir movies and own most of them. This collection is wonderful, Blu ray on film noir, you cant get better. All made in the 50s except Dark City which was made in 1949. A great price for 4 Blu Ray, film noir movies on 4 discs.",1369094400,9,323,3.764705882352941
8533990,1,B0091C227M,"It's about time some of these classics are entering the market as a blu ray set. However, it will be a longer wait for those not wanting to get stung in the wallet. Just to put this in perspective, with 4 films you're paying $22.50/each for this 4-film set at $90. Not worth it. Maybe the price will drop, and hopefully soon.",1358035200,19,325,4.258064516129032
8533991,1,B0091C227M,one star for the price four stars for the potentiality of the films... i was initially very interested in this item when it was first announced as its four films in the noir genre are ones i haven't seen... but this price is astronomical compared to most other products of a  similar ilk... which are generally around the $30 to $50 price range at the most... i hope that olive studio have an opportunity to reconsider this pricey expectation as it may be wiping out most of its customer demographic as is...,1357603200,17,508,4.521739130434782
8533992,5,B0091C227M,"This is a great collection made by Sony Pictures with five Film Noir movies. The quality of the movies are great and Sony did a great job on releasing these on DVD. All movies are in b&w and run for a total of 385mins. This set stars: Jane Wyatt, Frank Lovejoy, Pat O'Brien, Phil Carey, Darren McGavin, Johnny Desmond, Betty Garrett, Merry Anders, Mari Blanchard, John Barrymore Jr., Maggie Hayes, plus others! ""Criminal Lawyer"" is the only one in this set that is presented in Full-screen format and the others are Widescreen (16:9). There are no special features except for a few trailers and there are no other languages or subtitles included. Overall this is a great set for a reasonable price and I would recommend it.",1357257600,17,723,4.700787401574803
8533993,1,B0091C227M,"What is with the price on this -- $89.95!!!  Might be good at half or a third the price, but this insane.",1354752000,31,105,3.772727272727273
8533994,5,B0091C227M,These old b/w are advertised as blu-ray and I have to say the quality of the films is excellent.  There are so many stars in this four disk set that it's amazing...including the first film by Charlton Heston).  Great set by Olive Films.  You won't be disappointed by the films in the set or the quality.,1353542400,17,303,4.375
