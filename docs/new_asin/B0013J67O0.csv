8251205,3,B0013J67O0,"There are more than 30 shorts on this DVD. A few are hilarious and/or very interesting. Some are ""out there"" - so abstract or avant-garde that the message - if there is one - is easy to miss. Many videos, especially towards the end, feel like graduate student final projects. The sound on many of these videos is really awful, so muddy that you can't understand the dialogue at all - which is disappointing on ""Creature Comforts,"" the main reason I bought this DVD. If you are a big fan of Aardman, this collection has enough for you to be glad you bought the DVD. But unless you are a huge fan, I'd say you'd be fine to pass.",1419552000,,626,4.26890756302521
