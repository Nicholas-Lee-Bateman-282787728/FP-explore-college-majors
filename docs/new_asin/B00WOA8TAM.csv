8713857,3,B00WOA8TAM,"It's exceedingly difficult to review this artistic piece. Taken as a whole, the marrying of a symphonic score reminiscent of a horror film with distorted videos of World War One feels less than the sum of its parts. One has to give praise to the instrumental work. The music grips the viewer instantly and provides exactly the kind of grim, foreboding feel the material justifies.

At the same time, though, the disturbing images flash from scene to scene without anything in the way of context. This feels like a sort of short film that would've worked reasonably well at fifteen or possibly twenty minutes in length. Instead, the movie gets expanded into forty-five minutes or so of a picture into somebody's nightmares. It's unsettling without a purpose.",1528502400,,757,4.960629921259843
8713858,1,B00WOA8TAM,"Its apparent that this movie is a trip back in time for the directer in his acid tripping days. Most movie clips are so corrupted to be barley watchable. As a WWI movie/documentary, its poor. Its Poorly done, And rather pointless in its direction.",1506297600,,247,4.636363636363637
8713859,5,B00WOA8TAM,"Seems the other reviewers who panned the video where distracted by the stunning Kronos performance of the Vrebalov score (and make no mistake this is prime Kronos). The video is NOT a simple mish-mash quickly collaged together to serve as a bland or flaccid throwaway presentation frame for the score. Morrison's both dramatic and subtle editing (curating?) is brilliant and works on a variety of levels mapping a clear story, that of a sort of madness evoking the great scope, weight and horrific whims of a lost generation. But Morrison's expertise is not the only star here. The broken down film itself seems an additional character. The persistent colour and tone shifting constantly destabilizes the viewer, the myriad distortions, blooms and explosions of colour, suggesting natural processes beyond human scope and control. It seems that nature itself is outraged, perhaps even at war with the madness documented in the footage.",1498348800,2,935,5.24
8713860,3,B00WOA8TAM,"This video uses authentic films from WWI. I could identify film clips of German, French and UK soldiers. Some aircraft are also filmed in
the air and on the ground. These motion pictures do not appear to have been restored so the picture is often grainy. There is serious
deterioration in some of the sections. Other sections appear quite clear for that era. I have seen many newsreel clips of WWI and everything
in this video was new to me. I found the video mildly interesting.

The best part about this DVD is the music. Balkan composer Aleksandra Vrebalov composed the wonderful music. This is serious music.
I find it hard to describe but if you think string quartets of Bartok and Shostakovich with maybe a pinch of Wuorinen thrown in you will have
an idea what to expect. The music is often bleak and haunting and that suits what we see on screen. The Kronos Quartet plays superbly.
There is an extra feature that shows the Kronos Quartet playing some of the music.

The DVD is rather short but it should appeal to people interested in WW1 filming and/or people who like modern music for string quartet.",1469923200,,1110,4.601010101010101
8713861,4,B00WOA8TAM,"The main value isn't the film, which though visually interesting, is worth sitting still for once.  The real treasure is the music, which is a rich tapestry woven by The Kronos Quartet (God, I love almost everything they do).  The music is worth listening to again and again, whereas, the film is a throwaway.  The manufacturer screwed-up by not putting the movie on one side of the disc, and an audio CD on the other side.",1447718400,,423,4.5394736842105265
8713862,3,B00WOA8TAM,"I kind of like seeing the old World War I footage, although I have seen better footage in other WW I documentaries.  The film is badly damaged but interesting if you are really a World War I buff.  However, turning into an artsy fartsy film with a chamber music score just reinforces my opinion that any film that wins some festival award will be of no interest to non movie critics.",1447200000,,383,4.380281690140845
8713863,5,B00WOA8TAM,"Lost and found.  Amazing that any of this nitrate footage could be resurrected, with timing okay even over the many holes.  This is History with a capital H.",1438300800,3,157,4.571428571428571
