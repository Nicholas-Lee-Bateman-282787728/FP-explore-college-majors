118162,5,0790785366,"What can one say about this film. I consider this Delmer Daves'  masterpiece. It was the first of four productions that teamed Daves and  Troy Donahue (Parrish, Susan Slade and Rome Adventure followed). Troy  Donahue was never noted for any great acting prowess, but he did represent  the last breed of the innocent clean-cut naive teenager. This was Donahue's  strong point and Daves used that persona expertly and effectively to  extract the longing for the eternal youthful spirit in all of us. That is  why this film is so viewable to this day. To paraphrase Richard Egan's  character in the film: Our only purpose is to love and be loved. That is  what this film is all about. Visually it is breathtakingly and lushly  photographed by Harry Stradling. The dialog is juxtaposed between crisp  witty cynicism at times and then beautiful tender passages of poetic  expressions of love. The Max Steiner score and love theme have become  interwoven into our everyday society as effectively as they mirrored the  emotions of the characters in this film. The story at its most basic level  is one of adultery and teenage love canvassed on an island on the Maine  coast. However, the motivations and the ramifications of the characters'  actions run much deeper. The expert cast includes Richard Egan, Dorothy  McGuire, Sandra Dee,  Constance Ford, Beulah Bondi and the actors'  actor Arthur Kennedy. This film was based on the Sloan Wilson novel. This  is one of my favorite films. I highly recommend it. The VHS copy is very  good.",965865600,188,1530,4.89453125
118163,2,0790785366,"This movie is too campy to be earnest, but too earnest to be campy. I was expecting some sort of Annette/Frankie kind of romp, but instead got a sad sack movie that tried way to hard to pound home some dubious points. Sandra  Dee's mother is a tiny bit of fun as the evil queen type, and the scenes  where Sandra is being subjected to various cruelties to assure her virtue  stays intact were sort of amusing, but other than that and some beautiful  scenery (and that fantastic theme song), I was pretty unimpressed. For  those people who like 50's architecture there is a great house towards the  end that is supposedly a Frank Lloyd Wright design.",947635200,6,649,4.504273504273504
118164,5,0790785366,"""A Summer Place"" is a movie that can be summed up with one word. HOT!  The story line is very compelling even by todays standards.  The one difference is that it leaves something to the imagination.  Though you  know that there is hanky panky going on, you are left to imagine what is  happening on the beach.  I think that this makes it more sexy than  explicite scenes.  A movie for those who remember when and their  grandchildren.",944956800,14,434,4.461538461538462
118165,5,0790785366,"As a teen growing up in Pacific Grove, Ca  I remember watching portions of the filming of this classic movie.

Can you  imagine my surprise to find my 16 year old daughter and her friends  watching this same movie 40 years later.  The scenery alone is worth the  viewing.",944611200,9,366,4.294117647058823
118166,5,0790785366,"It just does not get better than Troy Donahue and Sandra Dee!  This super cheesy story follows Dee's dad and Donahue's mom engaging in an extramarital affair, their subsequent divorces and their own marriage while  Dee and Donahue ""fall in love""  (oh and with Donahue's monotone  voice, there is just tons of passion...sarcasm!)  Dee gets pregnant, Johnny  wants to marry her (but, they are not 21!), and they end up reuniting with  their own newly  married parents who take them in and allow  them to get  married because  they ""live in a glass house [and] are not throwing  any stones"".  Scenes to watch for:  Dee's mom is evil!!!  Watch when  she slaps Dee...you actually see Dee purposely fall into the Christmas tree  to make the scene more dramamtic!  Also, the beach scene with Donahue  (looking mighty manly in a cardigan sweater only halfway buttoned with no  shirt and a pair of shorts) and Dee (equally well dressed with her straw  hat that has sunglasses permanently placed above the brim) as they exchange  such classically 50's dialogue as ""Johnny , I washed my hair for  you"" and ""Gee, Johnny, have you been bad with girls?""

I watched the trailer for the digital release and the SD quality was horrible, and the sound was bad so I was afraid to purchase that one. Then I found this 2007  DVD release and thought I would give it a try. I'm glad I did. Beautiful color and wonderful sound, even as a DVD on a Blu-ray player.

118185,4,0790785366,"An interesting manifesto of changing sexual mores, emotionally gratifying.
Presumably the parents of this generation taught their children to ""wait until marriage""
and to not care about chastity made you ""bad."" In this case, one parent of each
of the teenagers commit adultery and then divorce their spouses with no regret or guilt,
agreeing that love is the only chance of happiness in this life. However, this could make them
hypocrites in the eyes of their children, and its questionable how the kids will now judge them.
Then, in the critical scene, Sandra and Troy give in to the idea that so long as they love one another,
it isn't ""bad"" to make love and she becomes pregnant. So they briefly become fugitives from their parents and the law,
but they prove themselves ""good"" by marrying and the film ends with them ready to take on a
new generation with what they have learned. So, both the older and the younger generation act with
imperfect integrity, but Love wins out in the end. Strong performances, totally engaging, sympathetic to the young.",1498953600,,1054,4.828729281767956

118196,2,0790785366,"Ugh. The women in this movie are basically caricatures. You'll notice the ""good"" women (the women the audience is supposed to like) are shot beautifully, always sexually available to the men (as all women should be, the movie tells you) and also always soft spoken and obedient to their men. The woman you are not supposed to like is shot about a step removed from wearing actual devil horns on her head during her scenes. She is  lit badly and given terrible dialogue and is, of course, a prude. Because women who have opinions are also women who can't satisfy men sexually and, as we all know from the movie, women are supposed to be good, quiet, obedient, and ready for sex at all times.

Non-thinking people will tout this movie as ""revolutionary"" because they can't see beyond on the ""Ahmagherds people are having premarital sex!"" Oh, please. The movie is given a ridiculous Hollywood ending where everything works out great for the women who have sex outside marriage all while existing in the real world where women of the 1950s/60s were often abandoned by men after acquiescing to their sexual demands, driven to illegal abortions or secret adoptions of the children conceived out of wedlock, or stuck trying to raise children alone after being discarded by the man they thought loved them.

It's ridiculous, frankly.

You can almost picture the director sitting alone in a darkened theater watching Sandra Dee over and over while telling himself that's how women ought to be. Gross.",1491868800,,1491,4.858267716535433

which launched the careers of Sandra Dee and Troy Donahue.  The film was based on a best seller about two adults' love affair and couple of young teenagers' romance.  The main story was on Richard Egan and Dorothy McGuire, the teenagers' respective parents.  The young lovers were the supporting characters.  At the time the film was first released, the storyline was a bit of a shocker and controversial.  50 years on, it became rather tame.  The film was well-made, well-directed and acted, especially by the two adult leads.  The quality of the DVD is acceptable.",1467936000,3,715,4.664

Ford as Sandra's mother is brilliant as a monster on the loose.) It's amazing it passed the censorship bureau at the time.

There is also the famous theme from A Summer Place, a piece Max Steiner threw in for the rose garden scene with Troy and Sandra. Warner heard it and had Steiner scrap the opening credit music theme, to be used for the rest of the film, and incorporate the famous theme.
Fabulous scenery, although not Maine, and a kind of lingering darkness at the close as everyone tries to sort out what happened. WE know those ba people are still out there, and many more like them. The final shot in the film, no background of any note, except that it is grey.

A must!!

118318,1,0790785366,"The characters in this film are all overly caricatured and it's just too hard to believe or even suspend disbelief for the sake of ""art.""

For instance, there are at least two separate occasions when Molly talks to her father about undressing in front of her window back at home so a neighbor boy can see her and is also having ""naughty dreams."" Talking about this with your father? Really? And her father responds by saying that it's ""natural"" and that ""our sole reason in life is to love and be loved."" And that is the message that is played over and over in the film. But love is equated with sex.

If love is equated with sex, then Molly's mother is the opposite of love (according to the film). She's obsessed with sex, but in a different way in that she finds it dirty. Her character is just so grossly caricatured, it's painful to even watch.

Molly's father Ken, had a past relationship with Johnny's mother Sylvia when they were much younger. Sylvia turned him down though because he didn't have any money. Instead she married the heir to the island's resort and Johnny's father, Bart, but they have recently fallen on ""hard times"" financially. Bart is also a gross caricaturization of a rude alcohol binging husband.

How convenient then that Ken and Sylvia cross paths again and how even more convenient that he happens to be a millionaire. They ""follow their hearts"" and leave their prospective spouses and I guess live happily ever after?

Both Johnny and Molly follow their parents' advice to also ""follow their hearts"" and Molly ends up becoming pregnant and they get married. Ken initially responds with indignation in hearing of Molly's pregnancy, but in the end they reconcile with one another. He realized that he only told Molly to ""follow her heart"" as he did. It's completely obvious that Hollywood was trying to push the ""follow your heart"" mantra in this film and I find it to make for a weak and lacking story.",1427155200,3,1935,4.6627565982404695

118357,5,0790785366,"What can one say about this film. I consider this Delmer Daves' masterpiece. It was the first of four productions that teamed Daves and Troy Donahue (Parrish, Susan Slade and Rome Adventure followed). Troy Donahue was never noted for any great acting prowess, but he did represent the last breed of the innocent clean-cut naive teenager. This was Donahue's strong point and Daves used that persona expertly and effectively to extract the longing for the eternal youthful spirit in all of us. That is why this film is so viewable to this day. To paraphrase Richard Egan's character in the film: Our only purpose is to love and be loved. That is what this film is all about. Visually it is breathtakingly and lushly photographed by Harry Stradling. The dialog is juxtaposed between crisp witty cynicism at times and then beautiful tender passages of poetic expressions of love. The Max Steiner score and love theme have become interwoven into our everyday society as effectively as they mirrored the emotions of the characters in this film. The story at its most basic level is one of adultery and teenage love canvassed on an island on the Maine coast. However, the motivations and the ramifications of the characters' actions run much deeper. The expert cast includes Richard Egan, Dorothy McGuire, Sandra Dee, Constance Ford, Beulah Bondi and the actors' actor Arthur Kennedy. This film was based on the Sloan Wilson novel. This is one of my favorite films. I highly recommend it. The DVD copy is very good.",1414627200,2,1508,4.89453125

118386,5,0790785366,"I was a teenager when this movie was made, and as most teens, I related to the ""teen"" portion of this movie.  There is an adult part to this story interweaved interestingly well; the story of the affair of parents played by Richard Egan (also my heart throb) and Dorothy McGuire.  Troy Donahue plays the son of a financially struggling family who owns a Bread and Breakfast (McGuire & Arthur Kennedy).  Sandra Dee plays the teen daughter of the family coming back to the island for a vacation.  Sandra's father use to be a life guard at the island AND was once in love with Troy's mother when they were younger.  Both of the other spouses suspect their marriage is in jeopardy when this reunion unfolds, but the story gets even deeper when their children, Sandra and Troy, develop an affair - and Sandra gets pregnant.  Both sets of parents wind up getting divorced and to the teens surprise, Sandra's father and Troy's mother marry each other.  Talk about a melodramatic soap opera at it's best.  The theme song is a masterpiece, ""A Summer Place"" by Max Steiner - and will forever ring it's melody in my head.  Hmmm, I think I'll watch it tonight!",1402272000,4,1148,4.560975609756097

118389,5,0790785366,"Growing up in Germany, I knew that this film exists, but it was not on German TV before the late 1990's. Such a shame!
I read the novel by Sloan Wilson many times in the 70's and 80's and was always guessing if the movie would be as good as the novel? It turned out to be even better.

As a collector of Sandra Dee movies this is my favorite Dee film followed by ""Portrait in Black"" (with Lana Turner, almost like a Hitchcock thriller) and ""If a Man answers"" (with Bobby Darin), a very cute comedy for Valentine's Day.
It's also based on a good novel, written by Winifred Wolfe.

Compared with the other wonderful Delmer Daves dramas from the 50's this is definitely my favorite movie with ""Susan Slade"" following closely.

Recently I found out that movie fans can actually participate in a movie bus tour which includes a few locations from ""A Summer Place"".

118394,3,0790785366,"SO dated now, and VERY much TOO long!

This is one of those movies that must be watched with the social conventions of the late 50's very much in mind.
The situations portrayed were considered extremely delicate then, but most of them now seem quite mundane.
Extra-marital sex? Frigidity?  Divorce? Sex before marriage? Teenage sex? Teenage pregnancy?

Well if you watch any movies nowadays you'll already know those topics have become more than just a little ""ho-hum"".
They appear regularly in TV soaps!

Anyway, here it is 1959 and they are BIG issues, specially as this movie tries so hard to NOT make moral judgements, but the message is there just the same.
Troy Donahue is the resident pretty-boy here, again in his signature red sweater and white pants that apparently set off a gay fashion mania in the early 60's.
Dorothy Malone gives probably the best performance. She later made a career out of playing women who were willing to go beyond the moral codes of the time.
Constance Ford gets to chew up the scenery as the frigid and sexually repressed mother of Sandra Dee.
It's a great part and she is of course cast as the villain, but provides the voice of current morality of the time against which everything else rebels.
Her husband Richard Egan is suitably macho and adores his ""little girl princess"" Sandra Dee.

Now Ms Dee is one of those frothy little actresses that manages to ALWAYS play....well, ....Ms Dee actually.
She so constantly just seems to spend the whole movie pouting those bee-stung lips and pondering whether to be ""good"", (that's the euphemism they use here too), or go-all-the-way with some boy, ...which she so rarely does.
(I find her extremely irritating, but others may beg to differ.)

The drawn out scenes where Ms Dee and lover boy Troy Donahue, (who's far prettier than herself BTW), discuss and re-discuss, debate and consider, then re-consider whether or not to ""do it"" seem interminable to the modern viewer now.
I was literally yelling ""Oh just get it on will ya!""

An inordinate amount of screen time is devoted to this vacillating , but I assume that this was THE big issue back then.
(I began to think Troy would have had much better luck and far less fuss getting his rocks off down at the local gay bar, ...but homosexuality is probably to one big issue this movie does not try to tackle.)

EVENTUALLY, .....after much yes we will, no we won't, maybe we will, better not, you don't really want to, yes I think I do etc.......guess what? THEY DO IT!!! They are just SO MUCH in LURVE!!!!!

Of course it's not shown on screen, ....just those ubiquitous crashing waves to suggest the unleashed passion that told us all back then that some pretty racy sex was going on somewhere off-screen!

And of course, being the 50's, you know there just has to be ...wait for it! CONSEQUENCES!!!
Despite Troy-boy being at least 27 and going to an all male college he knows nothing of contraception and yes, you guessed it, ...Ms Dee gets up-the-duff!!! OOH-WAH!!!! This is just what happens when good girls go bad, tsk-tsk!

More bedroom moralising from all concerned, but don't worry, they get married in the end and morality is preserved.

Now in this long, long narrative there are more than a few holes.
Dorothy Malone's character wants a divorce from her drunken, no-good useless husband to marry the heroic Richard Egan, ...(they used to be lovers back when he had no money), but the drunk prevents the divorce by saying he will not grant Dorothy custody of Troy!
""Custody""???
Troy Donahue just has to be at least in his mid-twenties, ...certainly old enough to NOT be awarded in custody!
Yet this threat works?
The lack of taking ""precautions"" seems very much a ""plot device"" considering the prevalence of condoms back then, ... and the apparent worldliness of Donahue's character.
The dreaded word ""abortion"" is of course never mentioned here.
This is ""made-in America"" folks, and I imagine they didn't want the theatre bombed and staff shot dead on the sidewalk by bible-belt vigilantes.

There are NO black people at all, ..which seemed odd to me.
Very much a ""whites only"" movie.

A house by Frank Lloyd Wright gets screen mention and it's situated right on the ocean, ...and I mean right on the water's edge.
Wonder if it's still there today with oceans rising and the occasional cyclones?

The astute eye will detect the roof is already rusting in several places, but the architect's much vaunted use of glass provides the corny non-judgemental line for Dorothy Malone who says without a trace of self-consciousness:
""We live in a glass house so we are not throwing stones...""
You just know ""all will be well"" after that corker!
I'd like to re-visit a year or two down the track and see if Ms Dee is still smiling, surrounded by diapers and waiting for Troy to come home from that cute little bar down the road?

(Apologies if the excessive capitalisation offends anyone's sensibilities here, ..as you will no doubt realise I'm being a bit tongue-in-cheek, it's done to ensure emphasis is read where I intend it to be.)",1397174400,,5068,4.748577929465301

118397,5,0790785366,"Many viewers today will consider this movie hokey and nave with the dialog using terms like ""being bad"" for sexual activity. But this movie was brave for its time to even approach the subject of adultery and teen pregnancy. These subjects were not frequently addressed during that time. Sandra Dee and Troy Donahue never won awards for great acting but they were stars at the time and brought in the audience of teenagers. I can envision if they rated movies back then it would have gotten an R for adult content. But putting it beside the stuff that passes for movies today, it would be closer to PG. No bad language, no violence other than Molly's mother slapping her, and no explicit sex since everything was implied rather than shown. The other thing that must be noted about this movie is the incredibly beautiful music, especially the Theme from A Summer Place which even today is played in commercials. It is without a doubt one of the most beautiful movie themes of all time.",1395964800,2,983,4.655172413793103

118419,4,0790785366,"I was 54 years late, but I finally got around to watching this well-known soap opera. Released in 1959, the story has to do with a couple (Arthur Kennedy and Dorothy McGuire) who own a vacation inn off the coast of Maine. It's a beautiful old mansion but they're barely above poverty and Kennedy's a sad alcoholic. That's when an affluent couple visits for the summer (Richard Egan and Constance Ford). Egan was a lifeguard on the island when he was a teen and knows the couple from his youth. He and McGuire dated back then and Egan wants to reignite the flame, likely because his wife is utterly frigid. On top of this, both couples have teens (Troy Donahue and Sandra Dee) and they strike up a secret romance as well. There are drastic consequences to these liaisons.

What separates this film from a television soap opera is the location shooting. I should point out, however, that it was shot on the coast of California, not Maine (Pacific Grove and Carmel-by-the-Sea).

""A Summer Place"" is a worthwhile film because, watching it, is like going back in time where mores were more reserved and much less hedonistic. A girl wasn't expected to have sex until she married and, if she did, it was scandalous. It was the same thing with adultery, which still is scandalous, but even more so back then. It's also interesting to see how people dressed while lounging around the house, all dressed-up. Despite the differing mores, people are still human and face the same human needs and temptations that people do in any time period.

The social dynamics are also interesting: It's wrong for Richard and Dorothy to  commit adultery, but who can blame them in the face of Constance' cold legalism and Arthur's pathetic alcoholism? Constance seethingly condemns Dorothy as a monstrous adulterous, but she's oblivious to her own loveless arrogance. Which is the greater transgression? Would Richard have strayed in the first place if Constance wasn't such an impassive ice queen? And without Richard's advances Dorothy would've never been tempted to cheat on Arthur. O what a tangled web we weave.

The first half is great for the reasons cited above, including the gorgeous locations, but the second half moves away from the island and focuses on the relationship of Donahue and Dee, which simply isn't as interesting as the adult entanglements. Thankfully, the story picks up in the final act and the core message rings loud and clear: love conquers all (and I'm not talkin' bout mere physical lust).

The film runs 130 minutes and is overlong by about 10-20 minutes, but it's an interesting period piece with some fascinating gems to extract, not to mention the beautiful coastal locations.",1385596800,2,2687,4.868708971553611

118459,4,0790785366,"I was a small child when this film came out, so this 1950's world is somewhat familiar to me.  I feel as if I can still hear echoes of it, as the musical theme for Summer Place was played every year as the procession for one of the functions at my high school.

It is also amusing to hear some of the funny expressions that crop up in the dialogue of this movie. The teenage lovers Johnny and Molly have to endure such things as Johnny's father referring to Molly as ""a succulent wench.""  As for Johnny, he criticizes his father as ""supercilious""--a word that you would not normally expect to hear out of the mouth of a teenager in a heated argument with one of his parents!

Another interesting reference that crops up in this movie is the finishing school ""Briarwood"" that Molly attends while Johnny is going to an all-male college in Virginia--an obvious (as well as both insulting and misleading) reference to the prestigious and rigorous Virginia woman's college Sweet Briar.  I was astonished to find that Johnny and his fellow college students all wore suits and ties to class--a practice completely different from that of the T-shirt and jeans world that I knew as a college student in the early 1970s!

My favorite part of the movie is the beautiful house built by Frank Lloyd Wright in which Johnny's father resides--a house that is actually situated in Carmel CA.",1368144000,3,1374,4.633744855967078

It's one of the first to use an adorable teenage girl (Sandra Dee) who every girl wanted to be in a role where she defied her well-meaning but naive parents and went ""all the way.""  After this movie came out, we teen girls talked of nothing else at slumber parties and school lunches.  Unlike real life, the pregnant girl ended up with the hunky guy, and attitudes began to change among teenage girls.  I know because I was there.  Sadly, not all girls ended up with the guy like Sandra Dee's character, but the number of ""shotgun weddings"" increased in our small town after this movie and a few others of the same ilk (""Splender in the Grass,"" ""Payton Place,"" and ""Return to Payton Place"") came out.  Most sociolgists cite the introduction of the pill as changing sexual mores, but it was the movies.  By the time the pill came out, attitudes had already changed.

I've had been waiting for it to be put onto DVD, and then forgot about it, until Turner Classic Movies had it on one day.....I only got to see the last 10 minutes of the movie....but immediately came on line and ordered it.
The DVD is spectacular in it's sound and picture quality.  The colors put you right there, on Pine Island, with the characters.  A powerful love story, about two 17 year old teenagers, finding themselves and each other....while dealing with the emotions of falling in love, while becoming a man and a woman.  It is beautifully done, and makes me rememember when..lol.
The love story of reunited love, with Johnny's mother, and Molly's father, is a beautifully done love story, of refinding love lost.  It is so well done, that I could feel the emotions of the characters....even Molly's frigid, hatefilled mother.
This film should be shown to High School students, it identifies WITH them and what they feel....and would help teenagers to understand the consequences of ""rash"" actions, and how those actions will change your life, forever.

The plot was so convoluted and ridiculous that it was downright funny.  In the end, did all your reviewers who gave this ""masterpiece"" of unintended fun 3 stars and above realize that a brother married his sister and vice versa (well, yes, they are step-brother and step-sister). Still, that's funny!  If you like overacting, bad dialogue, terrible plotting, over the top melodrama, you will love this movie.

I thought it was beautifully filmed and very well done. The use of good actors in the adult roles makes a big difference. The two young people are so true to life for that age. Messed up by their parents and just holding onto each other when their world is turned upside down. It didn't paint things to be sweeter than they were in order to make a glamorous movie. It's a good story, well told, well acted and the ending, while happy, is believable. It leaves one thinking ""well, good luck kids"".

118499,4,0790785366,"Parents'marital jealousy and infidelity threaten the romance of two young lovers in Delmer Daves' lush adaptation of Sloan Wilson's popular novel. Beautifully filmed on location,this is big-budget '50s soap opera at its best. Daves and his team skillfully bring the novel to life,so what could have been pure trash turns out to be a surprisingly strong and moving film.
Harry Stradling's lovely photography and Max Steiner's beautiful score(including one of the loveliest and most memorable love themes in movie history)help enormously. The performances are excellent,with Richard Egan,Dorothy McGuire,Arthur Kennedy,Sandra Dee,and Troy Donahue all in top form.

Sandra Dee and Troy Donahue, the reigning clean-cut teen idols of the time are star-crossed lovers Molly and Johnny. Richard Egan and Dorothy Maguire play Molly's Dad and Johnny's Mom respectively, who were star-crossed lovers in their youth - both (for the wrong reasons) marrying Molly's Mom and Johnny's Dad, respectively. Marriages that are as ""on the rocks"" as they could be. What transpires is as scandalous as movies could get for the period. All actors are adequate for their roles, if not one-dimensional. However it is Arthur Kennedy who brings great depth and layered insight into his role as Johnny's inebriate father. Kennedy was both a highly intelligent and gifted actor, and certainly underrated. His final scene when Johnny returns to the ""Summer Place"" is inspired. Picture quality is outstanding. 1:85 Anamorphic widescreen.",1290038400,5,944,5.258278145695364

It is supposed to be the New England Coast but it is in reality Monterey CA. This film is at times camp but the film is a monument to the social mores and naivet of America in the late 50's and early 60's. Summer Place had one the most beautiful theme songs ever made for a film made famous by the Percy Faith Orchestra that did 2 other versions of "" Theme From a  Summer Place"". Faith re-recorded the song twice - first, in 1969, as a female choral version, then, in 1976, as a terrible disco version titled ""Summer Place 76"".",1280707200,,632,4.223140495867769
118520,5,0790785366,"I saw this movie when I was a in  my early teens, and I didn't really understand it then, now in my 40's and seeing it from an adult's perspective - it blew me away!

Interesting how candid this movie was, considering the time frame it was set in, and the issues surrounding pre-marital sex i.e. fornication back then, especially with the impetus or demands placed on marriage for society's sake. Moreover, what was surprising was the embarrassment surrounding the young teens' dilemma; their initial fear, decisions, and responsibilities regarding unexpected pregnancy; education, trying to do the right thing by deciding to wed, only to be turned away by the Justice of Peace because they were underage.

What's more, is the sad turn of events regarding both their parents' subsequent union and adulterous affairs, alcoholism, the young girl being disowned by her mother because of her inappropriate actions, and the scandal that followed.

This movie had me enthralled and shocked when the mother decides to have a doctor examine her daughter to find out whether or not she was sexually active. I was aghast!

Fantastic acting, gripping story-line, amazing directing, exposing the lifestyles of the wealthy in the 50's. This movie could have easily been about impoverished kids from dysfunctional families rocked by fornication, teenage pregnancy, adultery, alcoholism. Identical theme; different environment. I imagine a film like this back then would have met with loud gasps, and embarrassing feminine swoonings. Dirty stories must be kept hushed, so I'm cheering loudly for this brave expos! Two thumbs up!!

Sandra Dee and Troy Donahue were absolutely the best characters for these roles. Their acting was superb! This a MUST-SEE movie! Absolutely BRILLIANT!! FIVE stars!",1279584000,4,1779,5.290780141843972
118521,5,0790785366,"I watched this movie when I was 16 back in 1986, on TBS, and even with the dreaded commercial breaks I was riveted throughout.
Johnny's parents own an Inn that has fallen into some hard times, and Molly's parents are arriving to stay the summer. Johnny's mom used to have a thing with Molly's dad back in the day, no spoilers here because you can feel the sexual tension from the word go. Meanwhile Molly and Johnny also seem to be hitting it off. Of course Johnny's dad is a drunk and Molly's mom is a frigid b**ch. Sparks and words fly between everyone. Let's just say this is melodrama at it's best. I won't go into more detail so you can enjoy it for the first time.
I find it sad that Troy Donahue never really was considered a good actor, granted he was no James Dean or Monty Clift but he could hold his own when given a good part as in this movie. Sandra Dee, what can I say? She was a sweet- heart in every sense of the word. Richard Egan and Dorothy McGuire are incredible as the star crossed lovers, the scene with them talking in the attic after he fixes the roof is brimming with sexual tension.
For a movie that is filled with adultery and secret rendezvous' there is very little actual sex on screen, well as a matter of fact there is no sex on screen what so ever, couples even have twin beds in their rooms. Oh, those crazy 50's censors. But I kind of like it this way, you imagine everything and there is more time for actual dialogue, that wonderful 50's taboo dialogue : ""I have naughty thoughts"" ""We're in 'trouble' "" ""You harlot"" and my all time favorite: ""Have you been bad Johnny?

118549,4,0790785366,"This film, from my birth year, I knew only as hearsay, as a Monterey/Carmel tourguide.  In fact, I even would point out the wrong house on the 17-Mile-Drive as a Warner Brothers' property where it was filmed, and my (mostly older) tourists would cry out, ""Oh, wow!""  The themesong I had on CD, playing it for that part of the drive between Bird Rock and the gate to Pacific Grove.  Yes, for years I have done all this, yet never bothered to look for the film.

Finally, now that I am laid up with an Achilles tendon rupture, out of work for weeks, I asked my brother, who was often at the library, could he bring me some DVD's, anything, I am so bored at home and can't go out, can't drive, etc.  So he picked this one out because he thought it looked ""racy"", like some kind of beach party with Annette Funicello.

Lo and behold, the front cover is false - yes, it is about teenage love and lust, but it is more about adultery and the incredibly difficult bind young wannabe-lovers face:  they have no money, haven't even finished school, and cannot marry so young, but they cannot resist their libidos, wind up pregnant and have to get married.  Meanwhile, Wilson Sloan, the novel writer behind the script, pushes the rationale for this ill-advised shotgun wedding through the life stories of these kids' miserable parents:  the boy's mother and the girl's father had been in love in their teenhood, in the same Pine Inn, 20 years earlier, yet because of class differences - back to money again - could not marry.

I may be getting old, but I see the father, Richard Egan as the heartthrob in this movie, who seems very cozy physically with his ""harlot"" daughter (as her mother would call her).  He's rugged, handsome, well-built, rich, educated (research chemist), willing and able (fixes roof leaks in storms), polite, tolerant, kind-hearted, and even sympathetic with his frigid and bitter wife.  Apparently some women, older than me, tell me that that was the case, not the young studmuffin, our girl's teenage lover.

This is a feel-good, Happy-End film, where teenage pregnancy is accepted in the end and a shotgun marriage allowed by the wealthy and tolerant father, newly married to the boy's mother.  But in reality, most people could never let their kids marry so young without a disaster financially, so often girls were ""disappeared"" to ""maternity homes"", where the babies were put up for adoption, and several lives at least were made miserable.  Most illegitimate children became stigmatized, unlike today, so a boy and girl were much more afraid of the consequences.

Several questions in this film came up for me:

Did neither of these savvy young people hear of condoms?  Esp. the boy, already away at college with other lusty boys?

Did no one consider that perhaps the girl's mother was so cynical and bitter because she had become a mother?  That it was difficult and sad, and that she wanted to spare her daughter from it as long as possible?  In other words, it wasn't sex that scared her, but pregnancy and the long, hard road called ""raising a child"".  Also, wouldn't then a viewer consider, this luscious morsel (SAndra Dee) become just like her mother, esp. by having a child so early in life, unmarried to boot, no high school diploma, no fun, no dances, no football games, etc?  WOuld she not become just as bitter as her mother, realizing her young life had stopped?
No doubt the boy would be financed to go back to college and continue his freedom there, while she would be home for years, bored and lonely, with a baby, unable to be with young friends.  No one here in these reviews mentions these realities as a main reason a MOTHER would protect her daughter from any possibility of early pregnancy and illegitimate kids; some boys DO NOT STICK AROUND!  Then try finding a husband later, with a ""B******d"" you have to raise alone!  Girls and their parents were very, very, very, VERY afraid of such consequences.

Notice that Dorothy McGuire and Arthur Kennedy, mother and father of the boy, do not reprimand him for his possible sexual dalliance in the boat/overnight camping incident.  No one thinks him a fool, wrong, etc., and no one asks if he used protection, to avoid a shotgun marriage.  It really all did come down on the girl in 1959, and yes, it was still like that in my high school in the 1970's, granted, it was a girls' CAtholic high school.  Yes, one girl disappeared, Karen S. in sophomore year, off to Germany to have a kid.  The rest of us found out and were terrified.
We knew it meant no chance for college, for a career or even for fun.  I knew it meant financial ruin and no chance to travel abroad, my big dream.
We also knew that a child had to be supported, that work/slavery and money worries would eat up our lives if we married too young - for we were not the rich kids in this film.

I think this film tries very hard to show that love should triumph, and yes, one always hopes for it, esp. when young.  But an older eye, an eye jaded through years of working and seeing life's hardships, sees that the young people do not realize the hell that they're about to enter too soon.  The boy's drunken father tells him to forget the whole think, for ""in vino veritas"".  He speaks to his son while quite drunk, but the message is the same for the girl, who listens outside.  He is warning them that they are throwing away their youth, their young freedom.  Surely this point of view could not be lost on them entirely?  Sandra Dee, in soft light, tells him that he has forgotten one thing, ""Love"".  Apparently, she's banking on someone else to pay the ""bills"", something she doesn't mention, having never known poverty or even one job yet.
Meanwhile, the boy knows his parents' Pine Inn is in ruins, can bring no income without the money to fix the old broken-down property; he was raised on penny-pinching and is no fool.  Is he banking on the girl's father, so he has no fear of his financial future with a baby?

I loved the film's location, down on the rocky beaches of the 17-Mile-Drive, where no one in his right mind goes out in the water.  If you even climb out on those rocks, as honeymooners do for photos, then chances of slipping and drowning in the undertow are high.  But never mind!  Great evocation of old, leisurely, upper-class vacations on the Maine Coast!

Sandra Dee was beautiful and did an excellant job as the confused daughter of a loveless marriage.  Troy Donahue was eye candy for all the young females fans and held up his part as the lovelorn teen caught between loyalty to family and teenage angst.  Arthur Kennedy was superb as the drunken father and played the part to perfection.  Richard Egan and and Dorthy McGuire played the reunited lovers well without going overboard and Constance Ford was perfect as the woman we all loved to hate.  Yes this is a 1950's soap opera brought to th screen and did depart from Sloan Wilson's novel in minor ways, but all does end for the best. So to all of you who were too busy with prom and dating when this movie was released buy and enjoy a trip to yester-year.

The color and cinematography are outstanding for 1959 and

Sandra Dee and Troy Donahue have always been my favorites,
and the rest of the cast is made up of some of Hollywood's
best at that time; each part cast and played to perfection.

What I'd like to know is how in 1959 could Hollywood make a
great film like this with beautiful background music that
DID NOT drown out the dialogue and they can't do it today?
In today's movies, all you hear is booming music and
ear-splitting special effects sounds while the dialogue is
barely audible.

Hats off to the late Delmer Daves for writing and
directing so many great movies of that era, and also to
the late Max Steiner for the beautiful original
musical score.

118553,4,0790785366,"A classic trip down memory lane with lotsa eye candy thrown in (with the likes of Troy Donahue and Sandra Dee). Lines are at times a little laboured, but the idyllic setting of sand, sea, boats (and a boat house) on an island holiday resort should appeal to the die-hard romantics (viz. the ladies).

What was daring for the time was the outright depiction of 2 strained marriages, the myriad variations of steamy love affairs (adolescent lovers who part, mature adults who find that they cannot deny their love for each other inspite of duty/devotion to their college-age children and the twinge of guilt-ridden obbligation to their dysfunctional spouses, giddy teen-age love with enforced separation, reunion and all their possible consequences...)

Does being good mean not having sex out of marriage even if the couple love each other? It is a moral dilemma that goes on even till this day....
it is hard to berate any of the lovers when the love and passion they share seem so true...but love does not easily conquer all ... and the costs and consequences of being true to one's passion irregardless of everyone and everything else are clear for all to see ...
from the simple wedding scene with the couple's children and friends clearly and noticeably absent to the desperate fugitive young couple
trying to cling together in the face of having an illegitimate child.",1202515200,4,1373,4.888412017167382

118559,4,0790785366,"The theme of ""A Summer Place,"" especially when crooned by The Lettermen, has the ability to conjure up images of beaches and sailboats even in the depths of winter. Schmaltzy but pleasing, it perfectly suits a movie which at first glance is the soapiest of soap operas. The 1959 film, based upon the torrid novel of Sloan Wilson, was scandalous because of the topics of adolescent fornication and pregnancy in an era when teenagers were supposed to be innocent. Set in New England, for the most part, ""A Summer Place"" debuted in the cinema as Calvinist America stood on the brink of cultural and sexual revolution. The book even more than the movie shows the reaction of the new generation to the Manichean attitudes which tended to flow as an undercurrent in American society. Puritanical repression is as different from genuine purity as ice is from fire; when sexuality is rejected because it is considered dirty or unclean, rather than restrained for the sake of love, then a monster is unleashed.

As the Richard Egan character reacts against his wife's disdain of the marriage bed by rekindling passion with his lost love (Dorothy McGuire), two families are ruined and all hell breaks loose. When the adults break the rules, they open up the way for the adolescents to break them, too. And while the grown-ups are able to piece their lives back together again, the youngsters are nearly destroyed. It is one of the films which best show the effects of divorce and remarriage upon the children involved. In the light of the confusion and torment suffered by the two teenagers, played by Sandra Dee and Troy Donahue, the affair embarked upon by Egan and McGuire appears irresponsible rather than romantic, although one cannot help but pity them for their impossible marriages. When people break commitments in order to find happiness and fulfillment, they must be aware of the high price to be paid, and the one to pay it might very probably be an innocent child.",1188345600,,1967,4.836795252225519

My beef is with Warner Brothers; regarding the print.  I have ordered a lot of product from Amazon; both in CD's and DVD's and this is the first that came with a flawed picture.  NOT Amazon's fault.

On the upper left hand part of the screen you sometimes see what is a red X.  Looks like fluff or dirt.  Then you see (I think) more dirt.  This time like a green piece of fluff on the lens.

118565,5,0790785366,"As a social barometer of the times it may be reading a bit too much into ""A Summer Place"" to proclaim it as an early ripple in the social tempests still to come in the 1960's.  Still those of us alive at that time know that in 1959 it WAS controversial to sympathetically portray adultery and teen sexuality as depicted in ""A Summer Place"".  I remember my high school years (early '70's) and how girls who ""got into trouble"" would simply disappear and you'd never know what became of them until a classmate told you years later of their waywardness (this was still a VERY rare occurrence here in ""flyover country"" even then; unfortunately this is not nearly so uncommon now). And of course while adultery and divorce were likewise not quite so prevalent ""back in the day,"" they certainly happened but not without considerable burden of stigma for the convention-defying lovers who tossed everything over for their passion.

So yeah, I do think the sociology of ""A Summer Place"" is significant but that's really the least reason to see it.  Mostly it's just maximum guilty-pleasure FUN and a HUGE blast of '50's nostalgia and ""attitude"" that still has great charm and luster for receptive movie fans.

Rule number 1 is that you must have full tolerance for what we could now call cheesy acting and intensely overripe melodrama.  AND ALSO you must be prepared for the nearly day-glo full-frontal gumball-vivid Technicolor cinematography of the time.  Too many viewers can't see beyond the stylistic conventions of the time a movie was made to appreciate the human story being told; what a pity!  Think of everyone you know who just won't watch a movie because it's in black & white, or because it's obviously an old, overcooked Hollywood potboiler.  You know what?  Many of those are GREAT works of art however (like most art) they require that you make the effort to meet them halfway.  Think of them not only as theatrical productions but also as time capsules of the era they were created--because that's exactly what they are.  And how fortunate we are now to have such easy access on DVD for our enjoyment now!

But enough of the film theory stuff.  ""A Summer Place"" appeals on many levels; the gorgeous cinematography, the convention-challenging story & script, the VERY effective and well-remembered orchestral score, and let's not overlook the cast.  Sandra Dee & Troy Donahue do indeed project a kind of youthful innocence that truly is a thing of the past now, but was common in their time.  Dorothy McGuire & Richard Egan give it their all as the reunited Pine Island lovers who cannot resign themselves to half-lives of marital indifference or cruelty.  And how about those jilted spouses?  You gotta love Constance Ford as the scheming, affronted and passive-aggressive wife interested mostly in keeping her husband & daughter under her thumb.  Look-the DVD transfer shows how she has make-up ""frown lines"" painted at the corners of her mouth just in case we don't get the point that she's a sullen, PO'd, bitter woman.  A Snidely Whiplash mustache wouldn't have been gender-appropriate, would it?!?  Arthur Kennedy also gives a GREAT performance as Dorothy's bibulous husband who despite his degraded state still musters considerable self-awareness & ultimately inspires our sympathy.

I described ""A Summer Place"" earlier as a guilty pleasure, but now I want to back off a little bit in closing.  This is not really drama that will shake you fiercely like, say ""21 Grams"" or ""Dead Man Walking,"" however I confess I AM touched by the underlying sincerity of ""A Summer Place"" and its intent to provoke--gently--some questioning of the Eisenhower era values that seemed set in stone and indeed WERE a cage of oppression for many. Perhaps your appreciation of ""A Summer Place"" will be proportional to your level of receptivity to such a re-evaluation.  All I know for sure is that you enjoy it half as much as I do, you will like it a very great deal indeed!

ADDENDUM 4/11/12: ""Summer Place"" remains a huge favorite, and I've gone on to enjoy Delmer Daves' other Troy Donahue movies (nicely bundled in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Warner-Bros-Romance-Classics-Collection-Palm-Springs-Weekend-Parrish-Rome-Adventure-Susan-Slade/dp/B001HSNTKW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Warner Bros. Romance Classics Collection (Palm Springs Weekend / Parrish / Rome Adventure / Susan Slade)</a>), but ""Summer Place"" is still INDISPUTABLY the best.  Blu ray would certainly be the next frontier for ""SP"", and I admit I'm hoping they take some time to add some meaningful extras--and a good modern COMMENTARY track would likewise greatly add some perspective and ""back-story"" to the experience.  (The DVD is sure way better than nothing--still highly recommended--but it has NO extras at all.)

I still think ""Summer Place"" is an important pop culture expression of the changing social attitudes and mores of the late '50's-early '60's, reflecting how all generations were questioning what life ""expected"" of them versus the gravity of their own yearnings.  And as such it's definitely worthy of a little ""deluxe edition"" re-issue love!  Come on WB--Make me buy ""Summer Place"" again!

118567,4,0790785366,"Nowadays novelist Sloan Wilson's a nearly-forgotten footnote to 50's pop culture, but he produced two big bestsellers that were made into iconic films of their time, THE MAN IN THE GREY FLANNEL SUIT and A SUMMER PLACE.  Neither picture's a masterpiece, but both are of interest, with SUMMER PLACE having the edge for entertainment value; its tale of angst and lust, senior and junior division, still provides plenty of sizzle.  Thanks to the production code, Hollywood danced around sex for years.  When films began to address the subject, in pictures like PEYTON PLACE and A SUMMER PLACE, the tone was often breathless hysteria -- there's something of a disconnect when actors coiffed and dressed in high 50's fashion are tossing around Victorian language like ""house of ill repute"" and ""harlot"".  That said, these movies provide fascinating glimpses of public morality.  In today's climate, Paris Hilton's X-rated antics provoke less commotion than Wilson's relatively straightforward adultery and teenage canoodling do here.  Attractive performances from Egan and McGuire, nice work from Constance Ford as the embittered, puritanical mother (Angela Lansbury must have been washing her hair that week), and career-defining turns from Troy Donahue and Sandra Dee.  As I've said before on this site, Dee's always better than you remember her being.  She looks fine here, maintaining her dignity in a thoughtful performance of material that could easily have turned ludicrous.

While most viewers are rightly intrigued by the lush Max Steiner score, the shimmer and youth of Sandra Dee and Troy Donohue and the beautiful, rocky scenery of Maine coast line, the real treasure hidden in this film are the dialogue and breathtaking performances of Richard Egan and Dorothy McGuire.

Only to disquietingly narrow minds might the dialogue and issues seem dated, namely those who lean to imagining themselves to be holders of liberal views but who are, in practice, rather inept when it comes to understanding or appreciating the experience of other generations and other cultures. Such a view, however, couldn't miss the point more. ""We have to make choices,"" says Egan. For a generation of westerners that have ""everything""--no war on the homefront, good health, internet, democracy--perhaps Egan's statement is hard to appreciate. Yet McGuire, even more beautiful than in her earlier performance in The Enchanted Cottage, must strike true, when she says to Egan with haunting sadness in her eyes as they rekindle a love 20 years lost, ""I'm not as pretty anymore. I'm sorry for that"". Such modesty and humilty are virtually unknown to our generation. Such reserve of character and power. Those incapable of being moved by this scene are barbarians!

And whoever this ""Poopy"" person might be who reviewed the film, with all respect to freedom of thought, nevertheless, it is obvious that he/she rather missed the point entirely in his/her outrage that two step children might fall in love and marry. Obviously, he/she hasn't figured out that step-children (the roles of Dee and Donohue) are not biologically related to one another! To call this a soap opera is ridiculous, for this film holds many things darker and more unimaginable than any soap opera. For the Poopies of the world I respectfully recommend a strong cup of coffee, some fresh air, proper nutrition and a good university biology course.

To more sensible and sensitive prospective viewers who might have enjoyed the priviledge of a little life experience, this film is a gift for the soul. Sublte in its depiction of the sicknesses that plague human beings and their societies, the whole morality discussion in the film might switch on a light bulb for anyone who has watched the news in the last 4 years. The film is architectonic and sure-footed in its presentation of adult love, perhaps uncomfortably structural for generations of post-nouvelle-vague viewers weaned on the thin milk of dissapation and nebulosity. This film is a shimmering work with vails of meaning far beyond its sturdy dramaturgical structure. It requires the viewer to function on more than one level, with which our multi-tasking generation seems, ironically, rather to have some problems. There are indeed some uptight 50's characters in the film. There are also some uptight 50's characters walking around today in gothic dress! However, there are mostly some characters and themes of timeless beauty in the film.

I think it's fair to say that the movie made the Maine Coast a travel destination for the rest of America. But above all it is the actors that make this Hollywood entertainment at its best. Richard Egan, Dorothy McGuire, Arthur Kennedy and Constance Ford (the adults: 40 years and more before the OC television series) and of course one of the archtypical teenage couples: Sandra Dee and Troy Donahue both of whom are better than they're given credit. But my heart then and now goes to the adult story. Very interestly the movie is about the consequences of sexual repression (the adult story) and the dangers of giving into sex too easily.(teenage story) And then of course there's the Max Steiner's music, not just his most popular ""Theme from A Summer's Place"" (Johnny and Molly's music) but the credit music which is Egan's and McGuire's adult love music.

Having seen it as a baby boomer teenager I recall being captured by the romance of the film and of course Troy Donahue.  All the girls wanted to be Sandra Dee and certainly that was reinforced after seeing her and Troy together.

The acting of all concerned, Richard Egan, Arthur Kennedy, Dorothy McGuire and Constance Ford still stand today.

The dialogue is relevant to today's world and the scenery is captivating.  But the story line is the keeper in this wonderful film of love, lust, romance and betrayal.

When I watch A Summer Place I wish more movies today were focused on romance and happy endings than all the tense, spy thriller, explosion movies on the screen today.

I am nearly finished reading Sloan Wilson's book A Summer Place and while the movie doesnt follow the film exactly, it is close.  I would have to choose the movie over the book in this case.

Of course, your sympathy was all with them - Egan's wife (Constance Ford) was a bully and a bigot, and Dorothy's husband (Arthur Kennedy) was a drunk. Ford went on to play the same character in many a soap opera - and why not? She was good at being one of those ""good"" women you love to hate.  Arthur Kennedy could (and did) do just about anything.  And don't forget the inimitable Beulah Bondi, who had some of the best lines - ""He tries to make a virtue out of incompetence."" All in all, with the romance in the air and a Frank Lloyd House thrown in, there's a lot to look at, listen to, and enjoy for many years...The plight of the youngsters really has changed though - birth control is available, abortion is legal, and shotgun weddings not nearly as common as they used to be.  Some progress has been made.  Virginity isn't what it used to be.  When you see how hysterically Sandra Dee defends her claim to it, you may think that's a good thing too.  Universal miscalculated if they thought Troy Donahue was the heartthrob in this movie - it was Egan's appeal that wowed the girls in my class, and they all hoped they'd look like Dorothy as they grew older.

118590,5,0790785366,"What can one say about this film? I consider this Delmer Daves' masterpiece. It was the first of four productions that teamed Daves and Troy Donahue (Parrish, Susan Slade and Rome Adventure followed). Troy Donahue was never noted for any great acting prowess, but he did represent the last breed of the innocent clean-cut naive teenager. This was Donahue's strong point and Daves used that persona expertly and effectively to extract the longing for the eternal youthful spirit in all of us. That is why this film is so viewable to this day. To paraphrase Richard Egan's character in the film: Our only purpose is to love and be loved. That is what this film is all about. Visually it is breathtakingly and lushly photographed by Harry Stradling. The dialog is juxtaposed between crisp witty cynicism at times and then beautiful tender passages of poetic expressions of love. The Max Steiner score and love theme have become interwoven into our everyday society as effectively as they mirrored the emotions of the characters in this film. The story at its most basic level is one of adultery and teenage love canvassed on an island on the Maine coast. However, the motivations and the ramifications of the characters' actions run much deeper. The expert cast includes Richard Egan, Dorothy McGuire, Sandra Dee, Constance Ford, Beulah Bondi and the actors' actor Arthur Kennedy. This film was based on the Sloan Wilson novel. This is one of my favorite films. I highly recommend it.",1170633600,,1481,4.928
118591,5,0790785366,"I can't improve on what the others have said concerning this movie. I myself was born when this movie was released.  I too, caught it on Late-Night television in the 70's (as a teen).  The movie, though 'square' to me, was very effective in getting their message across about Love, and what people would do to get it.  Troy Donahue and Sandra Dee were (in my view) cast perfectly in their roles, they were naive kids - twin volcanoes waiting to erupt.  Love - wanted, yet forbidden. I can just imagine the ""newness"" of what kids in that situation feel. Whew!  A great movie - Five stars!!",1169424000,8,588,4.457943925233645
118592,5,0790785366,"A Summer Place opened in 1959 and I saw it many times that year. It was the most daring film, and even now it is surprising that it escaped censorship then. The film is entirely concerned with relationships and sex..not a scene is exempt from this theme and it is very good and very crazy. Sandra DEE and Troy Donahue were the romantic teen couple of the times, and they are fabulous in this. Dorothy McGuire, Constance Ford, Arthur Kennedy are right into this steam- room topical film. Richard Egan, forever wooden, is an unintentional laugh in every scene, but with MaGuire he comes alive. Beulah Bondi has a strange, almost lurid encounter with Maguire over Egan's return to the summer place. Constance Ford as Sandra Dee's mother is so bitchy and hateful, she seems to be from some other galaxy, maybe not human.

Arthur Kennedy gives Dee and Donahue very frank, sensual advice in the course of things,and he is always drunk and expressing represssed sexual longings, in a mad, insane way. He is Donahue's father and calls the mother, MacGuire, a ""slut,"" and a ""Tramp""..to his son. Kennedy laughs as he makes these remarks to Troy D. It's so vulgar , that it rips apart other films of the period that have little or no thought content, except Sirk's films and Peyton Place..but this is better than Peyton Place..it goes further, in its obsessive compulsive concern with sex. Eveything is sexual, but not subtly; its sexual  only in the genital sense..everything everyone does on earth is workiong up to a legal or illegal toss in the hay. This is life..a search for a mate to have at it with, and part of this life is about the fruitless attempt to stop the onslaught of sexual union. See this film and understand a great deal about the 50s and early 60s and the hatred of incarnate flesh, finally vindicated at the end of A Summer Place, but with stiffness, tinges of fear, a slight hint of perversity. Sandra and Troy may be freer, but they are locked into freedom to have sex and nothing else..they've talked about nothing else, and their children will doubtless talk about nothing else. Almost despairing, like two nature driven apples ready to fall into death...,they are both so worn out at the end, over experienced.

There's also 50s idioms all over the place, odd tense usage , and illogical phraseology, almost deliberate, so that what is underscored so much, lack of communiucation, is based not just on differing sexual mores, but on the English Language itself, the grammar..very good!

Lurid, sex in all scenes (talked about mostly), and the theme to A Summer Place that makes you weep for these days to return.",1169337600,8,2629,4.721132897603486
118593,5,0790785366,"DVD please? I saw this movie when it aired on A&E, and it captivated me as a child, and still does as an adult. The theme song is great, and I still find myself listening to it. I became a fan of Sandra Dee's after I saw her in ""Gidget"" and ""Imitation Of Life"" and I thought her performance was so real and heart-wrenching. Constance Ford, as her bitchy,  controlling mother Helen, gives a strong portrayal of a bitter, frigid, unhappy woman who takes her anguish out on everyone around her, even her daughter. (She really gives Mommie Dearest a run for her money). The scene where she forces Molly to submit to a pelvic exam after she and lover-boy Johnny (the late Troy Donahue) have an accident on the beach (the boat capsizes) is horrible and makes the viewer grimace. The fact that the doctor was old and gross looking, and began to unbutton Molly's blouse without her consent, as she screamed, ""Oh please, no, I want my father! I've been a good girl! I haven't done anything wrong!"" makes it uncomfortable, but it also makes you despise Ford's character, as I'm sure that was the intention. Richard Egan as Molly's father Ken, is so handsome and gentle at times (he was equally effective in Walt Disney's ""Pollyanna"" as Dr. Chilton) is a man who is trapped in a loveless marriage who finds and falls in love again with Dorothy McGuire, as Sylvia, his first love, who also happens to be the mother of Molly's boyfriend, Johnny! One of Egan's best lines is as he and Helen are having an explosive argument. Ken finishes off his end by saying, ""Why must you insist on making sex itself a filthy word!"" Arthur Kennedy, as Johnny's drunken father Bart was one of the actor's best later performances. The conflict between the two couples and the predicament that follows was considered racy for its day, but considering how little is shown, you have to wonder what all the fuss was about. (Although the ""King Kong"" reference could bear some debate on that subject). The argument between Molly and her mother at the beginning of the movie, sums up the times and also, in a way, the relationships between mothers and daughters. Molly: ""Daddy, do I have to?"" Ken: ""Do you have to what?"" Molly: ""Wear this middy blouse to shore like a twelve-year-old! And she says I have to wear this armor-padded bra to flatten me out and a girdle! This thing even hurts, and I couldn't squeeze into this girdle with dynamite!""

It appears to be a soapy melodrama, but it really is a touching piece of nostalgia. Let's hope a DVD release is in the works. We all need to get away to ""A Summer Place"".

Update 2011: Warner Brothers finally released this classic on DVD, which looks very good, much sharper than the faded VHS tape quality. The only extra is the theatrical trailer, but I guess since the main actors and director are all deceased, it may have made any other inclusion of extras difficult.

118602,5,0790785366,"As for you, Troy Donahue...she knew what you wanted to do -- but she wasn't exactly as opposed to it as Stockard Channing  suggests.  (No, Stockard Channing isn't in this film.)  It certainly doesn't sum up the whole film, though.  Not by a long shot!  A Summer Place is layered with plot and innuendo, beginning with two unhappy marriages, and the subsequent hell that baggage lays upon their kids' shoulders.  Sylvia married Bart for money and status, spurning Ken, a lifeguard, who she really loved.  Ken married Helen, wallflower/homebody (oh, little did he know...), because he was lonely, and had just found out that his only love, Sylvia, had become engaged to a world-class arrogant horse's ass.  Ken became a millionaire, motivated (one is led to believe) by his wanting to show Sylvia that he was finally worthy of her, which might leave someone who hasn't seen this film thinking she was a cold, two-dimensional bitch, and that Ken was merely a dunce (the foolish things we do in the name of love).  But alas, poor Sylvia learned the error of her ways early on, realizing every day of her life that she let the wrong man go.  Well, dear, he's on his way to your house for a visit.  And therein is where this film begins.  Sylvia sees Ken, Ken sees Sylvia, and everyone else suddenly ceases to exist.  All except for their children -- Sylvia's son, Johnny (Donahue) and Ken's daughter, Molly (Sandra Dee), both whose hormones seem to have burst alive for the first time.  All the while, Bart and Helen, the forgotten spouses, watch fireworks that they are powerless to extinguish.  Ah, but they cause plenty of trouble for their soon-to-be adulterous counterparts.  Helen shows what a malignant, frigid, evil psycho-shrew she really is (subjecting her poor daughter to a ""virginity test"" by a creepy old letch of a doctor -- what the HELL was she supposed to have done if her daughter had been found to be ""impure""?), and Bart goes off the drunken deep end.  Helen, played to the horrific tee by Constance Ford, is the most despicable mother (next to Joan Crawford) any daughter was ever cursed with, but Bart is downright hilarious and is superb to watch as he delivers one sarcastic and witty deadpan blow after another, especially when he goes after  Helen's ""dignity"" at dinner.  Priceless.  The setting is breathtaking and the musical score is emotionally staggering, sweeping the viewer away into another world and another time -- one from which they may never wish to return.  The only thing missing was an assassin for Helen...All in all, the film is one of this screenwriter's all-time favorites, and that's saying something, considering how many films I've waded through in the last 30 years!  If you love the cinema of the late 50s-early 60s, you absolutely MUST see this unforgettable film.  You won't ever regret it.

118606,4,0790785366,"Movies like *Peyton Place*, *Imitation of Life*, and *Written On The Wind*, define the term ""potboiler."" This one, right up there with them, is oozing with angst over both young love and adultery, and features incredibly racy dialogue and plot contrivances for its time - as they all did. It has to do with a family - Helen and Ken Jorgenson, played by Constance Ford and Richard Egan, and their bubbly yet repressed daughter Molly, played by the maniacally cute Sandra Dee - who pay an unexpected call to the Maine resort at which the now-affluent Ken used to be a lifeguard. Ken's wife, Helen, is mysteriously anxious to appear oh-so-proper, and we quickly learn that Helen is a scheming, frigid, malignant wife given to phobias and obsessions. Constance Ford is marvelously chilling as the demented Helen - a character that should be voted into the Camp Hall of Fame. Richard Egan is the kind of actor they don't make much anymore - he plays Ken as the craggy, understanding, Uncle Bill-ish kind of father, who can be sensitive and still remain butch. The family that owns the resort whom they impose them selves upon, consists of Sylvia and Bart Hunter, played by Dorothy McGuire and Arthur Kennedy, and their wooden twit of a son, Johnny, played by Troy Donahue. Donahue, known in the business as ""the *other* white meat"", is hopelessly inept, and recalls the rueful words from *A Chorus Line*, which lament ""If Troy Donahue can be a movie star, then I can be a movie star."" McGuire plays her usual sort of character - cool exterior with passions that run deep, while Arthur Kennedy is virtually unrecognizable as Bart, the drunken dilettante whose family now lives in reduced circumstances and must now take in boarders. Young Johnny and Molly fall in love the first time their binoculars meet, and we become aware very quickly that Ken and Sylvia, both married to other people, have been around the block together before. Ken and Sylvia rekindle their love affair, making love in the boathouse, while Johnny woos Molly with such tripe as ""We're all alone on this earth."" Bart goes on drinking and Helen goes berserk. When Johnny and Molly survive the sinking of their boat, and spend the night on a deserted beach, Helen orders Molly to undergo an examination to see if she was still a virgin. Things go from bad to worse, and recriminations and name-calling abound. Helen brings the whole soupy mess to a boil by shrilly referring to Sylvia as Johnny's ""harlot of a mother,"" while Bart calls Sylvia ""common slut,"" and divorce decrees are served all around. Johnny and Molly are sent off to faraway schools, as the ugly divorces mysteriously dominate the headlines all over the Northeast. The children arrange a tryst over Christmas break, after which Helen and Molly get into it, and Helen slaps Molly into the Christmas tree, doubtlessly inspiring John Waters' (*Female Trouble*). After a suitable amount of time, Ken and Sylvia get married and acquire a swank new *moderne deluxe* split-level ranch home, but they miss the love of their Molly and Johnny, who, though separated, blame Ken and Sylvia for the unhappiness. Distressed at the estrangement, Ken refers to ""the loneliness, hunger, impatience and waste"" of unrequited young lust - just like he himself had - and tells Sylvia, ""I want them to come to us when they need us."" Molly and Johnny agree to meet up at the newlyweds' home, where, predictably, Molly gets ""in trouble."" There's lots of talk about ""being good"" and ""being bad,"" and the plot is riddled with scenes of inclement weather that brings about lurid situations - like when they go to his drunken dad for help, who tells them ""Sinners pay, one way or another"" and ""They need to be put in juvenile hall to cool off."" Fortunately, the troubled teens fine love and acceptance at the home of the Original Sinners themselves, Ken and Sylvia, and, of course, everything works out wonderfully in the end. It is turgid and tawdry, and enhanced by Max Steiner's famous score - you know: deet deet deet deet deet deet... - but campy and hysterical.

I first heard the music from my university radio station in the early 1980's. I was attracted to it immediately --- the music (no words) was so beautiful and so touching to the young minds. And the good thing is that the station broadcasted it once every day for a long period of time, as the signing off music. That was very appropriate because the ending of the music is vey gentle, fading gradually, like a wind drifting, drifting, until it disappears in the horizon.
At that time, I didn't know who wrote the music, or which country it came from, I even didn't know its title! And the strange thing is that, after I graduated, never once had I ever heard the music again!
Recently I found I have to try hard to recall the melody. So I took my rescue effort: I sang pieces of the music to a librarian in my local public library, who kindly helped me find the music.

(Then, there is the friend who cautioned never to trust a film in which the boy is prettier than the girl.) That being said, the film holds up surprisingly well as a super slick piece of 50's soap opera, in which the usually vapid Donahue and the baby-faced Dee remain rather affecting as lovers despite the handicaps. Thankfully, Donahue is called upon to do little more than look earnestly concerned, while Dee pouts and emotes in wide-eyed, photogenic fashion that brought out many an audience handkerchief. Credit should go to producer-writer-director Delmer Daves for almost transcending the material with an earnest plea to humanize love and sex away from the dead hand of our Puritan forebearers. In the uptight 50's, that was no small risk and could even be construed as a commitment to free love and communism. As writer, Daves may not have thought in subversive terms, but his plea was enthusiastically received by teens of the day, who flocked to the film in droves. As producer, Daves had the good sense to bolster his youthful celebrities with a first-rate supporting cast, including the always commanding Constance Ford as the Puritan witch, along with the ever versatile Arthur Kennedy, at his sardonic and smirking best. Also holding up over time--photographer Harry Stradling's glossy transformation of coastal life into a series of blissfully romanticized frames that contribute greatly to the movie's travel brochure atmosphere. Unfortunately, Daves remains an under-rated filmmaker from that era, while A Summer Place proves he could handle the treacly fare just as effectively as the more cowboy kind he was used to. Also of passing interest--anyone wondering how teen culture moved out of the 50's to become that of the free-wheeling 60's should catch this movie for its few hesitant steps, suggesting, I suppose, that it's the Delmer Daves of the world that effect real change, rather than the more lauded and esoteric art house crowd.",1025395200,,2135,5.102857142857143

This slick, colorful Hollywood soap opera about love and heartache among teens and their elders may have dated too much to have significant meaning to some tastes. Still arresting, however, as a look at 1950's lifestyles and values. This was, in its day, a box-office smash, and indeed, the premier teen date movie. The magnificent score by Max Steiner is still hauntingly beautiful, and was also  big hit when the film was initially released. Yes, the realistic subject matter of the film itself has been glamorized and Hollywoodized, but it's so well-handled by the cast that it hardly matters. Sandra Dee and Troy Donahue light up the screen as the young lovers. And Dorothy McGuire and Richard Egan are sensational as the older set trying to rekindle the flame. The strong performances by this amazing quartet, and, of course, Max Steiner's enchanting title tune, make this rise far above the ordinary Hollywood fluff.",974160000,40,1047,4.943181818181818
