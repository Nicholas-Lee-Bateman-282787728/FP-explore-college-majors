Barrett (Corrigan) suspects his girlfriend Kaylie  (Bransford) who is looking for a roommate is cheating on him.  She's not, but she is keeping a major secret from him that could jeopardize his relationship and his life.  It's hilarious and one can't help but like Kaylie despite her secret.  As one can expect, Kevin Corrigan's genius shines through and he's portrays Barrett as a lovable insecure guy desperate to prove he's right about Kaylie cheating. Mr. Corrigan can portray anything.  I always go back to Goon in Buffalo 66 where he portrayed a kind but socially challenged man. Many great actors have failed at being able to realistically and respectfully portray an independent individual with limitations.  Mr. Corrigan was not only respectful but showed his versatility.  He can play a sexy, smart, mildly selfish funny guy who can talk to anyone about anything and then he can play someone like (Goon) Rocky who is different in nearly every way.  Not only are we treated with his genius but also we have Ms. Bransford.  I remember Ms. Bransford on One Life to Live where she played a hilarious psycho. She was awesome there and she's great here as well.  I would love to see her star in some comedies as her ability for both dry, subtle humor and out-there blatant hilarious moments works together for some great moments.",1440374400,,1432,4.87603305785124

I almost want to buy  a timex turn and pull watch :)",964137600,5,320,4.316666666666666
