8586954,5,B00CWKW5DG,"If you've watched all of his other work, this strange little film based on an un-filmed Bela Lugosi project sprinkled with bits from other Wood Jr. material might hit the spot and get you an Ed fix. Only the real junkies will get most of the jokes and references, which is a dangerous thing to do if you want to reach an audience. It reminds me of ""Night of the Ghouls"" but lacks an actual Tor Johnson. You should never try to fake a Tor Johnson unless you hire an actual wrestler. I'm willing to be indulgent since if you watch low budget videos, you kind of expect some corners to be cut. Entertaining music and by far the most amusing thing is the bits of Criswell interspersed. Also I love the moody silent film portions that are much more interesting visually than the actual drama going on... which I don't remember too much of. But I did like it better than 'Ed Wood's Devil Girl' and 'I Woke Up Early the Day I Died.' I would like to see Ed Wood's original screenplays published to compare it.

Funniest actor was the man with the cleft chin, the film picked up considerably during his scenes which had the right kind of straight acting that you need for camp.",1392249600,5,1168,4.3577981651376145
8586955,1,B00CWKW5DG,"An ""attempt"" to create an Ed Wood style movie based on an unused Ed Wood movie title.  Filmmaker here utilizes the following:

- Criswell narration (actual Criswell recordings of his predictions coupled with a Criswell soundalike).
- Stock Footage
- Footage of some actors that was shot without the other actors present and spliced into the film.
- The microphone and sound boom visible in many, many, many shots.
- Poorly looped dubbing of one character.
- Blurry exteriors
- A floating trumpet (ala Night of the Ghouls)
- A Tor Johnson lookalike and a Bela Lugosi soundalike.
- A plot that is almost impossible to follow.

Problem with this whole mess is that all of the above effects are so overdone, it is difficult to watch the movie.  Of course the plot is a mess, too, so even if you could appreciate the staged gaffes listed above it is almost impossible to follow the ""story.""

Having said all of that, there are some mildly interesting things.  Don't think it was worth the hour of my life that I lost watching this, but perhaps if you want to punish yourself for your insomnia you might ""enjoy"" the following:

1. The actual Criswell predictions used in the film are absurd.  Too bad these are interspersed in the film and you just can't listen to them alone.
2. The last 5 minutes of the film are actually kind of fun (if you can last until then).  There is a poorly staged knockdown, drag out fight that actually works somewhat on a comedic level.

At the end of the movie (I think it probably ran just under an hour), there are some previews of coming attractions including the one for this film from the same director.",1391731200,4,1633,4.5426621160409555
