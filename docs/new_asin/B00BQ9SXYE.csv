I viewed this movie on a Delts flight from Japan to the USA. A couple are living together in Japan but are sleeping in seperate rooms. Both have day jobs. She likes to come home from work, put on her comfortable clothes and just lay around. He comes home and cleans house while she lays around. He wants to travel. She likes to stay at home. He gets a business opertunity to travel to Italy. She does not want to go until she talks to one of her girlfriends and her girl friend tells her how much fun she had in Italy with her boyfriend so they go to Italy. They meet a sad Japanese girl in Italy that says her husband divorced her and took their daughter with him. We later learn this is not true. I do not want to spoil the plot for there are many twist and turns in the plot in Italy. But all through the good and the bad the boyfriend is loyal and loving to his girlfriend no matter what other people think. This is an Asian movie but it has a happy ending.  No big explosions or special effects but to me the acting was believable.",1391731200,,1162,4.052173913043478
