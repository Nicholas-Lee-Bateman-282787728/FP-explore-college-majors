2400421,5,B000B5XPEC,"This movie goes beyond a science fiction thriller. It has one thing that a lot of science fiction fans love that is 'reading minds' but this was nurtured from talking to doctors and other sources. I like some movies that has some reality in what many people think impossible.

They tried to restore hearing and got more than that a 'mind reader' the only thing no more like her could be developed. She was a civilian treated like a 'thing' not a person and she fought back when they though she could be killed off when a military officer had her ability, but she fought back. She won and the military lost her because any 'mind reader' has a weapon and it sometimes is 'lethal'. They are watching but a mistep in their part would be a disaster since she left the Project: Hidden Lines by her own will.

In the DVD they said it could lead to a TV series sooner or later. Lets hope sooner.",1139184000,3,887,4.3053892215568865
2400422,5,B000B5XPEC,"When I think of one word to sum up this movie it would be originality. It was like a super intense episode of outer limits. This movie seriously takes the concept of supernormal abilities to another level, and the suspense factor is always lingering over the main character as she is able to literally hear danger approaching her. I think future movies could learn a lot from Eavesdropper not only in how a movie presents itself, but also in script, originality and acting. Superb, 5 stars!",1138320000,5,490,4.709302325581396
2400423,4,B000B5XPEC,"This is one of the best thrillers that I've seen in a while.  I was on the edge of my seat during the entire second half of the movie.  I liked the plot a lot.  It's very different than other thrillers...Very original stuff.  I don't think that I've ever seen a scientific thriller that has to deal with deaf patients.  It definitely grabbed my attention during the first half when they start to conduct all the tests on each patient.

It is always worse when people mess with the handicapped, since they are viewed as ""easy targets.""  I think that is why it is so intense.  I don't know.  I really enjoyed this movie.  It got my heart racing, which a movie hasn't done in a while.",1138233600,3,681,4.291338582677166
2400424,4,B000B5XPEC,"Eavesdropper was definitely a movie that I would recommend to those who like thrillers. I got a chance to see it at friends house, and loved the entire idea of it.  These fifteen deaf patients are asked to be part of an experiment to try and restore their hearing. The treatments cause these terrible side affects that cause them all to go crazy, except for one person out of the fifteen, Liza. The rest of the movie revolves around her and the fact that she has exceptional hearing, which ends up getting her in a bad situation with the people that conducted the experiment. It builds up and keeps you anticipating what's going to happen next, definitely the kind of thriller that keeps you watching simply to figure out why the experiment went wrong and why there was only one patient who survived.

I was intrigued with the idea of the entire movie, how people react when their own thoughts can be read, and how someone's entire life can be altered by allowing them to finally hear after a lifetime of being deaf. Give it a watch, it's worth it.",1137715200,4,1048,4.510526315789473

8081698,4,B000B5XPEC,"In an attempt to correct her (Costas Mandylor) hearing after a she became deaf from the sound of gunshots, the experiment went too well. Now she is of value to some people and a threat to others. How is she going to get out of this pickle?

A well executed formula movie. At one time we were innovated by movies where a secret formula, or radiation, or LSD experiments create a superset of senses. And of course the experiment hast to be covered up. The main experimentee is usually more moral than the experimenter. Others, usually the government, want to use the abilities for their own nefarious purposes.

So the story is not unique however the acting and details are exceptionally good. You can tell that this is a pilot and it makes you wonder who will survive to make the program.

For sci-fi lovers you may recognize George Takei (Sulu on Star Trek), and John de Lancie (Q on Star Trek: Voyager), together again.

The only thing missing would be the mystique of a missing film maker. Shads of Aimee Semple McPherson.",1505692800,3,1024,4.579234972677596

8081702,1,B000B5XPEC,This movie looks stupid and lame.  Do not buy it.  Save your money.  I watched half before I fell sleep...suck!,1387152000,,111,4.45
8081703,3,B000B5XPEC,"Entertaining, but did have its yawn moments. Some of the reviews were a little over the top for this film",1367193600,,105,4.3
8081704,3,B000B5XPEC,Not too bad of a movie.  Bought it mainly cause I totally love Costas Mandylor.  He plays an awesome bad guy.,1290124800,,109,4.142857142857143
8081705,5,B000B5XPEC,"I bought this movie used, for under a buck and did I ever get my money's worth.  The story was very original and entertaining.  It made me want to research the incident that it is suposed to have been based on.  This movie would have been a block buster if it would have had Julia Roberts or Nicole Kidman playing the part of patient 14.  The comentary on the DVD mentioned that it was developed to be a pilot for a TV series and I  certinly would be interested in seeing stories developed using Liza's  talents.",1188691200,2,512,4.28125
8081706,5,B000B5XPEC,"This seemed like science fiction but was based on real events. I was mesmerized by the fact that hearing could be so acute as to hear the electric activity of brain cells. The idea that this was real and not a made up story, made it more exciting to me. I can understand why the goverment wanted to use this person to fight against terrorism or in interviews with serial killers, as they said the enemy would never know that their thoughts were heard. This is still almost unbelievable that this could happen. As the saying goes truth is stranger than fiction. I have recomended this DVD to several people. I loved this movie.",1143158400,3,626,4.5
