This dvd has three episodes, the first story is... Ricky is in college and the dean needs someone to stay in bed for one week. It was to be Wally, but Wally had a date and climbed out the window. So Ricky ended up doing it. This was to be a competition against another college only to find out that the other college was doing it as an  experiment to see if they could live in a very small space in space. So Ricky did everything including going to school in a bed. So he did it all for nothing. The second story was about David is a lawyer and decides he needs an assistant to help with all the work. So he hires Ricky that is a law student.  David then gets a call from  his boss that wants David hire his nephew. So Ricky and David come up with this plan to make it really look awful so that this nephew won't want to work for him and it worked. The last story is about Ozzy and Harriet have never been on separate vacations before, so Ozzy decides to go fishing for one week without Harriet. Harriet decides to plan a week away on a cruise that is a hotel that is like a cruise in hopes that Ozzy will change his mind. Will it works it and Ozzy decides to surprise Harriet. He takes her to the bus station to see her off. Then he plans to meet her up there. Harriet decides she couldn't leave without him and backs out only for David to tell her what  his dad has plan and then he drives his mom there. So then Ozzy does  all these things such as sending flowers to the suit that he thinks Harriet is in only to find out that its the wrong Mrs. Nelson. Then Harriet does come forward and tells why he couldn't find her, because she went under her maiden name. In the end Ozzy and Harriet sing for everyone and all is well.",1401062400,,1893,3.992063492063492

8024333,4,B00029JL2C,"Transfers of PLATINUM DISC (aka ""Echo Bridge"") public domain TV shows is about average. No sign of restoration here, with none dubbed from pristine studio prints. Minor downside: this company superimposes a faint logo on-screen every so often.

When band leader Ozzie Nelson married girl singer Harriet Hilliard in 1936, the two had no idea that they and sons David and Eric ('Ricky') would become a national institution. ""The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet"" began in 1944 as a radio show. Two actors portrayed the Nelson children until David and Ricky took over in '49. The family act switched to TV in 1952. Their gentle sitcom ran continuously until mid-1966, thus the Nelsons were part of the American scene for 22 consecutive years.

8024334,5,B00029JL2C,"I just read the 2 previous reviews for this volume.  I had purchased it but not yet opened it.  I quickly did a quick check and there IS indeed sound on mine!  Haven't yet watched the full episodes on this one, but if it's anything like volume 1, it's a *****",1109635200,,259,4.03921568627451
8024335,1,B00029JL2C,It's too bad this dvd is flawed because it has 3 of the best episodes of Ozzie and Harriet....with good digital video quality....the problem is there is NO SOUND on the dvd. it is obviously a mistake by the company.....I have talked with many other people who also have NO SOUND on this dvd. If anyone has a copy that works....please let me know...it would be 5 STARS if it worked,1091318400,4,380,4.366197183098592
8024336,1,B00029JL2C,"--Negative Review:  I had bought this movie a while ago and have just recently watched it. Come to find out it has no voice/sound to it at all. My mother had also bought one and same thing - NO SOUND. :-( Buyer Beware of the Ozzie & Harriet vol. 2 DVD by Television Classics.
Note: I have bought other DVD's by the same company and the other ones I have DO have sound. :-)",1089763200,,372,4.027027027027027
