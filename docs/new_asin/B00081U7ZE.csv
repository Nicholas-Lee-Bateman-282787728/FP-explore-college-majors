20 Funerals is a face paced, non-family friendly romp, through the city streets where crime reigns supreme. The movie never slacks, and keeps boredom at bay. After a fellow cop is killed on his first undercover assignment four other cops decide that the system they serve is too corupt to do any real good, and decide that matters need be taken into their own hands. Thus begins the 20 Funerals, working from the bottom of the totem pole up, the cops extract their revenge and plot to make the streets a little safer. The results are sometimes funny, sometimes poignant, and often violent. When some begin to doubt the fairness of their plan things turn messy as the plans alter to keep their own coworkers off their trail. When they're assigned to investigate the very executions they're instigating things become intensified even more causing friction among the four cops. On top of that the biggest gangster in town has caught wind of their scheme and hired a hitman to hunt them down. The movie is riddled with great actors, some under-used (Brett Claywell), some with bright futures (DJ Naylor), and some surprises (Many of the guest starring Rap Artists.) All in all the acting is solid. The script is dramatic and witty, if laced with too much profanity at times. The only thing this male dominated flick could have benefitted from would be the addition of a female character, and delving into the history of the rookie cop's case and how he came to be on it. This movie might have been better suited as a cable television series, where the time could be taken to explore the characters we meet briefly in the movie. However, it still holds up to the test. A definate must see if you like action flicks, especially those involving cops, like S.W.A.T.",1118016000,,1776,4.7290322580645165
2256956,4,B00081U7ZE,"20 Funerals is the latest film to hit DVD from Wilmington, NC filmmaker Anghus Houvouras (Fearsome, Thugs Got Game). It's the story of a group of cops who -after the death of a fellow officer- decide to use some unconventional methods. Twenty names make up their list of scum that must be removed from the street in order to clean things up. The plan comes with a strong set of rules in order to keep things organised, but some rules are made to be broken. Things begin to turn sour when the cops are inevitably called upon to investigate the cases they're creating themselves.

It's a clever concept that could easily have been created by the mind of Quinton Tarantino and has some impressive dialog to match. This film is a must see for anyone with a dark sense of humour or love for violence, action, hip-hop, or simply, independent cinema.

Being an independent filmmaker myself with many influences and heroes, I know how easy it is to stick nods to personal favourites into a script. Quite often these can come across out of place and character. But in 20 Funerals the writer/director manages to tie in references to pop culture and Greek mythology and use them to the scripts advantage. He is able to add depth and realism to the characters and the world they live in.

Clocking in at just less than eighty minutes, the film is a tad on the short side. However apart from adding three of four more funerals, there's little that could be done with this. The film tells its story in a clear and cool way but does come with a few faults. As mentioned by a previous reviewer the opening sequence doesn't come across too strong, but this is soon forgiven and forgot when the film sets itself on track. What follows is a set of great performances from the leads, including DJ Naylor, Mark Mench, and the majority of the supporting cast, backed up by a solid Hip-Hop soundtrack, and great visuals.

I was hooked from the moment the 20 Funerals plan came into play and stayed gripped throughout. With plenty of plot twists, character developments, and outside party intervention, the film kept me on the edge of my seat. While watching you get a strong sense of the fun and hard work put in by the cast and crew which makes the whole experience even more gratifying. I look forward with great anticipation for this exciting filmmakers next piece `Dead Heist'.",1118016000,6,2358,4.593824228028503

I just finished watching an early screener copy of this film by Anghus

Houvouras. It stars DJ Naylor as one of four cops who, following the

killing of a guy in their department, go vigilante, and work their way

up the criminal food chain of the city, taking out gangsters and

lowlifes as necessary. After all, there's nothing that can't be solved

by 20 Funerals.

The film has a slightly weak opening sequence where we see the cop

killed, followed by an overly long credit sequence. It sets up the

premise of the film okay, but interweaving the credits with a more

tense, intimate scene for the undercover bust and eventual murder would

have boosted the opening up a notch.

Luckily, once their pal is dead and buried, it soon picks up, thanks to

some great acting by all four leads, with particular props going to DJ

Naylor and Mark Mench. DJ effortlessly portrays the conflicted

hero/anti-hero, torn between doing the right thing, and doing the right

thing. Herein lies the film's real strength: what could have simple

been entertaining pulp violence is supported by a tight script, good

performances, and (most importantly) and plot and characters to care

about, and that sustain our interest. Retribution for murdering a cop

seems justified, and when Chase (Naylor) slams down a wad of evidence

against each and every target we don't question the validity of their

mission. But as one soon-to-be-victim pleads for his life, petrified

with fear and asking for a second chance, for the sake of his wife and

kids, the morality of their quest is suddenly in doubt. And far from

ignoring such issues, the situation creates doubts within the team. We

watch with avid interest as these issues drive some of the characters

to empathise with their victims (breaking one of the main rules of

their mission - ""We don't let it get personal"") and others to beyond

rationality.

It is here that Mark Mench really shines, stealing the show from even

the fantastic DJ Naylor, with an enthusiasm and depraved maniacism

reminiscent of Dogma's Jason Lee. By his most fanatical scene, his

Detective Keitel has undergone a complete character arc, either changed

by what's happened or simple freed by their success to unleash his

inner demons.

Inevitably, given the structure of the film, it struggles to find an

ending to match the brilliance of what has come before, but the twist

in the final moments satisfies none the less, and overall the movie

works very well. Great visuals, a cool soundtrack, some killer lines,

and some hilarious moments make for a highly entertaining film.

Well worth checking out when it hits DVD on June 7th 2005.",1117756800,3,2694,4.832967032967033

If you want to see a great film with new up and coming stars, current moguls in the Hip Hop industry, action, suspense, great writing, superb production, skillful direction, top-notch cinematography, then this is the film of the year. You can really tell the cast and crew had a great time making this picture.

8055336,2,B00081U7ZE,"After a cop is killed, his partners decide the system for convicting criminals doesn't work. They believe if they had ""20 funerals"" that would clean up the town of criminals and just leave bad actors with a terrible cliche filled script. I kept expecting Steven Seagal to pop in. It was that bad. Didn't they do this in ""Magnum Force?"" Filmed in Atlanta.

The film drags on even though there is action and killing. Of course things don't go as planned. I would sooner sit through a Seagal or Austin movie than to watch this again.

8055337,4,B00081U7ZE,"If you saw D.J Naylor on Dead Heist and been fan of him since (me lol). This movie is created by Swirl Films which also made Dead Heist movie. This movie was made before Dead Heist.

However let's focus on conclusion of the review. If your fan of action independent movie. This is the kind of movie for you. Possibly the ONLY movie that D.J Naylor stars on other then Dead Heist.

However the action scenes are somewhat not connected, but the acting is good for a independent film. The music in the movie can express the emotion theme of the scene.

I like the film alot, since the story is outstanding, and like the actors. Although in the script they always add ""F***ing,"" ""Motherf***ers,"" and ""s**"" as a verb in the sentence. Which kind of annoys me, but I tend to deal with it.

However it's not a professional movie, as I said it's a independent film. But it's a good movie to watch. A recommendation for D.J Naylor fans (if there's any) Also if your fan of rap or love gangsta rap artists. In this film it features alot of well known artists such as Lil Jon for example.

A good independent cop/crime drama film.

3/5 stars (amazon state four stars as ""like"" film so that's why I put it four stars, but my critical rate is 3 out of 5)

8055338,4,B00081U7ZE,"here's the review from DVD Verdict's Bill Gibron.

""this effort shows promise, not problems, for everyone involved. DJ Naylor and Mark Mench are actors to watch, and if he ever gets his game totally together, Anghus Houvouras could be a genuine journeyman filmmaker. 20 Funerals may merely be a resume builder, but there's more here than future possibilities. It is a thoroughly watchable genre offering.""",1183507200,,405,5.230769230769231

8055342,4,B00081U7ZE,"Even though it plays out like one long urban rap video, 20 Funerals is still a lot of fun. The premise is quite simple, but it's also ingenious. Four narcs get pissed off when one of their own is murdered on the streets, and they decide to clean up the city outside the due process of law. It's a scenario you could actually see happening, and that's what makes it so enthralling. Together they compile a list of the twenty worst thugs and start executing them.

Of course, things go wrong.  The thugs don't like being preyed upon, so they call in an assassin of their own. Then the Police Department takes an interest in all these slayings, and in a really interesting twist our protagonists get assigned to investigate their own homicides. (Of course, these are narcotics agents and why they would be assigned homicide cases is never explained. But, hey, this is Hollywood.) Then there are internal divisions within the group, which makes for even more tension. And in the midst of all these complexities, the bodies just keep adding up.

The problem is that this film only runs for about 80 minutes, which is a killing every four minutes or so, and that doesn't leave much time for the niceties of character development. But that probably isn't this director's strong point anyway. Instead, the film is stocked with clichd archetypes and gangsta stereotypes. You could probably make a case of inadvertent racism here, what with the white cops dusting off the black thugs, but that probably wasn't the intention.  Still, there are lots of holes to the film, such as why these renegade cops would go after the gold-toothed lowlifes when there are so many bigger forms of evil in the world?

What the filmmaker did intend, though, was to give us a flashy, in your face action flick made on a shoe-string budget, and in this he succeeded. He probably didn't have the resources to draw this out to the two-hour mark, which is sad because the short run time really cuts into the film's skeletal structure, and lots of really important stuff gets glossed over. What's more, a major portion of the film is little more than gunplay montages scored over with angst-ridden urban rap music, sort of like watching MTV2 at 4 in the morning.

Still, this movie is incredibly enjoyable, the dialogue sometimes witty, and the various rapper-actors turn out incredible cameo performances. Overall this movie achieves what it sets out to accomplish, and if this director can find more exposure then he has an incredible career ahead of him.",1120003200,6,2524,4.7643020594965675
8055343,3,B00081U7ZE,"I liked the movie.  Far better than i thought it would be.  The DVD doesn't have a lot of extras.  They could have at least put in a commentary track, as i wanted to hear what the Director had to say.  Best part of the movie is Lil Jon and The Eastside Boys and Big Boi.  They were hilarious.  About 10 times better than Be Cool (which i thought sucked).",1118966400,3,354,3.9857142857142858
