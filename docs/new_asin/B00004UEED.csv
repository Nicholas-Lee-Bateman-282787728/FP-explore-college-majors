8095033,5,B00004UEED,"I love pokemon, and have loved it for a long time. This does include the episode ""Holiday Hi-Jynx"" a banned episode. Actually, George was wrong on some things. The episode ""The Ice Cave"" and ""Holiday Hi-Jynx"" were banned for the same reason. I first noticed something strange when i looked at the back. If you notice, Jynx has a purple face, as she does in the latter of the pokemon games. However, in the cartoon, all of the Jynx have black faces. These episodes, though to contrary belief that ""The Ice Cave"" was banned due to the relativeness to SARS, were banned because like Mr. Popo from Dragonball Z, Jynx has a black face. ""Blackface"" is a racial disimination issue. You may want to search google on Jynx, Blackface, or Black Face, for more information on this. There were issues with this, which led to Nintendo and 4 Kids changing Jynx's face to purple. It also seems that George missed a few episodes. ""Tentacool and Tentacruel"" was also banned due to the destruction of large building, forcing some people to painfully recall 9-11. You can get ""Holiday Hi-Jynx"", and ""Tentacool and Tencruel"" on VHS. You will not see these episodes elsewhere. However, I don't think that we will ever see edited versions of ""Dennou Shenshi Porigon"" (Electric Soldier Porygon) or ""The Legend of Dratini"" even though those got English Dubs, Nintendo and 4 Kids say that they will not show them in the United States, or anywhere else, only in Electric Soldier Porygon's case. All we can do is wait and see what we have in store for us next, with Pokemon...",1149379200,,1548,4.694852941176471
8095034,3,B00004UEED,"Yeah I've heard about those banned episodes.

""Electric Soldier Porygon"" was banned because Pikachu thunderbolted missiles heading towards Porygon causing several hundred blue and red flashes in 5 seconds. This resulted in 12000 cases of epileptic fits(seizures) in Japanese children and adults! The show was put on 4 months hiatus and was almost banned by Nintendo.

""The Ice Cave"" was banned because Team Rocket deliberately gave Brock the Flu or Hypothermia which ringed some of the symptoms of the SARS going around at the time of the airing of this episode.

""Beauty and The Beach"" was banned because of Team Rocket giving James cleavage/boobs to win a beauty contest.

""The Legend Of Dratini"" was banned because of the use of projectile weapons(guns).Guns have been used in other episodes as well but none of them towards firing at other people as shown in this episode.

Anyway it's a good buy.",1114646400,,901,5.02013422818792
8095035,5,B00004UEED,"Finally! A review that doesn't make Pokemon, or it's fans look dumb! As if the Pioneer covers didn't already do enough of a good job making Pokemon  look dumb. *rolls his eyes* Anyway...
The first episode on this video was  a Christmas special, that was originally skipped in the dub, and in Japan  too! It's about how Jessie hates Santa, because when she was a little girl  ""Santa who is really a Jynx, came in and stole her favcorite  doll"". And now she is starving for revenge! Meanwhile, Ash tries to  catch a Jynx on the beach. After Pikachu fails and gets a goodnight (okay,  it's broad day right now on the episode)kiss from Jynx which sends it to  sleep you could say, Misty points out that it is holding Santa's boot! They  relize that this Jynx works for Santa, and they try to bring it back to the  North Pole. Along the way, it'll be tough, with Jessie scheming for  revenge, and all that travel over the sea may be tough, but Santa's Lapras  may be a great help!
Then, on to the second special, a Winter special,  which was ALSO originally skipped in America and Japan!, 0_o;; Ash decides  that he can handle a mountain, and it will be no trouble to pass over on.  But then, it's night, the storm starts up, and it gets to the temperature  of literally freezing! And to make manners worse, Pikachu slips out of  Ash's hands from the wind, and Ash go's to look for him. After Bulbasaur  helps Ash save Pikachu, who nearly fell from a cliff, Charmander helps melt  a snow cave shelter for the night. And then, all of Ash's starters,  Pikachu, and Him decide to close up the hole, so no more cold can get in.  All they have to rely on for heat is Charmander's flame on it's tail! Will  Ash and his Pokemon survive this disastrous night? And when things get  worse, and they can only rely on eachother's body heats, and all of Ash's  Pokemon, Pikachu, Charmander, Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Pidgeotto, won't  stay in their Pokeballs, so they can keep their Trainer alive and not  freeze to death, it's only love, hope, and fate which will help them make  it through the night...
Then, the season finale of season 1! Atleast it  was in Japan... Ash is home in Pallet, and today he is supposed to go to  Prof. Oak's lab for some reason. He doesn't know why yet tohugh. Meanwhile,  Team Rocket are worried that they are gonna get fired, they are nearly at  TR HQ's when they see it blow up! And they see a mysterious Pokemon covered  in armor fly off! Giovanni and His Persian are still alive, and lucky for  Team Rocket, they only get yelled at, and not fired. But they take it as a  message from Giovanni as an encouragement boost. ^_^;; (Don't ask, they are  very strange) They have now renewed their commitment to stealiing.  Meanwhile, Ash gets to Prof. Oak's, and who is there, with him? Gary! Ash  and Gary debate on who is a better Trainer. Prof. Oak anylizes their  Pokedex's, and according to them Gary has seen more than 60 Pokemon! But  Ash has seen over 100! BUT... Ash has only caught over 40 Pokemon, while  Gary has over 200! Since, Pokemon Training is a major help to Pokemon  Researching, seeing and catching are equal in importance. So they are  declared at being a tie. Not one Traner better than the other. Ash and Gary  come to except it, and take echother's advice by the end of the episode,  they even show a side of them that they never show... a FRIEND side! They  even show how they care about eachother (as friends, not any other way you  sick weirdo), and respect, and fear (cause they may not be as good)  eachother's Training skills. They decide they will have a Pokemon match...  THAT can break the tie, who ever wins the battle, has better Trained  Pokemon, and THAT will make the winner the better Trainer! Who will win?  Ash or Gary? And what about Team Rocket?... they are DETERMINED to steal  Pokemon, and will their renewed commitment to stealing effect Ash and  Gary's battle?
This tape is great. It contains two Pokemon specials that  were oringinally skipepd in Japan, because right before they were supposed  to air, the seizures occured, so Pocket Monsters was pulled of the air for  5 months, and 5 months later was a bad time for a Christmas and Winter  special, but they were eventually released on two seperate videos with  different episodes or OVA's on the videos.  They was originally skipped in  America, because they weren't available in Japan yet, and since Pokemon is  made IN Japan, it was only fair that the Pokemon fans in Japan got to see  it first. It's nice enough that it is dubbed and aired here too! The whole  point of this rant is to tell you that if you are watching the Pokemon  anime IN ORDER, then remember this timeline of when these episodes fall in:  ""Ditto's Mysterious Mansion"" ""Electric Hero Porygon""  (Japanese title, hasn't aired in America yet, and not released on an  English speaking video yet) ""Holiday Hi-Jynx"" ""Snow Way  Out!"" ""Pikachu's Goodbye""
I hoped that help! ^_^;; Oh  and... ""Showdown At The Poke-Corral"" is the ACTUAL season finale  for Season 1. The only reason it was ""The Breeding Center Secret""  in the dub, is because thats as far as 4Kids could afford, when they first  started ordering, and dubbing Pokemon. It takes place RIGHT before  ""Pokemon: The First Movie"" then RIGHT after the movie, ""The  Evolution Solution"" takes place. Which is the real season premiere for  season 2. I hope I helped! ^_^;;",965088000,20,5405,4.531120331950207
