8168345,1,B000MFHKVK,"yes, i agree.  this tape was of very poor visual & audio quality.  don't waste your money on this one folks.  i'm not sure who to blame, AMAZON or the company who made the video, at any rate i will be sending  this tape back pronto.  in addition to that, most of the  ""classic"" commercials are from the mid 1970's & 80's which in  my opinion don't really qualify as ""classics"".  i was looking for  a tape w/ commercials from the 50's & 60's, which this had none of.  this was truly disappointing.",948499200,15,496,4.236559139784946
8168346,1,B000MFHKVK,"I looked forward to receiving this video tape. It contained many older commercials that would have been interesting if the tape quality was better.  Unfortunately, the video tape was almost unviewable due to extreme  amount of ""snow"" and interference.  It is tood bad that the poor  quality of the tape prevented viewing it at its best.",946425600,16,336,4.946428571428571
