Memory is the key to our identity

Today, scientists are probing our brains like never before, finding clues that lead us to shocking new places.  From editing memories to deleting our worst fears.

Are we approaching the day where at the flick of a switch, we can rewrite our past?

The above is what the narrator tells us at the beginning of this fascinating documentary.

Memory might be defined as the mental function of retaining information about stimuli, events, images ideas, etc. after the original stimuli are no longer present.

Sounds good.  But how does memory actually work?  This is the question this film attempts to answer.

In trying to answer this question, other pesky questions naturally arise and looked at in this documentary.  Such questions as:

(1) What exactly is a memory?
(2) What are the changes that are happening in the brain, the precise molecular mechanisms, that give rise to memory?
(3) Where exactly does a particular memory live in us?
(4) How come we don't remember all memories?
(5) What happens in your brain when you remember a past experience?

As you can imagine, memory is a HUGE topic.  What I liked about this film is that it takes such a large topic and condenses it so that anyone with curiosity can understand.

Throughout, there are brief comments by others who study memory.  These people are from such institutions as UC Berkley, NYU, UCLA, Washington University, McGill University, and Columbia University.

The photography throughout is superb, as is the animation.  Excellent archival footage is used to increase understanding.

Finally, this documentary allows us to see a memory being formed right before our very eyes.  Also, don't miss the scene concerned with eradicating arachnophobia.

In conclusion, be sure to see this documentary so as to understand how memory actually works.  I leave you with this films last words:

Somehow this complex choreography of single cells [in the brain] adds up to our memorya mysterious system that allows us to time-travel to the past and imagine our future.

But perhaps memorys ultimate gift is a way to navigate that sea of [background] noise so that we can pick out the experiences that each of us weaves together to tell the story of our lives.
