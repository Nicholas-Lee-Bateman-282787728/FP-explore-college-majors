8447792,4,B004XZOIME,Very comprehensive introduction to the game from a superior senior player. He explains all of the shots and strategy with laymen's language.

8447798,2,B004XZOIME,"I am still waiting to see if the dealer is going to refund all costs, including return shipping due to the fact that no where did it say, at the time I purchased this item, that it was NOT intended to be played on a computer, only on dvd players for TV's (my computer has had no problems playing all other DVD's).  Dealer said this was done to prevent the disc from being copied - how do others manage to prevent coping and still allow DVD's to be played on computers?  Bummer.",1370908800,4,477,4.173913043478261
