2041506,4,B0001XAOFW,"The best cartoon series ever done on my favorite super-hero, and I've watched most of the other ones.  It's a shame it didn't last very long.  Is it an accurate description of the comic book Spider-Man?  No, but so what!  Neither are the other cartoons, or the movies for that matter.  It's really as if we go back to the early days of Peter Parker (which would have been in the early '60's) and see what it would have been like if it took place in the early 21st century.  It doesn't have the serious tone of the comics (or movies) but it's not aimed at young children either.",1183248000,,577,4.247706422018348
2041507,1,B0001XAOFW,"I bought this video for my four year old son because he's a Spider-man fanatic.  Little did I know that this series is not meant for children.  When we started to watch with him, I couldn't believe what I was hearing so I flipped the box over to find the rating (never dreaming there was one since I bought this in a toy store right next to a stack of Teletubbie videos!)  There is a PGV rating on the back for violence but they don't tell you about the adult language as well as the sexual references.  Needless to say we shut it off and tried to distract him with a more appropriate video for his age.  I don't know if I'd let my 16 year old watch this!",1141948800,43,655,4.046511627906977
2041508,5,B0001XAOFW,"I recieved the 13 episode special for Christmas and it includes these 3 episodes on the DVD. It is the best DVD I have ever recieved I loved it, all of it. I liked the way they have updated the characters and music, I have a constant smile on my face every time I re-watch all 13 episodes. The fight scenes are amazing and I love the 3D effect of him swinging through the streets. I would definatley recommend this DVD to everyone.
5 thumbs up!",1104969600,4,444,4.174418604651163
2041509,3,B0001XAOFW,"This was the Spider-Man cartoon that came on MTV, not the classic one from Fox Kids. Its kind of a waste of money since these episodes are already on DVD with the 13 Episode set released earlier. If you noly liked some of the episodes from the cartoon then you might want to be pick this one up. It contains the first three episodes.",1085788800,4,333,4.21875

2041522,1,B0001XAOFW,"I was extremely disappointed with this video. First, we got the video for Christmas.  It was shrink wrapped, however, there was not a dvd inside.  When we told them, they were prompt in sending a new video.  When we did watch the video, it was NOT for kids!  There was swearing and weird sexual content, not appropriate for kids.  Would not buy a cartoon video again that was not a Disney or well known movie.",1333929600,3,409,4.4

2041525,5,B0001XAOFW,Saw a clip of this new series on YouTube and decided to buy it for my little ones. Turned out to be a little to racy for the little ones... Maryjane's walking around in half tops and micro minis. LOL Even my husband was questioning what I bought. This is more for the teenager/college student that enjoys watching mature cartoons. Very entertaining tho....,1309996800,2,356,4.666666666666667

2041527,1,B0001XAOFW,There are only 3 episodes and it's done in some kind of cheap CGI! Buyers beware! This is NOT the original Spiderman. Nowhere near the quality.,1201305600,2,143,4.538461538461538
