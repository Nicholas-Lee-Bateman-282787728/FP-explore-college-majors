8280606,1,B000KPKYD8,This DVD is absolutely HORRIBLE. Its NOT a kids sing-along. Its just some really old slideshow with Christmas music playing. HORRIBLE!!!,1512604800,,136,5.523809523809524

8280608,1,B000KPKYD8,"Should have read the review on amazon first... This is a poor quality DVD and I do not suggest anyone else gets it.

The ""Sights"" in this ""sing-along"" are just pictures of paintings or drawings taken with a poor quality camera, or they could also be someone's old family photos or videos (no idea who these people are).  Although the pictures are Christmassy, I wouldn't say that they all really capture the spirit of the holiday.

The ""Sounds"" on this disc are also just bad.  Only every other song has people singing, if they wanted an instrumental disc they should have made it one, or if they wanted a true ""sing-ALONG"" they should have gotten the songs with people singing.  Now the quality of the songs and the choice of songs is to be expected.  The quality is poor just like the rest of the dvd.  The choice is perfectly fine, and does contain many religious songs.

The thing that really made me write this review though is the bouncing ball is always 1-note behind!  How are you supposed to sing along when the screen tells you to be slow with the music!  and for the songs without people singing you really have to know the song to be able to follow along.

The one possible redeeming thing is it comes with a good copy of the 1940s Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer cartoon short.  Better than some other copies I've seen, but not worth the rest of this DVD.",1390003200,,1367,4.445783132530121
8280609,1,B000KPKYD8,"I am an elementary music teacher and bought this DVD to leave for use by a substitute teacher when I have to be gone.  There are no singers on the DVD to help viewers with the melody, and the ball is one syllable behind the music.  Not at all useable for my purposes.",1387324800,3,267,4.018867924528302
8280610,5,B000KPKYD8,I love having these dvd's playing during the holidays and use them when guest are here and also when I am home alone doing chores.  What a soothing collection of music.,1363910400,,168,4.419354838709677
8280611,3,B000KPKYD8,"Although this DVD on repeat (if your player has that option) would be a great backdrop for your holiday events, it only lasts 50 minutes. Also, it is (in my opinion) overpriced at 17.99 compared to some others that offer a similar showing in the $10 range. There is nothing spectatular about this that should have it priced so high.",1229904000,,332,4.55
8280612,2,B000KPKYD8,"Sights and Sounds of Christmas is one of those DVDs you'll maybe put on during a holiday party or while you're at work as background noise to add to a holiday ambiance.  It's like a new genre for DVD - audio visual filler, the stuffing at any winter meal.  It's not any better than having a radio tuned to a station that plays holiday hits, but if you want music to trim a tree by it could be a good choice.  The main feature on the DVD consists of traditional Christmas songs accompanied by still pictures of winter landscapes, holiday cards, and cute kids.  Yes, you heard right.  Over an hour of photos accompanied by traditional music.  Still photos!  It's seventy minutes of a holiday version of the virtual fireplace with a better soundtrack.  I don't really get it, but it somehow serves a purpose for people who like seasonal tunes combined with a holiday theme photo gallery.  Couldn't somebody do this with a Power Point Presentation pretty easily? What's funny is as lackluster as the main portion of the program is the extras are actually better.  They include vintage cartoons like Rudolph and Silent Night that seem more engaging than the other stuff.  The animated shorts are cute and worth a look for adults and kids who groove on classic animation.

VCI Home Video specializes in bringing vintage entertainment to DVD.  They've done movie serials, public domain classics, and even a really good collection of the Honey West television series.  They are a distributor who is well worth checking out, although the Sights and Sounds of Christmas seems to be just a place holder title in their catalog.  The original footage for this disc was  from a 1986 video tape the company released, and it looks and sounds like they didn't do much when porting it over to the new format.  Simple stereo and full screen images have a decidedly VHS quality making this a low tech presentation.  Merry Christmas!  Here's a DVD you can give to naughty children or estranged family members that would normally get coal.  I've ordered at least nine!  It's a DVD fruitcake for the new age.",1228003200,5,2085,4.704419889502763
8280613,1,B000KPKYD8,"This DVD is a mish mosh of Christmas songs with various, often unrelated videos as the background.  Not at all what I expected from the cover and description.  I think I could have done better myself!",1227916800,,200,4.527777777777778
