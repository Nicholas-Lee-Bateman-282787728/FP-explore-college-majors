8140709,4,B000HOJTXS,"Bellini once said: I want to write sung music more beautiful than anything the world has ever heard. He hasn't got there yet in this opera, though he does a workmanlike job. I searched in vain for those lovely long legato phrases that are such a distinctive feature of his mature work. He can, however, capture emotional intensity: the pathos of the final scene is very touching.",1380672000,,379,4.6716417910447765
8140710,5,B000HOJTXS,One of Dad's gift requests. He's traditional in his taste of productions and the ultimate critic (an internationally known musician himself) of the vocal and instrumental rendition.,1355788800,,181,5.7407407407407405
8140711,5,B000HOJTXS,"""Romeo"" is a trousers role, a soprano, in this curious opera, an anomaly that requires a strongly willful suspension of disbelief. In this characterization, Romeo is a hothead, the Montecchi 'capo' of an army of Ghibellines locked in perpetual warfare with the Guelf Capuletti. Clara Polito sings the role of Romeo with convincingly snarly ferocity. Indeed she sings very well, as do all the principals of the cast. It's a shame she doesn't ""look"" the role equally well; her femininity is jarring in a production where all the other characters look their parts. The drama is cast as a sort of modern vendetta between two mafioso factions, with the large chorus split into two bands of thugs armed with pistols and machine guns. When Romeo sings his defiance and threatens havoc with his sword, the pistol in Clara Polito's delicate hand likewise demands that ""willing suspension.""

Frankly, the theatrical values are not strong in this production, staged in the courtyard of Ducal Palace of Martina Franca. The chorus doesn't move well, the stage decor is clunky at best, and the film quality is amateurish. However, the sound quality is excellent, and that's all that really matters technically. This is an opera in which the music justifies many grievous faults in the dramaturgy. ""It's the singing, stupid!""

And Patrizia Ciofi - Giulietta - sings the pants off everyone else in the cast. It's a spectacularly emotional role, demanding huge leaps up and down a vast tessitura. Ciofi has learned her ""bel canto"" from her performance of operas by Handel, Vivaldi, and other Baroque composers; her ornamentation of the da capos of her set-piece arias reveals just how much Bellini was indebted to Baroque vocal practices, and how little he had in common with the later ""verismo"" of Verdi. Whatever the faults of this staging and of this libretto, Ciofi carries the whole show.

She has to. The libretto is godawful. It isn't a bowdlerization of Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet,"" though an anglophone audience will inevitably make that connection. It was written in great haste by one Felice Romani, who reworked a libretto using the same story-line that he'd done five years earlier for a different composer. The story is basically the same as in Shakespeare, but it completely lacks the psychological and social subtlety of the English play. It also lacks any trace of Shakespeare's wit and humor. It's a blatant 19th C melodrama. Ignore it if you can and focus on the singing.

Five stars? You betcha! ""It's the singing, stupid!"" Let me confess that I didn't expect to relish this DVD; I've never seen/heard a production of the opera, so the quality of the music per se and of the singing came as a wonderful surprise.",1347235200,2,2720,4.945295404814004
8140712,5,B000HOJTXS,"I can't speak to the rest of the recording, but this live recording does contain the extra measures of the chorus' funeral music for Giulietta that are contained in the critical edition of the score.  That extra music is not contained in any of the five major studio recordings of the opera (Abbado, Luisi, Muti, Patan, Runnicles).",1338595200,3,331,4.807017543859649
8140713,2,B000HOJTXS,"Perhaps I should perhaps mention, prior to this review, that I have no qualifications for reviewing opera on DVD. I only know what I like and that it should entertain. Previous to watching this DVD, I had only been exposed to two of Bellini's operas; Munich Opera's 2006 DVD of `Norma' and the live radio broadcast of `Il Pirata' from the Metropolitan Opera House in the same year.

Although a number of the reviews here give mixed opinions as to the performance of this version of Romeo and Juliet, they all seem to say that the reason for acquiring this is for the presence of Patrizia Ciofi. In this, I must totally agree with them, However, in my opinion the stage director, the costume designer, lighting engineer, scenery designer and props designer (forget that, there are no props except for a wedding dress on a stand) all done by the same person (Denis Krief), should face a firing squad for presenting a work that is unfortunately not up to the standard expected of opera on DVD.
The chorus, dressed in combinations of black and white, for much of the time stand motionless on the stage, often with their backs to the audience. The all white dresses worn by Patrizia Ciofi (appearing as Juliet) glow and create glare in the harsh and cruel lighting of this outside venue at the Palazzo Ducale. There are long periods when, in closeup, it seems that we are watching a very poor quality historic black and white recording. For no reason, that I could imagine, there are two linear light fixtures that cross the stage dividing it into three sections; one white and the other red and both sources of glare that is present for most of the work. Indeed, I think there is only one small period where the lighting is lowered sufficiently so that you can actually see fairly representative skin tones on the singers.

I believe that this is the only widescreen recording available of this work, so it is even more the pity that such a very poor video recording has been made. In audio terms Patrizia Ciofi is a delight to listen to and Romeo (Clara Polito) only slightly less so but, overall, disappointing, extremely disappointing.",1254096000,,2134,4.672872340425532
8140714,3,B000HOJTXS,"Des ""Capulets"" petit format....
Patricia Ciofi est bien connue (et aime)en Italie. Sa Juliette est fine, bien chante, avec une bonne technique et un timbre radieux  dfaut d'tre brillant...n'est pas Gruberova qui veut! Ses partenaires sont  son image, efficaces et courageux.
La production se veut moderne, genre ""Cavalleria Rusticana"" ou ""Rglement de comptes siciliens""... Pourquoi pas? Mais alors, pourquoi, lorsque les deux hommes s'affrontent, brandir des revolvers, alors que le texte mentionne explicitement une lame? Pourquoi ne pas sortir tout simplement les crans d'arrt?
Cet enregistrement a du moins l'avantage de nous refaire dcouvrir un opra peut jou de nos jours, qui mriterait d'avoir sa place aux cts de celui de Gounod.",1198886400,6,735,5.553571428571429
8140715,3,B000HOJTXS,"The musical performance was very good. Unfortunately, the updating didn't work. The Capulets & Montagues seem to be mafia families. It looks ridiculous when they pull out their pistols and sing 'I dedicate this sword to revenge, or when a sword fight is replaced by standing still with their guns pointed at each other while they sing. This is an excellent example of how not to update an opera.",1190937600,,395,4.739130434782608
8140716,3,B000HOJTXS,"I don't like this 1830 'La Scala' revision of this music as much as the original 'Venice' version. Much of Giulietta's music is transposed down and much of Romeo's transposed up. Lorenzo is now not only a priest instead of a doctor (which is a weird move, since this work IS NOT based on the Shakespeare play, but Luigi Scevola's 'Giulietta e Romeo'), but he is also a tenor instead of the usual basso!

Staging seems to have updated the story to the early 20th Century, and it is exceedingly ridiculous for Romeo and Tebaldo to be threatening each others for 5 plus minutes at a time with pistols instead of swords. The stage direction is also too static for my taste. A lot of standing around singing to the audience instead of interacting with the other characters... And this being staged outdoor, the camera work is sort of sucky. Lots of scene with one singer obstructing another singer's view (and a lot of time, the obstructed singer is the one doing the singing).

Patrizia Ciofi is the main event indeed. Singing beautifully (though sounds much huskier than her Romeo does), and actually manages to express herself successfully despite of the static stage direction.

Clara Polito is a soprano Romeo who actually sounds more feminine than his lover. The voice is nicely imposing with a top-spin and a rather prominent quick vibrato... though she doesn't sing anything less loud than mezzo forte all opera long. With the music transpositions, the Romeo/Giulietta duets are interesting to hear... It's easy enough to tell these two voices apart, but one wonders who's the guy and who's the gal!

The guys sing well, and I'm quite impressed with Danilo Formaggia's Tebaldo. Very beautiful and secure tenor voice (though not very smooth during long legato lines).

Maestro Acocela is supportive of his singers from the pit and moves the show along well. And the chorus is really good.

Too bad there are only 2 DVDs of this opera available. Keeping my fingers crossed a studio or two had taped a performance with Kasarova in Chicago or Paris.... or even Dresden! Please! Please!",1184025600,13,2084,4.823529411764706
8140717,5,B000HOJTXS,"The previous reviewer says the information does not make it clear why this is the 1830 La Scala version. I agree. According to the New Grove Dictionary of Opera Bellini did not have a soprano to his liking so he re-worked the score for La Scala to better suit a mezzo-soprano. The previous reviewer thought there were too many cuts, and it is about 5 - 10 minutes shorter than the other productions I have. But what is there is excellent and Ciofi does shine. All in all it makes for a most enjoyable evening.",1162080000,20,509,4.368421052631579
