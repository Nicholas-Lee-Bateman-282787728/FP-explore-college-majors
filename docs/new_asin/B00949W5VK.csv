5259517,5,B00949W5VK,"Joe starts out on a journey across america with just a cell phone and a camera man, and in the process meets with charicters both quirky and generous.

In a time where some people are begining to feel that life has gone sour, Joe, through his travels shows that the generousity of the human spirit is alive and well in america.

A feel good movie well worth a view.",1344038400,14,365,4.27536231884058
5259568,5,B00949W5VK,"A nice reminder that if given the chance we can all help...yes some may have been more inclined with the camera man there, but that's also true in life, you start out with one motive and depending on what you are faced with you do something very different from what you expected.  It also shows that where there is a will, there is a way just keep your heart and mind open.  Loved the documentary showing mankind at its best in a day when we hear so much evil on social medias.  Nice job.",1426896000,,488,4.170212765957447

5259571,5,B00949W5VK,This movie made me cry- In the best way! It's amazing to see the kindness of strangers. Definitely worth watching.,1423785600,,114,4.75
5259572,5,B00949W5VK,I loved it. I think it was better then WILD. Gave it to the Library after watching it so more could see it.,1422403200,,107,3.6956521739130435
5259573,4,B00949W5VK,Unfortunately I was interrupted and didn't get to finish it before my allotted rental time. I hope to find the time to try again soon. The short bit I did get to watch made me smile. Admittedly I've been discouraged by how people lately just seem to be so selfish and self centered so seeing such good people in the short amount of time I did watch really filled my heart. Good Job Joe!!,1409616000,,387,4.243243243243243
5259574,1,B00949W5VK,"After I began watching it, I realized it to be more of a documentary than a movie for entertainment. I can get reality without ever watching a movie. I prefer fictional or true-life stories.",1409097600,,190,4.617647058823529
5259575,5,B00949W5VK,So good!  I wish they had bleaped out the F-bombs by the one girl about halfway through the film but WOW.,1408924800,,105,4.0
5259576,5,B00949W5VK,Loved it!!!!,1407974400,,12,5.5
5259577,4,B00949W5VK,"The movie inspired me to start considering Craigslist as a real option for getting what one needs/wants in life, rather than steering away from Craigslist due to the negative publicity it has received in the past due to unscrupulous people.",1407888000,,240,5.025
5259598,4,B00949W5VK,Nice project. Shows how people still have a kind heart.,1407283200,,55,4.6

5259605,3,B00949W5VK,It was a good documentary  Joe is a clean cut guy who gets help from others going across the country. He gets help from people that look like him.  The story line would have been better if he had done the filming himself.  Having a camera person around all the time of course makes others want to be in the documentary.  The documentary would have been better if they had taken someone who was down and out on his luck to see how people would react to the not so clean cut person.,1401148800,,480,4.129032258064516
5259606,5,B00949W5VK,"with humanity (again) and esp. w/Joe - HE is who the world needs more of and he shows the viewer that there is still
tenderness in this country, after all. Thanks, Joe.",1398988800,,168,4.28125
5259607,5,B00949W5VK,"Wonderful touching provocative
Deep thought and caring went in to this inspiring documentary.  Have recommended it to friends and family!",1398729600,,137,5.85
5259618,5,B00949W5VK,A well done documentary/reality project.  Inspirational in the sense that it restored my faith in humanity in America.  Interesting though how often times recent immigrants were more helpful and generous than those who were born and raised here.  From that perspective it was a good cultural wake up call.,1398556800,,305,5.183673469387755
5259619,4,B00949W5VK,"I watched this for extra credit in my sociology class. It was very interesting on the trust people have given Joe, even if their were of a didn't nationality.",1398384000,,158,4.482758620689655
5259620,5,B00949W5VK,I didn't expect much at first. But he made me cry and believe in humanity again. Thank you all good people and good will out there.,1397088000,,131,4.076923076923077
5259621,4,B00949W5VK,"A friend recommended this to me, and it was on AmazonPrime. The premise piqued my interest where the main character 'Joe' relied solely on Craigslist and the kindness of others to survive a month with only a pre-paid cell phone, and the clothes on his back. He started out in CA, with no idea where he was going to sleep/stay, what he was going to eat, bathe, et al. Calls, texts and e-mails took him on a journey across the country with people who were on their own adventure and cause. An amazing story of goodness across the land of this great nation.",1395878400,,554,4.388349514563107
5259622,4,B00949W5VK,"The point of the documentary is to discover how helpful strangers can be to someone in need. I suppose the fact that he was a guy and had a camera man following him around made this a little less dangerous. Even so, the majority of the people who assisted him were of the eccentric variety. I would never recommend it because things could go wrong very quickly. But it was a very interesting story!",1393632000,,398,4.391891891891892
5259623,4,B00949W5VK,This is an interesting and well done documentary about trying to live off the goodwill of others and meeting interesting characters along the way!,1393200000,,146,5.125
5259624,5,B00949W5VK,.......but this was a great movie......it makes me happy to see there are people out there that are willing to help out strangers.....I thought it was pretty moving,1392854400,,164,4.892857142857143
5259625,4,B00949W5VK,"Entertaining documentary type movie.  Kept my attention and I was quite amazed at the risks of this young man. At the end, I was so proud of him!",1392249600,,145,4.178571428571429
5259626,5,B00949W5VK,"I left this film,.. In awe : ) there certainly is an ' every kinda people' -out there and Joe Proves It! Stunning, thought provoking, Inspired Me ! Thanks to Joe,.. His Family and 'all the Peeps'! I felt like I had Traveled THE WORLD,.. And Yes,.. I can not forget you- Berboun st,.. I still heat ur Song: )",1391299200,,307,4.133333333333334
5259627,3,B00949W5VK,"Joe is a pleasant guy who isn't afraid to ask for things. If you have better things to do, do them, you won't miss much by avoiding this.",1391126400,,137,3.9285714285714284
5259648,4,B00949W5VK,"this was a really good documentary about an average guy being young and carefree and making it for 30 days with no support from his friends or family or his own bank account.  He travels around the country getting rides, food, places to crash, etc. from craigslist postings.

nice idea but also kind of scary!",1390953600,,309,4.6
5259649,4,B00949W5VK,"Overall, a very enjoyable movie... The kid is cute and it's awesome to see his triumphs and his failures as he attempts to find humanity on Craigslist. I would love to go on an adventure like this someday!",1390867200,,205,4.421052631578948
5259650,5,B00949W5VK,"I'll admit I'm a little jaded so when I decided to watch this movie I said I would watch this objectively. After watching the movie it made me reflect on my own life and how I keep myself so guarded. I'm inspired to really pull down the fence and start letting more people into my life.

I really admire how Joe was able to live so fully without any of his creature comforts. I will recommend this film to other friends. Thanks for the movie Joe!",1390521600,,446,4.186046511627907
5259651,5,B00949W5VK,"Craigslist Joe is entertaining and very heartwarming, it's nice to see that Joe was able to find the good in so many people. I use Craigslist daily and to see it used the way he used it in the movie was interesting.",1390348800,,215,4.142857142857143

5259653,3,B00949W5VK,My family picked this video to watch My teen found it to be interesting in regards to survivalship out in the world and having a timeline to arrive to a destination across the country; dependency of those you meet along the way.,1389225600,,228,4.4523809523809526
5259654,5,B00949W5VK,"I loved that this young man stepped outside of himself to see the world around him. In the future when he realizes that he creates his own reality, he will love his spirit even more. I highly recommend this to anyone looking to feel better about humanity as a whole, and about Joe's every where, in particular. ;) Aloha Joe in Hawaii",1389139200,,333,4.387096774193548
5259655,2,B00949W5VK,"It is an interesting peice but hard to believe.  I think if he wasn't making a documentary on the subject, people would not have been as nice or helpful. l am not a negative person but a realist.",1388361600,,195,4.131578947368421
5259656,5,B00949W5VK,Today is Christmas Eve.  I needed to see this to remind me of how kind and generous people can be.  I was moved.  I highly recommend seeing this.,1387843200,,145,4.107142857142857
5259657,5,B00949W5VK,"As an avid Craigslister, this documentary was a cool reminder of the vast amount of resources we have available at our fingertips. There was never a dull moment. Great job.",1387756800,,172,4.766666666666667
5259678,5,B00949W5VK,"This was a surprise for us, we loved this movie.  What a cool concept and so out of the norm for today's canned movies.",1387584000,,119,3.9583333333333335
5259679,5,B00949W5VK,"I agree with the fact that having a cameraman can't hurt your chances of positive interaction, but in the end, I decided that Joe's experience was great IN SPITE OF having a cameraman.  It made me think back on my own experiences over the last 13 years (for me) with Craigslist Community. Dozens, including 3 wonderful, long distance rideshares, that were great, only one not so much, but even that was a lesson in life.  Joe's idea and plan was so simple and he is such a genuinely positive person, that I actually DID expect it to go well and I was uplifted that it did. Plan to buy this movie and pass it around!",1387238400,,615,4.339130434782609
5259680,3,B00949W5VK,"The documentary starts slowly. In addition, I thought I might learn more about Craigslist, which I did, but not in the way I thought. The documentary did pick up about half-way. I enjoyed Joe's reunion with friends and family after 31 days in Craigslist exile. I do recommend it.",1386547200,,279,4.714285714285714
5259681,4,B00949W5VK,Entertaining and sweet guy(the main character) we follow him as he goes on an emotional journey to found out whether the world can still be fine or whether we can no longer help each oth,1386288000,,186,4.3428571428571425
5259682,5,B00949W5VK,Wonderful movie! Gave me hope for humanity!!!! Joe is such a loveable guy... You will not regret watching this movie with all the interesting people he meets on his journey!,1385942400,,173,4.8
5259683,5,B00949W5VK,"""Uplifting"" is exactly right. The Internet is a big scary human experience, but it's a relief to know that there is still a subculture of good, kind humanity still there.",1385942400,,170,4.7
5259684,4,B00949W5VK,"I really like his style of filming, but I did wonder did he have a camera crew with him filming his experiences",1385856000,,111,4.090909090909091
5259685,4,B00949W5VK,"This is a sweet film. You wonder if he would have had so much kindness bestowed if folks didn't see he was making a film - having the cameraman probably made folks more comfortable, but nonetheless there were some genuinely poignant connections made with a slice of Americana old and new that are worth seeing.",1385078400,,310,4.654545454545454
5259686,3,B00949W5VK,"feel good movie, that's really the good part. A little unrealistic, A fortunate young man experiences pretend hard times by his choosing.
It does show that people are generally good. Maybe I should have rated it higher for that. It did have a couple touching parts. It was an okay movie.",1384819200,,287,4.647058823529412
5259687,5,B00949W5VK,Very uplifting movie....  It's amazing how many people helped him; granted... the camera does help him and allow people to be more trusting of a film maker than any random person but still; very awesome story .,1384646400,,210,4.675675675675675
5259698,4,B00949W5VK,"I just finished watching this movie and can say that I thoroughly enjoyed it. POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT TO FOLLOW ...

I'm sure that some viewers will say that the ""road-trip"" would be much more difficult or easier (depending on which way you look at it) if the main ""character"" was a female. It could also be stated that having a cameraman along makes it much more likely that complete strangers will lend you a hand. The film generally shows the strangers as trusting, which I suppose is the mantra of craigslist. As in the title of my review, if you have feelings you will be moved in some way by this film.  I think the young man from Iraq said it best (something like) ""Can't we treat each other as humans?"" The film did restore some of faith in humanity, if only for a little while.  The question that left wondering after the film was over ... What did Joe do with the bicycle that the young man loan him in the beginning of the film?",1384214400,,938,4.318181818181818

5259700,4,B00949W5VK,"This was a surprisingly inspiring movie.  We actually went on Craigslist afterwards and checked out a lot of the other categories, rather than just the for sale section. We highly recommend watching it.",1383091200,,202,5.121212121212121
5259701,5,B00949W5VK,Interesting true-life project that takes Joe Garner on an amazing journey that portrays human kindness at it's best. A must see!,1382659200,,128,5.142857142857143
5259702,3,B00949W5VK,"Quite charming except from a completely different era than I could relate to.  In the '6os we did it minus lap top/cell phone or even craigslist.  Our wanderings never went as flawlessly, but we still encountered kindness & had a lot more fun than Joe.  Kerouac did it best in the '50s.  The beatnik of all time wrote a book - not a silly semi-documentary movie.  Am having trouble adjusting to this current world...",1382227200,,416,4.5675675675675675
5259703,5,B00949W5VK,"Even though I had to wait approx. a month before they shipped this DVD, it was well worth the wait. I'm a 50-something year old female, and my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this highly interesting film. It was everything rolled up into one: interesting, educational, cultural, and many scenes were very touching. All I can say is it's probably not what you're expecting. It's even BETTER. Try it. I guarantee you'll like it.",1381708800,,427,4.783783783783784
5259704,5,B00949W5VK,Had my 15 year old son & 20 year old daughter watch... begrudgingly - they both thought this would be a boring documentary and both liked it so much they quickly text their friends telling them its a 'much watch',1380499200,,212,4.325
5259705,5,B00949W5VK,Really good .. Have told friends to watch! An experience we all should take. I too am a CL fan,1379721600,,94,3.75
5259706,5,B00949W5VK,"This is a must watch film.  It touched me at the very core of my being.  You think it's going to be about Craigslist, but it's really about our humanity... the actions that connect us at the deepest levels.  I was moved to tears more than once while viewing this powerful documentary.  Beyond how I felt while watching this film, it has inspired me to reach out to others in important ways.  This documentary has already opened new doors in my life.  Only an impressive film can do that.",1379462400,,487,4.415730337078652
5259707,5,B00949W5VK,A totally original idea demonstrating that people really do still need and actually care about the condition of others.  It also displays the positive power of technology and how it can foster relationships.,1378771200,,207,5.2727272727272725
5259738,5,B00949W5VK,"Oh, we loved this! It was such a neat journey, all across America. Joe is completely humble, caring, sensitive and serving. Not to mention non-judgmental. Definitely worth watching!",1378512000,,181,5.5
5259739,4,B00949W5VK,It did my jaded heart good to see that there are still kind people in the world that are being kind just for the sake of being so. I think all in all the message was received and it was easily worth my time!,1378512000,,207,3.727272727272727
5259740,5,B00949W5VK,"Cruising Netflix 'independent' genre, I said, ""what the heck...let's see what this is about."" (I've used Craigslist to sell a couple of things, so what could this movie be about?) I didn't think the main character was going to get much done and continued to watch to see if this movie was going to be about how cooky Craigslist 'really' is. SOOO glad it was so much more than I expected! Like other reviewers, I also wanted to know just a little more about the characters, but I can't deduct a star for it.  :) During the movie I caught myself smiling often and then shared the link on my Twitter/FB so that my friends can enjoy it as well. Thanks for a cool Saturday afternoon, Craigslist Joe!!",1370044800,,695,4.4296875

5259744,4,B00949W5VK,this movie was just ok.. this review requires a certain amount of words so I will just say it again. OK,1362528000,,103,3.9523809523809526
5259745,5,B00949W5VK,"Surprisingly an amazing  documentary to remind us all the good that we still have in the world from Joe's cross country road trip and back, with only a phone, laptop, clothes on his back, and backpack. Definitely a must see!",1362096000,3,224,4.6
5259746,5,B00949W5VK,It was good but a little too positive craglist can be a toilet and he seemed to get out with the best of rather then a true experience.,1361664000,,135,3.857142857142857
5259747,4,B00949W5VK,"This movie opened my eyes to how powerful Craigslist is and how it is like a nation upon itself. Craigslist can be used for a lot of good, but like with anything it can also be abused and used for bad stuff like theft and stalking people.

I have been selling my good on craigslist for about a year now and I would say the majority of the people are honest and don't take advantage of you, but there is the growing minority who prey upon nice people and take advantage of them. I believe craigslist should roll out ""premium services"" where they charge $9/month for people to use. It would bring in more revenue and weed out a lot of the bad apples.",1359849600,2,648,4.225806451612903

5259779,5,B00949W5VK,"Really neat documentary. I was surprised at how willing people are to help. If you have ever seen strange ads on craiglist and wondered who would post this, you have to watch this film.",1359244800,5,185,4.470588235294118
5259780,3,B00949W5VK,"I kept putting off seeing ""Craiglist Joe"", but being unemployed I was curious to see what it was all about. Though the movie really doesn't reveal anything special that Craiglist can provide, it did manage to show how there ARE still people out there who want human contact and are willing to help each other out. Do I think this would REALLY work if you didn't have a camerman accompanying you and a family to fall back on if you got into a bad mess? Not really. But all in all, it was a true 'feel good movie' unlike what Hollywood keeps trying to tell us sappy romantic comedies are. And if you like this type of movie, I recommend Tom Shadyac's ""I Am"" or Richard Linklater's ""Waking Life"".",1359072000,4,693,4.37984496124031

5259782,5,B00949W5VK,"I'll grant that the setup can be a bit on the manipulative side - having a cameraman with you makes it much more likely that strangers will allow you into their vehicles for a 'ride share'. This is but a minor complaint. The genuineness of people along the way, reminded me of the best parts of the people who inhabit the Pacific Northwest, both my birth city of Seattle and Portland. People seem sincerely game for the experience and the movie will leave you in tears on more than a few occasions, whether it be the cancer stricken actress Mr. Garner helps, or his experiences witnessing Katrina up close (and the efforts to rebuild it), but mostly the final scenes when he returns home, richer for the 30 day experience.

No, there are no ""action moments,"" ""danger scenes,"" or the like. It is a lovely, quiet commentary about average people in average places, softly helping each other. Could some have been motivated by the camera? Sure. All? Doubtful. No camera was there when people placed ads on CraigsList.

But after watching this movie while going through various financial hardships of my own, it taught me how to thoroughly take advantage of all the sections/categories that Craigslist has to offer. The film also displays how their is still cool people out here in America that will reach out and help you during time of need.

As a bonus for me, I also enjoyed looking at the dominatrix chick that Joe met during his cross country hike, lol. Other than that, this is a movie that I will keep around as a nice how to piece.",1356307200,,611,4.504504504504505

He said, ""I'm just so inspired."" That's great, and you'd hope a journey like this would be inspiring, and for Joe it was. But the movie itself is far less inspiring. The concept is a good one, spend a month depending on Craig's List for everything. The movie starts off in Joe's office where he's sorting through scripts from CAA, so it's clear he started in the biz at some point watching others make great concept films. The best of course of the genre is Supersize me.

Craig's list  Joe lacks a lot of what makes other entries in this genre good: a strong lead character and cohesive narrative. Nothing against Joe, he seems like a great guy and all, but he's dull as dirt. He may have come up with a great concept, but he's not the right guy to pull it off. The film is a loosely stitched together adventure of ride sharing and freeloading without a good narrative to tie it all together. For much of the month Joe manages to live off the kindness of others. This shouldn't be shocking, there are so many great examples of generosity and giving out there. But many times he fails, ends up sleeping in cafes and losing a ton of weight. A meeting with the founder of Craig's List is the best example of why this film doesn't work. The segment is limp and uninteresting.

It's hard to feel at the end of Craig's List Joe that the experiment or the film was much of a success. I've seen much worse films than this, but in the end it's not very good. This is the kind of film you'd see in a film school screening or at a lesser film festival.",1355011200,2,1697,4.247678018575852

How inspiring to see a film about a man who traveled around the US for 31 days living off of the connections he could find on Craigslist.  I loved how they shared the stories of the people he met.

Also I wonder if todays young women would dare to take such risks. Joe's amazing series of sweet

I've been reading and watching films on the themes of ubuntu (connectedness of humankind) and living money-free so had high expectations for this film. It was good, but seemed rushed. Stories were told quickly without digging deeply enough; others were not told at all, eg never met the cameraman and heard his side of the story. I wish I could have felt the inspiration Joe did and been moved to tears as he was.

One take away for me was, even though it goes unnoticed and unreported, there is a vast amount of goodness and generosity that people express every day using online tools such as craigslist to connect, as opposed to the rare cases where cragslist is used for harm (and is all over the news.)",1344038400,4,958,4.662721893491124
