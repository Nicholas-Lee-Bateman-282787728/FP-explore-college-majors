2922575,1,B000UNYJRC,"I just love spider, arachnoid, insect, venemous bug films.  I love them so much I watch every one I can get my eight legs on...until this one.  Don't get lured into this web.  The storyline is as pitiful as the special effects.  90% of the spiders are of the plastic kind hanging from strings.  There are more screams than script (duh), and there's nothing about this film that makes your skin crawl.  It just bugs you (no pun intended).  What really makes this a phony film are the theatrical spider webs.  They are 20 times larger than the humans, yet everyone can crawl on them without getting stuck like a sojourn on a hammock.  This one is avoidable.  Nothing about it is good.  If you really want to see a great spider flick, don't miss ""Arachnoid"".",1278720000,2,755,4.477941176470588
2922576,3,B000UNYJRC,"IN THE SPIDER'S WEB

Another film in the ""Maneater"" series in fact I believe it is the second and to be honest it is actually enjoyable and not as horrible as others may say. When I first learned of this film it immediately had something going for it, and his name is Lance Henriksen. So naturally I had to not only see this but own it so of course I made it mine. Naturally it was me and my bro watching this and as expected Lance was great and the film was not so bad. I would not say this is the best in the series but it is kinda entertaining although towards the end it felt a bit long.

The movie follows a group of friends who are hiking threw a jungle when one of them is bitten by a spider. Almost immediately she starts to feel the effects so the guide recommends a tribe near by. This tribe's village is home to a doctor who is an expert is spiders because the tribe worships them. Dr. Lecorpus [Lance] begins to treat the girl as soon as they bring her and his methods are a little weird. Aside from that he seems normal and the friends decide to go back to the town to get more help. Two decide to stay behind with the girl and that is were things get interesting. The Doc says there is nothing they can do but wait so they should just hang out. With that said they decide to go hiking some more and look for a temple that up until now has been legend. When they find this place they may find their doom and the good doctor may be behind it.

Gary Dauberman did a pretty good job as far as the story goes because it is interesting and entertaining, he is also one of the writers of ""Blood Monkey"", another ""Maneater"" film. As for the direction that comes courtesy of Terry Winsor and he does a good enough job but I still feel like the film went a little to long but I do give them credit. Lance Henriksen as always is great as the Doctor in this at the village, he makes for a great creepy kinda villain. The young cast is surprisingly good well not all of them but for the most part they are good. The biggest surprise in this film is easily the guy that played the police officer that went in to help out the Americans. He did an excellent job on this film and they actually let him be not only a major player in this film but the hero really. He was probably my favorite in the film along with Lance. Also Lance's crazy brother is kinda weird, but it added a little something to it.

I would not say that this is the best movie ever or even the best of this series but it is entertaining enough. Like I said in my last review I would recommend this to lovers of this type of film but any body may like it if they give it a chance. Lance fans will be happy with his performance I think and he helps make this a decent nature run amuck flick. Give it a chance and at least catch it on SyFy on a rerun or something.",1256083200,3,2829,4.019538188277087
2922577,1,B000UNYJRC,"This movie is horrible.  The story is predictable.  The acting and dialogue are bad.  The CGI and sets are laughable.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.  This was a low budget made for TV movie that may not have ever even made it to the small screen.  Lance Henrickson has made his share of bad movies, but this one is by far the worst.",1249257600,,327,4.111111111111111
2922578,4,B000UNYJRC,"Yet another terrific outing from the Maneaters series, a collection of made for TV movies about animals going amok that originally aired on Sci Fi channel. That sentence, by the way, should give you some idea what to expect from this movie, in terms of budget, plot and... well pretty much everything else. Nonetheless, its an enjoyable movie. I mean, for $10 what do you expect, right?

So take your standard plot... a group of American teens go tramping about the jungles of India. One gets bit by a spider, goes to find a village doctor, and they get wrapped up in a mysterious spider worshipping cult that steals people's organs and sells them on the black market... All that, and you've got swarms of CGI-spiders running about. Oh, and of course plastic spiders and fake spider webbing too... you know, like the type you can buy as Halloween decorations. Despite the insanity of the movie, its actually pretty fun in a cheesy way. It also stars Lance Henriksen, which only added to the appeal for me.

I can only imagine the budget they must have had while filming this. Although set in India, my first guess would be that it was actually filmed in Thailand. Especially since theres only one Indian actor in the film, and the villagers look more like a bunch of people from Southeast Asia clad in loinclothes and turbans. Still, I didn't go into it looking for scientific or cultural accuracy. Its just a cheap 'animal attack of the week' type film, but a fun one at that. So keep up the good work, and look for more of the Maneaters movies, because thus far they've all been pretty good (or bad maybe).",1211587200,5,1608,4.579861111111111
2922579,2,B000UNYJRC,"In the Spider's Web (Terry Winsor, 2007)

I have to admit, about halfway into this movie, I was really prepared to like it. Spiders make great movie monsters, and the cast weren't entirely shabby. Then we get to endless people-being-chased-by-spiders-down-tunnels. And the stupid commenced. I mean, come on. You're in spider-infested tunnels that are thick with spiderwebs. You're carrying a torch. How hard is it to come up with the right answer? Hard enough, it seems, that it takes square-jawed hero John (Cian Barry, who bears more than a passing resemblance to Breaking Benjamin vocalist Ben Burnley) over half an hour of movie time running around in those tunnels to do the thing that I'm sure 90% of the people watching this movie would have done before they went into the tunnels in the first place.

In any event, the story: John is on vacation with some friends. There's Gina (Emma Catherwood), who's completely smitten with John, and Stacy (Lisa Livingstone), who thinks it's incredibly stupid that Gina and John haven't gotten it on yet, since it's pretty obvious the feeling's mutual. Then there's Brian (Mike Rogers) and Phil (Michael Smiley). One of them's a guide, but which one of them it is seems to keep changing. I originally thought it was Phil, but then it seemed to be Brian, then... oh, you know. And there's Geraldine (Jane Perry), who seems to be a naturalist of some sort. (As you can tell by my somewhat befuddled commentary, character development was not a huge part of the script.) One night while they're in the jungle, Geraldine gets bitten by a spider, and the group are forced to find their way to the nearest village, where an American doctor, Lecorpus (Lance Henriksen), and his brother have taken up residence. Lecorpus does his thing, and while Geraldine recuperates, the group decides to do the one thing every group must do in a horror film: split up. Brilliant! (There's another main character-- actually, the best of the bunch, a local cop who provides wonderful comic relief-- but he is, unfortunately, uncredited. Whoever you were, you almost saved this movie!) Brian, Gina, and John head back to town to try and scare up some medical supplies for the doctor, while Stacy and Phil decide to go explore the ruins of an old temple, which is why the group was out in the jungle in the first place. Hint: if your friend was bitten by an oddly non-indigenous spider, and the big temple you came to explore is carved in the shape of a spider, you should probably leave. Quickly. This is, however, a horror film, and everyone in it, therefore, must be a total idiot.

But, like I said, I did originally have high hopes for this. Gary Dauberman's first script actually has some real characters in it; for all they're dumb, and their roles are inconsistent, they are pretty well-drawn (especially for a Sci-Fi Channel Original Movie). Henriksen, whose previously brilliant career has been sidetracked by a string of godawful movies like this for about a decade, probably does the best acting I've seen from him since the criminally short-lived TV series Millennium. The others aren't too bad either, when the script isn't forcing them to be terminally idiotic. But, man, I just can't get past the stupid. You're surrounded by spiderwebs, and you're carrying a torch... **",1209427200,,3306,4.858156028368795
2922580,4,B000UNYJRC,"One day I watched a film called Night Feeders and found some real talent at work.  I had a similar feeling with this film.  Lance Henriksen (the only actor whose name is used in the packaging) is a mysterious doctor living with a jungle tribe.  A jungle tour runs afoul of a spider and they go to the native village for medical help.  These natives worship spiders as gods and Lance seems to have some similar feelings.  Some of the tour stay in the village and some go back to civilization for additional help.  Eventually we find out what Lance is up to and we get a pretty good resolution.

The story is not great but it has some interesting twists and traits.  Like with Night Feeders an unexpected character rises to the top.  This character is one of my current favorites from recent movies and shows that the makers were willing to try something different.  The rest of the film is not as good as Night Feeders in originality  and has a few problems.  For some reason the natives who worship the spiders also eat them.  In one scene Lance looks like he is participating, even chewing, although the effects team, or someone, let the spider be seen going right past his head instead of into his mouth.  There is no explanation as to why the natives are helping Lance and he seems to have no real power over them.  I guess they were going for a little Doctor Moreau.  But overall it is an okay film and worth it for that one special character.  Check it out.",1206403200,7,1462,4.37546468401487
2922581,3,B000UNYJRC,"There are LOTS of creepy crawly spiders in this average spider flick.  Six backpackers on a vacation in some unnamed country stumble into a jungle with aome pretty vicious spiders.  When one of them is bitten by a spider, they seek help from a reclusive mysterious doctor (Lance Henriksen, who seems to take any role these days), and they find all is not as it seems.
The plot tries for originality with its harvested organs storyline, but it's basically an exercise in let's get the heck out of here.  The spider fx are pretty creepy and the movie has good production values.  Fans of the genre should be sufficiently satisfied.",1194566400,5,629,4.6909090909090905
2922582,2,B000UNYJRC,"I am a big fan of spider movies however this one was boring and unimaginative. Normally I fancy the moveies where there is at least one big spider that will terrorize the town or mountain range or what ever, in this case there was none, and the one guy who you thought might be a freak because his head was covered the whole movie when they finally unmasked him I have seen better makeup in 1950's B movies",1193011200,3,406,4.217948717948718
8213882,2,B000UNYJRC,"Released to TV in 2007 and directed by Terry Winsor, ""In the Spiders Web"" stars Lance Henriksen as a dubious American doctor in the jungles of Northern India who seems to like arachnids a little too much. A group of American backpackers and their guide are forced to seek him out when one of their members is bit by a poisonous spider.  Arachnid horror ensues.

This cartoony TV-horror flick has several things in its favor: Authentic jungle locations, plentiful spiders of various kinds (both real and CGI), Lance Henriksen and a winsome enough female lead (Emma Catherwood). The sets are good too, including the cave sets, although the ubiquitous webbing looks decidedly fake. As far as the authentic jungle locations go, the hikers are all obviously sweating in the sweltering forest heat. Yet its obvious by the appearance of the Natives that this isn't Northern India, but rather 1200 miles around the corner in Thailand. Theres only like one person who looks of Indian origin, which I suppose isn't a biggie for a TV flick.

Unfortunately, the story lacks drive despite the jungle action and ominous score (which is good, by the way). Moreover, I never cared about the characters; and Catherwoods cuteness only goes so far (shes actually a little thin for my tastes, but shes decent and definitely cute). Theres a big reveal in the final act, but I predicted it at the half hour mark.

So theres a lot of good in this comic booky spider-horror movie, but its brought down by its half-baked storytelling. The script needed serious work to flesh out its potential, but the producers didn't care enough to blow the money. They basically said, Thats good enough; lets shoot! No, it wasnt.

The film runs 88 minutes and was shot in Krabi, Thailand. The screenplay was written by Gary Dauberman.

The fight scenes are cheesy but The Spider also is a perfect shot and often uses two guns ...one in each hand... (LOL)....what makes this better than the average serial is the clever plot and why beat up the bad guys who live to come back and fight again....The Spider just shoots them. End of Thug..... The Spider also uses (then) cutting edge technology like the HUDSON radio band to spy on  the Octopus Gang ....TV type phone device.... triangulation units to track the Thugs using their own radio waves......Hull is both handsome and very good at characters....which helps move this along.

8213888,3,B000UNYJRC,"It would be great if the scriptwriter for a horror movie, just for once, allowed the characters to act ""rationally"" rather than insanely stupid. Here is what sane people do not do:
1) Tromp through a thick jungle that is covered in massive spider webbing ""everywhere""!
2) Camp out in the middle of a jungle underneath a massive spider web canopy!
3) Trust an eccentric ""medical"" doctor living in a remote village full of ""spider-worshippers.""
4) Not think it odd that said eccentric ""medical"" doctor keeps grossly long finger nails on only one of his hands, and has a brother who runs around with his head covered beneath a thick net of spider webbing who also has grossly long finger nails on the same hand!
5) Attempt to rationalize everything you know ""ain't"" right about this village and doctor!
6) Come upon a temple cavern whose entrance is shaped like the jaws and legs of a spider - and then dash right inside to see what's in there!
7) Wonder around in a cavern covered from top to bottom in massive spider webbing - and then keep going in deeper!
8) Behave as if you are in ""Disneyland"" with all the cool attractions!
9) Crash a party of ""spider-worshippers"" engaged in... well... spider worship!
