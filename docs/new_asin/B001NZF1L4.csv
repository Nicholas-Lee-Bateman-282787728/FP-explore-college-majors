I do understand this was taken from a VHS cassette so I understand how trying to convert old technology in to new and be the reason but, the content as well was not what I expected.  I expected more... but overall if given an opportunity to purchase again I wouldn't.  Poor audio and video quality!!!!!",1348444800,,363,4.388059701492537
