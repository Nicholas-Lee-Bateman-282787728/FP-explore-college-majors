7925008,5,B00004WCEH,Sound it Out Land Phonics 2 is an excellent video for families and  classrooms.  I teach first grade and my students enjoy the video.  Even  those already capable of reading the words enjoyed the animation and songs.  Others enjoyed the opportunity to learn new words.  It's full of sight  words and helpful reading strategies.  I would recommend this videos for  classrooms and families.,969235200,7,388,5.031746031746032
