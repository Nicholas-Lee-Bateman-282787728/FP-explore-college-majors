1827809,4,B000085RPP,"CRIME SCHOOL reunites Humphrey Bogart with those wild, young Hollywood hooligans, the Dead End Kids. At the time, in 1938, the Dead End Kids, and not Bogie, were the bigger noise on the Warner Brothers lot. It'll be a few years yet before Bogart's leading man breakthrough in 1941's HIGH SIERRA and MALTESE FALCON, with CASABLANCA cementing him as a celluloid icon the year after that. But back in 1938, yeah, the Dead End Kids received top billing over Bogie and the larger font on the movie posters.

The Dead End Kids have one schtick, and that's to act the fool and mug and be boisterous. And their act works in both a comedy setting (SPOOKS RUN WILD, GHOSTS ON THE LOOSE) and a hard-hitting drama (DEAD END, THEY MADE ME A CRIMINAL). Only, in a dramatic picture, the tone is naturally edgier. CRIME SCHOOL happens to be a drama. A kid sentenced to a corrections facility is whipped viciously. Another kid commits manslaughter. The prison food stinks. The facility's outside fences are mounted with barbed wire. And Humphrey Bogart is in it. So, of course, it's a drama.

When foul-tempered slum punk Spike (Leo Gorcey) inadvertently kills a junkman, none of the other Dead End Kids will squeal, and so they're all sentenced to two years in a reformatory. Only this happens to be a reformatory run by a sadistic warden (Cy Kendall). Records show that juvenile delinquents serving a stint in this reformatory are so abused that they emerge that much more hardened and embittered and more likely to return to a life of crime. Sixteen minutes into the film, in steps Bogie as new Deputy Commissioner Mark Braden. He aims to improve conditions at this correctional facility. He ends up firing a host of shady prison guards, as well as the sadistic warden, and, right about then, we're all thinking: ""Yeah, like that's gonna stick."" Even more challenging is Braden's try at winning over the kids, full of cynicism as they are, beaten as they've been. Braden concentrates his efforts on the Dead End Kids' defiant ringleader, Frank Warren (Billy Halop, in a sizable role). I'm sure Frankie's having a lovely older sister, Sue (Gale Page), has got nothing to do with it.

CRIME SCHOOL is a by-the-books drama, laced with a sprinkle of hokum, but elevated by Bogie's presence and the Dead End Kids' sometimes amusing interactions. There's just enough urgency in the narrative to keep the tension going. I enjoyed Leo Gorcey's heel turn. I'd seen other films in which Gorcey flirts with being an all-out jerk, and here he goes the full route. So that's interesting to watch. And just like when the sheriff rides in to clean up a town, it's fun watching Bogie take charge at the reformatory. My favorite scene is probably Braden's climactic drag-out, knock-down brawl with that slimy head guard Cooper. We don't see the fight at all. Instead we eyeball the guard assigned by Braden to stand watch outside the door. When a distraught Sue tries to go thru the door after a particularly loud thumping noise, the guard tells her: ""Oh, that's just Mr. Braden going over the books with Mr. Cooper... Have a piece of gum?"" Anyway, Braden ends up getting the girl, ends up winning the kids over, ends up reforming them. It's a fairy tale ending. In real life, the Dead End Kids never did stop their wild antics on the studio lot.",1349827200,,3315,4.721934369602764
1827810,5,B000085RPP,I bought Crime School from Amazon and I found that the  picture  quality was  very good.  It would have been nice if Warner had had some extras in it  but the main thing was that the  picture was  crystal clear.,1332892800,,211,4.125
1827811,3,B000085RPP,"The film is typical of the '30s WB approach by creating OTT street kids with hearts of gold (zoom to today where they'd be the ""biggest threat to society"".) It's a harmless way to spend 85 minutes watching Bogart being tough but nice with a script that belongs in a kids comic.

The pricing of the DVD is though is way too much - the picture has scratches, holes and dirt throughout; the soundtrack has drop-outs and variable speeds.

It's bizarre that WB provide a case and a proper sleeve but the actual film has been grabbed from the shelf without a clean-up.",1309737600,,562,4.446601941747573
1827812,5,B000085RPP,"This is a really well done crime drama & social commentary about slum life, poverty,juvenile delinquency & life inside a horribly sadistic reformatory, or ""Crime School"". The film does raise the question : How do you reform a bunch of incorrigible degenerates ? By ""kindness"" & ""nice"" rehabilitation or by violent corporal punishment & torture ? Do we handle them with kid gloves or do we whip & beat the daylights out of them ? What's the answer ? This movie was first seen in 1938 & 72 years later we still haven't figured that out. Look at our prisons they are filled & overcrowded.

Back in the 1960's when I was the same age as The Dead End Kids I used to get my bare butt whipped & beaten with a belt by my mother even if I came home 5 minutes late from ""Crime School"" so to speak. I used to get a paddle ( with holes in it ) from the principal. Crime School was the first film The Dead End Kids made for Warner Bros. After ""Dead End"" they were so popular they even got top billing over Humphrey Bogart who was 2nd billed under them. Despite the roaring success of ""Dead End"" Samuel Goldwyn sold their 2 year contract to Jack Warner after The Dead End Kids drove a truck & crashed into a sound stage during the filming of ""Dead End"" & caused major expensive studio damage to Samuel Goldwyn.

Unlike ""Dead End"" & Angels With Dirty Faces"", ""Crime School"" gives The Dead End Kids more screen time & center stage for this movie really belongs to them. Bogart has almost as much screen time & is really very good & effective in a rare ""good guy"" role as deputy commissioner of corrections official Mark Braden. Also Cy Kendall turns in a great performance as the brutally tough superintendant Morgan. I mean he is downright scary !! It's high time this film is finally available for this movie needs to be seen. If you're a fan of The Dead End Kids & Humphrey Bogart you will want to watch this & add this to your collection for ""Crime School"" is a movie not to be missed. This is essential viewing pleasure.  Recommended !!",1285718400,4,2025,4.337730870712401
1827813,3,B000085RPP,"I'm a Dead End Kids freak, and I consider this to be their best film.  ""Dead End"" and ""Angels With Dirty Faces"" were and are better films overall, but ""Crime School"" showcases the kids more than any other.  Billy Halop gets to really act here, ya know?  But the DVD itself I found disappointing.  26 bucks plus shipping charges, and they didn't even use a very good-quality copy of the film for this DVD?  Really, I've seen this picture on Turner Classic Movies, and they have a better copy.",1276560000,16,491,4.47191011235955
1827814,4,B000085RPP,"What a great film this was. I've always enjoyed all Dead End Kids, East Side Kids and Bowery Boys films. For some strange reason this gem is only available in a murky washed out DVD-R transferred version. What a crime in itself either release the film  correctly or don't bother at all. What a tease. What a waste of my money and time. The stars are for the movie ""not"" the Warner Archive Collection DVD-R.",1260316800,20,406,4.413333333333333

1827816,3,B000085RPP,"""Crime School"" is clearly from the same mold as ""San Quentin"" and Cagney's ""The Mayor of Hell.""

It is a predictable vehicle for the Dead End Kids, in which Bogart played a deputy commissioner of correction who takes over the running of a reformatory housing the Kids when he finds the warden is a sadist...

There is a threat to Bogart's plan when the Kids escape as part of the warden's calculated attempt to prove Bogart's regenerative prison policies are valueless, but the ruse fails as Bogart gets the boys back winning the solemn recognition of merit...",1233360000,,560,4.762886597938144
1827817,5,B000085RPP,It's hard to believe this movie has not been released on DVD. Bogart is an Icon and to think that classic movies like this and the 'African Queen' have not been released is just insane and shameful! A crime indeed! I guess there is always hope as they finally released 'Somebody Up There Likes Me'(an early Newman classic)on DVD. Come on and bring the missing Bogart films and many other classics up to speed. ;-b,1166313600,2,413,4.52

This movie is great it shows the wide gap between the very rich and the very poor in Hells Kitchen. Bogart and the Dead End Kids do not need any pumping up their great. And Margerie Main (Ma Kettle) is downright scary. Not a lot of screen changes because this was a play before a movie.

1827825,4,B000085RPP,"CRIME SCHOOL (1938) gave Humphrey Bogart another chance to get beyond the bad guy roles he seemed trapped in. Here, he's  the newly-appointed Deputy Commissioner of Corrections, specifically for reformatories. The first such ""school"" Bogie visits is little more than a dingy 19th Century prison where a corrupt warden (Cy Kendall) and his assistant (Weldon Heyburn) steal funds, give the ""students"" rancid food, force them wear rags and sleep on ancient, worn out mattresses. If any kid makes trouble the warden whips him with a cat o' nine tails, then sends him to an infirmary run by a drunken ""doctor"" (Spencer Charters) who has no credentials for practicing medicine.

The Dead End Kids are all serving a two year stretch after one of them (Leo Gorcey) head bashes a junk dealer from behind and no one will rat him out. Bogart is at their hearing and he takes an interest in them. After learning that the gang's leader (Billy Halop) has been brutally lashed by the warden for an esacpe attempt and is lying untreated in the hospital, Bogie makes a clean sweep. He fires the warden, the head guard (who's the warden's brother-in-law), the pixillated quack physician and four ""screws"" with felony records.

Bogart assumes the duties of warden. He's clearly trying to improve conditions at the reform school, but the gang, and especially Halop, are certain that he's just another no-good ""copper."" How can he convince them otherwise, and can he do so with so many enemies inside and outside the school?

It's a competently made prison drama, with no ""Bowery Boys"" type goofiness beyond their calculated sabotaging of two coal-fired boilers and an exuberant painting party that gets out of hand. These pranks teach them all how childish behavior can have unforeseen consequences.

Also with Gale Page (as Halop's older sister), Huntz Hall, Bernard Punsley, Bobby Jordan and Gabe Dell, plus Charles Trowbridge (as the sentencing judge). Uncredited cameos from Clayton Moore and silent era comic Glen Cavender (he was one of the original Keystone cops).",1386806400,,2051,5.038348082595871
1827826,4,B000085RPP,"I really enjoyed the other reviews on this site, and agree with most of their insights. The individal showcase of the ""Kids"" acting is particularly good; and yes,the quality of the video is poor (must get remastered!)
I pose a question to other fans. My memory (of 30 years ago)differs a bit from the version (edited?) of the video I just watched. In particular, the whipping scene with Billy Halop - I remember actually seeing the warden raise the whip, followed by the shadows of the actual event. I also remember at their first meal, maggots being in the food, followed by Bogart actually stating ""there are maggots in this food"". That, (and perhaps other toned-down scenes?), may have made this version less hard-hitting than the original that I remember. It's still a great movie - but is this a ""PG"" version of the original, or am I just dreaming?",1374451200,,853,4.693333333333333
1827827,3,B000085RPP,"""Crime School"" came out in 1938 as a showcase for the ""Dead End"" kids, who helped make that movie a success the previous year.

A gang of six New York City teens - played by Billy Halop as the excitable leader, Leo Gorcy as the intense, bad one, and Bobby Jordan, Huntz Hall, Bernard Punsly, and Gabriel Dell as the other members - has been going around stealing items in the neighborhood and selling them to a pawn shop operator named Junkie (Frank Otto).  When a dispute arises on the gang's compensation, Gorcy injures Junkie, who complains to the police.  When none of the gang will tell the judge (Charles Trowbridge) anything, he sentences them all to two years of reform school.

The reform school turns out to be a beastly place, run by its superintendant, Mogan (Cy Kendall), and head guard, Cooper (Weldon Heyburn).  Discipline is strict, enforced by a whip and by coal-stoking duty.  Food quality is suspect.  Corners are cut.  Into this steps Humphrey Bogart as a new Deputy Commissioner making an inspection tour.  He has already met and formed a good opinion of the Halop's character's sister, Sue (Gale Page).  Bogart has a good initial run as a reformer, tossing out some of the crooks and incompetents.  When he gets to the accounting records, the Old Guard tries to use Bogart's relationship with Sue as a way to destabilize the new reform school inmates and to at least discredit Bogart.  How does this wind up?

The picture is a serviceably good black & white, although there is a steady stream of ignorable artifacts flowing through.  The sound it good, if unremarkable.  The gang acts up steadily, as people would expect from future Eastside Kids and Bowery Boys.  There is no bad language or sex.  Violence, drinking, and smoking are either brief or off-screen.  All of the gang members, plus a seasoned inmate, Red (George Offerman, Jr.), have shirtless scenes as a matter of reform school routine.  When Superintendant Morgan has the assembled student body recite the Pledge of Allegiance for Bogart, one notices that at that time the phrase ""under God"" was not included.  IMDB shows the film at 85 minutes, which is what my player timed it at too.

Warner Brothers had an interest in showing the value of rehabilitation and kindness to juvenile delinquents as being more effective than harsh punishments.  Bogart's character does end up with much success.  Some of the message is undercut by his sweeping some very bad gang behavior under the rug toward the end.  In today's ""lock 'em up and throw away the key"" environment, there is still some value in the message, and this movie is an entertaining way of receiving it.",1363305600,,2647,4.779735682819383
