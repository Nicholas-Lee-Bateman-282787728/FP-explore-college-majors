5425369,5,B00AHP15L6,"I love Leah Sarago's first three DVDs, which are very hard and intense, in a good way!  I was excited to see that she was coming out with this new whole-body workout, and pre-ordered it from her directly a few weeks back.  I was excited to try it out today, and love how fun it is and how quickly the time goes by while doing it!

To do this workout, you'll need a chair or barre, a yoga mat, and a set of 2-5-pound dumbbells.

The breakdown is as follows:

* Warm-up -- 5 minutes, incorporating dance-like movements, such as plies
* Upper Body --20 minutes, using the dumbbells and body-weight exercises
* Lower Body -- 20 minutes, using the chair or barre
* Core -- 20 minutes
* Cool Down/Stretch -- 10 minutes
* Instructional segment -- 12 minutes

As Leah explains in the introduction, this workout is less intense than her previous three DVDs since those split workouts focus an entire hour on one part of the body.  She suggests that you start with this one if you're new to Ballet Body, before progressing to the split workouts.  If you've been using Leah's DVDs or downloadable segments for awhile, though, I think you'll still find this to be a tough, solid workout.  It's a lot of fun and the time really moves quickly.

The menu also gives the option of playing the entire workout (all 75 minutes) or choosing certain segments.  The DVD is also chaptered, so you can skip ahead if you play the whole thing.

There is a 12-minute instructional segment where Leah gives a first-time Ballet Body participant form pointers.  Even though I've been using Leah's DVDs for about a year, I found the pointers to be good reminders.

The background music is also a bit dancey, and fun to listen to.  Leah is in amazing shape, and is very encouraging throughout the workout.

The only real negative is that the sound is a bit echo-y. It's worst in the Intro segment, but still there a bit in the workout segments themselves.  After about ten minutes into the workout, though, I stopped noticing it since I was fixating on my screaming muscles!  ;-)

On her website, she will be posting a rotation on how to use all four DVDs, but, as of my writing this review, it's not yet up.

Overall, this is another excellent DVD from Leah, and one that I'm glad to add to my collection!",1355961600,16,2274,4.460048426150121
5425370,5,B00AHP15L6,"I hope Leah makes more total body workouts like this. It is very time efficient, to the point, and VERY effective! Leah is the best! She's the best for a fabulous workout that doesn't bulk the female body!",1355875200,9,205,4.421052631578948
5425371,5,B00AHP15L6,"I was so excited to try this new workout from Leah Sarago. I completed the whole workout, and it is awesome! I'd rather have a total body workout on one dvd  than to have to piece together different segments myself. This workout is long-about 75 minutes-but the time flies. I felt every muscle was worked to exhaustion. It moves at a fast pace, but a controlled pace. I enjoyed every bit of it. I would rate this a high intermediate-advanced workout. I also love that there is no voice over in this one, as it seems more personable. The background music I would describe as remixed dance music. Different for a ""barre"" workout, but nice. I hope Leah comes out with more dvds like this one. I'd like to see her piece more of her segments in to dvd form, as I definitely feel challenged doing it myself. Love it!",1355875200,31,810,4.4
5425372,5,B00AHP15L6,Excellent workout. Works every part of your body.,1493510400,,49,5.25
5425373,5,B00AHP15L6,"I have the other 3 Ballet Body workouts. It took me a LONG TIME to get  into those because I wasn't fit enough to do them when they first came out. However things have changed since then. I am much fitter,stronger and more agile. This is a great workout. It's broken into 20 minute segments which makes it much easier to do.  I tend to like to mix up my workouts and switch  dvds and or elements. I am not a beginning to end person.  I would recommend that if you are new to Leah's workouts, do the warm-up and definitely do the instructional video at least twice (not twice in one workout  but  2 days in a row).  Your body will thank you for that.
Make sure you engage core at all times. You will have to modify because if your abs aren't strong enough or your legs can't go straight up into the air, that's ok. Just realize that this is a long term commitment to your health and your body.
I liked this workout a lot because she talks much more (but I agree on the echoing comment too because it's annoying)  I like that the moves are not just replicas of similar moves. These will challenge hips, abs, quads and lots more. Be Patient with what you can and can't do.
I  found her upper body workout to be so very challenging  because it actively engages core and upper body with movements.  If you find it hard to do, do less reps and  stop for a moment then pick it up again.  or do half the workout till you are able to do it easily.  The core workout section is  hard-- so make sure you adapt to it.  Keep pulling abs down (navel to spine) and then slide abs up  too.
Personally the music is OK but not great. I recognized songs but felt they were too loud in the background. I tend to focus on cueing.. and if the music is too  (fill in the blank), it's distracting.
 Do check out her other workouts. Sarrago is challenging, smart and great at cueing
  This makes for an interesting and useful workout and the core work is hard.",1492905600,4,1935,4.1617250673854445
5425374,5,B00AHP15L6,Best home workout video!,1492732800,,24,5.25
5425375,5,B00AHP15L6,"I adore this video! I've done the entire Ballet Body series and this is by far my favorite. The lower body video is the only one I don't like because it's hard on my creaky knees, but the lower body segment in this video doesn't give me any trouble (partly because it's shorter, I'm sure, but also because the moves are different and don't put as much pressure on my knees). It's effective and you definitely see results quickly, but I also love that it's enjoyable--strength training is definitely not my favorite part of working out, but this doesn't bore me. And it's challenging--I felt it the next day! I also like that I can get a full body workout in an hour (or in three 20-minute segments if I have a busy day and have to split it up) since my naturopath wants me to do two full body strength training sessions every week. Leah is pleasant and gives good instruction, including a separate segment on form that you can watch before you get started. Highly recommend!",1491177600,,974,4.477528089887641
5425376,4,B00AHP15L6,"Love Love Love the ab portion.  No crunches here!
Like the fact that I can pick and choose what portion of workout I can do.",1489276800,,124,3.96
5425377,5,B00AHP15L6,"So it's been a few months and I have been using Leah Sarago's DVD's only. I like this set of exercises a lot because each section  is intense (20 minutes) but the music ramps up as we near the end so it gives me a little encouragement to keep going. It is also a perfect workout if you start with the warm up and end with the stretching. When I have time I do one of the other DVD's, for example the Ab DVD, then finish out with legs and upper body. from the Total Body workout. This is a very good DVD. I don't like her ab section so much as I have an issue with holding my neck erect for abdominal crunches and this workout has one doing too many moves moves with an unsupported neck. I especially like the other workouts--they are shorter than the full length Leg, Ab and Upper body workouts. It is also very different from the aesthetically pleasing Leg, Ab,  and Upper body DVD's. You need a chair or a bar to perform the leg work. Ultimately though, this workout made my arms sore and I felt the work on all levels. I want more from Sarago.",1471910400,,1046,4.122549019607843
5425378,3,B00AHP15L6,"The other videos in this series, upper body, core and legs seem more beneficial and easier to follow. This one is different, not in the best way. I suppose I will get used to it.",1462320000,,178,4.114285714285714

5425382,5,B00AHP15L6,I love her workouts!!!  I can really feel my muscles working when I do them.,1448841600,,76,4.066666666666666
5425383,4,B00AHP15L6,"Solid barre workout - in my opinion intermediate level.  Covers total body just as the title states; and love that each section is broken up into 20 minute segments so you do have choice to do just part or all of the workouts.  All sections are thorough and give a solid burn; however, I will be using the Core and Lower Body sections more than the Upper Body as I injured my right arm years ago and it fatigues very easily.  The Upper Body section is great workout, but it has quite a bit of planks and positions that require arm strength - I found 20 minutes of this too much for my right arm.",1446336000,3,595,4.156521739130435
5425384,5,B00AHP15L6,"I took ballet when I was a child, and really wish I'd kept with it.  I'm looking forward to working out with this DVD and getting some semblance of a ""Ballet Body"" to get and stay in shape.  This, and the other Ballet Body DVD's look like they can do it for me.",1434585600,,261,3.9056603773584904
5425385,1,B00AHP15L6,I was so disappointed.,1433116800,,22,4.75
5425386,5,B00AHP15L6,"I have all three of Leah's other Ballet Body videos (Upper, Lower, Core) but admit that they were all bit too long for me and that I wanted something that focused on the total body rather that certain sections.  This DVD fits the bill!  I could not for the life of me get through her Upper Body disc and although the arms on this one are challenging they are do-able; hopefully in time I'll be able to complete the full Upper Body disk with the help of this shorter, yet still not easy, segment.  I found it MUCH easier on the wrists.  The lower body portion wasn't too difficult for me but it got the job done.  I never thought I'd type these words but I absolutely LOVE the core work.  I typically groan when I see anything having to do with abs but these exercises were actually fun (again, I can't believe I'm writing ""fun abs!"").  They are very creative and hit my main trouble spot - the dreaded lower belly pooch.  My two problem areas are the tummy and upper arms and this DVD hits both perfectly.

I wasn't at all bothered by the ""echo"" others mentioned since I was more focused on the moves and I enjoyed the club style music.  I also liked that she didn't provide voice-over instruction, as she did with her other DVDs.  I'm no fan of voice-overs because I always felt like the instructor wasn't really ""there"" with you.  That's not the case here.

This DVD is by far my favorite of her Ballet Body series and while I hope to take up the others again (although I dread the voice-overs and blah music) I know I'll stick with this one for quite a while.  Highly recommend!",1431993600,10,1581,4.315254237288135
5425387,5,B00AHP15L6,"Great Workout!  Leah definitely plugged in some amazing exercises to get you into shape.  It will definitely be tough for beginner but not impossible.  Follow the modifications if you need to and eventually you will get there.  Even after doing Leah's programs for more than a year, this definitely got my heart rate and sweat on!",1431475200,2,330,4.839285714285714

5425392,5,B00AHP15L6,"I always loved ballet and have been out of it for some time, this workout video was fantastic. The moves were easy to do, but I could still feel it the next day. Time went by fast and I didn't find myself trying to look at the clock to see how much time was left. I look forward to trying more of the Ballet Body series. This is a must have workout DVD!",1418947200,,353,3.8493150684931505
5425393,5,B00AHP15L6,Can't get enough of this video! I feel and look amazing after 4 kids. Thanks Leah.,1418860800,,82,4.1875
5425394,2,B00AHP15L6,"I wanted a real ballet workout, like a real ballet class. This presentation is completely misleading. This is not really ballet. It's a workout with pseudo ballet moves.",1409961600,4,169,5.071428571428571
5425395,5,B00AHP15L6,"I have been working out at home for over 10 years now and own approximately 50 workout DVDs, 10 of which are ballet/barre workouts. I started barre about a year ago. This DVD is AMAZING!  I don't know why I waited so long to order it.  The upper and lower body segments are 20 minutes each, perfect for fitting in a morning workout; they are the most efficient 20 minute workouts I have ever come across.  The abs segment is great because most of the exercises were new to me, so it keeps me interested (abs are my least favorite).  I also owner the lower body and upper body DVDs from Leah-  I was pleasantly surprised to to find out that Total Body has completely different exercises than the other DVDs I own, making it worth every penny!

The instruction/narration is great.  The other Ballet Body DVDs have voice-over narration; this one does not and it is much better.  Plus Leah really makes you feel like you are training to be a dancer in this one, its nice.

Last, but not least, the music in this is AWESOME!  It is toned-down club music and motivates me to keep going so I can look better the next time I go out on the town.  Not to mention, it makes 20 minutes go by in no time!  Come to think of it, this has the best music of any workout DVD I have ever come across.

If you are new to ballet/barre, I would highly recommend this dvd over all others.  There is a great 12 tutorial on form.  You learn quickly that form is everything in this practice.  Also, the exercises in this DVD are a lot more modification-friendly compared to the other Ballet Body DVDs.  Not to forget that Leah's instruction is very thorough and she will remind you at the right monuments to re-check your form.

Overall, this is a must have for all!",1408924800,40,1740,4.3015384615384615
5425396,5,B00AHP15L6,"I consider myself at an intermediate to advanced fitness level.  This DVD far exceeded my expectations.  It's tough but I feel excellent after the work out...charged-not drained and very flexible.
 I have a bad hip and have lost some range of motion through the years.  After doing this workout my hips feel like they have more flexiblity.  I credit that to the lower body workout section of this DVD...the movements not only strengthen but stretch the muscles at the same time.
Love Leah's workouts...keep them coming!",1403395200,5,519,4.988372093023256
5425397,4,B00AHP15L6,This was a good workout. I was sore the day after I did it and I enjoyed the different sections.,1399248000,,96,3.85
5425398,5,B00AHP15L6,"This is an effective, fun workout.  I enjoy doing it just as much as Leah's other DVDs.  Her moves are well prompted and tough.  They deliver results.  It is time consuming - 20 minutes for each: arms, legs, and core, plus a cool down.  I usually choose  2 sections to do a night.
If you're looking for another really good workout from Leah, give this one a try.  I don't think you'd be disappointed.
I'd like to respond to 2 comments made by other reviewers.  First, that the exercises on the DVD are the same as on Leah's other DVDs. I don't agree.  I applauded Leah's innovative moves on her legs and core DVD and wondered what I'd find with the Total Body DVD.  The moves are different and they work.
Second, there is a bit of a tinny sound, or echo on the DVD.  True. The sound's  not too bad.  Anyone old enough to remember the first Charlie and the Chocolate Factory movie might remember the TV Mike scene and get nostalgic.",1398556800,7,931,4.312138728323699

5425400,5,B00AHP15L6,"I have all of the individual ballet body DVDs (core, upper & lower).  This one is a tiny bit easier than the individual workouts-- probably just because of the shorter segments, but it still is very challenging.  I find the music very motivating and the instruction is perfect.  The set and echo did not bother me; I care more about the workout.  You can choose what segments to do or go for the full 75 minutes.  When I do the entire dvd, I feel as though every muscle has been worked.  Leah is a fantastic instructor and the time flies by.  Leah packed a ton of value into this dvd; don't let the length discourage you-- you can always chose to do the shorter segments depending on your time constraints.  I highly recommend this dvd, and wish Leah would come out with more.",1396137600,4,776,4.3776223776223775

5425405,5,B00AHP15L6,"I have done this video, or should state, parts of it many times now over a few months. This video is my first Barre experience. Was working full-time and gone 10 hours a day, so if I could even get a 20 minute segment in I was happy. No dread factor, because I like it and feel worked in 20 minutes. Needed to do something, as I had been working way too hard, and for years on my desk job body. (A job I that I no longer have due to refusing a flu shot at work due because of a previous adverse reaction- Anyway.) Could feel and see improvement in strength, tone and energy even by doing 20 minutes maybe 3 days a week. I have never completed the entire video in 1 session. So look forward to further improvement in my fitness, by in part, using this video. And will do the whole video when I am that strong and full of energy. Yesterday I started a different Barre video that was too much, then shut it off and reverted back to this one. Personally like a video that is hard to finish. I have other videos I can finish the first try with my desk body and I want more challenge than that. Would say the level of this video is moderate to advanced depending how hard you work. Easily gave results in a short time, I didn't have time to waste. Very effective use of exercise time. Love the lengthening and strengthening. More elite athletes may rate this easier.
Am excited that I can still try other Leah Sarago videos suggested by other review(s) and expect I will. Is a bummer the sound quality isn't better, but it's tolerable. And the beat of the music is noticeably helpful at times to keep the pace and finish a sequence.
My family is sometimes around when I am doing the leg section, they tease me about using my, ""Steaming glute,"" when she is actually saying, ""Standing glute."" Does sound like she is saying steaming. My glute usually is standing and steaming. Most used exercise video of 2013 at the unemployed nurse's home! Whoot-whoot!  Goal of: Daddy's arm candy.

5425406,4,B00AHP15L6,"I bought this because I wanted to try the series before committing to the 3 full-length DVDs. It is a great intro to the Ballet Body series- there is a 20 minute abs segment, a 20 minute upper body segment, and a 20 minute lower body segment, so you get a little of everything. There's also a separate warmup and cooldown- so you can do all the segments together as one workout or just do one at a time if you don't have an hour to spend. I'm in pretty good shape and really like the ExtendBarre and Ballet Beautiful DVDs: this one is a little reminiscent of Mary Helen Bowers (ie lots of reps of little movements) but faster-paced with up-tempo modern music (it's actually Top 40 stuff sung by fake cover artists- sounds ok for now but in a year or two it will sound super dated!). You'll definitely feel these workouts- they're the kind that make you shake while you're moving! But they're short enough and Leah is encouraging enough that you can push through the tough parts. I don't know that they burn a ton of calories- I always do them as a strength workout after cardio- they seem like they'll tighten you without adding muscle bulk if you're already a healthy weight. I use them 1-2 times a week with a mix of weights, running, elliptical, biking, and other home DVDs so I can't attest to the results you'd get if you used them exclusively and regularly as your only workout. I like this because I wish I was a ballet dancer, it's quick if you only have time to do one segment, and you'll sweat and feel like you're getting a workout. I like it well enough that I'm planning to buy the three separate Ballet Body DVDs.",1376784000,6,1627,4.355263157894737

I do swimming for an hour three times a week for my cardio and added Total Body DVD to the days between it. Based on the Leah's Workout Guide which can be downloaded from her website, I need to do this workout for 4 weeks before incorporating other 3. I tried them all already before finding this guide. Love them all equally. I don't know why people complain about the ""voice over"" on other workouts because I like it. In my opinion, you don't get tired of the same jokes and phrases like from other workouts. I think she is very professional. Great job Leah. You found another fan.",1374883200,6,751,4.449275362318841

It can be also done in a very small space and you don't need tons of equipment, which makes it something you can bring along if you are traveling or live in an apartment.

I like this one because there are three 20 minute workouts.  One for the core, one for the upper body and one for the lower body.  Then there is a 5 minute warm up and a cool down also.  I use these workouts separately if I need a short workout afterwork.  I do the warm up and one of the 20 minute workouts.  They are challenging but doable.  I love the ballet workouts because they are so different.  You are using your own body to provide the weight resistance.  The moves are very feminine and fluid and Leah is an excellent coach.  She is so inspiring.  In this workout she is more animated and personable.  The set is brighter than in the other videos.  There is an annoying echo in this workout but you forget about it pretty fast.  Definetely try this workout!!",1368489600,11,918,4.311764705882353
5425415,1,B00AHP15L6,"Without coming off as too catty, let me say my first indication that this series wasn't for me should have been Leah herself: the lady has a great body and an obvious knowledge of fitness, but she ain't a ballerina. The length, grace and toned-but-ultra-feminine look of all pro ballerinas is very much missing here and I don't think Leah's workouts would ever give you that effect, if that's what you're going for. I got this dvd because I was so impressed by the ballet-based workouts of Mary Helen Bowers (""Ballet Beautiful"" brand) and I feel like this ""Ballet Body"" line is just blatantly capitalizing on the popularity of Black Swan, MHB, ballet workouts in general at the moment, without really offering ballet knowledge or techniques. I think it mentions somewhere on this dvd that Leah has trained NFL players? But I didn't see any mention of her ever having anything to do with ballet or ballerinas.

I like it very much, the only down side i have to address is the cuing and the background noise. in some areas of the dvd, her cuing was a bit too fast paced, it didn't give you enough time to work on the next move which i found a little frustrating unlike the other ballet body dvd's where she gives you a enough seconds to get ready for the next phase. Also i don't understand why they couldn't have helped mute or muffle out the background noise in the video. Every time Leah talked all you heard was this deep echo-y sound of her voice amplifying in the studio she was exercising, and it kinda was distracting a bit, but over all it was a very good work out. I only did the leg segment of this video, and i can't wait to do the other 20 minute areas in this dvd. i would definitely recommend this to anyone.",1361059200,5,1031,4.134328358208955
5425424,3,B00AHP15L6,"After just having completed this workout, I have mixed feelings about it.  I do feel it is an effective barre workout with a lot of creative twists.  I'm definitely feeling it in all my muscle groups.  However, there are pros and cons for me.

Cons:
The workout clocks in at around 75 minutes.  I have had very tough and effective barre workouts that are 45- to 60-minutes in length, and going over an hour makes it difficult to fit it into a busy schedule.  Yes, you can break it up into parts; however, that rather defeats the idea of a total-body workout.

The white walls/floors are eerie and have a disorientating and disembodied effect. I would prefer a simple studio over this type of setting.

There was a terrible echo-like sound throughout the workout that was very distracting.

Pros:
Great music.  Leah used upbeat, contemporary music with a lot of vocals.  So many instructors/producers of fitness DVDs use such bland music, so kudos to Ms. Sarago for carefully selecting motivating music.

Although the workout is long, it does not feel long.  No dread factor when it comes to the exercises themselves even though my muscles feel like they are deeply worked out.

Live cueing.  I prefer it over voiceover.

Creative, fun warm-up; not your standard barre version.

In all, I struggled whether to give it three stars or four stars.  It is an excellent workout overall, but the long length and distracting production elements will probably mean that I will not be reaching for this workout often.",1360540800,85,1507,4.797665369649805

The videos are well produced & Leah is a great instructor. She tells you what you need to know w.o being verbose.

I just did this DVD last nite & loved it as well. Definitely more produced than prior videos & I prefer to more subdued look on Leah but its still great!

Different moves from the separate DVDs & still very challenging. I always feel amazing the day after one of her workouts & same applies to this one.

The core I didn't love, but thought I'd get there after awhile...when I heard the total body DVD was coming out, I preordered it from her website and counted the days till it arrived. I tried contacting her thru her website to figure out just where this DVD would fit into a rotation but never heard back...anyway. I have tried this DVD a few times and it's just blah. Not enough of anything to get a good workout in. I feel like she used all her best ideas for the other DVDs and this was just an after thought. It is too easy for anyone who workouts regularly, especially if you have been doing her other DVDs. I do plenty of other barre workouts that do work every part well, so it is not because there isn't time to work them in an hour - its that this DVD doesn't do it.

There are production issues as well (weird muffled music and she loses her voice/microphone issues) but I could overlook those if I loved this workout. Anyway, I'm still giving it two stars because I think if you were just getting started with barre-inspired workouts (this is NOT barre) or Leah in particular, this might be a good option to see if it is even something you like. I really like the other DVDs and her creative workout style, but this is not a great DVD.",1357430400,55,1342,4.221789883268483

It is perfect to use on days when I'm busy with work and don't have time to do the full length one of her other three excellent workout DVDs that each work a different body part. ( I have them all). I find that my body still gets a good workout if I pick out an area of the body to work on, upper body, core or lower body from this DVD.

I've been doing Leah's DVDs for the past few months and my arms are a lot more toned and my abs are flatter and my butt is more lifted. I especially like the music in this DVD and I find that the 20 minute sections just fly by. I'm hoping that Leah comes out with many more DVDs in the future.  Leah's DVDs are an excellent investment.",1357257600,7,718,3.910958904109589
5425430,4,B00AHP15L6,"I already have the three other Ballet Body DVD's and this is great when you want a concentrated full-body workout in 75 minutes, or for someone new to the Ballet Body series as I consider the first three DVD's more of an in intermediate workout versus a beginners, which is what this is. I pre-ordered this directly from Ballet Body when I heard there was a new-release, so I wasn't sure what to expect. Here is what you get on the DVD:

Warm Up - 5 minutes
Upper Body - 20 minutes
Lower Body - 20 minutes
Core - 20 minutes
Cool Down/Stretch  - 10 minutes
Instructional - 12 minutes

Pros: I definitely recommend you start out with the instructional as it shows modifications not shown in the main body of the DVD. I have weak shoulder muscles, and this was very helpful. I have a hard time doing the Ballet Body Upper Body DVD because of my muscle weakness, and I think this will be a great starting point for me to build up muscle strength and get to the point of being able to being able to perform all of the moves in the other DVD (for me, the ones primarily done in plank pose). The upper body portion of this workout is something I can see myself doing several times a week to work on my shoulder strength.

The remainder of the DVD is a good introduction to the Ballet Body moves, although not nearly as intense. It doesn't need to be to get a good workout in! Your lower body and core will feel the effects. This is an excellent overall body workout. I do miss the stretching at the end of each body segment. There is a full body stretch segment at the end of the workout.

Cons: For me, what keeps this from being a five star review is not the workout itself, but a couple of annoyance factors. There is a fairly lengthy introduction to Ballet Body done by Leah Sarago that can't be skipped (on my DVD player, it can on my computer for some reason?). I work out first thing in the morning and don't have extra time for that. If I'm semi-coherent, I go start a load of laundry....but that's not always the case at 5 am. The other thing I don't like about this DVD is that there is a heavy reverb, or echo throughout the entire DVD. It's just not my taste. None of the other Ballet Body DVD's use this. I don't know if it was done to give it a DJ-like effect to match the club-style music? It just ends up being annoying.

Overall: Don't let my con's dissuade you from purchasing this amazing workout. I feel I need to mention them so that hopefully those that make and edit these type of workout DVD's will consider these factors when creating them. I get great results from the Ballet Body system and am considering purchase of the periodization system in the near future as i think it will help me achieve my fitness goals.

5425431,5,B00AHP15L6,"In short - awesome!! I love Leah doing live cueing (although it is a little echo-y, which may irritate some) and this is a really nicely balanced workout. I wish she'd put in some short stretches during all the plank work, but the 20 minutes of upper body work fried my arms. The lower body work is nicely balanced, and for once I actually really liked the core section (usually core is my least favourite part of barre DVDs, as most are too fast, too long in c-curve and too big in range of movement). The pacing is great (not too fast, not too fast, juuuuuuust right) and every body part was worked to point of fatigue, without reaching agony.

I really liked the music (club style stuff), but think whoever did Leah's make-up should be shot. Leah is far too beautiful to need that much make-up plastered on.

Even though this isn't as ""intense"" as the other three Ballet Body DVDs, since you're not just working one area for 40+ minutes, if you use good technique this is still a serious workout. Leah's creativity never fails to amaze.

8551727,3,B00AHP15L6,"I'm a big fan of ballet/barre, Pilates and yoga, so I thought I would love this workout. I didn't.

Here are the negatives:
1) Productive quality is low. There is a distracting white back-ground, as other reviewers have noted. The presenter also has a bad tan and extremely heavy eye makeup to the point of distraction too. The music is good, but oddly chosen--it does not really match the video. By far the worst though is whatever camera man they hired. The image scopes in and out at odd times, and makes it hard to follow along, especially when you lose the view of her body. Notably, this is worst in the warm-up and gets better, but it is still just unacceptable for a professional exercise video.

2) There is not nearly enough instruction on form and alignment. In fact, for most exercises there is none. You just have to follow what you see, even though they are complex moves.

3) The first 10 minutes of the upper body section are asking for injury. Even if you are fit, and familiar with form and alignment generally to protect your shoulders (which I am), you are putting a huge amount of pressure on your wrists. Combined with the lack of instruction on alignment and lakc of offered modifications, someone is going to get hurt.

4) This is not a ""ballet"" workout. It has some fusion moves that look ballet-inspired, but you can find much better authentic ballet workouts, like Mary Helen Bowers' Ballet Beautiful. This is more like a barre fusion by an instructor who is not seriously ballet-trained. Fine, if that is what you are looking for but not what was advertised.

I am still giving it three stars, because it did get better in the lower body/core sections, and the ending stretch was good. I would repeat those segments and maybe parts of upper body, but this is not a favorite. If I had it to do again, I would make another purchase. And I would specifically warn friends against this video unless they are already familiar with barre and have no known wrist problems.",1515801600,3,1993,4.587078651685394

I've had a variety of good (and not so good) Pilates instructors at various gyms over the years and was looking for a good video so I could exercise at home periodically.  My sister and I tried this out while vacationing and neither one of us cared for it.  It was challenging, but rather hard to follow along to and the directions were not as explicit as they could have been.  We're swimmers so we do have some coordination in the water, but you'd never guess that we were doing the same exercise video on land.  We just couldn't get the moves down without stopping to watch the television, and even then we still didn't get it.  I decided to return the video because I sensed I would never play it at home, and $5 was deducted when I shipped it back.  Then another $7 was deducted because I had opened the package.  At that rate, I should have just kept the dumb DVD because I was refunded about $4 total.  I've never had return issues with Amazon but this makes me hesitant to buy any kind of exercise DVD unless I watch YouTube videos first to see if I even like the instructor.",1510012800,4,1179,4.274774774774775

8551734,5,B00AHP15L6,"I absolutely love this workout. I would classify this as a barre workout - the movements are controlled and precise, and while she emphasizes posture, there's no dancing or jumping involved. I took Pure Barre classes for 2 years and think this workout is MUCH tougher than those for the upper body and core sections, as well as thighs, although not as tough on the seat. I love Cathe Friedrich's Turbo Barre workout, and this one is even harder than Cathe's. I haven't watched the instructional segment or the cool-down segment as I am impatient - I just do the warmup, upper body, lower body, and core sections.

This routine has zero impact and the moves are all accessible, not requiring much flexibility or strength, or any dance experience, to get into - but between all the reps and the multiple exercises for each muscle group, they will get your heart rate up, make your muscles burn, tire you out, and leave you sore the next day. The upper body and core sections are very intense, but again, accessible - I can get into every position, and just do as many reps as I can. The core workout works your lower back really well, in addition to your abs. I don't find the lower body section as challenging, although that tends to be my strongest area anyway (schoolteacher) - but it's still a great workout for thighs and glutes.

Leah is a great instructor - she's very clear and easy to follow, and never gets annoyingly chatty. The pace is quick enough that you can really clear your mind and focus on the workout without getting distracted. The music is fun and high-energy (a little dated, but still good). I love that despite the name, nothing is overly balletic - I have no dance background and no wish to become a dancer. She offers modifications as you go that are great, so beginners can still get a lot out of this workout.",1496707200,,1837,4.530120481927711
