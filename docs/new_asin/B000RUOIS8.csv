8202539,5,B000RUOIS8,"I've owned yo-yos for 50 years but never took the time to really learn how to play. When I decided to learn about various types and qualities of yo-yos I chose to buy a DVD rather than brows the masses of videos on Youtube. For me this was a good decision. This DVD has a nice amount of history, description of yoyo types, video of professionals, and basic lessons. Production and video quality is not always the greatest but content is fine and the price is cheap. I'll take this over a slick production at twice the price. Most importantly, I would buy it again. I guess that is the mark of a good item.",1457308800,,605,4.269565217391304

This video was great for my 7 year old son and I to watch while ""playing"". A very good video if you're a player or a budding collector.",1198800000,,272,4.055555555555555
