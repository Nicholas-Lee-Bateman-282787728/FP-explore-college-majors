2334594,5,B0009XRZQK,"Memories of Murder is the best film I've seen from Korea so far. Don't expect an action-packed cop thriller: this story of the botched investigation into South Korea's first serial killer is much more of a character-driven drama. As the bodies mount up, the local cops are joined by a city cop, setting the scene for a clash between brute force - Kang-ho Song's local tortures suspects and plants evidence because that's the way things have always been done - and intellect - Sang-kyum Kim believes that documents never lie and relies more on tracing patterns. To a degree, the narrative betrays a similar tension, with chases and beatings alternating with throwaway scenes highlighting the sheer incompetence of the investigation (the local police haven't bothered to read the forensic reports and they even try to frame the only witness, while they're unable to prevent more killings because the manpower they need is diverted to suppressing pro-democracy rallies). But it's not that simple: no sooner has one approach been finally been comprehensively disproved than the other is found equally lacking, and as no progress is made the detectives turn on each other and then themselves.

It takes a while hitting its stride, but when it does it delivers some powerful blows, and the look of hopeless impotence on Kang-ho Song's face that ends the picture is the most haunting image I've seen on film this year.",1131667200,,1411,5.004255319148936
2334595,5,B0009XRZQK,"Memories of Murder is a good, concise murder mystery. It's a true story set in South Korea and will keep you guessing until the end. Though sometimes slow (at 2 hours plus) it's still interesting and will keep you engaged. Graphic and real; two qualities of any good mystery.",1130803200,3,275,4.63265306122449
2334596,5,B0009XRZQK,"Memories of Murder is a grade A Korean Movie! Once I saw that UMVD was releasing it on R1 DVD I was so excited! It is an amazing film by Joon-ho Bong.

Bong manages to mix the comedy and the suspense to a decent level. You are laughing at the darkest comedic things possible and still waiting in suspense for the suspect to confess everything even though we know that the real killer was never caught...and he is still loose!

i've seen other Korean films and I am a little sketchy when I watch them, but this film won several awards in Asia and was a big hit. If you are in the mood for a suspenseful movie that has some comedic and good acting - check this movie out.

The extra features on this DVD aren't the best - but they are better than I hoped for. The interviews with the cast are all provided with subtitles - so you can laugh together with Song Kang-ho and others! And it was intersting to learn more about them since they seem to be popular actors in Asia, but aren't as known here in the US. Song Kang-ho was also in JSA - if anyone else saw that movie!",1125964800,6,1067,4.1201923076923075
2334597,3,B0009XRZQK,"A good movie based on a series of murders committed in Korea in 1986.  Good acting by the cast. This film and a few other recent ones shows that South Korean film-makers are appealing to broader international audiences. Has humor, suspense, action, and tragedy. Portrayal of police brutality of suspects might offend some viewers, but it's consistent with the known tactics that were practiced and tolerated at that time by Korean law enforcement. 3+ stars.

2334598,5,B0009XRZQK,"In the 1986 when South Korea was under totalitarian rule there was a series of grisly murders of young women in a rural area.  The rural police used unconventional methods in order to attempt to uncover the identity of the killer after they discovered the first body.  When a second body is discovered a police officer from Seoul is sent to help with the investigation, but the rural police become more crude in their methods.  This leads to a further distrust of the police force as it begins to cloud the police force's own judgment as more bodies are discovered.  Memories of Murder is an interesting investigation story that displays a societal phenomenon of the rural area that is plagued of poor policing and a murderer.  The director Joon-ho Bong creates an intelligent and brilliant cinematic experience as he reveals the truth behind a true event that took place in South Korea in 1986.",1121385600,21,895,4.785714285714286
2334599,5,B0009XRZQK,"Heads up, everyone! Despite the fact that Nancy Allen is listed here by amazon.com as starring in this film, she most definitely does not. The film being advertised here as due to be released on DVD in August 2005 in the U.S. is a Korean film originally released overseas in 2003 under the title ""Salinui Chueok,"" its title in English being ""Memories of Murder."" It's an amazing, unique, intense, sometimes hilarious, always fiercely intelligent murder mystery from the powerful young Korean director Joon-ho Bong and features a 100% Korean cast speaking Korean (with English subtitles). Nancy Allen only wishes she'd been in this movie!

A few hours ago I was in the grip of insomnia and was playing around with Comcast On Demand to see if there was anything worth seeing that I hadn't seen already when I noticed a section under Free Movies called ""Palm Pictures,"" a section I hadn't explored before. I clicked on ""Palm Pictures,"" then on ""Palm Festival,"" saw ""Memories of Murder"" listed, read the brief synopsis, and figured, what the heck, there's no better time to watch a Korean film than 2 a.m., so I went for it, figuring it wouldn't be a tragedy if I wound up dozing off ...

Not a chance! I was wide-eyed with my mouth open from beginning to end. Never even made it to the fridge. Forgot all about eating, drinking, or even breathing at times, and sleep was definitely not an option. Once the end credits rolled, I was hurtling toward my computer with one question in my mind: ""Who is this astounding dude Joon-ho Bong, and where oh where can I buy a DVD of this movie?""

Well ... turns out you can find inexpensive DVDs of Joon-ho Bong's ""Memories of Murder"" on eBay, but I think they're Region 0 imports, which isn't saying they're bad necessarily, but now that I've discovered that a Region 1 DVD is coming out in the U.S. a scant few weeks from now, I'm holding out for it. I only hope it has all of the special features (interviews with the director and the actors, special effects commentary, an alternate ending, some discussion of the actual murders in Korea upon which the film's story was based, etc.) I've seen mentioned on the Internet as being present on the European and Asian DVDs.

What an eye-opener this film was for me! Superb acting. Gorgeous photography. Slightly improbable plot in parts, but I doubt you'll care; I sure didn't. ""Silence of the Lambs"" was improbable in parts as well but was still riveting. I found the Korean language in this film fascinating to listen to and wasn't bugged by the subtitles at all. In fact, half the time I forgot to read the subtitles because whatever I needed to know was all in the actors' faces and in the landscape ... and what faces! What a landscape!

Oh, and Nancy Allen actually did appear in a mediocre 1990 made-for-TV movie called ""Memories of Murder,"" but it's not the same as Joon-ho Bong's blockbuster Korean hit ""Memories of Murder"" from 2003, so be careful when you order, and please see the terrific review (wish I'd written it!) of Joon-ho Bong's ""Memories of Murder"" at the IMDb website for more details.

Whatever you do, don't miss this film!",1121385600,44,3131,4.6528028933092225

2334624,5,B0009XRZQK,"In watching this movie I felt almost giddy. Certainly not because of the grisly subject matter: a series of brutal rape/murders in rural Korea. No, it had to do with the fact that I honestly felt that I had discovered an entirely new and unique universe of incredible, unusual, riveting, magnificent, expertly-crafted films. Sadly, I have not seen all that many Asian films. I am an old man of 65 and have been a movie lover my entire life. I greatly enjoy foreign (non-US) movies because it is an opportunity to get a glimpse of different ways of life, to see places I'll probably never see, and, particularly with the action/crime genre, to vicariously experience things I'll gladly avoid in real life.

Apparently there actually did occur in Korea a series of these murders. I don't know anything about them, so I do not know how close to reality this movie is. The rural cops find the bound body of a young, beautiful woman in a drainage culvert. This shockingly brutal and unusual crime demands action and results, and the overmatched detectives stop at nothing--not even beatings and torture--to pin the crime on some poor sod, and to get a confession. The main detective, the chubby, rough-around-the-edges Park Doo-Man, is played by the amazingly talented megastar Kang-ho Song, who is as good as any of our much better-known actors.  Another detective, the cerebral Seo Tae-Yoon (played by yet another huge Asian star, Sang-kyung Kim)  is sent from the big city--Seoul--to help out the country bumpkins. Several times Detective Seo, through shrewd, dogged work, determines that the supposed perpetrators are actually innocent. Of course, his mere presence is greatly resented by the rugged Park; then to have him swoop in just as Park is getting yet another confession, is hugely irritating to Park.

The victims are all beautiful young women, most wearing red, all killed at night, in the rain, and all after a certain song has been requested and played on the radio. The film has moments of supreme humor, fantastic acting, and a tremendously enthralling story. At the end of the film we even go fifteen or twenty years ahead, from the time of the murders. Most impressive of all is the way it intelligently presents the lives of the police, focusing on Park, and the toll it takes on his life, as the murders continue to go on....and on. Kang-ho Song is truly an actor of the first rank, and I plan to see as many of his films as I can.

The title of my review comes from a line in the movie. Park's girlfriend has just told him that he looks pale, tired, like a corpse. She asks him, ""Aren't you sleeping at night?"" The title is his terse, hard-bitten reply.

The movie is as suspenseful and exciting as any I have seen in many years. It is just a shame that it will not be seen by many Americans, simply because of prejudice, and ignorance. Not racial prejudice necessarily, but prejudice against foreign films, foreign languages, foreign actors and the reading of subtitles. If we could get past some of these biases, we'd be richly rewarded with a unique film-going experience. What happens too often is that great foreign films are remade for the US market, and, almost invariably, the remakes are vastly inferior to the original. Americans are assumed to be too parochial and narrow-minded--and it's probably true--to appreciate foreign films and television on their own merit. So producers, with an eye on potential box office returns, decide to remake the foreign hit, hoping to duplicate the success. Let the Right One In, an incredibly unique, original and innovative ""horror/drama"" from Sweden, is remade in the US as Let Me In. There are countless other examples. I urge you to see these great original films, and many of these wonderful movies and actors are coming from Asia, such as Memories of Murder.",1422489600,5,3829,4.811550151975684

2334627,3,B0009XRZQK,"This movie seemed a little 'too loose' for me to fully appreciate. Kang-ho Song is excellent as a jaded detective that suddenly has his eyes opened by this new style of crime in his jurisdiction. But much of the police work comes off as 'Keystone Cops', and is difficult to laugh at, given the subject matter. Yet I have to give Joon-ho Bong credit for trying to put the humorous element into it. It definitely goes 'from one extreme to another' in laughter and intrigue. And the end will leave one guessing as much as Jack The Ripper. For fans of David Lynch, Wim Wenders, and The Coen bro's. Joon-ho Bong fits right in with them, and stands out uniquely amongst them as well.",1408665600,,677,4.467741935483871
2334628,2,B0009XRZQK,"Maybe it was the abject stupidity of the police that irritated me the most.  I can accept that police torture people and maybe this is commonplace in Korea.  But at times, I felt I was watching the 3 Stooges. The police were so bad at their jobs that I thought it was a comedy at times.  Did the director do this on purpose to mock the actual investigative work?  If this was his intent, then he went too far and made the movie ridiculous.  The acting was amateurish, though it had its moments.

Also, if I'm going to watch a foreign film, then I want to hear the native tongue of the actors and not some American dub over.  And, what if a Korean wants to hear it in Korean?  Can't do it, not with this Palm Pictures kluge.",1396137600,,723,4.151079136690647

2334637,5,B0009XRZQK,"This is a movie everyone should see. Funny, engaging, violent, heartrending were thoughts that came to me after seeing Memories of Murder. These are not usually the diversity of emotions I've seen in most movies, and even rarer in crime dramas, but they reflect an extremely well-done movie by Joon-Ho Bong.

At times, it's early pacing can feel slow, much slower than an average crime drama. Bong allows us into the world by taking a decent amount of time to familiarize us with the environment: a boring, quiet country beauty that he paints for us long, deliberate shots presented very early in the movie. The soundtrack, a quiet but moving score, adds to an environment and a feel that is very real, very universal. But as soon as the action starts picking up, the movie ramps into a full-on thriller, as it becomes a race against time and feels very much like some of the best crime drama/thrillers I've seen. At the same time, there is something intangible, something very (for lack of better words) sad and melancholic that permeates through many parts of the movie. Dilapidated factories, protesters, corruption, periods of senseless violence suggest a deeper meaning within the movie, a desperation and hopelessness of that time in Korea.

But thankfully, Bong keeps this underlying part of the movie simple without becoming unnecessarily preachy. Although it is important to contextualize this film within a certain era of governmental corruption and crime in Korea, it certainly does not require an extensive knowledge of the turbulent time period in Korea. Personally, I did not find it's overall sentiments propagandizing or overwhelming, rather they were quietly presented.

I could go on about more specific parts of the plot, but it is a movie which I do not want to spoil. Simply put, it has all the elements of a great movie. Highly recommended!",1339632000,11,1862,4.980707395498392

You can see him honing his craft here. It has much of the style, content and approach of his later films but it's not quite as refined. This is not to say it's rough. It isn't. But were you to view this back to back with his later ""Mother"" you'd see the difference in execution immediately.

A particular South Korean town finds itself under the stress of having its first serial killer. The local detectives really aren't that good and have no experience with this level of crime. In comes a helping hand from the big city and they try to unravel the mystery. They work tirelessly but their efforts don't pay off.

All the good things previous reviewers have said about this film are right on. It's a great story and it's well executed. I suppose the only down side in my book was the ending. This builds up, like most movies of this type, with the detectives finding the killer. When the last scene comes, and it ended, I thought I must have missed something. I was caught off guard and felt as though the movie had just stopped. I also think I need to see it again and watch it sub-titled as opposed to dubbed. The dubbing took away from the emotion of the actors so I didn't get quite the sense of weariness other reviewers spoke of. Maybe I assumed it was running down a certain path and simply missed the clues. Whatever....this is still a major effort.

2334644,5,B0009XRZQK,"Based on a series of serial killings that happened in South Korea in the Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province between 1986 and 1991 has been directed by Bong Joon Ho. I can safely say that this is one of the best movies I have seen this year.
In October 1986 a woman is found murdered, the local detectives quickly descend on the case but are overwhelmed because of the lack of witnesses, evidence and any clues. Hampering their efforts is the shoddy and primitive police work. A city detective is sent from Seoul to assist them and inevitably they have friction over methodology. As the case drags on the detectives become psychologically and physically drained.  The best scenes in the movie are the discovery of the first body, the confrontation between the cops and the mentally retarded man child, the chase and the capture of the suspect who visits the scene of the crime, the murderer stalking the two women on the deserted street and choosing his victim, the climax where the lead detective almost kills the suspect, the very last scene of the movie and the expression on the detective's face.

2334645,3,B0009XRZQK,"""Memories of Murder"" was made in 2003 and is based on true events starting in 1986 in a small Korean town. The film focuses on three detectives and follows their investigation of South Korea's first recorded case of a serial killer. It is an unusual combination of death and laughter while horrible events are remembered. In a small town outside Seoul, over the course of six years, 10 women were raped and murdered in a mile radius. The murders were all women in a wide age range between 71 and 13.

In a small town outside Seoul, over the course of six years, 10 women were raped and murdered in a mile radius.  The murders were all women in a wide age range between 71 and 13.

It has some very engrossing characters which are not hard to believe at all. Considering that the events took place in 1986 odd I must add the film was very well recreated and oh my goodness the woods, the mountains and the rain looked quite gushful. I must compliment all actors on the performance, the director for such a beautifully told tale...

The film has a chase scene which made me stop blinking. It is quite violent and is not meant for children, the ideas and the events can be disturbing but it's a film that really questions the limits. The editing is strong and when the film finally ended, I realized how quickly time went by while watching the film. The suspense is something I will not talk about. You decide.

2334651,4,B0009XRZQK,"""Memories of Murder"" (aka. Salinui Chueok, 2003) is a film based on real events that occurred in a small town in South Korea between 1986 to 1991. The film is about South Korea's first serial killer, when advancements in forensics and DNA evidence hasn't been perfected yet. Director Bong Joon-Ho brings us a dramatic police thriller that portrays the investigation of these brutal rape and murders when all cops could rely upon are their instincts, intuition, street savvy and intimidation. I have seen two very effective and riveting, fact-based South Korean thrillers; ""The Chaser"" and this film; I wonder how come it took me this long to review this film; ""Memories of Murder""?  I feel a little sorry.

In 1986, rural police detectives faced its first case of serial murders when two beautiful women were discovered brutally raped and killed; in very similar method and style. Detective Park Doo-man (Song Kang-Ho, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance) is the man assigned to the case and with his very aggressive partner, Det. Cho-Yung Keo (Rohah Kim) they fail to produce results and doesn't even come close to nailing the killer. However, when a Seoul cop named Seo Tae Yung (Sang Kyung Kim) volunteers to solve the case, things begin to move for the better. Seo's meticulous approach to investigation begins to unearth vital evidence and credible clues as to the identity of the murderer. Unfortunately, poor forensic methodology and the unavailable advance technology threatens to disastrously hamper the case...

Director Bong Joon-Ho approaches the serial killer genre with a very different method. He doesn't rely on shocking images and violent sequences to engage the viewer into the film. Instead, he relies on the details of the actual story, the situation during that time, and the characters that make up most of the film. A wise approach since this case was well-known in Korea during that time, and it has been dubbed by some as their own version of ""Jack the ripper"" since the murderer was never caught up to this day. This film provoked a very strong reaction from the general public and authorities have been pressured to re-open the case, but unfortunately there just wasn't enough evidence and the case was closed more than a decade ago.

Which brings us to the question--since most people know that the killer was never caught, then why make this film because we would know how it would end? Well, not everyone knew the details of the case and the obstacles and issues that hampered the investigation, the cops did have a difficult time putting all the pieces together. During this time, cops went on instinct and very few had the necessary skills and resources to conduct a proper investigation, much less country cops who rely mostly on intimidation and intuition. These cops tend to pick up the wrong suspects and tortures a confession out of them. Some work out, but most doesn't, citizens were angered at this police procedure and the cops' ineptitude. These facts are represented by two country cops, Detectives Do-Man Park and Cho-Yung Keo. You will witness the frustration, the stress they go through, as fleshed out by our characters which generates genuine tension without the aid of eye candy special effects.

While most of the violence is toned down and most of it are hinted at when the bodies are studied, the film does have its share of graphic images. The sequences of the victims bodies, tied down and obviously brutalized looked very realistic. The viewer is witness to the film's autopsies and I thought they were enough to serve up the necessary visceral punch. I thought the director did a wise move in steering away from the actual violence, while the scenes of its aftermath and discussions leave much to the imagination. Those expecting a heavy dose of blood and gore may be a little disappointed but the movie is enthralling enough without grand displays of violence. Being based on a true story, its was clever to keep the violence to a minimum and avoid the over-the-top blood and gore to keep it realistic.

Amid all the investigations, the film does manage to serve up its share of black humor. Song Kang-Ho's character, Park Do-Man may seem lazy, arrogant but he maintains that warm charisma that makes him likable. Detective Park had his share of wise ideas as to the identities of the murderer and his over-the-top approach left me snickering. Sang Kyung Kim's character is also quite well-rounded. His Seoul cop character had that look of finesse and smarts, unfortunately he also experiences his share of frustrations. The screenplay was well-rounded as it maintained a sense of humanity with its serious tone but it never forgot to inject some scenes of black humor.

The film does have a very effective plot twist and asks the viewer exactly what he thought. Director Bong Joon-Ho cleverly practices a sense of restraint in the film and it maintained a touch of simplicity. The cinematography and editing is simple but very effective, the costumes and set designs exemplified this period in the 80's (with the use of typewriters and old cars) that resulted in a well-shot, artistically engaging film. The filmmakers did a commendable job in bringing this harrowing part of Korean history to the big screen with its excellent characterization and emotive script, the film is a can't miss!

Though I will not go into the storyline in depth (that would ruin it for you), I will say the film is striking, there is lots of subtle humor in this movie, though you wouldn't expect it.

Investigation techniques in Korea at that time were primitive at best. Even the police officers in the movie admit this and request help from a Seoul police dept, as well as DNA analysis from the USA. Which at that time was not available in Korea.

This film goes from highs to lows, excitement to disappointment, but it is overall a well produced, little known work of cinema. I liked it, there's a great possibility you could like it too.

The story centers on a couple of crude small town detectives who happily torture suspects into giving confessions -- and who are joined by a more thoughtful detective from Seoul. However, this film doesn't so much provide lessons in forensics or civics than it provides an experience in the agonizing efforts to find and stop a killer.

There's a political message that will manifest only to those intimate with recent Korean history -- I suggest you ignore that. That the characters were constructed to criticize certain political personages kinda ruins it for me.

I'm mostly unfamiliar with the actors -- I recognized only the wonderful Jeon Mi Seon (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HOTLINE/dp/B0018TJ2EM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HOTLINE</a>) as the prostitute -- but they are mostly outstanding.

Don't look for a formula. Don't expect anything cut-and-dried. There's a layer of dark humor but it's mostly down-to-earth with an attempt at honest characterizations. It's deliberately paced and lasts over 2 hours. It's my idea of a great film.",1237161600,3,1204,5.6353591160221
2334654,5,B0009XRZQK,"Don't be put off by the tacky title and silly cover! This may sound pretensious, but I found Memories of Murder to be a wonderfully subtle criticism of the pretensions and tragedy of science -- a lamentation of the failure of Western modernity to deliver the orderly utopia it promised.

In CSI, science almost always reveals the truth, reveals the bad guy. What if the world is not so transparent, however? What if the life is such a complicated mishmash that no amount of methodological digging will reveal the truth?

[spoiler warning]

In Memories of Murder we begin with two old school detectives who have no notion of proper scientific procedure and criminology. When they come accross a nude body shoved under a drain pipe they blame it on the retarded guy in the villiage and coerce him into a confession. Of course he didn't do it and another body shows up making everyone look stupid. The methods of these ""primative"" detectives is beating reality to fit the vision they want.

Eventually a ""true"" detective from Seoul shows up -- a guy who knows criminology, a scientist. He immediately begins finding new clues and showing how inept the other two were. His methodological, scientific approach gets them ever closer to the perpetrator. Eventually they find what seems to be the right guy, but the DNA doesn't match! When the science fails the smart Seoul detective tracks the suspect down and ends up doing exactly what the other detectives did: attempting to beat a confession out of the suspect. When they can't get it there is nothing to do but let the likely criminal free.

The descent from science to brutality expresses perfectly the pain that comes with the realization that science has not brought, and likely will not bring the utopia it promised. Don't get me wrong it bring about a lot of good, but ultimately it fails in its promises. This is, in a way, the same point made in Yellow Earth (Chinese) about communism. It failed it's promise.

I love the final scene. Like many other Korean films it left me with the feeling so prevalent in Asia: the random wonder of the mishmash world and the inevitable failures of our pretensions to control it.",1213142400,2,2170,4.742705570291777

2334656,4,B0009XRZQK,"Memories of Murder (Joon-ho Bong, 2003)

It has now been twenty-one years since the first known serial killer in Korea surfaced. The case remains unsolved to this day. Of course, that never stopped American directors from making serial killer movies (viz. the many movies about the zodiac killer, of which David Fincher's is only the latest), why should it stop the Koreans? Thus we have Joon-ho Bong's Memories of Murder.

Based on the actual events, Memories of Murder covers the case, but is more interested in the police investigating it. The murders are taking place in a rural area, and the lead investigator, Doo-Man Park (The Host's Kang-ho Song), is getting nowhere. The government, frustrated, send in a suave Seoul detective, Tae-Yoon Seo (A Tale of Cinema's Sang-Kyeung Kim) to see if he can break the case. Park and Seo are immediately wary of one another, and their rivalry leads to the case getting nowhere, to the point where Park's commander threatens to crack both their heads. After they grudgingly decide to start working together, the two discover that, perhaps, they have a lot more in common than they first suspected.

Bong (who achieved international fame a few years ago with The Host) obviously has some ideas on who the actual killer is, and he drops some tantalizing clues into the last hour of the movie; how much of what we see is based on the actual police reports and interviews, and how much Bong (who was also one of the screenwriters) slipped in of his own invention is unknown. Not that it probably mattered; the police are such lunkheads in this movie they probably wouldn't have caught the killer even if it turned out to be one of them. The actual investigation is secondary here, however, to the relationships between the characters; the power struggles, the alpha-male grandstanding, perhaps most interestingly Park's growing friendship with one of his first suspects. It all comes together in a surprisingly gripping tale, given how slowly it moves for most of its length. Bong and crew made a fantastic thriller here, one that's a must-see if you're a fan of serial-killer films. Highly recommended. ****",1207008000,3,2148,4.928176795580111

On the other hand, the new methods -- gathering evidence, looking for patterns, profiling the killer -- are slow and unable to produce certainty.  This is a unique kind of serial killer thriller -- unlike almost any I've seen and much more entertaining: in part for the fact that while the threat of the killer and the perverted nature of his crimes are always on the periphery this is not a film that glorifies the killer, American style.  It is about the simple people who work to solve such crimes and the way their efforts affect their lives.

Anyway, 'Salinui chueok' is a great film. This story has a one fundamental

goal to describe how painfully and frustratingly this Hwaseong Serial
 killing investigation progressed for many years.

Perfectly organized plot, superb acting, all the little details make this

 story believable and real. Audiences really will be involved with all the

pains that most of police officers, detectives and Hwaseong people must
 have gone through.

The film has such a huge intensity during the entire time. In the end, you

would really want to find out who that crazy [...] is. You will

understand why the detective has gone mad and tries to shoot one of
 suspects.

Despite of a dark story, director also added many humorous elements in

this film. The humor in this film does some good things. First, it

provides some room for audience to laugh and have a brief break from this

 crazy killings. Interestingly enough, the joke is unusually funny in a

gloomy atmosphere like when a guy is running around to kill some women at

 night. I think the director also loves to use humors in tragic moments.

 So, you will get to laugh out loud once in a while which is a good thing

 when the story so gruesome.

The things I feel sorry for non-Koreans is that they might be lacking some

 important elements to fully enjoy this film, such as understand of

subtlety in language and awareness of Korean history during 80s. But this

film also might provide ya'll motivation to learn something about Korea

Police detectives take unexpected pratfalls in rice fields, and just as unexpectedly, deliver flying kicks to innocent people with little provocation. As the rural police bungle various leads, one fears that the movie might be some horrible hybrid of hard-boiled slapstick. Not to worry. By the time MEMORIES OF MURDER gets to its poetically ambivalent ending, I wanted to applaud. Kudos to Song Kang-Ho (playing Sergeant Hee-bong Koo), who gives a performance that sneaks up on you.

This is a little different.  It is set in a rural town in South Korea.  It is not just about the murder of two women by Korea's first recorded serial killer, but also about the characterization of the detectives and the village people who were all affected by these brutal murders.  The tension never lets up and the actors are excellent specially Song Kang-ho who had to gain a lot of weight to give an accurate portrayal of a rural, gad-about detective.  Watch the DVD extras as well, because they are just as interesting.  The biggest let down for me is the conclusion, not to give away the ending but ""Where is my Hollywood Ending??""  where the good guys catch the bad guy and everyone lives happily ever after.  It took me a few minutes but this movie makes you realize that life is not a Hollywood mystery movie, that sometimes, there are things that you'll never know and that no matter how hard you try, you'll never come to fullfill the mission that you so desperately worked hard for.

The victims are all beautiful young women whose bodies have been found raped and strangled in local fields and ditches.  The initial agents who have been put on the case are two incompetent bunglers - one a dropout from college, the other a dropout from high school - who seem to have gleaned the majority of their investigative techniques from cheesy TV crime dramas.  Enter Seo Tae-yoon, a forensic investigator from Seoul, who wrests control from the locals and brings some big-city know-how to the case.

Given the grim subject matter at hand, it's amazing just how funny so much of this movie turns out to be.  Blessed with a sly sardonic humor and a willingness to make fun of its characters even while evincing a great deal of affection for them, ""Memories of Murder"" plays less like a conventional cop movie and more like a regional comedy filled with rich insights into the subtle truths of human nature.  The relationship between Seo, the investigator from Seoul, and Park Doo-man, the more rational of the two local officers, is intriguing and complex, as we watch them bicker and brawl and engage in petty power struggles, while slowly coming to realize that each has something of value to teach the other if only they can set aside their egos long enough to listen.  Saddled with even-then antiquated technologies, Seo and Park are forced to rely on good old investigative footwork and informed intuition to try and solve the case.

The oddly paired detectives at the center of the story hardly ever win each other's trust and provide enough conflict of their own. Meanwhile, the clues uncovered lead them in circles, falsely arresting one man and then another, and each false arrest generates greater hostility from the public which rightly questions their heavy-handed interrogation methods.

This film succeeds in that it is realistic in its portrayal of how these detectives tried to capture South Korea's first serial killer [as far as we know] and the sloppy and ill-equipped techniques that were used. This film is much better than many far-fetched serial killer films, in that the killer is not a genius, but a cold-blooded killer. And the police are shown as ineffectual and not prepared to handle this type of killer. Highly recommended.",1165104000,4,1146,4.841836734693878
2334670,1,B0009XRZQK,"I watched this film because it got an outstanding review on public radio's Fresh Air.  The critic said it was one of the best mysteries in years.  I would say it was one of the worst I've ever seen.  The portrayal of the police and murder case was unrealistic and unsophisticated.  The clues were simplistic and uninteresting.  Worst of all, it was not entertaining.  I found it hard to sit through this lackluster movie",1160784000,6,420,4.608108108108108
2334671,5,B0009XRZQK,"Director Joon-ho Bong does a wonderful job, in his depiction of the investigation which was based on a true story, surrounding a serial murderer in a pastoral Korean village in 1986.  Without schooling in modern investigative, two rural detectives Park and Cho attempt to use brutality and intuition to apprehend the murderer.  They are joined in the inquest by an inspector from Seoul, Detective Seo who despite a more modern approach is nonetheless also flummoxed in his pursuit.

Although there are many clues provided by the killer and a plethora of suspects, the detectives collaboratively cannot definitely pin the crime on any particular individual.  Their frustration mounts when they receive a response from the U.S. in reference to a DNA test, that clears the prime suspect.

Seventeen years elapse and detective Park, who has retired from the police, at the behest of his wife, and is now a businessman.  His travels bring him into the proximity of the location of the first murder.  The memory of the case lures him back to the site, where he learns from a young schoolgirl that some nondescript person presumably the killer, had also been recently checking out the site.",1157414400,5,1183,5.005102040816326
2334672,5,B0009XRZQK,"This film is quite simply the best I've seen about a serial killer. It puts ""Hannibal""and ""Silence of the Lambs""to shame because both are such obvious fantasies-only ""Henry:Portrait of a Serial Killer""comes close and that film doesn't touch on the investigative angle-this film has some dark humor,but it is overshadowed by the air of menace and the cinematography captures this excellently-particularly in one scene on an overcast windy day-it goes right through you like a chill-this is apparently based on a true case and the ending is anything but ""hollywood""-it is quietly devastating. The inability of the police to make any serious progress despite their hard(and sometimes overzealous) work is very disquieting-the acting and direction are first rate-hollywood better look over its shoulder at Korea where more and more films with great scripts and production values have been originating in recent years.",1153267200,7,913,5.436619718309859
2334673,4,B0009XRZQK,"Memories  of Murder is based on the true story of S. Korea's first reported serial killer. The murders occur in a country town and focus on the year 1986. Detective Park (the wonderful Kang Ho Song) and Detective Cho are assigned to the case, but the investigation is poor, and the detectives inexperienced in such serious crimes. Their idea of solving the case is by beating, torturing and coercing confessions out of any outcast that comes under their radar.
Detective Seo from Seoul is brought onto the case to help with the investigation, but even after a few hopeful leads the case seems to go nowhere.
Memories of Murder shows an interesting twist to the police procedural. The director and writer, Joon Ho Bong, brings something to the genre you don't often see: comedy. For those who are use to seeing Kang Ho Song as a composed and calculated man (such as he was in Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and JSA)will be surprised to find him more as a bumbling, obnoxious country bumpkin detective. He's particularly amusing though, especially when singing off key in a bar.
There are other great touches in the film; like for example after the detectives finish interviewing a suspect about the murder they are shown casually pushing their stalled car down the road. And you won't see anyone do better drop kicks in cinema than the actors do in this film.
I had a few problems with Memories. There was an unnecessary sex scene that seems out of place in the film, and the amputation of a detective's leg is mentioned, and then never brought up again. The movie also has a few cliches, but all of these problems were small as compared to the movie as a whole.
Memories of Murder does not treat the true events lightly, as we see the detectives pour their hearts into finding the serial killer. Unfortunately, so far the effort has been for not.",1149552000,8,1842,4.6503067484662575
2334674,5,B0009XRZQK,"Terrific movie. Old story; cops hunt for killer. Country cops; they investigate by picking the perpetrator and beating a confession out of him. They get a perp, they give a beating, they get a confession.

Then, more murders.

The cops repeat the process.

Eventually, the cops learn to be police. Too late, the murderer has moved on.

They just miss him. The last 90 seconds will chill you stone cold.

Really, really cool movie.",1148688000,8,430,4.756756756756757
2334675,4,B0009XRZQK,I ordered this movie for my son (age 19) and I watched it with him.  We both loved it.,1140652800,4,86,3.526315789473684
2334676,5,B0009XRZQK,"Since a synopsis would be redundant here, I'll confine myself to praise alone.

Each positive comment that precedes this is accurate.  I watched this movie yesterday.  I couldn't take my eyes off it.  Everything taking place onscreen was riveting, from the simple act of walking down a dark lonely road in the rain, to a wild chase by three desperate detectives.  This movie held me in thrall.

As a new viewer of Asian movies, I try to analyze the reason I tend not to be interested in western works any longer.  I finally came to the conclusion that it has to do with the accessibility of the players.  They seem to be people first, actors by choice, and stars, by the public making them so.

In Memories of Murder, I saw this human factor almost too painfully.  By the end of the story, I was in tears.  Even now, the mood prevails.  It's been so long since these crimes took place, and I don't know absolutely that they remain unsolved, but I think it's the case, and I think about that.

The actors have become the people in my mind, and the horrible sense of defeat that becomes palpable eventually, is heartbreaking.  When one relates to the inroads made on the health; mental and physical; of the detectives, who are ultimately portrayed as tireless and completely dedicated to the case, you realize that you've watched something that is historic.  You have seen the probable truth.

The way this movie draws you into it, so that you are walking through dangerous rain, with a warning shout in your throat, points to the brilliance of the director and the players.

It is difficult to say, ""I love this movie"", just as it is hard to say, I love Silence of the Lambs, because love is a peculiar word to use for such fare.

But yes, I love it for the fact that during it, I was in a small village in South Korea in a terrible era of air-raid warnings, military dictatorship, and the hopeless pursuit of a serial killer, and landed back here in this time and place with a thud, only after turning off the DVD player, and going to the kitchen for a glass of water.  I was there, I felt the desperation, and I felt the defeat and the sorrow of the detectives, who were essentially decent enough human beings when all was said and done.

There are not many movies that can time-travel you into their present.  This will do it.

I most seriously recommend that you view the interviews with the director and the stars (all of them are stars of a special kind in my mind) in order to dispel some of the hold the story will have on you.

These are incredibly interesting people, and it's a sheer joy to see them smiling and peaceful.  They're intelligent, educated and articulate.  The younger members of the cast, the less seasoned, are so beautiful in their desire to do it right.

They definitely did it right.  They were wonderful, and they thanked the interviewer.  How lovely that was to see.

I watched the movie using the English subtitles rather than the English dubbing because I wanted the authenticity.  The subtitles were very good.",1140307200,77,3043,4.510054844606947

As director Bong Joon-Ho's first well-known masterwork it seems like a  pivotal landmark in Korean film making and a great starting point for anyone not familiar with his work. To me it's a coin toss, but a lot of people still think of this as his best work of all (think similarly to Pulp Fiction still being thought of by many as Tarantino's best work, being the film that brought him to light).",1521158400,,479,4.443181818181818
