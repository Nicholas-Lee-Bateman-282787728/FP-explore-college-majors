8436821,5,B004NTDEZ2,"Yes the first 20 minutes are a bit out of sync, but its still great to listen to and the whole thing is about 100 minutes.  This is a very unusual band combination with two guitars and no keyboard and I really appreciate the opportunity to see and hear it.  Some of the arrangements and song choices are really a great variation that he can really only have sound this way when there are two guitars.  I've seen Jeff many times and have a number of video discs and I consider this one to be one of the real treasures, performance wise.  (technical warts and all)",1403913600,,562,4.273584905660377
8436822,2,B004NTDEZ2,"As another reviewer said, there is a serious sync issue with the disc.  It only lasts through the first five songs or so, and resolves by 'A Day in the Life', but it pretty much ruins the disc.  A pity, since the sound and video quality are okay - not spectacular - and the performance is pretty good.  This is the only record of Back playing with the Jennifer Batten group, and I wish it were better.",1344297600,,401,4.181818181818182
8436823,2,B004NTDEZ2,"based on other reviews I will not buy this. love the concert so will wait for
  a superior version(hopefully). don't know why it would be so difficult as it was
  recorded for japanese tv.",1327104000,,188,4.4411764705882355
8436824,2,B004NTDEZ2,"Neither video or audio is very good. The DVD I received has a brown cover with a pagoda above the title and a crowd at the bottom There are better versions. The good version begins with the full title sequence. Other versions and this DVD, cut part of the sequence.",1327104000,,265,4.32
8436825,5,B004NTDEZ2,"Jeff Beck is always a great performer live, and he doesn't disappoint on this one. Jennifer Batten is awesome. Never the less, although she didn't join Jeff Back until later, I found myself missing the bassist Tal Wilkenfeld.",1323216000,,225,4.947368421052632
8436826,2,B004NTDEZ2,"I bought this DVD to update a really bad bootleg DVD of the same show.  I have dozens of Jeff Beck concert DVDs.  This is an important documentary of a significant period (Jennifer Batten / Who Else Tour), obviously professionally filmed, but the DVD quality is AWFUL.  A previous reviewer commented on the out-of-synch problems that don't get resolved until 21 minutes into the concert.  In addition, my original bootleg has more complete intro into the first track, has no synch problems, does not have spelling mistakes in the menu, and probably cost less.  The producers of this DVD should be banned from selling at Amazon unless they totally re-edit this product and send replacement DVDs to all who have purchased this DVD.  My recommendation......wait for a better version to appear.  You want this concert, but NOT this DVD.",1313884800,11,832,4.942446043165468
8436827,1,B004NTDEZ2,I've seen a bootleg version originally released only in Japan that was eaiser to watch than this. The people who transfered the original to this should be fired. Don't they view the product for quality issues before they distribute it to the public. Clearly its all about making the quick buck and not concerned about the quality. Obviously they'er not fans of Jeff Beck. You hear the music about a 1/2 to 1 second before you see the image in real time. What a let down for what should have been one of the great Jeff Beck DVD Archives. Does Jeff know about this?  Getting a refund.,1310083200,5,582,4.4392523364485985
8436828,2,B004NTDEZ2,"I agree with the other reviewer - this is horribly out of sync, so bad that I had not actually made it to the spot he mentions where it goes black and then resumes in sync. I did notice skipping around that it seemed more in sync later in the show but this sort of product is inexcusable these days - especially when I purchased what I can only deem a bootleg copy a few years back that not only looks cleaner as far as video but is completely in sync from first to last. Since it was being officially released I felt I'd purchase it legitimately to get the artwork, working menus, etc. I too saw this same tour and the performances are excellent - too bad about the flawed production. I'll be tossing this disc and putting my bootleg copy in the case instead as it's far better",1306195200,5,778,4.193333333333333
8436829,2,B004NTDEZ2,"I just picked this DVD up today at my local record store (yes envy me for having one) Fingerprints. The good news its a pretty stellar show ( I saw this tour myself in LA), the bad news is that this is obviously a very official looking bootleg...which is why its probably NOT billed as a Jeff Beck item. The video quality is sub par by today's standards and even broadcast in '99 standards and my experience with Japan is that their productions even in '99 are technically the worlds best. Now the worst news is its terribly OUT OF synch...for a bunch of the show...for some reason in the middle of the 5th track the DVD stops...goes black and when it resumes its IN synch...about 21 minutes into the DVD.

So....if you have the good taste to be a fan of the great Jeff Beck...enjoy, but be warned to lower your video and audio  expectations.  Am I still glad to have this bootleg...absolutely....so 5 stars for Jeff and zero for the producers of this DVD bring me to 2 and a half.",1305590400,10,981,4.3497267759562845
8436830,5,B004NTDEZ2,"What a delightful surprise discovery today!  Jeff Beck toured behind his ""Who Else!"" release and re-entered the scene with a vengeance after a bit of a hiatus.  Having seen his performance at the Hard Rock Cafe in Las Vegas in April 1999 (The Rolling Stones played the next night at the MGM and rumor had it Jagger & Richards were in the gallery), I happened to be traveling in Tokyo when Jeff came through town, only to miss his performance by one night.  Well, I found a bootleg of the Tokyo BS (broadcast satellite) concert, very similar to the Hard Rock show and it complemented nicely the ""Who Else!""CD, although the image and sound quality was wanting.  Now it appears that this show is about to be released and I'm tickled.  I thought I'd never see a show that could top ""Live at Ronnie Scott's"", but this release may come very close.  I'm not a guitar player, but I've seen most of the greats since 1966 - Hendrix, Clapton, Page, Vaughn, Guy, etc. - and Jeff Beck stands apart, playing so ""tastefully"", it's difficult to measure him - and perhaps it's completely unnecessary.  The band assembled is superb - well-rehearsed - and the set list hits the mark.  For all the histrionics of the uptempo numbers, ""Angel (Footsteps)"" reaches down to a place typically untouched.  You're gonna love it.",1300838400,9,1301,4.646288209606987
