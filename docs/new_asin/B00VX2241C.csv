Shout/Scream Factory continues the onslaught of releasing classic 80s horror films that were found on mom and pop video stores across the country with this double feature. Of the pair one is really good while the other isn't bad but not spectacular. Still they both come out better than some of the things being released today.

CELLAR DWELLER starts us off featuring Jeffrey Combs (THE RE-ANIMATOR) in what amounts to a cameo as comic book artist Colin Childress who in the 50s is creating a horror comic in the mode of TALES FROM THE CRYPT. The thing is hes been using a mysterious book of spells as his inspiration. While reading from the book the creation he comes up with comes to life and upon realizing this he lights his studio and drawings on fire capturing the creature.

Fast forward to the 80s and now the house he once owned is an art colony headed over by Mrs. Briggs (Yvonne DeCarlo). The latest artist to arrive is Whitney Taylor (Deborah Farentino), a comic artist who is a fan of Childress who is well aware of what happened in this building. Mrs. Briggs doesnt feel that comic book art deserves to be included in this group but was forced to take on Whitney due to a scholarship.

Whitney is introduced to her fellow artists. She meets Phillip (Brian Robbins) a painter, Lisa (Miranda Wilson) a performance artist, Norman Mishelski (Vince Edwards) a writer of hard-boiled detective stories and lastly Amanda (Pamela Bellwood), someone Whitney knows only too well. It seems that at the last school she attended Amanda wasn't pleased that Whitneys abilities drew more attention than her own and she sabotaged her tenure there.
With no love lost between these two it is only a matter of time before they collide and with Mrs. Briggs egging her on Amanda is sure to try something.

Whitney enjoys the location but soon decides to venture into the basement, a forbidden area of the house and the location of Childress old studio. Rather than suffer the wrath of Mrs. Briggs she convinced her to allow her to use this area for her studio. Soon she begins drawing comics in the same style as Childress as well as his creation, no doubt inspired by the book Childress attempted to burn in the start of the film. The bodies soon begin to pile up as the creature takes out the artists one at a time. Will Whitney be able to stop him before they all die?

The movie is a fun romp that pays homage to the classic horror comics of the past while using them as the jumping board for the story being presented. If it sounds familiar a similar story was used in the TALES FROM THE CRYPT HBO series but I think this one does it better justice. The artwork used is creepy enough, the plotline believable enough for a horror film and the creature, a practical effect with someone in a costume/make up, works well. This was all before the big leap to CGI and it works here.

The acting is better than most with actors that went on to much bigger things. That pays off in the end with performances that raise the bar on a low budget movie like this. Well shot, well directed and well made, this one is worth watching.

CATACOMBS is the weaker of the two entries here. Its not a terrible movie but it does drag a bit for the most part while offering a decent enough story. At a monastery in the late 1500s a group of monks have captured a man possessed by a demon. Unable to exorcise the demon, they instead chain him to the wall of a room in the catacombs beneath the monastery and seal him in with a blessed seal to keep him inside.

We jump forward to 1988 (when the movie was released) to find Elizabeth Magrino (Laura Schaefer) coming to the monastery for research into the catacombs. Most of the brothers of the abbey have no problem with this save one, Brother Marinus, a by the book monk who feels the presence of a woman does nothing but invite problems. Overruled he is forced to sulk for most of the film.

Also visiting the abbey is Father John Durham (Timothy Van Patten), helping to care for the eldest of the monks and attempting to regain the faith that has dampened for him over the past few years. He questions his beliefs and finds comfort among these monks who have dedicated their lives to God. Before the film ends his convictions will either be renewed or the lack of them will lead to his downfall.

As the movie progresses it offers more story than scares, with each of the monks dealing with their daily chores as well as helping Elizabeth with her research. At the same time strange things begin to happen. Sand begins to fall from various ceilings and noises plague the monastery. Unbeknownst to the monks, the seal has broken from the wall and the bricks are slowly coming loose. The demon is awake and wanting to wreak havoc. Whether it accomplishes this or not is dealt with before the film closes.

Once more made on a shoestring budget the film achieves quality through the performances of several key actors in their roles, recognizable actors by face only but who always turn in great performances. Among those are Ian Abercrombie as the head monk and Vernon Dobtcheff as the one monk who can speak enough languages to handle all situations. Both are faces you will know without knowing where you saw them before.

The story here is deeper than most movies made by Empire Studios, Charles Bands studio at the time and where a number of these Shout/Scream Factory titles are coming from. Having met Band before I can tell you that while his product isn't always stupendous his love of movies runs deep. Having changed from Empire to Full Moon Studios the outflow of product he has released is hard to believe. Both of these movies offer a decent double feature that you can enjoy.",1440547200,,5767,4.533653846153846

They are b films often and for those of us spanning all ages (me being 29) it means the world to have a company that breathes new life into these gems from a lost time of film making. I hipe that the wave will be rising higher to bring back this passionate and practical way of making horror/fantasy/sci fi films the way they used to be! So just to comment on a personal level if you are a fan of charles band or full moon films than definitely support scream factory and your fellow cult cinema enthusiasts by purchasing this one!!
Much love

8711575,4,B00VX2241C,"Scream Factory continues their fun series of bluray double features with this pairing of two 1988 films ""Cellar Dweller"" & ""Catacombs"" from Charles Band's defunct Empire Pictures. Both films were part of a prior 4 film DVD horror marathon collection but in substandard full frame transfers. Fans demanded better transfers and Scream Factory has delivered with this bluray release.

""Cellar Dweller"" is the much better film of the two. Directed by horror special effects legend John Carl Buechler (The Dungeonmaster, Troll, Friday the 13th: Part 7), the film moves along briskly at just under 78 minutes and is a quite entertaining creature feature. The prologue opens with Jeffrey Combs putting the final touches on the latest issue of his demonic comic book ""Cellar Dweller"" when the title creature comes to life. Flash forward to a female comic book artist who desires to resurrect the creature's comic. The creature is summoned and chaos ensues. While the film was obviously made on the cheap, the creature looks great and the acting is actually quite good throughout. It also features quite a doozy of an ending. Fans of 80's horror and creatures should love it.

""Catacombs"" was supposed to also have been released in 1988 but got held in limbo when Empire Pictures went belly up due to money issues. It eventually got released 5 years later as The Curse 4. The plot deals with a haunted monastery and is way too slow for its own good. The movie just plods along with almost nothing of any interest happening for most of its 84 minute running time before delivering a potent ending but by then it's too little too late. Most people will probably watch it once and then forget it's there returning to the highly entertaining Cellar Dweller instead.

Image wise both films look extremely good. Cellar Dwellar opens with a disclaimer that the bluray transfer was made using the last surviving film element which was a film print from MGM's vaults and that some video and audio anomalies might be present. Frankly I was suprised to see that disclaimer as Cellar Dweller looks great in its bluray debut. Detail is quite strong, colors look great and the print was obviously in fine shape. Fans of the film will love how its presented on this release. I was used to seeing it on beat up VHS so watching it in HD widescreen was quite a revalation.

Catacombs looks even better and appears to have been scanned from the original negative and features no issues that I could find.

Audio is presented in 2 channel lossless HD and sounds punchy and clean. Sadly the only extra is a director commentary track on Catacombs with Cellar Dweller getting nothing. That surprises me as John Carl Buechler loves to speak about his work. But I guess we have to take what we can get!

While Catacombs is a bore until the admittedly well done finale, fans of Cellar Dweller should snatch this bluray up immediately. The audio and visual presentation is top notch and while sadly lacking in extras, it still comes recommended to fans of 80's horror in particular.",1437782400,7,3046,4.792380952380952
