8385887,3,B0030I6MM4,"The sound and video quality here is unforgivably bad, and clearly an after thought when this was made. The legendary musicians and their historic performances deserved far better, and and these recordings were obviously left in the hands of someone incompetent and lackadaisical. At any rate, the artists outshine the poorly produced videos here, and it's better than having nothing at all.",1497052800,,390,5.306451612903226

8385891,4,B0030I6MM4,"In November, 2009 Time Life issued a 9 DVD collection of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame + Museum Live moments, which you can also obtain as 9 seperate DVDs. I haven't had a chance to see them all, but I did pick up this particular set.

""Rock and Roll Hall of Fame + Museum Live: Start Me Up"" (110 min.) brings a number of interesting moments from the rich legacy of the induction ceremonies over the years. The DVD starts off with a 1990 performance of the Who (and various all-stars) doing ""Won't Get Fooled Again"". I'm sure they'll do this one at the SuperBowl half-time show in a few weeks, and to think Pete and Roger already look old and tired in 1990 (20 years ago!), pffff. One of my favorite highlights on here is the Byrds' 1991 acceptance speech and performance (with Don Henley and Jackson Browne) of ""Turn! Turn! Turn!"", just watching David Crosby and Roger McGuinn (now 19 years ago) is worth this DVD. Same with the Mamas and the Papas in their 1998 performance of ""California Dreaming"". But the absolute highlight for me on here is Cream's 1993 performance of ""Born Under a Bad Sign"", which just blew me away. Another notable is Fleetwood Mac's 1998 semi-unplugged performance of ""Say You Love Me"" (with the elusive Christine McVie, how she is missed!), and Queen's 2001 acceptance speech (bringing Freddie Mercury's mom on stage, yes!). The only lowlight on here is the Rolling Stones' 1989 acceptance speech (which also appears on the ""Sweet Emotion"" DVD in this series, why the repeat?), and the subsequent all-star ""Start Me Up"" performance, which just doesn't go well.

The DVD comes with some bonus materials, including 7 induction speeches (check out the hilarious and humorous induction speech of John Mellencamp by Billy Joel), and backstage banter of the 2003 and 2004 ceremonies (check out Keith Richards lapping it up with ZZ Top, priceless!). In all, quite a nice collection and I can't wait to check out more volumes from this series.",1263168000,11,1960,4.728070175438597
