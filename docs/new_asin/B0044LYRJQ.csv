8416153,4,B0044LYRJQ,"Sheriff of Cochise won't win any awards and had a limited television run (4 years in both the Sheriff of Cochise and U.S. Marshal titles), but this is a fun contemporary western.  Filmed in B&W in the late 50's.  This is one of the shows my father watched as a teenager.  It has been fun to watch the episodes with him now and try to see how they looked to him all those many years ago.  I love the cars, costuming and the tight story lines. John Bromfield is serviceable as he navigates Cochise County crime and politics. It is clearly not healthy, though, to be one of his Deputies..... (let's say Star Trek Red Shirt)..... Some of the episodes showcase a young Michael Landon or Jack Lord.  These old shows are fiction, but fun film noir.  My only complaint is that the series is not available in its entirety.  I would like to see other entries in this and the U.S. Marshal series.",1379116800,,885,4.359756097560975
