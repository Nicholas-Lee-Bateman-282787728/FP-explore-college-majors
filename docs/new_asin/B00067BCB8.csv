2171120,5,B00067BCB8,"First off, don't get me wrong, I love the Seinfeld show. Although Seinfeld gets my good rating, Curb Your Enthusiasm gets my great rating. To me, the Seinfeld show didn't really get worth not missing, till probably halfway through the series. However, Curb Your Enthusiasm has already reached this point of interest in my mind.

For Seinfeld fans who always wondered what the show would be like a little more uncensored, Curb Your Enthusiasm is definitely worth checking out. For fans of comedy blended brilliantly with irony, buy this series. I have to admit that the third season is really when the show begins to keep you on watch detail. Though the seasons always seem to be taking place around the same time. This season is when it really becomes more satisfying to see each episode back to back.

To fans of both shows, I can't recommend this purchase more. Also, to fans of obviously, long-thought out comedy writing and very clever and sometimes precise comedic timing, this show is worth investing attention. For me, buying this series on dvd was a worthwhile investment. I personally can watch any episode of any season and be more entertained than channel surfing.

Finally, I must admit, that I hope this show goes on as long as Seinfeld, if not, longer. I think first time watchers of this show can like it just as much as myself, and I highly recommend it.",1106092800,6,1370,4.7238493723849375
2171121,5,B00067BCB8,"Larry David doesn't disappoint in the third season of the best comedy on television and one of the Top 10 comedy shows of all time.  Jeff, Susie, Cheryl and Wanda are all back for another season of hilarity.  The ""Crazy-Eyes Killa"" episode is a classic.  No one should be without this gem.",1105488000,2,289,4.519230769230769
2171122,5,B00067BCB8,"I've not yet seen the DVD set, but I can certainly attest to the quality of this fine series.  Once again, HBO has hit the mark with Larry David.  The third season of Curb Your Enthusiasm is full of hilarious episodes -- every one of which is successful in eliciting whole-heared belly laughs.  There's not a one I can think of which fails to well-please the viewer.

This season, the plot revolves around Larry and manager Jeff's investment into a new restaurant.  His business partners are an eclectic bunch, including Tim Kazurinski of SNL fame and Michael York, most recently of Austin Powers (Bazil Expedition) fame.  Larry's offhand remark about Kazurinski's son after a pool party sets the stage for a very memorable episode; and, the season finale is a classic.

If you've never seen Curb Your Enthusiam, you are definitely missing out (think of Seinfeld without the restrictions of network TV).  For newbie's, I would recommend starting with Season 1 and working your way up.  For those existing fans, though, Season 3 is a must-have.",1105228800,4,1043,4.880681818181818
2171123,5,B00067BCB8,wow....larry david is something else...it's a shame so many people have never heard of this show.....if you like seinfeld....you will seriously like this one....especially if you're looking for a little more dark humor.  It's such a good show.....I could watch Larry all day..,1104364800,,276,5.4186046511627906
2171124,4,B00067BCB8,"The show has lost a little momentum each year ... by the fourth season I would say it's not so much as funny a lot of the time.  The third season is still funny, albeit not as funny as the first two.  ""The Terrorist Attack"" was definitely a brilliant episode, raising the Seinfeld-esque question about the etiquette of knowing a terrorist attack is coming - who do you tell?  Your best friend?  Your secretary?  The building janitor?  The ""Crazy-Eyes Killa"" episode was notably great also.  But be ready for this show to slow down.",1101427200,6,531,4.585106382978723

Building on the first two excellent season, Season 3 features many of the same characters, but with greater depth and development. The show is still peaking throughout the season.  Larry, Jeff, Ted Danson, Michael York (playing themselves) and a few others are buying an upscale restaurant, and the season's episodes wraps around that narrative point.  Normally, when you hear, ""more of the same"" about a show it is an insult.  In the case of Curb Your Enthusiasm Season 3, it is the highest compliment.

The language and some of the skits are coarse and sophomoric. One thing I found interesting was the example of the lifestyles of the Hollywood set. The show demonstrates how conformity to common  beliefs are critical to acceptance in the social circles. It may or may not be intentional but seeing the mentality and approach to life is so contrasting to most ways of life outside of the big cities.  There are some very funny skits and if you want some mindless entertainment that gets a bit repetitive, this show is for you. Just don't watch it with kids, extended family members, or people you don't know well because you could be very embarrassed.",1455580800,,790,4.635714285714286

The non-scripted dialogue becomes obvious after a while, particularly with Cheryl Hines.  Also, the conceit of Larry David being so self-unaware is belabored by the fact that the casual acquaintances and total strangers in the show completely overreact to him in a way that would never happen in real life. When you watch episodes back-to-back, this all becomes painfully predictable.",1453507200,,502,5.275

I have been watching a few episodes when I have the time, and am rapidly losing interest in Larry David's obnoxious, self-centered, shallow and ridiculous character.  Sure, it was amusing at first, to see Larry and those around him ""reap the whirlwind"" of their thoughtless actions, but these people--particularly Larry's character--don't seem to learn from experience or to have any moments of clarity about their moral bankruptcy.  It is the same-old same-old from episode to episode.  Even (especially?) Archie Bunker began to grow, after a while.",1447891200,2,637,5.34

There are also lots of famous movie stars making cameo appearances, which is fun.  It all takes place in LA, and the acting is not always good.  But that makes it all seem more true to life.  I watch an episode as often as i can.  It's easy to do, since they are only 1/2 hour and free with Prime.  I lived much of my life in LA and loved it there, and his lifestyle is something I'm familiar with, growing in a family like that.  It's all so real to me.  If you have no experience with that kind of life, you might find the  show annoying.  Some people have that reaction.  I suggest you try one episode and try it for yourself.  It's like seeing my real life family and friends and all the silliness and ""rules"" I was brought up with being made fun of and always misunderstood by poor Larry.  I could go on and on about this show.  He plays the creator and writer for the Seinfeld show, so it has that kind of feeling.  Bad acting, but so much fun.

2173780,5,B00067BCB8,Larry David is a genius and in some ways this show is even funnier than Seinfeld (and I loved Seinfeld). This is the most unusual and strange idea for a series:  a kind of pseudo reality show about his own life: how a very wealthy writer who could disappear to a Caribbean island forever if he wanted instead leads a somewhat normal celebrity life in Los Angeles. He can't seem to keep his foot out of his mouth for five seconds and all of his good intentions seem bent on destroying every relationship he's ever had (or ever will have). Very funny.

I became even more enthusiastic when he began his own series -- and now it's almost certain I qualify as a member of the CYE cult following (if such a thing exists). I have watched all the CYE seasons so often I can voice-over the dialogue. I suppose, upon self-examination, the connection I have made with CYE and Larry David is one of personality flaws and the consequences. Larry's character flaws are my flaws in real life. As I watch his epic failures, and the often calloused judgmental reactions of, let's say, Cheryl's mom and dad, I passionately empathize. I am a professing Christian, but when I watch the overbearing and unforgiving nature of Cheryl's fundamentalist parents, it drives me close to the other side (see Season 2, Episode 9: The Baptism).

2174086,4,B00067BCB8,"This is just one year of the complete seven year set. Year three. I caught bits and pieces of the series when it was on HBO but never put the whole thing together. When you see it that way, you miss things. When you see it this way, you catch those little things that later come out with other little things and the whole thing together makes for a hillarious ending. This way you can sit and see each episode for the whole year and not miss anything like you did when you saw bits and pieces of it each week. Once you get to know Larry and the other characters and see what actually takes place, and how it evolves into a story line, it becomes a really funny, funny show. Now I know why I was addicted to Seinfeld so much. Larry brings the same kind of comedy to ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" as he did to Seinfeld. Very funny stuff, and Amazon has all seven years at a very reasonable price. When you go thru one, you'll want more. But one caution, it's not for small kids. It has some language to it and it has some sexual references in it. I would not show it to smaller children.",1293408000,,1078,4.113744075829384

This is a great series and it is one where you hope the season lasted for than 10 weeks. It reminded me of my craving for Mad Men. Season 3 was ""pretty, prettty good"" as Larry David would say. I have not seen the other complete seasons as this point. I could do without the many F-bombs though by Susie Essman. Curb just cracks me up and this series will do the job.",1289433600,,468,4.043010752688172

I love Larry David because he says what he feels to anyone. And everyone on the show hates him just because he is honest or things are taken the wrong way. If you come into the middle of an episode, you might not get it. So the best thing is to watch it from the beginning. It is more like dry humor. So this show isn't for everyone! But a lot of people like it and his seasons are expensive, you only get 10 episodes. Thats the only downfall. I wish you can get like 20 or something.

After a couple of episodes (if you actually get this deep into it before throwing away the dvd's) you realise that the dialogue actually follows the same structure and speech patterns that Seinfeld does - only this show has no proper actors or comedians to deliver the lines.
It's stiff, slow, tries to hard but keeps on failing, annoying, embarrassing and quite frankly a disaster.
I have no idea who these guys are that gives this 5 stars, but they have to be family of Larry's.
I bought the entire series based on the stupid 5 star reviews and the fact that I too thought that 'Larry Davis, this can only be good' - but I've had to through the dvd's out without even seeing all the episodes.

2174111,5,B00067BCB8,"I think Larry and company are at their best (by an aunt hair mind you)with season III. It's the most complete in terms of what they are trying to do. Larry pushes the boundaries of what is socially acceptable more in this season than any other. The story lines and the fact that the shows are so different from one another, makes this season more special to me than the others.

The restaurant investment is this season's theme captures the conventional life of an otherwise very wealthy and unconvential life style, very well. We are reminded of how wealthy Larry David is in that he invests in a restaurant ""cause it might be fun"". The rich guy with little to occupy his time, but at the same time showing us that he is like the rest of us in many ways. The uber rich can have those little inconsequential concerns that we all have. It's what makes them the same as the rest of humanity and this season brings home that point better than the others. Larry is questioning convention extremely well here.

Above all, Larry David is playing Larry David. This is not a reality show but it is relatively close to Larry's real life I would imagine. It is contrived in that it is a situational comedy that bleeds reality. This is a situational comedy reality show (SRCS). Now, someone just has to coin a name to go with the phrase to describe it since it is truly one of the few if only SRCS shows that exist. The honesty, reality and comedy are what make this show work. Great writing, some actors playing themselves, situations that happen to us all, action and reaction we can all relate to and the finest comedy writing on tv since the Simpsons IMHO.",1165536000,5,1649,4.456953642384106

2174118,5,B00067BCB8,"The third season of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" is the best yet.  I don't know how one goes up from 5 stars, but somehow they managed to do it.  The main characters are the same as from the first two seasons, with Larry David playing himself, Jeff Garlin as Jeff Greene (Larry's agent), and Cheryl Hines as Cheryl David (Larry's wife). Also, as with the first two seasons the dialogue is improvised, and the shows focus on a single character (Larry) as opposed to an ensemble as was the case with ""Seinfeld"".

As with the first two seasons, there are ten episodes in the season of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"".  This season, the season long plot is Larry investing in a restaurant along with several other people (e.g. Ted Danson, Michael York) and the problems they have along he way (e.g. finding and losing chefs, uniforms for the wait staff, a restaurant critic, etc.).  Each episode also has its own plot, which cover a wide variety of subjects such as religion (Christian Science, nativity scenes), Terrorist attacks, mourning, pets, and much more.  All the episodes are very funny, but ""Krazee-Eyez Killa"", ""The Terrorist Attack"", and ""The Grand Opening"" are not to be missed.

This DVD box set includes 2 DVDs, which have all 10 episodes, as well as a couple of excerpts from the ""U.S. Comedy Arts Festival"" in which members of the cast and directors discuss the show and their favorite scenes.",1135641600,13,1391,4.746887966804979
2174119,5,B00067BCB8,"I got CYE based on seeing it in the DVD store, never having seen HBO.  I know Larry David is the co creator and writer on Seinfeld, yet as comedian actor he is totally new to me.

It is fascinating and a little disturbing to see the similarities between Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld.  The gestures, intonation, delivery, humor and even similar facial expressions are a little eerie at times.  Who influenced who?

This third season is brilliant with obvious parallels with both Seinfeld and Fawlty Towers starring John Cleese. Minor situations become major drama, with the main character creating situations which become farcical and then get resolved.  The ruthless self absorption of the LD character, is quite compelling to watch, as he fearlessly goes where other people just wouldn't, and is often oblivious or indifferent to the destruction he causes.  You just got to admire someone who relentlessly does not care what other people think.

I was particularly appalled by the firing of the chef, after hiring him for being bald, and then firing him for wearing a toupee.

Refusing to thank a friend's wife for buying dinner, because her husband put down the card, and he was the bread winner, as it was his money not their money that was paying for the meal.

Shamelessly using the death of his mother to get sympathy sex from Cheryl.

Having Cheryl bake cookies filled with Benadryl so that Richard Lewis' new Christian girlfriend who refused to take medication would eat them and recover quickly from her peanut allergy reaction which LD triggered.  The beauty of it would be she would think her recovery was due to prayer.

Asking a waiter for the tip back because he thought he had tipped him twice.

Giving his friend a yoga mantra, Ja Ya then asking him to stop using it.  Friend discovers yoga mantra means f--- me!

The episode where he hires the chef with Tourette's syndrome, is classic in the way of Seinfeld.

I think my favorite episode if I had to choose is the Corpse Sniffing Dog.

Cheryl the wife is priceless as a study in patience 'Loving you is my job Larry.'

I could go on.  LD is truly appalling, yet I love the show, and have also ordered season 2.  The series does contain some strong language, compared to network offerings.  Update: Having now seen season 2 as well, I consider season 3 is consistently better, although I have to say season 2 has a couple of really outstanding episodes.  I particularly liked the one with Thor the Wrestler.  I recommend you get season 3 first.

All the episodes on season 3 are very good. There is a stop and greet interview with most of the cast. It is interesting to note that there is little scripted dialogue, yet the stories are very well structured, and the situations are extremely well set up, and the actors just go, and they have different cameras focused in on each actor.  It is unconventional, yet works amazingly well.",1133481600,9,2902,4.6857707509881426

2174128,5,B00067BCB8,"CYE has matured to move away from the single, self-enclosed episode format to offer an overarching storyline. The first episode kicks off the main theme of Larry investing in a restaurant with celebrities Ted Danson and Michael York. The restaurant story wonderfully ties together the 10 miniplots, each dealing with several different themes. Season 3 covers the threat of a terrorist attack, piatas, tipping, a corpse-sniffing dog, affinity between bald men, house tours, pubic hairs, pet allergies, accusations of stalking, marital jealousy, gossip, Bartlett pears and more. Is it okay to ask a mourning widow where her late husband bought the shirt he's wearing in a photo? Can you throw trash in someone else's trash can? Can you turn down a house tour? Is it okay to congratulate someone on his kid's big penis? Nothing is holy, nothing off limits, especially not religion. David tackles Christian Science's aversion to medicine, Jews with tattoos, and spreads his own brand of Christmas cheer when he ruins a manger scene by eating Baby Jesus.

Of all three seasons so far, Season 3 is not only the most quotable, it's also the most uplifting. Larry still gets into heaps of trouble and you'll be cringing at the masterful derailments and degeneration into total chaos, but in the end, Larry actually emerges with his head held high. You'll start to understand the man. You'll know that he doesn't hate people. He just hates the ones he knows.",1116028800,7,1449,4.987603305785124
2174129,5,B00067BCB8,"I love this comedy.  Larry David is to the sitcom what Joseph Heller is to the novel.  The cast and crew are top notch.  The writing is pure genius.

Certain lines have to be delivered by the actors, but much of the show is improvised.  Remember when Tim Conway would almost cause Harvey Korman to go out of character because he was laughing so hard he couldn't deliver his lines?  Curb Your Enthusiasm is funny for the same reason.  There are times I can tell when Larry David and his cohorts are so funny they can't keep from laughing at each other when they are doing the show.  Despite the absurdity of the exaggerated plots, the thoughts are real and the social collisions are familiar.

My favorite scene:  The restaurant will be opening soon.  One of the workers is checking the water supply to the bar.  Larry David says, ""Watcha doing?""  Stoned-faced guy says ""Little plumbing.""  Larry:  ""Little plumbing, huh?  Got to PLUMB.  Plumb the depths.  The depths of HELL......""  He's joking around, but the worker doesn't react at all.  Nothing.  I laughed so hard I fell off my couch.  I am sure those three lines were totally improvised.",1115424000,4,1142,4.633165829145729
2174130,5,B00067BCB8,"In this season of CYE...Larry David has fully evolved from being a somewhat whining, but ultimately helpless victim of mishaps (a character who draws sympathy, if you will) into a full-fledged irritant.  He's oblivious of the feelings of others (see the 1st episode, ""Chet's Shirt"", in which he is incapable of expressing any sympathy towards a recent widow) and he's whinier and more self-centered than ever.  Many of his troubles now stem from his endless quest to either ""get his way"" or ""not be bothered.""  He has now become a ROYAL pain of the first rank.

But the show, thank goodness, is just as funny as ever.  Ted Danson is now appearing regularly, and he's fun playing himself.  The wife of Larry's agent is back on the scene, and she's always a riot...the one person who really takes no guff from Larry.  The situations are richer and more convoluted than ever, and virtually no plot points are left dangling after any given episode...they all tend to tie up neatly in the last five seconds of the episode.  (A throwaway bit early on shows Larry strolling down his neighborhood and tossing an apple core into the garbage can of a neighbor...said neighbor is upset and words ensue.  The bit is dropped until the last, hilarious scene, when we've completely forgotten it.)  I think the writing is tauter and has a nastier edge than ever...which is what I like.  This isn't a ""friendly"" show...but it sure is funny!  And that's all I need from a comedy.  Well-acted, well-written, original in its conception and with a hummable score.

I didn't think they were bad, just not funny. (and I say this as someone who liked Seinfeld because its characters were essentially self-centered and rather unappealing...much like Larry David in this series.)

Thinking that maybe I just hadn't seen enough of Curb to get a true picture of it, I got the third season.  Well, I did laugh a few times. But watching more episodes made me aware of what makes me uncomfortable about the series:

- being a workingperson yutz in Upper West Side New York, interacting with waitresses and bodega owners and George Steinbrenner, is funny. Being a yutz in Beverly Hills with more money than God, whining and being obnoxious and always needing to be the contrarian center of attention, isn't funny. It makes me wonder why anyone wants to be around Larry David, the character -- unless the other characters are either sucking up to his wealth or are yutzes themselves.

-but we never get to learn if the other characters are yutzes because the focus is squarely on Larry David. Whether it's Larry's wife or manager, or the many 'guests,' none of them are given much room to do anything besides being passive foils displaying varying degrees of weariness. (The character of Larry's wife is particularly given to not much more than shrugging and eye-rolling.)

The bottom line is, I just don't get it. And with the third season episodes, I'm giving up on trying.",1110585600,11,1558,4.7518518518518515

Finding a chef for the new place means Larry goes through a laundry list of reason to reject and accept new people.  From a chef wearing toupees to a Chef with  Tourettes Syndrome Larry and company cannot catch a break.

The story and acting are all top form.  The Nanny, The Benadryl Brownie, and Crazy Eyez Killah are the highlights of season three.  There are some great cameos from Martin Scorsese, Martin Short, and Alanis Morissette.  Overall season three is an excellent edition to the Curb Your Enthusiasm collection.  Laugh as Larry gets a kid drunk, digs up his dead mother, and spikes some brownies.  There is no other show on TV like it and hopefully Larry David's brand of humor continues to find an outlet.

For the first time, a central theme is loosely followed from the beginning of the season to the end, where Larry along with several celebrity (and non-celebrity) business partners decide to invest in a restaurant.

Season Three is as fresh and enjoyable as the first two seasons, and includes several classic moments:  Larry inadvertently eating the nativity cookies his wife and inlaws bake in celebration of Christmas, and, classically, his failed attempt to redeem himself by hiring live performers to recreate the nativity scene on his front lawn; Larry's interaction with a rapper named Krazee-Eyez Killa, in which two very different worlds collide; the Looney Tunes nanny who ends up giving a purpose to sponge cake; and on and on.

Since I don't get HBO, I proceeded to rent the first two seasons on DVD a couple of months ago. Let's just say I had Season 3 pre ordered ASAP. This truly is deserving of the many claims it has received as one of the funniest shows on television. It certainly is the funniest thing I have seen in recent memory.

 CYE Season 3 keeps up the hilarity of the previous seasons, and makes the series seem a bit more seamless, although each episode can still be plenty enjoyed as a stand alone. By now, if you are considering purchasing this set, you must have already seen the first two seasons (and if not, what are you waiting for? Go!), and this season is in the same vein as the prior two.

However, this show is not for everyone and the faint of heart. Yes there are awkward situations and sexual references, yes there is vulgarity, and if that is all you can see (or if you can't handle it), then this show is certainly not for you. If you are a person who is easily offended by some dirty humor, you'll want to stay far, far away from Curb. But there is genuine comic genius in just about every episode of this show, and if you can deal with the wanton attitude and coarse nature of the show, then you're in for a real treat. Once again, if you've already seen the first two seasons already, you'll know what you're in for.

  If Seinfeld was a show about nothing, CYE is a show about nothing that quickly turns into something. In case you haven't already seen the show, seemingly trivial and minor incidents that occur to Larry David early on always become magnified and return to play a role of huge consequence later in the episode. If you think you're having a bad day, just wait until you see some of the exploits of Larry David. The man must have the worst luck around! If you appreciate the style of humor the show has, you will surely burst out laughing at least once every episode. Larry David may come off as a direspectful, ignorant, snob to some, but I'm sure most people can relate to him at least in some small degree. Highly Reccomended.

Along the way he endorses a nutty nanny, screws up an Alanis Morissette concert, becomes a grave robber among other mishaps. The ""Krazee-Eyez Killa"" episode is an instant classic. There's an OK hour of extras with the Comedy Arts Festival.
