2711432,2,B000LP5D5Q,"I got the Rifftrax version of the movie.  I knew it would be interesting to see, and it is, but I would say this is impossible to watch more than once - with or without the Rifftrax commentary.  The movie is just plain bad.  Nothing happens except a lot of songs, some Stooge routines you've already seen before, a kid doing a bad sound effect routine, and one of the weakest plots in all history.  Seriously.  It starts out with a lady looking for a job to be able to pay her rent, and she works for one night club that's competing with another night club, and I think the night clubs might be owned by the same family, with the younger son trying to show he can stand on his own two feet.  Well that's all well and good, but then you get to a song.  Okay.  Then a Stooge routine, then another song, then a small attempt at looking like there's a plot still going on, then another song, then another song, then a Stooge routine, then another song, and then another small jab at continuing the plot, and the process repeats.  Then a new character is introduced 20 minutes until the end.  Then two more songs, and it's over.  I never figured out what happened.  Swing Parade is what its name implies.  A constant parade of songs from the swing era, and little else.  Dull, dull, dull.  You might as well just buy a record from the 40's, because this is no better.  It's actually quite worse with the meaningless skits that try to mimic plot development.  No amount of commentary can help this movie.  Watch it once if you're curious, but no more than that.  Thank goodness for Rifftrax shorts.",1270857600,,1592,4.35374149659864
2711433,4,B000LP5D5Q,"This is promoted as a possible purchase for Three Stooges fans, and it is a legitimate one, but anyone who thinks this is actually a Three Stooges movie will be sorely disappointed. They are supporting players, not the stars. They do, nevertheless, appear in quite a few scenes and are at the height of their fame at this stage with well-developed routines.

As other reviews have made clear, this is primarily a vehicle for Gale Storm, several years before her television stardom on My Little Margie. There is a charming My Little Margie episode among the extras, the others of which are numerous but ultimately disappointing (what possible relevance could a colourised fragment  from a contemporary Abbott & Costello movie have?). The ""commentary"" is particularly disappointing, adding no value at all. The commentator appears to be watching the movie for the first time, knowing fewer background facts than the average viewer might. He's also not as witty as he evidently thinks he is.

The colourisation is also a little disappointing, frequently seeming overwhelmed by the original dark tones. An earlier reviewer who said this version is simply a transfer from an older videotaped version might have provided the key, the colourisation technology at that earlier time being more primitive than that available now. That said, it is a novelty to see a B movie of this period in colour at all, and I for one prefer it to the original black and white, which is also on this disc, looking quite good.

Ultimately, the value of this disc has to be judged on the value of the Swing Parade movie alone. I think it is quite good as an example of its genre, and of course, for Stooges completists, although the Stooges are minor players, it is a must.",1255996800,,1747,4.832775919732441

The 3 Stooges have supporting comedic roles as waiters. It's obvious here that Curly was in failing health.

Highlights of this so-so musical are Louis Jordan and his Tympany Five's performance of their jump hits, ""Caldonia"" and ""Don't Worry About the Mule."" Former Boswell Sister Connee gives a powerful rendition of ""Stormy Weather"" and Gale Storm dances and sings ""Oh Brother."" She also does ""On the Sunny Side of the Street."" Phil Regan is heard and Will Osborne's band has a couple of numbers, as well. Windy Cook does vocal impressions of everything from a soda bottle to a saw.

SYNOPSIS--
To get his son to enter the family business, wealthy Daniel Warren Sr. sends Carol Lawrence with papers that will close Danny's nightclub. When Carol auditions and is hired as a singer the document never gets delivered. Then the father himself arrives to finish off Jr.'s nearly bankrupt club.

2711435,5,B000LP5D5Q,"Who needs that bum Shemp anyway?  Swing Parade of 1946 is a full-feature musical comedy starring the terrific threesome as they bungle and bumble their way through another one of their harebrained schemes; this time unsuccesfully attempting work as nightclub waiters (which is the segue for the film's numerous musical performances).

Fans of the Stooges will relish the opportunity to see not just some of their rarer later work, but also Curly's last hurrah as a Stooge.  By this time, everyone's favorite goofball had succumbed to illness, and it certainly shows on-screen, in his physicality, demeanor and lack of energy.  It probably takes a more careful eye to notice the difference between his work in Swing Parade as compared to earlier shorts, and perhaps you'll relish the challenge as much as I.

Beyond the boys' performances, the highlight of this DVD is the colorization process applied by Legend Films.  Growing up, I was only familiar with the Stooges through their extant black and white tapes.  The oppressive gray monotone served as a barrier between a bygone era and my young self.  I found that the colorization process (and it's quite good) allowed me to identify with the Stooges on a more human level than before.  Now I see them as regular, blue-collar everymen, when before they were merely objects of amusement.

I'm sure that some you might object to the alteration of such nostalgic memories, and you're certainly right to feel that way.  And Legend, thinking of us, has thoughtfully included a touched-up (though un-altered) black and white version of the movie on the same disc as the newly colorized version.  So before you run off in disgust, just remember that at least this DVD gives you the option of viewing it either way.

Also deserving a mention is the ""RiffTrax"" commentary provided by Michael Nelson of Mystery Science Theater 3000.  As a fan of the show, this was a truly special treat.  This particular commentary is a special option that allows you to hear Nelson's hilarious mocking sarcasm during the film.  Though typically reserved for making fun of bad science fiction movies, trust me when I say that it makes absolutely any film that much funnier.

Also included in this DVD are a few notable shorts, making Swing Parade a true must-purchase for the Stooge fan (look at how much you get!).",1227657600,2,2341,4.916030534351145
2711436,2,B000LP5D5Q,"Most people today would want to see this for two reasons. 1) The Three Stooges (the classic lineup featuring Jerome ""Curly"" Howard) and 2) The performaces by the clown princes of jazz Louis Jordan and the Tympani Five.

Overall, it's a really weak and stupid backstage tale featuring Gale Strom (from the almost forgotten ""My Little Margie""). Sadly, the beloved Stooges don't really have that much to do. The slapping slapstick is quite bland for those accustomed to classic Stoogery and Curly is clearly sick in this one (his career-ending stroke was not long afterwards). Don't bother folks, stick with the short subjects.

The one thing that peps the film up is the appearance(s) of the super-lunatic madman surpreme and crown prince of jazz comedy-Louis Jordan and the Tymapny 5. They actually start the film off with an enjoyable version of ""Don't Worry About The Mule"" and later, they set the screen on fire with ""Caldonia."" They start off by playing flourescent instruments in the dark and at the end of the tune, LJ puts down his sax and does a rollicking, high stepping dance with his chorus girls.

This is the only thing that is really worth seeing in this film and that's why it gets 2 stars instead of one from me. Too bad Jordan and the Stooges don't interact in this movie. Also, stay away from the really stupid commentary track that is filled with grossly unfunny gags and no information about the film whatsoever. Unless you're a Louis Jordan or Stooge completist, avoid at all costs.",1219276800,2,1502,4.769230769230769
2711437,4,B000LP5D5Q,"My main comaplaint is what the reviewer was saying below about the color inconsistances,there are some odd places where you see the color of the clothing change ,for example the three stooges will be wearing pure white clothing (almost like they forgot to color in the black and white) then a minute later they are wearing grey,then back to white again,also sometimes the skin tones in some places look odd kind of like green or maby even an orange color,it's almost like they gave it to different people to color different sections,now as the movie goes on the color get's better,in fact the whole restaurant scene with the dancers and the ""Caldonia"" songs was beautifuly done,I give it 4 stars because I think the movie is an underated gem,where else can you get the three stooges with curly in a full lengnth film in print,also the song ""Caldonia"" is the best thing on the whole thing,it shows the change between swing,jazz and what later became rock n roll,it's obvious these guys influenced Little Richard,also this is one of the few three stooges movies where they worked outside of the studio and the major censors of the time so keep you eyes out for some mild sexual innuindo in a couple parts,nothing to overt though,but it's there...",1181865600,7,1244,4.763888888888889
2711438,2,B000LP5D5Q,"In the 1980s, the colorization companies all shot themselves and the process in the foot with the poorly done movies they inflicted on the public. The term ""colorization"" became hated because of this sloppy product and because the process threatened to keep the black-and-white originals off the market.

With their first 3 Stooges DVD (titled simply ""The Three Stooges in Color"") Legend Films showed us that they are not stuck in the 80s. THAT DVD was gorgeous, with lively color well applied throughout each short film.

""Swing Parade"" however, is an unfortunate throwback to the previous generation. The colors applied here are very unrealistic and muted. At best, it looks like a hand-tinted photo from around 1912. At worst, it looks ridiculous, with a green-skinned man standing next to a normal looking woman. The colorizers were sloppy as well, with such glaring errors as the central character's coat changing colors during the course of the film.

Of course, the saving grace is that Legend Films includes the original black-and-white version of the film on the same disc. It's just a shame that after showing us what they can do, they got sloppy. The film has not been cleaned up, either; there are dirt and scratches in many scenes.

But I'm wondering if the biggest mistake of all wasn't bringing this film to DVD at all. It's a very weak movie. The attempt at a plot is better not thought about. The Stooges get very little chance to do much of anything. The usually wonderful Connee Boswell does not get to swing at all, and her screen presence is like that of a mannequin. Far and away the best bit in the movie is a great rendition of ""Caldonia"" by Louis Jordan and His Tympany Five. But three minutes can't save the rest of the movie.",1176940800,3,1752,4.7344262295081965
2711439,4,B000LP5D5Q,"Low-budget Monogram Pictures usually made a couple of higher-bracket ""specials"" every year with the studio's leading star, Gale Storm. SWING PARADE (originally released as SWING PARADE OF 1946} is Monogram's biggie for '46, with The Three Stooges in featured roles. It's an above-average Monogram production with good direction by Phil Karlson, and fans of '40s movies should enjoy it.

Gale Storm is an aspiring singer mistaken for a process server at Phil Regan's new nightclub. Regan and the Stooges are determined to open the club successfully, while the stern Russell Hicks is just as determined to close it. The Stooges are in fine form, with the reliable Ed Brophy as their foil in extended versions of their ""plumbers"" and ""waiters"" routines. (Moe didn't dye his hair for this one, so you'll notice the salt-and-pepper in the haircut.) Considering that Curly was in failing health at the time, his work here is especially good. The other guest artists are Louis Jordan and his Tympany Five, who do two jump numbers (""Don't Worry 'Bout that Mule"" is the standout), singer Connee Boswell, and sound-effects mimic Windy Cook.

Former video releases have left something to be desired: the Allied Artists edition uses a beautiful print but an inferior video transfer so the image is sometimes unsteady; the Goodtimes version (under the title ""Swing Parade"") has a better transfer but a slightly lesser print and a superimposed watermark in the lower-right corner.

This new Legend Films edition is a definite improvement over past video versions. The source print is identical to the Goodtimes version but there is no watermark, and the colorization is very well done (some of the Gale Storm close-ups are particularly pretty). This picture is almost never shown on television, so most Stooge fans probably haven't seen it. Confirmed Stooge fans will enjoy the team's antics, but may be impatient with the stretches of story between the trio's appearances.",1174262400,23,1959,5.154088050314465
2711480,5,B000LP5D5Q,"A Stooges fan or not, you are sure to love this film which is a rare one of the Stooges. I originally bought this film for my dad who is a huge Three Stooges fan. We both just loved it and the colorization was incredible. I later watched the black and white version, which also was perfectly restored-that is the Golden Age of Hollywood version.

I highly reccomend it to both Stooges fans and MSTies/Rifftrax Fans alike. It may be a bit different than the usual fair for Rifftrax but thats what makes it so great, like their riff of Casablanca or The Wizard of Oz (Recent - not the fake pirated one). It brings back that MST3K vibe of riffing on old movies people might not of seen otherwise (okay maybe not the Wizard of Oz but I would've never seen Casablanca had it not been for the rifftrax version and not only is that a great riff its an awesome classic movie. Swing Parade may not be on Casablanca level by ANY means or Wizard of Oz but its certainly another movie I was introduced to by the rifftrax crew from days of old - I believe, correct me if Im wrong - this was Colorized by Legend FIlms aswell.

2711487,4,B000LP5D5Q,"""Swing Parade of 1946"" is a flimsy musical comedy from the Z-grade Monogram Pictures.  However, while not great, it IS watchable and is distinguished by one of the more protracted appearances of the ""classic"" Three Stooges (Curly, Larry, & Moe) in a feature length film.

Sadly, it was filmed and released the year that Curly Howard's stroke negatively marked his onscreen antics.  While his performance is not as sluggish as it would be in some of the Stooges shorts that year, his voice is still a hoarse croak and his reactions are much slower that in his healthier days.  But, he still manages to keep up and, overall, the Stooges appearance in this movie is a success.  And, they ARE in the picture quite a lot.

Even better are the two musical numbers by Louis Jordan, who really cooks!  They almost make it worth a purchase all by themselves!",1336694400,,849,4.657718120805369

The absolute treat of Louis Jordans ""dont you worry bout that mule"" will get your feet and or fingers tapping or snapping for sure. Moe , Larry and Curly are in CLASSIC form here much like in the short subjects we all came to love. Gale Storm is adorable and the production is definitely on the high end for a ""B"" film.",1322784000,,520,4.262626262626263
2711489,4,B000LP5D5Q,"Interesting was the range of reviews for this title, with low ratings for the Three Stooges performance, and high ratings for the very same; and reasons to buy ranged for nearly each individual star in the film (Gale Storm, Stooges, Connee Boswell, and Louis Jordan).  Some found the quality great; others found it poor.  In short, it's nearly impossible to gauge what it is to like or dislike about the film based on the reviews to date.

As of this writing, Amazon has this title priced at $8.99, and that's really the right price.  I only watched the colorized version; I will assume that the B&W version is adequate.  Either way, you get both on one DVD.  One of the other treats I found on the DVD is the unusual but cute selection of bonus material: almost all somehow related to the main stars of the film (Gale Storm and the Stooges), you get a TV episode, a short cartoon, a snippet of an Abbott and Costello film with Shemp and Joe Besser (both Stooges) and a two reeler that felt kind of like a Stooge short but with other characters.  None of which would be worth much in itself, but better than nothing.

As for the movie itself, I would give it 3 of 5 stars, as I think the Stooges are funny here (Curly's good despite his declining health) and the Louis Jordan numbers are great.  These were my reasons for wanting the title.  The rest of the film was, in my opinion, typical Hollywood musical fluff.  Not BAD, but not of any real value either.  Songs were good, production value okay... still, I just wish the Curly Stooges had one full-length feature to their name.

The presence of the ""Stooges"" may be the obvious draw for this one--they definitely provide most of the humor; although Ed Brophy in a Healy type role is great himself. A lot of attractive women running around too--if you're into that sort of thing.

The story--what there is of it--is easy enough to understand. Process servers, a father who doesn't want his son in the entertainment business, some jilted landlords, and a pretty good looking movie in spite of it's budget limitations. Usually these B or C grade turkeys look just like that--but, if you didn't know any better--this would look like the same sort of movie Columbia or Universal could have cranked out.

8162775,2,B000LP5D5Q,"Even if you are a life long mst3k fan like me, I think you will most likely find this riff boring and disappointing.

its just mike riffing... rifftrax already has the disadvantage of not having the silhouettes like mst3k, which in my opinion creates a disconnect between the riffers and the movie and the viewer. Having only one riffer makes it even more awkward and just plain not funny.",1407974400,,389,4.63768115942029

8162778,4,B000LP5D5Q,"This Legend Films DVD has been touted as being SWING PARADE OF 1946's best quality home video release.  In terms of visual quality, the Legend Films print is, in my opinion, a couple of notches above what one might expect from Public Domain Prints, which is the manner that SWING PARADE OF 1946 otherwise appears on Home Video issues.  With that said, lines and scratches do often appear, and I find the imaging just a little less sharp than I would like it to be.  With the few Legend Films DVDs that I own, I've noticed a similar pattern in terms of visual quality. Generally very good, but not quite top notch.  With that said, I think it is also important to keep in mind that with Monogram Pictures being a ""B"" Movie Studio, they didn't use the best quality Film Stock to begin with.  Thus the lines and scratches are understandable, though it is my opinion that an HD Transfer could have helped with the sharpness.

The audio quality, while not anything to write home about, is in my opinion passable, particularly for a ""B"" Film of this Vintage.

In my opinion, I would unfortunately be remiss if I didn't make mention of the fact that I've experienced some inconsistent playback issues with two different copies of this particular DVD Title.  This has to do with such things as momentary image freeze, and slight speedup at the beginning of one scene.  Sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn't.  It could be that I just got unlucky, but I'm also thinking that there might be some quality control issues regarding the discs themselves.  And yes, I did check for scratches, smudges and dust particles on both DVD's; there weren't any!

As far as the Film itself, I haven't much to add beyond what has been covered by other reviews, with a few exceptions.  First off, I was delightfully surprised by the amount of Screen time the Three Stooges enjoy here, though I find their slapstick just a bit toned down in this Feature.  I also couldn't help but draw parallels between Connee Boswell's closing number for this and Frank Sinatra's epic finish in TILL THE CLOUDS ROLL BY, which was released to Theaters about ten months later.  It is my speculative thought that the SWING PARADE OF 1946 closing may have served as a bit of inspiration for MGM, who of course had to top it, which they did!

Oh, and be sure to watch out for young Actor Windy Cook's (?) amazing sound effects!  This guy was truly the Michael Winslow of his day, which makes it all the sadder that virtually nothing is known about him (Other than having been born Winfield S. Cook in Philadelphia PA on October 31, 1927.), and this was his only known Film appearance!",1397001600,,2641,4.585106382978723
