1005853,4,6305261431,"As has been said, Hong Kong 1941 deals with friendship against the backdrop of the Japanese invasion of that year. The way this film examines the strength of the friendship between Chow, Man and Yip is excellent and  the tension created by the impending danger of the Japanese is well  realised. This would have to rank as one of Chow Yun-Fat's strongest  performances and Alex Man has never been better. With Ceilia Yip also  putting in a quality performance, this is an all-round classic. It reminded  me of some of Chang Cheh's best films and for anyone who appreciates Hong  Kong cinema, that should be praise enough.",944611200,21,621,4.757009345794392
1005854,5,6305261431,"As the title indicates, this movie begins in Hong Kong in 1941--not a great place to be at that time, because the Japanese Army is about to invade the city. Chow Yun Fat plays an out-of-work actor who befriends a  coolie (played by Yip Man,) and the coolie's girlfriend. The three of them  struggle to survive and to maintain their dignity as Chinese under the  Japanese occupation. Chow Yun Fat and Yip Man give great performances as  two men who become fast friends, but whose friendship is complicated by the  fact that both are falling in love with the same woman--who also dearly  loves both of them. Everyone in this film is good, but Chow Yun Fat is  great in his range of expression. There is an excellent fight scene between  the protagonists and the Japanese occupying general. The movie is  fast-paced and realistic, patriotic without being sentimental. The movie  never drags and has great characterization and plot. It will appeal not  only to fans of Chow Yun Fat, but anyone who likes war movies, adventure  movies, or movies about romance or friendship. A must-see!",927936000,16,1081,4.783783783783784

7886976,1,6305261431,"Not worth one star! The whole movie lacks of interest. Mainly the beginning half. It tries to be funny stupid and the acting is awfully cheap. Slow, pointless and childish plot for most of it. Only gets a bit better when the Japanese show up, but still the acting is so third world country and amateur that makes me sick. A complete waste of my time and money. Don't waste yours. It really sucks, and I love foreign movies based on this period of history, but this one is far from the quality and interest of others. Top pure crap. Avoid like the pestilence!",1410048000,,558,4.375
7886977,5,6305261431,"As an Old China Hand I found this movie to be nothing but EXCELLENT. Cecilia Yip and Chow Yun Fat were, as usual, outstanding.....

A most enjoyable Cantonese love story.",1307232000,,170,4.666666666666667
7886978,5,6305261431,"One of Chow's best movie in his earlier career. He was young, handsome,gave us a powerful performance. He got the best actor awards of Asia and Taiwan's golden horse film competition by this movie. Full of action, love ,friendship and courage. Sometimes English subtitle does not get the exact meaning of the original Cantonese. Highly recommended for fans of Chow Yun-fat.",1234396800,,373,5.131147540983607

Directed by Po-Chih Leong (""Out of Reach"").  The movie is written by Koon-Chung Chan (""Kiss Me Goodbye"").

Plot: The movies opens before the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, with the British attempting to send the women to safety in Australia.  Food is rationed, and a minor riot occurs when the rice warehouse owner refuses to pay his workers. Then the Japanese invade and occupy Hong Kong. Before and during the occupation, three friends struggle to survive, with each attempting a different method of survival (Kong, Fai, and Anna).  At the beginning of the movie Fai is living with his aunt and uncle (and attempts to stow-away on a boat to Australia), while Kong works for the rice people, and Anna wanders around screaming (apparently she has some genetic disorder, and is the daughter of a rich man that owns the rice warehouse and who is attempting to marry off his daughter (arranged marriage) to his new business partner's son (even though she and Kong have some kind of relationship).  The three friends decide to try to leave for Australia, but the day they attempt to leave, the Japanese attack.  Fai makes it onto a boat, but the other two do not.  He decides that he cannot leave without them.

Review: The movie opens with a woman remembering her darkest days, which occurred in 1941 in Hong Kong.  The woman occasionally offers some narration during the movie.  A strange movie that opens slowly and, for the most part, continues to be slow.  The movie picks up, a little, when the Japanese invasion starts and the Hong Kong citizens riot and loot.

Interesting movie about a strange time in Hong Kong history.  The inhabitants either collaborate (and some do it to help others), attempt to hide in the shadows, or actively work against the occupation.  Some of the collaborators really take advantage of the situation, torturing others, stealing money, and generally being overall evil.

The spoken English and subtitle English seems to be the same (except the profanity which is only in the subtitles, and I believe that occasionally a couple words are different).  The dubbing isn't the best, though it is harder to tell considering that it isn't always easy to see their mouths.

The slow movie has a somewhat strange story-line (not enough of the resistance action shown, not enough of any action, really, shown).  The acting appears to be good.  The music is good.  Overall, I would give the movie 3.40 stars.",1119225600,,4273,4.872752420470262
7886980,3,6305261431,"I will leave the other reviewers of 'Hong Kong 1941' to analyze the film for you. I have written this review to inform potential customers that the English subtitles on this Fox Home Entertainment edition are not up-to standards, especially for a major movie company such as Fox. There are some spelling (!!) errors but the most annoying aspect of them are that there are basic English grammatical mistakes. I watched the movie in the original Chinese audio with English subtitles and was duly disappointed.

The movie itself is ok and quite enjoyable, yet the subtitles are a major nuisance. Not only are they poorly done, but there are times throughout the movie where conversation is heard for quite a while, and you are certain subtitles are needed, but they never appear! Thus, the inevitable consequence is that at times, the movie lacks fluidity if you want to watch the movie in its original audio (The English dubbed version is very bad as well).

The picture and sound 'quality' on the DVD are great, but the subtitles simply ruin it.",1116374400,7,1044,4.794444444444444
7886981,5,6305261431,"I adore this film.  I have watched it millions of times, and it never gets old. I started watching it because i wanted to learn to speak Cantonese, but i soon realized that this movie is actually quite a masterpiece.  There is romance, action, and a bittersweet twist at the end.  You really need to see this movie!",1114646400,,315,4.396551724137931
7886982,3,6305261431,"I saw this in a video format in the sale accidentally yesterday, the only copy left.  There are so few movies made about this period in the history of Hong Kong, my birth place (  I might not have been able to keep up-to-date with the movies produced there.) I grabbed this one out of sheer necessity to know something about my homeland and my people. The thing that struck me most is the wonderful expression on the face of Chow Yun-Fat who conveys the  transformation of an easy-going, ambitious young man to a real man who loves his country, who summons up the courage, dignity, intelligence, profound human dignity, and calmness to face down the brutal, devious, humiliating conquest by a foreign power.  The other main actors are also quite good.  Overall, the movie struggles a bit between being an epic of monumental historical importance and the intimate stories of three young people.  But to a Chinese like myself, the opportunity to enter into the mind and world of a character such as Chow is gratifying enough.  Chinese people are very serious about their national identity, and being a traitor is just the worst thing if one is a Chinese.  China did not fall to the Japanese despite being vastly  overwhelmed by the enemy's military might because there were enough, far more than enough, Chinese who were like Chow's character.",1096848000,,1341,4.770562770562771
7886983,2,6305261431,"I like Hong Kong Cinema and have seen several of the Neo style Hong Kong classics from the mid eighties to the mid ninties.  In fact a couple of the reviews I read here peeked my interrest in watching it.  I have to say however, that this film was a real snoozer for me.
The plot centers around three freinds who stick together during the Japanese occuapation of 1941.  During this time the British have been temporarily defeated in Hong Kong, and several Hong Kong residents turn on there own in order to profit from the Japnaese.  Chow Yun-Fat and his two new found friends scheme to escape Hong Kong but are delayed when they fail to make it out together.  Over the course of the film Chow Yun-Fat and Ceclia Yip begin to develope an attraction to one another, even though she is arleady attached.  A pathetic love triangle type scenario starts to arise but is never fully realized.  Things between the three sort themselves out in the end.  I won't spoil it for you.
I tried watching Hong Kong 1941 twice and had a hard time getting into it.  I finally finished it the second time but was unimpressed with the characters and their plight.  The love triangle never goes anywhere, the Japanese occupation is not potrayed well enough, (in my opinion) and the side plots seem like filler to make the movie more dramatic and lengthy.
One of my two stars is for Chow Yun-Fat's presence, which probally saved the film from bombing.  The second is for the occassionl  stunnig cinematography throughout the film. Other than than that, I can't think of anything else deserving of a star.
I'll also worn those of you who view this film on the DVD release from 20th Centruy Fox. (subsiderary is Fortune Star)  The Englsih dub version is awful and makes the film seem more like a cheap B movie with it's poor choice of voice dubbing actors (particualarly Chow Yun-Fat and Ceclia Yips characters) and the re-orchestrated synthiser sounding score which replaces the original films score is just as awful. At least they included the origianl language track and score which was a good choice on the part of 20th Century Fox. It makes the movie easier to take. 20th Century should take some lessons from Taiseng's recent releases.  They take the job of dubbing and scoring more seriously.
Overall I would say if you're interested in Hong Kong 1941 you might consider renting it.  I can't really recommend it, but who knows, maybe you'll find more in it to admire than I did.",1061251200,7,2460,4.622988505747126
