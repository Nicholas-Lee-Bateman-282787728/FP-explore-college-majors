3725765,5,B001O287YO,"This documentary is about the Vietnam War.

The title says it all.

The documentary includes first person testimony by U.S. Vietnam veterans who actively conducted the war, Vietnamese civilians who experienced the war, and various political figures and news commentators from the period.

It is an accurate and objective testimony to the falsehoods used by U.S. leaders to create war and the atrocities committed by U.S. personnel as a matter of ""standard operating procedure"".

I strongly recommend this to any one who is a Republican who supports the U.S. war machine.  Learn more about the consequences of your beliefs.",1284768000,15,622,5.242424242424242

figures are correct  The truth took over forty years to come out, but it did.",1399680000,,160,4.888888888888889
8328849,5,B001O287YO,"To really enjoy this movie, watch ""Fog of War"" one night
Then Daniel Ellsberg ""The most dangerous man in america"" the next night
And finally Vietnam:American Holocaust
This could be the final word on the Vietnam War Experience
Its a must See!!!!!  and a must Have!!!! just for the facts alone!!!!!
If you thought that Apocalypse Now; was dark
The reality of that War was much more stark by comparison.
If the truth will set you free
Then this needs to be seen on tv (CBS,NBC,ABC, Fox,..etc) every veterans day for at least a decade (Prime time Only)",1363737600,4,549,4.6020408163265305
8328850,5,B001O287YO,"VIETNAM: AMERICAN HOLOCAUST is one of the best DVD documentaries when it comes to Vietnam War. History of the country of Vietnam politically and what US did inside Vietnam. Nick Turse wrote a book, Kill Anything That Moves: The Real American War in Vietnam after piling facts for ten years, which is exactly what happened in Vietnam. That is not the America that you think you know. Disturbing, disgusting and unbelievable. Bravo.",1363132800,3,430,4.986111111111111
8328851,5,B001O287YO,"We now grieve the slaughter of Native Americans and the Jewish Holocaust, but we think we've learned and risen above those evil historic events. Now, we're in danger of placing the Vietnam war into the same amnesic category. Yet there are plenty of living veterans willing to speak of the horrors and, EVER MORE IMPORTANTLY, to draw parallels to US military actions & foreign policies since then, right up to Afghanistan & drones in Pakistan today.

The real importance of this film isn't to document former atrocities but to wake people up to the atrocities that continue TODAY, in our names, with our tax dollars, tacitly approved by our indifference, and perhaps with your votes.

This movie shockingly conveys the reality of war, and don't think it's any more moral today than it was in Vietnam. Brace yourself for a difficult education. I thought I knew the atrocities committed in Vietnam, but this greatly expanded my awareness. ""Best"" of all, it uses archival footage so one sees & feels for oneself rather than being asked to believe the judgements of talking heads. Listen to LBJ, Gen Curtis LeMay, and others talk about killing the bastards. Listen to guilt-ridden soldiers baring their hearts. Watch them kill ""gooks"". Listen to Vietnamese tell how their families were brutally slaughtered. This is tough to watch but ought to be mandatory viewing for anybody who supports any aspect of our foreign wars or support of other foreign wars.

Be sure to show it to any young person who might ever consider joining the military. The truth ain't pretty, but it's TRUE!",1354233600,3,1574,4.909774436090226
8328852,5,B001O287YO,"Not for the faint of heart, this well-researched documentary for the most part tells it like it was. If you're interested in the historic timeline of conflict in Vietnam, if you really want to understand the brutality of war, and if you're curious about why other nations don't necessarily share our world view of being ""the greatest nation on Earth"", buy this DVD. It will shock you.

The premise is that our effort was doomed from the start because we measured our success by body counts. The reality was that we became trapped in a war where civilians and warriors were often indistinguishable and the enemy was willing to absorb millions of civilian and military losses until our political will to fight was broken.

Having been a grunt in Vietnam, I've read dozens of excellent books and first-person accounts about my war. This work, especially the historic timeline, have helped me a great deal to make sense out of my personal experience. It also reinforced my conclusion that blind patriotism without questioning our political and military leadership can be dangerous; There are over 58,000 names written on The Wall as proof.",1350604800,5,1135,4.93717277486911
8328853,5,B001O287YO,The video absorbs your attention with the verbal and visual truth without using intemperate language or false information.  It is gripping and will challenge the integrity of any person who watches it.  We need its truth.,1346889600,3,221,5.111111111111111
8328854,1,B001O287YO,"This so-called film with an ""objective"" view is nothing more than an anti-war propaganda film. The film is nothing near objective with its stilted dialogue. The figure of 5 million killed by the Americans is very misleading as 5 million deaths would cover the entire number of people killed on BOTH sides. I know the North Vietnamese claimed not to have killed ANY Vietnamese but you would have to be awfully silly to believe that. The fact is, they killed an estimated one MILLION South Vietnamese AFTER the war's end in their ""re-education"" camps in addition to those killed during their 21 year conflict with the South. This purports the war to have been one of ""independence"" but the North and South were both independent as of 1954 and before the North invaded the people of the South. The end result was not independence either. The people of Vietnam are anything but free. There is a Communist dictatorship in the countryside and a Fascist police state in the big cities. I lived there for seven years and even I was not free to speak my mind honestly and openly. Do NOT believe the message of this film!! Seek out your own answers...",1343001600,2,1141,4.653465346534653
8328855,5,B001O287YO,"Vietnam: American Holocaust opens in the present day at the Veterans for Peace Arlington West Memorial to the fallen US soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan in Santa Monica. Here the strong connection between our current wars and the war in Vietnam is first made. The question of what makes a holocaust is also raised. Then the scene shifts to the Vietnam Memorial Wall in Washington D.C. and while the narration continues it is revealed that the youngest US soldier to die in Vietnam was a Black Marine age 15.

A clip of Vietnam era Defense Secretary Robert McNamara in Hanoi in 1995 shows him saying that 3.4 million Vietnamese were killed during the war. Futher news clips from the time reveal some of the horrors of that war and show that news commentators referred to it as a holocaust at the time.

This is followed by a brief history of the 19th century French conquest of Indochina and the Vietnamese liberation struggle from 1945 through the defeat of the French in 1954. This is done with archival footage, much of it very rare, and Martin Sheen's excellent narration and the voices of the principals on both sides of the conflict. Since the focus of the documentary is the American War in Vietnam the pace slows as more details are given about this part of the history.

The reasons for opposing the Vietnamese independence struggle are given by President Eisenhower in a clip from one of his speeches. Then the young Ho Chi Minh is introduced, with special attention to his time in Harlem, NY and his relationship with Marcus Garvey. Again very old and rare footage is used to illustrate these years while Mr. Sheen describes the crucial events.

The story of the lead up to the American war is presented with footage that also includes Roosevelt, Truman, Kennedy, Diem, Gerald Ford, Joe McCarthy, Nixon, Senator Morse, and many others. We hear Bobby Kennedy question the NSC plans for a coup in South Vietnam only weeks before President Kennedy is assassinated. In another connection to the present conflicts, we learn of the role the Kennedy administration played in putting Saddam Hussein in power in Iraq.

Since the Tonkin Gulf incident played such a big role in promoting and justifying the war, the film goes into considerable detail about it. Through interviews with the captain of the US ship that was allegedly attacked, the chief gunner, a North Vietnamese general and the recollections of pilots that flew air cover on the fateful night, it shows that this attack never happened. Most significantly, using White House tapes released only a few years ago, it shows that McNamara and LBJ had foreknowledge of this phony attack that never took place. This material has never been used in a documentary before.

The next segment illustrates the incredible damage done to Vietnam by the massive US air war which included bombing, napalm and agent orange. With a particularly potent instrumental from the Mama's Boys blues band that provides the sound track for the film, we hear from LBJ, Curtis LeMay, a Hanoi doctor, Vietnamese victims, and American airmen among others in a way that really brings home the brutality of the air war. The agent orange section will send chills up your spine.

From there the film goes into the horrific ground war that was the real holocaust in Vietnam. This is done through the voices of American and Vietnamese soldiers and civilians that give you a real window into the tragedy of war on a human level. The Vietnam War was a My Lai every week and this point is driven home by recounting some of the many other massacres that took place. Extremely graphic images are used in this segment. You are witness to real deaths happening on the screen. You will understand why so many Vietnam vets came home with a great deal of mental anguish because of what they saw in this war.

Finally we return to Arlington West in the present and the Iraq War. Again the point is made that those that forget their history are doomed to repeat it and a plea is made both by Martin Sheen and the director, Clay Claiborne, to stop this madness.",1305072000,20,4075,4.7376586741889986
8328856,5,B001O287YO,"Having spent nine months in Vietnam researching aspects of the war,I am thoroughly impressed with the honesty and accuracy of this documentary. The Zippo village patrol system saw villages burnt to the ground on a whim, and Holocaust shows that. The sheer barbarity of the Free Fire Zones, the brutal interrogation of prisoners or suspects, the murderous Phoenix program and corruption in the South are only a few issues covered. If you buy one DVD of the Vietnam War, make it this one. If you can afford two, add The Most Dangerous Man in America. Bravo, Mr Claiborne",1302393600,12,568,4.8061224489795915
