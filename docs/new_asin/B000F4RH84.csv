2551108,3,B000F4RH84,"It was good to see Stacy Dash on screen again appearing as cute as she looked in clueless,but her acting skills remain the same,

flat,unemotional and stiff. Great views of Los Angelas all and all this movie would have completely flopped if it would have been released in theatres, but it's something okay to watch if you are chillin on a rainy day with nothing else to do.",1153958400,3,373,4.485294117647059
2551109,5,B000F4RH84,The best part in the movie is where Bill Belamy's character does a strip tease for Vivica Fox.  It is funny and SEXY at the same time!,1151539200,5,134,3.962962962962963
2551110,2,B000F4RH84,This movie had a good concept but the first part of the movie it was like Vivica Foxx wanted to showcase her body because she's over forty and the acting was not great.  Carmen Electra was okay and Stacy Dash who I didn't know was 39 looks good but her acting is the same from when she was in Mo Money.  Bill Bellemy is still playing the same role but I was glad to see that he has been working out.  Sheryl Underwood must be trying to promote herself since she was in this and Something New which is way better than this movie.  I wouldn't have released this in the theatre too.  I think the ending was a bit cheesy.  It should have ended with the guy getting played in the end.  I'm tired of these movies that try to wrap it in a bow in the end.  Dash should have figured it out and played him and left him in the end.  Then the movie would have been true to the name,1150934400,5,869,3.9482758620689653
2551111,2,B000F4RH84,"Stacy Dash is still stuffed. I love that Chick. Vivica A Fox&Carmen Electria are banging as well. Bill Bellamy is in another Broke Boomerang meets How to be a Player type role that is very predictable,but has a few aight moments. not alot going on.",1150848000,2,248,4.533333333333333
2551112,5,B000F4RH84,Once again Vivica Fox did her thang in this movie i am loving her in these aggressive roles she's playing,1363564800,,105,4.3
2551113,5,B000F4RH84,"What I liked about this movie was that it was not like any chick flick, It was funny and has a great soundtrack to it.",1358121600,,118,3.76
2551114,5,B000F4RH84,great movie and great acting. This dvd continues to be watched and enjoyed by a host of friends and family.,1355702400,,107,4.4
2551115,4,B000F4RH84,"Getting Played was funny. Three friends make a bet and there are funny results. The bet is mean spirited. Stacey Dash character is a nice person and she gets caught up in a lot of drama. She made the movie for me because she played a decent person who was looking for love. Recommended for fans of ViVica, Stacey and Carmen. The moral of the story is to be honest when you are dating and don't play games with peoples feelings.",1354924800,,427,4.283950617283951
2551116,4,B000F4RH84,Great movie!!! A total recommendation for anyone who likes to educate themselves on the opposite sex. It was everything I was looking for in a movie!,1354665600,,149,4.769230769230769

2551118,3,B000F4RH84,"I found it somewhat predictable but overall still enjoyable.  Carmen, Stacy, & Vivica provide plenty of PG-13 eye candy for the guys.  There are also buff shirtless guys for the ladies.",1273449600,2,185,4.935483870967742
2551119,3,B000F4RH84,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Getting-Played-Soundtrack-Who-is/dp/B000F4RH84/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Getting Played Soundtrack (Who is?)</a>As the title suggests this is not an audio CD or the soundtrack from the movie which is very good but this is the movie.  I have mixed feelings about the choice for lead actor but he did a good job in the roll.  The three ladies were very good with solid performances all around.  The story is a bit unbelievable but the director makes it all work.  As to exactly what you will see, I'm not going to give that away but this is an entertaining movie with a few surprises.  Surprise Vivica takes most of it off and so does Carmen but I really liked the character played by Stacey.  Too agressive can be misinterpreted in a woman and the ""B"" word often slips out.  Obviously this is a love story where true love wins out overall but I'm not happy with the sterotype that all hetero males are ready to jump any attractive woman that comes along but bellamy does a good job playing and getting played to his own harm and near loss of a good thing in Ms Dash.  Also cameos by comedians ""Earthquake"" and Tachina Arnold from the old ""Martin"" sitcom ""Martin Lawrence"" were very funny.",1208217600,,1258,4.985645933014354
2551120,5,B000F4RH84,"I NEVER LIKED BILL BELLEMAY UNTILL I SEEN THIS FILM,I LAUGHED SO HARD TILL I WAS ROLLING,THE SCENE WHERE HE WAS DANCING FOR VIVICAL FOX,WAS HILARIOUS, YOU GUYS WILL LOVE THIS ONE TRUST ME...LOL",1191542400,2,193,4.705882352941177
2551121,2,B000F4RH84,"I thought this movie was so boring.  It was so trying to be Two can play that game, but nowhere near as good.  The practically going straight to video should've been my cue, but alas I gave it a try on account of Vivica.  I am very thankful that I did not buy it and only rented it.  In my opinion it wasn't funny, it wasn't sexy yet it seemed like it was attempting to be a romantic comedy. I kid you not, the only part in the movie that I did laugh at was Ticia Arnold and the man she was with and the bloopers at the end.  That's pretty bad.  Trust me, save your money and your time.",1170028800,7,586,3.841666666666667

8117321,4,B000F4RH84,"I found the film ""Getting Played"" to be very enjoyable to watch but certainly not a classic.  The plot was reasonably predictable and the ending was just what I expected.  Stacy Dash as the least aggressive of the three women involved ended up with the man just by not being aggressive.

The cast was excellent and very attractive.  Vivica A. Fox was fine but I have seen her perform better in other roles like ""Kill Bill."" Carmen Electra was pretty funny, but I truly do not believe that she is a great actress, just average.  Her role was well written but she definitely did not excel in it.  Stacy Dash is lovely but her acting skills are not great.  She was fine in ""Clueless"" but in this film she was okay as a very vulnerable woman.  All in all, I would say that Bill Bellamy was the best performer in this film.  Tichina Arnold was only utilized in the very last few minutes of the film as was the comedian Earthquake.

It is interesting to know that Vivica Fox was one of the producers of this film and it shows that there are not enough roles for Black actresses in Hollywood so they have to create their own roles.

The scenery and the music and the clothes of the performers were fine.  This movie came out in 2004 and I do not think that most people remember it or would watch it now.  I watched it, enjoyed it and would watch it again but I would not necessarily recommend it to others.  It would help if you know and like the stars of this flick. The supporting characters do make the most of their limited time on screen.  Well, edited.",1406160000,,1551,4.3
8117322,4,B000F4RH84,"Typical Vivica Fox type comedy. I really enjoyed on a Lazy afternoon. The ending was predictable, but still worth watching.",1397692800,,123,5.2

It stated that it couldn't play for this region???? Now I have to send it back. I've never had a problem until this particular DVD.",1374969600,,296,4.120689655172414
8117326,5,B000F4RH84,"I like this movie and recommend it to my friends. It's a cute little tale with plenty laughs in between the story line. If you get a chance to check out the bloopers, please do! They always put a smile on my face!",1373155200,,213,3.9767441860465116
