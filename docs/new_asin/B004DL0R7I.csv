4332679,2,B004DL0R7I,Expected little and was still disappointed.....shoulda passed on this one....I hope this helps you to not make the mistake I did and waste your money renting this awful flick.,1315008000,3,175,5.068965517241379
4332680,1,B004DL0R7I,"Here's 90% of the movie: Victim tries to make an escape, then doesn't. Victim tries to make an escape, then doesn't. Victim tries to make an escape, then doesn't, etc. The actors hop back and forth between the same two rooms. Then you see the victim is capable of hurting other innocent people, but can't do anything to the one in charge, even though there are tons of makeshift weapons around her.

The acting by some of the actors is questionable. The blood looks like some cranberry syrup you can get at IHOP. I've seen better film quality on youtube.

The only thing I can commend the movie for is what the victim discovers. Other than that, I'm sorry I spent $1.99 on this....

If you want to see how one's psyche may make a turn for the worse or better in an extreme situation, go watch ""I Am Legend"".",1310860800,12,807,4.366666666666666
4332681,3,B004DL0R7I,"This movie was quite unique and have never seen anything quite as gruesome.  If you are looking for gore, this is your movie.  Just when I thought I had seen something over the top, something else happens that is even more distgusting and unthinkable. This movie is a must see with a group of equally minded scary movie fans.  It will be enjoyed by all.",1303862400,,353,4.4
4332682,4,B004DL0R7I,"Firstly: yes, that is how it's spelled. With that out of the way, there's a line from Videodrome that's appropriate here: ""It has a philosophy -- and that's what makes it dangerous."" On one level, this could be seen simply as torture-porn, with Zoey (Sanders) awakening to find herself in a underground bunker. There's been an outbreak of something very nasty above ground, it appears, and she is now trapped with a doctor (Tulin), and an apparently insane nurse. However, as events unfold, it becomes clear that it's the doctor who is the one who has all the issues here, and with the world outside out of bounds, Zoey has to decide how far she is prepared to go along with his psychotic actions, in order to survive. The answer is, much further than you would probably expect. The scene which demonstrates this most convincingly is one which explicitly evokes the infamous Milgram Experiments of the 1960's at Yale, which found out that about two-thirds of participants would inflict what they believed to be lethal electric shocks on others, at the verbal urging of an authority figure. There, of course, the 'punishment' was faked: in the depths of Das Bunker and at the crazed hands of Herr Doctor - not so much.

The 'twist' towards the end is not exactly much of a surprise - we worked it out almost at the beginning. Fortunately, this is not M. Night Shyamalan, and the movie doesn't rely on it for impact [a double twist came to mind, which would have been impressive, if pulled off]. Tulin delivers a very unsettling performance, with every line and look conveying just how far gone he is beyond sanity. Sanders is less obvious, of necessity, and Zoey has much more of a character arc to play with, while the script is carefully written to work within the budgetary limitations [it's almost all set in one location]. If it certainly contains its fair share of scenes that will make the viewer squirm or go ""Ew!"", the progression of Zoey from victim to unwilling participant to active perpetrator should also make you wonder how far you might be willing to go, given the necessary circumstances and provocation. It's probably no coincidence that the director has a master's degree in psychology - and that's why I say the film has a philosophy. This is what lifts it up above its retarded cinematic cousins, and why it'll stick in your mind when Saw VI has long been forgotten.",1296345600,5,2386,4.708133971291866
4332683,4,B004DL0R7I,"This unique indie horror film combines elements of both torture films (like Saw) and zombie films to come up with one of the most disturbing and gruesome films I've ever reviewed. The film never holds back on scenes depicting psychological, physical, and sexual torment and leaves them burning in your head long after the film is over. The film is well shot and I really like the colors used in the film; they set the tone for the entire film much like the pale greens did for the Saw films. I will say that in between the scenes of torture, I found the film to be kinda slow and you could see wholes in the plot, but just the sheer uncomfortable feeling you get while watching this movie makes up for that. If your not a die hard horror fan, I have a feeling you might not be able to handle just how brutal this film gets. It truly is disturbing and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it...three times...",1293494400,3,900,4.363095238095238
4332684,4,B004DL0R7I,"In the midst of preparing for a weekend trip Zoey [Cari Sanders] is suddenly overcome with dizziness and faints. Men with gas masks move in and transfer her to an underground facility that was set up as a nuclear fallout station. Now it's being used to house the survivors of a viral outbreak that had a 99.9% kill rate. A rare few dropped into a deep coma for days before awakening, untouched by the virus. The station is run by a bizarre and sinister doctor [Will Tulin], who is recruiting survivors for his own plan to restore the population of the world. He treats Zoey with kindness at first, but gradually his plan to subordinate her will to his own becomes clear. The question is, will Zoey agree to help him with his plan, or rebel?

The real experiments that this story is based on showed that ordinary people could do terrible things in high stress situations when ordered to do so by a superior. Shelter shows us, step by step, how such behavior could occur in an emergency. The relationship between the doctor and Zoey is fascinatingly complex, and the surrealistic, just-over-the-edge presentation of events works very effectively to show how a person could become a monster in a crisis. Shelter will make you ask what you would do, and will not let you off with any easy answers.",1292371200,9,1293,4.621739130434783
8425579,1,B004DL0R7I,"Ugh. Well, I admit, I didn't do my homework on this one and, on a lazy Sunday, just went with the DVD cover art and the ""I should have known better"" pasting of ""Official Selection of the Mom's Basement Film Festival Award"" laurels. Lousy acting, lame and predictable-from-the-start plot, below-par acting. Good for gore fans, but not for anyone interested in a good story or anything with thrills or scares or even any psychological angle. In the end (well, actually, even from the start), it's just another boring microbudget b-horror straight-to-video time-waster. Torture porn and/or gore fans may get some slight enjoyment, though, if that's a subgenre you enjoy. I found it only a waste of time and money.",1418515200,,710,4.974789915966387

8425581,2,B004DL0R7I,"The acting by the main character was pretty good. The secondary character was terrible. That doesn't make for a very good indie. Especially when interaction between characters is key. The storyline was OK, but executed with weak enthusiasm. Watching was like being stuck in front of a school film. Indies with similar storylines have far surpassed the efforts of Shelter. It's not worth the watch. The thumbnail image is more entertaining.",1395964800,2,439,5.197183098591549
8425582,2,B004DL0R7I,Its ok but not worth the time it takes to watch the movie. I guess it gives you something to do if you are bored.,1381968000,,113,3.56
8425583,1,B004DL0R7I,"If you like to watch nothing but blood, gore and torture just for the fun of it, you will love this movie. They should have named this movie ""Crazy doctor goes wild"". The other reviews will give you an idea of the storyline.  Yes, the story leaves you with a personal question.

8425584,1,B004DL0R7I,"I saw this last night, and in all honesty..the gore and certain other things that I will not mention, was just done for shock value. I think most of us have noticed, that some reviews on here for these low budget indie films, are from people who worked on or were in that particular film. I do not know how this film received six awards from the various indie film circuits, but I'm glad I only payed $1.99 for this rental. There was no deep meaning in this film as others have suggested, regarding what we would do to survive. If you do still wish to watch this film...wait till its 99 cents,but you'll never get back those 90 minutes of your life.",1367452800,2,649,4.284552845528455

8425588,3,B004DL0R7I,Too bad this movie didn't have a budget worth a damn. I thought the two main characters did a fair job of acting. I have seen much worse films with much larger budgets. I would like to see this film re-made with a bigger budget and more character development.,1322438400,4,259,4.3061224489795915
