8048803,4,B0007M6ORE,"Great video. Youssouf is a master and has a beautiful expression of ballet dance from Guinea, West Africa. But, be forewarned that it is a video cassette, not a DVD.",1387152000,,165,4.533333333333333
8048804,5,B0007M6ORE,"Great video for beginner and intermediate African dancers.  Yossouf clearly demonstrates the proper way to do each step. As well, he gives the origin, and purpose of each dance.  This video is even great for beginner African djembe drummers since the djembe break is demonstrated for each associated dance.",1245196800,3,306,5.224489795918367
