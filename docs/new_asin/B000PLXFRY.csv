2825239,5,B000PLXFRY,I received this DVD today and viewed it in one sitting. The techniques used in this DVD are excellent. In the massage therapy classes I am currently taking they included chair massage as one of the electives we are to study and I can honestly say that Diana's techniques were much more advanced than what I was shown in class.,1214438400,,326,4.45
2825240,5,B000PLXFRY,"This really one of the best, most thorough, and professional massage videos I've seen.  There's so much information in this video, both technical and practical, that you'll need to watch it several times to begin to remember it all.

Not only is the production excellent and the techniques well demonstrated and explained, but the therapist herself is obviously both a wonderful person as well as a seasoned professional.

In addition to demonstrating numerous techniques sufficient to perform a 30-minute chair massage, the video also includes a 15-minute timed routine that you can practice along with to establish your own basic routine.  A timer on screen shows the elapsed time.

Before watching this video, I was under the impression that chair massage was just a quick-and-dirty, second-rate form of massage for people who cannot afford a full-hour table massage.  I was wrong.  Chair massage is actually more technically complex and difficult to master than table massage.  Yet it is far cheaper and easier way to launch your massage career.

I can see now that most chair massages performed at fairs and in malls are not at all what chair massage is supposed to be like.  This video shows you the real McCoy.  I feel that anyone who mastered the techniques in this video and worked hard could develop a massage practice that would outstrip the earnings of an established table-massage business.",1209945600,20,1403,5.056521739130435
2825241,5,B000PLXFRY,"I was looking for a simple, yet detailed instructional DVD for quickly learning the basics of chair massage and that is EXACTLY what I got!!!  I would definitely recommend this product to any massage therapist who needs a quick reference to either learning chair massage for the first time...or for a quick and easy refresher! Thanks a bunch! :)",1205712000,13,345,4.8474576271186445
2825242,5,B000PLXFRY,"I am a massage therapist who was looking for a quick ""refresher"" on seated massage before a marketing event I was participating in. In the past, I've been disappointed with massage DVDs I've purchased because they didn't provide many new insights for the money spent. Not so with this one! Very good value for the money and provided a lot of useful techniques for chair massage.",1203638400,2,378,4.742424242424242
2825243,5,B000PLXFRY,"I knew nothing of chair massage before watching this DVD, but I found the techniques easy to understand.  As she manipulates an area of the body, the 'muscle/skeleton' side bar was very informative.  I could visualize the muscle's location and how to effectively massage it.  I've practiced the routines on friends and have had to review the DVD several times to catch something I've missed.  A procedure looked simple in the DVD, but sometimes it was just a matter of how you stood or how you gripped a muscle.  After reviewing a technique, my mistakes became glaringly obvious.  This speaks for the visual quality and professionalism of the DVD.  I highly recommend it.",1197417600,16,671,4.884955752212389
2825244,4,B000PLXFRY,"My favorite part about this video is the timer in the corner. When she does that full (15 or 30 you can choose) it helps you see how much time is should actually be spent on each move so you get your timing down.

There's no obnoxious music and she speaks clearly the camera angles aren't bad. I wish the teacher was shorter so I could see how short people manage pressure though. I'm 5 2"" I can't reach everywhere on my taller bulkier clients.

She uses anatomy terms so that you also get an anatomy refresher and palpation as you watch. There's one point she has a skeleton on the chair heh so you can see what your pressure does and where to follow along the bony prominences.

I'd add this to your collection if you're just started out or want to brush up on chair massage. Maybe there are techniques you haven't seen before and you can use to change it up a bit so it's not boring for you :D But I'd say it's a good beginner one.

It's broken down into chapters. As she slowly breaks down and speaks with you on each section she's working on. She also educates you on your posture. After that (or you can skip ahead) can select 15 or 30 minute final demonstration and practice along with her.",1190505600,14,1197,4.2368421052631575
2825245,5,B000PLXFRY,"I can not say enough about this DVD!  Diana Haynes shows you hands on techniques that are practical, technical (but not overwhelming), and beneficial to add to your massage repertoire or tool belt. Anatomical illustrations are used as she speaks in a conversational manner. She will show you basic routines.

There may be other DVD series on chair massage techniques; however, I would recommend this DVD wholeheartedly!  I have two DVD's that stand out among the others in my collection.  They are both produced by Real Bodywork. (The other is Deep Tissue and Neuromuscular Therapy with Sean Riehi.)  As in many things you certainly get what you pay for.  There may be other DVD's that are less expensive, but this is the best I have found.  I would have paid twice as much for the information that was contained on this DVD.  Thank you Real Bodywork!  I will be a repeat customer!",1183852800,38,881,4.743421052631579

2825262,2,B000PLXFRY,"I bought this DVD from a massage magazine and it is an okay DVD, but I would have been better off watching the movements at YouTube and saved my money.  This video shows the basics; it is a ripoff.",1413763200,,197,4.051282051282051

2825271,5,B000PLXFRY,This lady is truly a master. I was willing to become digital just to be able to jump into the computer screen and be the one in her massage chair.  I was very impressed with her techhnique.  She made deep tissue massage look so much easier to perform than it actually is.  So I'm grateful for her explicit description of each massage stroke.  Her use of terminology in reference to musculoskeletal anatomy inspired me to brush off some off my educational videos.  She inspired me to improve my skill.  And I appreciate her tips for good customer service.,1395619200,,554,4.6020408163265305

It also has a lot of techniques that I didn't know off, which is great",1370476800,,283,4.2592592592592595
2825288,2,B000PLXFRY,"Pros - affective techniques, sound, picture, viewing angle, excellent descriptions and demonstration, good marketing tips, easy to understand, great instructor, some much needed info for beginners, addresses anterior muscles, good for seasoned therapists--especially those who can modify for safety and professional touch, good lower body mechanics.

Cons - poor hand mechanics on many techniques (too much thumbs and torquing of therapist's wrist joints), advanced therapists need more information about key common trigger points--especially satellites, too much client contact with her body (leaning against her breast and belly as she addresses anterior muscles and some stretches). She has such a nice maternal persona and cushy belly, that it may work for her. But, I wouldn't advise it.

As a massage / stretch therapist, I have techniques with equipment that allow me to include similar supported stretches without the direct body contact. Thus I can use some of her techniques without the questionable contact.

I specialize in overuse injuries. Too much of these thumb techniques will cut your career short. Considering that injury is a leading cause of a huge number of therapists leaving the massage profession yearly, that's a pretty big down side to the video.

It is still a worthwhile investment; use with caution. If it was tweaked to give ergonomically safe hand techniques and avoid the questionable body contact, I'd give it 5 stars.

http://www.amtamassage.org/articles/3/MTJ/detail/2593 is a free article advising how to avoid such injuries.",1369267200,26,1562,5.601694915254237

Pros - techniques, sound, picture, viewing angle, excellent descriptions and demonstration, marketing portion, easy to understand, great instructor
Cons - lot of thumbs

I changed my review from a 3 to 5 to 4. I recommend the viewer to watch this dvd several times as you will most likely miss the details in the descriptions. Techniques can look very similar but minor variations in the application have a huge impact on the effectiveness of those techniques. For example the directions may say 'compress medially, pull superiorly, and push laterally'. This is far superior to merely circling your thumbs over muscle tissue and skin. I recommend this video and am pleased with my purchase.

I encourage anyone already familiar with chair massage or looking for advanced techniques to check out Advanced Therapeutic Chair Massage with Patrick Ingrassia. AMAZING. With these two dvds, I have everything I need for an amazing chair massage routine.",1346803200,4,1061,5.192982456140351

2825296,4,B000PLXFRY,"Very good DVD.  The instructions were straight-forward and explained well as to why a stroke is done and what anatomy is affacted by it.  Camera angles and production was good.  The 15 minute routine makes for a good starting point for those like myself who are trying to become more proficient at chair massage.

My only complaint from an LMT standpoint is a lot of thumbwork is demonstrated in this video.  If you are doing a several hours long chair event your thumbs probably won't survive if you use these techniques.  You may want to adapt her chair moves to your knuckles or braced fingertips.",1335052800,7,600,4.666666666666667
2825297,5,B000PLXFRY,Diana Haynes takes her time explaining and showing you how to improve on your chair massage and using a skeleton before starting an actual massage so that we can see the bone structure she will be working with...is great. Massage therapist need to visualize in their mind the bone structure and muscle they are working on along with our touch.  I would greatly enjoy being in a classroom with this woman.  She also gives you great ideas about how you can use the chair massage to expand your practice or make it your only practice.,1329177600,,531,4.578947368421052

The information is clear, the techniques not very complicated or technical and the 15 minute practice at the end is AWESOME for timing and practice at home.",1219104000,7,477,4.386363636363637

Everyone loved the chair massage work I did at the chair massage event I went to and thought I was a pro and did chair massage for years...lol. Highly, recommend this DVD to everyone!",1479600000,,336,4.435483870967742

8192339,5,B000PLXFRY,"My wife and I use Diana's techniques in all our chair massage (we adlib a bit of course, who doesn't?) but it her video was how I trained and people really love it.  The 15 min routine is perfect for our donations of time to Relay for Life or working with office staff.  Great instruction.  We actually have two copies because we don't want to be without.  Thanks, Diana! You made me a reasonably decent masseuse.",1470096000,,413,4.394736842105263
