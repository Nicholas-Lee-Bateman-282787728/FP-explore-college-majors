8479713,5,B0027P9NFE,"Christina Morales is a young and beautiful actress, whose skills spill bountifully over into her creative roles as writer and director of Dreammaker, a very unique and different kind of film. The characters are extremely entertaining, yet there is a quality that comes through them that becomes deeper and more engaging as the film unfolds. Watching this film from start to finish, left me with a very sweet and satisfied feeling. It is  not to be missed.
