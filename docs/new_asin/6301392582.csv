7811447,2,6301392582,"This is a pretty standard Fox-style early 90's 'Investigative' special, originally shown with the rather bizarre title ""UFO Cover-Up? Live!"".

This was a live broadcast and fares worse than most do, even for the period.  This is featured with an inordinate amount of flubbed lines, overlapping or missed cues, continuity errors, and even one point where the host literally loses his place on the cue card and actually says "".um......."" to fill in a couple of seconds.

I wouldn't spend any serious money on this, but if you live on a steady diet of these types of documentaries, it might be good for a giggle.",1403308800,,609,4.780952380952381
