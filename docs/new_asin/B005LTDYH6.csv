8478564,3,B005LTDYH6,"This was a somewhat entertaining supernatural Slasher that has pretty good acting, nice scenery seeing as it was filmed on and off of a river in Florida. Filled with lush greenery and trees.

The group of Twenty somethings travel to an ancient area where sacrificial rituals used to be performed. The grounds themselves can tell if you are pure of heart or guilty of an unforgivable sin. It drags for about the first 40 minutes or so, save one Tame kill in the beginning during a flashback.

As each of the characters sins come back to haunt them ""some are unforgivable"" they meet a violent death. There is some gore and the effects are pretty well done but it still left me wanting more. It's OK for a rental but I don't think many people would watch it twice.",1425513600,,761,4.467625899280575

8478566,3,B005LTDYH6,"Since I live in Florida, I was curious to see how the Florida wilderness would be portrayed.  This was filmed in the summer when  subtropical growth would be at its peak.  Green foliage would hide all view of the ground.  Each step in the woods would be scary since you wouldn't know what was under all that foliage.  Could be dirt and insects or it could be a cottonmouth or other poisonous snake.  The woods as depicted are a pleasant site for a nature walk.  No leather boots necessary and just a bit of bush whacking is called for.  The girls can show off their shapely legs in shorts without fear of ticks, spiders, snakes or poisonous plants.  The camp appears to be an abandoned youth camp.  There is a row of sinks in the cottage so I imagined cub scouts with toothbrushes.  Not so scary.  Outside it appears that the landscapers are a week or two behind schedule in cutting the grass. It rises quickly in the rainy season and would be higher than if the neighbors had left for a two week vacation.  Maybe the ghosts had lawn mowers for the grass and heavy shoes to nicely wear down those bald areas.  I guess they forgot to remove that small tree growing through the cabin floor.  The story did hold my interest.  At the opening scene, I picked the sweet girl with the ponytail to be the sole survivor, possibly accompanied by the cute guy with the girlfriend, who was obviously a bit of a vamp and would get killed off.  Nerd guy and rich guy were also obviously ghost fodder and I wasn't too surprised when cute guy was killed off as well.  After that, I hoped that sweet girl would survive instead of making the typical escape only to be plunged back into the nightmare.  I was disappointed when the predictable happened.  When the child appeared in the greenhouse, I thought, geez, did sweet girl kill someone too?  They sure have an interesting archaeology dept. at that college.  How did these sadists all find each other?  I would've liked to have seen an act of redemption followed by an escape- a real escape.  It would have made the story fresher and given it some heart.  All in all, it was true to the horror formula all down the line.  Not a bad evening of entertainment.",1405209600,,2193,4.4335839598997495
8478567,3,B005LTDYH6,"The film opens in 1709 as a group of Native Americans use a sacred/haunted river island as judgement. We see the victims of the murderer perform their judgement. We switch to the future as 5 students want to investigate the area. They obtain a reluctant  guide who won't go near the place, but puts them in the right direction. There was once a family that lived there, who were all killed.

After being warned to leave before sundown, hearing voices,and needing medical attention the students opt to stay the night. Oh yea, it also seems this tribe had its own written language similar to other local tribes. Something else my history book missed.

You know what is going to happen. Students will be judged and haunted by their past sins.

I liked the concept of the film, however the characters were a bit dry. They didn't grab me. They needed stronger characters with better dialogue and sins.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. Brief sex scene. No nudity.",1400803200,,949,4.7272727272727275
8478568,5,B005LTDYH6,"I thought this movie was absolute fantastic.  I loved it.  It was great for a low-budget film.  I wish I could tell the producers and actors, in person, how great they did.  I just loved the movie so much.  I'm glad I bought it.  It shows us that we can never get away with bad things we do.",1331942400,2,291,3.9310344827586206
8478569,3,B005LTDYH6,"Gordon Sullivan, DVD Verdict --The Sacred looks and acts like a typical backwoods slasher. Roughly the first half introduces us to a group of young students as they trek to the remote swamps of Florida in search of Native American artifacts and locations. Because the film opens in the remote past as some Native Americans are mysteriously killed, we know these kids are headed straight to danger. The characters are all pretty stock types, from the rich guy to the shy ""final girl."" Then, about halfway through the film, we discover this isn't just another ""there's a mysterious force in the woods"" movie like The Evil Dead. No, The Sacred is influenced by the recent post-Saw/Cube idea of throwing a bunch of guilty people together to see what happens. That's the ""twist"" that The Sacred throws out halfway through; suddenly we realize this Native American land really was used for judgment, and not of the courthouse variety. The place has a habit of punishing the guilty, and it appears that everybody is guilty of something.

This combo--of the typical backwoods slasher and the ""figure out who's guilty"" flick--is the best thing about The Sacred. After the opening flashback, we're set up to expect trouble for our intrepid band of social scientists. Naturally, we expect that they'll be killed off one by one, but when we learn that they're being menaced because of the sins of their past it gives the film an edge. Then, rather than wondering who's going to be killed next, the audience can spend the last half of the film trying to guess the protagonists' transgressions.

Despite the relative success of its central ""twist,"" The Sacred is not entirely successful as a film. Although I like where the plot ends up, it takes its own sweet time getting there. Aside from the opening kills, there isn't much action for the first 45 minutes. Instead, we get a lot of talk as the characters are introduced and the setting established. This wouldn't be so bad if the characters were the kind we could care about, but for the most part they're generic. That means a good chunk of the film is taken up by things that aren't terribly exciting.

The other major problem with The Sacred--and it was a pretty big problem for Second Coming as well--is the lack of horrifying content. The Sacred feels like it could run on network TV with only a few small cuts. I can understand how a director might want to differentiate his product in the age of so-called ""torture porn"" by relying on old school thrills and chills. That's a commendable goal, but the backwoods slasher is not the go-to genre for that kind of effort. No, when fans put in a film like The Sacred, they want serious gore and maybe a bit of nudity. The Sacred delivers on neither count. The kills, when they come, are pretty good, but they don't happen consistently enough satisfy fans looking for gore.
Despite the film's problems, this DVD is largely satisfying. The 1.78:1 anamorphic transfer is as good-looking as you can expect from a feature of this budget. The director, when not director, is a cinematographer, and it's obvious he pours a lot of attention into the way this film is shot. That attention shows in the loving shots of Florida's landscapes, and the detail in these sequences is pretty impressive. Some of the darker scenes lack detail, but given the budget that's not surprising. No serious compression artifacts mar the feature, and this is probably as good as a low-budget film can be expected to look. The 5.1 surround audio track is a bit of overkill. Though dialogue is clean and clear from the center channel don't expect too much in the way of surround involvement.

Extras start with a commentary featuring Cassella and producer Sharon Reed. The pair discusses the challenges of shooting an indie film in Florida and various technical aspects of its production. A second commentary includes the actors Jessica Blackmore, David Mackey, and Ryan Marsico. Early on someone says it will be less like a commentary and more like an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000--they're absolutely right. The group spends a bit of time talking about the film and its production, but often as not they're sharing little stories about the difficulties in making an indie production. It's a bit slapdash to be consistently interesting, though fans of the film will enjoy some of the stories. We also get a behind-the-scenes featurette that runs 20 minutes, and a blooper reel. A final bonus is the director's short ""Mina.""
