If the end goal is to have a piece of history if you are a fan... where are all the bells and whistles that complete the game??? I want to watch over and over again all those that stated ""The Ohio State Buckeyes couldn't do it... and then at the end I want to watch them all eat their words... How could you deny me or any Buckeye fan the satisfaction of seeing these for the rest of our lives?? That would make it 5 Stars",1425427200,4,486,4.020618556701031
6879689,5,B00QT4VER4,"An unbelievable bargain at less than $15.00 for a blu ray of the game. Great editing and superb picture quality. It was a pleasure not being subjected to the ""talking heads"" at ESPN at halftime. They wisely showed the post game presentation.

6879694,5,B00QT4VER4,"Unbelievable game from an unbelievable season. It could easily have got out of hand when bama was up 21-6. But the buckeyes came storming back. When was the last time a team scored 28 unanswered points on bama in a huge game like this? WITH A THIRD STRING QB NO LESS!! Are you kidding me?? Who out there even knows who your third string QB is? This is unheard of. Anyways, the Defense played out of their minds. The Bucks shut down Amani Cooper (he was 78 yards below his average) and Zeke rolled on bama's defense for a bowl record 230 yards. It was the biggest deficit tOSU came back from since they rallied from 31-0 down to beat Minnesota back in '89. Nick Saban is now 0-3 in the Sugar Bowl. I personally think this game was the biggest game of the year for the Buckeyes. Playing Alabama, the number 1 team... No one seemed to give tOSU a shot. I think they thrive on being the underdog. It seemed all game that bama always thought they were going to win. Even up to the final minutes. I don't think they took tOSU as seriously as they should have. Regardless, the Bucks went in there with a great game plan and executed it extremely well. Minus those two turnovers the Bucks gave up that bama turned into 14 points, this game would not have been as close as it was. I can't wait to watch this game over and over and over. I'll finish this up with one more comment... Hey SEC/bama, the BIG 10/tOSU BEAT YOU WITH A THIRD STRING QB. Hahahaha, I love it.",1424217600,22,1456,4.241007194244604

6879718,5,B00QT4VER4,"As an Ohio State fan, this is a treasure to ""relive"" this game whenever you want on this DVD as OSU works their way to the National Championship.  The season started terribly as their Heisman finalist Miller went down weeks before the season started; then their Freshman second string Quarterback Barrett aptly lead OSU (setting school records) through the season, only the break his foot in the final game of the season.  Ohio State's third string quarterback Jones then proceeded to lead Ohio to the Big Ten Championship, a victory over powerhouse Alabama, and a National Championship win over Oregon!  It was a great season!  The Allstate Sugar Bowl win over mighty Alabama was especially meaningful with all the trash talk about the Big Ten being too big and no match for the SEC.  Alabama is a great team; Ohio State with its 3rd string quarterback is pretty impressive too.",1434326400,,879,4.833333333333333

6879773,3,B00QT4VER4,"Okay, was anyone able to view the second disc?  Either on the playoff OR the championship game, I was unable to view the 2nd of 2 discs.  Regardless, both were great games (as a Buckeye fan, of course.)  I do think the commentators tend to gush over the SEC.  One of many examples would be an Alabama player gaining 5 yards and there were 4 replays of it.  A great defensive or offensive play by OSU rarely warranted even a single replay.  The commentators bias is not the fault of the producers of the DVD, though the editing was.  Also, where was the closed captioning?  A playoff Sugar Bowl and no CC??  Heck, even Ernst goes to Jail gets CC.

Still, I gave it three stars as the video quality was pretty good - as it should be with Blu-ray, but the editing and lack of CC was just not excusable.  (Yeah, some of us have difficulty hearing).  The blank ""extra"" DVD was puzzling as well.  I thought there might be more interviews or analysis from ESPN staff.

The ever-so, all-mighty, invincible Crimson Tide was given a quick and decisive knockout by the super underdog, over rated, over publicized Buckeyes! A Buckeye team in which it's number 1 quarterback had been sidelined all year, and the number 2 quarterback sidelined in the final season game with Michigan. Starting, for only the second time in his career, a THIRD string quarterback!!! Are you kidding me? This was not even suppose to BE a game. Bama was already declared the winner, just had to go through the motions. This game is on a level with the Tyson-Douglas fight. There was no way in HELL the Buckeyes were even given a chance. You could hear it in the announcers voices before the game and then as it progressed. (sure, they had to sell the game so people would watch and they could sell advertising space), but they did not have their heart into it. When the Bucks started scoring, and Alabama could do nothing to stop them, you can see the exasperation on their faces... 'who are these guys? They aren't the team everyone's been talking about...they're legit!' Too legit to quit! The Tide tried to keep up with them, but the Buckeyes had a counter blow to every shot taken by them. It was The Most Satisfying Win in Buckeye Football History, (imho). Even more so than the championship game the next week, (We knew we could beat Oregon, now there's an over rated team). Even sweeter than the championship win over Miami. (that was much closer, and the Buckeyes did not Dominate the Canes like they did Bama). An Absolute MUST Blu-ray for anyone calling themselves a Buckeye fan. Something to be enjoyed forever, re visit the feeling!!!",1465689600,,1803,4.655172413793103
