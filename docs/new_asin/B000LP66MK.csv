2711251,5,B000LP66MK,I now have all 3 of Di Van Niekerk ribbon embroidery DVDs. They're great. Excellent way to learn to do beautiful ribbon stitches.,1379721600,,129,4.6521739130434785
2711252,5,B000LP66MK,I follow Di van Niekerk's blog. I chose this for the variety of flowers so I could learn and practice them while creating a sampler.  Not disappointed at all.,1365465600,,158,4.448275862068965
2711253,5,B000LP66MK,"love this ribbon embroidery and stumpwork workshop ,would advice any one wanting to do ribbon embroidery and stumpwork to purchase this book",1361577600,,140,5.409090909090909
2711254,5,B000LP66MK,"This product is well crafted and informative. The instructions are for embroidery using ribbons and embroidery threads. It gives clear and easy to understand instruction for anyone interested in stump work as well as embroidery. The author gives concise demos of many important stitches that are highly detailed. It is a relaxing and pleasant product to watch. The materials are presented in a relaxed way. It shows what beautiful things can be made through embroidery and stump work. There were no written instructions or patterns to trace in the product jacket, that was supposed to be in there, as the author said in the DVD. This would be important if you need to trace the patterns shown in the DVD.

The product comes with two DVDs, oddly they each are numbered as volumn 1. Nevertheless, each disc is different. One is a demo of the stitches in forming the actual work, and the other are demos of each single stitch used in the demos. You will easily learn this craft as Ms  Niekerk, is an excellent instructor. You will enjoy embellishing work of your own, with flowers that look real, and beautiful. She demos roses, and other flowers, birds, bees etc.  You will be very pleased with how easy it is to learn and do this craft. She has free downloads on her web site. She also has a beginners kit available. There was no problem with delivery. I would recommend using notice by mobile phone to alert that delivery is on the way or completed. There was no problem with delivery, I received the product a few days earlier than stated on the order.",1340928000,4,1553,4.64
2711255,4,B000LP66MK,"I agree with all the other positive reviews already posted here.  The one problem I had with this DVD series is that the description states that the focus of all the lessons is on ribbon embroidery and stumpwork however, approx. half of all the stitches taught on the first two DVD's were basic embroidery stitches that did not involve the use of ribbon at all. If like myself, you are only interested in ribbon embroidery, the third in the series seems to offer the most lessons on actual ribbon embroidery. Also, as someone who bought all three at once, the production quality of the last video was the best. I also thought all the information on all three DVD's could have easily been made available on one DVD.",1303689600,20,714,4.578125
2711256,5,B000LP66MK,"Here in America we tend to busy ourselves with our own talented silk ribbon embroidery goddesses and forget to raise our eyes to the horizon.  But in doing so, we're missing a world of beautiful designs and wonderful teachers.  This set of DVDs and its accompanying book from the hands of South Africa's revered embroideress and teacher, Di Van Niekirk, is a prime example.

The brief descriptions of these products you see here don't do justice to these products, and I urge you to go to YouTube where you'll find excerpts from these DVDs available for viewing.  It was there, viewing the ""Iris stitch"" clip, specifically, that my eyes were opened to the quality of the images and the instruction on these DVDs which sent me in search of them and ultimately brought me to Amazon.  Don't take my word for it!  Go and see for yourself, and be similarly dazzled.

Here's a link directly to the ""Iris stitch,"" (from the second DVD in the collection) but there are others as well.  Do a search for Di Van Niekirk to see the entire wondrous array.

2711257,4,B000LP66MK,"The DVD is great. However, the pattern was missing. Returned the DVD and got another one. Pattern still missing. E-mailed Di van Niekerk and she sent me one pdf. and told me the enlargement. She also told me she would mail me one if I could not open the pdf.file. Fast and great response!",1223251200,14,288,4.351851851851852
2711258,4,B000LP66MK,"This is a great DVD; it explains the stitches in an easy to understand manner & the filming is 1st class. It has great close ups of the stitching methods and numerous hints & tips.
The DVD is beautiful to listen to and has lovely gentle music in the background.
I was very disappointed to find it didn't come with the traceable pattern sheet & the list of requirements although it clearly states on the cover that these are included.",1188518400,20,433,4.425
2711259,5,B000LP66MK,"The organization of the cd is very clear, allowing you to go to the exact stitch you want to see demonstrated.  The video quality is excellent, allowing you to see exactly how the hands are positioned.  The vocal quality is good and the directions are precise and always to the point.  The supplies needed are clearly listed so you can have them at the ready ahead of time.  I could find no aspect of the CD that wasn't helpful and of excellent quality.  I would recommend this to anyone interested in embroidery, beginner or otherwise!",1175299200,31,536,4.6
2711260,5,B000LP66MK,I received the DVD for Christmas. I had been waiting for it to arrive at Amazon because the ones on Di's website are not compatable with American DVD players. It was worth the wait. The lessons are clear - and beautifully demonstrated. In this day and age when it is difficult to find needlework teachers this is really an awesome tool. I am learning so much. I think Di van Neikerk is one the best stitch artists around. My DVD did not come with the printable pattern but when I emailed them they were very gracious and emailed me a pdf right away. Treat yourself-- this is first rate!,1168300800,49,586,4.385321100917431

8162682,3,B000LP66MK,"I have not started the actual embroidery but so far I am disappointed that there is nothing inside the cover of the DVD that it refers to.  No order blank etc.  Several of the reviews that I read talked about the book that came with the DVD, I received no book. All in all I am not very happy.",1435104000,,293,3.9491525423728815

8162686,5,B000LP66MK,"I hope this type of embroidery never disappears.  It's beautiful and with practice, simple and then you are on your way to beautifying something with your skill.",1391817600,,161,4.962962962962963
8162687,5,B000LP66MK,"I'm new to stumpwork and SRE (silk ribbon embroidery) and I find this DVD to be excellent. The camera work and sound is exemplary, as is Di's teaching. I've gotten embroidery and crazy quilt DVDs from other authors and so often I couldn't see the stitch being done (rather pointless!) because the embroiderer's hands were in the way. Not so here.

The ONLY thing I will warn about is that I feel Amazon does a disservice by not explaining in their description that the pattern on the cover of the DVD and which Di refers to in the DVD is NOT included when you buy it from Amazon.  However, this is very easily remedied as Di will send you the pattern free by e-mail. Or do like I did and buy the panel itself directly from her. If you aren't in South Africa don't let the distance scare you. The pattern is gorgeously done (hand painted) and very inexpensive at only R149 which is $14.15 in US Dollars. To save you some time looking for it (her website is jam packed with goodies) go to the search bar and put ""RES Panel"" and you'll find it on page 15 of 35 pages of panels. Postage isn't high and it's quick too.

The other thing you can do is buy the book here at Amazon. It has the pattern in both color and b/w that you can copy and print directly onto your own fabric or trace. The book explains in detail how to go about it, and how to do all the stitches as well.

Di and Renn (her sister-in-law) are both VERY helpful and answers all questions so thoroughly I don't know how they have time to run a business.",1388188800,3,1516,4.1993127147766325
