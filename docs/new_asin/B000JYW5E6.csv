2680841,5,B000JYW5E6,"'Loneliness..."" is a period piece centered in England in the 1960s as it sank further into socialism with its attendant lethargy, pessimism and class resentment. Courtenay is brilliant as young man without a future despite his obvious intelligence and his instinctive sense that a better life is out there, if only....

The jazz score is thrilling. The theme played during Courtenay's training runs is original to the movie by John Addison, and should be available somewhere (but it isn't). It's magical.

As a movie about running, it's misplayed. Courtenay gets it right about why runners run: because it's a selfish act of individual triumph, and for the vast majority of runners, winning a race isn't important, as Courtenay dramatizes with frustrating accuracy. But Courtenay's running style is like a sack of watch parts trying to reassemble themselves. His arms are flailing, head is wobbling, hips are rotating.",1387497600,,918,5.238095238095238

2680847,5,B000JYW5E6,This is one of my favorite running movies. It's one of those angry young men movies. It's really a story about rebellion and refusal to submit to authority.

A good movie to add to your running collection for any runner out there.,1354579200,,347,4.3538461538461535

2680849,5,B000JYW5E6,"Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner (1962) Stuck To The Truth, Which Is What The Best Art Always Does.

The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner (1962 English) starring Tom Courtenay, Sir Michael Redgrave, written by Alan Sillitoe, and directed by Tony Richardson is one of the very best movies ever made.

It is a ""coming of age"" story of a young and immature high school aged boy played well by Tom Courtenay (who won the BAFTA ""Most Promising New Actor"" award for his role) who is sent to a ""progressive"" English reform school (part of the infamous ""Borstal School"" system in greater London, England) and allowed unusual freedom there by the prison warden/ ""headmaster"" (wanna be) portrayed by Sir Michael Redgrave.

Courtenay is a gifted athlete who excels at long distance running, the prison warden/ ""headmaster"" Redgrave arranges for an English public school (private boarding school for rich boys) to compete against the reform school in athletics with a special trophy given for the winner of a long distance running match which highlights the meet.

Courtenay agrees to prepare for the athletic match, follows all the rules, appears to be a cooperative inmate headed for reform, but when the day of the athletic meet comes and the race is run he is supposed to win, intentionally allows his public school (private schools in England are called ""public schools"") competitor runner to beat him so the trophy the prison warden/ ""headmaster"" Redgrave lusts for does not come to the ""progressive"" reform school (actually a prison for teen aged convicted delinquent boys).

The story is based on a short story written by the famous English writer from the 1950's named Alan Sillitoe who described the lives and oppressions of working class people in post WWII England, and portrayed the opposition of ""have nots"" against the ""haves,"" and particularly against the various law enforcement and government henchmen working to support the upper classes and keep the lower classes in their place.

The theme of ""angry young men"" during the 1950's in England was widely used in English drama and literature, and the possibility that young, strong, vigorous males in the lower classes might rise up and lead a successful revolt against the privileged and oppressive upper classes was suggested by ""angry young men"" stories such as The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner (1962) starring Tom Courtenay, Saturday Night And Sunday Morning (1960) starring Albert Finney, and even in a glamorized full color spectacle movie version of Henry Fielding's famous Tom Jones (1963) story starring Albert Finney and directed by Tony Richardson (who also directed ""Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner"").

People in the early 1960's were hopeful that true socialism might replace the brutal capitalistic system which dominated the ""free world"" of those times in England, other parts of Europe, and eventually, the USA, and the tumult of the 1960's reflected how widespread and supported these hopes were.

But the revolt of the 1960's and 1970's failed miserably, and socialistic moves which were put in place during the 1930's and 1940's in England (which got universal socialized health care medicine free to all citizens) and the USA (which got the New Deal and the War On Poverty, briefly) were systematically and carefully undone by the likes of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan in the 1980's, both agreed that ""free enterprise"" was the answer to social problems and needs, and that socialism was a disease to be fought and conquered and vanquished.

2680850,5,B000JYW5E6,"Tom Courtenay as Colin in the lead role is excellent. Alan Stillitoe's novel of the 1960s borstal boy is a classic and the film does the book justice. It is not comfortable watching. If you were a lad in Britain in those times and coming of age in a working class community disintegrating under the new wealth, new identity (its where being a teenager had its roots-self identity kicking out against old people-our parents) then this resonates. I saw the double standards of kids from my neck of the woods being sent down while richer kids were sent abroad or nod, nod, wink, wink to magistrates to know it was and still is a weighted system if you are not born of the right class of parents. And then there is the added insult for all of us ever forced to endure that event-cross country running. Yeah, like Colin, it was often time to switch out of the dirge of daily life and be on your own but it was also often frigging cold, and try running five miles with more mud on your plimsolls than Southend with the tide out. Yes, this film certainly had the memory bank ticking over. A good film but not one for sixties ""Wasn't Britain luverly then"" nostalgia freaks or those who like to feel inspired with heartfelt joy of being alive. But if you like a bit of grit along memory lane then this does the trick and then some. Now where are those plimsolls...",1347926400,,1355,4.380952380952381
2680851,3,B000JYW5E6,"I love to run. I especially like to run long distances. I also watch lots of movies.  I had heard of this movie title, and think of it frequently when I am out on a long distance run. I usually don't feel particularly lonely. Alone, but in good way. I like this title because I like the loneliness/solitude/aloneness of the long distance run.

Unfortunately, I like the title of the movie much more than I like the movie itself. Originally released in 1962, the style reflects the times. There is some quality acting, to be sure, but the editing drove me crazy. Flashbacks can, of course, be very effective in films, but here they were just jarring.

The long distance runner in question, caught in a petty burglary, gets shipped off to a reform school which looks more like a private prep school than juvenille hall. The teachers notice his speed during a soccer match and recruit him to run the distance race against a neighboring prep school. As part of his training, they entrust him with the freedom to leave the grounds and run through the countryside. The movie flashes back to the events that landed him in reform school and culminates in the big meet with the other school. I won't tell you who won.

Like I said, I didn't like the style of the movie, and am not too fond of the story, and was pretty disappointed in the ending. But one thing I LOVED about the movie: the long distance running itself. When Colin leaves the school gates and runs through the fields, his joyful running inspired me. Leaping and bounding like a deer, or, more simply, like a child at play, he runs and runs.

Oftentimes, this joy and abandonment is missing during my runs. I tend to have a goal time and pace, a pre-set schedule for the day's run, and a focus on my GPS. I want to meet certain goals, but I also want to capture that joy of running that Colin displays. It's the same kind of attitude that Christopher McDougall conveys in his book Born to Run. His accounts of the running of both the Tarahumara Indians of northern Mexico and American ultrarunners beautifully convey running for the love of running.

Bottom line, for the movie alone, I'll give the movie 2 stars.
But for some running inspiration, it earns 4 stars.",1343779200,,2221,4.512437810945274
2680852,5,B000JYW5E6,"This review follows my Looking Forward, Mainly (on Karel Reisz' Saturday night and Sunday morning) which I discussed on 8 August 2011. Like that movie, it has been reworked digitally, and like that dvd, we get a free bonus: Momma don't allow, a short British documentary about a north London jazz club made in 1955, co-directed by Karel Reisz and Tony Richardson and filmed by Walter Lassally. I also finally got hold of one of the few books documenting all this well, so the promised book review on British Free Cinema is in my pipeline.

Michael Redgrave (as governor), Tom Courtenay, and in a relatively marginal, though key appearance James Fox (later in The Servant by Losey) play in a relatively banal story about rebellious delinquent youths in a Northern industrial city. Written by later famous Alan Sillitoe (1928-2010), an English writer and one of the ""Angry Young Men"" of the 1950s; he, by the way, disliked it, as did most of the other writers to whom it was applied, though his family background and life as factory worker clearly qualify him for the label. Camera by equally famous Walter Lassally (I recommend a quick browse on both).

Tom Courtenay is put up by the ambitious School Governor to compete with a public school top runner, James Fox. He is about to win the race, but very shortly before the end he literally comes to a slow motion halt - he realizes that he is being used again, and that this means further domination by the class he hates - governors, the police, (re-)educators and the whole unlovable society. Lassally's camerawork is unbeatable, differentiated black and white. Why there were only few films of the caliber of Reisz and Richardson, and not a whole wave like in the French Nouvelle Vague, will, as said already, be a separate review topic.",1316736000,,1789,4.767741935483871

2680854,5,B000JYW5E6,"The ultimate classic about a young man in an all male English school who gains success as a great distance runner who in spite of his success has conflicts that results in the astonishing ending, shocking  his teachers with his personal revolt.

2680855,4,B000JYW5E6,"This was a fascinating novel I read over 30 years ago.  Seeing that it had been made into a movie, I bought it.  I wasn't disappointed. Although a lot of time is spent documenting the runner's social/economic conditions, it ultimately makes sense in the context of the ending.  I particularly liked the way the story shows the raw underbelly of poverty/social stigma (in England) and how people deal with it.  From gleefully spending a loved ones insurance money, to stealing a car for fun, the story pulls no punches.  It becomes easy to identify with the protagonist.  The movie never veers from the novel in any significant way. It is all too clear why the runner does what he does at the end, despite knowing exactly what will result for him. I found the acting and filming superb.",1286668800,,785,4.6521739130434785
2680856,4,B000JYW5E6,"A bleak but very powerful movie, a product of its time in post WWII Britain, with old certainties falling apart, but the swinging sixties not yet arrived.

Tom Courtenay plays Colin, a thoughtful, wary young man recently sent to a borstal (young person's prison). He is resigned to his lot, that of the underdog, always running from, and fighting with, authority. As shown in extended scenes from his earlier home life, his family life is grim (his family live in poverty in the shadow of the factory where his dying father has worked for his whole life). Colin sees no hope of any permanent escape from this life. There are two things that offer glimpses of alternatives; one is the freedom he feels while running long, meandering races through the countryside--he sheds his hunted-animal-look and smiles openly and honestly. Secondly, brief snatches of fun, joyriding in stolen cars and taking girlfriends to sleazy seaside hotels, offer glimpses of other possibilities. But his closest ties are with his father, who, on his deathbed, defiantly refuses medicine and hospital treatment--he wants no help, no charity, from anyone. As the movie progresses, Colin turns into a fast and talented long-distance runner and is given an opportunity to use these skills to--dare we say it?--better himself. In a gripping finale, racing with a running-star public-schoolboy character (played by a very young James Fox), he is shown making a difficult, shocking decision.",1286323200,,1461,5.1645569620253164
2680857,5,B000JYW5E6,"Alan Sillitoe described once having been offered a cottage in Harsfordshire by a friend: ""I was sitting in a sort of parlor there one day, writing. And suddenly I saw someone run past the window, along the lane outside. With shorts on, white shirt and so on. And it seemed to me such an unusual image that I wrote down at the top of a sheet of paper, `The loneliness of the long-distance runner.' I didn't know where he had come from. I didn't know where he was going. He was simply a sort of vision, floating by the window. And I put the line away. I thought I was going to write a poem with this sort of line in it. It seemed rather a nice line.""

  Instead of writing a poem, Sillitoe wrote a short story with the ""nice line"" as title. The line also served as title for a book collecting that and nine other short stories, published in 1958. Along with a novel titled Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, this launched his career as one of the decade's ""Angry Young Men,"" a radical who championed the British working class. In many respects, The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner is less about running and more about the pervasive effects of poverty.

  Several years later, Sillitoe wrote the screenplay made into a film starring Tom Courtenay as Colin Smith, a robber turned runner. The director of Loneliness was Tony Richardson, who in 1964 would win two Oscars (Best Picture and Best Director) for Tom Jones.

  Loneliness was black and white, a ""foreign"" film whose characters spoke in working-class accents not easy on American ears. You almost need sub-titles to understand what the characters are saying; except none are available on the version of this film still available on Amazon.com and Netflix. Given the film's half-century age, few runners today have seen it and, certainly, even fewer have read the short story from which it sprang. Ask anyone about Loneliness and most often they refer to it as a ""book,"" which it is not. They know the title, but misunderstand the meaning of that title. Was the long-distance runner portrayed by Sillitoe, really ""lonely"" with all the negative connotations associated with that word?

  View this film and find out. As a contributing editor for Runner's World and author of 35 books (not all of them about running), I consider this the best film about long-distance running every made. It captures our sport as no film has before or since.

2680858,4,B000JYW5E6,"A prophetic forecast of what lay ahead in the 60s.  Made in 1962 still years before the hippie revolution in America or Timothy Leary's call to 'turn on, tune in & drop out', this movie really is as the Amazon review puts it ""one man's struggle to determine who he is"" and/or rather - who he is not. It's a bleak film, not any lighter for being in black and white.  It's more statement than entertainment and seems to take a while in reaching its conclusion. After seeing it and allowing it to settle though, I can see its importance in relation to history and the times. This movie could be seen as kind of a milestone in western society's evolution from the 50s and lets you marvel at the dawn of the 60s, an era whose influence on culture has had a lot to do with the shaping of modern attitudes in the west to this day.  I don't think that's reading too much into it.  As far as entertainment goes, it's not what you'd call a riveting ride though it is well-filmed and well-acted.  The DVD has subtitles which helped keep me up with the British 60s English in places.  There's a trailer as well but no real special features.  In 1962 this movie may have been ahead of its time.  With ""the establishment"" on one side and jail on the other, I can't say I fully agreed with his choice, but it does say something about our power to choose whose games we're going to play and that we do have a choice. Of course choices have consequences too.  Don't suppose what happened afterward would have made for an interesting sequel..  maybe it would have.",1282003200,,1546,4.336805555555555
2680859,5,B000JYW5E6,"""The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner"" (1962), a black and white British, sports oriented drama, was based on Alan Sillitoe's semi-autobiographical novel about a rebellious 18-year-old living in dreary Nottingham, Nottinghamshire.  The writer, also the author of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saturday-Night-and-Sunday-Morning-Vintage-International/dp/0307389650/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (Vintage International)</a>, who was then one of the foremost practitioners of the school of English writing known as ""the angry young men,"" that was so influential at the time, wrote the screenplay.

Tom Courtenay, of the harshly chiseled face, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dresser/dp/B0001BRSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dresser</a>) made a stunning debut - it's hard to even tell he's acting -- as Colin Smith, the long-distance runner of the title, a cynical young man determined to fight the system at every turn.  He has no interest in school or in the no-future factory job awaiting him, so he turns to a life of petty crime alongside his friend Mike, played by a very young James Bolam (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Beiderbecke-Tapes/dp/B001V7YZEI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Beiderbecke Tapes</a>). A botched robbery of a local bakery lands the two in Ruxton Towers, a reform school - they were then known as Borstals. The Governor, the top school official, played by Sir Michael Redgrave,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Importance-of-Being-Earnest-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00006673M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Importance of Being Earnest - Criterion Collection</a>, who was to be Richardson's real-life father-in-law, believes in the rehabilitative value of physical training.  He sees Colin's hidden talent as a runner and arranges a day of track events against a nearby, prestigious public school (that'd be a private school to Americans.)  Colin, a conflicted and bitter young man, must decide whether to nurture his ability or once again rebel against authority.

Avis Brunnage, who'd played so many similar parts, does good work as Colin's etched in acid mother.  A number of  to-be-successful British actors  show up in smaller parts: Alec Mc Cowen as Brown, Colin's headmaster; Frank Finlay as a railway booking office clerk.  A very young John Thaw (that'd be Inspector Morse, or Kavanaugh QC to you) shows up as Bosworth, another of the Borstal inmates.  A young woman with the unlikely name of Topsy Jane debuts as Audrey, Colin's girlfriend: she was slated to play with Courtenay again in the soon-to-be filmed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Billy-Liar-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00005EBSB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Billy Liar - Criterion Collection</a>, but apparently had a nervous breakdown shortly before filming began.  The young Julie Christie stepped into the part, and we know what happened there.  A similarly young James Fox, with Edward, one of those greatly talented identical Fox twins, James being the brother who gave up acting for the contemplative life of a religious, gives us one of his earliest impressions of an upper-class twit as No. 7, Gunthorpe, the public school's best runner: the climactic race of the day is going to come down to a duel between him, and Colin's No. 14.

Better use has probably never been made of  the anthem ""Jerusalem"" that comments upon the Great Britain of the time: the utter sense of futility felt by the lower classes; the gritty cityscape, the gray, cold, damp and desolate look of the U.K. in winter.  The film shows us the oppression of Colin's home life and his imprisonment, and the freedom he feels when running.  The movie obviously falls among the contemporary angry young man school of film-making:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saturday-Night-and-Sunday-Morning/dp/B00005S8KV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saturday Night and Sunday Morning</a>;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/This-Sporting-Life-Criterion-Collection/dp/B000XPSC16/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">This Sporting Life - Criterion Collection</a>:<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Room-at-the-Top/dp/B00002VW6M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Room at the Top</a>. It makes good use of jump cuts and lengthy flashbacks,  ideas then rather new to UK filmmakers that were borrowed from the contemporaneous French ""nouvelle vogue"" directors.  The film was, in fact, influential in the early 60's, although it is now underrated and little known.  It has, undoubtedly, dated a bit, but it is still powerful, gripping, arresting: you can supply your own favorite adjectives when you see it.",1276646400,,5111,6.856481481481482

2680863,4,B000JYW5E6,"This is the fully restored British Film Institute version of Tony Richardson's 1962 classic - and it's beautifully done - clean from start to finish. Even as the credits roll - it's spotless - a truly fantastic restoration job.

Because the clean up is so good it also pummels home the austerity of post-war England in almost every scene, while the black & white film stock and the hand-held camera work only add to its gritty and downbeat feel. We also get to properly see the intensity of Tom Courtney's extraordinary performance - all working class defiance and mind games. Another noticeable improvement is the music. The brass band stuff that accompanies every running shot is very punchy now - its either military or patriotic - or both.  It acts as a sort of sneering backdrop, like ""If..."" almost...

The internal Borstal scenes are well done, as is Tom's appallingly claustrophobic home life - all that family repression and rage building up to his final racing sabotage. There are also many famous faces in there - John Thaw, James Bolam, Michael Redgrave - even a cameo by Edward Fox as runner number 7 towards the end. Having said all of that, it's not a film you warm to easily - it wouldn't be everyone's cup of tea to sit down to this unrelenting feast of ""it's grim up north...""

The extras are interesting too. First there's a commentary on the movie (On or Off whichever you want), second is a sort of ""making of"" named after the principal cameraman ""Walter Lasally Video Essay"" in which he explains why certain shots were filmed in certain ways. He also references other Richardson work. Also you get to see the original stock footage of the opening credits BEFORE the restoration - it's covered in lines and smudges - so when you do to see the actual movie, you realise what a huge amount of work was put into this.

Number 3 is a curio that jazz buffs will love - it's Tony Anderson's ""Momma Don't Allow"" - a short film made about ordinary British workers ending up in a jazz club. It was filmed in the gloriously named ""Art & Viv's Sander's Wood Green Jazz Club in The Fishmonger's Arms"". It features The Chris Barber Jazz Band - Pat Halcox, Ron Bowden, Lonnie Donegan, Jim Bray and Ollie Paterson. It's really badly scratched and decayed, but the soundtrack is very good - and I guess it's a miracle that it's survived at all.

The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner wouldn't be everyone's first choice for a cheery Sunday afternoon watch - but for those who do love this bitterly repressed yet still relevant film - they will adore how beautifully the BFI have restored it.

Recommended.

PS: the BFI have also done ""Saturday Night Sunday Morning"" with Albert Finney - a mouth-watering prospect - and their work on Stanley's Baker's ""Zulu"" is off the charts - simply has to be seen to be believed...",1240444800,,2827,4.617529880478088

The wonderful Tom Courtenay plays the title character, Colin Smith, a working class kid whose life is up the junction & then some. Following a string of petty crimes, Colin is thrown in the clink - British reform school - only to have the penitentiary wankers coddle him, as they are banking on Colin's athletic prowess to win a cross country race against a prestigious school. However, our noble laddie has different plans altogether:

""I'm going to let them think they have me house trained, but they never will, the [...]. To get me beat they'll have to stick a rope around my neck.""

2680865,5,B000JYW5E6,"Tony Richardson and Allan Sillitoe have combined again for another great movie about the British working class.  The trouble with this and other such movies about this subject is the emptiness it conveys.  Growing up in America is decidedly different although there will be many who would  dispute that.  However, what comes across clearly in movies such as this, ""Saturday Night and Sunday Morning"", ""Look Back in Anger"" and others is that there is no hope for the young working class to raise their status.  It's the factory line or the unemployment line and the disdain of those who seek more out of life is its' own punishment.  The case of Tom Courtney's character is an example of a young man with little options.  He eventually discovers (as did the Richard Harris character in ""This Sporting Life"") that success in sports (at least in the 1960's) did not provide a bridge to crossover.  The movie ends intentionally akwardly as our anti-hero realizes the futility of efforts.  Along the way, we are treated to an outstanding combination of writing, acting, directing, and film editing.  This is a classic movie of its' genre but it is a genre that leaves one empty.

One note about the music; I recognized the tune that kept appearing in the film.  I eventually connected it to a haunting piece that I had heard before in ""Chariots of Fire"" (talk about the opposite side of the tracks!).  No, it wasn't THE tune from ""Chariots"" but I tried to find the title to the tune which emerged vocally as the reform school's song but was unable to with the limited credits.  I wondered whether or not the producers of ""Chariots of Fire"" put that tune in their movie as a tribute to ""The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner"".",1198627200,,1725,4.687707641196013
2680866,4,B000JYW5E6,"Tony Richardson is today a relatively neglected director but back in the 1960's was responsible for as many good and important British movies as anyone else in UK cinema-as per Tom Jones ,A Taste of Honey ,The Entertainer ,The Charge of the Light Brigade .This is for me his key work and is a superior example of the ""angry young man""movement in movies .

Tom Courtenay plays Colin Smith, a poorly educated youth  sent to Borstal - a sort of British youth reformatory -for robbing a baker's shop. The Governor of the institution (played by Michael Redgrave )believes in the rehabilitative powers of sport ,believing it builds character and is quick to notice Smith,with a whippet like physique and reserves of stamina  , possesses considerable ability as a cross country runner .He encourages this and in particular his participation in the annual cross country competition with a prestigious private school for the sons of the priviliged in the area. He promises Smith special privileges if he competes in  and wins the race .Smith agrees and the movie than traces his training regime and folows him on his runs across the land around the Borstal -there is some striking monochrome photography of the countryside here .During these runs Smith reflects on his life and we are given flashback sequences tracing the influences on Smith that have lead him to this point in his life .

On the day of the race he easily outclasses the competitors from the rival team -including a pre-stardom James Fox-and produces a startling act of defiance against ""the system"" -his revenge if you like against the forces he beleieves  have brought him to this point .

Tom Courtenay announced himself as a major actor with this movie and if Redgrave is less impactful it is only because the audience expects great things from this consumate actor ;they are two fine actors giving outstanding performances,
The stark photography of Walter Lasally adds much to the movie as does the adaptation of his own short story by Alan Sillitoe

I do not share Mr Sillitoe's belief that criminals are victims of any ""system"" but even so I do applaud this powerful and still pertinent movie",1197504000,,2158,4.861035422343324
2680867,5,B000JYW5E6,"The British New Wave which was inspired by the location work, documentary style and class concerns of the Free Cinema movement was very much the dour, dreary and depressing side of British cinema in the 1960's. British cinema however finally began to express itself with a uniquely national tone not seen since the documentary movement of the 1930's. Whilst Hammer provided the colour, glamour and unbridled sexual passions of the day, the productions of Bryantston, Woodfall et al were furious indictments of social inequality. These films were many, but the canon generally now consists of recognised classics such as ""Saturday Night, Sunday Morning"", ""A Taste of Honey"" and ""This Sporting Life."" For me ""The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner"" remains the pinnacle of this movement. It is a dismal story of  escape, alienation, consumerism, capitalism, tradition and conformity. But director Tony Richardson isn't afraid to lighten things up, usually by speeding up the action. Although we empathise with the plight of the central character, we join him at the films conclusion in a moment of victory, perhaps the only one he will ever experience. Whilst our mind wills Colin to win the final race, a race which has all sorts of metaphorical and symbolic value due to it being a competition against public schoolboys, out heart wills Colin to refuse the road of conformity and tradition. Colin ultimately doesn't let us down, unlike the system that has produced him. This film is beautifully shot, with pitch perfect performances, and a soundtrack which contains a particularly ironic rendition of ""Jerusalem"". Lindsey Anderson would take the lesson of this film to its logical, revolutionary and bloody conclusion in ""If"" a few years later, but ""If"" lacks the humanity, heart and subtle touch of this film.",1187049600,,1814,5.170068027210885

Richardson builds tension by cutting between the restrictions and tensions of reform-school life and Colin's recollection of events leading up to his arrest and detention.

2680869,5,B000JYW5E6,"Tony Richardson's ""The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner"" requires a lot from the viewer because it paints a pretty bleak picture of Britain in the early Sixties.  Young Colin Smith(Tom Courtenay) is angry and rightly so.  His father has died and his employer gives the family a pittance for his life's work.  Mum indiscrimently wastes the money on silly things.  Before Dad's body is cold Mum has already moved a male lover into the house.  Society offers Colin little hope outside of mandatory conscription into the military or a dead-end factory job that probably bought his father an early grave.  How does Colin lash out?  A few wreckless acts like pinching an auto or breaking into a bakery and stealing a cash box.  The last act lands Colin in reform school.  At least there Colin can hope for some equity.  No, not really because there's a pecking order there that usually depends on athletic prowess.  So Colin takes up long distance running.  Why does Colin run?  Only he knows for sure and he's not telling.  Courtenay is absolutely brilliant in a role that requires him to emote very little but convey the anger that seethes beneath the surface.  Richardson expertly handles the different story threads here.  The narrative requires him to go back and forth in time and the film is edited brilliantly.  It's easy to lump this film with the other ""angry young man"" films that emerged from that time but ""The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner"" stands the test of time.",1181433600,,1488,4.772549019607843

2680873,5,B000JYW5E6,""" The loneliness of the long-distance runner "" is a honest expresionist portrait of british working class. Director Tony Richardson developed a short-story by Alan Sillitoe,who collaborates as scripwriter in the film, for what's probably the movie that synthesizes better than any other the subversive spirit of Free Cinema, a cinematographic social phenomenon that joined a group of angry young men revolted against the narrow borders of a manipulative and hygienic industry interested in keeping under latch the miseries and contradictions of british establishment. The film condenses wonderfully almost everything of the innovations and social worries that have converted Free Cinema in the most important experience of british cinematography: the use of documentary film tecniques following the example of Humphrey Jannings' movies and the documentary school of John Grierson; independent production; antiestablisment criticism;antiacademic performances;the rebound of glamour and stylism; the use of montage strategies inspired in political russian cinematographers and innovative technologies as portable cameras; and the interest in reflecting underground social subjects.

Colin Smith(Tom Courtenay)is an intelligent and desillusioned teenager who has been sent to a reform school for youths from the low step of the british class pyramid due to a petty robbery in a bakery. Soon the reformatory governor ( Michael Redgrave ),obssesed in discipline and sports and in winning a cross country running competition against a local private school, ingratiates with him once he has could evaluate Colin's excellent background  as long-distance  runner, circumstance that supposes for him the favour of the reformatory governor and a excellent chance of getting a fast ""freedom"". During his ""privileged"" solitary runs outside the reformatory Colin reminds his life just before his incarceration, balancing his paradoxal situation. In the following lines I describe what I think are three representative moments of the combative ideology of the film and the "" fresh "" spirit of Free Cinema:the scene when the inmates revolts against their superiors in the reformatory's dinning-room for which Tony Richardson uses wisely montage tecniques learned of  vanguardist russian directors as Eisenstein or Dovzhenko;the ironic portrait of the ""society of comfort"" where we see Colin's family spending the money of the insurance in a succcession of vignettes preceded by ""advertising curtains"" and enclosed with a sardonic music and,finally, the brilliant parallel-action montage where we see the inmates singing a patriotic song in the chapel of the reformatory while at the same moment in a looser cell of the building  the inmate who had got to runaway days before is wildly punished. Another of the much achievements of this extraordinary film is the expressionist use of jazz music in the sequences of the solitary runs of Colin outside the reformatory gates.

2680874,5,B000JYW5E6,"This was the story later used in the American film with Burt Reynolds, The Longest Yard.  British actor, Tom Courtenay, in his first major film role plays the downcast, but likeable youth from the seedy side of town.
Courtenay's character is saturated with events in his life for which he has no control.  He lives in poverty, his father dies, his mother's waiting in the wings-boyfriend is a jerk, and he has no job skills or future.  He is ultimately placed in a youth detention facility where he finds, to his warden's joy, that he has athletic ability.  He is ambivalent about this skill, but he can obtain privileges and possible early freedom if only he wins the running trophy for the warden.
The Burt Reynolds film, centered on his character developing an interest in his fellow prisoners to decide on how to respond to the warden's promised rewards and punishments.  The British version focuses almost completely on the character's internal conflict.  Ultimately, his decision is based on how he could best gain an aspect of control in his life.  His decision is based not for his peers, and not for the authorities, but for his own sense of self.  Aspects of the youth prison may seem funny by today's standard, but the story remains fresh and interesting.  I highly recommend it.",1086307200,,1290,4.774774774774775

So it goes for Colin, a man trapped at every turn. His life gets a lift when he joins the cross country team at the reform school. The scenes of him running freely through the woods during meets are poetry on film. Colin lashes out against his fate and lot with one bold pause at the end.

2680877,5,B000JYW5E6,"Tony Richardon's grim evocation of the experience of one bottom feeder at the low base of Britain's crumbling class pyramid features editing as harsh - and cinematically effective, especially in the film's well-placed flahsbacks - as this story of hard-bitten young Colin Smith (grittily portrayed by Tom Courtenay). For a petty theft Smith is sentenced to borstal (reform school) where his speed in the long distance run elevates him, in the eyes of his inmate brethren, to become the ""guvnor's blue-eyed boy"", because the warden's goal is to win the special long distance running cup in the borstal's trial athletic competition against an upper-class public school.  Smith finds himself trapped between the guvnor's self-serving, manipulative solicitude and the class-based peer pressure of his borstal mates. Courtenay plays out Smith's repsonse to his dilemma with breathless, bristling, teeth-clenched defiance that the film, grippingly, doesn't reveal until its withering d&eacute;nouement.
Avis Bunnage lends a biting performance as Smith's mother: a woman hardened by her straitened life circumstance as the working class widow of a resentful factory worker, struggling on welfare to raise her children in a grimy, shabbily built, claustrophobic low-income dwelling. Alec McCowen, as the borstal's pyschologist, deftly adds depth to the story as a well-meaning advocate of fresh approaches to rehabilitating inmates, whose efforts are trumped by the warden's timeworn methods. As the warden Michael Redgrave communicates all that's right - and wrong - about the upper reaches of the class pyramid.
  Developed from a short story by Alan Sillitoe (author of Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, and screenwriter of that  eponymous 1961 film), rooted in industrial Nottigham, filmed in sooty, bleak black & white, 1962's The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner may, in 2002, feel a bit dated, yet its theme of the bottom-of-the-food-chain working class individual clamped in the maws of animals and powers beyond his influence remains trenchant, timeless and thought-provoking.",1010016000,,2084,5.606349206349206
2680878,5,B000JYW5E6,"I saw this British film when it first came out in 1962 and never forgot it. I even remember an argument I had with my aunt about its controversial theme - that of an alienated angry young man who defiantly refuses to conform to the system.  Shot in black and white, the video stars Tom Courtenay as a working class Nottingham youth who is sent to a reformatory because of a robbery.  Michael Redgrave is cast as the warden, referred to as the ""governor"" as this is a British film.  It is a modern reformatory, and plans are being made to for it to compete in sports with a private school.  The long distance run is considered the biggest prize and Courtenay is granted special privileges as he stands out as someone who could actually win. He's allowed to take long runs outside of the reformatory gates each day, and the cinematography here is outstanding.  During these runs, Courtenay experiences flashbacks of his life and we see a picture of its grimness.  We see his anger at the system and admire him for belief in his ideals.  And yet we also want him to win the race and move into a more privileged life. Finally the day of the run arrives.  And young Courtenay makes his decision. It is startling and yet something we can understand.  No wonder it's haunted me all these years.
Now, watching the video all these years later, I found it a little slow for my taste, especially since I already knew the ending.  And, also, as with many British films on video, I sometimes wish there were subtitles.  But this is a film that makes me think.  I think about choices I've made in my own life.

8153659,5,B000JYW5E6,"One of the most famous of the British New Wave or ""kitchen sink dramas"" that emerged as a vital force in cinema from the late fifties through sixties, The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner deserves its classic status and is as fresh today as it ever was.  Consistent with the general focus of these films on the lives of the working class, the film also takes place in the Midlands and North as they do, this time in Nottingham. Director Tony Richardson coming off Look Back In Anger and The Entertainer  managed to craft yet another brilliant look at  the British class system as the country moved out of the postwar period and into the sixties.

One of the keys to the film is its relatively fair and dispassionate view of  society,  demonizing neither side and avoiding polemic, instead showing how even a society trying to improve conditions can make a muddle of things. Tom Courtenay in his first major role as Colin is absolutely intense and riveting in a demanding role of a sullen and angry lad sent to Ruxton Towers, a relatively progressive reformatory in the country.  He has gotten in trouble with the law over a petty theft of cash and was living with his uncaring mother who is busy spending the small settlement she got after her husband's death and entertaining a new boyfriend.  This story is told in flashbacks while Colin adjusts to life with the other lads at Ruxton.

the staff at  Ruxton is portrayed sympathetically as  wanting to help the youths through hard work, athletics and psychological counseling. Michael Redgrave is perfect as the Governor,  too upper class to really understand the boys but  not the usual martinet.  He is particularly fixated with having one of his boys win a five mile race against  Ranley, a posh school which in the past would never have participated in athletics with a place like Ruxton. Then he notices that Colin is a superb runner, easily beating his previous star and he sets him apart for special training and favors including long runs outside the reformatory grounds. it's on these runs that Colin looks back on his life thus far. Though his home life is grim, there is also a beautifully shot , lyrical holiday at  a coastal resort town with his best friend Mike and two girls. Everything builds to the day of the big race and Colin's chance to shine.

Everything about the film works perfectly, and it retains that almost-documentary feeling of most of these British films that set them apart from the usual dramas of standard films. The black and white photography is so fine that you wouldn't want it to have been made in color, another  trait of these films. some people find tom Courtenay looking a bit too old for the role, and indeed, he seems to have always looked older than his age. But the role is so demanding that one cannot imagine anyone else in it and can only imagine how badly it might have failed had they picked someone only for looking like a teenager. The ending is full of surprises and its meaning is open to interpretation. In its day, I feel that the audience would have felt one way about it, but today it is much more open to other ways of viewing it, so much time and change have occurred. This is one of the great strengths of the film. It will always be relevant.

Now if only Amazon would get Richardson's A Taste of Honey  which unfortunately seems to be totally absent from the catalog right now.",1460160000,,3400,4.588429752066116
