8107808,5,B000E9X3AG,EXCELLENT DVD!!!!  My daughter and her friends LOVE the Paige's Workout Party DVDs. The dances in this DVD are so much fun for them...and they have performed the routines in their school talent shows. I have to admit that as a mom I enjoy dancing along too! What a great DVD and a great series!!!! *****************,1242777600,,315,4.625
8107809,1,B000E9X3AG,"I Bought this DVD for my two girls (7 & 10yrs) thinking it would be great exercise for them.
I was badly disappointed. Paige introduces 6-7 new moves at once and then expects the kids to do them -  after 5 min my kids sit down and just watch Paige move rather than moving themselves!  It is simply too difficult and kids give up trying. There is too much emphasis on choreography rather than just exercising....
So if you are looking for an exercise DVD for kids - this is not it!",1197763200,2,480,4.206521739130435
8107810,4,B000E9X3AG,"I bought this for my daughter just before she turned two because she loved to dance, but her dance moves consisted of jumping up and down.  We've had this DVD for about three months now, and she watches it at least three days a week!  While it is a long, complicated, fast paced routine, I wasn't expecting my 2 year old to be able to learn a routine anyway.  However, my husband and I have noticed our daughter learning alot of the moves, and she even narrates along with Paige through out the video.  Now when we are listening to the radio, she actually dances instead of just jumping up and down.  I wouldn't really recommend this video for a kids workout program, unless they plan on doing it over and over again to learn the routine, but I think it is a great video to just dance around and have fun, and learn a few new moves here and there.",1163980800,3,847,4.236024844720497
8107811,2,B000E9X3AG,"Shortened version: Don't buy this DVD unless you have an incredible memory.

Long version: My daughter started playing the DVD and sat and waited, because the actual dancing part wasn't for a bit. When the actual dancing part happened, Paige showed us about 7 dance moves then said do it. Of course, my daughter couldn't keep up. Then she showed us a whole new set of steps then said do it. After my daughter attempted to keep up on the second part, Paige told us to put it all together and do both parts. And yet again, my daughter couldn't keep up. It was when my daughter was watching Paige ""demonstrate"" the moves before doing them that I realized that my daughter isn't getting much excersize out of the DVD. I WOULD NOT recommend this DVD to anyone, especially to little kids, who would definetly not keep up to Paige's high memory rate.",1155254400,14,843,4.509803921568627
