As far the movie goes,its refreshing to see a movie that seeks finding redemption by using one's brain instead of the typical gunfire we are so used to seeing in most gangster films.",1459036800,,258,4.395833333333333
8738283,1,B017851C1A,"I am not sure why it is called ""Blood Feud"" other than ""Grace and Paul Come to Jesus"" wouldn't sell with that DVD cover. The film claims it is based on true events, for what it is worth. Paul (Micky Curate) gets out of prison and looks up his friend Grace (Paul King) who has come to Jesus. Grace is supposed to kill Paul, but opts not to do that leading to brief fist fights with the bad guys and saving Paul.

The film was short, boring, and ill acted. The killings are off screen and there is otherwise little action. Paul Lee King wasn't right for that role.

Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",1457740800,,596,4.173913043478261
