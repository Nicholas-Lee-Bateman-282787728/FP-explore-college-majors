When I finally had the time and opportunity to watch them, I was very disappointed because they froze within the first 5 minutes of play. If you do happen to order them, please test them out on your DVD player immediately upon arrival so you can return them if you encounter any problems. Good Luck.",1503014400,,425,4.532467532467533

8229178,5,B000XQ1H30,"I am almost a black belt from a 9th Dan  dojo in Tae Kwan Do, we sometimes like to train in other  MA interests when we finish our 3 years.  I have talked to Grandmaster Tatum he is as personable and honest on the phone as he is on film. Hes very real extremely dedeicated, sincere (has this how can we help you attitude) that's so rare today!

He  teaches so excellent on the film  he tells you what hes going to do and shows you in detail then usually looks right at you (camera) then tells you again and shows you a similar yet different approach what I
really liked is he shows some footage of a dojo in Spain at a seminar it made you feel like you were there with him..great film

keep up the fantastic work sir (kenpo  salute)..",1228089600,7,734,4.083916083916084
