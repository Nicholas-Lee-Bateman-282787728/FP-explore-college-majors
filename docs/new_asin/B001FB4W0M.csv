3566887,5,B001FB4W0M,This is the only show I go out of my way to watch.  This episode was great.  Dracula on a moped - hilarious!,1224374400,,108,3.652173913043478
3566888,5,B001FB4W0M,"I'm woefully behind in watching the great Universal monster flicks (something I am going to rectify pronto), but even still, I really love this episode! The black and white film stock, the Bernard Hermann/Franz Waxman-esque soundtrack, the opening credits which look like something straight out of a 1930s monster movie, the old-style iris-outs and wipe dissolves (even a shot that's a clear mimic of the camera 360-ing around Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak's kiss in ""Vertigo""), the atmospheric lighting and playfully cheezy sets -- splendid! The only thing missing is an angry mob with torches, but it would be hard to fit something like that into the tightly-woven narrative. It's more than a deliberately corny episode, the writing is still top-drawer and the character development is still at its peak. We even get to hear the monster's angle on what it feels like to be the monster, and why it sought to take control of things in such a gruesome way.

Oh, and the shot of Jensen Ackles in lederhosen: too cute for words!",1224288000,,1023,4.879310344827586
3566889,5,B001FB4W0M,"This season has to be one of the most tightly-wound ever in a tightly-written series with an incredible amount of attention to detail, and this episode tightens things a little more. The monster of the week has to be one of the more disturbing ones so far. Granted, we've seen a human turn into a monster before, but this one is more subtle and the transformation more gradual yet shocking in that it starts with something simple and seemingly harmless: who hasn't had a male relative or acquaintance who's cleaned out the refrigerator before... But what if it was more sinister than just the hungry-horrors...? (It also put me in mind of the hunger-demon in the debut arc of ""John Constantine: Hellblazer"") And at the same time, it seems to mirror the internal transformation going in in Sam, during Dean's sojourn in hell. But, after he used that ""let's talk about it"" ruse to coax the man-turned monster into a trap, can we really trust Sam to keep his promise to Dean? This is one season that I don't want to miss a minute of, and I'm grateful that Amazon is offering download episodes...",1224028800,,1092,4.634020618556701
3566890,5,B001FB4W0M,"I think this episode is one of the best, cause of sam using his power. We actually can see what he can do with it.",1223683200,,114,3.6
3566891,4,B001FB4W0M,"I was hoping Eric Kripke would dig into the backstory on John and Mary Winchester, but I'd almost set aside the hope, since it seemed a bit of a stretch to pull this off without disrupting the novel-like feel to the set up of the series. But... with an angel now as a recurring character in the series, the possibilities are expanded.

I'll admit, at first it was a bit of a stretch for me when it turns out Mary Winchester had ties to the kind of life John later would lead, but I rode with the idea and I'm glad I did: what at first seemed hokey winds up becoming the stuff of Greek tragedy. There's a few flaws: some of the slang in the dialogue isn't the sort of terminology that would have been used in the 1970s, but it's a minor thing I can easily set aside. Good, solid episode and while it fills in some of the backstory as to why the Yellow-Eyed Demon came for Sam as an infant in the first place, it still leaves you with a lot of questions that you're looking forward to seeing answered as the season unfolds...",1223510400,,1023,4.166666666666667
3566892,5,B001FB4W0M,"This is the only TV series out there that entertains with both horror and heart at the same time. It's a gore fest almost every week with a high body count, but the brothers Winchester's tortured co-dependent relationship is what will keep people addicted and coming back for more every week. Laugh and cry with the Winchester boys as they speed down the highway to meet their destiny. Season four is the best yet.",1223424000,4,414,4.608108108108108
3566893,5,B001FB4W0M,"The Winchester brothers are back, this time trying to discover who brought Dean back from the dead and why. This is an excellent show for horror fans who like good characterization and lots of family drama. Jensen Eckles is wonderful as stoic older brother Dean, and Jared P is awesome as well.  The horror is decent without being too graphic of frightening, so mature teens can enjoy this too.

I own all the seasons so far, and this one is off to an excellent start.",1222300800,4,468,4.4941176470588236
3566894,5,B001FB4W0M,"When season 3 of this show ended, Dean had been ripped apart by the hounds of hell and his spirit/soul was ensnared in some techno-web where he bled and screamed for his brother.

When we begin THIS season, he's been dead four months. There's no preamble here--he just comes back, immediately. It's not clear how or why; it's only clear that something pretty powerful brought him back (and decimated the landscape around him in the process).

This episode is VERY nicely put together, from the reunion scenes with Bobby and Sam to the end scene where Dean finds out precisely who brought him back (and wow, what a cutie his savior is!) and why, all the emotional pieces come together beautifully but not melodramatically, and there's humor and suspense throughout.

The coming season is set up, and there's enough in this one episode to tell us that season four will have more than the usual share of conflict between the brothers and between Dean and his fatalism.

Bravo!",1222041600,5,973,4.773809523809524

The start of the Angelic wars and the end of the Sam/Dean wolf pack.  I hate to say it but I was glad sam and dean was not the dynamic duo anymore but the awesome 3 Sam, Dean, and yes Castiel.  Glad they started the heaven wars or at least a supernatural version of what angels should look like.  I cant be the only guy that thinks every angle was perfect or was this sweet boy that only acted good, did good things, or was royal in every aspect of life.  Cant wait to re watch Castiel's rise to Fame and the Winchesters intro to God, heaven,  My lord etc.

since this excellent series s-h-o-u-l-d last at least as long as
THE SIMPSONS [And, OMG, there's NO comparison, there!]
This series, GRIMM, and THE WALKING DEAD are the only
reasons to watch broadcast-TV! Highly recommended... Oh!
And I think the actors ALL enjoy the characters they play... it shows on the screen.

3567333,4,B001FB4W0M,"I decided to wait to review season 4 of Supernatural until I have watched seasons 4, 5 & 6 all the way through, and I am happy I did.  Also, due to the show getting way more complicated than I anticipated (yay!) it is getting increasingly difficult to write these reviews without some spoilers - but, I WILL warn you, and I will also try to keep the spoilers in any review specific to the seasons that proceeded it. For instance, making sure you read the title of the review, if you haven't seen season 5 yet, DON'T read my review for season 6. That's about the best I can do. Because this show got complicated. Totally, wonderfully complicated.
Like many fans, season four has been my least favorite so far. But not for the reasons many of them site. So at this point I have to give you some perspective on me, personally. I am an agnostic leaning towards atheism in the strictest sense of the word: I am a secular humanist who feels that religions and their resulting ""dogmas"" (principles) were created by humans as fictitious morality plays - written primarily because we are a species that is afraid of the dark and we seek to hold each other's hands when surrounded by it - the text of which was later edited by ambitious people who wanted to gain control over something, whether it be bad behavior, money, power or other people. And now that the text is written in stone, those same kinds of people twist the dogma to get what they want. I ""believe"" in very few things, but one thing I thoroughly believe in is that when it comes to the human animal, everything is about control, pure and simple. But I, like every other person who has ever existed, has no idea what the truth is as to why we are here, and none of us can say with any honesty what, if anything, happens when we die.
That being said, in season 4, Supernatural's mythology took a turn that many people hated: the inclusion of angels, heaven, and ultimately, god. I find the argument that it jumped the shark for these changes to be silly! In a show that's been about demons and hell from the first episode, where else was it going to go? I think it was a natural progression, and in my opinion, a welcome one - and that's coming from a person who is not of faith. There is nothing else other than change that is going to keep a show like this going. The writers must embrace changes to the mythology and those changes must be logical - if not, sooner or later, even the most dim of viewers is going to say ""this sucks now"" and stop watching it.
While I had no problems with adding the light to the dark, nor with how they twisted and altered the very long-standing archetypes that are associated with Judeo-Christian faiths, along with many OTHER faiths, I still had trouble watching this season, mainly because it was mostly dramatic, and frequently depressing.
There were still some one-shot eps that were brilliant and funny (""Criss Angel Is a Douche Bag"" was particularly great!) Some characters were introduced, including the angel Castiel being played by the wonderful Misha Collins. Even more were killed. The show embraced a more experimental nature (Monster Movie, which put Ackles in Lederhosen no less!) and I am very pleased to say that they continued making happily twisted eps like that in 5 & 6 - mainly because they are very good at it! Time travel was experimented with, both literally and figuratively. In a scene from ""In the Beginning"", where Dean confronts his mother as a young single woman in 1973, and asks her to avoid her own death, Ackles' performance had me grabbing the tissues. He was, in short, amazing.
Even though this season was, for the most part, difficult to watch, it was also necessary to move the plot forward. If you are going to watch this show and want to keep going with it, you have to accept that or you will be lost, because as I said, the Impala is now rolling down that hill, man and it gets even more complicated after this. It was difficult, and the end was a slightly predictable cliffhanger. But it was still excellent, and I was pumped to move onto the next season.",1451088000,,4090,4.475234270414993

3567530,5,B001FB4W0M,"Probably the best season of the series, and not just due to the story arc.  Much due to the introduction of Castiel, played with great sincerity and therefore endearing humor by Misha Collins, whose addition was much welcomed.  You believe that he is an angel, and he is magnificent.  Extremely powerful, somewhat knowledgeable, and providing some comfort.  But in The Rapture, you see Castiel as human, what he was before he became a vessel, and his transformation is credible.  Regardless, he remains a mystery, and I enjoyed it whenever he was on screen.  So lovingly straight-laced, and therefore, he was very funny.  Also extremely awkward and wonderful.

There were some great episodes.  One of my favorite episodes in the entire series is In the Beginning featuring a very young Mary Campell, played perfectly by Amy Gumenick.  Mary Winchester has been played by other actresses, but Amy Gumenicks performance is my favorite.  Season 1 and 2 built up this great mystery of Mary Campbells death, which started John Winchester on his obsession, and it was delight to see how John and Mary once were, how sweet John once was, and how malice can consume and destroy a family.

""Wishful Thinking"" was quite humorous, especially the first half hour, and I love Anna Miltons introduction in ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" and ""Heaven and Hell.""  She has a strange look to her, so you sensed she was not who she said she was.  She was very sincere.  A very nice counterpart to Castiel.

I like the season but there were some missteps, and not all the episodes were good, and some were outright bad - actually detrimental.  The premise of On the Head of a Pin was just uncomfortable with Dean instructed to torture Alastair.  It also made Dean look weak, and I prefer to think that that particular episode does not exist at all. Good grief it was painful and bad.  I know Eric Kripke loathes those episodes where there are no ""supernatural"" elements featured but there are pivotal episodes, which are so badly executed, they undermine the whole series.  Are You There God?  Its Me, Dean Winchester could have been more polished.

I don't dislike Genevieve Cortese, and Im glad Jared Padalecki found love with her, but I loathed her in the role of Ruby.  Genevieve Cortese didn't have the same spunk and sarcasm as Katie Cassidy, whom the producers should have done everything to keep.  The other incarnations, however brief, via Anna Williams and Michelle-Hewitt Williams stayed true to Katie Cassidys interpretation, and were both more credible as Ruby.  The role was just not right for Genevieve Cortese.  There wasn't a single second that I believed her as Ruby.  It was almost as if she were a stand-in or understudy, taken in at the last minute, and she had not been the least bit prepared.  She was trying to fit into the contours of what another actress established, therefore she was terribly hampered.  I can't blame her, but I do blame the producers.

Still there were some great episodes and great new characters.  Not just Castiel and the young Mary Campbell, but also fan favorite, the prophet Chuck Shirley, whose appearance was just wonderful.  Yeah, he was a wimp and coward, but his flamboyance was a welcome pleasure.  And then there was  younger brother  Adam Milligan, whose earnestness was another welcome character.  Dean resents it, but his loyalty to his father is absolute; it is Sam who is disgusted.

It was a season of great new characters, and again, though not all the episodes were good, those episodes focusing on the overall storyline were quite entertaining.",1432944000,2,3593,4.8407224958949095

3567598,5,B001FB4W0M,"Somehow Supernatural just keeps getting better.  One would have to give great praise to both the writers, actors, producers and directors.  Add the character Cass/Castiel (extremely well played by Misha Collins), Supernatural has taken Dean from Hell and Sam closer to Hell.

Without spoiling anything, this season has been the best of the lot.  Usually Season 1 has everything that's going to be worthwhile.  And why not?  One never knows if there's going to be a Season 2.  Since the program gained a decent following, their continued life on television seemed a sure thing.

The staff and cast have NOT rested on their laurels as is so common with a television program.  These folks, especially the writers and main actors, have gotten better and better with time.  While much is still in common with The X-Files, owing to some directors from there (and possibly writers too), the uniqueness is enough it remains its own program and not a clone of anything else.  Supernatural should live, and I use that term every so loosely considering the subject matter of the program, a long and healthy life.",1426204800,,1101,4.897297297297297

The mythology and story lines are mesmerizing and semi-addictive.

Season 5 being the best.
This season is very informative necessary
To explain and further the series mythology.

Confused angel Castiel as he wades
Through a Divine mission constantly
At odds with what he witnesses and
His own growing immersion in
The oh so ever confusing issue
Of  independent thought and the
Dilemma of choice.

The best thing about this show is the absolute, amazing relationship between Dean and Sam, and the actors that play them. I love that the show isn't afraid to make fun of itself and will take an episode or two to lighten things up when it gets too serious. The addition of Castiel was genius, heck, all the supporting characters are fantastic. Honestly, I waited a long time to watch Supernatural because I was afraid it would be too scary, and it can be on occasion, but not enough to keep away an interested viewer.",1414713600,,648,4.453781512605042

However I had multiple issues with this season. The behavior of many angels did not feel right as it seemed like they were actually the bad guys more often then the demons. The season felt negative in many situations, the demon army released in season 2 seems to have been completly forgotten, Ruby wasn't as interesting to watch this time around. Ultimatly it's still good but a step down.",1399593600,,644,4.608695652173913

3567879,5,B001FB4W0M,"Supernatural is one of the most interesting and underappreciated series on TV. It combines humor, horror and spiritual themes without being saccharin.  Although Christianity is not at all overt in the series, the mindset and stories come from the last several millennia of Christian thinking.  Siupernatural makes a statement that dabbling in witchcraft and demonology is dangerous and wrong.  The rituals are strongly based on John Dee's enochian work, including the sigil of  Amareth.  Incredibly well done. I don't understand how they hooked up with a technical advisor that was so well versed.  My only complaint is that a coujple of demons are named ""Aleister"" and ""Crowley,"" which I think is rather uncalled for.  Many of the bad guys are named after goetic spirits, which is quite appropriate.  As a member of the OTO, I love the use of the unicursal hexagram as the sigil of the ""Men of Letters,"" identified later in the series. This season is the beginning of the time when the series really hit its stride.",1399420800,,1016,4.935294117647059

3567938,4,B001FB4W0M,A good show but not as good as the first 3 seasons. Dean comes back from Hell meets a angel and is told he the only hope. Season has some good points but the ending was not as strong. If  you like the other seasons most people still love this season,1393977600,,249,3.8823529411764706
3567939,5,B001FB4W0M,"I have no complaints whatsoever.  The disks are in perfect condition as well as the packaging.  It's beautiful!

3567974,4,B001FB4W0M,"Love the series although there were a few episodes that were disappointing.  Would have liked to see more of the childhood experiences, but overall, the series is definitely worth the time to watch",1392681600,,197,4.96969696969697
3567975,5,B001FB4W0M,When sifting through the many mundane TV series out there there are times that you fine jewels of shows like the Stargate series or Breaking Bad. Now people can say that they hate those shows and that is there opinion. But with supernatural you get everything; it starts with a brother to brother bound that is to funny to resist watching followed by history and lore of many different religions and colts( some accurate some not) and it ends with the BAness of the brothers killing evil. from there it branches adding angels and the devil the apocalypse and the horsemen. In the end it is a great series worth many re-watches.,1391990400,,627,4.607142857142857

3567979,5,B001FB4W0M,"Blu-ray is the greatest, so many extras to watch.  Love it.  This was the best season as far as telling the story of ""Supernatural"" especially for me who came to the series during 2010 and had to play catch up with the plot and meaning of this Sci-fi journey.  Sharing the spooky ride in the '67 Chevy Impala with Sam and Dean and waiting each episode wondering which state we're going to find the next creepy creature.  The cast and crew on this show are unbelievably talented.  Love it!  Thanks for having these DVD's available!",1391299200,,530,4.526315789473684

When I realized it was going on nine seasons I thought maybe it's time to check it out.  Well, now I like the show.  The guys are cute, pretty good actors, there are good story lines between the brothers and it's always good to see people struggle with real emotional conflict over fantastical situations.  All and all I'd watch it again and again.",1390953600,,469,4.344827586206897

Misha Collins is a standout, the character of Castiel adding a needed dynamic to the show.

3568301,4,B001FB4W0M,This is a great show but I'm not currently up to date though other people say that it is still good. However I do know that once the show incorporated the Angels it pretty much had to stay at that level. I think they probably should have drawn out the lesser monsters for a few more seasons. I mean now that they have incorporated the Devil and God and Angels they have kind of locked themselves into it. They can't exactly start hunting the peon ghosts and monsters from the early seasons and there really isn't any higher to go beyond Angels/Demons/God/Devil level.,1376611200,,567,4.514563106796117

Obivously or not, in order to understand anything in the later seasons, this one must be watched. I love how the series still has fun episodes and hilarious scene thrown in with the deeper, darker stuff. It makes it well rounded and you'll find yourself itching for more!
Also, this is a crazy awesome price for the seasons- in stores they are $30-40, depending on the season.",1375228800,,464,4.535714285714286
3568367,5,B001FB4W0M,"I love Supernatural.  For me, it's the best Sci-Fi/Fantasy series currently in production, and I've been watching it since Episode 1.  They bridge the plot lines between seasons so well, infuse new characters without ever truly ""jumping the shark"", and the humor is just awesome.
To compare to other series out there:
I tend to think of the first three seasons at least as kind of a ""freelance x-files"", and even some episodes after.  Just instead of using UFO's as a long term story ark, there are a few other main antagonists.  (Note: no significant UFO content in this series, if that's what you're looking for.)
I'm Not much of a Buffy the Vampire Slayer fan, but I know a lot of people who liked that and like this.  On the other hand, I find Supernatural to be a lot grittier, better special effects, and less comic-book like than any of the episodes of Buffy I've seen.  So don't take one for granted as the other.
For those that are looking more for a ""scare the crap out of me, can't go to bed"" type series, I have to say it's a 50/50 shot.  On one hand my girlfriend will not watch this without me there and spending the night, so for some it will have that effect.  On the other hand it's been rare that I've had trouble sleeping.

Sorry for anyone who's looking for comments on this season in particular, I like the series enough I'm currently in the habit of just buying them all so I can re-watch in future years... except I will comment that Castiel became of my favorite sci-fi characters ever. :-P",1374969600,,1514,4.41726618705036

Series start with two boys, brothers whose characters and personalities emerge as you go through the episodes with them. Subtle nuances in the role are superbly handled by Jensen and Jared along with other cast members. Later seasons are deeper in meaning because the estranged brothers develop their relationship and pick up the pace as the storyline progresses.
Chemistry between the main actors which shows on-set or even during interviews is an incredible match to the story line, the on-screen brotherly ribbing, smart-assery, pranks, but also genuine caring and brotherly love shine through, which makes the series irresistible.",1370476800,,884,5.359712230215828

Castiel and Chuck are pretty much the only things that save this season from being awful. The angel struggling to understand humanity and deal with his feelings for Dean and the ""Prophet"" wanting to help Sam and Dean but being unable to directly interfere and only watch and hope they make the right choices make this a very riveting season.

3568856,5,B001FB4W0M,"My god, this show is awesome!  The acting is good, so is the writing, the pace, and what I like most about this show is that it keeps topping itself.  In this season, there are new character, new crisis, and more complex story lines.  The introduction of Castiel into the plot was perfect!  Even when you first meet him and his actions come across as 'cold', he strikes you as a fascinating character that will soon develop into something fantastic that will become very lovable.  Some episodes in this season are priceless such as 'Monster Movie, In the Beginning, Yellow Fever, Wishful Thinking, it's the great pumpkin, san winchester, after school special, it's a terrible life, monster at the end of this book, i know what you did last summer, heaven and hell, the rapture, lucifer rising, and death takes a holiday'.  This was a consistently good season!

And as for those who criticize the story lines, I disagree and I think they are looking for things to complain about.  Also, I feel that if they didn't secretly worship the show, then they wouldn't be watching it.",1348185600,,1074,4.705882352941177

3568935,5,B001FB4W0M,"Seriously, this show is not at all what you would expect. Yes it has two hunky guys as main characters and ridiculous sounding plots. However, it is not a teeny show like Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It goes through common urban legends, myths etc with an awesomely compelling plot with a story line depth that connects you to the characters. I am not a gore movie or horror fan. I was turned on to this but my BFF and her room mate who talked about it constantly.

In all seriousness this show really has some of the BEST acting EVER on a TV program. The way the stories are written the characters can go from polar opposites at any moment and all the actors do it well.

Misha (Castiel the angel) is an AMAZING addition to the crew. I think i like him the most, even though I adore Sam and Dean. I hope they keep him around for a very long time!! <3",1338336000,2,848,4.164634146341464

I too would like to watch a show without a writer's/producer's/director's political views being inserted into the story. Seriously, it's pathetic how Liberals love to jam their political views down your throat even on a fantasy show about the paranormal. This season the writers' had Dean say: ""Joe the plumber...what a douche"". Let's imagine for a moment in Season 3, if the writers had replaced a ""special parking place in Hell for Chaney"" with a ""special parking place in Hell for Obama"". Liberals would be screaming racism. Or how about if the writers had mentioned Rev. Jeremiah Wright and his racist quotes? Liberals would be calling for the cancellation of the show and demanding an apology. Clearly a Liberal double standard. In Season 5, they even go as far as to insert Sarah Palin into one of the episodes! I can't believe no one else pointed this out.  I have watched Supernatural Seasons 1-6 up to this point, and from Season 4 on, it's just gone downhill. I loved Seasons 1 and 2, before the writers' political views were sewn into the story.",1333238400,5,1154,4.741293532338308

3569070,5,B001FB4W0M,"To resuscitate someone who is being tortured in hell is not a simple thing, especially when this character does not even believe in God, though he believes in the devil, monsters and other demons. One could think that this resuscitation could lead him to a better understanding of what he calls the supernatural. But Dean is a very stubborn mind. He negotiated himself with some demon the deal that saved Sam's life and killed him within twelve months, and yet he does not want to believe in the existence of a good principle, good supernatural being somewhere in this vast cosmos.

The authors then take the precaution to come up with a resurrection that is not too iffy that is to say unbelievable, even with a very wide fictional mind. Dean is thus gotten out of hell by an angel, Castiel, and this fourth season is the season of the angels, among other supernatural beings. The angels are new at the job here and also very difficult to understand since their logic is a logic of obedience. Don't think, just obey. God is the only one who can provide the world with anything like a logic. A resurrection that is also the beginning of the Apocalypse, as we learn that during his stay in Hell, Dean broke the first Seal and started the Apocalypse.

Castiel is the angel who is attached to Dean but he sure is not well adapted to this professional unbeliever as for the divine. He is doubled with Uriel, the angel of death, who is black but who will reveal himself a traitor and Castiel will have to kill him. Then Zachariah will come as the boss of poor Castiel and this Zachariah being white cannot be a traitor, could he now, but he is a stubborn non-questioner. Obey first and don't ask question afterwards. This will lead to the disobedience of Castiel, which will not change one iota to the destiny of the world. Hence Castiel becomes himself a traitor, but not to his newly made friends, the Winchester brothers, but to his hierarchy and an absent God.

There is also a fallen angel, Anna, who disobeyed and is thus rejected on earth to err and haunt but she manages to get close to the Winchesters and she manages in a fight between the Winchesters and Uriel to recapture her grace that Uriel was carrying in a glass tube around his neck and she is reinstated into her angel status. This shows, if it were necessary to show such a thing that the house of God is not particularly clean and orderly. There is quite some mess in that house, with traitors and disobedient angels and the boss, God, doing nothing about it as if he were impotent or just unaware, which is even worse than being impotent, since it is incompetence which is at stake here. But we learn that God is just not here, not willing to interfere with human affairs.

But who is Castiel? That question is answered in this season, and that tells us what angels are. Angels were the first creatures created by God, whereas Demons are twisted human souls; but they do need a human body to be able to walk the Earth, without destroying everything. They are spirits that have to inhabit a human body to be able to intervene in the world's affairs and among humans. In other words they are not better than demons. Angels need the acceptance of the human they plan to inhabit before going inside him or her, whereas Demons just invade humans without asking questions. One day a simple man, Jimmy Novac from Pontiac, Illinois, is literally captured by the spirit of an angel and he becomes an angel and disappears from his family. To make sure we understand very well that fact, Castiel is removed from the body of Jimmy Novac who goes back to his life with his family. But he is the direct target of all kinds of demons and his family is at risk. So accepts a second time to go on an angel mission, driven away by Sam and Dean.

But the conclusion of this angel is: ""I serve heaven. I don't serve man. And I certainly don't serve you!"" he says to Dean and Sam. He is supposed to look after Dean and yet he does not serve him. He only obeys orders from a God who ""has left the house"" as Zachariah so clearly says. And yet there is a double mission that Castiel must carry out. He must make sure that Sam is protected from Dean and Bobby who are trying to wean him from the demonic blood he has taken the habit of drinking. With his special nature and the fact that he was fed with demon blood when 6 months old (from the Yellow Eyed Demon, named Azazel, that was killed in Season 2), Sam gets stronger when he drinks demon blood, developing his psychic powers. Thinking that it is their mission to stop the Apocalypse, Sam and Castiel, and to a lesser extent Dean, are willing to do anything to destroy the Demon responsible for the breaking of the other 65 Seals (the breaking of 66 Seals should free Lucifer, the Fallen Angel, from his cage). Ruby seems to be on their side and tracks the demons for them, also giving demon blood to Sam. Yet demon blood will become an issue between the two brothers, Dean starting to feel that his brother is losing some of his humanity.

On the other hand Castiel has to prepare Dean for the next mission that is revealed at the end of this season: he is the one who is going to defeat Lucifer after his liberation from his cage. What links the two missions is that Lilith is maybe a demon but she is the last seal that is to be broken before Lucifer can come out of his cage. Killing Lilith is breaking the sixty-sixth seal if that is the proper number. So Sam has to kill her, hence he has to get addicted to demon blood to be strong enough, and then when .Lucifer is out Dean is the one who is going to defeat Lucifer.

That's what these angels call the wider picture, not the survival or salvation of a few people who are possessed by some demons, but the salvation of the whole humanity after it is cleaned up of all the unworthy people and after the universe is cleaned up of all its demonic forces. A beautiful program that is described in the Book of Revelation, the Apocalypse, the killing of such a proportion of humanity wavering between one third and two thirds if not all of the living and the resurrection of a small proportion of those who died through the centuries. But where is the general of that war? Where is the master mind of this world?

God has left the house, don't forget.

That's when the two brothers get into the wider picture. We all know about the love of these two men that I would like to call boys (with flashbacks to their infancy, childhood and teenage) and yet are, let's agree to disagree on that term, young men. We all know that this love became sour little by little because of the impossibility to actually share their feelings for many and varied reasons. Since Sam has in him some demonic blood, he is different, abnormal and that abnormality was identified as wanting to go to law school and be a lawyer. He is a monster and Dean cannot admit it up to this fourth season because that would mean fighting to kill him, a brother he loves deeply.

On the other hand, and this season is quite clear about the lack of communication, both Sam cannot speak of his feelings as a partially demonic being nor Dean as a resurrected person has spent four months of human time in hell, maybe four for forty years of hellish time, and he cannot tell anything to his own brother about it. In the same way Sam cannot speak to Dean because Dean is not like him since he is partly demonic, hence on the side of those who tortured his brother and thus Dean would not understand, and Dean cannot speak of his sojourn in hell because he finally, but too late, admits that he enjoyed the suffering he gave to other, being one of Hell's torturers, because it more or less justified him in his own choices, which is to hunt and kill all monsters, including his own brother.

Speaking of existential dilemmas we can hardly find a better illustration and realization that this one.

And if it were that simple, there would be no real problem. But both of them are haunted by supernatural events and beings. Dean is haunted by his own guardian angel, Castiel, and the boss of this being, Uriel, a traitor, and Zachariah, a blind obedient subject. And then he is haunted by all kinds of demons who try to approach him, like Ruby, who he will kill at the very end of the season after Lucifer got out of his cage, freeing his own brother at the same time. Sam is haunted by his mother, his girlfriend Jessica and their burning death. He is haunted by the demonic blood he carries. He is haunted by Ruby who has to make sure he kills Lilith and is strong enough by then to do it. He is haunted by other demons who try to push him along.

And both are haunted by the fact that they have destroyed many demons and saved many potential victims but they also have killed innocent people who were possessed by demons or who became the victims of some vengeful act from Lilly, like Victor Henricksen. Sam has been hesitant on that procedure of killing demons: he has preferred for a while to exorcize the demons out of their victims, even though many did not survive their experience. You obviously cannot satisfy yourself and your brother, yourself and your guardian angel, yourself and your patronizing demon, etc. Nothing is simple in this world, not even double but multifarious and variegated.

All the more complicated because not one, not even the angels know what is going to happen, except maybe at the very last minute. No one knows? Wrong. One does. The writer who is writing the story of Sam and Dean about a couple of hours, a couple of days or a couple of weeks ahead of time. He is a prophet of the lord, and as such protected by archangels, and his books will become The Winchester Gospel. But apparently no one can change what he has written. Yet at the end Castiel and Dean decide to check what he wrote to know where Sam is in order to be able to stop him breaking the seal because Lilith is the last seal.

But too bad again. Dean will arrive there. In Saint Mary's convent but too late. He will see Lilith dead, Lucifer coming out and he will kill Ruby, the demon and not only the borrowed body. Because the wider image of the situation is that Ruby has betrayed them both, making sure Sam will be strong enough to destroy the last Seal and free Lucifer from his cage. Sam is finished with his mission but he can be of use later, so let him get sorry and say so to Dean, and Dean is just starting his own mission by killing a lying manipulator and accepting Sam's apology and getting him back into the chuck wagon, or should I say the Chuck Shirley wagon? We will only know in the next season. But the team is on its two feet again. Let bygones be bygones and concentrate on the present future.

3569108,5,B001FB4W0M,"I'm a relatively new fan to Supernatural but I'd recommend it to anyone that's interested in great characters and great storytelling.

Each season gets darker than the previous but the producers have a way of keeping it watchable by mixing in lighter episodes. This season has some solid comedic episodes. Whether it's Monster Movie that is shot like an oldschool monster movie or Yellow Fever which has Dean scared like a little girl, there are plenty of episodes that remain fun, even as we watch Sam spiral down into the darkest part of his soul.

The draw to this show for me has always been the relationship between Sam and Dean. The emphasis on family and loyalty is inspiring and if you've been watching the show up until this point it becomes difficult to watch some of the character choices that are made. If you're looking for a great created universe that follows the rules it establishes and an emotional involvement with some great characters, Supernatural is the show for you.",1313971200,,990,4.783625730994152
3569109,5,B001FB4W0M,"Season Four of Supernatural ups the ante once again. The hosts of Heaven have finally sided with the brothers, but they are certainly not what anyone had expected. First off, the ending of the previous season left us in a quandary about the show's future.

Not to fear, this season contains some fairly epic scenes - the living teddy bear, the whole Oktoberfest episode, the meeting of a new angel, and from the word of mouth of someone is not of fan of time travel, the time travel episode is one of the best for the season. But we are firmly on the heels of uber-demon Lilith. And that was a spot of good news for the Winchester brothers.

Special Features are nothing but the expected: commentary on a few episodes, extended and unaired episodes, a gag real; there is a behind the scenes called The Mythology of Supernatural, split in three sections being Heaven, Hell, Purgatory. The tech specs are on par with the previous season set.

Supernatural doesn't seem to be slowing down whatsoever. In my eyes, its the best thing to be be in television or film in regards of the wanna-be thrillers or horror.",1313884800,,1107,4.58080808080808

the show is GREAT. i am glad i go hooked on it and hope this goes on a lot longer. if you are reading this and haven't seen an episode, you MUST start with season one or none of this make sense.

Also, Castiel. He is amazing.

Now, this can count as a minor spoiler...maybe? Anyway, if you don't like spoilers, try to stop reading.

Anyway, first three seasons I was a Sam fangirl. I actually think I kinda hated him this season. He was given the idiot ball, and held onto it with all his might. I mean, he had his reasons, but still, after a point it just got ridiculous. I hope he's better next season, and wait to see. Dean became my favorite of the brothers, and it made me realize that I'm a sucker for Break the Cutie (Sam in seasons 1-3, and Dean here).

Anyway, amazing season, full of action and twists and turns. A great buy, and I'll never regret getting it.

3569264,5,B001FB4W0M,"I love lore, myths, anything dealing with the supernatural. I own all of the prior seasons. While I cannot fault anyone for their opinion, in my opinion the shows just keeps getting better. There was a lot of talk about how the show would rebound after Dean's death in season three but I think the writers did a wonderful job. Some people do not think that angels and demons should have been explored on this show. Religion is rooted in mythology, anything that is not tangible is consider part of the supernatural world. Having read a lot of different books on angels; I know they are not like religions make them out to be. They are emotionless soldiers; who just follow Gods orders. Demons are the ones equipped with more human like attributes. Supernatural did a good job of displaying this.

There were some pretty good episodes this season as well. Wishful Thinking, being one of my favorites: seeing a giant teddy bear suffering and trying to kill himself left me at a loss for words. The casting of Castiel was great, Micha has great comic and dead pan delivery. There were flaws but not enough to warrant anything less than 5 stars. I did not like the new Ruby, but I enjoyed Sam pitfall into ""demonhood."" It explored an emotional irrational side of Sam. I enjoyed how Dean came back and how hell affected him.

I ordered this item from [...] and when it arrived four pieces of plastic holding the DVD flipbook in place had broken leaving the three double sided DVD holders floating around in the case, I called the store and they agreed to exchange it for me, I went to the back grabbed another copy took it to the front had them open it to ensure it was in good condition but it was broken as well. I went back and grabbed the remaining two copies and both of those were broken also, fortunately one was only cracked on the side of the case so the DVDs stay in place. If you are ordering this item you may want to stick to buying it from a store that will allow you to exchange with greater ease than an internet site. The season is okay, the packaging sucks. I mean really I can see one copy damaged in shipping but four out of four copies... all broken, ridiculous.",1277769600,,1346,4.2823529411764705
3569444,5,B001FB4W0M,"We have followed Supernatural since the beginning.  I don't think we've ever actually missed an episode.  This series is awesome.  If you liked X files, the Fringe...  if you like things that go bump in the night, or if you grew up on Are you Afraid of the Dark on Nickelodeon, this is a fantastic show to watch. You will not be disappointed.
  And with Season 4, it just kept it going. We get into a bit more of the lore, especially with Dean's returning, but the lore and the story never distracts from everything else.  that is where X Files stumbled.  It lost its way in its own mythology.  if you hadn't watched the show you couldn't pick it up.

 I will not put spoilers here, but it's fantastic.  The lore and mythology behind the monsters, goblins, the baddies, is all fairly accurate.  the writers for the show have made sure that they do their homework.

  This season also is home to the episode Family Remains, which in my book rivals  the X Files' Home (the banned episode with the Peacock Family, also from season 4 interestingly enough) in all out creepiness.

  excellent show.  Excellent season.  Still Awesome.",1277164800,,1128,4.562814070351759

I like how they developed the character so well and how the brothers changed because of the things they went through. One annoying fact, Dean's voice keep getting deeper... In this season, Dean is still being overly protective of Sam. He has more responsibility than just hunting monsters in this season. He's the ""chosen"" one by the angels. Yes, they introduced angels in this season. They have their own twisted agenda and the demons fear them.  Viewers also get to see ""softer"" side of Dean with his emotional scenes. Jensen is a great actor and fit for the role. Moreover Sam has changed, he's darker and more confused in this season. Sam character has definitely changed a lot in this one, from the all-American caring guy to a ""drug-addict"" junky. The best about this season is they introduced Castiel. I in love with him! Misha is a great addition (his acting and the character - Castiel) to the series. His expression is always innocent and oblivious, is so damn cute! Back on topic, the brothers are going after Lilith for ""revenge"" and they run into a whole new can-of-worms on their hand!",1276041600,,1226,4.675925925925926

3569492,5,B001FB4W0M,"I am a relatively new comer to Supernaturaul, the TV program. Being chronically ill and house-bound, I found daytime TV shallow, not entertaining, and tedious. But I happened upon this program about 2 brothers who roam the country, ridding the land of evil--whether it be demons, shape-shifters or whatever--,they see it as their job to rid the earth of these evils. Being a huge Buffy fan (and missing her terribly) this truly fit the bill of what I had been missing for the last several years: two regular guys, just wanting to do good, and taking on all sorts of evil--and WINNING! Yes! The good guys won!

So I quickly became addicted to the daily reruns shown, but soon found I was missing a lot of ""in"" jokes. So I logged onto Amazon (my favorite store ever) and found past seasons were for sale. Here, for a small amount of money, I could get all the past seasons, be able be watch loads of episodes, and not have to miss out on those ""in"" jokes anymore!

The Complete Fourth Season is great. Its packaging is much improved, allowing easy removal and return of the discs without the hassle of overlapping discs. The cinematography seems to be more clear on this, along with the lighting. If you like this show and want to see it at its best, I recommend buying the Complete Fourth Season on DVD; you won't be sorry.",1274572800,,1322,4.504166666666666

3569605,5,B001FB4W0M,The saga of the Winchester boys continues.  Fabulous series best appreciated if you start from season 1 for the back story and to understand the cast of characters (an episode with Dean returning to the past will fill in some of these details nicely)however Season 4 stands very well on its own with Dean returning from the depths of hell. Each episode moves the storyline along with plots that range from 4-10 on the creeped out scale.  And of course the boys are fabulous!,1272844800,,474,4.630952380952381
3569606,5,B001FB4W0M,"Season 4 continues with Dean returning from Hell. This entire season heads in a different direction that now involves Angels in the fight against Demons. There is a hidden agenda because they can see the future and both Sam and Dean are involved in monumental ways. This season follows in similar footsteps as the previous 3 with a great deal more humor added. Throw into the pot, the threat of the apocolypse and we know we're in for an exciting season. Dean (Ackles) plays an extremely well acted tortured character who has to come to terms with his time spent in the ""pit"" and the parts he has and will play the the coming apocolypse. Sam (Padelecki) has changed since his brother's ""death"" and is now a very troubled young man who has gone so far ""off the reservation"" that Dean has difficulty connecting with him again. This season shows the tug of war between brothers with 1 doubting his worthiness and the other, now an addict and obssessed with revenge. With the brother's fighting constantly and the Angels doing the same in heaven, it's a war that no one seems to win. Castiel is the Angel responsible for ""rescuing"" Dean from Hell and he now becomes a major character in the storyline. Where the Angels believe Sam to be an abomination, they are principally interested only in Dean. Sam on the other hand has his BFF, Ruby, and isn't aware of the dangers there until it is too late. Disc 2 of this season has some of the funniest episodes shown to date and is a must see over and over again. This season is a whole new ball game for the brothers and will not disappoint. The totally unexpected twist which involves the 2 brothers was not anticipated and leaves you to impatiently await Season 5. This is the countdown to the biggest mistake the boys have ever made. Much more pressure is put on the Dean character and Ackles does a brilliant job with this. So to with the Sam character, Padalecki portrays his obsessions convinvcingly. Positively a must see. Don't forget the Gag Reels and the end of each Season. Some are absolutely timeless. ""Eye of the Tiger"". Watch for it.",1272844800,,2089,4.573333333333333

Straight from the start they had us on the edge of our seats with the return of an uncertain character and the continuation of a great story. To be honest, I was a little worried after watching season 3. I was trying to figure out what they could do to keep me watching this show. The two main actors, Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles, really work well together and keep this show fresh this season. I have always been a fan of the supernatural and spiritual warfare. This season really went above and beyond when it came to continuing the story while still giving us fun episodes. The fighting between the heavenly host and the love to hate 'em demons only made me love the direction of this season more. A few well placed plot twists, and even better episode ideas really made this season engaging. I cannot recommend this show enough. If you have not started watching this show yet, now is a great time if not the best time to start tuning in. It is much more interesting if you have followed the whole series since the season premiere is the extention of a cliffhanger, but its still more than interesting enough to start here if you do not want to go back and watch them all.",1271721600,,1321,4.395918367346939

3569611,4,B001FB4W0M,"I pretty much turned off the TV for good about six years ago. Pity, because I missed the first three seasons of this series.

I took a chance on the 4th season of Supernatural, which I found on sale at a local establishment at a giveaway price. I am utterly amazed at the quality of this TV series.

Supernatural combines elements of good storytelling with pretty decent action. Its a fine example of what can be done with a TV series. There are times where it can be annoying, however. For example episode 14, Sam and Dean get saved from killing each other by Uncle Bobby in a classic deus ex machina. Uncle Bobby just comes from out of nowhere and saves the boys from beating each other to a pulp. Trite, boring, yuck, ew[...] Thankfully there isn't too much of that in this series.

I enjoy the classic '67 Chevy, Dean's looks too nice if it has been driven across the country hunting ghosts and demons. You've got to keep a car like that in a garage and spend some serious time working on it for it to look like that. Uncle Bobby's is more what I would expect, except he doesn't really go anywhere and spends alot of time at home. Shouldn't he have the near perfect Impala?

I also enjoy the angels versus demons battles. Sort of takes me back to reading Milton, where Satan was the faux-hero. Curiously these themes don't really seem out of place either for a fantasy/sci-fi TV series. The prophet episode may have been over the top, where an all-powerful angel appears to save the day. Puh-lease. Where is this angel when the apocalypse is about to happen?

I don't enjoy Dean's diatribes to his brother or his 'anguish' about what he did downstairs. If the guy has to speak more than two sentences, it annoys me. Get back to the ghosts. Anguish should make you a better hunter, not whining to the camera.

Overall, its a great series.",1271548800,2,1841,4.448071216617211

3569696,5,B001FB4W0M,"I enjoy this series tremendously. The most outstanding thing I've found, is the acting ability of Jensen Ackles. He starts out being a good actor, and then he's elevated to a great actor. If he ever gets a good script to do (Hollywood),AAA rated, watch out, he's off to the races. I don't have the t.v. channel that Supernatural comes on, so I've purchased the DVDs for each season. I'm amazed at how they've changed the concept of this program. They've turned it into an Armageddon type. I was soooo sorry to see Sam and Dean's father written out of the program. I for one, thought it always added a portion of suspense, not knowing when he'd show up to help his ""boys"". I guess if the scripts aren't top quality, Emmy's just ignores these types of programs. That's alright, Ackles will come into his own in due time, they probably think he's too green.

3569700,5,B001FB4W0M,"This is a show that only gets better with time.  Every season the writers find new and creative ways to keep us coming back.  We all knew that Dean would not stay in hell forever, and I was very curious how he would get out.  Never did I imagine that in addition to all the demons and ghosts we would have angels too.
This season the main story line revolves around the book of revelations in the bible.  The demons are breaking the 66 seals nessasary to raise Lucifer from hell, and the angels are supposedly trying to stop it.  It turns out that while Dean was in hell, he broke the first seal and put everything in motion.
Dean, Sam and Bobby are working their hardest, along side the angel Castiel, to prevent the seals from breaking, but are not haveing much luck.  It turns out that some of the angels want lucifer to rise in order to force a battle that they are convinced that they can win.
The entire season is not completly dedicated to the angels and demons storylines.  It would not be Supernatural if it did not include a few episodes mixed in that make us laugh.  My 2 favorites are Wishfull Thinking, and Yellow Fever.  Wishfull Thinking involves residents of a town whose every wish is being granted via a wishing well in a chinese resturant.  The only problem is that the wishes go bad.  Dean test it out, and wishes for a sandwich, only to get food poisoning from it, and a little girl wishes for her teddy bear to become real and life size, only to get life size teddy that drinks all day, steals porn, and tries to commit suicide because he feels that life has no meaning.  Yellow fever involves a new twist on the tradional ghost story.  Dean and Sam head to a town where healthy residents are droping dead of heart attacks.  It turns out that they are infected with ghost sickness, which makes them afraid of everything, extremely paranoid, and will die after 3 days unless they scare the ghost into exercising itself.  Dean winds up infected and there is an extemely entertaining moment of him running down the street in fear of his life from a small dog with a pink bow in its hair.
The season finale does a grerat job of wrapping up the season and setting up the next season.  We also find out the full truth about Ruby, and she gets what has been long coming to her.  The only real sour note is the ongoing storyline of Sam being addicted to demon blood.  I thought that was a little to crazy even for this show.

It's the format itself.  While I appreciate the fact that I can see ""Dean's"" freckles on occasion and the crispness of the images is outstanding, that means I can also count the pores of any actor on screen for more than a 12 seconds.  Which is nice...I guess. =/

It won't give me the option to go back to the beginning of the episode or the disc.  I have to take it out and wait a bit before I try running it again.  It's really weird and a pain to deal with.  This doesn't happen with any other Blu ray disc I use in the player.  Just the Supernatural Blu-Ray discs.
Aside from that, the other features aren't really anything special.  I was expecting something fantastic to be waiting in the extras.  There is nothing there that couldn't be found on the dvd. And to be quite honest, The whole experience has turned me off to Blu-Rays.  If I had to buy this all over again, I would have just bought the DVD.

3570410,3,B001FB4W0M,"I must put this out on the table:  Supernatural is the ONLY show I have EVER faithfully watched from the get-go. And while I'm not exactly a tv junkie, I do have a number of shows I enjoy.  But Supernatural is where my loyalty lies.  And I still continue in my devotion.  I'm a still a giddy supernatural fan girl.

That being said... what was up with this season?!

One of original favorites of the series was the individuality of the episodes. Mini-movies, they were.  Overarching plot line?  Sure, super, fine by me.  But this season was heading in more of the traditional serial fashion at the expense of the show's original lure:  various monsters/urban legends/folklore tidbits.

I think that is my biggest complaint.  But there are others.  If a show is going to keep up a serial feel, some consistency is needed.  I've never seen so much backtracking, gotchas, and never-mind-about-thats in my life.  So they want to bring in a Biblical and religious twist to the mythology. I don't mind at all.  But pick where you are going with the mythology, keep it in my mind, and stick to it--BEFORE you start making a bunch of episodes.

Half the time, I felt the story had no idea where it was going.

Were the creators trying to keep the faithful and the unfaithful alike happy? I realize the aforementioned Biblical and religious twist is a dangerous road, and overall I felt like the creators were doing a pretty good job of keeping the religion and spirituality in the territory of story fodder only without preaching religion nor tearing it down.  And on a personal note, the mythology they came up with was so different from my beliefs that it was very difficult to offend me.  But there was time when I felt my beliefs were offended, and I'm sure there was a time or two when others also felt the sting of preaching.

But again, it's a dangerous road, and again, I felt overall they kept it balanced.

Maybe they spent too much time worrying about that, though.

The beginning of the season pretty much states God has personally commanded Castiel to pull Dean from Hell.  Okay.  But then the rest of the season muddies that up.  So what's going on?  Who is good? Who is evil? Who is working for who?  Where the heck is God?  How much does he know?  Why does everyone keep saying different things?  Where is the rhyme and reason here?

Religion or anything else they could have used, it's a unfocused mess of direction.

Now on to the good stuff. It still is Supernatural.  The humor, storytelling, and character chemistry is alive and well.  The magic of this show is still going strong.

Only a few sentences, but I like to think it sums up the wonder and charm of the show.

If only this season had figured out where it was going...",1261785600,4,2741,4.520408163265306
3570411,5,B001FB4W0M,We love Supernatural so we had to have the 4th season. We will be buying the 5th also. Great show that's a relief from cops and docs.,1261440000,,133,3.962962962962963
3570412,2,B001FB4W0M,"I am frankly amazed at all of the 5 star reviews.  I, like many have been a fan of the series from its inception, but this season just lost it.  Clearly the production values have slipped and were in cost saving mode.  Most of the episodes barely get out of the boy's cheesy motel rooms.  Very few special effects save bright lights. To be honest I found this season a bit boring.  Few new adversaries, in fact when the boys do battle something, it is mostly a ""monster"" we have already seen before.

I am also surprised by the huge course change into ""Biblical"" subject matter.  The first 3 seasons avoided religion pretty much, and kept it purely fantasy, but not this season. Here we have angels and constant references to prophesy and Armageddon BUT surprise, the angels are lying, deceitful, violent, and threatening not unlike the ""other side"".  There is no ""Good Guy"" to root for.

More surprising is that apparently Lucifer is in on the action, but his antithesis, God, is off in Bermuda on vacation or something because in the story God has no clue what's going on.  Now I am not particularly religious but if you are going to quote Bible verses in the story, and follow a Biblical arch how is it that the Biblical nature of God....you know the ""knows when even a sparrow falls from a tree"" thing is totally ignored and God is portrayed as either dead, absent, doesn't give a damn, or dim witted.....or am I missing something.  Also the full on Demon, black eyes and all transition of Sam, and the silly demon blood addiction just doesn't seem to follow where the previous 3 seasons were going..

Finally I really, really hated to see the political message thrown in clearly to prove the writers Liberal bona fides.  Season 3 had it's ""special parking place in Hell for Chaney"" line, and this season had its ""Joe the plumber...what a douche"" line.  Why?  Purely gratuitous and serving no plot purpose, nor adding anything to the narrative.  Just inserted to show that cool people, like Dean are liberal. Can't I even watch a fantasy show about demon killing without politics?

Add to my disappointment with the stories the fact that the first three discs would not play properly, and the menu function did not work, and I would say I was NOT thrilled with this season.

I am giving it 2 stars because I have enjoyed the series up to this point.  I hope the last season doesn't continue the decline of this one.",1261353600,11,2419,4.5707656612529
3570473,5,B001FB4W0M,"Though most on this forum have given the show kudos for the angels versus demons storyline, I have to give the writers their ""props"" for finally bringing Dean, wonderfully played by Jensen Ackles, to the forefront of the season. The character gets to mature, realizing his place in the ongoing battle against the forces of evil as well as being Sam's (Jared Padalecki) protector, even when the younger brother is toying with his own inner ""demon"".  Ackles shines in ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", ""The Rapture"", the season opener ""Are You There, God? It's Me, Dean Winchester"", and the season-ending ""Lucifer Rising"".  Why he nor Padalecki have not received Emmy nominations is a further indictment against the decision makers of The Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.

Fine acting is also provided by Jim Beaver as the dependable and Johnny-on-the-spot Bobby Singer, Misha Collins as Castiel the angel, Genevieve Cortese as the ""is-she-a-good-demon-or-a-bad-demon"" Ruby, Robert Wisdom as Uriel, and Julie McNiven as Anna. The casting of ""The X-Files"" Mitch Pileggi as the Winchester boys' grandfather in ""In the Beginning"", as is the father-son team of John and Michael Rubenstein, along with character greats Barry Bostwick and Richard Libertini in ""Criss Angel is a Douche Bag,"" another outstanding episode.

""After School Special"" features younger versions of Sam and Dean, played convincingly by Colin Ford and Brock Kelly, respectively.  The installment also makes a commentary on the cruelty of high school students against each other.

""Monster Movie"" brilliantly pays homage to the classic horror films of the 30's and 40's, complete with period music, costuming, and black and white filming.

As a whole, the season features excellent writing, top-knotch direction, scoring, and some true thrills.  Because of the intensity of the latter, the writers separate the chills with some comedic and satirical dialog, many delivered by sardonic bliss by Ackles.

The compilation features audio commentary on two episodes, deleted scenes, and a ""gag"" reel that's not very funny, just a chance to see the guys mug for the camera.",1261267200,3,2140,5.289085545722714
3570474,5,B001FB4W0M,"Of all the seasons, I would have to say that this is the most poignant one. With Dean dealing with the horrendous circumstances he faced in hell and the new responsibilities that Sam feels he is responsible for, the story becomes a roller coaster ride of emotions.

Many times you will see the brothers caught between their emotional inclinations as well as their duty to save people from demons, vampires, and all the other forces that go bump in the night.

There is still plenty of action in this season, but what makes this season really interesting is the more complicated acting that both Jared and Jensen give to tell their troubled situations.

There are definitely more times that the brothers break down during this season, so if you don't like seeing men cry on screen, this might not be for you, but I felt that the actors were playing out the roles as competently as possible given the situations they were in.

If anything this was a season more focused on story-telling and emotional drama compared to the other seasons.",1260835200,,1035,4.701657458563536
3570475,5,B001FB4W0M,"The fourth season of Supernatural is, well, just awesome. In my own opinion, it is the best season in terms of story, dialogue, acting, and visuals. The season begins months after the third one ended with Dean going to hell and brings an entirely new dimension to the show; angels. Over the first three seasons, viewers are witness to dozens of supernatural horrors from ghosts, vampires, werewolves, demi-gods, witches, demons, etc. but for the first time ever in the series they finally see something in the show that's actually not out for Sam and Dean's head. It's really refreshing in a sense to see something good out there in what appears to be a sea of evil in the show. However, as the season progresses and without giving too much away it appears that few things are black and white and as is the case with Supernatural they're much more grey in the end. The fourth season is a full 22 episodes in length and just as the previous third season began to break away from the Monster of the Week format, the fourth season follows suit with every single episode containing some new development in the main storyline or mythos of the series building up to what appears to be the inevitable; the apocalypse. The story and dialogue of the fourth season are unmatched in terms of quality and Jensen (Dean) and Jared (Sam) really knock the acting out of the ballpark while Mischa Collins (Castiel) and Genevieve Cortese (Ruby) provide great supporting roles. Although season four fills out the definitive shift in the series that began in season three, if you're a fan of Supernautral you cannot possibly be disappointed by season four of the series and it's a must have not just for any Supernatural fan but any fan of flat-out good film.

This is a common complaint for tv series on blu ray and older movies too. The source material is often grainer and on less than todays movie quality filmstock.  So expect this to be less than a modern film in blu ray clarity and you'll love it.  The stories continue on with lots of humour and horror mixed for ulitmate tv horror viewing pleasure. Of course this is less bloody than a R rated movie and one should expect tv type violence similiar to the great ""Angel' , ""Charmed"" or ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" series that graced our screens in the last 14 years, although none of those have gotten a blu ray release yet sadly.

3570480,5,B001FB4W0M,"I stumbled upon this series a few months ago and it was like discovering Star Trek the first time.  Did they make this series just for me?  It has plenty to offer everyone from some great one liners and physical comedy to chilling stories that make you remember what a good old horror movie was about.

The Winchester boys, Dean (Jensen Ackles) the elder and Sam (Jared Padalecki) the younger have seen their relationship evolve and besides one lapse on the writers side to make Sam do something a lot of people what ""what the hell was he thinking"" I think they jabbed and joked around like only brothers could.  The funniest thing is that Sam is the responsible one, and Dean who pretty much raised Sam as their father was absent has regressed into a pretty fun hedonistic character.  And yet he is the one that gets allied with the Angels while Sam, the one who prayed and tried so hard to do right was the one slipping in with the demons.

I personally preferred the first seasons where the emphasis was on Ghostbusting although the story threads are now deeper (and I would guess offend some people).

Production values remain unchanged and it's still a good 'watch' if you're into this type of programme but i'd like to see a return of the humorous aspects evident in the earlier series.

3570564,5,B001FB4W0M,"This is one of my favorite shows on Television.  Yes sometimes its a bit gory but mostly it's just plain scary and fun.  There is a great mix of humor and scares and the interplay between all the characters is wonderful.  I especially appreciate Dean's range in acting - he has to be going places.

The show's premise is pretty straight forward:  the creatures of the night do exist, vampires, werewolves, boogymen, ghosts, demons, angels etc.

Dean and Sam are brothers who are ""hunters"" who go about ridding the world of these monsters of the night using all kinds of arcane and silly things like throwing salt in their faces etc.  Shotguns work too.

There are several overarching ARCs to the story which makes the show quite good.

Oh, they ride around the midwest in a very cool black Impala - wish I had one of those.  And yes, the flavor is pure Americana.  It's wonderful.

Give it a try if you haven't.

In the beginning is an episode I bought that I had missed - it's about how dean and sam got started literally.  It's worth watching if you want a bit of the background story.",1257811200,,1087,4.451776649746193

My name is Jenny Tolios and I have no social life!  As a result I spend a great deal of my time in front of my television set watching the brilliant, consummate, magnanimous, awesome and unmitigated genuis that is Supernatural! No, shoppers I don't just watch this series once or twice - I watch it over and over and over and over again!  So much so that friends are getting concerned that I at times blur reality and fantasy (so sometimes I call myself Mrs Dean Winchester - so what?!).

Unfortunately as I live in Australia the release date for these dvds was an unsatisfactory 6 months away - obviously NOT acceptable! If not for this incredible, stupendously innovative website, yours truly would have torn her hair out had I had to wait that long!

3570570,5,B001FB4W0M,"The familial chemistry of the Winchester brothers is back and harder than ever to beat for entertainment in this season.  This go round, each actor continues to bring a wide range of human emotion to his role and is man to the task as the brothers take separate paths.

The conflict between brothers, demons and angels escalates this season.  Episode 1 begins with Dean crawling out of a grave, no longer a captive in hell, but uninformed as to why.  He quickly tracks down Sam and the two are off again, fighting, laughing, making choices, and interacting more intensely than ever before.  The ""Supernatural"" mythology introduced in previous seasons continues to develop and, by the end of the season, it's clear that this show could easily go another two seasons (and I hope it does).

The ""Monster Movie"" and ""It's a Terrible Life"" episodes are excellent.

(Probably the most bothersome thing about ""Supernatural""--and it's not that big of a deal--is when Dean and Sam are working on a ghost case, discover the remains have been cremated and then say something to the effect of, ""There must be a lock of hair around or something.""  I mean, anyone who's ever been alive must have left hair, fingernail clippings and microbes all over the place. . . .  Minor gripe.)

And after four seasons, I still don't know who my favorite show-brother is, which (for me) is a strong indication of how well-written and well-acted this TV show really is.",1255564800,,1441,4.774193548387097

3570572,5,B001FB4W0M,"By the time you get to Season 4, you will be way past hooked on Supernatural. Watching Sam and Dean travel the countryside, ""hunting"" all sorts of evil is a kick. This season picks up where the last one left off, Dean stuck in Hell, and Sam taking his revenge by sending the black smoke back from whence it came. This one takes on color-eyed demons, movie monster madness, and ends with the big dark cheese himself rising up.

My worry about all shows like this (dare I mention The Dead Zone) is that the writers will lose their way and in turn the show will lose its freshness. Fortunately, that has not happened to Supernatural. The stories are as strong as ever. And as always, there is a blend of small monster stories mixed into a broader ""evil taking over the world"" quest. The brothers play off one another very well, each with his own strengths and weaknesses. And even though they are constantly at odds with one another (e.g. Sam doing the bump bump with Ruby), they both value family above all else.

3570696,5,B001FB4W0M,"It is not easy for writers and producers to maintain quality on a tv series, but they manage to do it with the 4th season of this entertaining, scary, funny  and provocative series.  Dean is back from hell, the angels are in town, the demons are gearing up, Lucifer is on the rise, and Sam has been taken in by Ruby's lies.  Bobby gets more screen time as the boys' surrogate father figure.  We even get to learn more about John and Mary Winchester before they were married, and how their history with Azazel goes back farther than imagined.

The show also explores spirituality to a degree.  Dean asks the questions that many of us ask:  Why are we here?  Why do good people suffer while evil seems to prevail?  Is there really a god, and what is the nature of this god?  Even the angels have doubts and failings, so it's hard to believe in something higher.

Fortunately, there are also some humorous episodes to take our minds off of the heavy stuff:  ""Wishful Thinking,"" featuring Ted Raimi and a giant, live teddy bear; ""It's a terrible life,"" with Dean and Sam in an alternate reality as corporate drones; and ""Yellow Fever,"" which ends with a nice little music video of Jensen Ackles lip syncing to ""Eye of the Tiger.""

The stories delve into supernatural investigation from two brothers who are part of a family heritage of hunters who hunt the supernatural. The actors who play the brothers are great and you never feel like they are acting as brothers but that they are both actually related. In this season Dean returns from being sent to Hell; he made a pact with a demon in order to save his brother.

It's short, but it's nicely edited and well-paced with no slow or awkward moments.  First 10 min is moderated, the other 20 being mainly fan questions, with a brief interruption from Supernatural's rival show- The Ghostfacers(that show sucks! just kidding).  This is a great bonus disc for me since i didn't get to go and can now watch some of that event at any time(and i think it's worth more than just one viewing).

DVD package- The packaging is different than the first 3 seasons as others have mentioned.  Gone is the fold out, panoramic style, now it's in a hard-cover case that holds all 6 discs in a plastic spindle(folks, i admit, i don't know the terminology for these things).  At first i thought this was an extremely cheap plastic spine that could fall out, but i think they made it that way on purpose in case you ever need to take the spine, with all 6 discs, out of its box for whatever reason.  The bonus disc gets it's own placeholder inside the box.  If you're going to buy season 4(and you should), the target version is the way to go with the fun bonus disc.  However, i could've sworn the ad last week said it was 45 min, not 30.  Of course, the standard extras are there as well- gag reel, 3 commentaries, 3 featurettes, and deleted scenes.

Me rambling- anyway, i tried season one when i thought it was a monster-of the-week show.  I found out it was more though thanks to the story arc or theme that runs through each season.  Since the first, i've been hooked and am now a fan/collector.  The best thing about the show has to be the chemistry of the characters, especially the Winchester brothers.  You could have a down show or two, or an episode whose 'monster' you don't like or care for, but it doesn't matter.  The real reason you tune in is to see the guys and how they deal with their ongoing situation together, and being a part of that journey.  So if you enjoy shows that have a horror theme, yet dramatic with its story arc, and infuse humor when needed, while centered around some lively characters, Supernatural is for you.",1252454400,9,2265,4.419277108433735

Amazing!!), extended and unaired scenes (love the extended Castiel Dean scene, the Uriel Castiel talk etc.), 3 commentaries (4.03 by Kripke and Carver, 4.21 by Singer and Gamble, 4.22 by Kripke) Luckily they returned from the way too short and not so entertaining closer look segments (season 3 box) to real episode commentaries. Some tv series have more commentaries but at least the 3 Supernatural ones are ALL entertaining but I wouldn't mind MORE on the next dvd box.

""The mythologies of Supernatural: From heaven to hell"" didn't sound very exciting to me but it's actually pretty good and detailed. The have some new experts talking about archangels, miracles, demons etc. and several members of the Supernatural crew (Kripke, Carver, Gamble, Edlund, Sgriccia etc.).
There are 3 Ghostfacers easter eggs which are nice but nothing new cause I'm a regular visitor at the ghosfacers website. I appreciate that we get easter eggs at all but I wished they had done something new for the dvds.

3571027,3,B001FB4W0M,"This review is for the Blu-ray edition of Supernatural, Season IV.  I was a little appalled at how it was put together.

 1. The menus have less information than the previous DVD editions of Seasons 1-3.
 2. A long and annoying advertisement for the Blu-ray edition at the beginning was really not needed.  I already shelled out the money for the BR, why are you pitching it to me again?
 3. The menus were confusing.  If you tried the ""Top Menu"" button on the remote, it would take you to the extras menu, which does NOT have a link to the regular episodes menu.
 4. The extras were not all hi-def.  This begs the question:  if you are shooting for hi-def, how much extra effort is really needed to produce the extras a tiny bit, just enough so they don't look like a VHS bootleg?

For these reasons, and not the plot, the BR version gets 3 stars.  Content is usually more important than form, as long as the form (i.e. state of the art consumer medium) looks more like state of the art consumer media and less like a turd.

As far as the content, this season was not very good either.  The show revved up in Seasons 1 through 3 like Dean's Challenger on a highway, and then in Season 4 it just took a side road more suitable for a dirt bike.

The overall plot sort of fits within the season's story-arc, but some the individual episodes seemed held together by a piece of gum.  Most of the supporting actors are REALLY BAD.  The new Ruby is stiff.  Chuckles doesn't belong there.  Alistair's second body could not act like the first body.  Anna gets mixed reviews depending on the episode at hand, but is not worth a lot overall.  The saving graces (other than the three amigos) are Uriel, Castiel, and the first Alistair.

Oh, and as far as eye candy for the guys, the Lilith in the last episode is the only one that fits nicely with the casting of Seasons 1 through 3 - other than the very brief cameos of some of the casting from previous seasons.",1252368000,,1952,4.319559228650138
3571028,2,B001FB4W0M,"I ordered Supernatural Season 4 blu-ray from Amazon.com and when it arrived I started what I thought would be a marathon watching the episodes.

Right away with the very first episode the quality of the video was terrible. The picture was full of grain (where there should not be grain) and overall the video just stunk. I did manage to sit through all the episodes over 4 nights because this show is one of the best on network tv and I've been a fan since day 1.

I am definitely not happy with the transfers of this season of Supernatural. Perhaps putting all 22 episodes on 4 discs didn't help the quality either. And, of course, none of the hi-def sites have had reviews of this set posted as of today or I would not have ordered it.

The Blu Ray transfer looks awful. It is grainy and inconsistent. I watched the last episode of season 4 on TV tonight and compared it to the Blu Ray and besides the HUGE CW logo on the screen the TV picture looked much clearer. I have a pretty good player. It's a Panasonic BD 30. It is fully updated and in perfect working condition. I can't believe they did such a BAD JOB on such a GREAT SHOW.,1251936000,14,542,4.074766355140187

The color pallet for this show has always been dark and subdued but they just don't ""pop"" like HD really should.  Sound is standard Dolby 5.1, same as DVD.

3571090,5,B001FB4W0M,"Maybe I'm a little wacko, but one of the most important things in a DVD release to me is the packaging (i.e. how well it allows the discs to release without bending). Supernatural is a great show and Season 4 is among the best of the best, so an easy 5 stars in that department. I don't like this style of packaging though because I find it difficult to remove the discs without flexing them. Am I missing some secret removal technique? Now I'm no expert on DVD manufacturing, but it seems that repeat bending would weaken the glue in the middle of the discs, causing them to eventually split apart (delaminate). Maybe it's an evil conspriacy to try and get everyone to buy the same product over and over again, as it wears out prematurely...I dunno.

Is anyone else anal about DVD packaging like me? Everyone seems to be fine with it so far, so maybe I'm just a weirdo. I'm fully aware that I have multiple DVD reviews that mainly gripe about packaging, but it's something I think often gets overlooked. I just think that DVD packaging should be standard somehow and that it should have a simple button release system that pops the discs out...you know what I mean. Regardless of the packaging though, buy Season 4 of Supernatual...it's worth it.",1251763200,3,1247,4.566964285714286
3571091,5,B001FB4W0M,"Revised for the Blu-ray:

Dean returns from Hell a changed man. Suddenly he finds he's working for God; An angel named Castiel brings Dean back because he has a mission for him--to stop the seventh seal from being broken and allowing Satan to roam free. Dean IS on a mission from God he just doesn't know all the details yet.

The fourth season saw major changes in store for Sam and Dean Winchester. Creator/producer and writer Eric Kripke begins winding up his five year story arc for the Winchester brothers and their constant battle with demons and evil. During the fourth season--one fo the best by the way--Sam and Dean have to stop something that is killing angels, have a close encounter with movie monsters that have come to life and Dean gets to meet his grandfather and grandmother when he gets thrown into the past.

The direction is top notch as are the production values (in fact I can only think of one other fantasy/horror series that looks as good as ""Supernatural"" and that's ""Fringe"" which also had a strong first season). We get a trio of commentary tracks, a number of very good featurettes including one that focuses on the mythology of the series, a gag reel and deleted scenes.

I had the DVD before returning it (and being able to get the Blu-ray instead). The DVD looks quite good with nice detail, colors, etc. BUT the Blu-ray looks truly stunning. The only flaw is the menu for the Blu-ray. For some reason everytime you jump past the ads you're taken to the ""special features"" menu and you can have a hard time getting back to the main menu. It's a bit sloppy in terms of the Blu-ray authoring but otherwise it is a terrific set. The show looks intentionally grainy with colors often washed out (it's just the look of the show).

Over all this is probably the strongest season of the show to date with gore, scary episodes and--yep--off beat sarcastic humor.",1251763200,3,1887,4.604166666666667

Love almost everything about this season and am very excited for the Fifth and hopefully last season.
Yes I do hope this is the last season. The creator had an idea for 5 seasons and once he completes the story I want the show to finish. I don't want this show to go the route of Smallville and One Tree Hill that just keep going until everyone looses interest.",1251763200,2,674,4.4

Let me just say that was a lot of computer time to finish this season but Oh MY GOD was it worth it! Season 4 is bar far the best season in my opinion. Just the introduction of the Angels for me made it so cool and Sam and Dean trying to stop Lilith from opening the 66 seals!!! ahhhh it was just awesome. And surprisingly this was without a doubt THE FUNNIEST season of Supernatural ever. Dean is freakin hilarious this time around even more so than usual.

They need to keep going with this show until it has nothing more to tell. I believe and this is just me and i don't know if anyone agrees. They need to keep going since this show is so popular. Very popular. We need to get the scare back like the 1st season. 2nd was good....3rd was too short. 4th was very good. Ive got some ideas if they wanna hear it for the show or maybe from the fans!

3571131,5,B001FB4W0M,"Note: Obviously, this is only a review of the show, not the DVDs themselves, and readily spoils material from earlier seasons.

Nowadays the trend in television is to peak early and stay on the air too long. Thus far, Supernatural has avoided these pitfalls, and has steadily improved from the show's entertaining, but hardly remarkable first season, which focused on conventional monsters, urban legends and horror film homages. Season 2 proved to be a substantial leap, where the show expanded and detailed the demonic underpinnings of the narrative, and with season 4 we see another increase in quality. While Supernatural always had individually entertaining episodes, it was only after Dean's (Jensen Ackles) Faustian bargain concluding season 2 that the central story arc came into focus. Now the mythology grows more impressive, with Dean mysteriously retrieved from hell by a disturbingly impassive, stoic angel Castiel (Misha Collins), and called to assist in the struggle against Lilith. Some are surely skeptical about the introduction of angels, as they aren't the coolest supernatural figures around, but Kripke and the host (haha) of writers provide an atypically powerful, unnerving portrayal. While wussy, friendly angels are common in modern popular culture, Supernatural draws upon a more biblical and Miltonian view of angels as fierce warriors and messengers. Moreover, the angels aren't precisely friends to humanity, but simply oppose the demonic hordes as well and will use the Winchesters as necessary to combat them. Misha Collins's Castiel, the most prominent angelic figure, is the most effective addition to the show. Collins's performance is brilliantly minimalistic, with his ragged look and deliberate movements perfectly suggesting a lack of familiarity with his body. Even better, Collins slowly inserts a subtle sense of humanity into the role as Castiel grows more conflicted about his duties, and finally creates truly intriguing character to go along with the Winchesters.

Simultaneously, Supernatural complicates the central relationship between Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean. While at the show's beginning it was the loyal Dean that dragged a rebellious Sam back into the ""family business,"" the roles are now substantially shifted: Dean has, unsurprisingly, been scarred and left somewhat hesitant by his months in hell, while Sam has learned to work by himself, even expanding his demonic powers which he had sworn to forsake. (And yes, the shifty but supposedly pro-human demon Ruby has returned, though now portrayed by the less attractive Genevieve Cortese.) Using a fraternal relationship as the heart of the show proves to be the series most impressive element. While, ahem, manly bonding is hardly unheard of in pop culture, the relationship between two brothers, particularly those of similar ages, are still unique, and too often ignored in our romance-obsessed world. Dean has always been the more likable of the two, as Sam is usually too whiny, but Sam has slowly gained more depth as the show progressed. While Padalecki and Ackles both initially struck me as somewhat vapid hunks, they've both proven to be effective leads and both provide some of their best work this season. Indeed, after this season Ackles's cocky and jokey but also committed and loyal Dean has cemented his position as one of my favorite TV characters.

With all the developments in the central story, the conventional monster-of-the-week and comedy episodes are still atypically strong. Previously the humorous episodes tended to be weaker, but now we have some first rate examples in the requisite B&W horror tribute ""Monster Movie"" and the oft-hilarious malevolent wishing well episode ""Wishful Thinking."" They also find some new twists on the monster angle, including the disgusting cannibalistic manbeast the Rougarou in ""Metamorphosis,"" the murderous Siren (yes, like in Greek mythology . . . kinda) in ""Sex and Violence"" and a classic bit of magician-oriented horror in ""Criss Angel is a . . ."" Kripke and company also don't hesistate to take the show in bizarre directions, as in the ""Back to the Future"" style ""In the Beginning,"" where Dean meets his youthful parents and ""It's a Terrible Life,"" where Sam and Dean have inexplicably lost their pasts and identities, and instead work in a seemingly generic office. The season has no real throwaway episodes, always maintains the level of stylish eeriness that defined the show, and manages to step up the gruesomeness and intensity a bit from time to time. (""Family Remains"" and the vicious ghoul epic ""Jump the Shark"" are both particularly nasty.)

The final few episodes concerning the central story are perhaps not as strong as I would've hoped considering how compelling the season had been previously, but the conclusion still leaves me with great expectations for season 5. I fear that it may well try and be to big, if you understand my point, but the rock solid nature of this season give me reason to hope that they can pull it off. If they can maintain this level of quality for another season and if 5 is indeed the end, Supernatural will likely vie for the title of the best supernatural/horror TV show ever.

All in all, this is a terrific season from what is, with the end of The Shield, my favorite show currently on the air. Anyone with an interest in horror-oriented television needs to check this out, from the beginning.",1247443200,8,5424,5.194285714285714
3571182,5,B001FB4W0M,"Season 4 has been phenomenal. The season finale was incredibly good. I really was worried when they brought angels and the idea of God into the mix but they did it tactfully and it made for a great storyline and good episodes. Special effects are good, I can't wait for season 5. This is one of the best if not the best show on television.",1247184000,,339,4.230769230769231
3571183,5,B001FB4W0M,"After a mildly entertaining third season, Supernatural came roaring back with its best season yet.  The show has also evolved in a number of ways.  It is now more serialized.  It is no longer only about two brothers driving around the country in Impala, with classic rock blasting, and fighting monster of the week.  Episodes are more interconnected as the overall story revolves tightly around the coming battle between angels and demons.

The story also turns much darker as the two brothers struggle with inner demons: Sam's addiction to demon blood and power, and Dean's guilt over what he was driven to do in Hell.  The two young actors have stepped up and met the demands of the roles, though the new actress for Ruby seems bland and out of place acting at opposite side of them.

The battle of angels and demons is no ordinary black and white affair.  We learn that God is forever silent, and that some angels are shady and would not hesitate a second to sacrifice human lives for a ""greater"" cause.  Lucifer was formerly an angel.  ""Fallen"" angels may or may not be ""evil"" in Supernatural's universe.  I marvel at how successfully the creator and writers of the show explore the Christian themes and myths.  There are countless references to the Bible and Milton's Paradise Lost, and echoes of Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials.  In so doing, the season goes beyond popular entertainment to the realm of serious fantasy.

I recommend anyone new to the series to watch the first three seasons, and then stay in sequence for season four.  For long term fans of the show, watch the season again.  It is that good!",1247011200,11,1620,4.711743772241993
3571184,4,B001FB4W0M,"Don't be scared off by the show being on a network not known for quality (the CW), or by the overheated fans who scream for the show's two handsome stars.  Just as Battlestar Galactica was handicapped by being on the Sci-Fi channel's otherwise lousy schedule, Supernatural doesn't seem to get the mainstream coverage that it deserves while being broadcast on the CW graveyard.  It's one of the scariest shows on television, and among its strengths, features some elements that rarely are successfully merged into one show:  scares, creatures, humor, an engaging ongoing storyline, and most importantly, show runners that bring sharp writing skills to the table.  I love the show's ""backwoods America"" setting, and the haunted houses and creepy woods that populate it.  I'm not a huge ""classic rock"" fan, but enjoy the way they've merged some classics into the show's soundtrack. If you're even slightly interested in any of these things, go rent the first couple of episodes from Season One on DVD and see for yourself.

3571188,5,B001FB4W0M,"then you are missing the greatest thing to happen to network television, EVER.  I was a huge fan of buffy so when i saw that the same network was coming out with another supernatural drama i was very excited. I watched the first four or five episodes when it first came out and wasn't immediately impressed.  It seemed like they were just going to find some random evil to monotonously overcome every week with little attention to an overall story line so i stopped watching. Man was I wrong, and its rare that I'll admit that. Sometime during the third season a friend of mine convinced me i needed to be watching. Remembering that buffy didn't start out so great either i gave in and put the first two seasons on my netflix cue. Since watching the episode ""Home"" I have been absolutely hooked, which was ironically right where i had originally stopped watching. This was before i discovered hulu so bought each individual episode i had missed from season three from itunes. And i would do it over and over again if i had to, without regret.

I have since then bought the first three seasons on dvd and loved rewatching every episode. I can see this being something i could rewatch every couple of months or so and never get tired of it. The writing is amazing, the effects are way better than you would expect from television and you couldn't ask for better actors (Jenson Ackles is downright delicious). It really has gotten better and better with every season. I'm starting to wonder wether eric kripke sold his soul at the crossroads. I guess if he had more people would be watching.

So take my advise and buy all the seasons, watch them, then start telling your friends how much you love it. It would be a damn shame if this show didn't continue to stay on the air because not enough people gave it a chance.",1244592000,3,1815,4.490909090909091

Just two of the highlights of this season are Dean screaming like a scared little girl at a kitten, (he'd been infected with a virus) and Jensen Ackle's performance in the scene where he tearfully tells Sam about what he went through in Hell. I was glad to see Bobby back again. Basically all of the cast knocked it out of the park this season, as well as the writers and other crew on the show.
So as for season 5, I have no idea how they will top Lucifer rising up from Hell, but I know they will! At the end of each season I always say they will never top this, but they always do. I'd have to say right now this is my favorite show on tv; it has the most imagination and the wildest plot twists and turns, but it's still easy to follow along. I'm glad their ratings have increased this year, they really deserve it. This is one of the most unfairly underrated shows on tv. If you like the show as much as me, it's your duty to get someone else hooked on it! That shouldn't be too hard.",1244505600,2,1409,4.071942446043166
3571190,4,B001FB4W0M,"Speaking as someone who has been with Supernatural from the get go (and loving every minute of it) I'm just as excited as all the fandom at the upcoming release of the DVD box set for Season four.  This show has always been a five star series for me.  The only reason I'm not giving it a five here is because I'm waiting to see if the DVD release of Season four has all of the extra features I'm hoping for.  Season three was disappointing in that it had less episodes than usuall but I was also disappointed in the lack of good episode commentary and behind the scenes stuff.  I know alot of people don't care for commentary but if it's done right you can really get alot of new insight into a show and learn about things you didn't already know.  Aside from the regular director/cast commentary, I'm really hoping to hear more commentary from the writers and effects crew as well as some of the supporting cast members like Jim Beaver or Misha Collins.  A special homage to Kim Manners would be nice.  Also some effects reveals (like how did they get Sam to roll around on that wall in ""when the Levee Breaks""?)  What can I say, I'm a sucker for behind the scenes reveals.  I'm sure the gag reel in this season will be really awesome.
  This show has truly been a credit to Erik Kripke's genius.  It's very difficult to come up with a solid plot line to last five seasons but boy has he delivered.  Add to that, the strong team of writers and an amazing cast (whoever casts for this show should get an award!!).  I find it more kismet than coincidence that the two stars of this show are not only both from Texas but are both middle children in families of a younger sister and older brother.  These two guys were destined to find their way into each others lives as actors and friends and it really shows in the chemistry they share on screen.  I can't wait to see what happens next season and what kind of extras are on the DVD set for Season four.  I'm happier than a puppy with two persqweeters!",1244332800,,2001,4.293333333333333

Season 4 was a hard one; it kept you on the edge of your seat every episode.  I was getting kind of mad when Sam and Dean started drifting apart there.  The bond these two guys show while on their everyday mission, is one of the things that makes this show so great.  So when in Season 4 they started drifting apart, with Dean displaying his usual follow in his father's demon hunting steps routine and Sam slowly starting to act like a demon/not demon self, I was beginning to wonder where the show was going.  But thankfully, in this season's last episode with the rise of Lucifer, it looks like Sam and Dean are going to start acting like the brother's we fan's love and stick together to fight off whatever Lucifer may bring.  Anyone who hasn't seen this show, needs to hurry up and buy the previous seasons and sit down and watch, because I know that once they do, they won't be able to stop watching and in fact, will probably do what I do, re-watch over and over again until Season 5 airs.  Can't wait for the next season.  I'm so excited!!!  Keep up the great acting Jared and Jensen!",1243728000,,1243,4.337662337662338
3571253,5,B001FB4W0M,"When The X Files went off the air, I thought I would never find anything else to like as much as I did it. Supernatural fills that spot, hands down. It is my favorite series on television now and I'm always afraid it is going to be cancelled. Usually anything the least paranormal gets the kiss of death except for a select very few.

This season the angels are brought in. This is where my problem comes in. As I said, I love Supernatural, but the angels are portrayed as beings as evil as the demons and God seems to be an uncaring deity. As a Christian, this bothers me. I keep hoping an explanation is forthcoming  and that the series isn't going to continue portraying God in this light.

Without giving anything away, I just want to say I thought the last 2 episodes were awesome. I can't imagine what the next season is going to be like and just wished it would hurry up and get here. I also wonder what is going to happen to Sam and Dean's relationship. I love the brotherly love they share and just hope they continue to be there for each other. The brother I am partial to is really going to need moral support from the other.",1243468800,2,1136,4.25
3571254,5,B001FB4W0M,"I can't wait until the release of the Season 4 DVD set!
I worship Eric Kripke! He and the team went all out this season! I was shocked, surprised (lesser form of shock), devastated and amazed. Season 4 wasn't as lighthearted as the first 3 seasons. I broke out my box of tissue often as I watched Kripke and Company tear the brothers apart, beginning with Sex and Violence. The following 8 episodes were just as brutal as the wedge between the boys deepened and the evil seemed undefeatable.
This show is well written, well acted (love Jensen & Jared) and well delivered. The emotional roller coaster ride that it took me on was almost too much to take toward the end of the season. I need an intervention, but if offered a trip to Supernatural rehab, I would have to refuse. This is the best television series ever! Nothing comes close to this.

3571256,5,B001FB4W0M,"Supernatural, season 4 makes up for the 17 episodes of season 3 (thanks WGA people!)with a full 22 episode run. This is a rare gem of a show where I find myself rewatching a season every 3-4 months (never, ever boring). Seriously, this show has become something of a religion and has re-introduced me to classic, old school rock from the likes of AC/DC & Grand Funk Railroad.

Outstanding episodes here include: In The Beginning (where we see a smoking hot actress called Amy Gumenick as a young Mary Winchester); Metamorphosis; After School Special; Jump The Shark (which was Eric Kripke's in-joke about Chad Michael Murray being a third Winchester brother and introduces us to a new foe); The Rapture; Family Remains (unusually news topical) and saving the best for last: Yellow Fever, where at the very end, we have Dean Winchester doing his rendition of Survivor's ""Eye of the Tiger"" - believe me, you will watch that scene again and again! It's no wonder youtube get so many hits on it everyday and proves 80s rock DOES ROCK!!

On a sad note, this series marked the passing away of Kim Manners, who was very much a creative force in terms of direction, the overall look and feel of the show. We miss you, buddy - RIP.

As per usual, Jared Padalecki & Jensen Ackles are outstanding as Sam & Dean Winchester. Jensen is very much the Han Solo character who gets to quip funnier lines and pop culture references throughout; whilst poor old Jared has cranked up the emotional steering wheel 3 notches and is a revelation in the process. Fans of Heroes often do the Hiro scrunchy face when he time travels, but for me, I always do the Sam stretching-his-hand-out-before-extracting-a-demon-from-its-host routine. Before long, everyone will be copying it! These two actors have a chemistry I haven't seen since Niles & Frasier Crane. Also have to say kudos to Misha Collins as Cassiel, whom I really got used to, even if he does annoy Dean most of the time!

Whilst watching Shatner & Nimoy in Mind Meld, it was great seeing these legends of screen & TV, discussing their fond memories on Star Trek and personal lives. I hope that one day, we'll get Jensen & Jared doing the same about Supernatural.

PS: Don't be frustrated about the final scene of Lucifer Rising - Eric Kripke is genius personified and trust that he knows what he's doing - especially if season five is going to be the last. It's a classic cliffhanger, but the guessing game is on for what hell Lucifer will unleash!

3571261,5,B001FB4W0M,"Even though season three of ""Supernatural"" was tragically cut short because of the writer's strike, 16 episodes instead of the usual 22, it never came up short. It ended the season with one massive cliffhanger and left it's fans and viewers wanting to race through the summer to see what happened. Dean had to beat the clock thanks to his deal with the crossroads demon, and when the season ended, it left many people wondering how in the world it could continue. What did creator Eric Kripke have up his sleeve?. Will the show ever be the same?. Season four is still currently airing as of this writing, with only one more episode to go. The big season finale. It is sure to be brilliant thanks to an already brilliant season. So, what does season four have in store?. Let's get into it(without being spoilery)....

The basic premise for season 4 concerns Dean Winchester(the continually show stealing Jensen Ackles)and his reappearance out of hell. He and the others will wonder how it happened, who did it, and if it plays a bigger part in something. Brother Sam(Jared Padalecki)has his own demons, all the while the two of them still traveling the highways and back roads of America hunting down evil...with some new help along the way in the form of Castiel(Misha Collins).

Season four of ""Supernatural"" displays the show at it's very best. I have been thrilled and overjoyed with each passing season, one just as great or better than the last, and season 4 has truly elevated the show to another level. The scares, humor, and brotherly drama is all there in full force, but it seems so much more epic. The writers and everyone behind the scenes have thrown everything out there to deliver a whopper of a season. So, what to expect?. The season premiere, ""Lazarus Rising"", is the best season premiere of the show by far. It answers some questions, raises some more, and has a glorious introduction to Castiel. Perfect beginning. Other highlights of season 4 include ""In The Beginning"", which features a great guest appearance by Mitch Pileggi, Skinner on ""The X Files"". It's a great 'Back To The Future-esque' type episode that reveals some new surprises of the Winchester family. And they keep a comin' this season!. A top highlight is the fantastic ""Monster Movie"", a loving homage to the horror movies of the 30's and 40's, complete with the right staging, lighting, music and, best of all, shot in black and white. ""It's The Great Pumpkin, Sam Winchester"" is a very cool Halloween episode. Fans waiting for the show to do an episode on the holiday shouldn't be disappointed. ""Family Remains"" is a classic horror story with a fun twist; ""Afterschool Special"" is a wonderful flashback episode looking at the Winchester bros in, you guessed it, high school; ""Jump The Shark"" is a shocking episode that puts a new wrinkle in the Winchester family; ""The Monster At The End Of The Book"" is just great. What may seem like a stand alone, quickly veers deep into the show and it's ongoing arc this season. The first few minutes are side splitting hilarious as the show takes a 'wink, wink, nudge, nudge' approach at it's own self and the fans. There are many more great episodes and moments, like the return of two fan favorites in ""Are You There God?, It's Me, Dean Winchester"", radical wishes coming true in ""Wishful Thinking"", and so much more. Bigm arc heavy episodes abound in ""On The Head Of A Pin"", ""When The Levee Breaks"", and others. Not a stinker in the bunch.

Season four is filled to the brim with excitement, action, scares, chills, and plenty of new unbelieveable twists, turns, and surprises. It could of all veered off course if it weren't for the incredible Eric Kripke, and all of the amazingly talented people working on the show. Of course, the shows rests on the shoulders of the Winchester boys themselves, Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki. Ackles continues to knock it out of the park and continuously impresses with each passing season. He gets plenty to chew on here. Padalecki really came into his own as Sam in season 2 and has continued to evolve from there. He gets some juicy stuff here in season four and he takes Sam to places we haven't seen before. It turns into some tight drama, and the brother/family drama that the show is so much about is tested throughout the season. Elsewhere, Jim Beaver continues to be a strong asset to the show(and the boys)as Bobby, and Genevieve Cortese takes over the role of Ruby(replacing Katie Cassidy, who I liked better in the role). Misha Collins, as Castiel, is a wonderful new addition to the show. He has the right balance of mysteriousness with Castiel.

In the end, season four shows a series that is at the top of it's game. Hitting on all cylinders. Supernatural, like Buffy, just grows and grows from season to season, deepening it's story and inner family turmoil, with plenty of shocking surprises and twists along the way. Season four of Supernatural is shocking, brave, brilliant, witty, scary, and exciting. One can only wonder what Kripke and Co. have in store for us for season five.",1241222400,18,5072,4.740656851642129

This is a really great series and I think the folks in charge should be commended for keeping it moving along without getting bogged down like so many other shows have done in the past. Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles are perfectly cast and neither could be adequately replaced, so let's hope nothing happens to make that necessary. Another bonus in this series is the awesome transfer to DVD. I'm watching these episodes on my upconverting player and a 1080-p television and the picture is almost identical to the high-def broadcasts! I haven't seen any other DVD's with this quality of video and probably won't since the folks at Sony are trying to sell Blu-Ray and transfers like these make it unnecessary to switch. The detail in the closeups is astounding, nothing like the blurry and artifacted transfers done to a lot of programs. If you haven't watched these via an HDMI upconverting player you're in for a real treat. The quality has been there since season one and I hope it is still there in season 4. In terms of interest and casting I rate this show alongside of The Invaders, a show I watched during my high school years.

3571311,5,B001FB4W0M,"It's been a while this season since I saw an episode of this show that met the potential of the first few eps this season. This one, ""On the Head of a Pin,"" finally did what a good episode should do:  it developed the characters in meaningful ways and it moved the plot along in a direction that made me want to keep watching for the rest of the season.

The episode isn't perfect; I'm still blown away by how weak Castiel's character is made to look whenever he's engaged in a fight. Someone always has to save him--Dean, Sam, Anna--because he usually ends up about to get his soul scrambled by some nefarious character or other. Why? Why make him look so weak when he is one of the most engaging characters on the show? And there's still the whole issue of twisted logic that rears its ugly head and makes me wonder who's keeping track of stuff on this show. But oh, man--there are some really good things happening this year that require and deserve recognition.

First of all, and I've mentioned this before, Jensen Ackles has developed some acting chops that really stand out and make me want to keep watching even when the episodes aren't up to snuff.  This young man could so easily get stuck in pretty-boy traps; he's remarkably easy on the eyes and his character has a kind of frat-boy playfulness that might match Ackles' own sense of humor and attitude, but he's got RANGE. He does funny, charming, wicked, sex-crazed, and anguished with skill and believability. But it's with the tortured part of Dean's character that  Ackles really shines. You can see it in the line of his body when he's about to come apart emotionally; you can see it in the flaring of his nostrils as guilt and fear begin to rip at him. He plays Dean like a young man with a moral compass that's fierce and burned into his soul but whose own insecurities and self-doubt eat at that morality and make him vulnerable. Dean feels things intensely, and it's a real trick for Ackles to play him without coming across as wimpy, but the man does it, and he does it with skill and believability.

This episode takes Dean into territory that is meant to break him, and at eps' end, he certainly appears to be broken.  I don't want to spoil the plot twists, so I'll say this and end:  even broken and aching for absolution, Dean is a mesmerizing character because of Ackles' performance and his willingness to do whatever it takes to expose Dean's vulnerabilities and his anguish.

Sam's character gets developed a bit more, and we discover some things about him that are disturbing. I won't discuss that at length because it's a huge plot twist, and I don't want to ruin the surprise.

The whole issue of heaven and hell and angels (both fallen and not) gets developed a lot more here, and it's pretty fascinating to me because I find the whole thing thought-provoking.

All in all, and despite some plot probs and my quibbles about Castiel's character, this episode was superb.

Most especially, kudos to Mr. Ackles.",1237507200,4,2992,4.561567164179104
3571372,5,B001FB4W0M,"I highly anticipated the return of Supernatural after the cliff hanger we were left with on Season Three. So far [there's still a couple more episodes of season four which have yet to air] this season has not been disappointing. From the beginning, with Dean escaping from Hell, to this raging war between the angels and demons, this is one action packed adventure and thrilling ride to be on. I have watched this show from it's debut, and it just keeps getting better. I don't want to reveal too much information for those who read this and have not watched SPN, and I also can't comment as much as I'd like because the season has not yet finished. However, I couldn't wait 'til it's completion to fill out a review for it, and I have definitely put this box set on Alert so that I know immediately when it's released this Fall [more than likely]. I can't wait to have these episodes on DVD to rewatch and relive. I highly recommend this show to anyone; this season stands so far to be the best of SPN yet.

Then in season 2 finale Sam died and Dean made a deal to bring him back to life if Dean would go to hell. I can't wait until Season 4.,1232323200,3,382,4.175675675675675

With real characters we can care about and amazing situations that are rendered believable by the down to earth dialogue and event progression, this is a groundbreaking show. Gritty, real, and chock full of amazing effects this series is a must see for any Sci-Fi or Horror fan or anyone who is interested in being entertained. Written with a nod to the intelligence and humor of its audience I cannot rave enough about this series, every season keeps improving on the last and continuing the entire overall arch of the Winchester's with the legitimacy of any other genre.

Since they are in the 4th season, I recommend watching ""In the beginning"" first, it will at least bring you up to speed on the history of the Winchester boys.

3571444,5,B001FB4W0M,"I have been with the Supernatural series since day 1 and I have yet to be disappointed. For those that have been with the show this long or have knowledge of the occult/supernatural, you will see the correlation of things as the plots build upon each other. The writers have done research and though for society sake have to change a few ""truisms or myths"" to make acceptable tv viewing for the masses they are really cutting edge close to alot of supernatural beliefs/superstitions and knowledge. A good reason that they play the intros from past seasons before the current show is to set up the correlations. As for the actors,GREAT choices on the Winchester boys--they play well into the whole good boy/bad boy thing being soft and harsh as the plot calls for.",1227657600,2,763,4.701492537313433
3571445,3,B001FB4W0M,"Oh, boy. I love this show, and I had trouble respecting this episode.

It's a disjointed, quickly-thrown-together, crappy episode. It hurts to say that about one of my favorite shows, but there you go.

Negatives:
1) the Ruby character--oy. Where to begin. Will she ever really be more than a prop? I don't know. But she isn't more than a prop in this episode. She feeds  Sam some lines that help shape later bits in the episode, but otherwise, she does a lot of screaming and bleeding and not much else.
2) Castiel and Uriel--they are wasted here (although Castiel actually is a plus in some ways--see below). They come for Anna, ostensibly to kill her, and they of course encounter resistance from the menfolk, who just don't get that these angels aren't all warm and cuddly and. . .well, angelic. No, they have a mission, and sometimes the stuff they gotta do is horrible. Why is this surprising to the Winchester men? I dunno. Anyway, these two angels get short shrift here, and it's annoying that Castiel, in particular, gets used that way. Also--what's up with the whole Alastair-can't-be-killed thing? Does that mean he's better than an angel of the Lord, or what? Utter confusion. So--these guys get used in the plot line, and all that happens as a result is that the viewer gets utterly confused. Perfect.
3) The whole plot line is convoluted and filled with happenings that don't make much sense. Pamela comes back to help Anna figure out what's really in her head that she can't remember, but that comes from left field. And almost everything that happens here seems disconnected. Maybe it's that so much is left kind of unexplained, and the show won't be on again until January, so eh? I'm confused, unsatisfied, and basically left to be so for another two months. Fantastic.

Good stuff:
1) Jensen Ackles. He's been kicking acting butt for two years or more now, and he just gets better and better. This guy knows how to make Dean vulnerable, and his willingness to just put Dean Winchester out there and let him be human and flawed and in deep, deep pain, with all the acting challenges that comes with--well, kudos to you, Jensen Ackles. You are superb. From the way your face can show childlike glee (think the ""Mystery Spot"" episode) to the way your eyes can actually go blurry and your face seem to crumple in on itself from guilt and self-loathing. Oh, yeah. The last scene in this episode is a perfect example of what I mean. Every muscle twitch, the way you refuse to stop those tears--a long time coming, they are--to just overflow, and the way every single emotion is just. . .THERE. Awesome. Someone give this man an Emmy.
2) Castiel--like Jensen Ackles, Misha. . .what's his last name? Huh. Can't remember. Anyway, the guy who plays Castiel. He can convey so much with just a subtle shift in expression. At one point, when Anna realizes that Dean has given her up to Uriel and Castiel in order to save Sam from death or a quick toss into the pit of Hell, she turns to Dean and tells him she understands and forgives him. The camera pans to Castiel a couple of times, and the longing in his eyes (for the human emotions that angels aren't supposed to feel or enjoy having) as well as the respect he has for Dean and the decisions he makes at risk of his own sanity and happiness--all there on this guy's face and in his eyes. Good job here, too.

Those are the only two positives I can see in this episode, but they were enough to keep me from giving it one or two stars.

Hopefully the new episodes in January will return with the quality of the first four or so of this season.

Again--someone give Mr. Ackles an Emmy or a People's Choice or something. Wow.",1227312000,2,3683,4.537650602409639
3571446,4,B001FB4W0M,"(Not that there's anything wrong with cliffhangers.)

In this one, the Winchester brothers encounter Anna, a woman who is, as Dean points out and I paraphrase, ""tuned in to Angel Radio."" Anna can hear the angels talking, and she's hearing all this chatter about a coming apocalypse. She also hears a lot about Sam and Dean (aka ""THE Dean,"" a label that makes Dean just a wee bit uncomfortable and makes Sam roll his eyes, since he's not a fave of said angels), and because she can hear these angels, she's become someone the demons want to have in their possession (what better than your own personal ""radio"" to tell you what God's angels are planning?) and the angels want to kill (what's worse than someone who can reveal all your plans to the dark side?).

The part of this episode that I really want to see expanded out is the encounter Dean has with Alistair, who apparently had a mighty fine time torturing Dean in Hell. Hmmm. . .I want the rest of this story.

As I think I've mentioned in at least one previous review somewhere, Jensen Ackles is kicking acting bohiney this year (he did a mighty fine job last year, too), and it's good that his time in ""the pit"" is finally being addressed because if anyone can blend angst, humor and soul-crushing pain in one episode, it's Ackles.

3571450,4,B001FB4W0M,"This episodes finds the Winchester brothers battling to keep another one of those pesky keys from opening and moving the world that much closer to becoming hell-on-earth.

It's a good episode, but not as good as the first three of the season. Still, Castiel is back (yay), and we get some more references to what Dean went through during those 4-months-that-seemed-like-40-years in Hell. I'm hoping that gets developed a little more quickly, as it's a good source of tension and suspense.

In this one, the tension rests there as well as with Castiel (this time accompanied by Uriel, a snarky and maybe-a-wee-bit-prejudiced angel that Castiel calls a ""specialist,"" which you should maybe read as ""homicidal maniac"") and his own doubts over the course of events. And let us not forget the tension between Dean and Sam when it comes to Sam using his ""talents.""

Good job with this one.

Now, word to Mr. Kripke--Ackles and Padalecki have definitely hit their stride as actors, and now's the time to really blow the audience away with some heavy-duty plot and character development.",1225497600,,1079,4.977777777777778
3571451,5,B001FB4W0M,"I'm going to start with a caveat videor (""viewer beware"", in my horrendous Latin. To quote Harry Dresden: ""Darn correspondence course.""): the story deals with the somewhat gruesome origins of Hallowe'en, at least according to the Romans' account of Samhain (which may be biased or exaggerated to make the ancient Celts seem more brute-like), and the Big Bad of the week is a powerful demon named Samhain (pronounced ""Sam-hain"", not ""sow-WHEN"" like the Pagan/Celtic festival).

Aside from that, another top-drawer episode in a season that has been taking this series to greater heights. A new angel has joined Castiel, one Uriel, who gives me a definite ""bad cop"" vibe to Castiel's ""good cop"". The atmosphere is terrific, and the conversation between Castiel and Dean gives us an insight into both characters as they continue to evolve, as well as how angels work in this universe. It's nice to see angels cast in a very different light than what we're used to. These are not Martha Williamson's kinder, gentler angels, these guys are closer to what angels are really like: powerful beings in the middle of a war with the powers of darkness.",1225411200,2,1140,4.9375
