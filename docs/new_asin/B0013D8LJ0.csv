3104745,5,B0013D8LJ0,"I got this video from Netflix and I liked it so much that I purchased a copy from Amazon to send to an old friend in the construction business,  He enjoyed it so much that he watched it a second time, with his adult children.

  The Seven Wonders are huge construction projects, ranging from the Panama Canal to a lighthouse off the coast of Scotland, built on a rocky island that is under water 20 hours a day.  This lighthouse still stands and functions 200 years later.

  The several hour long BBC production is broken into manageable segments on each of the seven projects,  I personally found the lighthouse episode the best, and the only one I would skip is the piece on the building of the huge British ship the name of which escapes me.  For the most part the men, and in the case of the Brooklyn Bridge a woman, who had the vision to begin and the unwavering courage to complete these epic projects make for fascinating watching.

Compelling viewing to be watched more than once.",1308528000,5,989,4.4692737430167595

3104747,4,B0013D8LJ0,"I really only got this for the Hoover Dam portion. However, the Bell Lighthouse Tower and the London Sewers were a delightful surprise. Who would try to build a lighthouse eleven miles out to sea and expect to be successful? Well, it is still there today!

The interesting part about the London Sewers were how the egg-shaped design of the tunnels made the sewers self-cleaning. Maybe India should learn a lesson, as the youth that they employ to hand-clean their sewers continue to become very ill, due to the work.

The Hoover Dam portion did a pretty good job of making it seems as though the dam had not yet been built.

I just wish James Cameron would do a movie on Hoover the what with the depression, high unemployment, Ragtown, Boulder City, men surviving being washed down the diversion tunnels.

For the price, this DVD is well worth getting.",1251331200,2,852,4.66

There are many heroes long dead who deserve our admiration and thanks.  Three cheers for the engineers of the world.  They have indeed richly improved our lives.  Sadly, however, they are normally ignored.  I particularly enjoyed the segment regarding the construction of the London Sewer System.  One is also encouraged to read W.

3104751,5,B0013D8LJ0,"This is a great set of shows. It is almost 100% dramatic re-creations but very well done. It is put together as if modern documentary film crews were on the scene for the creation of these impressive engineering marvels. The acting is first rate and other than the occasional use of an obvious CGI effect the re-creations are very well done. If you enjoy reading about how these monumental engineering feats were done you will enjoy ""seeing"" parts of it on this video. This is all based on factual information an often truth is stranger than fiction. I wish the BBC would do additional shows of the same type for DVD release.",1216512000,8,625,4.589285714285714

8250322,4,B0013D8LJ0,"If you like engineering and/or American history then this is the perfect DVD. I was only interested in two episodes- the building of the Brooklyn Bridge and the Transcontinental Railroad (seriously, who cares about London's sewer system?). What I like about the DVD is that since it the episodes were reenactments, you could actually visualize the events. Most historical DVDs only have a narrator and old pictures on the screen.

The Brooklyn Bridge episode told the story of how the Roebling family overcame adversity and corruption in the construction of the bridge. John Roebling died in a tragic accident and his son Washington Roebling became an invalid after he suffered from the bends disease. His courageous wife Emily took over the project and was instrumental in its completion. My only complaint is that the engineering aspects of the episode was rushed. For example, they never explained how the massive towers and the actual span were built. They should've added another 10 minutes to the episode in order to do so.

The Transcontinental Railroad episode told the story of how the men constructing the railroad had to endure snowstorms, physical barriers (i.e. mountains), and attacks by Native Americans. This was another interesting episode.

Parents, I have to mention one disclaimer: some of the scenes are gory and macabre. For example, in the Brooklyn Bridge episode, John Roebling's foot is amputated. The Transcontinental Railroad episode has a scene in which some of the men are maimed by the Native Americans. This may be too much for young kids.",1526515200,,1570,5.125
