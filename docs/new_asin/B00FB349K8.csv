After watching this, I was left thinking about it for days... That is the sign of a quality movie.",1501977600,,247,4.511111111111111
8613988,5,B00FB349K8,"WHAT A GREAT FILM

Watched on indiepix, came across it on the subway ads. Had to share with you Amazonians:

Very strong story. It's refreshing to see how a low budget film can drive it home due to an amazing story. Brings me back to the golden days of 70's & 90's indie cinema. Even though it deals with some serious subject matter (homegrown terrorism), it still maintains a sense of humor and humanity that you can relate to. The actors are great, lots of chemistry. This film is a love letter to New York.

Put aside your high chase, SFX, studio films for a night. Be adventurous & watch this film, you won't regret it.",1500854400,,623,4.353448275862069

8613990,5,B00FB349K8,"I got this thinking it was going to be a documentary, what I got was so much more. While some of the film is in a documentary style it easily transitions to a delightful story about the difference between love and loyalty.

The characters were really fleshed out well and Kenny wade Marshall gives a bone chilling performance.

The director must have watched a lot of Miami vice growing up because the execution of film direction was very Michael Mann esque, but more like season 3 than anything.

It's cold exterior and warm interior gives it a well balanced feel and understanding into the psychology of someone who doesn't know his place in the world and the torment one must go through when manipulated.

It's very harsh and gritty which adds to this being a reality more than just a film.

I highly recommend this film it's well worth he money.",1389571200,4,849,4.596026490066225
8613991,5,B00FB349K8,"""American Bomber is a terrifyingly accurate portrayal of the psychology of a would-be domestic terrorist. The story is chillingly plausible and the performances have such humanity that it makes it an incredibly compelling film to watch.""
