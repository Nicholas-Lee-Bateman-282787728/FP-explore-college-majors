173448,5,0967830206,"This is one of the most fun, high energy and hot Latin music exercise videos I have ever seen. I don't even feel exhausted afterward, I just feel exhilarated and I've learned some new dance steps.",962755200,4,196,4.472222222222222
173449,5,0967830206,"I really enjoyed this exercise video because the rhythm and the instructor made me want to dance! I learned cool dance steps that I can use. Finally, there is an easy Latin rhythm class to follow in your home!",961718400,7,209,4.384615384615385
173450,5,0967830206,This workout was fun!  Elise shows you how to do basic steps for first timers.  It was easy to follow and enjoyable.  I am going to continue using to to tone and firm up.  VIVA areobics!,961545600,3,186,4.083333333333333
173451,5,0967830206,"I recently tried this video and it's a great workout.  It's hard not to get excited while watching it.  My 17 year old niece loves it too, especially learning the new dance steps.  It's about the right length and challenging enough to do over and over.",1093564800,9,252,4.434782608695652
173452,5,0967830206,"I'm always looking for a new twist for my workouts.  I recently borrowed this from a friend.  I liked it so much, I bought my own.  Elise has such a great energy level and enthusiasm, that you can't help but move along with her.  It's a good pace and a great workout!  The latin theme is great and you don't have to be a dance expert to figure out the steps.  I know there's a Spanish edition, too.  I hope she makes another one soon!",1092528000,7,434,4.035294117647059
173453,2,0967830206,"The ""Latin"" moves in this workout seem strangely like American aerobics to me.  You can work up a sweat by adding a lot of intensity to the moves, but if you're interested in Latin dance, my advice is to buy Brazilian Dance Workout with Vanessa Isaac instead.  This workout just isn't as energetic and fast-paced as it looks.",1088640000,6,325,4.586206896551724
173454,2,0967830206,"I read great reviews and got excited to have fun with latin beat and dance steps.
Unfortunately, it is a basic aerobics workout to generic, uninspiring music.
I wanted something different and this wasn't it. I bought four various DVDs or VHS  together and this was the worst one.
You will sweat, but it is not a dance cardio workout. Just your average aerobics class.",1088208000,4,367,4.6461538461538465
173455,5,0967830206,"I do not like aerobics, but I really needed to do some cardio workout, so I found this, and really, IT IS A GEM! The workout is based on very easy Latin dance steps, so it is much more fun than doing plain floor or step aerobics! And you don't need to be a dancer to use it! It is great fun! Try it!",1082505600,2,299,3.6875
173456,4,0967830206,"Lots of pep, lots of hip, a nice cardio for a beginner or intermediate level.  Dance steps can be learned in one or two sessions.
I recommend it to anyone who hates to exercise, but loves to dance.",1080777600,5,197,4.184210526315789
173457,4,0967830206,"I got this from the library and loved it from the first time I did it, so I had to buy it!  The moves are easy to follow and Elise has the cutest accent!  Yes, it's true that the background dancers aren't that enthusiastic and one does look bored, but I don't focus on them.  I focus on following the music, swaying my hips and working up a sweat!  This is a great workout if you just want to dance!",1077062400,3,399,3.95
173458,4,0967830206,"This is a good 45 minute workout, although I usually like to go an hour.  Elise is an easy-to-follow instructor with a nice body, charming personality, and sexy moves - the qualities which make Brazilian dancers and dance instructors so beloved of all of us.  The stretching on the mat at the end is also a good feature.  Unfortunately the music is uninspiring.  It seems to attempt to be generic, but mambo, cha-cha, samba, lambada, etc. all have their own distinctive rhythms.  Elise changes from one type of dance to another every four steps or so, but the music does not match.  It would be better to build this video around 4, 5, or even 10 minute segments, each with a particular dance and the proper music, as is done in the Zumba videos.",1066953600,5,745,4.522388059701493
173459,5,0967830206,"This workout is really fun!  Elise can really move it.  The others people in the video are more average ability, which is a better benchmark for me to watch sometimes.  The steps are great and Elise shows how to do them in slow motion at the beginning of the tape.  I'm sweating during the workout - it gets my heart rate going and the time just flies by.
I'm hoping that she makes a new video soon!",1062720000,3,399,4.142857142857143
173460,2,0967830206,"The amature dancers which accompany the lead are cute the first viewing then distract, detract, and are annoying by the 3rd time around. I did not like this video but I'd love to see this charming lady make another with varied routins because she *can* dance! Here, tho, she gets bogged down by too many dancers and too little excitement.
It looks good, should be good, but it isn't. The routines and music stay at a constant, flat sameness so there isn't much interest, it's not sexy or fun, and you tend to want to pick fault with it constantly as you dance (or I did). I see many people enjoyed this tape which is a surprise. I did not. It's about 6 on the difficultly level, so that's not the problem; perhaps it was just a bad day the day they filmed it. It lacked joie de vive for me. However -- it IS a thousand times better than Kathy Smith's Latin Workout. Save your money and break down the moves in a Britney video -- it's a lot more fun. Here's to wishing Britney had a work out DVD...",1037664000,6,997,4.225130890052356
173461,5,0967830206,"This has quickly become one of my favorite workout videos.  The music is simply infectious, as is Elise's enthusiasm.  Elise Foss is graceful and certainly has ""got rhythm"" and it's really a lot of fun to follow her moves, learning the authentic Latin dance moves while losing weight - and believe me, you are burning those calories - this video gets you sweating!
This video is the Spanish version, but even if you aren't fluent (as I am not), you can still easily follow Foss's cues and pick up some new vocabulary.  And, hey, that's another bonus!  I mean, why just lose weight, when you can lose weight and practice your Spanish so when you get that body you want you can take that trip to Acapulco and look great at the beach?!  Not to mention, know how to salsa when you get to the nightclub?",1036108800,8,798,4.438356164383562
173462,5,0967830206,"This is a great fun workout, which turned a confirmed exercise-hater into someone who could it every other day. The music is also great, which helps.",1027987200,7,149,4.769230769230769
173463,5,0967830206,"Elise Foss is entertaining with contagious enthusiasm.  This tape will give you a fun workout.  This is highly recommended for those who want to add a latin flair to their workout, work up a sweat...and learn a few Latin dance moves.",1027209600,3,233,4.658536585365853
173464,4,0967830206,"She's a great instructor and this is just plain fun.  Though it is a fatburning session rather than an all out cardio session.  I managed to do the whole thing first time, but I did have a good sweat up.  I intend to use it for variety each week along side my other exercise routines
I enjoy her style and personality.
Once you get to know the moves well, you can simply just let go and shake it all about!
Fun way to fatburn!  Perfect if you want to lose weight and have fun while doing it.",1023235200,3,491,4.030927835051546
173465,5,0967830206,"I tend to dread exercising, but love dancing.  I thought I'd try this video to see if I would like it.  After reading the many reviews, I thought it was worth a try.  I loved it.  I actually wasn't wishing it was over with like I do with other exercise programs.  I still have to get a few of the moves down, but even with not doing all of them correctly, I was really working up a sweat.  I did it before dinner and wasn't even that hungry for dinner afterwards (a plus!).",1019001600,5,473,4.032258064516129
173466,5,0967830206,This video is a great workout! The reviewer who said it was in Spanish got the wrong version! There is an English version and a Spanish version. Hope to see more from Elise soon!,1017446400,3,178,4.264705882352941
173467,5,0967830206,This video is a great workout!  The reviewer who said it was in Spanish got the wrong version!  There is an English version and a Spanish version.  Hope to see more from Elise soon!,1017446400,,181,4.264705882352941
173468,5,0967830206,"While I knew aerobic exercise was important, I couldn't find a workout I enjoyed...until now. Through her Viva! Latin Rhythm Workout video, Elise has given me my first positive experience with aerobic exercise. I look forward to each workout, knowing that I will feel great while doing it and feel energized afterward.
The moves are sexy and fun. I love it when Elise says, ""Once more, with attitude!"" or ""Shake anything you find on your way down."" Her cueing is excellent -- I never feel lost. That said, I can't always do a step correctly for the first few times, but I follow her advice to not worry about how I look, and soon I find that my execution improves over time.
Because you can continue to enhance your workout by adding more more arms and hip movements to each step, I think this video will have a long life in my workout routine. After years as a couch potato, it was a big achievement for me to make it through the entire video--I wanted to find Elise and hug her! I'm still working on getting the Samba down, but I'm not so worried about it -- I'm just enjoying the sweat and my new-found endurance.",1000857600,41,1116,4.422330097087379
173469,4,0967830206,"The exercise is low impact and the music is good.  The dancing makes it more amusing than the regular mundane steps.  No one is screaming like the Richard Simmons tapes.  My only criticism is the lack breathing instructions when stretching since I forget when it is best to inhale vs. exhaling.  Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.",970617600,5,338,4.677966101694915
173470,5,0967830206,Great Workout with Rhythm!  Elise Foss is fantastic with her easy-to-follow salsa aerobic.  I use it at home every day and have produced fantastic results in trimming body fat in the right spots.  I love the  rhythm---> RESULTS: I FEEL GREAT and everyone tells me I LOOK GREAT!

7794072,4,0967830206,"This workout requires (at least for me!) both physical and mental agility. I love it. It is fast paced, and sometimes I need to practice particular steps on my own in order to be ready for them.  The routines are well-sequenced.  Warm-up, Aerobic, Mas energia and cool down provide a thorough workout, and I enjoy being able to practice hearing Spanish (English is also an option).",1388707200,,381,4.757575757575758
7794073,2,0967830206,"This is not what I expected.  Elise is high energy buy nothing is put together and it gets confused. You will be better off buying the Crunch Cardio w/Gizelle and or Cal Pozo's Salsa Sizzle. These really get you sweating and you burn calories, lose weight and get that slim waistline.  I am 56 and I feel great doing these videos and my body looks like that of a much younger person. Elise's video is just so so and it is more expensive than the other ones I purchased.  Not a good one to start the day with.  I am sorry I wasted my money.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Viva-Latin-Rhythm-Workout-DVD/dp/B00009XN3V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Viva!

7794074,4,0967830206,"This gal is very good at teaching the steps.  She is pleasant and makes it fun.  I have only been doing Latin Aerobics for a couple of months at the YMCA so this is a good work out for me especially to learn the steps.  The music could be improved upon considerably, but better than just drums as some workouts have.  I also have a more advanced DVD (Carlos Arias - very good) which I will continue with after I feel I have this one down pat enough to not have to think about my steps, but just enjoy the dancing moves.",1258156800,,519,4.0588235294117645

7794076,2,0967830206,The music is bad and so is the dancing.  I donated this to my public library so that people can try it for free before committing any funds to it.  However it is better than no exercise at all.,1149465600,2,193,3.923076923076923
7794077,1,0967830206,"first, I didn't break a sweat, and I would consider myself an intermediate in the aerobic area.  second, the music is not music.  it's someone with a synthesizer hammering out a lame ""latin-esqe"" beat.  I was looking good some fun and inspiring latin music and well this is NOT it. It is sooooo cheesy.  This dvd *might* be good for the VERY early beginner or someone who's trying to learn english as a second language (the dvd is bilingual).  Other than that, I can't see much use.",1142553600,4,482,4.494252873563219
7794078,3,0967830206,"Elise has good natural looseness in her movements, enthusiastic which is infectious. The music is almost elevator music with no interesting points to keep you inspired, actually annoyed me which is rare. It reminds me of music at a carnival/circus. She breaks down the moves better then most dance DVDs, though not perfect & she definitely does not let you take a break to keep the heart-rate up.
There are great mambos, salsas, decent samba, merenges, a few jazz moves & cute hip moves, but even more & way too much step touches, grapevines, v steps & box steps that make it a bit boring for me.
In a bad decision, she used students who had no talent: the skinny blonde looks like an aerobic instructor who moves robotic & does a lot of moves wrong, the one in the back barely moves at all & if does, moves like she's ready to take a nap & the brunette at least has some fluidity & enthusiasm, but needs to work on grace. You have to make sure you don't look at them to make sure you don't mimic their bad forms.
