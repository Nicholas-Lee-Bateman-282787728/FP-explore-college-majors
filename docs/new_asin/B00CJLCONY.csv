5724473,4,B00CJLCONY,"My child love these little boys and she was glued to the TV 5 min after opening the box......... wish it was more concert, but she could care less..... it pretty much is a biography of each boy and how they got in the group and here and there they would show a performance from a concert they've done. So if your looking for a full 2 hours worth of a concert, nope not gonna get it here, but you do get a chance to see them perform in a concert here and there in the DVD..... But my child loved it so i loved it.....",1389571200,,516,3.8773584905660377

The movie put the pieces together for my girls. Extremely satisfied these young men are so sweet and generous and caring young boys.",1376870400,4,288,4.78
5724484,5,B00CJLCONY,"This movie is beyond amazing. It will make you laugh , cry , twerk . Lol
Honestly if your a die hard mindless fan you will understand the need to buy and watch this movie. Dedicated to the four boys that are apart of mindless behavior",1376784000,3,234,4.108695652173913
5724485,5,B00CJLCONY,"As a fan, it's all you would want to see. You see where they came from, how far they went, they're love for the fans and each of their individual personalities in a completely new light. It was cool to see how they make every fan feel special and encourage them to join the mindless movement in being themselves. Seeing them miss their families was sad, and I think the visit to Michael Jackson's house was one of the best parts. Overall, it's like the perfect family or fan movie. Cause no matter what, as said in the movie, u just want to see them win. They're generally good kids and role models. That's why I love them so. :)",1376784000,7,629,4.25

5724489,4,B00CJLCONY,Most of the movie was about their concerts. My daughter wanted to know more about them. What do they do when they are not performing.,1375747200,2,133,4.36
5724490,5,B00CJLCONY,"This movie/documentary was good! My niece & I enjoyed it. She is such a Mindless Behavior fan!! From the music, concerts, and now movie. This boy band will be around for a long time. Wonderful & talented young men!",1375574400,4,214,4.512820512820513

5724492,1,B00CJLCONY,"Let me start off by saying that this type of music isn't my favorite and I'm not the target audience for this DVD. I'm a senior citizen.

Mindless Behavior seems to be an attempt to assemble a boy band ala the Backstreet Boys which will appeal to the hiphop demographic. The members are all pretty talented with lots of enthusiasm, dance moves, etc. Perhaps they can even sing. Hard to tell because most everything is lipsynced and other wise heavily processed. There was one scene where they ""sing"" an impromtu tribute to Michael Jackson that reminded me of the scene in Spinal Tap where ST tries to sing a tribute to Elvis.

The big problem with the DVD is that it's trying to chronicle the groups stardom, when in fact they are little known. None of their songs is memorable. And they go on incessantly about their ""god given talent"" and the fact that it's important to ""keep it real."" All four and their mother's seem to be infected with a bad case of Narcissistic Personality Disorder. I was stunned by the sheer banality of the goings-on.",1372982400,2,1044,4.577540106951871
