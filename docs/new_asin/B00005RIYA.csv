8256660,3,B00005RIYA,"FMW's ""War of Attrition"" is in NOT the classic FMW video you're looking for. All the matches save one have been edited for the benefit of showing the most outrageous, most audacious spots throughout a considerable period of FMW's history (somewhere between 1999 and 2000). Sadly, this editing strips many stars of their presence (I can name many wrestlers here whose potential graces are cut from our sights). Worse, the story is confused once Fuyuki arrives into the scene after supposedly being kicked out.
Highlights
Many ECW stars are featured in this video. The most prominent of them is Balls Mahoney, everyone's favorite chair-swinging freak. Mahoney has been an ECW tag team champ with FMW's own Masato Tanaka, so no wonder he is so highly respected among FMW. Other stars include Tajiri and Super Crazy (who are sadly not shown here in full), Pitbull #1 (who's disappeared from America's ECW since 1998), and even Paul Heyman, the big boss of ECW. Sorry, but Tommy Dreamer and RVD are nowhere to be found.
The top FMW stars are H, Ganosuke and Masato Tanaka. Tanaka plays the big heel who is jealous of H and Ganosuke's friendship and respect. So, Tanaka begins wreacking havoc on FMW by joining ECW. Lots of bloodshed, acrobatics, and smashed noggins abound. This video is definitely for Tanaka fans, since he stars in at least 4 matches in this tape.
H is the legendary man FMW knows best as Hayabusa, except he is unmasked, looking like a Japanese version of Spike from ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"". He knows many many moves, from Fame-Asser to Rockbottom to the Firebird Splash (not all these moves are named, though). Fans of H and Hayabusa will be pleased that both versions of the aerial master can be seen here several times over.
You like tables? Well, in almost every match, someone falls down a table. Sorry, no ladders.
My favorite scene happens close to the end of the tape. In a match where H and Ganosuke are set to fight Tanaka and Mahoney, Mahoney grabs H and spike piledrives him off the ropes! The driver is so effective that H can't get up, and Mahoney is holding his head in utter shock! Mahoney's white expression is priceless, and so is the next scene, where someone carries an unconscious H over his shoulder. This is absurdity at its very best.
Dan Lovranski and John Watanabe, the so-called infamously bad announcers of FMW, do a much better job calling the shots than any other tape I've seen. It's too bad this isn't the best video from FMW.
""War of Attrition"" lacks ""Rule the Asylum's"" complete matches and ""The Enforcer's"" flowing narrative style, and should best be worth a rent for wrestling fans. Other people, beware.",1022544000,,2658,4.755411255411255
