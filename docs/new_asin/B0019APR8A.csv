3430625,5,B0019APR8A,"Great story for the children, however I like the first Kirikou better, as an adult I can watch the first one over and over again.",1377388800,,129,4.2
3430626,5,B0019APR8A,Great animation and stories. Not as engrossing as Kirikou and the sorceress... But these short stories that fill in the first story work well and are entertaining in their own right.,1375315200,,182,4.903225806451613
3430627,5,B0019APR8A,my children and my students are in love with Kirikou. This is a great video and I hope they continue to make more episodes.,1345420800,,123,4.166666666666667
3430628,5,B0019APR8A,"I don't speak French but this move is sooo beautiful, it's worth it.  My kids (7 and 3) also love it and for a movie only with subtitles to keep the attention of young children that don't speak the language that's being spoken is a huge testament to its beauty.",1313366400,,261,4.22
3430629,3,B0019APR8A,"I was so impressed by the first movie, Kirikou And the Sorceress, that I took a chance with this one, Kirikou and the Wild Beast. It has nice scenes, from pottery making to a community garden, and solutions to problems when animals interfere. Yes the art is great, and many of the same characters appear, but the story is not as well developed. I was hoping for more.  I would encourage anyone and everyone to see (purchase) the first movie, Kirikou and the Sorceress.  It has brilliance, incredible art, and most importantly, an amazing story that rises above  the same old moralistic good versus evil. Though the little child, Kirikou has only a short interaction between his wise grandfather, there is such beautifully rendered tenderness and revelation.  Many subjects are  brought to life and dealt with- superstition, foolishness, fear, problem solving, determination and a sorceress who is transformed by the release of pain.  Kirikou and the Wild Beast is a nice movie but nothing like the first Kirikou.",1298160000,,1012,4.994047619047619
3430630,5,B0019APR8A,"I already had Kirikou and the Sorceress, so when I saw this verion I had to get it.  Both are beautiful works of art with wonders moral lessons shown through African life.  I hope to show these cartoons to my grandchildren one day.",1284854400,,231,4.348837209302325
3430631,5,B0019APR8A,"If you've seen Kirikou and the Sorceress, you know about the fantastic artwork that both these movies share.  They're both animated by really excellent artists.  The stories are excellent, too.  Kirikou and the Wild Beast is four short stories that take place between scenes of Kirikou and the Sorceress.  They take place in a west African village, and are children's stories.  Note, however, if you're offended by nudity, that all the characters wear traditional west African dress.  The children are nude, and all the adults are nude from the waist up.  I like it that the animals are animals, not furry humans as they are in so many US animated films.",1283212800,,654,4.837837837837838
3430632,1,B0019APR8A,"I would have appreciated a better heads up that this was in French only.  Now I have a crying 5 year old because she can't read the subtitles quickly enough.  Grrrr.

It's in fine print only, very deceiving, especially since it's called 'Kirikou and the Wild Beast' rather than 'Kirikou et les Btes Sauvages.'

I will be returning this.",1262649600,,336,4.6440677966101696
3430633,5,B0019APR8A,"shipping took way too long. Plus after waiting that
long the beauitiful movie only in french. Not
helpful to me at all. So i had to buy another
one to replace it. Thank for making me waste
my money. The movie kirikou get 10 stars but
the shipper gets nothing from me.",1253491200,,267,4.153846153846154
3430634,4,B0019APR8A,"Our family is a big fan of Kirikou and this one is no exception.  Beautiful animation, interesting stories, and he is his usual clever self -- ""small but mighty"".",1232841600,,162,4.586206896551724
3430635,4,B0019APR8A,"One of the most interesting animated tales I have ever seen on DVD is ""Kirikou and the Sorceress"" - an unqualified 5 out of 5.  That film tells the story of a tiny boy born with magical powers and canny intelligence who defeats a witch in the forest who is capturing the male warriors of a  Senegalese village tribe.

The next movie ""Kirikou and the Wild Beast"" is a sequel and like most sequels it never quite matches the originality of the earlier film. In fact, the magical birth of Kirikou is never explained or referred to. What is the purpose of the next film? It is a collection of short tales of Kirikou's adventures - such as riding a giraffe, outsmarting a powerful hyena, or creating lovely and valuable pottery for the village trading post.

Nevertheless - the new film exceeds the original in one department - glorious animation design. Unbelievable.  The artwork is equal to the best animation anywhere - computer or otherwise. So many of the frames resemble the jungle paintings by the French self-trained artist Henri Rousseau  who stunned the art world in the early 20th century.  And for this alone, I would readily recommend the movie.",1219708800,,1154,4.711442786069652
8273140,5,B0019APR8A,Dvd worked as described.  Original movie was better but not bad,1478131200,,63,4.7272727272727275
8273141,5,B0019APR8A,my son loves kiriku adventures wonderful images for black families...FAMILY MOVIE TIME,1467072000,,86,6.25
8273142,5,B0019APR8A,A kid's must have!! I love watching it too!,1457568000,,43,3.888888888888889
8273143,1,B0019APR8A,Very disappointed. The audio and sub titles are in French. This should be stated...,1431561600,,83,5.0
8273144,5,B0019APR8A,"This motion picture, an inquel set during the story of Kirikou and the Sorceress, between the moment the cursed spring is released and the discussion where Kirikou's mum's reveals to him his grandfather who lives behind the forbidden mountain, contains multiple short stories where Kirikou lives adventures with animals and survives multiple encounters from Karaba. Although certain voices of this film are different from the first one, We can still feel the same magic that was in the first movie. Again, Michel Ocelot reveals to his audience gorgeous images and magnificent scripts.

Wonderful work from a great storyteller whose tales are universal and for all ages. A filmmaker who treats his audience with respect.",1431129600,,719,5.307017543859649
8273145,5,B0019APR8A,Good cinematic quality. A timeless tale that should be more widespread than it seems. Great enjoyment and enlightenment especially for young ones !,1414627200,,147,5.434782608695652
8273146,5,B0019APR8A,"THIS FILM IS ANOTHER FABULOUS GIFT from animator/story teller Michel Ocelet. Only drawback is if your children are not French speakers, they will have to read the subtitles in English. If they are very young, this will not be possible; however, the story is very clear even without the subtitles. If it were also in English, this would be doubly PERFECT!  I highly recommend this BEAUTIFUL animated feature. Also buy KIRIKOU AND THE SORCERESS!!!! (That one is in English so you won't need the subtitles if you're not fluent in French)",1401753600,,534,4.868131868131868
8273147,5,B0019APR8A,"The films by Michel Ocelot are stunning in the graphics and animation.  In addition, they all contain lessons about life.  This film was 7 years after Kirikou and the Sorceress.  Because the other was such a hit, he was asked to doing something else with the Kirikou character.  It takes place in Africa.  A wonderful film!",1399334400,,323,4.696428571428571
8273148,4,B0019APR8A,"Good film for students of French, among others, and for children.  Not as good as the first Kirikou film but still entertaining.",1387756800,,128,4.818181818181818
8273149,4,B0019APR8A,Last year my students saw the first kirikou. they loved it so much and asked me if we could see more. I know people did not like the second that much and It is my case too but my students enjoyed it,1384300800,,198,3.738095238095238
