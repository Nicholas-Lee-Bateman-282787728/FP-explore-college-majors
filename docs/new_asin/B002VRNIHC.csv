8382405,3,B002VRNIHC,"""Air Front: The Early Years '39-'42"" is a DVD documenting the early years of WWII in the air in Europe. The video uses period film footage to show the story of the air war in the beginning years of WWII when air forces were having their pre-war ideas and aircraft tested in combat.

The DVD begins by giving a short amount of backstory to air combat, beginning in WWI and moving through the interwar period. It does a fair job of talking about both German and British (though not French, Italian or Soviet) preparations for war in the late 1930's. Briefly covers the German Luftwaffe's birth in the interwar years with aircraft that were clearly stop gap measures like the HE-51 and HS-123 biplanes as well as development that led to the modern types. Covered Britain's attempts to ""catch up"" by fielding the Hawker Hurricane and the Supermarine Spitfire.

It does an ""okay"" job of covering the course of WWII in the air during the first three years of war. The video makes several key mistakes - all too common ones. The DVD states that the Luftwaffe was designed exclusively for tactical bombing and neglected strategic bombing. This is simply untrue since the Germans developed blind bombing devices and techniques which are only useful in a strategic role. The DVD states that RAF Bomber Command was effectively bombing Germany early in the war when this is highly inaccurate since Britain's own Air Ministry looked at the problem of night bombing. The ""Butt Report"" showed that Bomber Command's efforts were almost completely useless since they rarely were able to get their bombs within even 50 miles of the target!

Well, I can't say the production quality of this video was really high. There was no musical score and the narrator couldn't overcome the poor production though I must say that he could pronounce all the terminology - even the German and Italian terms I have heard ""butchered"" in better productions. It's obviously a British production and tends to concentrate on the ""Battle of Britain"" while giving less time to the Norway or French campaigns.

Why do I give such a production three stars? The film footage is very good. Shows Hurricanes and Spitfires in early war guise as well as the German bombers: HE-111, DO-17 (you usually don't see a lot of film of that one) and JU-88. Even more, you get some really good footage (all too short!) of the French Morane Saulnier MS 406, the Italian Savoia Marchetti Sm 79  and some other rare aircraft of the era.

If you're an air power enthusiast, you can ""zone out"" many of the production flaws and keep an eagle eye out for the rare footage! I give this video three stars.",1386806400,,2640,4.728260869565218
