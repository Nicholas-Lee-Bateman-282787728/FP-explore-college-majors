5080655,1,B007FF3HQM,"Like the other reviewers have said, my daughter is a huge fan of Finding Nemo and Turtles: Sammy's Adventures. Anything to do with the water, she loves. So I saw this movie for $10 and bought it thinking we'd add it to our fish collection.

It takes a long time before any ""plot"" gets going, scene transitions are non-existent (just jumps from one thing to another), characters are unlikable and mean to one another, violence and words that I wouldn't expect in a movie that has ""Family Friendly"" stamped on the front, and it was just overall boring and dumb. And then when the ending credits started rolling, I saw ""made by Al Jazeera Children's network"". WHAT?!?!

This movie is going in the trash. I'd feel too guilty selling it to anyone, even for 50 cents.",1350345600,24,761,4.588235294117647
5080656,4,B007FF3HQM,"Probably too complex for Western children, this is a deeply touching and amusing tale! At first it wasn't obvious where the story was going, but I think that's a plus. Told with unleashed imagination, this is a wildly playful and beautifully animated romp. However, one has to question the lesson it attempts to impart, which is a little murky. The whole thing is a complex allegory about living in peace with a predacious bully who terrifies you but who also protects you from ever lurking but unseen threats. One cannot help but think it's a metaphor for U.S. occupation in the Middle East, and if this is the intended message, it's quite sad. Depictions of child abuse throughout are disturbing, and yet these scenes illustrate how the bullied become bullies in turn. The art work, crazy plot twists, glimpses into another culture, and much more make the movie really engaging and well worth watching. Its creators sought to illustrate how industrial waste is devasting wild life, and for that they get many kudos. But if you're showing this to children, you may want to discuss whether it really is preferable to live in close, terrifying proximity to a monster, who won't harm you as long as you satisfy his basic hungers, because he protects you from other real, but unseen, monsters roaming in the wilds, rather than living an unfettered life in which you take your chances with the dangers that lurk everywhere, for everyone. Personally, I'd opt for freedom.",1350259200,9,1466,4.868
5080657,3,B007FF3HQM,Its no finding nemo but the language is not bad unless you're very religious in you're house. Its not the best animation but for 2 bucks used id say its worth it. My 4 year old found it interesting.,1338940800,3,198,4.102564102564102
5080658,1,B007FF3HQM,"The irony is that the cover depicts a harmless-looking scenario and conjures images of that wonderful animated feature ""Finding Nemo"", so of course my seven-year-old, a great fan of FM, asked if we could rent this. I didn't see any harm in it, until we actually started watching it. I make it a point to watch any unfamiliar title with my child, so I can intervene if it is not suitable.

This is clearly not a suitable, feel good type of movie for young children, especially in the 3-5 age group. It has many dark elements and scary scenes that will probably give kids nightmares. The story centers around Pup, a young bamboo shark, who tries to rescue egg sacs poached by humans from a coral reef. His journey is aided by a benign shark and an old sea turtle among others, but is still fraught with many perils.

The animation was underwhelming, and the storyline just didn't mesh for me and it would be even more confusing for a young child. The scenes in the deepest parts of the ocean populated by mean and scary looking sea creatures was just a little over-the-top and of the nightmare inducing kind. Avoid this at all costs!",1338681600,26,1131,4.512195121951219
5080659,1,B007FF3HQM,"I have no idea why they would put this kind of language into a cartoon?!?!  I heard what I thought was 'idiot' and 'go to hell' and I wasn't even watching it--just heard it from the other room.  Needless to say, I sat down and started watching it with my 3 year old, and once what I thought I had heard, was confirmed---the movie went off and will not be played again in our house. And I also agree with another reviewer---it has a very 'dark' theme to the movie.  And the crabs in the dark were very unsettling for my 3 year old who had lots of questions about them.",1335916800,41,567,4.09009009009009
5080660,1,B007FF3HQM,"how low can a movie go? It's dark, onfusing, stupid, aweful acting, slow, weird, and not for children. One of the characters repeatidly beats his children! Enough said!!",1333670400,34,169,5.071428571428571
5080661,1,B007FF3HQM,"My wife and I purchased the DVD Sea Level expecting a Nemo like story, something sweet and full of positive messages. Instead, we found the plot deeply disturbing. The messages were dark and distasteful. We would not recommend this movie for anyone and doubt that it is suitable for children. After viewing the movie we discovered that it was written for and produced by the Al Jazeera  Children's channel which we later found out is part of the Al Jazeera News Network.

5080672,1,B007FF3HQM,"If I were an atheist I would use this video as evidence against God's existence: no good God would allow this dreck to be produced. It would be better to perish in a rain of fire and brimstone. This movie is an abomination of desolation.

It would be difficult to hate a movie more than I hate this one. Lousy animation, lousy script, lousy voice-acting, flat-out offensive on so many levels. I can't believe it has that family friendly label on it.
We started watching it on Prime, I turned it off after about 15 minutes due to the nausea of knowing my soul was getting sucked out of my and my will to live diminished. Luckily for me, my son got a hold of the remote, I didn't have the purchasing blocked with a PIN, and now I own possibly the worst movie ever. Yes, he hit 'resume' and so there's no cancelling the order. I'm so bitter about losing my $11 that I honestly never want to see a TV or the internet again. I'm still working through the Stages of Grief and may seek therapy.
There are not enough cuss words to fully express my anger and frustration at owning this. I hope I get hit by a bus later because I can't unwatch Sea Life. I wish I were dead. It's not the $11--it's the principle. SERENITY NOW!!!

When selecting this film to watch, we went in with an open-mind knowing it would not be on par with Finding Nemo or Sharktale.  The storyline was incoherence for adults, how do they expect children to follow.  My Disney-addict toddler stood up and walked out of the room only 15 minutes in.

I would not let a child under 13 watch it because of the out and out child abuse that is during the times when humans are in the story line.  To me it tells a child it's okay to be abused when you disobey.  At the same thing the sea creatures show them to treat their family and friends good.  Of course there are mean sea creatures.,1469232000,,440,3.898876404494382

5081528,1,B007FF3HQM,"The kids picked this out and I said ""ok"" based on the description. I should have taken 2 minutes to read the review, as this is  most definitely not a kids movie.  There's an abusive male character who swears and beats his children.  There are evil characters in both the sea and human worlds, and the whole film is grim.

Issues around appropriateness aside, the story doesn't hang together well and the writing is really poor.  The animation is second rate.  And the film drags along forever.  It's just bad.

This show is most definitely not in the same genre as other ""fish films"" like Finding Nemo.  I don't recommend this at all.",1465171200,4,635,4.548672566371682

Second, it's produced in conjuction with AL Jazeera Children's channel.

This movie has horrible scripting with one instance of cursing, an old man yells at 2 younger kids and says ""there will be HELL to pay"".
There is also violence and anger interaction between the old man and children also.
This is not something I want my children watching.

It isi supposed to be a children's story like Finding Nemo, but the plot is a bit too complex for kids and it tends to jump around from topic to topic without time given to develop each before moving to something completely different.  My little girl lost interest by the middle of it and had to tolerate me wanting to watch to the end.  The only issue I have with these undersea animated adventures is the air-like mass and viscosity of the seawater the characters zip, zoom, and gesture in.

5081792,3,B007FF3HQM,"Often times we find new animated shows for our children to watch on Amazon Prime and often they are quite good, but this time around we were a little surprised at some of the content. The show starts out in seeming like a good movie for the first several minutes and shows some really neat sea life with really good animation. It didn't look like a cheap, low budget film at all. But after several minutes it shows a shark getting pulled up on to a boat with a fish hook and laying on the deck helplessly while about ten guys with demonic looks on their faces come toward him with machetes in their hands and demonic smiles on their faces. That was a bit disturbing. Then later on we see two boys slapped across the face by their father and told ""there will be hell to pay"" if they didn't meet their fathers wished on a certain task. Anyone who is a parent knows ho impressionable kids are and how likely they are to emulate behaviors they see in show. For this reason we were unpleasantly surprised with the content of this show as the show was made to look like something small children would be able to watch. This may be entertaining if you're an adult or if you have older kids that are old enough to know that these behaviors are inappropriate and have not tendency to emulate them.

My 5-year-old daughter loves this, so that's all that matters, but I was left confused and scratching my head. The biggest question mark is the eel and the crabs, I guess they are supposed to be the bad guys and are at the bottom of the trench. They basically want to get rid of the big shark so they can come out and eat all the fish above. But they never actually come up or do anything. I don't get it.

Also, this does have a part where the shark gets caught by fishermen, and shows a bloody hook in his mouth and people on the boat coming after him with machetes and trying to chop him up. Luckily he gets away. There is another part where a man smacks a kid, it doesn't show it but you can see his hand go up and then the kid says OW!!! and comes out rubbing his face.

You can tell this isn't an American-made movie, as even in the beginning it says ""Al-Jazeera Kids Television."" However my daughter loves it so we've seen it several times. I give it a solid meh.",1463184000,,1082,4.099056603773585

The characters are annoying, the plot is all over the place, some scenes don't even connect, and there's just simply too much unlikable parts to this film. This film is basically that old, ""evil humans vs animals"" movie trope, except much worse. The adult human repeatedly beats his children, and I was disturbed that a movie as ""child friendly"" as this would have child abuse in it! There is so much that makes no sense, and overall left a bad taste in my mouth. Don't waste your time with this movie, even if you could watch it for free. It's a waste, overall.

The log line of this movie should be: ""under water characters go on an adventure ... Oh and robots and chickens"". Sounds fun, but it's not enough to carry a film for 90 mins.

On top of that, I think they ran out of their tiny budget part way through, as there are many scenes that are drawn out, with no dialog, only grunting.

This all said, my son seemed to like it. But make sure you don't have to be in the room too. He did start calling things 'idiots' part way through, not a word we encourage him to use.",1460246400,,615,4.116666666666666

The one part of the movie that I found very upsetting is that in part of the story one of the villians is a man who poaches sharks for his restaurant.  His kids help him poach and when they don't do what he says, he beats them.  That's not really appropriate.  Additionally, the father said to his kids, ""What the hell are you doing?"".  One of the kids calls the other one an ""idiot"" and he retorts with ""shut up"".  The language is not appropriate for kids.  I am willing to overlook a bad plot line if my kids find something entertaining but not poor language.",1456531200,,840,4.326923076923077

5082248,1,B007FF3HQM,"While the pictures are mostly colorful, some of the fish are depicted as sinister to the point of being evil and could be quite scary for some children and induce nightmares. The storyline seemed to be erratic and jumped from scene to scene without quite tying the scenes together and the writing seemed to be poor with the conversation almost feeling like it was trying to fill up space in the movie just to provide some talking between characters without pointing to any clear storyline. I have to admit that I did not get very far in the movie without turning it off. I never got to the middle of the movie. I usually dearly love animated movies of sea creatures (loved FINDING NEMO), but this one was so sketchy in storyline and poor in writing that the excellence in the colorful pictures could not overcome it. The thing that really drove me away was the sinister fish creatures that were depicted in such a way that could frighten children.

Sea Level is a fun movie with awesome animation,fun story,loveable leads,hateable bad guys,and awesome soundtrack. The people in this sound awesome. I love shark tale, I love nemo but this is the best. Warning its rated PG so its NOT for ages 1-5. Its for ages 6-100. But this is a fun film. 10/10
5 stars. Awesome for $5.00. And has vudu copy for on the go at wal-mart.",1393113600,,462,4.202247191011236

After watching it and liking it a lot and realizing that all the negative reviews were not deserved I gave it to my mom so my little 5-year-old sister could watch it. And sure enough she loves it. She's had it for a week and she's already watched it a handful of times. She loves the movie. This just further reiterates my last review. Sea Level is an underrated movie with a lot of undeserved hate. Yeah it might have some creep scenes and one or two scary scenes but its PG, not G! It will have scary, creepy stuff. So now I give it 5 stars up from my previous 4 star rating.",1392854400,,656,4.015267175572519
5082366,3,B007FF3HQM,"Well we all know that Finding Nemo set the standard by which all other underwater CG films are compared and to date, few (if any) have managed to get the formula right.  Beginning with DreamWorks Shark Tale and crossing over A Turtle's Tale: Sammy's Adventures 1 & 2, The Reef (and Reef 2), Dolphin: The Story of a Dreamer and ultimately ending with the abysmal Legend of the Sea; thats roughly the order Id place them in from best to worst but the question becomes where does Sea Level fit in all of this?

To cut to the chase, it ends up coming in closer to the worse side of the list though in all fairness its definitely better produced and certainly more tolerable than the unwatchable Legend of the Sea and actually trumps 20th Century Foxs Dolphin the Story of a Dreamer in most categories as well.  If none of this means anything to you, lets take a look at the film on its own merits for a better understanding of where it succeeds and where it comes up short.

Sea Level comes to us by way of Silver Ant; a Malaysian animation outfit where it was originally called SeeFood and hit theaters in March of 2012.  Working with 40 animators, the team took roughly two years to complete the animation process.  Coming in at a runtime of 92-minutes, Sea Level boasts a very appropriate PG rating for animated intensity and some inappropriate language  parents, take this rating seriously.  Children being called idiots, getting smacked around and the word hell all make appearances here.

The story centers on an unlikely duo- Pup, a young bamboo shark and Julius the intimidating but good hearted oceanic white-tip shark.  Pup discovers egg sacs within his reef while exploring only to be startled by human poachers who show up out of seemingly nowhere and steal the eggs.

Determined to locate and restore the un-hatched shark eggs to their rightful environment, Pup sets out on a ridiculously challenging task, with the aid of Julius, a wise sea turtle, a shady sting-ray and a few other characters, to get the eggs back from the domain of humanity.

While seemingly straightforward a plot structure as a film geared for children should be; Sea Levels greatest crime is that the delivery is incredibly muddled.  Somewhere along the way, we have some good intentions like sharks being more than mindless killing machines, humanity is to blame for the disappearance of a lot of the oceans species, pollution is bad and so on but the trouble is they are so strangely integrated into the story that any value they may have originally contained are filtered right out.
Take for example the ludicrous concept that fish, well at least this one particular bamboo shark, is capable of living on land and breathing air.  In my opinion, this in and of itself undoes 99% of the films message (not to mention all of the research the crew allegedly did to master the movements, behaviors, and mannerisms of the actual animals appearing in the piece).

If this weren't enough, by the end we have the other shark running around in a mech suit, we have an army of chickens hoping the sharks succeed, young kids getting arrested by the police and so on.  In short, it doesnt take much for the whole thing to come unraveled.

Then there are the environmental themes scattered about that really don't make things any better for the floundering prose.  Yes there is a plant shown dumping toxins into the ocean that we occasionally flash to and there is a scene where the sea turtle is struggling to get air on account of the plastic shopping bag wrapped around her head but then were given the subplot that an evil eel and his band of crabs are supporting the pollution as part of their plan for oceanic domination.  Wait, the lesson here is that certain creatures are pro-pollution?

At the end of the day enough plot holes to drive a submarine through mixed with odd pacing that seems more like sequences were simply strung together than it does a continuous narrative will keep Sea Level from ever challenging the dominance of top entries in the genre.

In the plus column, the characters, backgrounds, animations, they're all pretty nice.  Rendering is smooth and clean, particle effects and layering are very well done.  On account of the fact that film, though created in Malaysia, was originally recorded and animated in English means that moth flaps and timing are all spot-on (avoiding the biggest pitfall known to plague imported foreign animated works).

At the end of the day, Sea Level is by no means unwatchable but the beautifully drawn colorful DVD cover-art does little to portray some of the major inconsistencies contained within.  Silver Ant displays a lot of potential, talent and passion in this piece but they would be wise to bring a western consultant on board for future projects should they wish to have a go at the leaders of the animated feature film industry.",1391558400,,4873,4.7249114521841795

5082368,1,B007FF3HQM,"Despite its PG rating, we were swayed by the cover art, description, and ""Family Approved"" seal on the box. Just be warned that it is not for young children.

I don`t find it appropriate for the word idiot and the phrase ""going to Hell"" to flow through the dialogue in a so called family film. All this being said the theme is very dark and it wasn`t a pleasant movie for the older children either. #familymoviefail #wishicouldgetarefund",1368748800,2,479,4.647058823529412

Too much violence to be ""Dove"" approved compared to the rest of the movies they rate. I will never trust Dove ratings again. We couldn't even finish the movie. I think I'm going to have nightmares.

5082373,5,B007FF3HQM,"Sea Level is absolutely gorgeous.  The animation comes pretty darn close to a Pixar level of quality, the characters are interesting and fleshed-out, and the plot is fascinating (once you figure out what's going on).  There's a lovely message throughout the movie about sharks: they aren't mindless monsters, they are simply following their genetic programming, and there are far worse things out there to worry about.  In a day and age where sharks are far too often the villains, its wonderful to see them in a positive light.  And unlike a lot of children's movies these days, Sea Level knows when to slow down, be quiet, and let the characters' expressions tell the story.

Plus, sharks in mecha suits.  Can't go wrong there.

I do notice a lot of the more negative reviews are people who either got this for their toddlers and were horrified by the darker content, or people who simply couldn't follow the story.  To the former, I would like to point out that this movie is rated PG.  There are some creepier moments; such as the human villain slapping his son around, the eel and his spider crab army and one of the shark characters seeing a bucket full of blood-covered shark fins (that scene made ME shiver, and I'm in my 20's!).  This movie is for older kids; remember, just because it's animated doesn't mean it's automatically for the really little crowd.  To the latter, I can't help you there.  The story is pretty complex, with lots of twists and turns and subplots.  Pay attention (and maybe watch it a couple more times) and you might pick up on what's going on.

In short, Sea Level is gorgeous and great for anyone (preferably older than toddler aged) in your family who loves sharks and/or has a great sense of imagination.",1362182400,15,1742,4.668852459016393
