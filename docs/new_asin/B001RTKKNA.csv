3779583,3,B001RTKKNA,"As a child, I can easily remember my prized possession was a Walt Disney book that my father purchased for me and it featured the chronology of the early classic Walt Disney animated shorts.  Some of these shorts were shown on the Disney Channel when I was younger but suffice to say, with all the new animation, a lot of these classics have probably been forgotten or have been released on VHS video.

Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment are now releasing a few of these shorts on DVD for the first time (some have appeared on past Disney DVD releases).  With the first three volumes released, the fourth, fifth and sixth volumes will be released on May 12, 2009.

A lot of these short films were created in the 1920-1940's and typically featured characters that were not reoccurring (with the exception of the tortoise and the hare which appeared in a second short).  Some were released under the ""Silly Symphony"" moniker of animated shorts released between 1929-1939 which rarely featured any character dialogue but focused more on the animation accompanied by music and a singing vocal track.

Walt Disney Animation Collection Vol. 6: The Reluctant Dragon

The ""Walt Disney Animation Collection"" sixth volume features the least amount of shorts than previous volumes but each short featured in this volume is a bit longer in duration than most Walt Disney shorts.  Also, unlike the older and shorter animated shorts, these shorts included in vol. 6 contain dialogue.

  1. The Reluctant Dragon - (20:38) This Technicolor 1994 animated short features a boy who is friends with a dragon.  He finds out that the knight Sir Giles from his village has been sent to kill the dragon and that he should prepare to fight.  But  the dragon is reluctant to fight and prefers to read poetry and train birds to sing.
  2. Ferdinand the Bull - (7:59) A technicolor animated short from 1938 about a little bull in Spain named Ferdinand who prefers to be alone and be amongst the flowers in the pasture and not be with the other bulls.  As he grew older, because he got stung by a bee, he is featured in a public bullfight in which he must fight a matador but once in front of the public, is unable to fight and instead enjoys the flowers around him.
  3. Goliath II - (15:07) A 1960 animated short about Goliath II, a tiny elephant that is not appreciated by his father because of his small stature. His mother protects him though, especially from a tiger named Raja who wants to eat Goliath II.  Goliath II tends to get himself into trouble and is often rescued and scolded by his mother.  Will Goliath II ever earn the respect from his father and the elephant herd?
  4. Johnny Appleseed - (18:41) A 1948 animated short about the legendary Johnny Appleseed who traveled the West with the American pioneers and planted apple seeds during his travel.  Based on the true adventures of John Chapman who traveled the wilderness planting thousands of apple trees.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Walt Disney Animation Collection"" is featured with an aspect ratio of 1:33:1.  These classics are available on DVD for the first time but its important to mention that these animated shorts have not been digitally remastered or cleaned up.

As a matter of fact, you will see a lot of the dust and scratches of the film and some of the animation look fine for being nearly 70 years old but others look grainy and a bit aged.  Granted, these are not classic full featured films but I hope one of these days, many of these classics do get cleaned up or even digitally remastered.

As for the audio, audio is featured in Dolby Digital Surround Sound.  I found that on my home theater system, the best selection on my receiver to view these animated shorts was to switch it to mono or (if you have this capability) select stereo for all channels.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

There are no special features included on this DVD.  But each volume does come with a free collectible litho print.

JUDGMENT CALL:

As mentioned earlier in my review, my prized possession as a child was a Walt Disney booklet that covered the Walt Disney animated shorts in chronological order and had the opportunity to watch these classics.  Now as an adult with children, a lot of the animation from Walt Disney that my child sees is the latest in CG animation.

But I wanted him to sit and watch these animated shorts with me and sure enough, he enjoyed them.  These animated shorts, the majority of them are simple and have no dialogue.  Just music and sound effects (there were a few especially all from vol. 6 that have dialogue) but nevertheless, are simple and easy to understand.

For fans of classic Walt Disney animation and you pretty much have moved on away from your VHS copies, the ""Walt Disney Animation Collection"" is a great collection of your classic Disney animated shorts on DVD.

Many people who have purchased the ""Walt Disney Treasures"" DVD box sets from 2001, ""Walt Disney's Timeless Tales"" from 2005 or the ""Walt Disney's It's a Small World of Fun!"" DVD release from 2007 probably may not need any of these shorts as quite a number of them have appeared on DVD already.

But a few of the short films that are featured on the six volumes of ""Walt Disney Animation Collection"" have not been released on DVD until now.

Overall, It all comes down to your preference to the classic animated shorts from long ago and whether or not you owned previous releases.  For those who haven't owned the previous Disney DVD shorts or box sets, now is a good time to start because a lot of the past releases have been discontinued.

Otherwise, if you are a person who already owns the previous DVD releases that contain these shorts, unfortunately, these animated shorts offer nothing new and are not digitally remastered.  There may be a few titles on these DVD's that have not been released before on prior Walt Disney DVD's but it all comes down to your preference and if these episodes are worth having on DVD.

But if you are a parent or grandparent who wants to show your children or grandchildren the Walt Disney animation that you grew up with or a person who has never seen these shorts and have been curious about them, then definitely give ""Walt Disney Animation Collection"" a chance.",1242086400,40,6238,4.664226898444648

It had a volume 7, but it was vaulted due to the 2013 DVD/Blu-ray release of Mickey's Christmas Carol, albeit Faux-Widescreen. Like I keep saying with the classic Disneytoon shorts DVDs that are vaulted, just be thankful for what you still have. In this volume, the Reluctant Dragon contains its own ending card, as it never did in volume 4 of It's A Small World of Fun, ending abruptly. Also in here are restored prints of 3 other beloved classics, 2 of which are from corrected prints of the Rarities Treasures tin, and 1 being the uncut version of Johnny Appleseed, from Melody Time (Disney's 10th animated feature). For reasons unknown, Disney used unrestored prints of nearly all the shorts in the Rarities Treasures tin, but they did send replacement discs, for those who complained about such lackluster treatment from a high-class collection meant for collectors.

3779672,5,B001RTKKNA,"If the name Walt Disney doesn't mean anything to you re: children's movies & ""Classics"", then you won't like this DVD. The truth of the matter is that Walt Disney had MANY short, entertaing & fun movies that often had a hidden moral in them (friendship, compassion, understanding, different opinions,etc). This DVD has the terrific ""Reluctant Dragon"" as well as Ferdinand the Bull"", Johnny Appleseed"", & ""Goliath"" (the VERY tiny elephant)! All of which can show values that are as pertinent today as they were when these ""shorts"" were made. My only regret was that the original VHS had ""Morris, the Midget Moose"" on it & that was ommitted on this DVD.Maybe they felt that Goliath made the point re: size but I still wish Morris had been included as well. I HIGHLY recommend this DVD to all parents who have children (from 2 years up)! They will enjoy the short movies &, without knowing it, may just pick up on the ""moral"" that is being portrayed.",1345334400,5,947,4.676646706586826
3779673,4,B001RTKKNA,"This disc contains four ancient Disney short films. I'm not sure I'd ever seen two of them before, and quite sure I haven't seen any of them for a very, very long time.

The Reluctant Dragon is a story about a dragon that hates fighting. He's warned that a knight with a reputation for being a fearless dragon killer is on his way. He'd rather recite poetry and have a picnic with his little friend, a boy who loves to read about knights and dragons. But it turns out the knight also writes poetry (both of them very, very bad poets), so they negotiate a deal to pretend to fight to impress the villagers.

Ferdinand the Bull likes to sit under the cork tree (it has bottle corks hanging from it like fruit) and smell the flowers. But of course the bull fight promoters want him to fight. He's big and strong, and when he accidentally sits on a bumble bee, gets quite fierce. So he's chosen for the bull ring, with disastrous results.

Goliath II is a tiny, very tiny elephant. Goliath I is huge and very proud, and is terribly ashamed of his son, not much bigger than a mouse. Actually, his size is not quite consistent throughout the film. Little Goliath looks remarkably like Dumbo, except for his ears, and his mother and the other female elephants were pretty clearly drawn by the same artist who did Dumbo. How does he gain his father's respect? By fighting and defeating the only thing the adult elephants are afraid of: a mouse. Why they are afraid of a mouse is never explained.

The Legend of Johnny Appleseed is a very familiar story narrated by Dennis Day. It's quite religious: Johnny goes off with a bag of apple seeds, a cook pot for a hat, and a large Bible. He sings ""The Lord is Good to Me,"" and is inspired to head west on his apple seeding mission by his guardian angel.

This is a fascinating look into some of the Disney cartoons from the 1940s, when the studio experimented with very different styles and stories. Enjoy.",1336608000,,1943,4.431372549019608

Big disappointment.  The quality of the movie is so poor that I didn't finish watching it.  Didn't show it to the Grandkids.  It was just too grainy and hard to look at.  What are they thinking?  Disney did a wonderful job creating the film.  Why make such a poor DVD of it?  I don't understand it.  So, there it sits, unwatched.  Very sad.  I rated this 2 stars because I loved the movie.

This is the type of story/movie that doesn't lose anything through time -- this is now three generations of my family that have held this tale in such high regard.  There are other short movies included on this collection, of course, and they are also wonderful classics.  This is coming from one of ""those moms"" who is very strict about what her son watches -- I don't let him watch very much cartoon-violence yet, which puts most of the classic cartoons off-limits (to give you an idea, he doesn't watch anything above the ""G"" level, and even some of those are off-limits).

I identify with it and hope I can be as strong in my convictions as he/she/it is in theirs.  ""There's nothing to fight about!""  Funny because I just lifted the chords to the song ""From A Distance"".  The lyrics to the third verse are:  ""From a distance you look like my friend even though we are at war. From a distance I just cannot comprehend what all this fighting is for. From a distance there is harmony and it echoes through the land. It's the hope of hopes it's the love of loves it's the heart of every man.""  Homosexuals are no more important than heterosexuals, but different talents, strengths, depths, pros and cons exist for every individual, and I feel it's important not to exclude people of the GLBTA (Gay/Lesbian/Bisexual/Transgender Aggie) community.  I believe that I, as well as my GLBTA peers, have something to offer the world just as vital as heterosexuals.  We are often ""different"".  Sure.  But I know we're all knowing by this time that different is not only ""ok"", but it's really the whole point.  I believe we're here to learn to love that which is different from ourselves.  I wanna' be reciting a poem where someone may expect a fight.  A song when one may expect yelling.  A picnic and a warm welcome to even strangers.  :)  I might admit I'm dreaming but....it's not really that far off.
