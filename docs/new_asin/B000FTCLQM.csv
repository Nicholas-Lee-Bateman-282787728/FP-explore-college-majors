2584701,5,B000FTCLQM,This movie was very good and as always Jimmy Stewart is very good in anything he did,1267660800,,84,4.0
2584702,4,B000FTCLQM,"There are some pretty absurd statements in some of the reviews below, from people on both the left and the right ends of the political spectrum.  Listen, this film was produced with the full cooperation and participation of the FBI, so of course it's going to be unabashed propaganda for the bureau.  But so what? The FBI Story was produced 50 years ago in a very different world.  What's the point of being angry about it now? It's still entertaining to watch.  Stewart is always an engaging actor, and Vera Miles is very good as his long-suffering wife.  It goes on a little too long, otherwise I'd give it 5 stars.

One thing nobody has mentioned is how good this DVD looks.  I love the old Technicolor movies from the 50's, and this one looks great.  The scenes in the South American jungle, wherever they were actually shot, are a riot of color, and the whole film is a treat for the eyes.",1257638400,3,894,4.441717791411043
2584703,5,B000FTCLQM,"Jimmy Stewart explains to a ""fly on the wall"" and superbly dramatizes the glory days of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  He tells the intriguing tales of how the FBI was able to crack some of the most mysterious, diabolically clever, grisliest crimes it ever sought to crack and how it infiltrated some of the most heineous underground organizations ever launched in our country.  The frames of the reels are filled with not one story, but several different cases and stories, and these are woven into the fabric of his pressure-cooker personal and family life.  It is very entertaining and thought-provoking to the viewer, especially when keeping in mind the later opinions generated by J. Edgar Hoover and his stange ways. A very good movie.  Watch Jimmy as he comes face to face with the living personas depicted on wanted posters.",1229212800,,839,4.929078014184397

2584705,5,B000FTCLQM,I have been looking for the FBI story for a long time and have until now been unable to find it. Amazon had it so I ordered it from them. I receive it within 2 weeks and being on the other side of the world was something I thought was great. It is I believe one of James Stewart's best movies and I have already watched it twice. Thank you.,1222646400,,340,3.8714285714285714
2584706,5,B000FTCLQM,"""The FBI Story"" is hands down the funniest straight-laced drama ever made, and one of the greatest '50s pro-government propoganda tools to boot. Made by a scared Hollywood, the film is a white wash of the FBI and J. Edgar Hoover's history. Case in point: Hoover is shown from behind as a strikingly tall invidual with broad shoulders. In fact, he was not. The FBI is shown as a great supporter of Civil Rights and fighting the KKK. In fact, they did every thing in their power to destory MLK Jr. and anyone who dared take on the white power establishment. Let's not get into wire-tapping, secret files and blackmail schemes. People die of gunshots and slump down dead; no blood, no pain, just all quick and fun. It's all so phony, it's a laugh riot. Take the death of a major character within Stewart's family -- it's false, and must have come from the pen of someone who's never even met a man who has lost a child. A few folks here call it ""true American history"" and decry ""liberal modernism."" How sad that they lie to themselves. Do they also think blacks voluntarily came over to America to happily work our fields? Or that four girls blew themsleves up in a church in Alabama? I can't imagine a minority who lived during the '50s or before can look at this and call it true. Certainly, the FBI and America as a whole has done great things that are immeasurable, but let's not kid ourselves -- we've done plenty wrong. And we need to admit it, not just pretend it didn't happen. As history, ""The FBI Story"" certainly gets a 0. As what it was intended (propoganda to get boys to die for Uncle Sam) and what is (disturbingly funny), it's brilliant. Sadly brilliant.",1221523200,2,1668,4.472131147540984
2584707,5,B000FTCLQM,"Great Jimmy Stewart movie.  A very conservative take on the FBI, but for all you liberals out there, just remember it's a MOVIE.",1217635200,2,128,4.565217391304348
2584708,5,B000FTCLQM,For a look at what the FBI was at the beginning and how it has developed in one of the best crime fighting organizatios there is...you must watch this film!!!,1212624000,,158,4.3
2584709,5,B000FTCLQM,"James Stewart stars and narrates as Federal agent John Michael ""Chip"" Hardesty. I love Stewart's narration, especially his trademark wry humor, like ""This isn't very romantic kissing in the murder section"". Follow him as he apprehends the gangsters of the 20's and 30's, such as Alvin Karpis, Ma Barker, and Machine Gun Kelly all the way up until the Communists of the 50's. Some see this film as purely propoganda, and others as too much about Hardesty's private life. Personally, I see it as the birth of the bureau, with Stewart in the pivotal role, and his personal life as a subplot which helps him escape from the confines of the agency itself. I will admit that the subplot of his personal life is somewhat tedious - his son is killed at Iwo Jima, his daughter forgets her speech at a school event, etc. But who cares? The movie is more about the birth of the agency. However, the movie does have somewhat of a throwback to the gangster films of the 30's and 40's in its art direction, production design, costumes, hair styles, and especially the gunfights. Vera Miles heads up the supporting cast as Chip's wife Lucy, along with Murray Hamilton as Chip's polar opposite, and Nick Adams as the center of the very first investigation in the film - a psychotic who kills so he can collect the life insurance on what he has done. Also watch for Parley Baer as Harry Dakins, a very lazy and despicable excuse for what an agent should be. Adams delivers probably one of the best lines in the film - ""In case I get any mail, you can send it to Canyon City Prison for the next month or so. After that you can send it to hell!"" The film is directed by Mervyn LeRoy who had also directed both Hamilton and Adams alongside Andy Griffith in the hilarious military comedy ""NO TIME FOR SERGEANTS"". LeRoy's direction in this one is crisp and never pulls any punches. The movie is adapted from the best seller by Don Whitehead, and the script is crackling with tension and excitement. Stewart has one of his best roles, as do Hamilton, Adams, Miles and Baer. It is also one of LeRoy's best directing efforts.

2584710,5,B000FTCLQM,"This crisp remastered DVD version brings the FBI of the 1950s back to life. The film begins with a modern forensic investigation into a murder involving an aeroplane, and then a flashback to the beginnings of the agency. The story is told from the perspective of one agent, Chip Hardesty, from the agency's early struggles finding facilities and pitting unarmed agents against gangsters with machine guns, to World War II where it tackled enemy agents in South America, to a modern force with all the resources of technology and fire power at its disposal.  An exciting and entertaining film, even though it was made nearly half a century ago.",1192320000,,643,4.89908256880734

Essentially ""Strategic Air Command"" but with tommyguns instead of B-36's.  The troubled but eventually successful home life, the responsible husband doing his duty in an unpopular line of work as an FBI agent, etc.  In ""Strategic Air Command"" the great visuals help to carry a weak script -- in ""The F.B.I.

2584799,1,B000FTCLQM,"I go against the grain of all the praise from other reviewers.  To me, this movie is a colossal DUD.  I watched it, or stood it, as long as I could but after an hour and 45 minutes I had to give it up.  There was another 45 minutes remaining.  The big turnoff for me was the hokey story, chock full of Jimmy Stewart and Vera Miles' domestic life.  What's the enjoyment out of seeing so much bickering and quarreling?  So much of the acting seemed contrived, hokey, second rate -- even Jimmy Stewart's part.  Perhaps it was the bad writing.

It's also a celebration of J. Edgar Hoover's national law enforcers as well as a heartstring-pulling ""date"" movie for marrieds. Jimmy Stewart's central character tries, not always successfully, to balance a career as a dedicated G-Man with a wife and family. Unfortunately, the many domestic sequences slow the story down and give this picture a bloated 2 hour running time.

Best here are the portions that deal with Midwest crime figures like John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson and Ma Barker. Too bad they're sketchy, brief and few.

Also with Vera Miles, Murray Hamilton, Nick Adams (as an airline bomber), plus cameos from Luana Anders, Ann Doran, Stacy Keach Sr., Roy Thinnes,  Chief Yowlachie, the voice of Adam West, and the Hoove himself!

2584941,5,B000FTCLQM,The movie covers a period in the history of the FBI as experienced through the life of agent Chip Hardesty.

Don't get sidetracked by political correctness and revelations about Hoover. This was the original film adaptation by veteran Hollywood director Mervyn LeRoy from Putlitzer Prize winner Don Whitehead's bestseller. Offsetting the detective work and bloodless shootouts is the romance and family life of Hardesty with Vera Miles. Music is scored by Max Steiner and heightens drama. Another one suitable for entire family.",1390953600,,732,5.264957264957265
2584943,4,B000FTCLQM,"All fans of 1930s Warner gangster pictures should see director Mervyn LeRoy's (and Warner's) widescreen Technicolor, 149 minute production of THE FBI STORY (1959). Because much of the story takes place in the 1920s and '30s, we see the familiar old cars, clothing styles and weaponry used in those exciting motion pictures.

James Stewart and Vera Miles star. Murray Hamilton is Jimmy's first FBI partner. They see all the major crime events of that 20 year span and are in on the capture or killing of such outlaws as John Dillinger, Pretty Boy Floyd and Baby Face Nelson. These sequences are right out of WB's best gangster films.

Also with Nick Adams, as a man who sends his mom aboard an airliner with a timebomb, so that when she and 48 others perish, he can collect on a flight insurance policy.

Uncrediteds include J. Edgar Hoover, Chief Yowlachie, Luana Anders, Ann Doran, Stacy Keach Sr. (as Machine Gun Kelly), Roy Thinnes  and the voice of Adam West.

This one in look and feel has Warner's written all over it and I think it's a classic!

2584951,3,B000FTCLQM,"This is certainly not like the movie the ""Untouchables,"" for sure, but it is enjoyable.  It gives a bit of the history about the establishment of the FBI, as well as a few of its cases.  I do enjoy Jimmy Stewart.",1368576000,,212,4.146341463414634
2584952,5,B000FTCLQM,"I am former law enforcement and remember seeing this as a kid and it had a BIG influence on me since I already wanted to go into law enforcement.
James Stewart was great and so was Vera Miles and all the other actors, including a cameo by J. Edgar Hoover. Look for it, I still can remember seeing him, but hear his voice in the beginning.
This was when being a ""Fed"" really seemed to be something special and having that Gold Badge carried a lot of weight.
Nowadays since DHS took over, things aren't the same. Even the U.S. Secret Service took a ""hit"" with the DHS changes.
Anyway, see the real FBI as it was in the beginning and how most of it still remains the same in it's best traditions as the leading federal law enforcement agency of the United States.
Plenty of excitement and a real thriller.
Don't waste another minute, and buy or rent this movie now. You'll want if in your private collection like I did. There are plenty of ""good"" agents and most do not get the real ""Credit"", but plenty of job satisfaction and a job well done which protected the U.S. and it's citizens since before the second World War and the ""Cold War"" of the 50's.",1367452800,3,1149,4.324074074074074
2584953,5,B000FTCLQM,"This is the movie that I will stop and watch no matter whatever I should be doing instead. Jimmy Stewart is an acting icon. Part propaganda film, part history of the F.B.I (cleansed of any unseemly facts or dissenting opinions) The FBI Story will allow the viewer to take the journey through the inception of J. Edgar Hoovers FBI to the late 1950's. The wholesome years. It also will give insight into why the FBI was created and its changing purpose during those decades through the eyes of an active special agent, Jimmy Stewart.
Along with Strategic Air Command and It's a Wonderful Life,The FBI story are my favorite Jimmy Stewart films. True Americana.",1365897600,3,657,4.771929824561403

He relates his experiences with the FBI, from the time it started with J. Edgar Hoover as the head of the organization.
You see his investigative skills revealed in some of his cases via flashback.",1356825600,,305,4.648148148148148

2584960,5,B000FTCLQM,"I love classic movies and in the docudrama genera this is one of best.

This classic movie is partly filmed inside the old FBI headquarters in Washington DC.
It also has a cameo role by J. Edgar Hoover.  It's a good suspense movie that everyone will enjoy.

Having worked for the bureau, I also find looking at the interior shots, brings back fond memories.
This is a movie you can watch many times and not get tired of it.

I highly recommend the movie

2584983,4,B000FTCLQM,"A great historical snapshot of the FBI up through the Cold War. Jimmy Stewart does his best with a script that seems to be sterilized by JE Hoover to give the public an entertaining film. As such it is somewhat flat and drawn out. For those who are Stewart fans or who want to see the earlier years of the FBI, it serves its purpose.",1326067200,,333,4.138461538461539
2584984,5,B000FTCLQM,"This was a gift for my husband for Christmas.  He had casually mentioned he had never seen the entire movie so I thought I would surprise him with it.  We took an afternoon after Christmas and watched it together.  It was a great classic movie.  James Stewart as always was fantastic in his role.  Light-hearted scenes with some subtle humor mixed into this drama.  We would watch it again and again to catch those lines we may have missed the first time. If you don't have this in a classic collection, I would recommend adding it.",1325808000,6,532,4.489583333333333

Am very pro-gun and was confused with this scene, so was off-kilter for the other high and mighty POVs of the B...  All I am aware of through cinema is they screwed Joe Pistone bigtime and I will never get over the mix up with the CIA and 9/11.  BUT loved Stewart and Miles, and the jungle scenes were absolutely breathtaking and unexpected! Knowing J Edgar has such a bad rap, it was fair to at least hear his side of the story and that he made certain, what a hero!! ;}  Look forward to the Leonardo film.",1321833600,,710,4.323308270676692
2584988,5,B000FTCLQM,"I saw this film in 1959 when I was 10 years old, and was intrigued. Attention spans being what they are, the short episodes kept my interest throughout the 2  hour film. Sure it's often corny, but there was enough action to hold my interest. Also a pretty fair history lesson. Watching it again was enjoyable. Too bad this big Warner Bros epic by Mervyn LeRoy was treated so badly by critics. Audiences felt differently, including me.",1298160000,,434,4.636363636363637

8126355,4,B000FTCLQM,"If you like Jimmie Stewart, this is him at his finest. It has that late 50's feel, as you would expect. Back in the days when everything was great, for white folks. Women didn't have to work outside the home, and they did their housework in high heels and pearls.

This is a long film, as others have mentioned, and it documents several decades in FBI history. I have read that the FBI took the making of this film very seriously, screened everyone involved, and always had 2 agents present on the set.

Anyway, this is mostly patriotic FBI propaganda to some extent. A little corny, but definitely worth watching.

If you have seen ""It's a Wonderful Life"", some of the scenes with Mr Stewart will seem vaguely familiar. In that film, George Bailey almost left the Building and Loan for greener pastures. In this movie, Hardesty ponders leaving the FBI for similar reasons. They stay because of loyalty to family and love of country. The themes are very familiar.

I think Jimmie Stewart was essentially playing himself in some of his movies.

Overall, good film.

We stumbled upon it this afternoon, and I am glad.",1526083200,,1115,4.663265306122449
