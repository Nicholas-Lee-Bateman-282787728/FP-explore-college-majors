3850512,5,B00261E0D4,Good stuff. It gives you things to work. And work you must to get just a few of the skills that this monster player will share.,1309910400,,127,3.923076923076923
3850513,5,B00261E0D4,If your interested in funk drumming...this is the book/cd for you. It's fairly advanced material so would not be appropriate for a beginner.,1290556800,4,140,5.130434782608695
3850514,5,B00261E0D4,"I've been intrigued by David's style since the 70's....
Watching the master and learning from him is priceless.",1253491200,3,111,5.222222222222222
3850515,5,B00261E0D4,"I always admired DG with Tower and this video is a great one if you like to play funk on the drums. He covers the importance of ghosting the notes and using two different stick heights during your playing. Simple, yet informative. The only thing I regret is not having listened to the CD ""Code of Funk"" before watching the DVD, since DG spends a great deal of time dissecting the grooves on the tunes on this CD. It would have been more fulfilling if I had the listening knowledge of hearing the tunes before they were broken down. All in all, a good DVD from a great funk drummer. Makes you feel like you are taking a lesson from him, especially towards the end of the DVD when he is sort of instructing. Well worth it if you are into funk playing. Could help rock players as well.",1247270400,9,782,4.25503355704698
3850516,5,B00261E0D4,"I'm really glad David Garibaldi made another video. And I am glad that Hudson Music decided to make a video of his online lessons.

He is a great educator. Everything is well-explained. His concepts are amazing. His philosophy in drumming is profound. I am enjoying the DVD very much!",1244332800,3,284,4.795918367346939

8351654,5,B00261E0D4,"You should be aware that this is an accessory lesson book to accompany the original work - the Code of Funk - which is packaged with book and DVD/CDs, and also that you need a software program to handle the multi-track material, such as Garageband for the Mac or MixCraft or Acid Studio for the PC - VERY worth getting set up. I used MixCraft6 - works great - awesome way to learn to play frunk drums. It does not cost much for what you get. Fantastic when patched into and electronic drum set.",1418774400,2,494,4.26595744680851

8351656,3,B00261E0D4,"Dave's style is great and by the title I expected more information related to how he plays what he does, not a explanation of music software and making practice loops. The price was low enough, but the information was geared towards a certain level player. Taking a groove and slowing it down and explaining ""the code"" as he put it, was what I was looking for.",1398729600,,360,4.46969696969697
8351657,5,B00261E0D4,What can be said about David that hasn't been said. I'm a bass player and really enjoyed it. Video is great and I recommend it.,1393113600,2,127,4.12
8351658,5,B00261E0D4,"The first time I watched the DVD I totally didn't get it and wasn't impressed.
But then I started needed to get better at funk for playing at some jams and I came back for a second watch.
Suddenly the genius was obvious.  The whole idea of permutation and playing odd times over 4/4 immediately started working for me.  Suddenly I am playing twisted funk grooves but still keeping a pocket.
The DVD is very well done.  There are helpful transcriptions not only of some TOP songs, but for a series of permutation and 'odd-adiddles'.
Amazing how simple these insanely complicated beats truly are once you have the CODE, thanks to Dr. G.",1387152000,2,634,4.592920353982301
8351659,5,B00261E0D4,"Garibaldi is an amazing drummer with a unique approach that can help elevate any drummer's skill level and repertoire no matter what genre(s) you play. I would recommend using it along with the book ""The Code of Funk"" which comes with the play along cd. I think it is great that some of the most successful drummers have made dvd's which allows the drumming community the opportunity to learn with masters when we otherwise never would have had the chance. Really immersing yourself in a dvd like this can't help but broaden your view of things.",1374105600,3,545,4.6875
