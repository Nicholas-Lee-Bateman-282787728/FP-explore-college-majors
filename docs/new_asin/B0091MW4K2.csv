8534361,5,B0091MW4K2,"One has to be a fan of Sir Georg to enjoy this DVD.  I am, so I did.  There is not much new information on the great
conductor, but I enjoyed Lady Solti's comments as well as some of his former players and friends.  The obvious
enthusiasm and PASSION Solti had for music is the first thing I notice about, not only interviews, but in the actual playing of the various orchestras....especially the CSO.  I have just about ALL of the recordings and now the DVDs
about Solti.  This one is a prize possession.",1359504000,10,505,4.329787234042553
