3963683,5,B002P7UCJ0,"It's an odd thing to laugh so much that you actually have short-term side effects.  It's happened to me in several movie theaters, including when I watched Dumb and Dumber, both Jackass flicks, and of course the now-legendary Borat.  But now I have one more movie to add to that list:  Sacha Baron Cohen's most over-the-top comedy yet, Bruno.  Most moviegoers will ask how Bruno compares to Borat.  Is it better?  Is it funnier?  Will I feel like vomiting and laughing at the same time, as during at least one part in particular in Borat?  While the first two questions are difficult to answer, to the third I can only say:  a resounding ""yes.""
 Comparing Bruno to Borat is like the over-cliched comparison of apples to oranges; they are similar films only in that both Cohen plays the title role and goes out of his way to make audiences laugh so hard that it actually hurts.  He perfects this art in Bruno, a movie that has so many shock moments, instances of sexual depravity and nudity, and homosexual sequences that its R rating can easily be called into question.  However, Cohen makes these situations so hilariously overdone that even those adverse to watching movies like this can't help but at least chuckle at how much the envelope is pushed in the film's short 83 minutes.  Bruno contains all the snippets that made Borat an instant classic, with one exception:  an emotive and empathetic storyline.  Whereas with Borat I at times could almost feel sorry for the struggling Kazakh reporter, in Bruno I found myself wanting the Austrian fashionista to get into situations that no other characters would dare tread.
 Bruno's plot, in short, portrays titular character Bruno (possibly the most flamboyantly homosexual character ever created), who early on in the movie is fired from his fashion reporting job.  The entire focus of the movie from that point on is following Bruno's attempted ascendance to celebrity status.  He creates a TV pilot containing more visual references to male nudity than most pornographic films.  He adopts an African baby.  He joins the military.  He's taught how to disarm someone who chooses to fight with a sex toy instead of more contemporary weapons.  He joins a swingers' group.  He creates situations of total embarassment, carelessly launches himself into them, and comes out the shining star in absolutely all of them.  The most rewarding part of the movie is when his ultimate plan to become famous, by converting to heterosexuality, comes into play.  And if you thought the finale to Borat was hilarious, just you wait.
 I can't stress enough how many boundaries this breaks in the shock-comedy category.  All the hype surrounding the movie is completely warranted, and there's no telling where Cohen's craft can possibly go from here.  Bruno may not be as timeless as Borat, but is a classic in its own right, a film that will gross out even the most stalwart of viewers, but reward them with more laughs than should be allowable by the human body.",1247443200,,2999,4.850393700787402
3963684,4,B002P7UCJ0,"Bruno is the latest movie starring Sasha Baron Cohen; and I must agree with people who write that this movie is *not* for those of us who are easily offended. Some of the humor is crude although there are some pretty good sight gags and funny situations scattered all throughout the film. The jokes and gags aren't quite as good as they were in ""Borat;"" but the plot moves along at a very good pace--you won't be bored! The cinematography is excellent and I can tell they put a good deal of effort even into the choreography.

When the action starts, we quickly meet Bruno, a nineteen-year-old gay man who hosts his own fashion television show called Zeitgeist in Austria. Bruno talks with guests on his show and he even sets fashion trends! He has two assistants as well who certainly don't have any qualms about having relations with Bruno when Bruno is ""in the mood""--and that's always what Bruno is up for! However, a disaster suddenly disrupts Bruno's life--he shows up at a chic fashion show wearing a suit made entirely out of Velcro; and when it sticks to everything in sight he's kicked out of the show--and out of the fashion world altogether!

After losing his television show and his place in the spotlight, Bruno is lost. He desperately wants to be world famous regardless of what that may take! This is also the movie's perfect opportunity to poke fun at celebrity interviews, trends of the day and so much more.

Suffice it to say that Bruno goes on a myriad of adventures to be ""the greatest Austrian superstar since Hit***;"" and one of his two assistants, Lutz, does join him for most of these journeys. Bruno tries practically anything and everything in his best yet incredibly inane attempts to become world famous--he tries to get into acting but has considerable difficulty cutting it even as a lowly extra; he decides to try making his own television show interviewing celebrities including an interview with Paula Abdul; he tries to make a XXX rated video--with the help of Ron Paul, 2008 presidential candidate (who actually does perform a cameo in this film along with Paula Abdul); and Bruno does so much more in his frantic quest to become world famous. Look for the segment that makes fun of the extremes parents will go to in order to get their kids into the spotlight--Sacha Baron Cohen and the other makers of this movie do an excellent job with this!

Of course, the plot can still go anywhere from here. Will Bruno ever achieve world fame--and, if he does, how? What could the price of fame be? Will Lutz stay with Bruno or will they fight and go their own ways? What could happen if Bruno ever tried to become a straight man? The answers may surprise you. However, no plot spoilers here, folks--watch and find out! The finale is quite good.

Overall, Bruno is one of the better comedies I've seen lately although the gags were not quite as good as the ones in ""Borat."" Sasha Baron Cohen does a terrific job of acting and so do the others. I recommend this film especially for people who want a light comedy that won't make them think too much after a hard day's work. Thank you, Sasha Baron Cohen!",1247356800,,3131,4.603942652329749
3963685,5,B002P7UCJ0,"Yes, the movie has a lot of crude humor for people who are not very open-minded or they are used to socializing with people who are not very open-minded. For what feels like only an hour of hilarity, I was just amazed at what I was seeing. Yes, Ali G/Bruno/Borat is a social critic on America, and goes on a show for about two hours. The movie makes you laugh as if you are replaying what happened at the MTV award with Eminem for two hours. Eminem himself says he was laughing too, although probably not with Bruno but at Bruno. Yes, I am okay with other people's problems, yet it makes me think if I am very open-minded. Snoop Dogg raps at the end of the movie, which is a bonus.",1247356800,3,681,4.166666666666667
3963686,4,B002P7UCJ0,"i like funny movies, even edgy movies, but wow...Bruno really made the R rating look like a joke.

Bruno is a solid movie, and there are some really funny parts, but there are also some parts that honestly leave you asking, ""how in the heck did this movie get an R-rating?""

""how with all the stuff they throw in, did the movie make it to American theaters?""

""how can the movie show so much nudity and sex scenes to even be in an American theater?""

think about it...just about any nudity and the film gets an R rating, yet here, you get....FULL FRONTAL (aroused, turning, flapping and everything) and you get a full uncut swinger sex party scene that is pretty shocking to see in a theater rather than some late night tv program.

overall, Bruno was funny, but those parts are bad. i'm not conservative or liberal or anything, but those parts don't fit an R rating.

for those of you thinking of taking your younger than 18 year old kids, be warned.

you can forget the birds and bees speech because here, they'll learn about the different set ups.",1247356800,3,1050,4.465968586387435
3963687,4,B002P7UCJ0,"Ultimate reality situation comic/performance artist Sacha Baron Cohen goes ""gay"" for laughs. Cambridge graduate Sacha Baron Cohen likes to play characters that are not particularly bright. As these characters Baron Cohen does and says outlandish things in order to get a reaction from those he interviews. What separates Ali G from Borat and Borat from Bruno is not their reasoning skills but each characters intention. Ali G was a kind of Zelig seeking cultural acceptance, Borat was a cultural alien seeking cultural knowledge, and Bruno is a poseur who thinks he can become a star just by wearing terrific outfits and acting as if he is already famous. Ali G was a deconstruction of hip; Borat was a deconstruction of ethnicity and race and gender (and other forms of cultural belonging); and now Bruno is a deconstruction of fame. Bruno wants fame so badly that he'll go to any lengths or depths to get it. At first he tries to make it on his talent but since that doesn't work he decides the second best way to fame is through controversy; Bruno does find he has a talent for that.

While Bruno the film might not be as logically constructed as Borat the film, and while it may be true that Sacha Baron Cohen has to outdo himself with each new character in order to induce maximum shock value, it is also true that no one else making films today is as keen a cultural critic.

Howard Stern is called a shock jock, and much reality tv is predicated on shock value, but Sacha Baron Cohen's brand of entertainment does not just pander to the audience's appetite for scandal and sensationalism and the ridiculous as does Stern's, rather he works like an embedded cultural anthropologist and he effectively directs our gaze upon ourselves and our social belief systems and practices. Stern is always pushing beyond the bordelands of what our culture considers good taste and getting in trouble for it. I suppose you could argue that Stern is the prototype for Sacha Baron Cohen's comedy, but I think Baron Cohen pushes beyond those borderlands of good taste more purposefully than has Stern or other reality provocateurs.

I think what really singles Sacha Baron Cohen out from the reality entertainment crowd is his ability to critique culture from so many angles and perspectives. Stern is always Stern and we are used to his sensibility and because we know what to expect it ceases to shock but Baron Cohen with his multi-character approach continues to be provocative and to challenge us on many cultural fronts.

And its an exhilerating assault!",1247270400,3,2550,4.815068493150685
3963688,5,B002P7UCJ0,"This movie is *clearly* for those not easily offended.  It is shocking and hysterical, but I don't think I could allow my parents to go see it.

Sasha Baron Cohen's latest creation, Bruno, makes his way to America to become uber-famous any way he can.  And he goes through lots of different attempts on his way.  Acting, interviewing celebrities, guesting on talk shows, becoming straight, he tries many methods, each with it's painfully funny result.  You'll love the Paula Abdul interview, particularly.

The interactions with people are wonderful, and you will be appalled at what some parents will do to get their children into show business.  Just stunning.

There are a lot of shocking/uncomfortable funny moments (be prepared for gratuitous male nudity), and I am no sure how they will hold up for repeated viewings, but in a crowded theater, it was a scream.  The ending is worth the buildup, and stick around for the closing song.

I laughed so hard that my face was hurting, and my wife was crying from laughing so hard.  It takes a while to recover, but soooooo worth it!

NOT for the kids.",1247184000,70,1101,4.767195767195767
3963689,5,B002P7UCJ0,"Sacha Baron Cohen is more of a daredevil than Evel Kenivel and Phillip Petite combined. He may not have jumped across a line of buses with a motorcycle or walked on a tightrope across the World Trade Center, but he has willingly subjected himself to dangerous people in equally dangerous situations in order to make mockumentaries. He incurs the wrath of those in positions of power. He's willing to make everyone hate him just for the sake of getting us to laugh. In ""Borat,"" while in disguise as the title character, he sang a fake Kazakhstani national anthem to the tune of our national anthem at a rodeo full of uber-conservative Virginians. He spewed sexist banter to a group of feminists and anti-Semitic banter to his camcorder while staying at a bed and breakfast owned by a Jewish couple. This man knows no fear.

He proves that once again with ""Brno,"" a mockumentary from director Larry Charles. This movie is just plain funny. It's audacious at a level I've rarely seen, and truth be told, I wouldn't mind seeing more of that kind of filmmaking. Instead of a Kazakhstani journalist, Cohen plays a flamboyantly gay Austrian fashionista who makes it his mission to become more famous than Hitler. If that alone doesn't make you laugh, do yourself a tremendous favor and forget you've ever heard of Cohen. You must be in on the joke. That shouldn't be too hard for most audiences, I suspect. What he says and does as the title character is so over the top that it's difficult to not see it as one big joke. It seemed, however, pretty difficult for the people involved with the film, most of whom were ordinary citizens that had no idea who Cohen was or what he was doing. I initially had a hard time getting that through my head, considering how well known he is. Then again, the people he interacts with would probably not go out of their way to see a film like ""Borat.""

After success eludes him in his native Austria, the scantily-dressed Brno decides to try his luck in Los Angeles. But it immediately proves more difficult than he thought it would be, prompting him to travel from city to city with his head-over-heels assistant, Lutz (Gustaf Hammarsten). He tries acting. He tries pitching a celebrity interview program. He tries getting involved in a just cause. He tries swapping an African baby for an iPod. He even tries going into therapy to cure him of his homosexuality, because, obviously, all the cool celebrities are straight. At one point, he tries to prove he loves women by competing in an Arkansas cage fight, attended by a rowdy, beer-swilling group of homophobic rednecks with murderous glints in their eyes. Were there no cameras there, were there no film crew, I'm not convinced Cohen would be alive today.

What I love about Cohen is that he's more than a comedian. He may in fact be one of the most effective social critics who ever walked. As Borat and Brno, two manifestly ignorant characters, he exposes the real ignorance and stupidity that still plague humanity. In ""Brno,"" Cohen and Charles have a lot of fun at the expense of various anti-gay groups. Whatever your beliefs, you can't help but feel a little sorry for Jody Trautwein, a Points of Grace Ministries youth pastor who genuinely believed he was curing a gay man. I don't feel quite as sorry for the picketers of a well-known extremist organization, who had to endure the sight of Cohen and Hammarsten strapped together while wearing super erotic gear.

But there are other people Cohen targets besides homophobes. Brno pays a visit to a photography studio, where hopeful stage parents pretty up their toddlers for a photo shoot. A brief montage makes it perfectly clear that many of these people should not have had children in the first place. Later on, he travels to the Middle East and moderates a discussion between Israeli Yossi Alpher and a Palestinian man; the scene plays mostly for laughs, but even as Brno, Cohen is actually addressing a serious issue, and God help us all, he was making sense. By acting foolishly, he sheds light on just how foolish everyone else in the Middle East is behaving, especially in this terrible situation. If only they saw it the same way.

And that's what ""Brno"" is all about: Finding the humor in mindsets that are anything but humorous. So I guess it's good that Cohen is so willing to put himself on the line, because goodness knows laughter can often expose ignorance much more effectively than dramatic commentaries. Ninety years ago, we had Charlie Chaplin. Fifty years ago, we had Lucille Ball. Today, we have Sacha Baron Cohen. Yes, I truly believe he will someday be regarded as one of funniest people who ever lived. The funniest and the most insightful. The funniest, the most insightful, and the craziest. No one should be this blas about their own well being ... except when we find ourselves laughing. And boy, will you laugh during ""Brno,"" a movie that's just plain hilarious. And brilliant.",1247184000,10,4948,4.7354988399071924
3963690,5,B002P7UCJ0,"I have to see Bruno more than once, most people probably do too.  That's because Bruno is one of those rare movies where you're laughing so hard at some parts you know you're missing the next funny thing.  As gay, Austrian fashionista and celebrity-wannabe Bruno, Baron Cohen continues his jaw-droppingly crass and outrageous stealth comedy antics.  Purportedly, Baron Cohen has been beaten up while in character, so it only seems fair that he makes his audience laugh hard enough to hurt.

Of course the usual Baron Cohen caveat is in order: yes, its offensive, yes, its gross, yes, there is a LOT of nudity, mostly male.  If any of this is not your cup of tea, that's dandy, no hard feelings.  If you don't mind the occasional sight of literally bouncing balls in the name of comedy, Bruno is pure gold.

Post Borat fame has probably necessitated that more of this movie be staged, with at least some of the people (a talk show host, the driver of an oncoming car) in on the joke.  But scripted or natural- its wickedly funny.  And enough of it is genuine- including Bruno's interview/sex tape with Ron Paul, parents of would-be baby stars volunteering their 12-month-olds to play Nazis, ex-gay ministers, straight-rally wrestling audiences and general bystanders to Bruno's public antics.

Bruno balances the line between social commentary and comedy like a model on a catwalk.  As with Borat half the humor comes from people reactings (or not) to the character's outrageous behavior, and half from the eerily apt caricature Baron Cohen creates.  Fame-hound Bruno is everything narcissitic, uninformed, vain and with the all-too-common undeserved sense of entitlement that makes up the worst of American pop culture.  As with Borat, Bruno learns some life-lessons and grows as a person by the end of the movie- as Baron Cohen always seems to want to better his audience, even if he has to beat them over the head with a dildo to do it.",1247184000,69,1938,4.854103343465046

3963781,5,B002P7UCJ0,"I'm quite willing to stick my neck out and have my no-longer-recognizable head handed back to me.  The last two films that I've seen by Sacha Baron Cohen--""The Dictator"" and ""Bruno""--are both superior to the more publicized (and profitable) ""pilot"" film by a film-maker who appears to have more chutzpah (and courage) than imagination and talent.  Nevertheless, in the history of film sometimes that's enough to distinguish a filmmaker possessing genuine singularity, importance and, not least of all, the power, simply, to entertain.

Buster Keaton took on the seemingly absurdist project of writing, filming and acting in the story of his single-handed defeat of the the Union army.  Charlie Chaplin dared to make a silent film about his own battle with a dehumanizing machinery and technology by releasing a silent film--""Modern Times""--when that primitive form of cinematic narrative had been dismissed if not forgotten by the American public.

Both films were classics, perhaps the best examples of comedy in cinematic history, yet neither film could muster a chuckle from a class of 100 freshman in a month-long course on comedy in the movies.  I simply changed my strategy--and definition--pretending that laughs were as irrelevant to the art of comedy in cinema as ""getting scared"" mattered in the appreciation of the most critically acclaimed milestones in the genre of horror films.

Nevertheless, laughs do matter.  The private and silent delight that I might feel while screening Chaplin and Keaton, Laurel and Hardy  (""boring,"" ""too slow""), W. C. Fields (a ""mean old man who hates and abuses kids""), and the Marx Brothers (""why are they talking all the time? what are they saying?"") is seriously compromised by sharing the experience with a class of a hundred mute spectators who may have heard about Chaplin and now an only wonder ""what's the deal?""

With Sacha Baron Cohen I could, if I chose, gloat in my moment of revenge, screening this ephemeral/vulgar/millennial next to the silent saints of cinematic comedy.  What could be more boring, uninteresting, and unfunny than childish fart jokes delivered in a faux-Germanic gay accent?  Yet, strangely,  Cohen IS funny--but only after the viewer lightens up about ""film as art"" (even comedic ""masterpieces"") and accompanies him on his endeavor to ""make a film"" (none of Cohen's projects feels ""made"" let alone planned or written).  With the initial ""Borat"" the main focus was ""Has he really caught his subjects as candidly and off-guard as we are supposed to believe?""  But now that's only one of many considerations: besides the questions about the cooperation of Paula Abdul and Ron Paul, we're left to marvel at his character's ability to ""become"" and then to ""stay"" in the character he's developed--viz. a floridly gay Austrian former fanboy who wants to become a Hollywood star by, among other things, using his adopted African 2-year-old son (""O.J."") to attract gay celebrities.

The ""jokes"" really don't strike me as any more outrageous or plain ""gross"" than what you might see from Tosh. O (&Uuml;ber-feminist Elaine Showalter's son) or most of the other vulgar stuff shown on Comedy Central after the ""Colbert Report.""  But Bruno's extreme political incorrectness comes across with an added pop because of the conveyer's apparent cluelessness about his own offensiveness.  By contrast, John Waters could make 100 ""Pink Flamingo""'s, each more disgusting than the preceding one, and the result would only be fading ""shock value"" along with the complete removal of any capacity to entertain.

In both ""The Dictator"" and ""Bruno"" Cohen does the obvious--takes on the most taboo subjects, speaks the unspeakable--and, providing that we can overcome our feeling that we're ""supposed"" to be offended by this material, the humor is physically experienced and expressed, relentlessly (my 30 minutes of tread-milling goes by in a flash when I'm laughing throughout).  Our focus is not so much on the obscenity of the dialog and visual business (the ""cure the gay"" preacher; the meeting with sexual libertines, or ""swingers,"" who are straight; Bruno's using the arena of Wrestlemania to make love to his male partner) but on Bruno's mistaken journey toward stardom (a dream shared by many young Americans, each counseled ""just be yourself"").  By taking such advice seriously, Cohen's character demonstrates the ""redemptive quality"" latent in all humor that creates sympathy for both the bigot and the victim of prejudice.

This is not to suggest that Cohen's films rank with those of the Coen brothers.  After a single screening of the existential ""No Country for Old Men,"" I remember every scene.  After a Cohen comedy I remember hardly anything except my lunatic laughter.  It's only when I remember the provocation--something entirely alien to ""my values"" --that the moment of self-recognition occurs.

Anyone who can bridge such an enormous gap in our age of non-stop polarizing gets high marks from me.  I realize I may be the only person in the room looking like an idiot--even in the dark.  If so, more power to the stimulus of a response that, when you take the time to think about it, is more of a uniter than a divider.  St. Paul said you must be ""fools for Christ,"" another way 1. of emphasizing the ""leap of faith"" required of the believer and 2. of surrendering all pretense of pride, partiality, and partisanship.

If you're the only person in the theater left laughing, learn to like it.  If you're the only person who ""gets"" the joke, thereby appearing to condone the obscene or offensive, best not count it as a mark of your superior character and taste.  Humor is a religious experience when it levels our pretensions and differences, bringing us together as a human community--even when, like Pee Wee Herman once did, we find ourselves looking foolish and alone.",1415577600,,5843,5.111461619348055

It may be one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. The idea of drawing out unsuspecting people to expose their barely-hidden racism and ignorance was brilliant, and Cohen executed it flawlessly. The other scenes, like the nude fight, were also hilarious. So I approached Bruno with similar expectations. I should have expected to be disappointed, as Borat's brilliance couldn't be repeated. A few of the sex scenes with Bruno and his boyfriend at the beginning were absurd enough to be amusing, but the movie went downhill from there. Cohen was clearly trying to get a rise out of homophobes, and didn't succeed. The Westboro Baptist Church encounter was pointless - people frequently act flamboyantly in front of the WBC; they are used to it and aren't going to react. The sequence with the ""pray the gay away"" counselor wasn't interesting either - again, the pastor was clearly so repressed that he was incapable of responding to Cohen's insulting questions and propositioning. The Straight Dave sequence was distracting in that I couldn't help wondering how Cohen got everyone to attend - you'd have to pay people to show up at a show by someone they never heard of. I also suspect that everyone was instructed to start yelling at the end when Cohen was making out with his assistant.

Then, at the very end of the film, Cohen lost his nerve. I would have really enjoyed seeing him embarrass real celebrities, but of course Cohen knows who his friends are, and isn't going to alienate anyone important - only unsuspecting rubes.

By now, Cohen is so well-known that he can't get away with this anymore, thus, in his newest film ""The Dictator,"" he plays a conventionally-scripted character. I wouldn't expect much from that either - just more Hitler references and humiliation.",1402790400,,1924,5.263843648208469

3963811,3,B002P7UCJ0,"""Bruno"" is ""Borat""'s younger cinema sibling - wisecracking, though not wise; a look-at-me risk-taker without a plan. In ""Bruno,"" Sasha Baron Cohen gives us Borat's brilliant expose of anti-Semitism in an almost homophobic wrapper. Bruno is a not very bright Austrian fashion designer who is fired from his TV job and comes to America to become famous. The film has a loose narrative about Bruno's search for fame, peppered with stunts (some real, some staged) showing Bruno getting into embarrassing situations. He ends up in a hotel bed, shackled to another man, both wearing bondage gear, and needing hotel management to help find the key to be set free. He annoys a group of swingers by talking to them while they have sex. He shows a disgusted focus group a supposed pilot for a TV series, which includes film of himself dancing in butt-baring pants and gyrating his bare genitalia. Unlike Borat, whose stunts showed off the anti-Semitism and/or prudishness of various American groups, Bruno is so over the top in its depiction of wild ""homosexual"" antics that it disgusts the viewer about gays themselves rather than about homophobic reactions.

And reactions the film does get. An audience in Arkansas is treated to a cage match that turns into an erotic grope-a-thon between two men. Audience members gasp in horror, then throw beers and chairs at the men. Bruno, wearing a very gay version of orthodox Jewish clothing, is chased down the streets of an Israeli town  by enraged onlookers. He is kicked out of a meeting with a member of the Palestinian Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade. Bruno tries to sneak, in the middle of the night, into the tents of a bunch of Alabama hunters, who predictably react with distaste. All of this makes for fascinating viewing, but does it say anything? Bruno mostly irritates because he insists on pushing his extreme actions in of the face of those around him -- most of whom need to be pushed very hard to react. If he's trying to show that the world is a homophobic place, he ends up showing that most people will tolerate about anything as long as it is not shoved down their throats.

I have to give SBC points for his daring. Going onto a talk show with an African American audience, toting a black baby named OJ (traded in Africa for an iPhone) took guts. Talking to terrorists was ballsy. Enduring potential violence in the South took courage, as  did engaging a pair of Christian gay conversion therapists. But much of the movie was funny in the way that poking a sleeping lion until it roars is funny. It says more about the man with the stick than about the lion.

In the end, Bruno is more spectacle than examination. Unfortunately, it may have cemented a hyper-sexualized caricature of gays more firmly into the minds of many.",1376265600,,2772,4.742738589211618

There was some male nudity which I think accounts for most of the 1 stars, but even the nudity scene was funny because it was what they made TV executives sit through. I think it shows the redneck homophobes of the world as being really over the top with their phobia, especially the hotel room guy who looks like he witnessed a murder. Even the cage crowd instead of walking out as most anti-gay people would do they stand around to watch and curse at them.

3963837,5,B002P7UCJ0,"Obviously, I loved this film. Although the reasons themselves may be less obvious. In some ways, I feel that Cohen is the kind of comedian who allows us to look at ourselves and our deepest insecurities with a critical eye. This, clearly, is not something most Americans want to do. What is it that frightens Americans so much about an openly gay male being himself? Clearly, as the movie demonstrates, it goes beyond a fear of gayness. It is probably a basic fear of sexuality itself. And this is probably largely due to a fundamental ignorance about sex itself. As you watch this film, it's like the before and after picture but with the person looking worse than they did before. Abstinence education really has done a number on the U.S.'s most volatile and culturally precarious subject.
The thing that truly baffles is how violent American men's reaction is to even finding out that someone they are talking to is gay. That is how crazy the homophobia has gotten. I found this film disturbing not because of the behavior of Cohen but because of the violent and, at times even sadistically hateful behavior of the people he attempted to befriend (I know he tried to hit on them - it really isn't that big of a deal - women deal with it all the time. Sometimes, some men don't even ASK beforehand. By comparison, Cohen's advances were just silly and awkward.)
One who is comfortable with who they are has no need to torture or kill those who are different. I wish that Cohen would keep making films like this. American needs to have it's hateful prejudices and insecurities laid bare for all the world to see. How else is anything ever going to change? Clearly, no one in this country is brave enough, morally mature enough (or man enough?) to step up and try. Here's to Cohen. Thanks, mate.",1343865600,3,1794,4.609375

The reviewers at Amazon.com will not let me talk about the actual content of this film. So I can't mention the swinging male body part, sex toys, the erotic stationary bike, and so on.

I also have Borat. I was not as repulsed by Borat.

Geez, my hands are tied here. I don't know what to say. I watched Bruno and all the extra features. I laughed out loud through much of the film. I also wanted to sanitize my brain and soul after the film. I'm not used to this sort of graphic sexual humor, but all the same Bruno was quite humorous at times.

I guess I put Bruno on the same level as Borat, but Borat seemed to be more believable. Bruno seemed more a work of fiction. In both films it is hard to tell what might be acting and what might be real. This is the real appeal and perverse charm of the film, watching dumbfounded or repulsed people.

Sasha Cohen is uniquely funny and I love how he seems to be able to remain in character. How is he not laughing out loud himself or how is not running for the door. I'd be afraid somebody might just knock the living heck out of me if I was doing what the Bruno character did.

And finally, Amazon probably should just pull this film or disable the comments section if we can't comment on the actual content of the Cohen films. How can I talk about fuzzy puppies and kittens when I just watched a very adult film. This movie is not for children. Maybe there should be some sort of adult filter that keeps kids from reading about movies like this. And I am really NOT HAPPY with this crappy review of mine. Go ahead, reject it.

As a character, I find Bruno more approachable than Cohen's previous backwards-era, obnoxious immigrant that took the world by storm three years ago.  That said, this is certainly a film that constantly treads on the carefully drawn borders of tolerance that our culture permits to comedy and, indeed, entertainment itself.

However, there is an incessant insistence throughout the film that, regardless of what Cohen comes up with, this kind of comedy will never achieve the revolutionary, groundbreaking status that it's predecessor was associated with; the film both benefits and suffers from such.

If you trudged through the worst moments of Borat, then you're in for a near-identical ride this time around.

3963855,4,B002P7UCJ0,"Bruno gets more mixed reviews than just about any other movie I've seen, and for different reasons. One reason being that most people who loved Borat feel the need to compare Bruno, a movie with a completely different character and pacing, to that movie seemingly because they're both by Sacha Baron Cohen. This was never supposed to be another Borat, but simply another movie with one of Cohen's characters. Other people say that the 'message' isn't as smart as the previous film's either, and here's where I start to think everyone's just silly and more hell-bent on 'getting' a movie instead of having fun watching it. The last group of people seem to just be those who didn't know what they were getting into when they saw Bruno. I saw Bruno during its first week in theaters...and there were all of 5 other people in there with me. Many who went to the midnight screenings (the earliest you could possibly see the movie, and therefore you must've known the material!) walked out, disgusted by what they say: A NAKED MAN! Myself, I had a blast watching the movie, and laughed out loud more than I did in any other movie that year. Bruno definitely isn't for everyone, and I personally don't feel that it goes too far, but it really depends on what you get offended by. For a quick test, watch a few episodes of Wonder Showzen. If you can handle that, you can definitely handle Bruno.

Bruno is an Austrian fashion icon, and host of his own show. Things turn sour for him quickly over the course of a few days when his velcro suit doesn't do as well as he hoped, he loses his show, and his pygmy boyfriend leaves him. So Bruno decides to head for America, where he plans on starting his own interview show with celebrities, shooting back into the spotlight and becoming a star once again. Of course, that doesn't happen. Many of the city people he encounters don't appreciate his sense of fashion, and want nothing to do with Bruno. Even going so far as to be straight (just like John Travolta and Tom Cruise, Bruno notes), Bruno wants his show to work, and will do whatever it takes to be famous once more.

The majority of the movie is, like Borat, interviews and segments of Bruno traveling from place to place. But it's all about the reactions that everyday people and the celebrities he interviews have. When Bruno kisses another man in a mixed martial arts ring, the crowd goes absolutely ballistic (though they would've had no problem seeing two guys in boxer briefs have a hugging contest), parents he interviews to get their kids in an ad agree to anything no matter how ridiculous the requests are, a bunch of swingers don't quite get Bruno until it's too late, and more. It's hard to talk about any of these without ruining the jokes, but all 6 of us in that theater were cracking up at every bit. A notorious scene involves Bruno's test screening for his show to some regular people in an NBC conference room. A few walk out when Bruno starts dancing suggestively, and when the camera zooms in on a man's...unit...swinging around in circles for a few seconds, only to have it point directly at the camera and yell 'BRUNO!' with the tip, you'd think that it had made personal jabs at each and every person in that room. I suppose if there IS a message here, it's to show how uncomfortable a lot of people still are with those who aren't straight, but you have to admit that Cohen's really pushing it, going pretty far to get that message out there. It's still funny, but the difference between this and Borat is that where Borat came off to most as just someone from another country with little knowledge of American life, Bruno is making all kinds of moves on men and has no problem showing some skin as well. I guess the only other little problem I had was that clearly a lot of scenes were staged and not so real, though some of that is explained in the special features.

The picture quality varies because of how the movie's filmed. A lot of segments are done with handheld cameras and certain scenes were grainy and had ghosting problems, but others looked great because they were shot on more professional cameras. Notably those in the beginning of the movie when Bruno's at fashion shows. The audio's good too, though it's really not worth mentioning much since you're watching this movie for laughs, not to test out your new home theater setup.

For people into doing comedy with reactions from the public, the special features are perfect. And for those who wanted to see more interviews, you're in luck. There's about a whole hour of deleted/alternate scenes here! A lot of them were cut for obvious reasons, like one with Bruno interviewing La Toya Jackson, where he does everything he can to get her phone so he can get Michael's number. There's even a deleted interview with a white supremacist. Trust me- it goes better than you might think. There are also a brief interview with talent agent Lloyd Robinson, and I don't want to spoil anything here but it's my second favorite extra. The main course of the special features is a picture in picture commentary track with Cohen and director Larry Charles. They explain tons of material and freeze the movie to go over how a scene was filmed, what was staged or how they got a certain reaction (the talk show bit is almost ruined by this), and since they stop the movie to talk, it extends the run time by about 26 minutes. This track is very crucial to those who want to do this kind of humor. Also, if you buy this movie, some versions come with a digital copy, but the code expired last year.

The first time I watched Bruno, I thought it was hysterical, and upon watching it a second time tonight, it mostly got a few light breathy laughs out of me, but it's still funny. Just like with Borat, most of what's hilarious here works the first time. This is one of those movies that's good to watch maybe once or twice a year, but more than that might kill it. But again, the movie isn't for everyone. If the infamous fight scene in Borat offended you, then good luck getting through the first 20 minutes of this one.",1308441600,,6093,4.525408348457351
3963856,1,B002P7UCJ0,"I liked Borat, I thought that the duping was credible.  I found this film actually not really about duping but about Cohen's paranoia that probably has been building over the years by his playing Ali G and Borat.  It reminded me of BBC documentaries about trying to investigate the Church of Scientology, well Cohen uses a few dialogic tricks or uses his body to suspend what might be a credible interview into a reason to gain an outrageous response, ok, so what?  Going in front of a TV audience with a baby and saying things that will outrage an audience would seem to make the baby, as he grows up, never want to see that footage of him being filmed... even if it does, he still will not have had a choice about it (his experience, at such a young age, will be of aggression towards someone who was holding him and displaying him - why? so Cohen can make a few more bucks?)  I don't really care that much about gayness or the non-gayness (anything about the gayness) - it wasn't really about that. I don't think Cohen really cared.  The gayness - trying to become straight, but not really, just seemed like Cohen being paranoid.  The whole thing was a catharsis for Cohen, why watch someone's attempt at dealing with a psychological state, albeit with a bit of fun? Things like repeating 'don't look at my crotch, lets keep this professional' - make me think just, 'so what?'  I kept on thinking why am I actually watching this?  If I want paranoia all I have to do is flip around on youtube, or facebook, or spend some time around humanities academics.  Lastly it has to be said, about Cohen or anyone else, its not funny to make jokes about Hitler and the Nazis any more.  It was ok for people who survived that surreal period in history to make jokes about him, or the SS.  Not now.  I couldn't care less if Cohen's Jewishness makes him think he is entitled to do that.  If the Nazis were as camp as Bruno, it also has to be remembered that the campiness of the Nazis (if they could be described that way) created an atmosphere of charisma that lead to just banal murder on an industrial scale.  Bruno's campiness is just banal, and not even in an interesting or funny way.",1302480000,,2180,4.403990024937656

Scenes like the velcro suit at the Milan fashion show should have been hillarious, but were really short and flat.

There are brief moments of genius and it gets better towards the end, but I don't get how it earned the accolade 'Funnier than Borat'.

The film cannot escape being compared to Borat since both are based around an outlandish character and peoples reactions to it and the films are built up in a very similar manner, Brno and his sidekick travel about and have a series of adventures.

In parts the movie is very funny but too many times it goes way over the top. Certainly this is in the build up of Brno's character but it stops being funny and becomes painful. Seeing how its best parts and cleverly paced humour can be so good it is hard to see such potential wasted.

At the end it doesn't come close to Borat and the 18 classification is deserved.

3963866,5,B002P7UCJ0,"Probably it's just a shtick Cohen happened to get into, but I kept wondering about Bruno, ""Why Austrian?"" For me, it's a part of the genius of a performer who exceeds explanation. Sacha Cohen Baron's movies always involve a clash of cultures. This movie shows him at the peak of his power as an artist, well beyond most others these days. What he achieves bears resemblance to Antonin Artaud, though he's far more ambitious and successful than anyone in the avant garde. I put him squarely in the tradition of Miguel de Cervantes. For all I know, Cohen is just in it for the dollars, milking slapstick through gay/straight stereotypes. If so, I hope he keeps milking.

The Austrian shtick not only allows Bruno easier entry to the hetero parties and scenes he crashes, it's another display of Cohen's unique talent with language. His cartoonish characters may not be the most important part of his movies. He pushes language (how it's spoken today) to hilariously absurd and inventive limits. In this movie, it's his casual twists of pigeon-German in conversations where he drops linguistic bombs about sex, anatomy, ethnic identity, hetero purity ... putting political correctness and avoided experience to all sorts of tests. The verbal daring and play is at least as liberating as his sometimes dangerous physical and situational adventures with the various unsuspecting adversaries he meets.

The movie is also a performance about politics. The idiocies of political ideologies is played out in the hummus/Hamas scene between hardcore adversaries whom Bruno brings together with a pun. The movie was made before the Tea Party was a political force, though Bruno engages its members' culture of virility, militarism, evangelicals, Ron Paul, all on the level of the personal.

In this spoof of a European fashion designer who has been defrocked of his cach due to a debacle he caused at a fashion show when he wore a suit made entirely of Velcro, Cohen satirizes the contemporary lust for fame and celebrity at any cost. Brno will attempt anything--from adopting a black baby (whom he names O.J.) to attending a swingers party posing as a heterosexual (and getting whipped by a merciless dominatrix in the process)--as he tries to satisfy his hunger for attention. The movie ends in an uncomfortably graphic display of manlove in an Ultimate Fighting venue, underlining the thin line between machismo and homoeroticism.

Synopsis
I'm not really sure. Bruno tried to make a sex tape with Ron Paul at one point, but I can't really think of a plot...

Review
Bruno is the kind of movie that I like to watch while doing something else. It's uncomfortable, it's weird, there's no real plot to follow. The funniest part in my mind involved male genitalia swinging in different directions, but that's because I think wang is funny.

My Reccomendation
We watched this because it was the only thing on TV at the moment. I would say only watch it if you have nothing else to do",1276473600,,552,4.349514563106796
3963875,3,B002P7UCJ0,"I have never seen any film as outrageous as this.  Sacha Baron Cohen plays a flamboyant homosexual and to call his behavior shocking is clearly an understatement.  True to the formula of his 2006 film ""Borat"", this film is full of setups designed to embarrass unsuspecting victims.  I honestly disagree with this technique, and I was tempted to turn off my TV where I was watching in on cable, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it because I was curious as t what would happen next.

There's a scene where he interviews parents who are trying to put their children in the movies.  They want their children in film so badly that they agree to the most disgusting situations.  There's a scene where he goes to some Alabama ministers to allegedly cure his homosexuality. There are several scenes where he supposedly adopts a black African baby and they goes on a talk show with an all African American audience.  There's a scene with some macho hunters, a scene with that starts with a anti-gay wrestling match and spirals into the two wrestlers being turned on, and a scene where he and his partner get themselves locked together in a hotel room and have to call the manager to get them unlocked.  This has to be embarrassing for the people who are innocent victims to his mockery and especially for celebrities such as Paula Abdul and Ron Paul who unwittingly are entrapped into this film.

Yes.  This film is disgusting.  Yes.  I was appalled.  And yet, I couldn't stop laughing.",1276473600,3,1483,4.636015325670498
3963876,4,B002P7UCJ0,"About halfway through, I was *definitely* considering giving Bruno an overall rating of 2 stars, but then the second half took place and the quality (and the humor) improved drastically.

First thing's first- expect a LOT of really immature, outrageous, and disgusting humor.  There's a *ton* of sexual references throughout this film, and most of them are definitely on the disturbing side.  Some of them are also quite funny as well, which explains why the rating I give the movie is 4 stars.

Only watch a film like this if you're at least 21 years old.  I certainly can't recommend Bruno to anyone younger than that, I'm afraid.

The first half didn't appeal to me because much of the storytelling focuses on Bruno roaming around Los Angeles and searching for famous celebrities.  Some of them, surprisingly enough, were actually willing to participate in this movie.  I won't reveal who these celebrities are, but to me it's amazing to see their participation in something so unbelievably ridiculous and far-fetched.  Let's be honest- Bruno *is* a completely ridiculous and silly film.  Nothing more.

The improvement comes during the second half of the movie when Bruno visits all kinds of different people in the Alabama area because he wants to become straight and enjoy the company of women.  He meets some hunters, a drill instructor from the army, and several other people (some of them religious).

Of course, his characters asks the most inappropriate and disgusting questions imaginable, making everyone feel quite embarrassed or foolish even being in the company of Bruno.  Of course that's the point of Sacha Baron Cohen's style of humor.  Like I said above- anyone younger than 21 should NOT be watching a film like this.  Absolutely not.  NO!!!

The movie turns around and becomes enjoyable when Bruno's character brings a baby to a talk show and reveals to the audience all the horrible examples he sets for the child by showing the audience pictures of when Bruno and the baby were involved in all kinds of outrageous activities.

I definitely could have done without all the nude scenes, though.  Nothing could have prepared me for those.  We're talking MANY scenes involving nudity here folks, not just one or two scenes total.

Not a classic, but good enough for some laughs.",1276300800,2,2298,4.960732984293194

There are so many crazy scenes with multiple jokes, innuendos, puns, double entendres, and overt (as well as subtle) jabs thrown in, that you will still laugh and giggle when you go over them, in your head, later on. There are too many embarrassing moments with clueless people not in on the jokes and their absurd/weirded out/shocked reactions to take in one sitting. I literally had to pause the DVD and walk away from the screen multiple times laughing due to my immense embarrassment at the clueless individuals being played upon by Bruno and his outlandish antics. There are also a plethora of deleted, alternate, and extended scenes included on the DVD that almost double the length of the movie and are not to be missed! Some scenes are so funny it hurts!

Bruno is ultimately a comedic social commentary that takes the ugliness of homophobia, the vapidity of fashionistas, the desperation of fame seeking parents, and the sexist double standards concerning male genitalia (borne out of homophobia/insecurity) and drags them kicking and screaming to their logical conclusions. It is subversive, as well as outrageous, comedy the likes of which is rarely seen. Sacha Baron Cohen is a comedic genius, willing to put himself in harms way in pursuit of where exactly is the line drawn and how far he can catapult past it.

I know a lot of people have complained about the ""graphic"" sex at the beginning and the nudity and whatnot, but honestly, those parts didn't bother me at all (and I'm a heterosexual female; didn't bother my boyfriend either).  Besides, R-rated movies today are littered with graphic female nudity, it's about time we evened up the playing field, eh?  If anything made me uncomfortable, it was the homophobic straight people.  I'd have to say I was most uncomfortable during the swingers party (when he's pestering that guy having sex) and when he goes to Alabama to become ""cured"".  I live in Alabama, and I'm honestly ashamed of some of the people shown (especially those during the cage match)...  Ultimately, Cohen pulls off a very delicate satire of American culture by using an over the top stereotype to tease out the hypocrisy, hatred, and homophobia within our society.

Many things can & have been said about this movie so I'll focus on something unexpected. At first I was taken aback by Bruno's aggressive sexual come-ons, such as to Ron Paul, as beyond obnoxious. It should be noted Bruno never initiated physical contact in these set-ups. Then I thought, how many times have I seen men do the same aggressive sexual come-ons to women - including touching and ass-slapping. Bruno acted as an unapologetic sexual aggressor the same way some straight men act toward women who suffer at their receiving end. Women rarely are able to respond to these men the way straight men do to gay men in the same situations. Moreover, Ron Paul, and others, did not complain about the gay advances afterwards in sexual orientation neutral terms like ""Brute"" or ""Crazy Sexual Aggressor"", but in gay epithets. If a woman acted in the same sexually aggressive manner, would he scream ""Brazen heterosexual, I'm running from here""? Would he just laugh ""Crazy floozy""? Some straight men feel it's OK to come-on to women without impunity but psychologically fall apart when they get the same come-ons by other men.",1267142400,6,1291,5.492462311557789

Simpson, calls Mel Gibson ""the Fuhrer"", and conducts the shortest interview ever with Harrison Ford, among other things.

Although none of the scenes in this film quite match the ""ROFLMAO"" factor of the hotel fight sequence from Borat, several come quite close.  Some highlights of this movie include a disastrous focus group presentation culminating with a surprise ""character"" shouting Bruno's name, an attempt to bed an unsuspecting Ron Paul for a celebrity sex tape, and an audience of drunk, redneck pro wrestling fans who don't quite get the ""man-slamming action"" they bargained for.",1266278400,3,876,5.154929577464789

Well, a mishap finds him ostracized from the European fashion community.  Having run out of options there, he travels to Los Angeles to become the next big celebrity.  However, he comes to find that America really isn't ready for his wild sense of humor.  Will Bruno be able to find acceptance for who he is?  Will he tame himself down to appeal to Americans?  Will this ""19 year old boy"" become the next sensation from sea to shining sea?

Most of the jokes could be telegraphed from a mile away, it was only just a matter of how long it would take before the prank was painfully executed.

In that aspect, Bruno did succeed. There was enough shock humor in the movie for me to laugh at & I enjoyed seeing the movie's few scenes where Bruno was unleashed upon an unsuspecting public. Why do I say a ""few scenes""? I say that because there were only a very few scenes where the characters interacted with the general public. Most of the ones I saw were either incredibly short & a lot of the other scenes were in situations where he interacted with other actors or showbiz professionals who appeared to be very much in on the joke. During the filming of the movie there were news stories about Sasha Cohen being recognized in his Bruno getup, which of course ruined any chance of getting good scenes for the film.

Unfortunately that's where the film failed. Without the valuable crowd reaction scenes, the film has to rely on Sasha Cohen's humor & while that may be enough to get through a 5-10 minute skit, it just wasn't enough to carry the entire movie. I'm not going to hate the movie for only going for the shock & crude humor, but it would have been nice if they'd tried to reach a little farther & do a little bit more with Bruno.

If you liked Borat, you'll probably like this film. I mean, come on... if you've seen Borat or pretty much anything that Cohen has been in, you know what to expect.

3963902,4,B002P7UCJ0,"After the movie Borat in 2006 Sacha Baron Cohen returned to the big screen in 2009 with another of his characters, gay Austrian (you read that right, it's not Australian) Bruno. 19 years old Bruno is known for hosting what is said to be the most famous German speaking television show outside of Germany ""Funkyzeit mit Bruno"", a show about fashion and for his flamboyant style. Bruno is doing well in the world of fashion but when he gets fired, his assistant leaves him and his lover dumps him he decides to leave for America in order to become famous by any means. When he comes to America Bruno tries a talent agency to get to stare in a big Hollywood movie and become famous, he unsuccessfully tries to starts a new television show, he does an interview, interviews people and he even tries to become straight amongst other things. He will do anything to get famous and is not ashamed of it which will end up in hilarious situations . Bruno to me was really funny, there were some moments were I laughed, others were I was in shock and others in which I didn't quite know what to think which I think was Baron Cohen's goal with this movie. There is a lot of nudity and other shocking things in this movie so be aware it's not for children and not everyone will like it because of it. Bruno goes far with homosexuality and if you are not comfortable with this then Bruno may not be for you. I have no problem with it at all and therefore enjoyed the movie and thought the character was great.

You may not like what Baron Cohen does but you can't deny his ability to re-invent himself, from his Ali-G character to Borat and others and keep what he does controversial, fresh and interesting . Bruno stands on its own and is not a Borat clone, there are a few similarities but the two are very different while retaining the same style of humor Baron Cohen is known for. If you are easily offended don't watch this, it's a different kind of humor that not everyone can appreciate.  When it comes to Bruno it's pretty simple you will either love it or hate it. The rating here on amazon may prove otherwise but it's because of the mix of very positive and very negative reviews, there is hardly any middle ground.",1262822400,23,2212,4.392682926829268
3963903,4,B002P7UCJ0,"For those of you who may be ""different"" or gay and have been hurt, intimidated or shunned by society, you will love this fun-filled jab at your tormentors! As a gay person, I admit to a sadistic thrill out of seeing every single uncomfortable straight person in the film, and those watching it. The hillbilly's, the conservatives, the testosterone-filled and religious nuts all get a taste of their own medicine in this 'Borat-as-a-gay' fun fest.

Some of the scenarios are screamingly funny (the 'channeling Milli Vanilli' scene comes to mind) and you really have to admire the fact that Sasha Baron Cohen is a straight man creating these outlandish situations. So much of it comes off the top of his head, and he has an amazing ability to stay in character.

If you are ""offended by male nudity""...then get a life!  I saw that phrase SO MANY times in the reviews on here! How many times have you been asked if you were offended by ""female nudity""? How many hundreds of movies have you seen with breasts (and ""other parts"") displayed across the big screen, larger than two-car garages? Did we gasp? Did we run home and complain about how ""offensive"" it was?  I doubt it. Bruno has a penis and we see it, big deal!  Well...it DOES have a urethra that talks...but still. He's an unconventional fella...

Why so many Sarah Palin-type Americans chose to view this film anyway, is a mystery. Bruno is UNMISTAKABLY gay on the cover, and they knew he was played by the same guy who was Borat.  What were they expecting, a Liberace concert? The truth?  Borat was offensive and STRAIGHT and everyone loved it. Bruno is offensive and GAY. And that, apparently, is 'not allowed.'

3963905,5,B002P7UCJ0,"I admit:
Until last night, I, too, was swayed by all the negative reviews to skip this movie. But I had nothing else to rent, so I picked this up, assuming I will lose 90 minutes forever on a movie that had not reached its full potential as a comedy.
WHOA!!! Boy, was I surprised!

When I willingly encounter a creative work, I try to meet it on its own terms. So, when I watch a COMEDIC film, I expect it to be funny, not morally uplifting, or reinforcing my day-to-day value system. I check my morality and decency at the door. I will accept anything in the story as long as it supports its objective: being funny.
THAT is the point of humor, is it not?
But it is a psychological truism that all humor has an underside that is anything but funny. One should remember this when dealing with this kind of humor: savage, extreme, but above all, intelligently conceived.

For many years, of the three fictitious characters that Cohen created -- Bruno, Ali G. and Borat -- Bruno was the least interesting/funny to me. But in this movie, he distills the essential ""offensiveness"" that all three characters have in common, and pours it all into Bruno for a very powerful effect.

The genius of this film, and of Cohen's work in general, lies in setting up the parameters where ordinary people like you and I can trigger an ""awkward""  or ""uncomfortable"" situation, and really show who we are as 'specifically socialized' creatures.
Specifically socialized: these situations are not objectively awkward or embarrassing or outrageous EXCEPT as they are socially accepted to be so. 'Losing face' in one culture may not amount to anything in another.
These situations are nothing more than some unexpected rips in the fabric of our socially agreed upon set of reactions. Cohen shows that we are not a whole lot more conscious or self-determining in our subjectivity than apes with their ""Alpha male"" social organization thing.

Thus, there is a dimension to this film that is actually NOT funny at all; in fact, quite thought-provoking. Cohen shows us, without forcing anything, the FULL extent of the collective ""insanity"" that structures the social norm. Watch all the people behaving the way they do: they (we all) cling to the Symbolic Order as manifested through FORM. The humor and the horror of all is in the way people react to situations and form - which are nothing but signs and symbols pertaining to the pecking order of one specific society.

This movie can be hilariously liberating if one can see through the absurdity of how and why people are so easily offended -- and people are most strongly offended usually by/about some concept that they cannot even articulate to begin with. Hence its inordinate power.

When you push something to its extreme, you get its opposite. If you don't believe me, try consciously making something ugly. Then see if you could make it even uglier. Not easy. You will discover that it's the same kind of work as trying to make something beautiful. This is satire pushed to the point of forcing it to yield its opposite: philosophy. Cohen shows you that the other side of 'funny' lies the 'terrifying' -- and here, the two are matched in direct proportion to each other. This is why those movies that make you chuckle pleasantly enough all the way from start to finish? in the end, they leave nothing to think about.
Is this movie funny? I thought it was hilarious, but then I would not put this in the same category of ""funny"" as, say, 'Wayne's World'.

If you let him, Cohen will help you see how ""absurd"" and ""arbitrary"" your so-called 'world-view', 'values', and 'beliefs' are when left unexamined by your own faculty of Reason and Humanity.",1261526400,7,3681,4.722741433021807

I laughed most of the time even at some of the more over the top situations - because the kids weren't around.

The ONE scene I did NOT appreciate was Bruno's attempt at seducing Ron Paul - a most decent, pure at heart, intelligent man. I will probably skip over it if I ever watch Bruno again and I really don't understand why it was included because RP maintains his dignity all throughout.

It would be hard to 'recommend' Bruno. I found at least one scene 'not funny' (see above), most of the movie tasteless but, at the same time, a lot of it was insanely funny - the kind of 'funny' you can't stop yourself from laughing out loud while feeling a little guilty at the same time. But such is the talent of Sacha Cohen.

On the DVD edition, besides the 82 minute movie cut, you get 40 (forty) minutes of deleted scenes, some of them as insanely funny as the scenes that made it into the movie plus 'extended' scenes, an interview with one of Bruno's victims and so on.

Few people are as good at what they do as Cohen is, and very few actors (including Oscar winners) are as creative, honest, daring, and most believable as this actor is. Take it from a man with a degree in Acting, Sacha Baron Cohen is one impressive actor. Half of the film is improved without any noticeable signs of second guessing. Bruno is an icon of comedic characters. He is as much a stereotype of the gay community as he is the German and fashion community, tackling three relateable social groups. Most importantly, he was created to poke fun at the ignorant and insensitive, making him as useful to our society as the movie is.

Bruno is easily the most unfairly treated movie of the year. The day it was released in theaters all that was said of it was in comparison to other comedies or to its predecessor, Borat. After the hype and praise that Borat received it is a travesty that this hilarious film was so quickly snubbed by society.
Yes, Bruno and Borat share a lot of similarities, and in all honesty if you like one and not the other it is because of your own prejudices and you just don't want to admit that.

Whereas Borat focused on ignorance in Southern USA and poked fun at how they relate to culture shock from a ridiculous Middle Easterner, Bruno pokes fun at the same people and how they relate to culture shock from a ridiculous foreign Homosexual.

Bruno not only captures with incredible grace the humor of ""I can't believe that really happened"" which can only appear in a documentary. Bruno also offers a great amount of written humor which pokes fun at such things as German accents, Homosexuals obsession with weight, ignorance towards celebrities, and the ridiculousness of the fashion industry.

3963912,2,B002P7UCJ0,"In Sacha Baron Cohen's BRUNO, the British comedian brings his eponymous character, a gay Austrian fashion reporter, to the big screen. After a scandal that sees the cancellation of his hit German-language show ""Funkyzeit mit Bruno"", the flamboyant journalist moves to America to make it big, and as always with Cohen the comedy mainly consists of interactions with everyday people completely unaware that Bruno is a put-on.

I have to say, enjoyed the Bruno sketches on Cohen's television series a lot more than this film. The problem starts with the way Cohen has redesigned the character. The television Bruno was suave and likeable -- women wanted him and men wanted to be him. You chuckled at how successfully he mingled in the fashion world when his own dress was so different. The new film Bruno, on the other hand, is rather pitiful, and the mixture of German and English he uses is unbelievable and obnoxious. The Bruno television sketches had a nice balance of lampooning the vacuous minds of the fashion industry (""cardboard theme"", anyone?) and the exaggerated discomfort of some people with behavior perceived as gay, but in making this film Cohen has chosen to go entirely with the gay issue, which can't sustain the whole movie on its own.

Hollywood comedies of late seem to be edited in a wildly inconsistent way, where scenes that might have been extremely funny end up heavily truncated and lose their punch. In a gag towards the end where Bruno calls a hotel attendant to his room only to reveal that he's locked to his lover in an outlandish S&M outfit and has lost the key, one gets the impression that this would have been funnier had the camera only been allowed to fully survey the bizarre setup of the room.

Although, it is tasteful to game unsuspecting people with short jests and ruses like on ""candid camera"", but extended skits are a bit taboo, they are often seeing by the audience as ""not funny"". This is what defines Cohen...beware.

This is why many, many, many people do not like this movie, claiming it is not ""funny"" but it only makes me wonder what they do find ""funny""? I bet they have no problem watching The Office, American Pie sequels or even Chuck (why is that show STILL on the air?) but I digress...In this film Sacha Baron Cohen pushes his character even further in the improvised and faux situations, Cohen is one part madman - one part brilliant thespian, he is one of those individuals who seems to occupy his own dimension while existing in this one (Andy Kaufman, Alfred Jarry, Monty Python). Is the movie always funny? Of course not. But is it bold and original? Of course so. This movie is all about perspective, be like a fly on the wall and stop being so judgmental, even if you're not impressed you should at least be entertained.

I suppose the underlying plot was how people react to homosexuality (and sex/censorship), but the way it was presented was not at all like Borat.

I am having a hard time coming up with anything to say other than the movie is sickening, revolting, and deranged. If you are considering watching this movie (video on demand) or buying it, you are throwing away your money.

After watching this movie, I have concluded that Hollywood is completely incapable of making a good movie. It's all trash and idiocy. Hollywood writers should go on a permanent strike. I won't be watching any more Cohen movies. The man (Cohen) has a serious mental problem.",1260835200,5,896,4.743589743589744

[I want to stress that I am not kidding. The above is quite true: I was in the process of eating some spaghetti from Fazoli's at a friend's place, and I merrily threw up a small amount into the plastic take-home container during the Man-Slammin' Max-Out. I've never laughed better.]",1260662400,3,408,4.368421052631579
3963919,5,B002P7UCJ0,"YES, YES, YES, it is DISGUSTING, NASTY, and FOUL. But that does not make it unfunny! You have to like politically incorrect humor to accept this movie. I for one, hate jokes to do with farting or the No. 2, so if this movie had a lot of those types of jokes, I'd give it one star.

First the core plot of the movie: Bruno, a gay Austrian fashion TV show host, has been fired from his job, and banned from the fashion industry after a wardrobe calamity. He goes to Hollywood to become a star. He wants stardom immediately, and will do anything to get it.

This movie is NOT for kids. This is not even really for adults! It includes a penis wagging/dancing, pubic hair, fake gay sex, S&M, swinging, nasty gay jokes, fake oral sex, and the put down of other races (even though Bruno seems to be so afraid to be racist). Although I was put off by it, I couldn't help but laugh so much I was choking! Part of the humor too is that Cohen and the movie are actaully ""going there."" I.E. Taking it to that level. This is the most outrageous movie I've ever seen!! If you thought Borat was disgusting, Borat isn't half disgusting as this! It reminds me of something the Family Guy creators would create if they were high on drugs! Not even Seth and Co. would go as far as this. But what Cohen is really doing is mocking what Hollywood is really like. With it's African baby adopting, and charities. Isn't that what comedy essentially is? Too expose the truth, while making you laugh?

The funniest parts for me (and I'll try not to give away too much)-- When his jealous, ex boyfriend walks in on him and a white supremacist having an interview, and thinks the two are an item.

When Bruno interviews a scientist through instant messenger (This is a bonus scene and not in the movie).

Bruno takes his newly adopted African baby on a talk show with an audience of mostly African-Americans (I loved this because Bruno said the most outrageous things most of us want to say).

The other good thing about this is you have to realize how immensely talented Cohen is. From Ali G to Borat to Bruno. He is a talented actor who can change his looks, accent, and his manner. All these characters act and look like three separate people acted them.

I say if you have a BIG sense of humor, not afraid of outrageousness, and like movies that are POLITICALLY INCORRECT(which is all this movie is about), then watch this movie.",1260662400,3,2404,4.38876404494382
3963920,4,B002P7UCJ0,"A very good comedy, Bruno, brings to the screen one of Sacha Baron Cohen's favorite characters, the Austrian homosexual model Bruno, who along with the British rapper Ali G and the Kazakh sex-starved journalist Borat, makes up his showbiz triumvirate.
Bruno takes the world by storm when he visits a number of countries before hitting the American shores and starts picking on as many different groups as possible; from fashion designers and hotel staff, to politicians and religious figures, to minorities and innocent passerby's.
The key to success is the indiscriminate use of caustic humor against all.
Very well written and very well presented, Bruno allows for an entertaining movie that can be watched over again. Nevertheless, he does have his own agenda, which as times is subtle and at times not so subtle. Moreover, there are scenes that are tasteless and provocative, which is probably Cohen's goal, i.e. to shock.
Overall, the setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all very good as long as it's taken with a grain of salt",1260662400,,1059,4.988700564971752
3963921,3,B002P7UCJ0,"So the critics and public had the long knives out for Cohen on this one, and it's been a bloody mess ever since.  Regardless, the movie is outrageously funny, and I had to pause it several times because I was laughing so hard I couldn't watch the screen.  Are there bits that don't work that well?  Yup.  Does it matter?  Nope.  What he manages to pack into this insane road show is so multi-faceted, fearless to the point of insanity (don't even ask about Bruno's adventures in the Middle East), and demented, you won't believe your eyes.  What's shocking is how the staged scenes with Bruno's assistant (and would be lover) Ludtz are so involving and, when Bruno rejects him, so unexpectedly serious and affecting.  Cohen is an authentic talent, but the combined forces of industry jealously and homophobia torpedoed this picture at the box office.

This movie only reinforces what homophobes already think and feel.  If you like watching an hour and a 1/2 of literally penis in your face, and this idiot running around half naked (or completely naked) then this movie is for you.

3963928,5,B002P7UCJ0,"I rented Bruno from NetFlix with mixed feelings. I had seen Cohen's other works, including Borat and the Ali G Show, both of which I found deceptively intelligent and political. His ability to make his characters' stupidity an incisive mirror which he holds up to society is mind-boggling. With Borat, I thought this form of comedy had reached it's highest point. I was wrong. Bruno goes further. Some are offended by the gratuitous male nudity. Deal with it. If looking at penises makes you deeply uncomfortable, you probably have issues that run deeper than Bruno. It's true that a lot of the content of the movie revolves around Cohen using his flamboyantly gay character Bruno to make conservative anti-gay types uncomfortable. This can be uncomfortable for the viewer as well, but with the ultimate pay-off of revealing America's deep-seated homophobia and questioning it.

SPOILER WARNING

The film's finale gathers a large number of red-neck cage-fight enthusiasts in an arena for an event hosted by ""Straight Dave"", Bruno's straight alter-ego. When they get a touching (if gratuitously gay) scene of male-male reconciliation and love, the fans go crazy with disgust. Some of the audience leave, some yell violent hate slogans, some throw drinks at Bruno and his lover. Several of the fans looks shocked and betrayed, several of them comically wearing ""Straight Dave"" T-shirts they'd gotten for the event. I even saw a few in the crowd who looked like they understood the point that Cohen was making. People who were suddenly more disgusted by the gross display of homophobic violence on the part of the fans than the homosexual love that was taking place within the cage.

While his methods may be questionable, I feel America is indebted to Cohen for his bravery, and that he is one of the single largest contributors to intelligent social commentary through comedy today.",1260057600,54,1881,5.061290322580645

3963931,1,B002P7UCJ0,"As a fan of ""Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia"" and ""South Park"", I am totally on board with offensive and raunchy humor. Unfortunately Bruno is just plain stupid. Any idiot with a video camera could have made this movie. The attempt at sarcastic humor is so lame. Sure, there are a few moments in the film that make you smile because its so ridiculous (like the scenes with the adopted black baby) but this is not something to add to your movie collection. Some of what made Borat funny are the people's reactions that he came in contact with during the film. But in this film, you can actually feel sorry for these people. Bruno was being completely vulgar and these people were actually polite for the most part. In contrast with Borat, Bruno is also NOT a likeable character. I was just waiting for the film to end. Just a sidenote, this film also felt more like a movie and less of a mockumentary like Borat. The extra dramatic elements bored me. Too bad for Cohen. I guess this film was just over my head because I didn't get the point of it at all.

I will warn you that this film does have very graphic sexual content and male nudity that is very in your face so if you're usually a laid back kind of parent that allows your kids to watch R rated movies, you may want to watch this one on your own first to see if this is appropriate for your family.",1259971200,10,1357,4.280155642023346

Enough to make enemies of almost every demographic. Totally UN-PC. So it's not surprising so many people don't get his absurdly outrageous humor. Or maybe because so many people are targets of his humor. Personally I needed oxygen I was laughing so hard. I think those who can think for themselves will be laughing at this classic. If you let others do your thinking for you you won't like it.,1259884800,5,535,4.826086956521739

STARRING: Sacha Baron Cohen, Gustaf Hammarsten, Clifford Banagale and Josh Meyers

WRITTEN BY: Sacha Baron Cohen, Anthony Hines, Dan Mazer, Jeff Schaffer and Peter Baynham

DIRECTED BY: Larry Charles

Rated: R
Genre: Comedy
Release Date: 10 July 2009

I don't even know where to begin folks. Wow, what a movie! Um, I guess I'll start by saying: DO NOT WATCH THIS WITH CHILDREN OR ANYONE EASILY OFFENDED.

Chances are even if you aren't normally easily offended, you may find at least one moment in Bruno offensive. While I did not, I can completely understand where people would be offended and that's the point of this film. It's supposed to be offensive. If you get upset, then you are letting the filmmakers win. It's a lot like Jackass and Punked; people getting upset and acting stupid in response to it; that's what makes the comedy work so well.

If you liked Borat that does not necessarily mean you will enjoy Bruno. They both star Sacha Baron Cohen and were created by the same filmmakers and are a similar breed of film, yes; but Bruno is vastly in another dimension of inappropriate all together.

Sacha Baron Cohen plays Bruno; a gay European television host. Things haven't quite worked out the way he had hoped with his career and matters only get worse when he is thrown out of a fashion show and loses his job with the network. Even his boyfriend (an oddly short Asian man) wants nothing more to do with him.

He decides to head to America in hopes of becoming famous. From there we follow him around as he tries desperately to achieve stardom.

Some of the footage captures real life people that do not know who Sacha Baron Cohen is and think that he is in fact Bruno. He takes advantage of this and everyone unsuspecting of him falls victim to the pranks. But what is so great about this film is that Bruno does not make anyone look like an idiot. He only puts himself out there and allows others to embarrass themselves.

At one point in the film for example, he invites Paula Abdul over to have an interview in hopes of gaining some attention from the press. Paula Abdul shows up and it's really her. Bruno's assistant has made a mistake and there is no furniture for her to sit on. Bruno has a back-up plan. He has the landscaping people come inside and pretend to be furniture. Paula Abdul walks in and is at first taken aback. Bruno explains to her that it is okay; he is paying them and tells her to sit on the backs of one of the workers. She does and continues on with the interview. He actually gets her to talk about how she cares about people and would like to give back to them and this and that as she is sitting on this man's back for her interview! She knows the camera is there for sure but she thinks it's just another interview. This is clearly not staged; she really did do this.

I'm told that Sacha Baron Cohen is a master at getting people to sign release forms to the use of his footage in very sneaky ways; and that he has some of the best attorneys backing him to ensure that he gets his footage and is untouched by the law while doing so. He didn't do anything wrong here; he just outsmarted Paula Abdul, (which apparently isn't that difficult to pull off) and allowed her to make a complete fool of herself.

Some of the scenes are obviously staged and fake; such as the sequence when he attends a Military training camp in order to become straight so that he can be famous. They would never allow a camera into a facility like that to follow a cadet around through his training, but it is very humorous nonetheless and several other moments are real.

If you are wondering what about the film is to be so offensive, then I have a lot to tell you.

The most obviously offensive stereotype in the film is the way he depicts gay men in general. It is completely over the top and disgusting. He does things that hopefully none of us have ever seen before and the film is filled with obscene nudity and at times people actually having sex on camera.

I honestly have no idea how this film is only rated R. I wouldn't be surprised if his lawyers were able to throw a few curve-balls here as well, with the MPAA. Showgirls received an NC-17 Rating. Bruno makes that film look like The Little Mermaid in comparison.

Perhaps my favorite part in the film is where he visits a psychic and asks if he can communicate with his dead lover. The psychic tells him that he is in the room with him. Bruno asks if he can give him a kiss and the psychic says ""Of course"". He then proceeds to act out with the thin air, this entire disturbing and graphic gay sexual encounter. There is no one else there but it is very raunchy and will offend many. I personally could not stop laughing, especially seeing the psychic's face. If the psychic really is a psychic and believed the ghost was really there, then I'm sure he must have had an even wilder show than us.

If it's not the gay community that will be appalled then it's the religious folks who will want to rebel against the film. The film is directed by the same man who brought us Religulous, (Larry Charles) so you can imagine where that man stands religiously. There are some scenes where Bruno goes to a Christian man who attempts to turn him straight and Bruno says some off the wall remarks. Then again, I'm sure not too many genuine Christians will be watching this film to begin with, so maybe there won't be too many complaints from them.

Then there is the constant racial and heritage humor throughout the film. He refers to Osama Bin Laden as a dirty wizard. He adopts a small black baby and purposely plays violent rap music with excessive profanity for the child to listen to. When asked what the child's name is, he says he gave the baby a traditional African name: OJ. And he constantly pokes fun at Europeans with his ridiculous accent and mispronunciation of words; but again, it's all hilarious. Just try and appreciate the fact that he never breaks character and only has one chance to catch a reaction from people.

Many won't find it funny at all and others will. If you don't find it amusing, the thing to do here is the same you should do with anything else you find offensive; don't watch it!",1259884800,2,6206,4.41768826619965

In short, this is a boring and empty movie that tries to be funny through deploying bad taste to the extreme but ends up looking like something a 10-year-old might have thrown together. Whereas Borat was genuinely funny in many places, Bruno is just dull and flat and empty.

He really believes that exagerating every gay stereotype, and then forcing it in the faces of people who are not comfortable with homosexuality in an effort to provoke violence is somehow going to bring a new understanding and tolerance to gay rights issues.

However, it was such a waste of time, that it was not even worth watching it for free.
I have gay family members and friends who I love.  I just don't see the humour.  I would think there might be a backlash against gays from folks who see might see the 4 guys in the hot tub holding up what appears to be a baby upside down in front of someone's face, as gay values.  To be gay is not to be a pedophile.
This movie presents homosexuality in a gross offensive perverted way.  It should have been more appropriately rated XXX instead of R, and a MATURE or ADULT label put on the cover.
I truly did not know what was I about to see. Who is responsible for rating this film?
...And it would be better kept behind the counter or in an Adult section of the video store, rather than being placed in the rental store along with other more acceptable movies.

 Cohen's gig is to bring out the foibles in 'fellow' humans so that they can be mocked. The man is basically a sociopath who makes a living using other people, shocking them and, if at all possible, degrading them. In Bruno and Borat, the man wreaked havoc across lives of dozens of ordinary people so that HE could have his 5 minutes in the sun. That, my friends, is psychopathy. Is it such a revelation that some people are racist and others homophobic? Do you feel better about yourself after watching those hapless swingers, hillbillies and Ron Paul?

Watching the film we laughed - like you did - yet all i feel now is emptiness. There seems to be a fundamental ugliness within Cohen himself, like the man has a dirty soul which soils everything it touches. We laugh, but we laugh from that dark place filled with Schadenfreude of the unlived adolescent. Cohen understands that very well and panders to it, with his hordes of lawyers and enablers. So I would not call this comedy, or 'film'. It is more of a morality play along the lines of medieval jesters, Fools Nights and saturnalia when human deviancy was allowed to touch the light of the day. Only, with Sacha, deviancy is the norm, and on the surface. Too bad for his friends. And audiences.",1259366400,11,1478,4.590909090909091

Still Bruno was not without its moments. Watching the test audience for Bruno's TV pilot was worth a chuckle (""abort it!"") and the dazed hostility of the drunken crowd of rural ladies and gents in the cage fight at the film's end more than made up for the plethora of lackluster scenes we had to sit through.

3963953,2,B002P7UCJ0,"Its hard to tell if Bruno is a modern social commentary on homophobia, or simply one long gay joke, using the homosexual male as a punching bag for cheep laughs and gags.  I'm on the fence, and because I'm on the fence, I'm disappointed in this movie.  Bruno was a character in the very known but rarely seen Da Ali G Show.  His gags always were a play on homosexuality, in that he was often playing on the homophobia of the deep south, conservative, or frat boys, using the fear and uncomfortableness with homosexuality as a funny and social commentary.  The movie seems to never balance this comedy in the same way.  While there are many very funny parts along these lines (the gay converters springs to mind), they are bookended with jokes at the expense of gay men.  Sure, some will find this funny, but its an old type of humor that really promotes the behavior of the homophobic that the movie seems to condemn.

Other than this, the movie is watchable, though not particularly great.  There are moments that are very funny, but many times I felt that the movie was trying to out gross and out offend Borat.  As if the bar had been set, and the only way to be funny is be more shocking than before.  This resulted in a number of gags fall flat, or simply exist to offend.  Am I expecting too much from the guys who brought the world Borat?  Probably.  But that doesn't change that this movie was made a mediocre movie as a result.

Overall, the movie has its moments, but never succeeds in becoming something special.  If you're looking for a comedy based on shock jokes, you might want to watch it.  Otherwise, probably best to watch something else.",1258934400,4,1656,4.47

The feature only runs 81 minutes, so if it left you wanting more, it's here.
  The ""professional"" reviewers who reported that this was a ""one joke movie"" are either morons or too shallow to understand intelligent satire and irony that can be both offensive and clever. While there are several envelope-pushing jokes about gay sex, there is so much more to this movie. Still, this is not a movie for everyone. If you didn't like ""Borat"", avoid this.
  Cohen's ability to keep in character and improvise in the face of sheer madness was brilliant. It was downright scary to see how incredibly lame some people can be. The real sickness in the movie is revealed more by the ""real"" people, with the exception of the African-American TV talk show audience and the test audience for Bruno's celebrity TV show. They were the only ones who responded like credible human beings. The celebrities (especially the models and designers) were brain dead on arrival.  The politicians? What were they thinking? Is there anything they won't do for attention? But the most chilling scenes (in the film and extras) is where parents agree to do anything to get their children a few moments of fame. There is nothing ""gay"" about this or several other set ups, they just show how messed up, desperate and shallow people can be - even when juxtaposed with one of the most outrageous film characters ever.
  If this was a silent film, I still would have laughed and cringed throughout the film. The costumes Bruno displays are unbelievable, and the fact that ""real"" people in the film don't see this is too much. The Hasidic Jew costume just about did us in!

3963957,2,B002P7UCJ0,"After seeing and loving Borat, I had to see Sasha Baron Cohen's next movie, Bruno. My friends who saw the movie in theaters gave me mixed reviews, but none of them disliked the movie, so I expected it to be a tier below Borat.

Boy, was I wrong.

Problems abound, but the main one seems to be that Cohen is trying to top himself by using a formula set up by Borat. He uses cluelessness to make his character get into a variety of insane situations. His friendship and/or love affair seems to disintegrate due to constant abuse only to be reunited near the end of the movie. Even his targets seem to be the same. The redneck rodeo scene from Borat parallels the redneck wrestling scene in Bruno.

The format just doesn't work for various reasons. We simply don't care for Bruno the way we cared for Borat, which makes sitting through this man's hijinx difficult. Also, the funny situations seem to be staged, and I suspect many of them were. In a world of prank-based reality shows, it is no wonder people are wary of a 6'3"" eccentric gay man with a put-on German accent.

Shock can indeed be funny, but only if it is correctly played, and instead of simply being funny through outrageous actions, it seems that Cohen is trying to be shocking, and that is neither funny or entertaining.

The trailers included some of the best bits of comedy in the movie. There are a few laughs that couldn't be previewed because of their raucousness, but the few laughs that are present in the movie aren't worth sitting through the rest of it for.

I'm sure that's because ""the word was out"" that this movie was by the same guy that did Borat and expectations were set for some pretty crude stuff. And, indeed, crude stuff is what Bruno delivers. It's offensive. It's hilarious. It'll make you squirm and say ""oh my God"" dozens of times throughout. It'll have you wondering why you're laughing, but you will laugh.

The suggestion that Bruno is the funniest movie or character to come along in years is way overrated. The Bruno character is funny. But what is funnier is watching the reaction to the character by the people that he is duping. If what you're really after are public reactions to pranks and gags, you can certainly get it all for free on YouTube. Cohen just has a better knack for executing his gags on VIPs.

It still amazes me how such a very small amount of the US population either doesn't have HBO or simply had never tuned into HBO's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Da-Ali-G-Show/dp/B000JBXH82/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Da Ali G Show</a>. Sasha Baron Cohen didn't break new ground with the Bruno character. The characters were a regular part of Da Ali G Show introduced to US viewers via HBO in 2004. Cohen's Ali G character (a stereotypical hip-hop, British ghetto banger TV host), Bruno (the gay Austrian fashion TV host) and the Borat character (the Kazakhstani documentarist) all have the same modus operandi....

....And that modus operandi is Socratic Irony. The characters deliberately feign ignorance in order to expose weakness in another's position. The result most of the time is hilarity. As I said, whether it's Bruno, Ali G or Borat, the laughs are less to each character's behavior and more to the reaction of the person being duped. Cohen goes way over the top (over the line?) by exploiting the commitment that people have to being politically correct; Cohen is often hard pressed to find anyone to just step up and challenge the ridiculous actions, opinions and questions that Cohen's characters come up with. Cohen's characters' naive stupidity make his victims look equally stupid...Socratic Irony. (The only victim that I ever saw that had enough intelligence to walk out of the situation before it got started without any regard to whether or not he was offending the Cohen character was Donald Trump when he was being interviewed by the Ali G character.)

So don't be fooled into being offended by any of the Cohen characters. They are not real; the man behind the mask really isn't that stupid. He's trying to make YOU look stupid. And if you take Cohen's characters seriously, you will indeed look stupid. You see? Socratic Irony.",1258675200,5,2952,5.287846481876333
3963963,2,B002P7UCJ0,"Bruno: 4 out of 10: I have to admit I am more than a bit disappointed here. Bruno has its share of laugh out loud moments but it simply does not have those great memorable scenes that made Borat such a treat.

One cannot help comparing Bruno to Borat since in many ways they are the same story. Borat worked because the character was, at least on a movie logic level, believable. He was played as an innocent whom one could root for; even if he had some terrible values upon reflection. He was a lovable character.

While Borat has an innocent air about him and a charismatic travelling companion, Bruno is as characterized a horrible human being from the get go with a milquetoast traveling companion.

Bruno is a flamboyantly gay Austrian fashion host that is so horrible, one simply feels nothing but sympathy for Sacha Baron Cohen's victims. When you start feeling sorry for Ron Paul and Anti-homosexual Christian deprogrammers the movie has clearly gone of the rails.

Cohen tries to infuse Bruno with countless shots of male gentalia to embarrass (one supposes) his audience, Alas none if it is as cringe inducing as the naked wresting from the first movie (Come to think of it, nothing on earth is as cringe inducing as that scene) and nothing in Bruno comes anywhere close to being that funny.

While there are certainly scattered laughs throughout the film, Bruno is more in the style of an old Mondo Cane movie than a comedy. It is more about making the audience and his victims uncomfortable than provoking any mirth or insight.

When I watched Borat, I would tell myself if I met the character on the street I would be polite to him as well. While watching Bruno I was shocked no one punched him in the face.",1258502400,4,1720,4.586319218241043
3963964,4,B002P7UCJ0,"My wife and I saw ""Borat"" when it was in the theaters. It was an extremely funny movie and part of the fun was the audience. We listened to the almost continuous laughter from some people while watching others walking out in disgust. Strange scene. We enjoyed the ""Borat"" movie enough that we bought the DVD and watched it several times again. In some ways the movie was even funnier the second and third times when we could see all sorts of details we missed in the first showing.

Since we enjoyed ""Borat"" so much, we looked forward to ""Bruno."" Unfortunately, when ""Bruno"" came to the nearby theaters we were too busy and couldn't see it. No problem, we thought, we'll just get the DVD when it comes out. A couple months later we purchased the DVD and watched it last night. It's a funny movie, without doubt. But it's not nearly as funny and as well put together as ""Borat."" Maybe part of the reason is in that we didn't see it in the theater. This kind of movie benefits from audience reaction, and siting at home just doesn't mark up. Also, perhaps after viewing ""Borat,"" out ex[ectations were too high and ""Bruno"" just couldn't live up to them.

In any case, the plot, if that's what you call it, was that of a flamboyant gay fashionista attempting to gain fame in a variety of bizarre ways. It was gross and offensive, very much in the manner of ""Borat."" We loved it! Warning: if you're easily offended by full frontal male nudity and hilarious gay sexual scenes, don't buy the DVD. If you're open to really outrageous humor, sight gags and bizarre behavior and Borat-style trapping of innocent victims, then you may find this a hilarious movie. Whether it's funny or not depends on you as much as on the movie.

In short, we enjoyed the ""Bruno"" DVD, but not as much as we enjoyed ""Borat."" However, we'll reserve full judgement until we watch it a couple more times.

3963965,4,B002P7UCJ0,"Borat and Bruno have much in common:  they are foreign idiots who cannot comprehend the U.S., yet travel all over it in an attempt to get to know the people better and to become famous.  Sacha Baron Cohen outdoes himself again as Bruno, the hapless, flamboyant Austrian who fails at fashion, then at acting, then in several other ways before cutting a hit single for charity with such stars as Bono, Elton John, Slash, and more.  On the way to that, he learns a lot about American homophobia, gay conversion ministries, test audiences for TV pilots, the perils of interviewing celebrities, and more.  The funniest bit involves O.J., an African baby that Bruno adopts, in a sense, after trading an iPod for him.

3963967,2,B002P7UCJ0,"As a whole, this was an absolutely terrible movie.  However, with that said, a few parts of the movie were funnier than anything I've seen in a LONG time.  One part in particular had me laughing so hard, I had to put it on pause and laugh it out for 5 minutes.

About half of the movies/jokes didn't go over very well, and ended up being filler in the movie, even though that wasn't the intention.  Unfortunately, with a film like this, part of the humor is the people's reaction to Bruno's antics.

The shock value in this movie is through the roof.  I've read other reviewers say it and I'll say it as well: Bruno isn't for the easily offended, or for kids.  There's a tremendous amount of male nudity, and even some female nudity.

There were a few bright spots, like I said before.  Some extremely funny moments, but as a whole, the movie didn't deliver the goods. But if you want a few HARD laughs and not much of a movie itself, watch this film!",1258329600,4,951,4.297752808988764

3963970,4,B002P7UCJ0,"Let's get one thing straight: BRUNO is not BORAT, even though, at times, it tries to be.  This is the main weakness of the film, and can be difficult to get around; Sacha Baron Cohen is a brilliant comedian, and there are some truly original moments here--the adoption bit; the interview with the ""terrorist;"" the baby photo shoots; and so much more--but viewers will often find themselves thinking: ""I could just as easily re-watch BORAT.""

That aside, BRUNO is a...well, I was going to say a ""delightful"" film, but thirty seconds of a man waving his impressively-sized junk in your face isn't necessarily ""delightful"" (though if you think it is, then by all means, see this film).  Let me say this: BRUNO is a film you should watch, unless you have certain opinions...in which case, you'd best stay away.  (If you fall into this latter category, you shouldn't even be reading this review; odds are, you're only here to give this film--and the positive reviews about it--a low rating.  Shame on you.  Shame.)  I had some friends who were completely put off; they said there was too much, er ""male anatomy"" in the film.  Yet, here is the subtle genius of BRUNO: there was more nudity in BORAT (which these particular friends thoroughly enjoyed, despite the fact the film was mocking them the whole time).  BRUNO is a thoroughly offensive movie (at times trying too hard to be so), but it lacks the certain sarcastic kick of BORAT.

Ah, hell.  I'm comparing the two films again, aren't I?  Nevermind; just see BRUNO.  It's a double-edged jab at the homophobic underpinnings of America.  A lot of the film is window-dressing (he doesn't have to be an Austrian fashion designer, though wanting to be the ""most famous Austrian since Hitler"" is certainly a nice bit, as is the ""Brad Pitler"" reference, and saluting ""mein fuhrer"" to a picture of Mel Gibson), but overall it's a thought-provoking piece that is certain to offend your tender sensibilities.

And it really doesn't matter how they react - if they're shocked, it's supposed to be funny and if they try to ignore the outrage, it's also supposed to be funny. But when people react pretty much as anyone would, where's the humor?

To the extent Bruno is funny, and it is at times, it's mostly because you're laughing at the sheer nerve of Sacha Baron Cohen more than anything else. And even that, after a while, wears thin.

The problem for Cohen is that most people in the movie, confronted with confrontational spectacles make every effort to remain polite. With the exception of a few obvious targets (""gay-curing"" clergymen, for example), most people are actually pretty, dare I say, tolerant. Even the central casting rural bigots turn the other cheek (as it were).

It started out very well, Sasha is brilliant as the flamboyant ubber gay ""Bruno"", showing up at fashion events and then getting himself banned by wearing an all Velcro suit and pulling a ton of clothes off a rack and falling out on the catwalk to a chorus of boos from the shocked models and photographers, it really is funny. But very soon this film runs out of steam and is forced to creak along for another 90 plus minutes.  Picture an animal run down on the highway but not quite killed, it squirms and writhes around waiting to be put out of its misery, it is truly painful to watch.  I cannot remember a more cringe inducing experience at the movies, this film makes ""Good Luck Chuck"" seem watchable. After being blacklisted and fired from his fictional Austrian TV show ""Funkytime"" or something, Bruno decides to go to Los Angles to be famous.  Through some sort of chicanery he manages to hire some sort of agent or another to help him get discovered. Anyone unfortunate enough to have seen even five minutes of one episode of ""Living Lohan"" or ""Keeping up with the Cardashions"" (spelling)?  Knows the bottom-feeding world of ""reality TV"".  But somehow this agent/producer/buffoon thinks ""Bruno"" has something to offer, even though in an interview Bruno clearly reveals himself to be less then worthless and at best a waste of time. OK, Bruno is gay, we get it, but this alone is not funny or worthwhile.  He desperately wants fame, big deal, lot's of people want to be famous or think they do, the fact that he is homosexual has nothing to do with his desire to be famous, but he seems to think it's funny to make endless reference to his anus (having his butt waxed while he is talking to the clueless producer) etc. And why would anyone involved with this business take him seriously? This person, whom I assume is a real film/TV producer, should A. Know who Sasha Baron Cohen is. B. Know when a no talent idiot is wasting his time, but still he goes to the effort of setting up a test audience to watch a show he has never seen, a reality show where Bruno interviews celebrities, a hapless Paula Abdul is ambushed for an interview.  Now let's hold the phone right there.  Isn't there much comic gold to be mined from the American Idol judge who, by her own hand, has made a fool of herself many times over?  How can one miss a target like that?  But when given a brilliant opportunity like this, the usually brilliant Coen who, in Borat, elevated fake interviews to a fine art, seems unable to shoot fish in a barrel.  His idea of humor is to have no furniture so he has several (I assume) illegal aliens on hands and knees to be used as human chairs ha ha.  Paula leaves abruptly and the scene is over, what a waste. None the less this ""producer"" gets a test audience to watch his show where Bruno dances in various skimpy outfits and then, inexplicably, waves his penis, yes his penis to a techno beat while a shocked group of test viewers squirm and look shocked, some get up and leave, I don't blame them.  This leads to an endless series of increasingly desperate, sad moments where Bruno keeps making passes at straight guys or simulating various gay sex acts, one with a medium who claims to channeling the spirit of one the Millie Vanilli guys, it's not funny it revolting and should have been shortened or cut all together, but the scene just hangs there and withers and dies on the screen while the audience groans, what garbage.  The key to the success of ""Borat"" was that people didn't know they were being put on; the failing of Bruno is that everyone is or should be in on the joke.  Is there anyone with a TV who has not watched these Christian yahoos claim to have ""cured"" someone of homosexuality?  If not, they might find Bruno's visit to the Pastor who says ""these lips are made for praising Jesus"" funny or shocking but no one else would.  His visit to a ""swingers club"" is just plain weird and it is a mystery to anyone why someone would make such a pathetic,  impossible to watch film.

Sacha Baron Cohen has more or less completely recycled the set-up of his previous film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Borat-Cultural-Learnings-of-America-for-Make-Benefit-Glorious-Nation-of-Kazakhstan-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000MMMT9G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Borat - Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;(foreign fish-out-of-water television host journeys to America and inadvertently offends the social, cultural and sexual mores of it's citizens) and the results are even more controversial, daring and knuckle-bitingly funny than those of that film.

Bruno Gehard is the openly gay ""nineteen"" year old host of uber-elitist Austrian fashion and lifestyle show, 'Funkyzeit'. His word is law and one discursive flick of his fey wrist can make or break a career. However, Bruno finds himself ostracised from his coterie of contemporaries and sycophants following an embarrassing incident involving a catwalk show and an all-velcro suit during Milan fashion week.

Determined to reclaim his throne as self-proclaimed king of cool, Bruno, accompanied by his fawning, devoted assistant's assistant, Lutz (the only person not to turn his back on him), journeys to America to become a celebrity and fufil his avowed mission of becoming ""the most famous Austrian since Hitler"".

His attempts to court fame and notoriety included attempting to lure former presidential candidate Ron Paul into performing in a gay sex tape; abortively trying to launch a television show in which he comments on the potential retardation of celebrity foeti; attempting to broker peace in the middle east by forcing a former chief of Israel's 'Mossad'  and a Palestinian minister to join hands whilst he serenades them with a wince-inducingly awful ballad of the 'Heal The World' variety; attempting to get himself kidnapped by Muslim extremists on the understanding that the subsequent hostage video will be broadcast worldwide; adopting an African child and informing the predominantly black audience of a Jerry Springer style show that he has chosen to give him the 'traditionally African' name of ""O.J."" and, ultimately, deciding to go 'straight' in an attempt to emulate the success of notoriously heterosexual celebrities such as Tom Cruise, John Travolta and Kevin Spacey.

It would be fair to say that there is something in this film to offend everyone: white, black, gay, straight, muslim, christian, jew - nothing is left sancrosanct and no sacred cow is left unscathed by Baron Cohen's lacerating satirical insights.

As with his previous film, and in keeping with his only real recent contemporary, the late Andy Kaufman,  much of the fascination of the film lies in attempting to discern which of the events have been staged and which have not: the attempted seduction of Ron Paul has the awful, stilted awkwardness of reality about it, as does Bruno's meeting with the Mossad chief and the Palestinian politician...but did Baron Cohen really meet with Ayman Abu Aita, leader of the 'Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades', and attempt to incite a hostage-taking by informing him that ""you have sun-damaged hair"" and that ""your king Osama looks like a dirty wizard""? Did he really flounce through the concourse of an airport in an apparently fundamentalist country wearing that shockingly camp outfit? Were the two Hollywood PR agents that he meets in LA really that incapable of stringing a coherent sentence together? Did the mothers of a group of toddlers whom he interviews for a job in a photo-shoot with little ""O.J."" really actually accede to his request for their children to appear in a 'concentration camp' spread?

In the latter case we can only hope not. But in any case, I advise you to see this film and make your own mind up, as it really is the scathing attack on fame-obsessed culture that the west has been crying out for and it really is incisive satire of the most fearless kind.",1249257600,8,4248,5.414523449319213

Not if you have any class or taste or sense of moral values. And who would want to see this over and over?
It would be like undergoing 81 minutes of root canal over and over again.

And certainly don't bring your teenagers, no matter how funny they tell you it's going to be.

The jokes were tripe and one note. Interactions between Bruno and people were occasionally funny, but nothing worth seeing at today's theatre prices.

The use of gratuitous, over the top, male frontal nudity and idiotic swinging it around is what finally got me to stop watching altogether.
Why isn't this film rated NC-17 or X or whatever the worst is?
Well, it did from what I understand, have that rating but it was EDITED!!?? And given an R!!??

This film is meant to insult and offend everyone and it does just that, but without a standup act or story or plot behind it, it comes off simply as a hate crime.
Every tired old gay joke in the book is employed and there is no sign of the supposed Genius of BORAT.

3963986,4,B002P7UCJ0,"""Bruno"", starring Sacha Baron Cohen and directed by Larry David (""Borat""), is a hilarious film. A raunchy, funny, sexually explicit, very politically incorrect look at Cohen's Austrian Gay reporter, a character he created for his HBO show. But it also seems to revisit much of the same territory we already experienced with Borat. Some of the material is worth a revisit, but much seems tacked on, as though they were trying to create a film of a certain length.

Bruno is an Austrian television personality with his own show. When he destroys a fashion designer's show at Milan Fashion Week, he is fired, his Asian pygmy boyfriend dumps him and he has to reevaluate his life. He quickly decides to travel to Hollywood, to become famous. His assistant, Lutz (Gustav Hammarsten), whose love for Bruno remains unrequited, follows him and they set about trying to make Bruno famous. Their first step is to find an agent. Bruno will interview the biggest stars in the world and make a pilot for his new television show. He sets up an interview with Paula Abdul who is a bit shocked when she learns she is expected to sit on top of a Mexican Gardener posing as a chair (Bruno and Lutz don't have furniture yet). When they show the pilot to a test group, it becomes apparent Bruno was unable to find any celebrities and he sets off on a cross-country journey to meet people and try to become famous.

Bruno is quite a character. Cohen has a twisted mind and there seems to be nothing he won't do or try to generate a laugh. There is a short sequence at the top of the film depicting Bruno and his boyfriend having sex and it is pretty twisted and shocking, which makes it all the more funny. But the film is also appropriately rated ""R"". Even though they blur out a lot of things, they also seem to leave many shocking images in.

As the film gets going, you begin to experience a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. Especially when Bruno begins his cross-country journey and starts to insinuate himself into the lives of real people who don't realize he is playing a character. This is exactly what made ""Borat"" so fresh and funny. And it works here as well. Bruno meets up with some hunters in a rural town and shares an interesting conversation with them around the campfire one night. Later, he stumbles across a swingers club and a dominatrix who wants Bruno bad. These are funny bits, but they just seem a bit recycled.

Also, it seems like ""Bruno"" is suffering from sloppy storytelling. ""Let's have Bruno do this..."" Actually, I get the sense the filmmakers came up with a number of situations first, found the real people this fictional character would interact with and then pieced them together using a thin, poorly constructed story. It makes no sense that Bruno would go to LA, start working on a television show, and when that falls apart, travel cross country looking to interview people and interact with them in their real lives.

Each of Cohen's characters seems designed to illustrate a common prejudice in America. Bruno is a very gay man and doesn't hide it from anyone; he almost seems to use ""I'm gay"" as a badge of honor when meeting new people. Cohen and David put Bruno is a number of situations designed to illicit a real reaction from people. Like Borat, Bruno goes over the top, on many occasions, but this only seems to make people open up more and reveal more about who they actually are. But Borat did essentially the same thing. He is racist and people revealed their racist leanings to him, believing him to be a sympathetic soul. A brilliant, and daring, concept for a film so soon after 9/11. Part of the genius of these characters is watching them react to the real people, egging them on in a way. But In ""Bruno"", a lot of this seems predictable. When Paula Abdul enters Bruno's house, for her interview, she appears uncomfortable and clueless when she has to sit on a Mexican gardener. But doesn't she always appear like this? How different is this from her real self?

Don't get me wrong. ""Bruno"" is easily the funniest film of the summer. But it isn't the groundbreaking film that ""Borat"" was. And it is disappointing that so much of it seems to be recycled.",1248825600,4,4188,4.599732262382865

It is impossible to find a movie run time (in reality, a feature run about 1hr12 min, not more), which in addition triggered questions of work context screened: prepared by media, a viewer missed surely scenes of Bruno travelling globe-for instance, dancing with British guards and his trip was narrowed with interview granted by a PA terro group leader and a sort of running for a life from the orthodox Jews of no apparent reason.

The most important is public laughing unstoppable and a good spirit afterwards.

The scenes in ""Borat"" involved plausible setups with what seemed to be real people. But virtually all of ""Bruno"" is clearly scripted. This would have been OK if the movie was still as  funny as it's predecessor. But it's, unfortunately, not even close.

The final 1/3 of the film improves somewhat. It's major theme of satirizing homophobia and ignorance was better crafted and it did elicit some laughs, at least from me. But, perhaps not suprisingly, most theater goers were laughing more at the movie's early scenes involving over the top gay sex jokes. In fact, some of these same people walked out during the movie's later ""intimate wrestling"" scene, when it became clear that this was actually a critique of homophobia rather than an example of it.

Despite all these folks not getting the joke, I stil appreciate Cohen's willingness to push the envelope. But this film failed on too many levels for me to recommend it, the worst being it's weak comedy compared to the brillance of ""Borat"".",1247875200,6,1098,4.829787234042553

It's a faux-documentary again, but this one seems more staged and scripted. The movie is roaringly funny with laugh-aloud situations, but it's also crude, coarse, off-the wall, and obscene. Was it offensive to me? No, but Cohen will do anything for a laugh, and I mean anything. No subject is off-limits to him. If you are offended by grossness, tasteless humor, sick humor, screwball comedy, going to extremes for a joke, then you are advised not to see this movie.
 It's off-the-wall comedy, bizarre stuff, nudity, dirty jokes and situations, sheer nuttiness. The movie should really have an X rating and a BT for bad taste.
 Br&uuml;no is an Austrian fashion reporter, gay, very pushy, very much in cuckoo land, who wants to be a celebrity. He is practically driven out of Austria so he goes to L.A. His admirer Lutz begs to go with him. He is always shocking people, but if you look closely at what he does, he sometimes seems to be getting under your skin and making you uneasy about your own beliefs and certainties.
 Br&uuml;no goes to several counselors with religious backgrounds who work with gays who wish to become straight. Cohen's technique is to see if the person Br&uuml;no is talking to will squirm, and to record the reactions of people who are put in uncomfortable or zany positions.
The movie has at least two consistent story lines: Br&uuml;no's quest for notoriety and the love and devotion of his helper, Lutz. Some real celebrities show up during the mayhem, Presidential candidate Ron Paul, Paula Abdul, Elton John and Sting. Watch for the human chairs in the movie with Abdul and Elton involved.
 Hilarious scenes involve rednecks. Br&uuml;no goes camping with three straight guys and decides to roam around the tents in his birthday suit early in the morning. He tries to mediate the Middle East conflict with an Israeli and a Palestinian and discusses hummus and Hamas. He buys a baby in Africa and presents him to a mainly Afro-American talk show audience who boo him. The scenes in boot camp are hysterical. The wrestling match toward the end is very weird.
Believe it or not, it's a sicko love story. If it were much longer, it would implode under its own weight.

3963994,4,B002P7UCJ0,"Sacha Baron Cohen's 'Borat' is so loved because it satirizes American culture at its worst and allows audiences in on the jokes of the outrageous main character. But why is its crudeness so hilarious? After seeing 'Bruno', in certain ways more explicit than 'Borat', I understood the appeal more. For one, Bruno's insanity makes people angry and thus unguarded. On top of that, the cringe inducing crudeness appeals to our id, our most extreme selves.

'Bruno' is essentially about a narcissistic, fame-seeking, ignorant, homosexual Austrian. He gets banned from the fashion world of his hometown, dumped by his boyfriend, and moves to L.A., a supposedly far less superficial scene. From there, he fails at pretty much everything - auditions, interviews, and even adoption. However, by his side is Bruno's ever faithful and adoring assistant's assistant - Lutz. Their relationship is a hilarious (and ultimately touching) spin on a sappy romance and is concluded in a ridiculously hilarious scene at a wrestling ring.

I actually felt more comfortable in 'Bruno' than in 'Borat' - not because of the gratuitous (and I mean gratuitous) nudity, bizarre sexual escapades, and numerous cases of disturbing sexual harassment - but because it came across as slightly less mean spirited. Perhaps this is why it received worse reviews; it seems to have revealed less about the ugly American than 'Borat'. Still, 'Bruno' covers a fair amount of ground critiquing celebrity adoption ""fads,"" token peace-promoting songs, and most of all, homophobia.

When Bruno offends an unsuspecting citizen, from Ron Paul to swingers, their reaction is often of homophobia. It is certainly understandable why most of these victims would be angry, but they often equate Bruno's insanity to his homosexuality, talking about how they don't want any ""queer *&$!."" It is reminiscent of people who hurl racial slurs only if they become furious at someone of another race, though race has absolutely nothing to do with the offense.

On top of that, 'Bruno' proves that heterosexual culture can be as scary as and more aggressive than the perceived homosexual culture. 'Bruno' throws in the face the most preposterous stereotypes anyone could have about the ""homosexual lifestyle"" that so many fear, hopefully making viewers realize their own stereotypes and fears.

'Bruno' is recommended, though be prepared to cover your eyes and bust a gut laughing.",1247702400,3,2421,5.261658031088083
3963995,4,B002P7UCJ0,"There is no question that this makes ""Borat"" look like a Disney movie.  Sasha Baron Cohen and company push things about as far as they can be pushed in this movie.  Not for the easily offended, for sure, and maybe not even for the ""only somewhat easily"" offended.

There are big differences between how the Bruno character is used to push people's buttons and how the Borat character is.  Borat/""Borat"" uses a clash of cultures to poke fun and to draw out prejudices.  But on some level, the Americans who get punk'd in ""Borat"" are trying to be good hosts and educate this odd stranger on American customs and sensibilities.  What passes for a ""custom"" or ""sensibility"", as we see in the movie, varies depending on the prejudices of the host.

The title character in ""Bruno"", however, seems more interested in testing those sensibilities and pushing the matter as far as he can.  He isn't trying to trick us into revealing our hypocrisy so much as he is trying to see how much unease and awkwardness we can tolerate before lashing out defensively.

""Borat"" was funny because the joke was on us.  ""Bruno"" is more akin to forcing people into an unwitting game of sexual ""Fear Factor"".

I give Cohen credit for having the stones to put his physical safety on the line for some of the scenes (though I question the wisdom of it).

""Borat"" was outrageous and ""Bruno"" is certainly outrageous too, but for different reasons.  ""Bruno"" has its share of laughs, but they are often uneasy laughs.  The footage of the recording of Bruno's charity song at the end of the film features some high-powered cameos that actually undermine the comedy, with the possible exception of the reveal of a certain piano-playing musician's piano bench.

Does this movie serve to only reinforce the ""gay stereotype""?  Probably only for those who mistakenly feel that the over-the-top flamboyance that Bruno displays is the normal behavior for homosexual men.  It isn't, not by a longshot.  Those who are supremely homophobic would probably not be interested in seeing this movie anyway.  My suspicion is that the ones who would get the most angered by this film are the types who appear in the ""cage match"" scene in the film.  Those are the ones that I fear would fail to see the film for the theatrical event that it is and instead use it as further ammunition in their prejudicial war against people who are different from themselves.

""Borat"" was funnier because Borat was like a cross between a child and a bull in a china shop.  ""Bruno"" is considerably more outrageous but sometimes tries too hard and as a result isn't as funny.

Based on what we can and do see in the theatrical cut of ""Bruno"", I really can't imagine there being an Unrated Version for DVD that has more footage.  Well I can, but I'm trying somewhat hard not to.",1247702400,,2808,4.672097759674134

3963997,3,B002P7UCJ0,"I stole that title from an IMDB article about box office returns.

Still, it feels like the most appropriate, softest, punnish way of putting the movie experience in total.

The movie suffers horribly, I think, from the fact that it is, and will always be compared with ""Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"".  It's virtually exactly the same style, complete with the exact same tropes involving going broke, getting into a conflict with the tag-along partner/buttmonkey with which there is an extended nude/grossout scene with before the split (Borat had the naked fight and chase sequence, Bruno has the bondage-stuck-in-bed sequence).

Really, the movie simply tries too hard, to a point where we KNOW already how things are going to happen.  We can easily predict people's reactions to things, and we can pretty much laugh at them anyway, though in some cases it's forced laughter because everyone else in the theater is laughing.

It's all too obvious; you already know just what Bruno is going to do.  It's even worse in the last sequence in the MMA octagon, with Cohen as ""Straight Dave"" and still with the fake Austrian accent.  It's just completely obvious to you, because it wouldn't be a proper Sacha Baron Cohen/Larry Charles style movie if it weren't.  There's very little this genre of faux-documentary can do without wearing itself out.

It's the sort of movie you laugh at the first time around, then merely smirk at the second time.

Without comparisons to Borat and the childish ""X was so much better than X-b!"", I think this is likely (nude chase/fight with Azamat aside) one of Cohen's most daring ventures in this style of film.  I have no idea why the Jews chased him in Israel, but I imagine it was likely staged.  I'm shocked that the MPAA initially rated this NC-17, then cuts were made to make it R, and yet the theatrical release features a whole sequence, only briefly interrupted a few times, of what is supposedly Cohen's penis ""dancing"", then pointing straight at the screen, the urethra opening, and shouting ""Brno!""

It's amazing how versatile of an actor Sacha Cohen seems to be, from his movie roles (particularly the barber whose name I forgot in Sweeney Todd) to his real life self, to his three: Ali G, Borat, Brno.  I can legitimately see how they could do another documentary style movie---Cohen doesn't much change his physical appearance, but the simple attitude and temperament is enough to make Borat and Bruno seem like completely different people.

While Sacha Baron Cohen is undoubtedly the star, Gustaf Hammarsten becomes the Fonzie---the crazy breakout character.  He deserves any and all amounts of praise given to him.  Despite the seeming straightforward hetero-looking, plain and subtle performance he gives as Lutz, it works astonishingly, and he openly subjects himself to the same sorts of stunts and peril as Cohen, becoming the Butt Monkey, even one time literally (in the movie sense only).

That's about it, though.  This movie doesn't have the sort of staying power Borat had, and the sheer amount of crude gay jokes could literally make someone sick.  It should have been worth mentioning at the end of the film that Brno is as much an off-the-wall insane misrepresentative of gays as Borat was for eastern Europeans, or Ali G for whites who listen to rap.

It's only memorable due to its shock value.  Otherwise, it will constantly and always be compared to its superior predecessor, Borat.  Every review I read for the film inevitably compared it to Borat, and Borat always came out as superior.

As a postlude, it's probably worth mentioning that a fair amount of scenes from the trailer are inexplicably cut from the movie, including the scene with the black twins, Bruno and Lutz stuck in bondage apparently checking out/in of a hotel, and others.",1247529600,,3861,4.930448222565688

However, the reason it only gets 3 stars is because it's not very original, but then again that can be said about most movies today. But this one in particular- part of what was so funny about Borat was that it hadn't been done before. It was very orginal and outrageous. This one is funny too.. but Borat had already done it.

I'll also mention that the movie, for 81 minutes, felt like forever. It wasn't bad, it just really got nowhere, despite being outrageously hilarious. I left the theater not feeling like it was not particularily memorable.

In short, it was entertaining, funny, and outrageous, but not great. I'd say wait for the DVD/Blu-Ray- you'll feel more satisfied.",1247443200,,898,4.743589743589744
