2437054,5,B000BQ7J70,"I purchased this last week and have viewed the entire DVD.  It is amazing.  Simply put..the best workout video I have ever owned.  The routines are simple, yet challenging.  You will feel that you have accomplished something when your done.  Unlike most workout DVDs this one does not have complicated steps to follow, it is very straight forward.  I will throw away all of my other workout videos.  Bob makes you feel that you can accomplish anything.  I cannot wait to see the results after trying the 6 week challenge.  I would highly recommend this DVD for anyone who needs inspiration and wants to see results.",1136764800,12,615,4.726415094339623
2437055,5,B000BQ7J70,"After having watched several episodes of the show, I was really excited to get the exercise DVD.  And I was not disappointed!  Like other reviewers have said, the fact that there are several segments that you can custom-select is a great feature of this DVD.  Some days when I have the energy, I will choose to do both the low and high intensity at once, other days when I am tired I will just do one or the other or a body sculpting segment.  Although I am a huge fan of the show, you don't have to even know about the show to enjoy this DVD.  My parents (who have never seen the show) asked me to get them a copy when they saw me exercising to it-- and they are always cautious to buy anything!  So it's great for the beginner as well as someone more advanced.

I don't want to repeat others as far as the content goes, but one thing I really like that others haven't mentioned is the 2 feel-good 'inspirational stories' at the end-- Matt and Suzy's (two contestants).  There are 10 minute clips of both of them showing how they started their weight loss journey, and how they continued to succeed. It shows them in the beginning, and then 60-80 pounds later. I thought that was great, and I watch those clips when I feel unmotivated to workout.

Also, another reviewer mentioned that there was a nutritional segment-- maybe it was just me, but I didn't see any nutritional segment on the DVD.  There were 2 exercise tips given, though.  All in all, and excellent buy-- worth more than 3 times the price.",1136678400,10,1506,4.362007168458781
2437056,5,B000BQ7J70,"I am a huge fan of this workout.  It's fun and it kicks your butt.  I think one of the reasons it is so good is because you see real people doing this workout who are struggling as much as you are and want to quit as much as you do, but BOB Harper talks to you the whole time and pushes you to keep going.  It's not one of those videos where everyone has the perfect body and can do the workout with no problems.  You see Matt and Andrea and the others from the Biggest Loser working hard and pushing themselves to complete the workout just like you are doing at home.  You need a set of dumb bells for one of the workouts, I would suggest starting off with a small weight.  If you do the workout and stick through the whole thing, you'll feel it afterwards.  It has a plan where you can do the 6 week workout or customize your own.  I hope this helps anyone out there.  Good luck and Keep going!",1136505600,16,896,3.9887640449438204
2437057,5,B000BQ7J70,"Real people doing a real workout...I really enjoyed this season of the Biggest Loser and it was a pleasure to watch and follow along/exercise with the people in this DVD.  Sure, they didn't do each exercise perfectly or at the exact tempo (they're not robots afterall) but it's a lot of fun.

The exercises are manageable, that is, you can choose the intensity of the workouts and not feel like you're not ""doing it right."" You can pick and choose/program the type of workout you want to do: 1. Warm-up (5 minutes) 2.  Low-intensity cardio (25 minutes) 3. High-intensity cardio (20 minutes)  4. Strength and sculpt (20 minutes) 5. Boot camp (20 minutes) and 6. Cool down (20 minutes). I felt very motivated to continue to exercise with this DVD unlike some other exercise videos.",1136419200,34,779,4.7481481481481485
2437058,5,B000BQ7J70,"I read some of the other reviews before writing this myself.  I think this workout is wonderful.  Yes there are jumping jacks in it but Andrea does the modification and I can follow it.  Yes it is intensive for beginners, but it is trying (somewhat) to simulate the show.  They work hard from day one!!!!!  i have managed to get through the workout's #1 and #3 for the beginners and I'm sweating at the end and burning at the end of the sculpting one, but I AM doing them.  I watched the show all season and I feel I almost know the cast, and yes sometimes they are off sync, but THAT gave me encouragement that they weren't perfect.  I don't like the video's with Barbie working out, I'm REAL and I love seeing REAL people working out.  It just doesn't get better than this DVD for me.  I am sooooooooooo looking forward to the sequel, to keep going!!!!  Keep up the great work Bob!!!",1136332800,43,885,4.3090909090909095
2437059,4,B000BQ7J70,"While I love the customization features of the DVD workout (the user can select which of the 6 workouts to complete) and also the suggested workout schedule for those new to working out who need a set regimen, I was surprised to see that the ""low intensity"" workout which is suggested for ""beginners"" is extremely high impact (lots of jumping jacks), although modifications are shown briefly. The personalities of the group are fun to watch while exercising, although it would have been nice if either Bob or one of the others would have been able to be consistent with the exercises the entire time (some of them stop momentarily or lose the routine briefly) it is difficult to follow in sections because of this. The aspects I really like are the fact that the workouts are very vigorous and that I'm able to pick and choose the sections I'd like to complete in my workout session.",1136246400,32,883,4.666666666666667
2437060,4,B000BQ7J70,"I just got this DVD, and I really like how I can customize my workouts.  It definitely gets you sweating. I have tried other videos, and those do not get my heart rate/sweat going.  The one thing that bugs me is that the music isn't very loud, and it seems like Bob and the gang are out of tempo. you do go at your own pace, so it really isn't a big deal. So, that is why I gave it a 4. (I would give it 4.5 if I could) I haven't tried the other workout rountines yet. I have only done the low intensity and I'm scared to do the high intensity! This is sure to get you into shape. No wonder those people on the show lost so much weight!",1135555200,25,636,3.8106060606060606
2437061,5,B000BQ7J70,"I bought this mostly because I thoroughly enjoyed the show and definately preferred Bob's training style over Jillian's.  I consider myself intermediate/advanced when I purchase workouts.  After doing this workout the day I received - - I can definately see why the participants lose weight in the show.  This is an EXCELLENT workout and it made me SWEAT.  I programmed 60 minutes of workout my first time out and this definately will burn calories and get your heart pumping.  The fact you can program what you wish to do is a wonderful feature that you don't receive with workouts costing twice this price.  For this price you definately can't go wrong.  This is definately a ""keeper"" workout in my workout regimen.",1135296000,231,717,4.87603305785124
2437062,5,B000BQ7J70,"I purchased this DVD on 12/20/05 in a local store.  When I got home I looked to Amazon.com for a review and realized that I bought it on the first available date.  I wanted to see how it was before I opened the package. In my opinion there is nothing worse than spending money on a workout DVD and then never using it because it sucks. Based on the other review of the product I decided to use it today.

Now, I like the Biggest Loser but the show would depress me sometimes.  I was wary about the DVD but thought that it would be a great option for someone like me. Due to massive changes in my life and schedule I've gained 20lbs this year. I recently decided that I could not continue sitting on my ass. I wanted a good workout DVD to use in the cold winter months (and get me through the holiday season).

I put the DVD in my player today and was pleasantly surprised by the content.  I like the 6 week workout plan and the different options that are available. What I like most was that the cast participants are ""real"" during the workouts.  They do not act like ""workout robots"".  They struggle, laugh, groan, and sweat. I actually laughed along with them. I love how Matt messes up- I think that would make alot of men more comfortable with doing it.

Bob is really down to earth, too.  He is motivating but sometimes I wish he would do more of the workout than ""train"" me. I glanced at the high impact workout and noticed that Bob barely did the moves.  I guess that is probably better because I need someone to motivate me more than show me the moves. He stresses that it is more important to keep moving than to be perfect or hurt yourself.

I really look forward to doing this workout again.  I want to do the Boot Camp part next week when it comes up on the plan.  I also can't wait to see how I feel and look at the end of the 6 week plan.  I definitely needed a DVD that gives me options and is realistic. I hope this DVD helps to keep me motivated and allows me to have fun while getting in shape.",1135123200,68,2012,4.123076923076923
2437063,4,B000BQ7J70,"This DVD has 5 different programs. You get 2 cardio segments 20 minutes a piece, a weights segment also 20 minutes, a bootcamp segment also 20 minutes, and a stretch segment which is only 10 minutes. The workouts are actually pretty challenging. The quality of the workouts are good, but there are a couple of reasons why I give this 4 stars instead of 5. This is very high impact. If you have joint problems this is not the DVD for you. There is ALOT of jumping. Also, this must have been recorded before the finale because the cast of former contestants were visibly unable to keep up on some of the exercises. Also, sometimes they would be going at a different pace, or be on a different foot, than Bob the trainer. These things can be pretty distracting. The versatility of this DVD is a big selling point. You can choose just one segment, or you can mix & match. Its really very user friendly. So, for the intensity of the workouts & the versatility of this DVD I give it 4 stars.",1133395200,622,985,4.358695652173913

2437065,4,B000BQ7J70,"I have several of these BL DVDs and this is the oldest but my favorite.  I like the balance of cardio and weights.  Also I think the form of the participants is better than some of the others.  None of these videos offer good enough cues or explanation of the exercise, but they are OK.  Like the others, you can do these in your living room with little equipment.  (I've lost 46lbs so far)",1459641600,2,390,4.216216216216216

2437067,5,B000BQ7J70,"My best friend of 30 years recommended this DVD to me. I had become so overweight and out of shape that I couldn't even walk around the block without getting out of breath. I got this DVD in the mail and popped it open and did part of the first routine right away. Though I didn't finish it, I did get through 10 minutes my first go. I have had the DVD about a month now and I love the simplicity of the workouts. Not only are they doable, they even have at least one of the actual contestants from the show doing a modified version of the workout so anyone can follow along. I have used the modified workouts a few times and do still feel that I got a good workout. If you have a lot of weight to lose, or if you are really out of shape, this DVD is the best place to start.

I found the exercises to be okay, not that challenging, maybe just one step above easy. However, it was the talking between the cast members and the coach that drove me crazy! The cast was off sync and sometimes even doing the wrong exercises, I found it hard to follow. I just couldn't do it anymore, I had to give it away.",1449187200,2,430,4.130952380952381

When I first got it I just viewed it to see if I thought I would like it and, initially, felt the moves were pretty wimpy.  After actually doing the workout I realized how wrong I was.  I sometimes get a little annoyed with workout videos that rapidly change from one move to the next--I spend more time trying to keep up with the rapid changes than I do actually getting a workout.

2437093,3,B000BQ7J70,"I have several Biggest Loser DVDs in my workout rotation, and this one is by far my least favorite. Here's why:

The running commentary by one of the BL contestants really ruins this workout for me. I think the woman means her comments to be playful, but she comes across as negative, snarky and rude. You know how sometimes there's that ONE person in a gym class that groans a lot, complains, and talks back & makes comments to or about the instructor? You know how irritating and distracting that is? Well, this workout has one of those. I wish there was a way to turn just her voice off, but unfortunately if you want Bob's instruction you have to listen to her too.

As others have mentioned, parts of this workout are high impact and extremely hard on the knees. I do not do the ""High Intensity"" segment at all, and I modify parts of the Bootcamp to avoid jumping. That said, I get a very good overall sculpt workout by doing the Low Intensity + Sculpting OR Low Intensity + Bootcamp.

It's boring. Bob focuses on long stretches of doing the same movement over & over again. That's great for getting a good burn, but terrible for keeping me motivated and engaged. There's just nothing fun about this workout. It gets the job done, and I'm drenched in sweat by the time I'm through, but mentally I'm like ""meh"" in regards to actually enjoying or wanting to do it.

The positives to this workout are:

Bob spends a fair amount of time giving instructions on proper form - much better than other BL workouts. Bob also does a fairly good job of keeping things even on both sides.

The Low Intensity really should just be called ""Low Impact"" because even though it starts out slow it does have me sweating by the end. I use it as a short cardio routine to really warm me up before doing any sculpting.

This workout can grow with you as your fitness increases. Beginners can start with the Low Intensity and modified moves, but more advanced exercisers can stack the workouts and/or increase the weights & intensity of the moves. This one still makes the rotation for me, and is still just as effective, even though I'm no longer a beginner.

The Cool Down is EXCELLENT. A full 20 minutes of stretching that is NOT yoga-based, as most of the other BL workouts are. Just plain, simple stretches rather than complicated yoga poses.

Overall it still makes my rotation because it's effective, but definitely not my favorite.",1409702400,2,2421,4.534403669724771

2437110,4,B000BQ7J70,"first off I picked this video up at the used movie store near my home..for $3  and for that amount, you CAN'T BEAT IT!  I am 41 in better than average shape and am on a mission to lose 10 pounds.  I do yoga/pilates/bike/run/power walk/hula hoop, soccer and tennis for activity at LEAST 3-5 times a week.  I lost 6 pounds in 2 weeks with this video alone and really CLEAN eating.  I feel GREAT!

About the video:

Pros:  I liked that it was EASY TO FOLLOW and kept my attention fairly well (but I could attribute this to the fact that I REALLY want to lose 10 more pounds so I'm focusing and TRYING REALLY HARD!)  as in life...things are only as 'fun' or 'interesting' as you make it!  ;)  I was able to turn the volume completely down after doing each routine twice each and turn my iPod on and use my own music..which helps.  I DID break a sweat.  I DID see results (and still am)  I will say that by the 2nd go round of the light cardio, I held my 3 pound hand weights for extra 'umpf'  Bottom line, if you are just starting out or want something to throw in rotation this is a good one..especially if you can find it for under $5. totally worth it.

Cons:  The only REAL complaint that I have is more of a 'rant'.  OK. I never watched the show..I don't watch tv so I  had no idea what it was about nor the characters, nor do I care to.  BUT I feel that the two guys in the 1st cardio workout that you do on weeks 1 and 3 ....can REALLY ruin my workout if I watch them too much or if I'm in a premenstrual mode.  The heavy set guy is SO UNINSPIRING  he looks like he is simply going through the motions, he barely lifts his chubby little stumps to break a sweat and his punches look like a 6 year old girl flailing her arms around to hit a pretend punching bag.  Maybe this is just 'me and my personality' but I am like 'if you are going to do something and put time and effort into it' then PUT EFFORT INTO IT! why just go through the motions?  DO IT. give it YOUR ALL!  He is a REAL workout buzzkill!!!  I can tell he isn't trying because he does not sweat or breath heavy and the two CHICKS do!!  look dude...NO WONDER YOU'RE FAT!

The other guy, who apparently lost a ton of weight...I admire his drive..but in the video he seems like he is more focused on 'oooh look at me and how fast I can do the moves' and not at all worried about his form!  His punches are thrown side to side SO QUICK when that is not even what Bob is doing up in front..he is throwing front punches.  Then his squats...oh my.  His legs are so far out and the form is HORRIBLE..but he is going so fast...when all he is really doing is sacrificing form.

In closing, I like the video...it gives me a good weekday workout 5 days a week without boredom (when my own music is added) but I could TOTALLY have done without the two dudes in it.  The chicks may be chubby, but at least they try and are smiling and doing the workouts with CORRECT form and enthusiasm.

Bottom line:  Buy the video if you can find it for $5 or under.  Use it 5 days a week and incorporate healthy eating habits..lots of water, cut out sugary snacks and add in a few other dvd's or outside activities and YOU WILL SEE RESULTS!

Good Luck!",1372464000,,3191,4.056089743589744

Bob works on motivating them too. If you do have a lot of issues with your knees though and you buy this dvd take it easy because there are exercises like jumping jacks,jump ropes, and lunges.

The workouts are tough at times (lots of squats, holding a lunge pose) and they make you sweat.

There are a few inaccuracies on Amazon's description of the tape. (1) Jillian Michaels is not in the video, though she's listed as an actor in the tape. (2) There are FOUR workouts, not six.

If you can walk to your car without getting winded or pulling a hamstring, I strongly recommend P90X. It's quite challenging and filled with variety. There's a different workout for each night.

2437147,4,B000BQ7J70,"This is the first in a relatively long line of Biggest Loser workout DVDs, and it's also one of the better ones. It contains four workouts, all of which can be completed within half an hour, as well as a short warm-up segment, and a (too long!) ten-minute stretch / cooldown segment. The DVD encourages you to go through a six-week training program that has you alternating which of the four main programs you do each day, but you can also customize all 6 pieces to create your own ideal workout, depending on your fitness level.

Each workout presents its own challenges - as someone who is pretty fit and has been keeping up a regular workout program for over a year, I still find myself winded or giving up here and there. This is partially because Bob, your trainer, loves to d-r-a-w things out, right when you're hitting your threshold for pain and / or exhaustion. Regardless, all four workouts keep you engaged and for the most part, the time flies by.

As for those aforementioned challenges? The low impact cardio is five minutes longer than the others, to make up for its slightly easier pace. The sculpt workout is the most traditional weight training program, with a ridiculous series of abs moves right at the end to really knock you out. The high impact cardio really does in your calves through the endless tire runs and high knees. And the Boot Camp, a cardio with weights circuit training program, is pretty intense on the arms and knees. ALL of these workouts will make you feel like you've really worked, without having to spend hours dialing it in at the gym, which is great. The contestants have much better form and more personality than those you'll see on future BL DVDs, but it's still comforting to see them struggle and pause here and there when things get really intense.

Some words to the wise - if you're really out of shape or are just starting to workout again, take it easy. Don't be ashamed to start out on the beginner moves or use light weights (or no weights at all). Just because this is the first ever BL DVD, it's definitely not easier than any of the others. I find the moves a little less creative and a little more strenuous on the joints than other DVDs, but in general I'd easily recommend this as a part of a regular workout program.",1275436800,8,2280,4.5157384987893465

2437151,4,B000BQ7J70,"Now, I have been a fan of the show `The Biggest Loser' since its first season, and even if I've missed a few seasons in between, this past season re-sparked my adoration of just what this show represents.  Now, I am far from obese, but I could use a little toning.  My wife, who is like a total workout junkie, grabbed this DVD from our local library and after one week we decided to purchase our own copy.

I am not one to get into workout videos.  I find them rather corny and ineffective.  I don't generally like the pacing and I find the workouts to be sub par compared to what I could do on my own (when I actually decide to do anything).

Bob gets this one right.

I think that, while flawed, the flaws are what make this workout work for me.  The contestants from the show (from the first two seasons) are all heavily inspired by Bob (who wouldn't be) and it shows in their glowing participation.  Even when they stumble around, nearly fall, lose their pace or even begin to throw in the towel they are endearing and likable `instructors'.  Bob is a GREAT instructor.  He has a very personable quality that makes him shine and keeps us interested.  He has a nice connection with the contestants and that translates through the screen and into our living rooms.

The workouts are basic yet very engaging and involved and so you really FEEL it.  Like I said, I am FAR FROM OBESE (I'm barely overweight) but I nearly threw up the first time I did the low intensity cardio (lunges are my weakness, and holding that last squat is ridiculous).  Bob keeps you moving no matter what, and that keeps your heart elevated and your mind focused and so you really get the most out of these workouts.

I find Gary a tad annoying, Drea as well.  They're comments back and forth can be a little distracting to be honest, but it's something that is easily overlooked.

I do wish that there were more workouts here, but that is what the other DVD's are for.  This workout is not really for the advanced student, it is to encourage those who feel that they can't do anything to realize that they can do a lot more than they ever imagined.  I admire Bob for taking a very forgiving and encouraging approach to this DVD.  The fact that he shows alternate ways for you at home to engage in the workouts without overexerting yourself is admirable and makes this DVD something that everyone can enjoy and participate in.

I'll be picking up more of these DVD's very soon!",1261526400,3,2454,4.406666666666666

Bob's style is tough, but he provides plenty of motivation through the tough spots. He has a lot of reps, so pace yourself. Don't use heavy weights until you've gotten familiar with the workout. There's lots of jumping for the cardio. He does give modifications for those.

The only complaint I have for this particular one(The reason I don't use this one as often) is that one of the contestants, Drae, is always making stupid comments during the workout. And if you can get passed that, she is always cheating during the workout and complaining, using bad form etc. Bob's always coming to pick on her, and rightly so. The other contestants appear to struggle during the tough spots, but you don't hear them whining or cheating. Totally annoying.

May not be suitable for people who are looking for high-impact. If you can already do tae-bo or workout all the time, it may be too easy - but it is still great. It is just right for me. it's the first exercise dvd i can actually complete! Other reviewers were correct when they stated there is a lot of jumping. I am surprised about the amount of jumping and lunging - but if you cant do that, they tell you to just tone it down and do it without the jumps. Overall i would give it the 5 stars!

Also, there is extra care given to stretching before and after workouts. Sadly, this isn't often found in workout DVDs and is a blessing when you find a workout that has great warmups and cooldowns.

I'm a big fan of BL, and I have the Power Scult & Cardio Max dvds, which I love, so I figured this one would be just as good.  It's a little boring.  There's really no music, the warm up is done with each contestant doing a separate move, and some of the contestants are annoying.  Drea is the worst.  She doesn't shut up, and she doesn't do the exercises the way they're supposed to be done.  She takes the easy way out.  She constantly makes rude comments to Bob.  Maybe she's trying to make everyone think that she has such a close relationship with Bob.  It's extremely disrespectful and annoying.  I find myself, yelling at the t.v., ""shut up you moron,"" so this workout is not helping relieve my stress.  I can't stand that woman. The most inappropriate comments are the ones when she asks Bob in different ways what he's been smoking.  I can't believe they don't stop filming and tell her to be quiet.  I don't understand why they would film that and allow her to keep talking.  It's so irritating.  I can't even look at her without wanting to slap her.  I'm so glad I wasn't watching BL when she was on.  I don't think I could've made it through 2 hours every week.  Needless to say this dvd will be going back to the library.  I cannot stand another minute of her.  Also, the workouts are too repetitive. I get bored with them.  And, it's a little hard on the knees.  Too much jumping.  I'd rather keep doing my power sculpt & cardio max. I love those.",1254096000,4,1587,4.265993265993266

Nothing annoys me more than DVDs where impossibly perky people aerobicizing behind the instructor whoop it up like they're having the time of their lives.",1250035200,,477,5.142857142857143

I have one slightly bad knee, and although I can make it through most dance workout dvds easily (simmons, etc) this was too high impact.  Also, the music is really whatever in this, a background afterthought.  This makes it quite boring for me, as I prefer when music is either featured or the steps are to the music.  Doing jumping jacks to blah music just does not inspire me to exercise!  In the end I was glad I rented this because, it was too tedious for me to want to repeat.",1247788800,,575,4.238532110091743

This workout was EXCELLENT. I can keep up, and if some of the workouts are too hard on my body in the moment, then I can step it down a notch with Bob's recommendations.  It's easy to follow, and easy to memorize, so you can do yourself, at your own speed, without the video later on.

Bob's relaxed spirit makes it seem like he is working out with you in your livingroom. Included warm ups and cool downs, and everything from low-impact to strength and sculpt.

The plan is to keep moving, even if it's just from side to side.  It's definitely a good work out for beginners, like myself.  I feel the burn each time!",1240272000,,743,4.271428571428571
2437168,3,B000BQ7J70,"I'm not overweight nor do I have any major health problems.  But this video was VERY challenging in good ways and bad:

Good:
-you can customize your workout
-you will DEFINITELY work up a sweat

Bad:
-it is hard to ""keep up"" because the participants are constantly changing the rhythm of the routine
-on that same note, the fact that the participants are having a hard time keeping up is a distraction.
-the guy is pretty annoying.  there were times where I wished he would just go away.
-it was REALLY hard on my knees (i haven't had knee issues since running track in high school and even then they didn't have this much stress on them).

Overall, I'm not sure if I'd purchase this again given the opportunity.  But now that I have it, I'll make the best of it.",1238544000,,764,4.382978723404255

However, I have a damaged Achilles tendon and at my weight (I have 100 lbs to lose), the extended series of deep lunges followed by squats, by more lunges are just impossible and painful for me. But, when I am about 1/2 way to my goal, I suspect I will return to this one. While the participants are often out of synch with the trainer, I found that nice... real... not a bunch of perfect robotic followers.",1238025600,,564,4.136363636363637
2437170,4,B000BQ7J70,"I purchased this video because I love the Power Sculpt and Cardio Max DVDs.  I have only done the Boot Camp, High-Intensity Cardio, the Sculpt, and the Stretch workouts (being an intermediate/advanced exerciser, I bypassed the Low-Intensity Cardio segment because they said it was for people who have never worked out before).  I must say, overall, I am impressed with this series of workouts.  I love the ""mix and match"" option, so you can construct a workout that is designed for you.  The Boot Camp is a nice addition for those mornings when I don't have time to do a full cardio and strength workout.

The High-Intensity Cardio is very good--it is a bit repetitive, but Bob really gets your heart rate up, especially during the tires and football runs.  He works the lower body first, does upper body, and then goes back to the lower body with some kicks.  I like it because the moves are not complicated and can be done easily, but very effective at getting your heart rate up and moving.  No, the contestants in the background don't always keep together, but I try to ramp up my own intensity, and end up being out of rhythm with them anyway.  I tend to go faster than the people on the DVD, to really push my heart rate to its limit.  Let me tell you, I was drenched in sweat after those 20 minutes!

The Sculpt/Strength workout is good as well; it is a basic strength workout without any combo moves that work both upper and lower body together.  Bob focuses on upper and lower body separately, but I really like his core moves towards the end with the reverse crunches, regular crunches, oblique crunches, and ab holds.  I have a tendency to like the old school moves, so I didn't really mind the absence of the combination moves.  However, I do other workouts during the week that have those, such as a plethora of Jillian Michaels workouts and some of the Women's Health workouts, to balance out my weekly rotation. Just because one workout you do doesn't have some of the moves you want doesn't mean the DVD is worthless.  Also, I have read some complaints about the music; music is never (and shouldn't be, in my opinion) a factor in my decision regarding whether or not a workout is worth buying--if you're focusing on the WORKOUT, you shouldn't even notice the music!

Overall, this DVD is worth investing your money in.  All of the Biggest Loser workouts have a solid foundation, and this one is no different.  It will make you sweat and help you sculpt at the same time, and will help you get the results you're looking for as long as you put the appropriate effort into it and see it for what it's worth--a very well-put-together ""back to basics"" workout.",1237766400,9,2673,4.556485355648536

I alternate these and workout six times a week. Now, I'm no skinny minnie, in fact, I have about 100 pounds that I would like to lose. But I wanted to expand my B.L. library and bought this video, Biggest Loser Workout 1, and was really disappointed.  This workout was boring and repetitious. I didn't sweat ANYWHERE near the previous two. I couldn't believe that this workout was from the same people.

I know The Biggest Loser is a terribly unhealthy way to lose weight that intensely/quickly, but this is a great DVD for a normal person. The routines are varied and change quickly. You get a good mix of cardio and strength. My legs and arms are usually pretty sore after doing. The setup at the start is a little annoying, you have to individually select which workouts you want to do that day, so it takes some time away from working out.

I'm kind of new to the high intensity cardio moves in this dvd. I've been doing Pilates (Denise Austin & 10 minute Solutions), walking (Leslie Sansone videos), and rollerblading for the last several years. I have always maintained a beautiful figure with Pilates. I'm 27 and just had my second child about 2 months ago. After my 1st child, the weight melted off of me in no time at all with just walking. 6 years later, I popped in my Pilates dvds with doctor's ok to resume exercising but just didn't see the results as I did before. I borrowed this DVD from a friend and started with the boot camp segment. I was NOT prepared for ALL THE JUMPING! I must say, though, after the initial shock and realization that I had a long way to go, I came to look forward to my progress: if I could keep up with the jumping, I knew I was moving in the right direction.
I'm not fat by any stretch- 5'4"" & 128 lbs (formerly 132 prior to starting the Biggest Loser regime) I got rid of about 4 lbs in 2 weeks - Not bad. I'm still working out every day with it. I feel MUCH STRONGER. The first to shape up were my buns & thighs, which was very motivating. I can button my pre-pregnancy size 2 jeans.
The benefits of this workout for me are that I feel stronger, and I have more energy- a big plus for a mom of 2. I am getting toned in no time at all. I am now on par with the subculture of people who are maintaining physical fitness, and it feels great!
I enjoy the customizing aspect: warm up, high intensity cardio, sculpting, & cool down.
My other favorite combo is warm up, bootcamp, cool down.
The workouts are very challenging to me. I am not a ""sweater"" even while rollerblading on the hottest of New Orleans summer days, so I know that when I have sweat rolling down my face I am busting my butt. I've never seen the show and had just heard of this in passing. Now I am going to buy my own dvd!
BONUS: There is an intro to trainer & cast segment that I watch occasionally for motivation. I just love to hear the stories of the others and to see their before and after. I love the real people on the videos huffin' & puffin.' Bob is also very encouraging.",1232064000,2,2320,4.146341463414634

He is also not annoying to listen to (although if you think he is, you can select ""music only"" which is a nice touch).

I have also been watching my portion sizes obviously but I was into working out previously but had not been able to work out much for the last three years during my two nearly back to back pregnancies due to my history of miscarriage (I was limited to only light walking)so I packed on unnecessary pounds and was more than happy to get rid of them.  I started slow and worked up, initially doing this DVD as my primary one because of the first segment which is low impact aerobics since I had a knee injury requiring 6 weeks of physical therapy after my last child was born. I like that this DVD shows you how to modify certain exercises to help your knees and you still feel like you get a workout.  For anyone complaining they don't 'get enough' with this workout after doing the recommended 6 week program (which I followed) I have now worked up to being able to do this entire DVD without stopping (100 minutes total) and by the time you get to the last aerobic segment (Bootcamp) you will feel tired but envigorated that you did it!  I use 6 lbs weights when I do the Strength and sculpt section and the Bootcamp but if I do the entire DVD I only do a 2 lb weight for the Boot camp section due to muscle fatigue and still get an awesome workout.

Bob Harper is a natural and it is great to see the actual participants from the show in the workout DVD. What an inspiration they are.",1208822400,,393,4.077922077922078
2437197,4,B000BQ7J70,I bought this so I could hopefully finally get rid of the fat that's big plaguing me forever. I liked Cardio Max and the Sculpting one so I figured this would be better. Not so much. I just don't like Jillian and her workout is just not a level 3. Bob is always the toughest and he's not condenscending to the contestants. I like the yoga session at the end but on the box it says it's 20 minutes but it's only 10. If you are going to get any videos in this series get the cardio and sculpting videos.,1208736000,,501,4.02

I'm not completely out of shape, walk 1 mile everday/5 days a week - and I still worked up a good sweat on the low impact. I'm wondering though...most of the reviews I read are from people who have just started - is here anyone who has been on it longer than a month and noticed any changes in your body? I realize a healthy diet goes along with it but, I was wondering if anyone has seen their body change.
I love it so far - and have recommended it to all of my friends.",1207094400,,564,3.9130434782608696

The ONLY thing that gets on my nerves is after doing this dvd for several weeks, the comments, grunts, etc... made by the cast to get a lil old, but you can always turn that part off and just have music :)
Overall tho, this is a GREAT workout!!",1206921600,,374,4.0675675675675675
2437200,5,B000BQ7J70,"First let me say that I really enjoyed watching the first three seasons of the Biggest Loser.  (not so much the last two)  I really like this DVD.  I think it is a good starter.  The videos are just the right amount of length for a begineer or in my case someone who is re-starting.  Being able to alternate is great because you do not get bored.  Sometimes the cast does get out of step but to me it makes it feel more like an actual class.  Some of the moves would be tough on knees because of the jumping but modifications are shown.

Bob seems to know when you might be ready to quit.  My mom was ready to give up and about that time Bob said don't quit don't turn us off and she kept going.  I also like the positive encouragement.  You can tell it is tough for some of the cast members so you do not feel so bad if it is tough for you.",1205366400,,841,3.9171597633136095

The workout is great and the people are real people struggling with weight.  When your legs are burning so are theirs and they actually show it!!  They don't paint on a fake smile like the work out is not affecting them in the least and the people are not already stick thin, they have bodies like the average person using the video.  So I would highly recommend this video you can really realate to it and it is like working out with your friends!!  It is just plain FUN!!",1204675200,,611,4.260869565217392
2437204,5,B000BQ7J70,"I was a little skeptical about this workout at first. After looking for something that is easy to follow and do-able, it seemed the search might be fruitless. This workout, however, could not be more satisfying.

Bob is a bad boy, but flirty and cute in his narration. It's a sexy video, with his teasing and commands, which takes my mind off the pain of the workout. It makes me laugh, even when in positions that burrrrrrrnnnnnn.

The participants are all regular people. They mess up, they sweat, they grimace, they grunt, and they talk back and forth, exclaiming out loud that they are in pain from the burn, and that the workout is hard for them. (And Bob laughs and then does something to make it harder, like pressing lightly on their shoulders while they are in a long-held squat.) The participants even lose step / count at times - it's GREAT!

Make sure to watch other things than the videos so you can see the before and after videos of the participants. Some of the Biggest Losers are very tight and in-shape now and others still have a way to go, which makes it more encouraging and easier to work out with than traditional exercise videos.

All of the exercises (in the week one workout at least) are totally doable for me. I have bad knees but know my limits - I just didn't go as deep into squats or lunges, and there are all sorts of other exercises for which I can do the full range of motion. It's a tough workout but as long as you're mindful of yourself and know what you can and can't do, this video would make an excellent companion (or replacement!) for what you have now. You can work as hard and as deep or as soft and as light as you want to.

There are all sorts of options to use on this disc - narration and music, just music, and six different workouts. It's a versatile product, very pleasant to watch, and it makes me feel like I've accomplished something after I'm finished doing it.",1204156800,2,1917,4.373595505617978

2437206,4,B000BQ7J70,"I'm a fairly active, 5 months postpartum mom, trying to lose 10 lbs of baby weight.  My favorite part of this video is the variety of workouts and the flexibility to program your own depending on how you feel.  Each of the 4 workouts (minus the warm-up and cool-down sections) is only 20 minutes, which is nice for me because I never have huge chunks of time.  My heart rate gets up and stays up the entire time.  That low-impact workout has more lunges and squats than I've ever done, I can't imagine a true beginner completing that section at first.  I enjoy having real people doing the exercises instead of perfect models, even if it means they get off beat and are hard to follow sometimes.  I also like that you have a music only option. However, that brings me to my biggest con of this video....the music is terrible.  It is completely repetitive and is just the theme music from the show.  The workouts don't move in sync with the music and it can be challenging to keep a rhythm.  That being said, Bob is a good motivater and trainer, the workouts are great exercise, and I enjoy doing them despite the music.  For the price, this one is a definite keeper.",1203292800,,1166,4.406542056074766

I also like that Bob gives you a few different ways to do the exercises depending on your skill or fitness level.  (Sometimes the method I use depends on how exhausted I am!)

I find it a little hard to stay with the music, because it's hard to hear the music over Bob talking.  I think there's an option to use music only, though.  I would caution, however, to think twice about buying this if you have knee problems.  Bob includes LOTS of lunges and some squats and I am having some knee pain.  Maybe my form is just wrong, I'm not sure.  I am happy with my purchase, though.  It's a good way to get your cardio in on a cold winter day when you can't get outdoors to exercise.

I love that there are real people doing the workouts and not these gorgeous super-humans on other DVD's who seem like robots.  The contestants struggle, joke around and talk during the workouts, which encourages me to keep going.

The only problem I have with this DVD is the amount of time it takes!  With the six week program, one session can take almost an hour because of the warm up and cool down sessions.  Sometimes I just do not feel like I have an hour to devote to exercising, so I get discouraged for that day and end up not doing any physical activity.  I think you can get a great workout in 10 or 15 minutes, and sometimes that's all I can do!  If you are one of those people, this DVD probably isn't for you.

I love the bootcamp, also!

Contrary to what all of the other frequent workout-ers have said, myself being one of them, I do NOT agree that if you workout regularly that you will find this DVD a letdown.

I don't usually enjoy warm ups and cool downs, but for some reason I really like these ones.  The four workouts are really great and really work. I am alternating this with  a latin dance workout and the NYC Ballet workout. The combination of all these is giving good coverage on everything without getting bored.

I choose the high intensity cardio along with either the strength & sculpt or the boot camp.  This gives me 40 minutes of what the experts recommend that we as humans should be taking on in our daily schedules for a healthy heart, body and mind.

The first time I did the DVD I was pleasantly surprised at working up a good sweat and staying interested.  I like how they use real people in the video and I generally like Bob's teaching style.  I also like that you can opt out of the trainer audio if you would like too.

Another nice feature is the customized workout where you can choose any or all segments to mix and match as you like.  It's a little help in the fight against boredom which is common with workout DVDs in general.

I do have a couple of minor complaints about the DVD which lead to a 4 instead of 5 star rating.

As I said before I really like that they use real people but it's distracting and non-motivating when the participants bail out of a certain exercise because they can't hold it.  It doesn't help my resolve.

Another major pet peeve of mine is the fake counting where the trainer counts down and then just before the last count says something to draw out  the misery that much longer.  It only happens a couple of times on this DVD but it's kind of annoying.  That's a good reason to use the 'music only' option.

In all I would say this is a very good DVD to add to your workout collection.",1200528000,,1303,4.22672064777328

I've done many workout dvds, and this falls short of some of the other workouts out there. The warm up is choppy with no real flow, and the low intensity aerobics is a hodge podge and not a whole lot of fun.
I have recently started doing Kundalini Yoga (Fat Free Yoga with Ana & Ravi along with Soul Sweat with Chantal and Dance the Chakras Yoga workout with Ana & Ravi) I recommend you also add some Kundalini Yoga for its effects on the metabolism and it feels like less hard work as well.

It has real people working out. They get tired the same time you would, so it is a *Realistic* workout DVD. You will know what I mean when you buy this one. I am on my way to order the second volume!

While I did sweat and found certain parts to be challenging, I was not that impressed.  I thought that there was too much repetition of the same movements....I don't want to do a ""step touch"" move for 5 minutes.  Plus, at the end of the low-intensity cardio, they do lunges and squats for an eternity.  I consider myself to be in pretty good shape and I couldn't even finish all the lunges and squats.  In addition, it was annoying that everyone on the video was going at a different pace.  At least if Bob would have kept doing the workout, I could have just followed him, but he stops to go look around at everyone else.",1191542400,5,733,4.352941176470588

Some of them are quite overweight, and I figured that the workouts wouldn't be demanding because of that. Was I wrong! I do not know how the low intensity cardio section is, but the high intensity workout is very good. It basically consists of athletic drills such as football runs, tire drills, kickboxing, and punches. The trainer, Bob Harper, is demanding yet gentle. Very knowledgeable and supportive. The sculpt section is good as well. It consists of weight lifting, squats, crunches, and plank position exercises. But the bootcamp section is the most demanding section of all. It is 20 minutes of high intensity cardio interchanged with weight lifting (jumping jacks with weights, squats with weights, etc...) Very challenging. I'm in pretty good shape and I still haven't conquered this section yet. Overall, excellent DVD. I highly recommend it.",1191283200,5,992,5.167701863354037

I was sore the next day and knew I had done some real work.  I could hardly wait to do the next set.  Day 3 I was still a bit sore, but feeling good.  Bob pushes harder than I could ever do myself and WOW does he know what he's doing. I am excited every morning to work out with Bob and the crew.  When I see them struggling at the same thing I am, it's funny and pushes me on.
I just can't say enough about how much this DVD has worked for me.  I am a huge fan of the show so I really was excited to have Bob as my trainer. (and he's free!)
I love the fact that the others on the show sweat real sweat and show that they want to quit...just like me.  But, they don't and so I don't either.  It's real!!  Get it and try it.  If you really push yourself, to your own limits, like Bob urges you to do, you will feel it and you will love yourself for it.
Even my kids love to do it.  It moves are really, really easy but SOOOO effective.  Not confusing like so many aerobics, etc. DVD's I've tried.

2437265,5,B000BQ7J70,"I used to go to the gym all the time before having my first baby.  I went on the treadmills and eliptical, but I really loved the strength training classes.  Since having my baby, I have no time for the gym.  I have a few excerise tapes (Cardio Yogo, Pilates, Abs of Steel, etc.) but I've never really enjoyed them much.  I read that this DVD lets you customize your workout and has short (20-25 minute) workouts for strength training, low-intensity, high-intensity, bootcamp and then warm-up and cool-down/stretch.  I liked the idea of picking from this menu and working out for 20-25 minutes or longer, depending on how much time I had.

Well --- I love every one of these work-outs.  Especially bootcamp.  It is difficult but short.  They are interval based, so you'll do push-ups or squats or punching for a minute, and then switch.  That way, you get to work a different muscle/area when you reach your limit.  I have beeen recommending this to everyone.  Plus, I love Trainer Bob (he is so funny) and his rapport with the ""biggest loser"" team.

I like the fact that I could follow along right off the bat. The moves have modified versions incase you need them.

Bob is a nice trainer. He is very encouraging. He is always reminding you to do what you can and to hold in your abs.

That said, I found that all segments of the workout provided enough challenge (sometimes more than enough!) for me. I also liked Bob, the trainer's style. He was upbeat without being completely annoying. On the downside, since they used 'real people' to do the workouts, not everyone is doing the exercises at the same time, which sometimes threw my timing off as well. Still, it is kind of nice to see that it isn't just me who messes up at times. Gotta keep it real! I also thought the inspirational stories were a nice touch.

2437276,5,B000BQ7J70,"Let me tell you, nothing about this workout DVD is for beginners!  That being said, it is a great set of workouts.

There is a 5-minute warm up / stretch segment, which I recommend before choosing any of these workouts.

The low intensity cardio session is 25 minutes; it includes lunges, jumping jacks, squats and kickboxing with some punching and trunk rotations.  It is a great cardio workout--even my husband will do this one with me.

The high intensity cardio is more of the same, but only 20 minutes, and moves at a quicker pace.  Football drills and ""tires"", more squats and lunges and kickboxing moves.  The one thing I will say about all of these workouts is that Bob (the trainer) does a great job at explaining modifications for all the moves, so that you do truly feel that you can move at your own pace and fitness level.

The 20 minute strength and sculpt workout includes work with free weights and focuses on shoulders, chest, biceps and triceps, more squats and lunges and some heavy-duty ab work. Adjusting your intesity by increasing or decreasing the size of your weights keeps this progam challenging.

The 20 minute bootcamp is probably my least favorite segment; it's kind of weird. You can do it with or without weights, and maybe it's my fitness level, but I find that without weights, it's too easy, but with weights, it's nearly impossible.  Even my 1 and 2 lb. weights get to be too much. More intense, ""one minute drills"" that focus on all out muscle toning and cario.  Good exercise if you can swing it.

Lastly, there's a 10 minute cool down / stretch which I find very good for all major muscle groups. Let me tell you, if you pair a cardio workout with either the strength and sculpt or boot camp, you've done a lot of work. Bob keeps you moving (not to mention he cracks himself up, which is kind of amusing), and seeing how great the contestants look is really very inspiring to keep moving.

While I still have about 40 pounds to lose, I have been exercising every day since last September and have lost 55 pounds. I am getting in better shape and worried (or hoped?) that this dvd would be too easy for me.

Wrong! The first day, I did warm-up, bootcamp, and cool down. By the end, I was sweating up a storm and *felt* like I had just gotten a great workout. The next day, I tried the low-intensity cardio -- again, I was kinda surprised at how great of a workout it was!

I liked the camaraderie of the trainer and participants. I even liked Drea snapping at him not to bug her during the ""Boot Camp"" portion, because that's how I feel while working out! It is nice to see ""real"" people in an exercise dvd instead of just hard-bodied models.

It brought my heart rate up and the shorter (20 minute) cardio workouts are perfect for when I don't have time or don't want to go to the gym.  Also, it's customizable so you decide which workouts you want to do that day.  Like a lot of the other reviewers I love that the people on the video are real, normal sized, sweaty, people!  It's much nicer to see someone actually working along with you.  I think Bob the trainer is motivating and a couple times I found myself laughing/smiling because he's entertaining.

The ""music"" was terrible, what you could hear of it.  The exercisers were doing the repetitive motions at all different speeds, while the ""trainer"" Bob sometimes modeled the actions for you.  The rest of the time he harangued the other exercisers and the audience.  If you would like to have at least a little fun while working out GO ELSEWHERE!!!",1170806400,12,501,4.625

I like this video a lot. Bob is very motivating and he can get the extra effort out of me. I'm sore right now from doing the boot camp workout yesterday. The basic workout is 30 min. 5 min warm up, 20 min workout, 5 min cool down. If you want you can add extra 20 min sessions.  My favorite workout video so far.",1170720000,,434,3.9770114942528734

I have been doing this workout regularly for about 4 months along with doing Weight Watcher points.  To date (4 months & 2 weeks) I have gotten rid of 39lbs.  The workouts are challenging at 1st and as you adapt you can step them up by adding heavier weights.  I still cannot do all 4 of the workouts like the contestants.  You get 4 different workout to choose from plus the warm-up (4 minutes) & cool down (10 minutes).  The Low Impact is the longest at (25 minutes long), Toning (20 minutes), High Impact (20 minutes) & Boot Camp (20 minutes).  I enjoy working out with Bob and the contestant from The Biggest Loser.  I have gotten 3 other women that are logging there progress with me in my group to purchase this video as well.  They enjoy it.  One of the women is a PE teacher and does mega long workouts but is challenged and feels great doing this one.  I also purchased the sequel to this DVD and don't like it nearly as much as I do this one.  You WILL lose weight doing this workout along with changing your food intake.

They only last 20 minutes each, but I can see why those people lost so much weight on the show.  Example, picture doing kick-boxing for 20 minutes with a 3 pound handweight in each hand.  Of course you can start off doing the routines with no weights to build up your stamina.  Bob works you hard from the first minute to the last.  I had to stop several times to catch my breath.  But they seem to work.  I've only been doing them for a week and I feel more toned.  They really are motivating to do.  If you're looking for quick workouts that will get you toned and lose weight, this is it.  Even the 15 minute cool down has some yoga poses in it that really strengthen your muscles.",1169078400,,851,4.153374233128834

The instructor isn't annoying (in fact he's cute AND funny), and the people in the background working out with you are REAL people, so you don't feel intimidated. Best of all, I never have to leave the house which is  perfect for me with a baby at home, and I'm done in 45 minutes.  You can actually choose your workouts and if you only have 20 minutes, you can get an awesome workout in very little time.  The best $10 I ever spent.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the music is relatively quiet and doesn't add to the experience at all.  I love using my own music from my iPod to motivate me when I do this workout.",1169078400,2,807,4.134615384615385

2437302,4,B000BQ7J70,This DVD was just what I needed. I like how you can break a sweat without being confused with the moves in the work out. I also liked the feature of turning off the trainer or having the trainer in the workouts. Bob could get a little annoying.

I thought, there is no way I am going to get a good work out with 5 pound weight! Boy, was I WRONG! After I was finished, I was more sore using the 5 pound weights than the 20 I am used to lifting at the gym!

I was worried this DVD would be too easy.  It is definitely NOT too easy. I did the low impact cardio on the first day and it kicked my butt; however, unlike some other videos, I was able to do it from the start. It is terrific and motivating and I can see myself sticking to it and losing the weight I need to lose. None of the moves are too easy or too hard. Bob always shows an alternate move in case the moves are too difficult. He constantly says to work at your own pace and listen to your own body. Once I master the low impact, I can move onto the more difficult high impact. I've tried numerous videos in the past and found them so difficult (all of the ""FIRM"" videos) that I couldn't complete them. Sometimes even the alternate moves were too hard. This DVD is by far the best workout DVD I've tried.

INFO ABOUT THE 6 WEEK WORKOUT PLAN:: As for the complaints that there is supposed to be a 6 week workout plan and there isn't, those people did not notice a small misprint on the workout plan screen. It says weeks 1 - 3 (meaning 1,2,and 3), alternate workouts #1 and #3 (6 days a week).  Then it says weeks 2 - 4, alternate workouts #2 and #4. It SHOULD say weeks 4 - 6 (meaning weeks 4,5, and 6), alternate workouts #2 and #4 (again, 6 days a week).  Hope that helps!",1166054400,21,1435,4.056537102473499

My goal was to do the six week program as the dvd recommends.  The positives:  great work, lost weight, build up muscles that I didn't even know I had, my stomach is a bit flatter and I'm definetly stronger.  I also enjoyed that the contestants who were not fully in shape, they too had a hard time keeping up, and enjoyed bob's encouragement and repetitve information on why we were doing each exercise.  I ended up feeling like I truly had a personal trainer. The negatives:  it was for six weeks work out program with two alternating work outs for weeks 1-3 and then said two work outs for weeks 2-4.  What about the other two?  I'm not sure if I miss read the information or not. I kept rechecking and decided I'd do what I thought would be good for the last two weeks. The only other comment would be to have a special segment on diet and other work out advise.

You only need weights for the strength & sculpt workout, and you can choose to use them in the bootcamp workout if you want to challenge yourself. You can choose to follow a 6 week workout plan or you can customize your workout! The contestants are  actually overweight & have a hard time keeping up at times which is a great difference from other workout dvds where they are already slim & don't struggle during the workout routine. Overall a great DVD!!Will definately recommend!:)",1164067200,8,722,4.776
2437309,4,B000BQ7J70,"Many people already reviewed that it's 4 20 min. programs of toning & cardio that can be customized with 1 warmup & cool down program.

The difference why everyone bought this is they don't use over amounts of makeup, perky workout outfits, or stop the workout to wipe off sweat, fix hair, etc, like most fitness dvds. They show you the real deal with them breathing hard, messing up & wanting to stop. You know how they feel, they aren't doing the fake smiles & editing all the minor errors, etc. It feels like a regular gym claass.

Bob, the personal trainer from the show even jokes that he doesn't have to do the workout, just guide the others & talk us into not giving up. I was pleasantly surprised with his style. He is very sweet, knows it's not fun & is really good at motivating you. He says happily it's ok if you can only lift your knee a little, etc., he never puts you down. He does show some modifications, etc. He talks 75% into the camera/you as if you were there. I've had other dvds where the instructor were very callous about saying not to stop, don't be a wimp, etc. which is very negative & studies have shown negativity rarely helps people challenge themselves.

Warmup: little over 4 min down outsides w/basic stretching, lunges, squats, side torse stretching, shoulder rolls, etc. shown with one contestant at a time.

Workout 1: Low Intensity Cardio: step touches, jumping jacks, lunges, squats, etc. The issue I have to thiw workout is the kickboxing segment, there is a lot of kicking & punching, but he doesn't tell you how to avoid injuries.

Workout 2: High Cardio: fake jump roping, skiing/skating, football running, tire running, punches/hooks, knee kicks.

Workout 3: Scuplt & Stretch: starts with weights for arms in different positions, then lungest, squats & plies. Next is floorwork for abs with reverse crunches, crunches for obliques, reg crunches & weights for triceps. Bridge pose in yoga w/1 leg up for the back/butt, the yoga plank kinda on elbows for abs & ends in child's pose.

Workout 4: Boot Camp w/weights: punching, arm raises, jumping jacks, push ups, plank, jumping, squats, simulating wood chopping, repeat 2x.

Cooldown: 10 min with Bob leading 5 of the contestants on a mountain doing basi stretches & some yoga like side angle, tree

I have been at it for over 3 weeks now, and am really feeling the benefits to how  I feel and how my clothes fit. My BMI has gone from 28+ to 26.9 in those three weeks--thanks in large part to the dvd and the show.

My only question is a big one: what is up with the 6 week plan with the 4 different workouts? Am I the only one who doesn't see how this is a six week workout? It says ""Weeks 1-3 alternate workouts #1 +# 3"" and ""Weeks 2-4"" alternate workouts #2 + #4.""

I sweat big time and yet find it uncomplicated and easy to follow.  I am not the most coordinated person in the world so doing lots of fancy combos on aerobic workouts doesn't work for me.  This was straightforward, got my heart rate up, and as I said, I sweat.

The only thing I wish they would improve is the music.  This is why I only gave it 4 stars.  Its practically non-existent and mostly you just hear Bob talking.  I like Bob, he's goofy, but I really like music when I work out.  So I just turn down the sound on my TV and put on my own music mix sometimes.

2437323,4,B000BQ7J70,"This is the first DVD that I could actually work out with. Mainly because I could relate to the people that were working out. I'd watched them during the previous seasons of The Biggest Loser and knew they had weight problems like myself. Call me silly, but I have a hard time being motivated by workout models that have never been a pound overweigt in their life. Seeing the former cast members made me feel like I could achieve the success they did.

I found the DVD easy to follow along with. I also found that the testimonials from Matt and Suzy very inspiring. Whenever I didn't feel like doing my workout, I'd watch their story's and I'd be motivated to get up and moving.

At the beginning, there were times I'd move in place because I could not keep up. The DVD will let you select your own workouts. If you want to do the Cardio with a warm up and cool down, fine, you can select it to do that. If you want to do 2 segments of the Boot Camp back to back, you can select the DVD to do that. After about 3 weeks, I found that I could do two of the workout routines along with the warm up/stretching routines without stopping. And boy did the weight come off! Over 30 lbs my first month!

My wife has bad knees and could not do all of the exercises on the DVD. So if you have joint problems, this DVD will have limited value for you. Other than that, this is a great starter DVD to get your weight loss going.",1158451200,13,1415,4.138181818181818

We have been doing these workouts for about 3 months.  I could keep going with them, but my husband is sick of them.

2437326,3,B000BQ7J70,"This DVD features trainer Bob Harper and cast members from The Biggest Loser TV show (Seth, Gary, Matt, Suzy, etc.). The DVD is broken into 2 cardio workouts and 2 sculpting workouts plus 1 warmup and 1 cooldown that are used for all of the workouts. They have a menu that allows you to pick and choose a workout regimen from these pieces or pick a ready-made workout. Love that!

Warmup (5 mins.): This is a stretch-type warmup vs. a cardio-type warmup--stretches, lunges and squats. Basic stuff.

Low Intensity Cardio (20 mins.): Includes some basic cardio warmup and then moves into a light kickbox-style cardio. Being a kickbox fan, it was nice to see some basic kickboxing techniques here.  However, just about every other kickboxing workout I've ever done has explained how to punch and kick to not injure yourself and Bob doesn't. As an experienced kickboxer, this was a minor irritation--I just did it how it SHOULD be done, not how he said to do it. But for people new to kickboxing, I am concerned that he doesn't explain proper technique.

High Intensity Cardio (20 mins.): Begins with a faux-jump-rope cardio warmup and moved into some plyometric moves (jumping side to side quickly, etc.), football-style agility drills, high knee lifts and also some kickboxing techniques here too. Definitely intense.

Strength & Sculpt (20 mins.): He does 1-minute circuits of upper body then lower body activity--upper body is lifting weights and lower body is squats and lunges while holding weights. I felt almost every exercise, especially when he has you pulsing or holding those squats and plies. About half of this workout is standing and the rest is on the floor. The floor work is mostly abs but with some buns and triceps.

Boot Camp (20 mins.): Starts out with kickbox punches using weights and moves into calisthenics in 1-minute intervals like in the previous workout. The pace is intense...right when you finish one exercise and you're begging for rest, he pushes you right into the next exercise.

Cooldown (5 mins.): I LOVE this cooldown. It is filmed on a rocky outcropping on a hill that looks like the one they made them climb on the TV show. They do multiple stretches and balance moves in this beautiful outdoor setting.

The biggest weakness of the cardio workouts is that they use only that generic Biggest Loser background music from the TV show. As a result, with no beat, the exercisers get out of synch with each other, with the trainer, and I get out of synch with all of them on a regular basis. This is a REAL PAIN because I otherwise like this DVD quite a bit.

If you are a fan of the TV show The Biggest Loser and especially if you watched the season that included these people, it is a great benefit because you feel like you already know them. There is a great sense of camaraderie and history with Bob and the group. It is obvious that they have all been through this hard work before and it is motivating to see what they look like and feel like now and realize the hard work it took to get there. The only person who really gets on my nerves is Drea during the sculpt workout (too much ego).",1157155200,67,3128,4.641952983725136
2437327,4,B000BQ7J70,"This DVD provides four different workouts, including warm up and cool down, or allows you to create your own workouts.  It is designed so that you alternate cardio and weight resistance workouts on alternate days, and you can do an easier or harder version of both.  I combine the workouts with either yoga or pilates and find that is enough for me.  If you are extremely fit, this is probably not for you.  It is excellent for those just starting out, or wanting to ""get in the game,"" as Bob the trainer says.  If you enjoyed the show, you will like the DVD.",1156377600,3,559,4.388349514563107

And today, i can barely work, and do not have the range of motion i normally do.

I hurt!!! majorly, and believe me, im not an unfit person, i have had many a personal trainer session.

Im assuming because i hurt so much, that infact it is very good, or im doing something incredibly wrong.

But if i feel like this every time i do it, i may lose interest, in feeling like im pregnant everytime i try to walk!!

Its unlike many videos i have brought before, infact i prefer a more dancey typed video.  but for squats, press-up's, lunges etc, this is great.

And bob does make you keep going, "" don't turn it off"" ""keep going"" and the others struggling does help!! cause believe me, u will yell at that screen!",1155859200,,793,4.3175675675675675

I love this DVD. The music is redundant but the work out is worth it!

The trainer is great! he keeps you motivated without annoying you with constant delays when holding a move.

I have gotten great results from the short time that i have been doing it. Its options to customize your workout allow you to change it up on days where you don't want to do cardio because you have gone for a walk or don't want to do weights because you did them the day before.

I have yet to try the 6 week program but its put together from the same workouts as the customized workouts so its doable.

At first i couldn't keep up but seeing the participants also not be able to keep up encouraged me to keep trying.

ITs a great Workout and the fact that you are trying to keep up with people who are not perfect (skinny) makes you feel like you can do it too!

I bought it for my wedding toning and for a change and i don't regret it, i would buy another one and give it as a gift to my mother, in fact i think i will do that!!!

I think any one at any level can do this workout because it isn't hard at all.

Cant wait for the other DVD's from this trainer!!!",1155254400,3,1152,3.973913043478261

2437333,5,B000BQ7J70,"Being a workout DVD junkie you find out very quickly that it's hard to be dedicated to one DVD.  Not only is it tricky to stick to one DVD and remain motivated, most of the workouts simply get predictable and boring.  This DVD just isn't like that.  Although the mention of the workout having a 20 minute cool-down stretch is a big fat lie (it's more like 11 minutes), this DVD is totally worth the hype.

First and foremost, Bob Harper is fantastic.  He's super motivating - when he tells me to hold on and not give up I totally make the effort to do so.  He isn't over the top or annoying and he doesn't grate on your nerves like some other DVD instructors (like Denise Austin can - especially when you're working out early in the morning and you're not a morning person).  He makes you sweat and your muscle burn.  I've never sweat like this before...So much sweat I had to change how often I wash my hair, I had to buy new workout wear (the less the better), the whole nine yards.  But if feels good - so good.  I like it too that he sneaks in a little yoga here and there throughout the cool-down that is doable for all levels - nothing to make you dizzy or anything yet still provides a good stretch.  And, might I add, it doesn't hurt that he's a complete cutie.  Just one of those guys that's hot because he's good-looking on the outside and has a great personality to boot.

Second, the fact that the people working out with Bob are real people makes the whole process so much easier and your plight seem much more manageable.  I'm by no means a big girl.  For the most part I stay around 130lbs which is pretty good for my 5'6"" frame.  But my goodness, I can only take so much of watching tiny and skinny women workout behind equally tiny and skinny trainers on other DVDs.  Those chicks don't even break a sweat!  They don't motivate me nearly as much as the real life folks from the show The Biggest Loser that are sweating and moaning and strugglin' just as much as I am.  It makes me feel that I'm not alone in my struggle to stay fit.  I complain and sweat and moan and groan and fall over just as much as the cast and I don't feel bad about it - I feel human.

Third, you will see results.  I'm only looking to loose about 5-10lbs and to tone up and the 6 week program on this DVD is definitely working!  My arms, legs, hips and butt are really starting to take shape.  Like I stated earlier, you will be sweating, your muscles will burn (Bob apparently loves squats and lunges - a lot), you will be moaning and complaining.  You can totally feel the body getting a good healthy warm-up, workout and cool-down.  Just what most of us need!

If you are looking to loose weight, tone up and work towards a healthier life style this is the workout DVD to get.  It will benefit anyone at the beginner and more advanced levels and make definite changes in your body.  But if you're afraid to work up a little sweat, prefer sitting on your couch and you're wanting to make your contribution to the obesity trend that this country is currently riding, this is not the DVD for you.",1153958400,12,3088,4.248713550600343

The have a 6 week program that allows you to reach that marked 6 week goal to see exactly where the program leads you.  The people are REAl meaning there are no experts doing the exercises they are people like you and I.  In the beginning of the video you get to see where they came from so that you to can change like they did.

It is true as a couple reviewers said that deep knee lunges and squats are not for the obese, but the idea is to keep moving and stop being obese!. I had a BMI of 31 when I started. I just did little moves during those segments. Here it is two month later and I have a BMI of 29 and I am lunging lower (still not anywhere near Suzy). It is encouraging to see imperfect people struggling to stay steady as they exercise.

2437337,5,B000BQ7J70,"I hate cardio DVDs.  I hate them with a passion that I can't even begin to express.  This is the first cardio workout that I have been able to finish the first time I tried.  Not because it's easy ('cause it's not) but because it was presented perfectly.

I watch The Biggest Loser, so knowing the people in the dvd helped a lot.  It was great to see normal people doing these things.  Yes, some of the moves are intense (deep lunges, boy push-ups, etc) but I remember when these people couldn't do those things.  Also, Bob is very accomodating to that.  He encourages you to try, but to know your limits.  When I started, I could barely do the lunges.  Now, I'm going almost as deep as suzy.. and it's awesome.

I'm still on the easy one.  I tried both the bootcamp and the high intensity.  Neither are easy.  It was enough to get me to go back to low intensity and feel ok about it.

Try it.  stick with it.  All he cares about is that you're moving.  If you can't do something, just move side to side.

My only disappointment is that there is a ""customize your work-out"".  It's not what I thought it would be.  So far, it looks like I'll only benefit from it if I do the cardio first, then add the sculpt.  But if that's the only thing wrong with it.. that's not too bad.",1152662400,,1274,4.177685950413223

I have a few pounds I'd like to lose, but I'm rather adept at workout videos and usually require something intermediate to advanced to get my heart going.  I loved the trainers on the show and thought this would be fun and not overly ""staged.""

The Biggest Loser Workout definitely exceeded my expectations.

The DVD allows you to make your own routine or follow a 6 week program (with combinations already set). The high-intensity workout was simple, but tough and the sculpting portion paired perfectly. I'm excited to try out the different workouts.

2437340,5,B000BQ7J70,"Let me preface this by saying I'm a huge TaeBo fan.  I mean huge.  I bought the original infomercial set, then did TaeBo Live, paid to watch the TaeBo workouts on DirecTV in 2000, have the Get Ripped series and just bought the Boot Camp.  So you get the idea...I like TaeBo and I don't stray that often to try something new.

I was completely blown away by this DVD!  The high intensity cardio workout rivals, if not exceeds, any and I mean ANY TaeBo workout I've ever done.  The trainer is effecient and so are your moves and the entire workout.  Not a single wasted motion.  Not a one.

If you are a workout fanatic or just thinking about it, this DVD needs to be in your library.  If you don't believe the almost perfect 5 star rating this DVD has earned on Amazon, then rent it first.  Once you do, you will be impressed.  I'm sure of it.",1147910400,11,842,4.19375

I enthusiastically recommend this for people who are just getting started again--regardless of what an athlete you used to be.  I'm sore, but not too sore.

2437345,5,B000BQ7J70,"As you can see from my other reviews, I'm not an automatic five star reviewer; I'm not afraid to say when I like something and when I don't. But let me tell you, I love this workout video! It features a low intensity cardio, a high intensity cardio, a fairly easy weight training section which is meant to be added onto a cardio workout, a tremendously difficult bootcamp workout, and beginning and ending stretches. The best part is that all the workouts are 20 minutes, and they fly by so quickly you'll barely realize you worked out at all (but believe me, you'll feel the results). Having tried a number of yoga workout routines which often take at least 45 minutes, I've come to the realization that anything that takes that long, I won't actually do on a daily basis. And it's a lot more important that you do a little something every day, rather than do a whole lot every now and again. This workout, however, fits perfectly into my day: I always have the time and motivation to put my 20 minutes in. And you'll get all the benefits of some of those longer workouts, because of the way everything is effectively crammed into short, intense bursts of activity.

What's also great is that these are truly real people doing a realistic workout. You won't feel defeated when by the end of the kickboxing section you're wobbling around, because the people doing the workout are struggling right along with you! It really feels like a social experience doing these workouts, all in the privacy of your own home. I honestly cannot recommend this video highly enough! My only criticism is that it may be a bit too intense for people that are really out of shape. This isn't solved by the low intensity version of the workout, either; its focus on lunges and squats (and holding those poses for long stretches of time) seems to me even more difficult than the faster-paced movement in the high intensity workout. Anyhow, before you give up on the video after trying the low intensity routine, see if you don't find the high intensity cardio actually easier in many ways. And after a few weeks of doing this workout, you'll be ready to get in the game!",1146528000,17,2149,4.581818181818182
2437346,4,B000BQ7J70,"I didn't see the show, but on the DVD the workouts are effective and *mostly* easy to follow. I like Bob's encouragement, and I like that the real people in this look like they really are enjoying it, versus the pasted-on tight smiles so typical in other DVDs of this type.

However, the cardio can be a little hard to follow. Bob does more coaching than actual doing, and the only reason that's bad is because his exercisers are all slightly out of sync with each other. Since the music doesn't have a heavy downbeat or bass, it doesn't help you to find the correct tempo. You'll have to find your own tempo and be content with that.

Overall, though, it's a good workout DVD that requires a minimum of equipment and is very time-effective. It's also good for small-to-moderate sized spaces.

2437374,5,B000BQ7J70,"I am a huge fan of the show, and find the contestants' personal stories to be very encoraging. I do not usually like aerobics, and am more of a gym-person. However, I truly enjoyed this workout. The warm-up, Low Intensity workout, and cool-down were the fastest 50 minutes I have ever spent exercising. I attribute this to the motivating, but not cheesy, style of the trainer, Bob Harper. Also, having demonstrators who have actually lost weight with this program instead of professionals was inspirational. There are also lower intensity options for people who can't keep up with the workout which keep your heartrate up and keep you moving without feeling left behind. I would definately recommend this DVD to anyone who likes the show and wants a good, make-you-sweat workout. Also, I believe people who have not tried working out to a DVD at home would enjoy it.",1142812800,,866,4.858108108108108

They are real not super thin live in the gym bimbos.  Also, Bob is very encouraging.  He does not make you feel like you should be living in the gym to be able to keep up.

I have to agree with some of the others though, in that because they are ""regular"" people, they are all moving at different paces. I think you just need to focus on one person and keep that pace and you will be fine..the other good thing is you can customize a workout to fit any time frame because there are several segments to choose from..",1142553600,,504,4.142857142857143

The workouts are not too easy, but not too difficult either.  Bob Harper gets you moving in simple motions rather than a Tae Bo workout that takes some getting use to for a beginner.  I highly recommend this video!

The custom workouts are great!  My wife and I will choose Strength and Sculpt combined with Boot Camp or Low Intensity with Boot Camp.  The only drawback is that you can't choose the order of custom workouts.  You have to do them in the order they are listed in the DVD.",1142553600,,660,4.174603174603175

It is definitely challenging, but you get maximum results in minimum time. As a few reviewers have stated, there are parts where the contestants are visibly struggling with both the instructions and the workout itself, but I didn't find it frustrating; in fact, I thought it was kind of refreshing. It helped me to remember that it's okay to goof up; and that not everyone is a size 3. Excellent product.",1142553600,4,529,4.578947368421052

I am very pleased with this purchase and look forward to another workout DVD that Bob may have.  I am almost 59 and am trying to lose weight while getting toned.

2437392,4,B000BQ7J70,"This is a HARD workout.  Both in a good way and in a bad way.  First of all, since you are watching the participants from the TV Show along with the trainer, it can sometimes be difficult to follow along (because everyone is going at his or her own pace).  Be aware that there will be jumping jacks and/or running in place, so if you have trouble with your knees or do not want to be jumping, keep this in mind before you purchase this DVD.

On the positive side, though, I love that you can ""customize"" what order you would like to do your workouts (you get to choose from the 6 or 7 options at the beginning of the DVD and then you don't have to worry about anything once you press Play).  Also, these are difficult workouts...so if you stick with it, you will definitely see results!

I would recommend it to anyone who loves the show and really wants a good workout.  If you are not easily distracted by everyone working out at a different speed, you will enjoy this DVD.",1142380800,2,975,4.237837837837838

I love a good cardio workout and don't want to watch some cutesy young girl that likes to dance around for cardio. This DVD offers 6 different workouts at 2 different levels with real people. There is a high intensity workout that is great and you see some of the people from the Biggest Loser struggling along with you. There is no fake smile plastered on their face and they are really sweating with you. And Bob is a great motivator. He doesn't babble on and somehow when he is counting down on a particular exercise, you don't want to give up, you want to keep going.

2437404,5,B000BQ7J70,"I bought The Biggest Loser Workout, Volume 1 based on watching the television series. I thought if those trainers can get the contestants on the Biggest Loser to lose all that weight it has to be worth the money to purchase the DVD. I wasn't sure what to expect of the workouts on the DVD, however, I was pleasantly surprised when I tried the DVD for the first time. There are four different workout routines, then within the four workout routines there are two workout routines(cardio & strength training) that they want you to rotate between a six week timeframe. For example the first week you do low intesity cardio three days, alternating  the other three days with the low intesity strength training (you will need hand weights). These routines breakup the fact that you are doing the same workout everyday. Then the second week you would do a different number workout routine. Alternating again between cardio and strength training. The DVD also allows you to customize your own workout routine. Each workout has a warmup and cool down period.

As far as the exercises I loved them from the first time I tried them. The movements are very easy to follow and Bob, the trainer, is VERY encouraging that if you can't do a exercise movement, stick with the exercise movement that you can do for your body, as long as you keep moving. And the best part is that you see the Biggest Loser contestants struggling with the workout just like you are at home in your own house. It's not a fake DVD where there are skinny models who don't break a sweat or have no problem doing the workout. You will enjoy seeing that they are sweating and struggling along with you! I love this DVD and would recommend it to all my friends who want to lose weight like I do! Hey, I lost 20lbs in less than two months!

I am on my 3rd week and can see tremendous results.  I'm stronger, leaner, and can see my problem areas disappearing.  So can my friends and family!  I have been recommending this workout DVD to everyone I come in contact with.  Bob is real.  He pushes you but knows that everyone has their limitations.  The cast are still in their weightloss programs and at times can't keep up.  It just makes the whole process that much more down to earth and fun unlike other exercise videos where the participants are in great shape like the trainer.

I think it's great that they are not all in step with each other; but they always keep trying. And Bob never fails to elicit a smile from me, his energy and laughter are infectious (even through the pain!).

Great if you are starting out or starting over after gaining weight.

2437427,5,B000BQ7J70,"I love the Biggest Loser Exercise CD. It is easy to use no matter what my exercise goal for the day, week or month is. I like being able to customize workouts. Lets face it we don't always have 45 minutes to workout. The workouts are taylored to my needs and allow for changes in my strength and flexibility.",1141257600,,308,4.237288135593221
2437428,5,B000BQ7J70,"This video is amazing! By far the best workout I have ever had..I have tried a lot of workout videos.  The first week I had the video, I did the beginner workout 3x that week and lost 4 lbs.  I highly recommend this video!!",1141171200,,223,4.045454545454546
2437429,4,B000BQ7J70,"This tape has some good strength building workouts, but to me the aerobics part of it is kind of joint pounding, I perfer to use it only periodically, The Firm is a much better all around workout.",1140998400,3,196,4.324324324324325
2437430,5,B000BQ7J70,"I really like this video. It has different programs - i.e. low impact, high impact, boot camp, body sculpting, etc.  The low impact has been plenty challenging for me right now.  I can feel it in my abs, butt, thighs, you name it.  I like that I have more challenging workouts once I master this level.

Bob is funny.  I always liked him on the show and now I like him even more!  He just comes across as such a cool down-to-earth guy.  They should sell those blue shirts the cast members wear that say ""I love Bob"".  lol.

The ONLY negative thing I can say is that some parts of the workout (mainly jumping and lunges) are hard for me because of knee problems and Bob doesn't always provide an alternative move to do in their place.  But I've been able to modify them or do another move to keep my heart rate up.

I like that some of the cast members struggle with some of the moves in the video also.  It doesn't make me feel as bad when I can't keep up but I know if I keep working on it as they did I'll get there!!!",1140998400,,1020,4.045

Bob is funny and makes you laugh too.  10 stars on this one.",1140998400,2,352,4.014285714285714

2437433,5,B000BQ7J70,"I have enjoyed this DVD a lot.  It has a variety of workouts available which is helpful because having a variety tends to help people to stick to a workout plan.  It also has the option to turn off the trainer voice and just have the music as you get used to the workouts.  Also, you can customize your own workout as well.

One thing I enjoy about this DVD over the ""bouncing barbie"" DVD's is that it features real people who sometimes mess up the timing, they get visibly tired and it just seems more authentic to me somehow.  I have learned a lot of new moves and how to use my own body as resistance.  Thanks to this DVD and a sensible weight loss plan, learning to count my calories and be accountable to myself I have lost a LOT of weight.  I look and feel better than I ever have and I know I'm not going to fall off the wagon!

A very inspirational video from a very inspirational show.  Informative and well worth the investment.",1140912000,,938,4.195530726256983

They sweat, they grunt, and they even complain.  That is real life and that is why this is both powerful and effective.  I know I enjoyed working out to this tape.",1140825600,,438,4.280487804878049

The people certainly motivate you to keep going, your not looking at a video of perfect bodies so its easy to relate to them.

Saying this you can personalise your workouts , pick and choose which ones you want to do or do all of them.  The workouts are short but extremely effective.  You can do cardio, then do the strength to sculpt beautiful muscles.  The boot camp is also a double whammy but with great results.  I recommend this dvd to male or female.  To any fitness level because you go along at your pace, and it's so much fun doing a video with people that are just like the majority of the population, not someone who's 80lbs soaking wet.  lol",1140739200,,609,4.522935779816514

In three of the workouts you are huffing and puffing, sweating and tired but the people on the DVD are too !!!!  I have really enjoyed this DVD, other workout videos that I have tried are hard to do because the people on them look like they could go another 30 minutes or longer if you let them.  Here on the Biggest Looser DVD you see people stopping because they are tired or their arms or legs are buring.  Bob does a great job letting you know what you should and should not do he tells you to listen to your body and what you can do.  It is also lots of fun to see the people doing the workout and Bob go back and forth it makes you working out that much easier, it takes your mind off of what you are doing.  I just want people to know who buy this DVD is that it works !!!!  I am loosing weight and my pants fit better so that makes me want to do it even more !!!!!  Summer will be here before you know it.

I recommend this one to everyone!  Good cardio and from years spent at the gym, the movements are A-1!  Lots of lunges and squats that will tone you up fast!  Glad I ordered it and the people backing up the trainer

are common folks.  I always felt intimidated by workout videos where the people looked like super models! Get this video....I'm 55 and feeling alot younger each week as I see more and more results!  Bob Harper does a great job keeping you motivated!",1140739200,,811,4.833333333333333

Having him ""in my living room"" on a daily basis is the best gift I could've given myself.  He is very inspirational and is with you step-by-step.  I also like the fact that ""real"" people are working out along with you instead of Barbie cutouts.

I like the pace of the workout; he gets your heart rate up and keeps it there.  But it's not so challenging that you want to turn it off.  YOU WILL SWEAT - make no mistake!  But I feel SO good after it's over, that I carry that pride with me for the rest of the day.  The warmup is simple and to the point, and the cool down is relaxing.  Good job, Biggest Loser DVD!

I am very much an asthmatic in fact I have PE enduced asthma and have always had a difficult time exercising but I wanted to find something I enjoyed doing so that I would stay motivated.  I am about 40 pounds over weight and decided to start exercising and change my diet to 1200 calories a day.  I set a goal to work out 3-4 times a day even though the video recommends 6.  I have been working out every day for the last 3 and half weeks (until I got a cold 2 days ago) and I am addicted.  The video is great bc it gives you options of which work outs to do so you are always able to feel the ""burn"" the next day which I enjoy, and you are not bored doing the same thing every time.  I have lost 10 lbs in almost 4 wks and I am so proud!  I know its not much but I feel better just working out and living healthier and I know I getting closer to my goal.  The video is a little difficult at first (the low impact) but keep trying and just do what you can and then try again the next time... you'll get it!  And its so worth it.

Its very easy to follow and one of the things I love the most is that the cast memeber doing the workouts are haveing a hard time doing the same things you are.  Its not like most tapes where you are very tired and the people on the tv haven't even broken a sweat.  Its a great work out, one of the coolest things about it is you can design your own work out by combining the different work outs.

The most you move is either side to side or forward and backward. If you can keep up with Bob GREAT....but the good part is you work at your own level. The moves are NOT complicated, nor do you have to be coordinated like in some of those crazy dance aerobics. It is all about repetition and slight modifications to various moves. There is a low intensity workout, a high intenstity workout, a sculpting workout (with small 1, 3 or 5 lb weights, and a boot camp workout. In my opinion EVERY one of them gets your heart rate pumping and that is the main focus of this video....TO KEEP MOVING. All the workouts are on average 20-25 min minus the warm up and cool down. I have been doing this workout 5-6 days a week since Jan and have lost 7 lbs. You won't see huge results right away but after the 6th week I have noticed a slight change in my appearance.

Although the ""real people"" are inspiring, their form in performing the exercises is not always good, so you might get thrown off. Watch Bob do the exercises and you'll be fine.

The ""custom workout"" option is a great feature; do the low intensity followed by the weight training after you've gotten accustomed to the workout, and you'll feel great!

After 4 weeks I can get through the low-intensity and the weight training segments; the high intensity and boot camps are still a little strenuous for me.  But I'm losing and toning, and feeling good doing the DVD, and nothing succeeds likes success!",1140652800,,831,4.703448275862069

2437478,5,B000BQ7J70,"I bought this DVD because I LOVE the show!  I have lost 50lbs in the past and know what it's like to struggle with weight, even if I didn't have as far to go as the contestants.  When I watch the show I wish I could have trainers like Bob & Jillian!  I now run marathons (training for my fourth) so I am in great shape.  Anyone who is a runner knows that many a runner's downfall is a lack of cross training.  I decided to get the Biggest Loser DVD to see if it would help me focus on strength training and low-impact cross training.  I couldn't believe how it kicked my butt (and arms and back and abs and calves and quads...)!  I thought I was going to cry during some of the squat segments!  Even the knee raises had my hip flexors working and feeling it about as hard as running 20+ miles feels--no joke (although recovery is MUCH shorter doing the workout)!!

I have spent a good deal of my life dancing and am very coordinated, so complicated, dancy workouts are just fine for me.  This one isn't that and I love it too!  It's simple; I don't have to think too hard.  Each workout starts with a basic step, making it easy to fall back in if you lose your place/balance.  The exercisers are contestants (YAY), so they are real people who mess up the steps on occasion, laughing at themselves all the while.  It sounds cheesy, but I feel like I am working out with friends.  Bob makes it fun--I was smiling despite my gritted teeth!  The customization of the workouts is a great option!

I agree with another reviewer that the ""6-week"" program is a little confusing because it says ""Weeks 1-3"" and ""Weeks 2-4""--perhaps it's supposed to be ""1-3"" and ""4-6""?  Regardless, anyone can figure it out.  Also, the DVD cover says that the Cool Down segment is 20 minutes, but it's actually 10 (good to know since some people tend to skip cool downs and might shy away if they think it's 20 minutes).  I did find that I needed to stretch more after though--it worked my muscles so hard I felt I needed more long stretches!

As for needed equipment, all you really need is dumbells.  You can use a mat or towel for floor work, but the plain old floor will work just fine as well (the ab work can be tough on the back without a mat though).  As far as weights go, I have been using 3lbs weights (yeah, haven't been focusing on the upper body much lately)--I am hoping to move up to 5lbs in a couple weeks, then maybe (MAYBE) 8lbs.  If you're new to weight stuff, start light!  You will still get plenty of benefits from lighter weights--there's lots of reps, lots of isolation, holding.  I had to put down the weights for part of the Boot Camp section and I even grabbed 1lb ankle weights to use for the rest of the section!  Yee-ouch!

The DVD isn't perfect models/perfect form/perfect music.  You shouldn't be looking for that.  What it IS is a great workout that's fun, real, not too difficult (as far as coordination goes) and a real challenge to your body--without being intimidating.  Bob is light hearted, friendly and will kick your butt!  I think anyone who uses this program will be able to see real progress as they work--I look forward to seeing mine!  I am feeling muscles I haven't felt in a long while and I look forward to seeing how everything improves--including my running (upper body and core strength really help with speed and endurance!).  Maybe now I will able to shed those LAST 8lbs!

Oh yeah, and after only one workout, two co-workers bought the DVD based on my recommendation!",1140566400,2,3497,4.394080996884735
2437479,5,B000BQ7J70,"Great workout!!  It's nice that there is a variety of workouts for the beginner (though it's a tough workout), sculpting, advanced with stretching before and afterwards.  Bob knows his stuff!!!  I recommend it to beginners who are in a little more advanced stages since the trainer Bob really works your abs, thighs and butt by doing lunges and squats.  Still a great workout to do at home if you have 30 mins free time.",1140566400,,420,4.635135135135135

I consider myself in decent shape, I'm just trying to lose those last 10 pounds and this was a challenging workout for me, especially the boot camp!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because there were a lot of lunges in the workouts, which is really hard on the knees.",1140393600,2,567,4.456310679611651

She is featured in almost every segment, and whenever it gets difficult she starts to whine and complain.  Some might find this motivating, I find it irritating.

It was real people trying to lose weight for their own personl reasons. I love that the DVD gives you the option to choose your own workout depending on how much time you have or the level at which you want to workout. It is great to see people experience the same problems most would face while doing the workout. Often you buy DVDs with instructors who have been doing this for over 10 years. They do the exericses with ease which can be intimidating for those just starting to exercise again. This DVD proves that not everyone goes at the same pace and gives people hope who are trying to achieve weight loss. I cannot wait for another DVD to come out!,1139961600,4,771,4.216216216216216

Well, two days later I'm still sore! It was great fun, really got my heart rate up and made me sweat! Bob is soo encouraging, albeit a little cheesy. My only complaint is that the demonstrators can't stay in time with the music, Bob, or eachother, so it's easy to get distracted and mess up. Other than that they're great!

I do the workouts six days a week. They are a lot of fun. We all love Bob, so he is great. I love that everyone is struggling...it hurts a little bit though because they are all going at different times which can mess you up a bit. The only other things that I didn't LOVE was the low intensity workout..I think it's the hardest of them all...I don't mind it but I think Bob needed to rethink the length of the lunge segment. It goes on forever and I think it too hard for beginners. I STILL can't do it over a month later and I can do every other workout with no problem. Even the contestants can't do it. I don't love the cooldown either. I don't know why. I don't find it relaxing, and I find it to be a little long and slow. I love the weights segments. That is my FAVORITE!

I like that he does not count how many reps you are suppost to do, it is meant to work at your own pace.  I also enjoy that it is real people starting out like me and they want to quit sometimes like I do.  I also like that you have 4 workouts in one DVD and for a great price.  You also don't need a lot of equipment just yourself and some weights.  It has really challenged me and I enjoy a good challenge.

It's fun to watch when Matt screws up in the routine and laughs about it.  Some reviewers on this site said it was confusing, but I feel its easy to follow the verbal instructions of Bob Harper and you can go at your own pace.  I have mainly put my own packages together with cardio and strenth training combos, which is great to be able to mix it up.

2437506,3,B000BQ7J70,"So far, I'm only in the middle of this dvd as I'm writing this, but I'm not impressed so far.  I was so looking forward to this, but it's not the best I've seen.  If you know my reviews, I've done many aerobics dvds, and this falls short of other better workouts out there.  So far, the warm up is choppy with no real flow, and the low intensity aerobics is a mish mash.  Bob isn't working out too; he's just standing around watching them all and talking smack to the camera.  His cuing is very poor.  The exercisers are doing the best they can, but they are all out of time and no rhythm or get up and go.  I know they are 'real' people and I give them kudo's for being on tape, but they are only role models due to the weight they lost, not the way they are working out here.  If you try to imitate them, you won't be doing a great job.  Gary works out the best.  He's lost so much weight - I think it's because he looks and is more physical than the others.  You as a viewer need to put more effort into this than what the contestants are doing.  Other than that, the actuall exercises are good and should be done 4-5 times a week for your own results.",1138320000,2,1155,3.995633187772926

You could hardly hear the background music, but it didn't matter because there is no rhythm at all to the exercises they are doing.  I consider myself to be seasoned at working out to aerobics, and I have to have a beat, and a rhythm.  Everyone was doing their own thing, and I thought I'd be able to follow Bob, but he just mainly walked around and did not lead.  I was extremely disappointed and will most likely return the DVD.",1138233600,18,484,4.285714285714286

The workouts are structured to keep your heartrate up without killing you, but the first few times I found it hard to do some of the exercies as long as they do on the video, and am getting better, but I still have to stop every now and then, which gives me something to work towards.

I definitely recommend this!!",1138233600,4,575,4.345794392523365

I consider myself an active person, and these workouts are tough.  If you are looking to sweat, you will.  What I love about this workout that is different from many others is the fact that you are working out with people that are going through the process with you.  They are not scripted going into this workout regime.  You hear their pain and feel it along with them.  That is reassuring.  I loved ""The Biggest Loser"" show and I can see if they were trained at this intensity each week how the weight kept dropping off.  If you are looking for a new challenge to your workout, this is definately the tape for you.  If you are a beginner to working out, this tape would be challenging.

In the 6-week plan menu it tells you to alternate certain routines between weeks 1-3 and 2-4.  This is not six weeks. Should it have been 1-3 and 4-6?  I can't imagine after only one week going on to the high intensity and boot camp segments. I can barely make it through the low intensity.  Otherwise, I think this video is great.  I love that it's real people.  People who struggle and mess up occasionally.  This is me, it's who I am right now.  Maybe when I am perfect (ha ha) I will want a video with perfect people. But, for now, this is the best thing I could ask for.  Oh, I almost forgot, it's great that this can be done in a small space.  I don't have a very big living room and I'm not ready for a gym.

2437513,4,B000BQ7J70,"If you're familiar with the show, this is Bob Harper's routines on the DVD (Jillian Michaels is nowhere to be found).  The segments offered include the trainer taking up to six of the contestants through a typical workout with him.  They say what makes this DVD different than others is the fact they use ""normal people"" in the room with Bob.  They are the contestants who have been excercising with him for a while. The difficulty level of these workouts are pretty accelerated if you've never worked out before.  People with joint problems are going to find the constant jumping and kicking somewhat daunting.  The worst aspect of this DVD is the people who will want to use it the most may not be able to.  They do offer modified versions of the moves at certain times, but for the most part you better be ready to jump and do deep knee bends.  Bob talks you through every segment, and thankfully you can choose a ""music only"" option once you have the routines down (a nice touch for people who do this every day).

There are six routines to choose from, and you can mix and match from the following:

Warm-up (5 minutes) - Basic stretching moves to get you ready to go.

Low Intensity Cardio (25 minutes) - Some jumping jacks, some kicking and punching, and a lot of core strengthening excercises for the begginer.

High-Intensity Cardio (20 minutes) - A more aggressive cardio routine designed for people who have been working out for at least a month.  The moves are quick, and there's a lot more jumping.  It's constant motion combined with boxing and kicking moves.

Strength and Sculpt (20 minutes) - Use hand weights and a mat or towel to go through a circuit training routine designed to build muscle and sculpt.

Boot Camp (20 minutes) - A combination of of cardio and sculpting that can be done with or without hand weights.  This is for people who need a quick workout, and do not have time for both a cardio and sculpting routine.

Cool Down (20 minutes) - Yoga style stretching to get you back to normal after an intense workout.

You can select a combination of routines pre-matched for you, or customize the routines by choosing any combination of the above.  Menus are easy enough to navigate, and you shouldn't find it hard to get to where you need to be depending on what your level is.  Following along should be easy enough.  The only distraction is sometimes the contestants are out of synch with the rest of the group, or they modify the movement according to their body type.  I guess the trick is to zero in on the contestant that has your fitness level at first and follow them, but it does make it strange to see people doing variations of the same thing.

The DVD itself looks fine for what it is.  Picture and sound are clear, and we get them in fullscreen and simple stereo.  Special features include a six week suggested plan, a cast and trainer intro, and Matt and Suzy's story for inspiration.  Also tucked in to this package are corporate sponsor 24 Hour Fitness commercials, a message from the fitness company's CEO, and a certificate good for ""30 Days Free"" at a local 24 Hour Fitness gym.  For less than ten dollars you knew someone was going to try and sell you something.

The workouts are a great way to get started.  Bob is a pretty detailed trainer even on DVD, but he still can't replace a session with a real fitness expert live in front of you.  I'd say this is a good DVD for people who are pressed for time, can't get to a gym, or need to start off doing things in the privacy of the home before going public at the local fitness palace.  Gyms can be intimidating, and as long as you move and do something it's better than nothing.  If you're a fan of The Biggest Loser this is a good way to start moving with some familiar faces looking back at you.  But don't expect it to be easy!  It takes a lot of work to lose big.",1137801600,185,3869,4.425742574257426

Since I am over 100 pounds overweight, I thought I should try the low impact, first. I was so exhausted from this workout that I could not do the cool down segment. However, because of all the squats and lunges in this segment, my knees are bothering me. So, if you have bad knees, beware. I really enjoy the weight training segment. It's short, yet effective.

Bob and the guys working out are so fun, inspiring, funny, and real it just makes you want to get going!  I also LOVE the fact he has the cool down and warmups included in any of the main workouts so you don't have to stop the dvd and go back to them on your own, they just automatically pop up there!  It's varied enough to keep your interest but routine enough to make you not have to overthink.  EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT VIDEO! I'd recommend it for ANYONE wanting to workout, regardless of fitness level, weight, age etc.  PUT OUT MORE VIDEOS YOU GUYS!!! I'll buy them ALL!!!",1137628800,14,1461,4.260869565217392

I only did the low impact to start, but I will continue to do this 6 days a week.  It was fun. Bob sure keeps you going.  I didn't notice as mentioned below, that the group could not keep up with the fitness, you should be concentrating on yourself, not judging others :)

I give it 5 stars !",1137542400,8,406,3.926829268292683
2437520,5,B000BQ7J70,Hi my name is jermiah and I weigh 500lbs. I felt motivated by the show to try the dvd. Because of my size even the warm-up is a workout for me. It hurt the first day..do not try upper level workouts..start with low impact..I got through the low workout today thanks for modifying some moves for myself..it really helped. I did sweat and stayed at it with Bob's motivation..thanks bob ....jeremiah aka tiny 500lbs. and dropping.,1137542400,,427,4.631578947368421
2437521,5,B000BQ7J70,"I just received this DVD today and did the first workout -- the low intensity cardio (+warm up and cool down/stretch).  I am by no means in shape, which was part of my motivation for buying this DVD.  I was thrilled to see these real people who make mistakes and struggle and SWEAT just like me.  It was a big motivator for my finishing the workout.  I am really looking forward to making changes for myself and working out with this video.  I know I will definitely feel the results tomorrow (I sure felt the burn today!), and can't wait to try out another segment of it.

I did not find the contestant's missteps to be distracting.  It was more motivation for me to just keep moving even if I messed up myself.  I also liked the modifications and did alternate those movements during the workout if I felt as if I couldn't do the full movement.

Overall I think this was well worth my money, and look forward to doing the other segments.  This is the first time in my life I have looked forward to working out.  I cannot wait to see the results.  I do hope there will be more volumes coming!",1137542400,9,1093,4.278048780487805
2437522,5,B000BQ7J70,"I bought this DVD to get into the habit of working out.  Being a fan of the show I thought this would be fun and keep my interest.  I absolutely love this DVD and the workout.  At first it was really challenging, but little by little it's getting easier and the workouts are great.  I already notice a difference in my stamina and endurance, not to mention losing three pounds in the first week.  I highly recommend this workout, and it's great that you can pick and choose the workouts you want, or follow their weightloss plan provided.",1137542400,12,538,4.448979591836735
2437523,5,B000BQ7J70,Best workout video I have ever bought.  I appreciate the fact that the people working out are struggling and off step.  Makes me feel as though I am working out with friends.  The moves are uncomplicated yet they really work your body.  I have found the most motivation from this DVD.  I haven't missed a workout in two weeks except for my off days.  That is a major accomplishment for me to be this motivated by a workout video. For the price you can't beat the value.  I also like the fact that Bob doesn't count.  You don't have to worry if you don't have the exact rhythm as him you just do the moves to your own time and ability.  If you are only able to do 3 moves in his time you just do 3.  As you get in shape the number of moves you do increases.,1137456000,8,756,4.0134228187919465
2437524,5,B000BQ7J70,"I bought this DVD after watching the second season of the show.  I actually bought this and Jillian Richards' DVD (the female trainer on the show) at the same time so I could alternate the workouts.  I must say I looked forward to this one much more that hers.  I like the fact that I know I'm not the only one struggling to keep up with the routine Bob (the male trainer on the show) has put together.  At times, the contestants are off step but that's ok because after a while you'll learn the routine and you won't need them to help you keep count.  I've managed to just look at the TV to see where they're at but I have my own music playing.",1137456000,5,645,4.087301587301587

I had my husband wake me up early this morning so I could get a start on my day by working out with Bob and the Biggest Loser contestants. I love that you can customize your workouts or you can chose to do the 6 week program which I have elected to do. I have to tell you all that this is the most grueling program I have seen since I left the Army. I worked my body so hard that I almost was sick but in a good way. After the first workout, I know I am going to commit to this program. Along with my low-carb lifestyle and this DVD I will make it to my goal weight which I have about 35-40 lbs to go now. As having many successes losing weight ( I went from 255 to 183 since July 2005), I am certain this is what will keep my motivation this 2006. It is a must buy!!!!

2437526,5,B000BQ7J70,"If you're ready to work those pounds off then this DVD is just the thing....its VERY user friendly - you can create your own workout or go with the 6 week pre-determined workout setup. I just got the dvd last night and did the warm up, low instensity, and cool down and was SWEATING afterwards! It really gets your heart rate up - yes there are jumping jacks but Andrea shows a modified version and I was alternating between the two. It was really nice to see REAL people working out and sweating just like I do. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who is serious about adding more activity to their lives. It's broken down into 20 minute segments and you can pick and choose to create your own workout each time or go with the predetermined workout. This DVD is very user-friendly and they way Bob encourges you through the workout you just want to keep going like the contestants ;)

Everyone has their own opinion so try the DVD for yourself - if you are serious about losing those pounds you will be happy you did! Happy Workout!!!",1137456000,6,1036,4.395833333333333

2437529,5,B000BQ7J70,"Okay fans of NBC's ""The Biggest Loser!"" Do you think you are up to the challenge that all those contestants on the hit television show had to endure from trainers Bob Harper and Jillian Michaels? Frankly, do YOU think you have what it takes to be ""The Biggest Loser"" in your own household? Then prepare to be challenged in a fun and exciting way with The Biggest Loser Workout DVD.

As someone who lost nearly 200 pounds, I am very well aware of the importance of a regular cardio workout program to weight management. Although my eating plan was the low-carb lifestyle, I still credit my daily visits to the YMCA as a major contributor to my weight loss success. That's why I wrote a whole chapter in my book ""Livin' La Vida Low-Carb"" about the incredible importance of exercise.

I am a HUGE FAN of ""The Biggest Loser"" and couldn't wait to get this DVDwith an Amazon.com gift certificate I received for Christmas. I eagerly popped it into my DVD player to see for myself what ""The Biggest Loser"" workout plan is all about.

After you hear an inspiring message from trainer Bob Harper (read my exclusive interview with him at LivinLaVidaLowCarb.com>, whose voice will push you during your workout, you can also see the dramatic transformation in the lives of both Matt, who was crowned the Season Two winner of ""The Biggest Loser,"" as well as Suzy, who was in the top three from Season Two. In addition, there is Season Two runner-up Seth and Andrea along with Season One contestants, Gary and Drea, who have done a great job keeping their weight off. These six ""real life"" people will show you that exercise can be fit into your life and can be fun, too.

The thing I like best about this workout video is that you can go at your own pace. There are varying levels of intensity and you can work your way up from the ""Low-Intensity"" workout all the way to the heart-pumping ""Boot Camp."" Whew, dog, this DVD is gonna work you! But if you are going to see results in your weight loss, then you will need to get your heart rate up and your body is gonna need to sweat. The Biggest Loser Workout DVDwill certainly do the trick.

I'm not usually a big fan of workout DVDs because they are sometimes too hokey in my book. But if you are a fan of the show or have a great need to do something about that pot belly, this may be a great motivating tool for you. Just as I have successfully lost weight along with these contestants from ""The Biggest Loser,"" so can YOU do it, too! Put in the effort and the results will be worth it in the end! You can count on it!

Be sure to pick up the companion book to ""The Biggest Loser,"" too!",1136937600,,2623,4.364754098360656
2437530,3,B000BQ7J70,"I guess the first thing I should mention is that I lost about 80 pounds a few years ago through circuit training (weights and cardio).  I decided to check this out both out of curiosity and also as a possible addition to my current workout schedule.  While I do think the show can be exploitive and send self-defeating messages to people (like being able to lose over 20 pounds in a week), it shows real people as they lose weight and that can be very inspirational.

I just watched the dvd for the first time yesterday and I have mixed feelings on it.  Personally, I don't like it but it really depends on what you want out of an exercise dvd.  Someone who's just starting out would prefer to see ""real"" people and that provides this.  A newer exerciser won't mind that you have three different people all exercising off cadence while a veteran, or someone who becomes fitter in time, would be thrown off by it and get confused at whom to watch.  The background music is way too quiet and it's also monotonous.  Again, something some will find important while others won't.  Personally, the workout itself is great, albeit high impact which I think was a mistake.  Some people on the show (and at home) will be either way too heavy or out of shape to do jumping jacks or other high impact moves.  They could become discouraged very quickly and need to learn of appropriate modifications BEFORE doing it first.  They could also just march in place if it becomes too tough.

In summary, I think that newer exercisers who struggle with motivation will really appreciate this workout.  It features people they saw on tv, has a personal trainer type of feel and helps them feel they're equal to the exercisers in the background.  Btw, I don't know if it was intentional but the people in the video are actually heavier than they ultimately turned out to be.  This is could be good visually for someone starting out but I think it would have been better for them to wait a little until they lost all or most of the weight.  Then, people could see evidence of how THEY could realistically look by doing the workout and implementing the dietary suggestions.  Even if you do end up outgrowing the video's drawbacks, if it gets your foot in the door to becoming a new you, it's certainly worth getting.",1136937600,27,2293,4.537712895377129
2437531,5,B000BQ7J70,"Like others have mentioned, this is the best workout video out there!  As a huge fan of the show (way to go Matt!!) I thought I just had to have this DVD.  Now I am glad I got it.  I have purchased other exercise videos in the past but found it hard to watch a group of size 3's bending this way and that.  This DVD is great because it has to me what I call ""real people"" who are not size 3's (yet) working out and sweating just like I was.  Bob is a great motivator and keeps you wanting to go on.  I even find myself laughing a little bit during it because of the comments Bob will make or something one of the cast members is doing.  None of the exercises are hard and it's great there are alternative ways to do certain exercises if you are limited in one way or another. I would have to say, BUY IT, you'll not like it, you'll LOVE IT!",1136937600,17,840,3.9058823529411764
2437532,5,B000BQ7J70,"I just recently bought this dvd after watching the show and seeing these folks have such great results.  You have to remember that the people on the show were under strict dietary and exercise control, and had their entire day to focus on these two essentials.  The regular joe doesn't always have that luxury, so I don't expect to lose tons of weight in 6 weeks......however, I do think this workout video is one of the best I've seen.  I have to say I have not seen the high impact cardio, but the low impact cardio, although it does have a jumping jack segment, offers alternative positions if you are not able to jump or bend, etc.  I enjoyed the fact that you did not have to be extremely coordinated or focus entirely on the ""steps"" to get a good workout.  One thing that I did like that the reviewer below did not, was that these ARE regular people who are struggling through their workout just like I am!!  It made it even easier seeing them want to quit, cause I did!  But they kept going, and so did I....like we accomplished something together.
