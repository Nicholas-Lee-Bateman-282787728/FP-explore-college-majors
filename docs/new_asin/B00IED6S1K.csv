8641565,4,B00IED6S1K,"I like the variety packs where there are lots of different characters. Some people seem to get upset when discs from the expensive sets are reprinted individually.

I like sets of certain things and others like this I like the ability to focus on individual cartoons like the disc of all Pepe le pew I have but might not want a whole disc of say Sylvester and tweety.

This one is starting off great. First one has granny tweety and Sylvester and second one is bugs and Yosemite Sam. Like I said some things i like a whole set of like all 6 original Star Wars and I like the individual discs from looney tunes that allow you to have variety and focus on one character or a variety of them or get the complete set if that's what you want.

The names of the cartoons are in a picture on top of the back of the DVD case. ",1493596800,,818,4.1257861635220126
