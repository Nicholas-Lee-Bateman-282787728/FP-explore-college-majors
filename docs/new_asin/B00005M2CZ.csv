1623902,5,B00005M2CZ,"Two wonderful classic episodes from the original Star Trek series.  McCoy delivers the unforgettable line ""he's worse than dead -- his BRAIN is missing.""  I can really relate to this episode as my brain has also been stolen not once but twice (neither time by aliens but by Trekkies pretending to be aliens, but that is another story).  Some really marvelous acting here, especially by the ever-wooden Nimoy on remote control through much of the episode.  All kidding aside, some of the best SF on American television.  The second episode is wonderful as well, with many twists and originality.",1006300800,9,594,4.959595959595959
1623903,3,B00005M2CZ,"Two very different episodes, which underscore the uneven quality of Star Trek's third season, are contained in Volume 31 of Paramount's complete Trek reissue.
Spock's Brain is generally acknowledged as the worst episode of Classic Trek ever.  Viewing it again confirms this.  The concept is inane, the plot medically and scientifically ridiculous, and the dialogue laughably bad.  About the only positive aspect of this episode was the installation of a rear projection screen on the bridge set, which allowed for new camera angles.  Parts of this episode were brilliantly lampooned on TV's The Wonder Years.  As with the episode And The Children Shall Lead, this story is best ignored or saved for gag viewing during a party.
Is There in Truth No Beauty? is the antithesis of Spock's Brain.  The story is intellectually engaging, and the dialogue at times borders on the poetic.  The plot deals with several interesting themes: how non-corporeal and corporeal life would ""relate"" to each other; love and rejection; beauty/ugliness; and the role of the handicapped in 23rd Century society.  The acting is some of the best ever seen on Trek.  Leonard Nimoy, in particular, shines during his mind-meld scene with the Medusan Kollos.  Diana Muldaur, who has a radiant yet wounded quality, is perfectly cast as Miranda Jones.  Some new visuals were created for this episode, and a rarely seen shot of the Enterprise from Trek's 1964 pilot The Cage is used briefly.
The sound restoration is excellent. The picture is mostly fine, except for a few instances of wear visible in Is There in Truth No Beauty.  This episode also contains a ""flipped"" shot of William Shatner, which has never been corrected.",1000080000,11,1696,5.061151079136691
1623904,4,B00005M2CZ,"If ever there was a choice slice from the cheese wheel that was the third season of 'Star Trek', the episode 'Spock's Brain' is it! Along with the Space Hippie eppie 'The Way To Eden', this particular (mis)adventure to recover our beloved half-Vulcan's grey matter is proof positive that even during its worst moments, classic 'Trek could still be pretty freakin' entertaining. McCoy's exaggerated expressions of uncertainty and trepidation whilst attempting the brain-restoration surgery is worth at least a rental to see!

Then of course there's 'Is There In Truth No Beauty?', featuring Mr. Spock goin' nutso after gazing on the hideously ugly Medusan Ambassador Kollos without the proper eye protection (you should've listened to the shop teacher, Spock)! It just figures, don't it? You just get your brain re-installed, and alla sudden you do something to get it thrown out of whack. Fortunately, the green-blooded logician makes a full recovery. Another testament to Spock's reputation as the Timex of 'Star Trek': he takes a lickin' and keeps on tickin'!

'... No Beauty?' also features actress Diana Muldaur's second guest appearance in Gene Roddenberry's little 23rd-century epic. She's one of only a handful of 'Trek thespian alums to play at least three different characters in this realm of cult TV sci-fi. Aside from this outing, there was her previous appearance as Dr. Ann Mulhall in 'Return to Tomorrow', and her subsequent one-year stint as Dr. Crusher's replacement aboard the NextGen Enterprise. Talk about rackin' up the frequent-flier miles!

7944781,4,B00005M2CZ,"Is There No Truth in Beauty: Gazing on the truth causes men to go insane?

In 'Spocks Brain' an alien, Kara (Marj Dusay), beams aboard the Enterprise, knocks out the crew, and steals Spocks brain! The search is on for Spock, the search for his brain anyway, as McCoy keeps his body alive with electronics.

Locating the alien's planet the crew beam down to investigate. The crew are quickly captured, and imprisoned by 'pain-belts'. All the men on the planet are imprisoned by 'pain-belts'. Women who rule this society, need these belts to keep men in line. Why didn't they think to bring along Uhuru... In fact, I think Uhuru does lead a team down for the rescue.

His brain's alive. They find and communicate with Spock - realizing his brain's been taken by these aliens in order that it can run their society. For example, Spock senses he's breathing, but he's only activating environmental controls. These women aren't very technologically advanced themselves. They're only using technology left over from olden times and the crew manage to escape and free Spock. McCoy uses their advanced technology to set things right, and this society is returned to it's 'normal' course.

This episode is known for being bad, however, this episode has many great Star Trek themes: showing disembodied consciousness, technology that can vastly speed up learning, and primitives who have access to advanced technology (either technology from their own past or alien technology {in one Trek episode, Errand of Mercy, they come across the 'Organians' who appear to be very primitive, only to find out at the end, they are extremely advanced. Their leader saying, ""While it's true, in time, you and the Klingons will become fast-friends..."" Spock observes, ""I should think the Organians are as far above us on the evolutionary scale - as we are above the Amoeba""}). Of course, the pain-belts, being needed to control the men is unique to this episode...

'Spocks Brain' is known as being the worst Star Trek episode, it's like the kid in class everyone picks on. Like the kid in class everyone picks on, is this one really that much different from the others?

It's no big deal to poke fun at this episode, I suppose it's fun. Even the biggest fans sometimes enjoy making fun of this or that about Star Trek. Is it a good thing to make fun of oneself? Sometimes I wonder whether it is or not...

Perhaps the criticism of this episode reveals more about the critic than it reveals about the episode. Perhaps, in the way bullying takes place in 'The Mysterious Stranger' by Mark Twain; kids pick on other kids because ultimately they are afraid of being picked on themselves.

Lets laugh at ourselves and not be afraid of being made fun of? Or, lets protect ourselves and others, and show real sympathy towards someone who is being made fun of? We all love to laugh. Why is it no one ever cries?",1170720000,,2880,4.769076305220883
7944782,2,B00005M2CZ,"If you are deciding which volumes to keep, you can safely consign this one to the dustbin and not miss a thing.  Granted the second episode is a lot better than the first but still relative to the other episodes in TOS-dom, it is still forgettable.  The other reviewers have done a good job of explaining why the first episode is brainless but the scriptwriting of the second episode is also subpar and while the plot is a little more interesting and believable, the overall episode still falls short of what we are used to from prior episodes.

OK, on to business.

Spock's Brain.  It's the corniest premise, with the corniest lines, with the worst acting.  If Star Trek has a reputation for bad acting, it's because of this episode.

Maybe it's the directing, not the acting.  Dammit Jim, I'm an engineer, not a TV producer.  But someone is to blame.

These are a few of my favorite things: Shatner trying to deliver the line, ""His...... brain???"" with due disbelief, while trying to hide his own disbelief in the silliness of the script.  McCoy waving his arms around exclaiming, ""Where are we going to go to look for Spock's Brain?"" looking as if he can't find the motivation for making such wild gesticulations.  The ""special effect"" where the camera shakes as they go down the elevator.  The unknown reason their pain bands knock them out in a few seconds the first time, but the second time they can stay conscious long enough to manipulate Spock's body with a remote control to make him push the button on the girl's bracelet.  How they managed to make the remote control -- with only four buttons -- control fine movements of Spock's left forefinger.  How Spock jumps off of the operating table as soon as McCoy sews up his skull.

On the other hand, the subterranean society is filled with slender, Presbyterian women wearing their thighs up to their miniskirts, which is still relevant 35 years later.  Only one picture of Sheila Leighton on all of Google.  Unfortunately it's only a bust shot, and I'm a leg man.

Ironically, it's episodes like this that may have led to the Star Trek craze, and ultimately the Movies.  Wasted talent during production of the TV show caused an overcompensation -- a yearning to see this great ensemble deliver more quality material, because in The Original Show, they occasionally didn't have any.

This episode is not camp.  This is an episode that is totally accessible to 11 year olds.

However, I don't have a clue about ""In Truth No Beauty,"" any more at 44 years old than when I was 11.  Maybe I should figure out the deeper symbolisms before passing judgment on this episode -- figuring out what the title means would be a good start.  Maybe if I watch it another hundred times.  No problem.

I was always annoyed that Diana Muldaur's costume didn't do justice at all to her [endless] beauty.  (Do I recall her hair was in a ""bun?"")  Maybe that was intentional, for a symbolic sort of reason.  As usual, her acting is Royal Shakespearian, even if I don't quite understand what her character's problem is.

Here's another historically interesting example of Star Trek innovations preceding 1960's technology.  Spock retreats to a cubicle to meld with Ambassador Kolos, and within a couple of decades, everyone's working in a cubicle.  Without Star Trek, there would be no Dilbert.  It's also interesting that Diana Muldaur's daughter, Maria (from Midnight at the Oasis) wrote the incidental music for this episode.

The rest of the Enterprise crew won't leave much of an impression in this episode, because they're all in the shadow of Nimoy's breakout, garrulous character, whom he gives a strong component of Sci-Fi.  It really belongs to Muldaur and Nimoy.

The directing is good, but the characterizations are a bit nebulous.  Characters are supposed to arrive at this point with strong emotions, but it's our homework assignment to fill in their implied histories.  The script provides a canvas with lots of room for the audience to go back and discuss such details, like an exercise in Philosophy, but I would have been more satisfied if they provided a little more ""on the surface.""

Lastly, I always thought those swirling colors at the southern edge of the galaxy were apropos for the Psychedelic 60s.  I wonder if I can program my computer to make my monitor do that.

A generous 2 stars for Spock's Brain (includes one star just for being a Trek), and 4 stars mostly for Nimoys' big scene in ""Beauty,"" for an average of 3.",1095120000,3,4031,4.759018759018759
7944785,1,B00005M2CZ,"While I agree that Spock's Brain is not the best effort of the third season, I would rather sit through this episode than ""Plato's Stepchildren"" or ""The Way to Eden"" or ""The Mark of Gideon"".  I think these three should have been scrapped before they were aired in 1968-69.
""Is There In Truth No Beauty"" has always been one of my favorite episodes since I was a kid.  It would be interesting to bring the Medusans back in a future episode to test their great navigational skills.  Lots of sequel potential here.",1048982400,3,510,4.521739130434782

After all, Star Trek is supposed to be amusing!  I will admit it's hard to think what the moral to this story would be, but it didn't detract from my enjoyment.  Also, I never get tired of hearing, ""I never should have re-connected his vocal chords"" (or was it mouth?) Guess it takes all kinds of Trekkers, or is it Trekkies?

7944787,4,B00005M2CZ,"Volume 31 of The Star Trek DVD Series includes two decent episodes from the haphazard third and final season of the show.
Indeed SPOCK'S BRAIN has become a punching bag for Star Trek critics over the years since it's airing in 1968.  I'll agree that it isn't one of the best Star Trek episodes out there but it receives way too much criticism.  Yes the episode is too out of this world to comprehend completely however it's still not a terrible epiosode.  The plot is entertaining as a race of Imorg humanoids steal Spock's brain.  You gotta give the cast credit for this one especially Leonard Nimoy who not only had to play a unemotional Vulcan for three years but also had to play an unemotional Vulcan without a brain!  This episode is actually quite nice despite it's constant criticism.  There is a delightful helping of eye candy as well with the women humanoids who steal Spock's brain.  They will bring ""delight"" to male viewers indeed!
IS THERE NO TRUTH IN BEAUTY is another average episode from Star Trek's third season.  Another episode that focuses on Spock.  A strangely dark yet compelling episode with a few thrilling twists and turns.  As the crew tries to transport the Medusan Ambassador (whose apparently so hideous that one look at him will drive a human insane) but end up being lost in space!  A nice guest star appearance by Diana Muldaur (who appeared perviously in RETURN TO TOMORROW in season 2)  Despite her appearance (as a different character then she was in season 2) IS THERE NO TRUTH IN BEAUTY remains an average episode at best.
Overall a nice DVD collection of decent episodes but there is notihng too special about this one.  Recommended!",1040688000,4,1674,4.711340206185567
