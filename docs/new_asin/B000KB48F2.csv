8325294,5,B000KB48F2,"This video is a must have for whoever wants to dance like a pro! This video is an excellent resource for the adult student interested in expanding their knowledge of dance movement in a meaningful way. It offers the chance to learn beautifully danceable combinations in the center while challenging the student with lots of controlled balances, change of directions and basic steps such as the waltz, which is done moving forward and back. I have tried to find such a resource on Amazon or You Tube for quite a while unsuccessfully. I could not find a video totally dedicated to Center exercises and combinations. While you can find a snippet of a combination or two, there is no DVD to include so many combinations in progression from more simple choreography and slower pace to a more complex and faster pace. The demonstrator, Glenn Keenan of The New York City Ballet executes every dance with precision and grace. Her use of arms and her supple upper body grant an elegance to her movement which becomes even more obvious as Finis draws her attention to certain nuances that could be improved, as movement articulation and phrasing. From the waltz to the petit pas de chat, fondu arabesque, and the petit echappe saute, the students pleasure increases with every combination, especially when each exercise builds upon the previous and is organically linked to what was taught before. Finis explains and demonstrates himself with his unparalleled elegance and clarity. This video has great impact for the student or ballet teacher and pleasant. A must have!
