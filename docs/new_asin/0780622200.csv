7789823,4,0780622200,"Thanks to a friend of mine finally cleaning out his garage, I was given a bunch of old VHS tapes including this one which was WCW's Slamboree '98. Bret Hart, after feuding against the nWo for months, helped Hollywood Hogan regain the WCW Championship from Randy Savage, before declaring his allegiance to him. The New World Order finally split into two different rival factions with nWo Hollywood (led by Hogan) & nWo Wolfpack (led by Kevin Nash) with the biggest shocker being that Giant had left WCW to rejoin Hogan's nWo after he had already signed to team with Sting to face The Outsiders.

WCW Television Champion Fit Finlay vs. Chris Benoit - Both men started off exchanging shoves before breaking down into some chain wrestling early on. Finlay focused on Benoit's neck & head with various clotheslines, headlocks, kneedrops & constantly pounding on the neck. Benoit picked up the intensity when he used a chair on the outside only for that to come back to haunt him when he did an attempted suicide dive out of the ring to the floor only for Finlay to nail him in the head with the chair. Booker T made an appearance here that caused Benoit to lose his focus with Finlay taking advantage of that & capitalizing on the head that he worked over the whole match to get the victory in a hard fought match.

Lex Luger vs. Brian Adams - Luger was out for revenge against Adams for his assist in attacking & injuring Rick Steiner weeks earlier but past the setup, this was pretty short & nothing noteworthy here.

Crusierweight Battle Royal - This match was to determine who would challenge Jericho for the Crusierweight Title right after with Jericho giving his own twist on ring announcing the participants. With this match being filled with crusierweights, there was more high flying than usual in his type of match but the ending was the real shocker as it was down to Juventud Guerrera & Ciclope when Juvi decided to eliminate himself in order to give Ciclope the win who then unmasked to reveal himself to be...

WCW Crusierweight Champion Chris Jericho vs. Dean Malenko - ...who attacked Jericho with more aggression & anger than we've ever seen from Malenko before. Malenko tossed Jericho around inside & outside the ring while dominating with Juventud in his corner cheering him on. Jericho was able to catch Malenko in a stun gun to get some offense in but he just couldn't stop Malenko's aggression as he delivered his top rope gutbuster & Texas Cloverleaf to get a measure of revenge against Jericho.

Bowery Death Match: Dallas Page vs. Raven - This design of this match was that DDP & Raven are locked inside a steel cage with a top on it that also contains a trash can full of weapons. with how personal issues got between these two, this was very aggressive with both men being rammed into the cage while the weapons heavily came into play here from a bullrope (which was used at one point to try to hang someone), VCR, cookie sheet, and a chair. The Flock got involved as they took out Raven's personal security before former Flock member Van Hammer appeared to even the odds. Kidman & Horace were still able to enter the cage to help out Raven resulting in DDP giving one of the most unique Diamond Cutters ever. Raven & DDP just beat each other to the point where one man was barely able to stand up to win the match...but keep watching after the match as someone from Raven's past came back to haunt him again.

Ultimo Dragon vs. Eddie Guerrero - Ultimo Dragon was wrestling for Chavo Guerrero's freedom from Eddie. This began very fast paced with both men trying to ground the other as Dragon did very impactful kicks while Eddie delivered snap suplexes & dropkicks before taking it to the floor & threw Dragon into the railing before choking him with a cable. Eddie was strattled on the top rope before Dragon kicked Eddie in the head off the ropes to the floor & delivering his trademark moonsault. Eddie continued to bring the offense by stealing Chavo's move in the tornado DDT while also countering the Dragon Sleeper into his own. Chavo got involved by trying to stop Eddie from cheating only for him to accidentally get hit by Ultimo that allowed Eddie to capitalize for the win. Stay turned after the match as Chavo realized that he lost his opportunity to be free only resulting in him finally cracking to the point where Eddie even tried to get him to calm down.

WCW United States Champion Goldberg vs. Saturn - This was scheduled to be a gauntlet match with Goldberg against Raven's Flock but Saturn earlier in the night revealed that he was no longer a member of the group & Saturn would only face Goldberg alone. Goldberg was dominate with power moves & takedowns resulting in Saturn taking the match to the floor & working over his shoulder by driving it into the post & delivering a dropkick from the apron to the shoulder. Saturn tried to ground Goldberg put he kept powering out resulting in him bringing in a chair & able to execute a springboard dropkick off the chair once but unfortunately he was caught the second time leading to the spear & jackhammer for another number added onto ""the streak.""

Right around here was the ""match"" between Eric Bischoff & Vince McMahon based off Eric challenging Vince earlier in the week but it was really nothing more than an ego stroke by Bischoff as Vince already stated that he wouldn't be appearing at the event but Eric went ahead with this anyways.

Randy Savage vs. Bret Hart w/Roddy Piper as the Special Referee - Bret tried to stall in the beginning by constantly hanging out on the floor before Piper forced Bret into the ring. With both men having issues with Piper, they did shove him only for Piper to shove back. This got aggressive with Bret trying to slam the ringside steps onto Savage before Savage countered them & threw him into it instead. Bret switched focus to Savage's injured leg to the point where he was hobbling on one leg & when Savage later delivered his trademark elbow drop, he hurt his own leg in the process. Hart was able to apply the sharpshooter but Savage was able to not only power out of it but applied his own. Elizabeth showed up for the first time in a month to distract Piper allowing Bret to knockout Piper & Hogan appearing to let Bret Hart get the tainted win.

WCW Tag Team Champions Outsiders vs. Sting & Giant - This was Hall's first appearance since the Uncensored PPV while the tension between Sting & Giant was clear from the start. Hall stared out against Sting & delivered the chokeslam early to send a message to Giant but that only angered Sting who intensely worked over Hall. Nash & Hall were the undeniable fan favorites as the ""Wolfpack"" chants were loud while they worked over Sting to keep Giant out of the match before he got the tag & did Hogan's trademark legdrop onto Nash. Things really started breaking down when Nash went for the powerbomb on Giant only for Hall to grab the tag team championship & nail Nash with it allowing Giant to win the match showing that Hall was a member of Hogan's nWo leaving Sting in stunned silence as he was now tag champion with Giant & had a decision to make on joining him in Hogan's nWo as well.

This event had it's share of quality matches as the only real dud here was Luger/Adams as all the other matches delivered while also having it's share of plot twist & turns making this an event I would see.",1306713600,,7433,4.560299625468165
7789824,4,0780622200,"This is one of those events that doesn't get mentioned much when it comes to WCW but I was able to get a friend's copy so I was able to check it out myself. There was a lot going in this time as the main storyline was the constant feud between the duelling nWo factions of nWo ""Hollywood"" & nWo ""WolfPac"" with the main event being surrounded in mayhem. Originally, it was scheduled to be a WCW Tag Team Championship match between the leaders of the ""WolfPac"" in The Outsiders (Kevin Nash & the returning Scott Hall) against WCW representatives Sting & The Giant. However on the previous Nitro, The Giant turned over to the nWo ""Black & White"", vowing that he would be Sting's partner but also stated that Sting needed to make a decision if they won the titles. Will Sting join the Giant or will he stay loyal to WCW? The other big main event centered on two legends as fellow ""WolfPac"" member Randy Savage looked to get revenge on the newest member of the nWo ""Black & White"" Bret Hart (?). However with all the tension between these two, nobody wanted to referee this one so the man standing up would be the ""Rowdiest of them all"", WCW Commissioner Rowdy Roddy Piper. As if that wasn't enough, three days prior on Thunder Eric Bischoff put out an open challenge to Vince McMahon to compete on this card with even going far to have security wait for Vince...as if he was going to show up.

WCW Television Champion Fit Finlay vs Chris Benoit. These two were in the middle of a feud involving Booker T but due to Benoit's victory on Nitro, he got the title shot here. This match started out with both men trying to ground the other with various submissions holds with both men delivering stiff slams including a variations of suplexes. Both men even used a chair in the end with one moment to check out would be Benoit's suicide dive through the ropes right into a chair that would become a popular spot in his WWE career. Booker T would make an appearance before Finlay took advantage of one mistake from Benoit in what was a great mat-wrestling opener that is sure to bless fans of ""professional wrestling"" not ""sports entertainment"".

Lex Luger vs Bryan Adams. Luger had stepped up to this challenge of behalf of Rick Steiner after Rick was set up & attacked by Adams & Scott Steiner the previous week on Nitro. Luger was aggressive & worked on Adams's shoulder constantly with Adams getting the advantage due to help from Vincent & even using some power moves but it wasn't to be as Luger got the win & revenge for Steiner in this short average match.

Cruiserweight Battle Royal. The winner of this match would get a shot at Chris Jericho's Cruiserweight Championship immediately following the match but before the match got started, Jericho continued to deliver on his comedic side in which he actually introduced all of the participants of this battle royal the only way that Jericho can. This was the typical battle royal in which there was so much action going on that you couldn't keep up with all of the action but there were some moments such as the interaction between Juventud Guerrera & Psichosis, Johnny Swinger being the first one eliminated, the return of Marty Jannetty but the real highlight was the final two that got such a loud reaction from the crowd as Juventud eliminated himself leaving Cyclope as the last man standing revealing himself to be...

WCW Cruiserweight Champion Chris Jericho vs ???....Dean Malenko who hadn't been seen for months but was constantly under the verbage of Jericho for weeks. Malenko broke from his ""Iceman"" character as he showed more emotion in this match than he is usually known for as you could see that he just wanted to hurt Jericho more than getting the victory with Juventud being the supporter for Malenko on the outside. This didn't go too long since Malenko had just wrestled through a battle royal but within in that time, they went back & forth with Malenko not only getting his revenge but also the title.

Bowery Death Cage Match: Diamond Dallas Page vs Raven. The rules of this match would be that both men would be locked inside a cage with a roof on top similiar to a Hell In A Cell with weapons inside the cage as the rules of the match would be similiar to a Last Man Standing match in which you had to beat your opponent down for the 10 count. This resembled their previous match at Spring Stampede as they beat the hell out of each with various weapons such as steel chairs, a bull rope, a VCR (you read that right) amongst others with members of the Flock & ex-members getting involved in the match with Raven even using DDP's finishing move on him as well. DDP overcame the odds here & got his revenge but the bigger story was what happened after the match that had a disgruntled wrestler take his frustrations out on Raven & his flock for not being accepted into the group.

Eddie Guerrero vs Ultimo Dragon. The story behind this match was that due to a previous match stipulation a few months back, Chavo Guerrero was forced to be Eddie's slave & even had to come to the ring wearing a ""Eddie Guerrero is my favorite wrestler"" shirt so the stipulation here was that if the Dragon won, then Chavo would be free. Guerrero & Dragon have always had good matches together & this was one of them but what hurt the match was that due to that stipulation, there was more of a focus on Chavo & what he was going to do then focusing on the actual match going on even to the point to where the announcers were just talking about the angle instead of the match.

WCW United States Champion Goldberg vs Saturn. This was scheduled to be a Gauntlet match but Saturn refused that stipulation or any help from the flock as he wanted to beat Goldberg on his own. Goldberg was still early in his WCW run but Saturn was one of those people that was able to bring out the best in Goldberg & just like their previous Spring Stampede match, that was the case here. Saturn used a different strategy here in which he wasn't just bringing the fight to Goldberg but kept breaking his momentum whenever Goldberg got in control. Saturn even used a chair & put on a hell of a performance but it wasn't enough as Goldberg continued his undefeated streak here.

Eric Bischoff vs ""Vince McMahon"". The question marks are there because even though Vince never accepted (or acknowledged) this challenge yet just for his ego, Bischoff went through as if the match was still going to happen...which it didn't & resulted in Bischoff giving himself the win by no-show. Pointless & unnecessary.

Bret Hart vs Randy Savage w/Roddy Piper as the guest referee. Due to the series of events in the past month, this was a dream match that ironcially was taking place for the first time ever....in WCW (they did wrestle in the WWF). Bret was stalling early before Piper threw Bret into the ring to start the match which resulted in both men brawling around the crowd before getting back into the ring. Savage was working with a torn ACL & a brace on his knee which Bret heavily worked on throughout the match with even teasing a fight with Piper on a number of occasions. Miss Elizabeth would make an appearance here before it was an object that Bret took out that ended up playing a factor in the match along with the interference from Hollywood Hogan but past that, this was a good match considering that Savage wasn't healthy going into this one.

WCW Tag Team Champions The Outsiders vs Sting & The Giant. Before the match, Scott Hall had made his return for the first time in months leading to a huge pop given to him by the audience. The big story here was what would Sting's decision be during or after the match as Giant (being an nWo member) promised to be loyal to Sting to win the titles but wanted Sting to make a decision when they won the titles. This was a good main event match as everyone played to their strengths but the highlight here was when Dusty Rhodes got involved that lead to Scott Hall doing something that nobody expected including Sting that would make you rethink about how this whole angle would followed up.

Overall, the only things that I didn't like from this event was the whole Bischoff/""McMahon"" angle that went throughout the night to the point that the action was being overshadowed by that while the actual in-ring action for the most part was solid with some shocking twists & turns to certain angles. I would recommend as this was one of WCW's best events from 1998 (and there weren't alot of them during this time).",1301702400,,8491,4.517891997397528
