The background music, while individuals are interviewed, is as loud as the interviewee speaking.  There is no CC either.",1514678400,,293,5.0625

My husband and I own Pi Graphics and did the t-shirts for the release party at the ""Dexter Lake Club"" where Otis Day performed for us. Its the people who are the story and I absolutely loved Animal House and the House of Blues shares a lot of behind the scenes shenanigans.  Pure fun and pure joy!  Thank you Katherine Wilson and team for this blast to the past with so much history about a movie that has been a BIG part of my life living here in Eugene Oregon!",1416355200,,534,4.115384615384615

I read Fat, Drunk, and Stupid by Matty Simons over my vacation and was a little unsatisfied with the lack of detailed stories regarding the filming in and around Eugene. Animal House of Blues more than made up for that.

If your an Animal House fan or just love film making this is a no brainer, for $14 how can you go wrong?",1409788800,,337,4.184615384615385
8654221,5,B00JWS9H7I,"There is no shortage of documentaries about the making of Animal House, arguably the most influential college comedy ever made. But unlike the standard insider-based production documentary found on the Animal House DVD bonus-disc, which focuses exclusively on the film's writers, director, producer, and stars, this gem of a documentary by Oregon-based producer Katherine Wilson (who served as location scout and locals casting director for Animal House, Stand by Me, and other films), tells a much deeper, and arguably more important story. Animal House of Blues blends the stories behind two landmark films - Animal House and The Blues Brothers - by focusing on the impact of community members in Eugene, Oregon and surrounding towns on the making of and inspiration behind these film.

In addition to information about the circumstances that brought to the iconic film to Eugene and the University of Oregon, the heart of the film centers around two local legends who made unusual contributions to both Animal House and The Blues Brothers. The first of these legends is writer Ken Kesey (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest). The film argues that Kesey and his band of Merry Pranksters, icons of the 1960s counter-culture, were the inspiration behind the boys of Delta house. Of course, due to broader changes in American culture the Animal House writers decided to shift the Delta boys intoxicant of choice from LSD to alcohol. The story of John Belushi's meeting with Kesey while the SNL star was in Eugene filming Animal House, is one of the best moments in the documentary. The second of these legends is blues musician Curtis Salgado (winner of Entertainer of the Year at the 2013 Blues Music Awards). Salgado was a young blues singer in Eugene and his iconic look inspired Belushi to create The Blues Brothers. Yet never before has the full story behind that relationship been told. The interview with Salgado delivers on a number of levels.

Despite it's relatively short running time (less than an hour), Animal House of Blues thoughtfully integrates a number of untold stories while reminding us that Hollywood blockbusters, at least those that stand the test of time, involve a far greater number of people than we often realize and that those people often have stories that are far more interesting than those told by the studio. From interviews with actors and extras like Maida Belove, Kim Plant, Howard Farling, Dennis Cozzalio, and Bruce Lundy and interviews with Wilson and others involved in the film's production, to the stellar narration by our guide through the story, Izzy Whetstine (who played the hilarious janitor in Animal House), this intriguing documentary succeeds in reminding us that it takes a village to make a film classic.

Stephen Rust served as an Academic Consultant on this film.",1409184000,3,2816,5.077753779697624
8654222,5,B00JWS9H7I,"Behind every great movie and the stars who get all the credit are the people who sweat not under the lights, but while setting them up and making sure they turn on. ANIMAL HOUSE OF BLUES tells their story and it is a compelling one. With interviews filmed near the actual ANIMAL HOUSE locations in Eugene, Oregon, blues legend Curtis Salgado, local casting directors, extras and members of Ken Kesey's Pranksters get the chance to tell the story of their influence on the iconic college comedy, as well as THE BLUES BROTHERS a few years later.

The film traces ANIMAL HOUSE's origins back to Kesey and his wild acid-fueled bus trips across America and his influence on the writers of the film, through the ANIMAL HOUSE crew's wild parties amongst Eugene's blues scene in the 1970's all the way to the present as hundreds of toga clad locals march through the streets of Cottage Grove, Oregon celebrating the chaotic fraternity that rampaged the same streets in the film. Possibly the most exciting part of the documentary comes with the stories of Salgado and his friendship with John Belushi. Belushi would later credit Salgado with influencing the Blues Brothers, and the film features unreleased live tracks of Belushi singing two future Blues Brothers standards with Salgado at the Eugene Hotel. Fans of Saturday NIGHT LIVE and the late Belushi will not want to miss out on hearing these!

ANIMAL HOUSE OF BLUES is a concise and heartfelt portrait of a community coming together to help make a comedy classic or two. In turn, these films have come to define the communities that made them. The locals who helped make these films are finally able to tell their stories and get the credit they deserve as well as pay tribute to the films that gave them so much. Listen to them. They have a lot to say.",1409184000,5,1803,4.720634920634921

I told my grandparents the main reason I wanted to attend The University of Oregon was because of the journalism school, but really there were two reasons... ""Animal House"" is easily the most influential college film of all time, both in cinema and in reality. No film can match its tenacious grasp on college culture from both back then and today. ""Animal House"" has just as much influence in crafting the college social experience as did the Greeks and the red Solo cup.

But beyond the mangled bed sheet-turned toga exists countless tales of Eugene's influence on the film and the film's influence on Eugene. This small Oregon community banded together and did ""whatever it took"" to help produce the film and the result is a renowned classic.

The stories on the stars and that exhausting search for the right school have been said enough times that it's like beating a dead horse in Dean Wormer's office, but this documentary focuses on those who are just like every other student or local musician or small time filmmaker-- because these are exactly the type of people who helped make the film!

What began with a simple visit to a UO film class ended with the completion of a dream and each person who worked on ""Animal House of Blues"" did so with the spirit of cinema, community and care.

Bravo!",1409184000,6,1345,4.682203389830509
