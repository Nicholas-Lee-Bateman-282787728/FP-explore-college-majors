8032827,5,B0002VERTC,Terrific series.,1454112000,,16,7.5
8032828,1,B0002VERTC,"It's a shame there is not a rating below one star.  This is the most embarrassing piece of garbage I have ever seen for sale.  Their attempt at humor gave me douche chills.  I can't believe that no one in the production process of this video realized what a pile of crap it is.  If you're thinking of purchasing this video, save yourself some time and just throw your money out the window.
UPDATE: Buy ""Accounting in an Hour"" DVD instead.",1291075200,,438,4.37037037037037
8032829,1,B0002VERTC,"This DVD series is so disappointed. I could not believe my eyes when I put this piece of garbage in my DVD player. It's a very annoying DVD. It's almost $30 and it's only 26 minutes.

They try to make the subject funny, but with only 26 minutes of run time there is not much teaching just comedy. The beginning is very annoying, you can't skip it and there is no menu.

It looks like a DVD my grandma would create and she is 85 years old. Horrible, horrible DVD.

The only good thing....I'll get back to you when I find one.",1183075200,10,524,4.117647058823529
