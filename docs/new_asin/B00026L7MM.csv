8022828,4,B00026L7MM,I enjoyed this film and the storyline . If you are a foreign film advocate this one is a good one to see.,1356912000,3,105,3.608695652173913
8022829,3,B00026L7MM,"This movie was just okay and very hard to follow.  I do like some French movies, but not too wild about this one.",1353715200,,113,3.9130434782608696
8022830,2,B00026L7MM,"My husband and I began watching this film and then stopped because we found it very disturbing. The repetitive theme of sexual predation and the threat of rape, by a gang of young thugs, of a teacher and then of the young girl Victorine was unsettling. We couldn't see where the film was going and decided that we didn't want to come along for the ride and find out.

The juggling of time, space and themes was well-executed and I could recognize that the film was creative and original, but the level of tension was too high. We may try it again at some other time, when our expectations are more in line with what we're going to see, but nothing I had read about the film offered any warning about the nature of the subject matter. I had assumed that the story would be similar to Le Grain et le Mulet, a film we enjoyed. The reviews did not suggest the bizarre and unpleasant quality of at least the first thirty minutes of the movie, which is all we saw.

Perhaps we have both worked with too many antisocial people in our professions to enjoy the depiction of them on the screen.",1247875200,4,1084,4.334975369458128
8022831,5,B00026L7MM,"I think this is one of the most sublime stories ever told in French cinema. The borderline madness and chaos, the loyalty and love of a father and his daughter, can't be told with more compassion and understanding than as it is told in this sublime work of art.",1242172800,,261,4.346938775510204
8022832,5,B00026L7MM,"I have only seen 3 Bertrand Blier movies, but this one is easily my favorite of the 3.  BUFFET FROID, starring Gerard Depardieu, was the first I saw -- and the fact that it was basically plotless and full of absurdist humor made it instantly a favored flick.  I more recently saw Blier's Oscar-winning GET OUT YOUR HANDKERCHIEFS but thought it was a little too conventional and strained next to the more flat-out freewheeling BUFFET.

About 15 years after that pair of movies comes this one, which marries the sensibilities of the other two perfectly.  Like HANDKERCHIEFS, it actually has a story, but like BUFFET, it doesn't bother with real-world logic, good taste, or linear chronology in telling that story.

SOLEIL is sort of a movie about coming-of-age in the projects, sort of a movie about sexual psychology, and sort of a cut-and-pasted collage of unusual moments.

The magical thing is that the damn thing winds up more moving than it probably would have if it was a straightforward tearjerker about hard living.  Of course, Blier can't be credited completely for this, as his actors are wonderful, especially Anouk Grinberg as Victorine, our perpetually childish heroine, and Marcello Mastroianni as her charming perpetually drunk papa.

An underseen gem.",1118361600,14,1266,5.052884615384615
