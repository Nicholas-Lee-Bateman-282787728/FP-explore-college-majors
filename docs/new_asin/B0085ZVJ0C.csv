8525811,4,B0085ZVJ0C,"DVD Review: A 2 Disc movie set featuring Frank Shum And Jack Conn Two Crippled Heroes and Fighting Life. Both movies are in full-screen with descent picture quality. This set also comes with to short films I didn't see.

Movie Review: Two Crippled Heroes: This is an excellent sequel to Crippled Masters. I can almost say it's just as good with great fight scenes and a descent plot. And a monkey gets brutally murdered. YEEEESH!

Fighting Life: Don't expect a kung fu movie because it is not. THOUGH it does have some fight scenes, this movie is more so a drama than a martial arts film about two cripples fighting oppression and trying to gain acceptance in a bullying and bigoted society. Well, this movie sucked. I wanted a crippled kung fu movie with death and revenge but instead I get a bunch of whinny dingleberries. BOOOOOOOOOOOOO! F*** THIS MOVIE!

Conclusion: 3 1/2 stars for the DVD's 4 1/2 for Two Crippled Heroes and 1 star for Fighting Life.",1429056000,,956,4.644970414201183
