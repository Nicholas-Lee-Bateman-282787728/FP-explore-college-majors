2884398,4,B000SFJ4K4,"An okay film about survival on a then unknown and strange alien world.  It wasn't the most exciting movie on TV, but when it would come on I would tune in as a kid (scifi films being rare to air on television, unlike today's video on demand culture).  It wasn't action fare with lots of space battles and adventures slugging it out with ray guns and what not, but it was a decent enough film for what it was.

I'll get this out of the way right here and now, over on the old IMDB forums there was mention that this film was more than just an average ""bromance"" with a wink and a nod.  Eh, sure, if that's what you see.  To me this is just that slow moving space adventure film about two guys trying to survive.  If you want to read more into it, then that's your business, but I think I can safely say that it's just another space adventure.

One of the really cool things about the film is that it is slow paced, has kind of a warmth to it both visually and in the story.  And the visuals, to me at least, and again this is the boy adventurer in me talking, are pretty cool.  Not a lot was known about mars, so there's a lot of red and pastel colors used here, along with some pretty cool matte work for the shots of the Martian skies.  To me those are the most memorable things.

I think all in all it's just kind of  a cool film.  It's not my favorite, but I like it for what it is.  I think the director mentions that he regrets using the models from War of the Worlds for this film, and admittedly that's always something that's kind of nagged at me a little since I first saw this film all those decades ago.  But, whatever.  I guess they had to save money somehow, so they recycled the models with some modifications.

Overall it's just a decent pic.  Whether you read any social message in it, subversive or not, or just view it like I do as a boyhood nostalgia blast, it should entertain.  Just remember, it's a scifi film from the 1960s, and maybe that's the best way to sit down and watch it.

Give it a shot.",1518652800,,2020,4.091603053435114

2884414,5,B000SFJ4K4,"I saw this movie when it first came out at the theaters.  I loved it then and I still like it.  I love books and movies about how to survive and ingenuity.  This movie has it all.  It is one man, literally, against the cosmos.  He is accompanied by a small monkey, and that monkey helps him survive in an extremely hostile environment.  There is much in this movie that can be seen to be parallel to the origin story ""Robinson Crusoe"" and like the origin story there is a ""man Friday.""  How these two survive is fascinating.  In addition the scenery is so fabulous that you can almost imagine that you really are seeing a movie filmed on Mars.  I don't know how many times I have watched this movie but each and every time I am filled with the same sense of wonder and appreciation for the movie.

This movie is so much better than the ""reality"" movies made about Mars.  They are good, too.  But they remove all the wonder and replace it with ""OK, we have to survive, grow potatoes.""  And since the latest movies are ONLY about survival there is NO exploration or what might or might not be around the corner.

RCoM not only is about survival but about exploration and what will we find?",1493251200,7,1187,4.3122171945701355

2884432,5,B000SFJ4K4,"Just finished watching ""Robinson Crusoe On Mars"" released by Paramount Pictures.
Prior to buying this DVD during a special 60% off sale at the nearby Barnes & Noble Book Store, I had never seen ""Robinson Crusoe On Mars"" on television before.  A bit odd, considering how much a classic science fiction movie fan I am [as Jeff H., Zack, and Barry will attest too.]
On an manned orbital mission to map Martian gravity, U.S. Astronaut Kit Draper and his fellow astronaut are forced to eject from their spacecraft when after dodging an orbiting fireball puts them on a collision course with the Martian surface.
While it's important to note that the idea of someone actually surviving on the Martian surface nowadays may make this movie seem a bit dated and quaint, ""Robinson Crusoe On Mars"" was in fact the equivalent of ""The Martian"" today.  Utilizing the best scientific speculations of the time, ""Robinson Crusoe On Mars,"" is an engrossing and provocative story of one man's survival on a planet that seems determined to kill him off one way or the other>
Draper is able to figure out how to survive, and how to generate much needed oxygen.  The only other survivor of the crash, a monkey named Mona, provides Draper with several clues on the location of food and water.
What makes ""Robinson Crusoe on Mars"" also intriguing is perhaps the intended and/or unintended homo-eroticism is several scenes.  From a distance, viewers are treated to a prolonged glimpse of a nude Draper as he goes swimming in a Martian pool.
There is also the strategic position of Draper and the male alien slave he names Friday in a stated homage to the original novel, when the first meet when Friday escapes alien slavers.  Don't hate me Star Gate fans, but there are some elements of ""Robinson Crusoe On Mars"" that were probably lifted and retooled for the Star Gate universe - like colonies of humans across the stars used as slaves.
Friday has the means of keeping Draper alive with a medical pill that helps humans breath in the Martian atmosphere for prolonged periods of time.
There is also one scene where Friday loving carries an unconscious Draper in his arms and it marks a change in the relationship between them - instead of master and servant, Draper and Friday become close friends who work together for their mutual survival.
What makes ""Robinson Crusoe On Mars"" of special interest is that a unique alien dialect - Vargorian - was created and actually spoken in the movie.
A Great Science Fiction Classic!
Five Stars!",1473033600,,2511,4.789838337182448

2884435,5,B000SFJ4K4,"I strongly suspect that this Blu-Ray version of Robinson Crusoe on Mars looks and sounds as good as is possible, given the source material.  The picture quality is less than ideal, being a bit grainy, so I'd give the picture quality a B.  According to the notes within the Blu-Ray package, the experts at The Criterion Collection did much to improve both the picture quality and the sound quality of this film.  The sound quality is surprisingly crisp and clear.  I believe the experts at The Criterion Collection did a wonderful job of making Robinson Crusoe on Mars look and sound as good as it does, considering the source material they apparently had to work with---and the source material was likely the best available.

In the early 2000s, I tried to sell a spec screenplay to Hollywood, and not knowing any better, I referenced ""Robinson Crusoe on Mars"" in my logline. (Logline---a SHORT pitch for your screenplay)  Anyway, I mailed a letter to the late and honorable Mr. Paul Mantee (1931-2013) and told him about the ""Robinson Crusoe on Mars"" logline-reference for my spec screenplay ... and he was kind enough to reply to my letter!

All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) may be the greatest movie I've ever seen, but Robinson Crusoe on Mars (1964) is my all-time favorite movie.  So when you notice that I've rated this movie five stars, please understand that I am completely biased in favor of this movie.",1467158400,4,1418,4.759183673469388
2884436,5,B000SFJ4K4,"Very good 60's sci-fi epic.  A party of two astronauts head for Mars.  Only one survives a crash landing.  Also surviving is the expedition's Wooly Monkey.  Why a monkey is brought along I'm never quite clear on, but she serves a useful purpose in the survival of our hero.  He eventually saves the life of a human alien, a slave of a ruthless race of different human aliens.  Together they try to evade said slavers and keep alive on Mars's inhospitable terrain.  Good performances and the Death Valley locales (with 60's special effects and photo-shopping) are excellent and fill in nicely for Mars.  Some of the science may or may not be accurate (probably inaccurate) but they are believable for a fiction film.  The Criterion Collection DVD is excellent quality and has some nice extras, including the trailer.  Highly recommended.",1466208000,,836,4.9071428571428575

The movie was how I remembered it - just great. If you want to want to picky there are a few flaws in the story but who cares it was made in 1964. The special effects still stand up today.

Well, I exaggerate, there are in facts rocks on mars, and there are poles, and a tropical earth monkey can live without an environmental suit in forty to hundred degree below freezing temperatures while breathing the thin air of mars, but other than that the rest of the science is awful.

2884529,4,B000SFJ4K4,"Dated, but fun movie mostly with just 1 character (2 if you count the monkey).  We know Mars isn't really like this, but just pretend it takes place on a planet in another solar system.  Paul Mantee, a busy tv actor, works hard carrying almost all the dialog as marooned astronaut Christopher Draper, our Robinson Crusoe.  There's some humor, mostly revolving aroung Mona, the monkey.  Eventually our hero finds another person, an alien slave that he rescues from the mysterious alien miners.  He is Draper's ""Friday"" ala the original Robinson Crusoe story.  Even now, this movie is fun to watch and all 3 characters are likable and we can root for them.  Too many sci fi movies now have too many unlikable characters that are there mostly to be killed off.  Oh and Adam West is briefly seen as the other pilot who (SPOILER)....  dies early on.  ""Friday"" is played by a guy named Victor Lundin, another prolific tv actor who played the first credited Klingon on the original Star Trek episode, ""Errand of Mercy"".

2884535,5,B000SFJ4K4,"This is no doubt the finest sci-fi film that you've never seen.  For sci-fi fans, it is an absolute must have and it's to Amazon's credit that they have it.
The film was amazingly well made and believable.  It was thought years ago that Mars was simply a pretty cold and pretty dry place; it wasn't known until the Viking Landers[after the film] that Mars was incredibly frigid most of the time and much drier than a bone away from the icecaps.

The plot centered around the astronaut(Paul Mantee) who is left to fend for himself after a mission to Mars.  He finds a companion on the planet, as unlikely as that might be.  The companion is an escaped slave from an alien mining expedition who seeks asylum with our hero...and finds it.

Then they establish a crude 'habitat' that will allow them to survive until a rescue mission can reach them.  Though there isn't much 'action' at all for a sci-fi film, you will be rooting for their survival and will have rapt attention until a rescue ship arrives, or fails to arrive, in time.
Yes, the director and screen play used poetic license to inject the Martian scenes with things that are undoubtedly not possible, like humans existing in the open, pools of water(it would instantly freeze or boil), etc.  It was all to tell the story, so we can give them a pass...",1418688000,2,1312,4.529661016949152

Due to a mishap Mars Gravity Probe One was captured in Mars' gravity and they had to abandon ship. Ao it looks like Kit (Paul Mantee) and Mona (The Woolly Monkey) are left to their own devices alone on Mars.

Will Kit find a way to survive and maybe something he (or we) did not suspect?

It is fun to look at all the 1960's technology (now 50 plus years old.) Oh no, I saw this in the movies; I guess my technology is a tad older. They may have also borrowed some scenes from The War of the Worlds (1953.) The fireball at the beginning of the movie came from the film ""Conquest of Space"" (1955.) we also see ""Destination Moon"" (1950) space suits.

Filming Locations: Death Valley National Park, California, USA

I cannot believe that they gave it both the Criterion treatment and the Blu-ray treatment as it is just another 60's sci-fi.

Anyway there is no excuse to miss this one.

-----
I watched the Criterion Blu-ray version with commentary. According to the commentary the monkey's name was Barney. They made a fur bikini so his male accoutrements would not show.",1403740800,3,1134,4.529411764705882

I was very pleasantly surprised!  And as a senior, I still enjoyed it!  The story line is imaginative and the acting is fine, by my standards.  So, pop some popcorn, put up your feet and enjoy a trip to the old time Sci-fi.",1403740800,,379,3.9342105263157894
2884576,5,B000SFJ4K4,"This is a superb Sci-Fi movie with an unfortunate title. Even the cover makes me cringe: a monkey in a space suit. But the acting and story line were great, and the special effects were good even by modern standards. I couldn't believe the incredible landscapes with no vegetation...then I saw it was filmed in Death Valley.

My two boys...twins aged 10...are Star Wars fans. They watched it with me one evening, mesmerized. At the end they admitted it was better than any Star Wars movie they had seen.

I'd have to agree.",1403395200,,523,4.612903225806452
2884577,4,B000SFJ4K4,The epitome of campy science fiction this is one of the greatest movie of the genre.  Great adventure mixed with surprising acting and special effects.  Delivered flawlessly through Amazon Prime and my Kindle.,1403136000,,209,5.303030303030303
2884578,5,B000SFJ4K4,I am still impressed with the story even though the special effects are kind of dated.  Great movie.  You'll like it.,1402963200,,117,4.523809523809524
2884579,5,B000SFJ4K4,"The book ""Robinson Crusoe"" was written by Daniel Defoe back in 1719. Certainly one of the great literary classics it has a few times since the birth of moving pictures been told on celluloid. By far the most unique version to be made has to be ""Robinson Crusoe On Mars"". Starring Paul Mantee as astronaut ""Kit"" Draper who along with his co-astronaut, played by Adam West of future ""Batman"" fame and only appears briefly in this movie, and a ""woolly"" monkey crash land on Mars. Separated during the ejection from the capsule Draper eventually finds his partner didn't survive the landing. So now Draper is stranded on Mars but at least not alone as the monkey survived but now just as in a classic novel Kit Draper has to figure out how to stay alive on this deserted island called Mars. If you are familiar with the story of ""Robinson Crusoe"" you will find the plot in this version is pretty much the same just a different location. Draper evens ends up making friends with one of the aliens on the planet, played by Victor Lundin, who becomes his Friday.

While I had heard of the movie it was only recently I had the chance to see it. Made in 1964 this is pretty good science-fiction for a movie 50 years old at the time of this writing. Yes by todays standards the special effects are outdated and could be considered cheesy but if you look past all that and just allow yourself to get involved in the characters and the story you will find as I did this is really a pretty good little movie. What really makes the movie work is the acting. Paul Mantee and later on Victor Lundin when he appears in the story gives strong performances. A good bulk of the movie is just Mantee trying to figure out how to survive in a hostile environment. With no one to talk to but the woolly monkey and a tape recorder to keep a record of his time on the planet Mantee gives a believable performance of a man trying to brave the elements. The one problem he can't get past is the loneliness. After all a monkey can only provide so much friendship. Enter Lundin as ""Friday"". Draper saves his life after a group of aliens in spaceships attack and try to eliminate ""Friday's"" people. Once they can get past the communication barrier a true friendship developes.

If you like the sci-fi movies from the '50s and '60s then this is one you have to add to your video collection. I definitely consider ""Robinson Crusoe On Mars"" one of the better movies sci-fi movies from that era. Right up there with ""Forbidden Planet"" and ""War Of The Worlds"", which by chance was directed by Byron Haskin who also directed ""Robinson Crusoe On Mars""! Just like the book this movie is a classic.",1402963200,,2658,4.455852156057495
2884580,5,B000SFJ4K4,"No spoolers here.  It is widescreen with what appears to be restored color and focus.

This is a great movie and suitable for kids.  Some very mild vioence.  Astronauts, survival techniques on a different planet, aliens( not too scary for kids) , good special effects, and decent plot.

It is a bit slow at times.  But not as slow as the movie Cast Away starring Tom Hamks.  But plot is somewhat similar ... Stranded on a location strange and unfamilar.  What would you expect on story that is like Robinson Crusoe?

You might recognize actor Adam West who went on to be Batman in iconic tv series.

Don't expect the ""action scene every 12 minutes"" like in today's movies.  It will entertain but keep in mind it was made many years ago ..  before the original Star Trek series from the late 60s.

Watch with an open mind in respect to its age and the movie technology available back then.  Defintely better than many of the b and c sci-fi of the 50s.",1402704000,,950,4.416184971098266

I had watched this years ago when it was first released and enjoyed it, but over the years my tastes and expectations have changed so when I saw amazon had it, I watched it.  Didnt expect to like it, but was pleasantly surprised.  The science was good for the time it was made, though what we know now makes it more unbelieveable. but it doesnt detract from enjoying it because the science is still at least believable.  The movie is also a bit campy but that is to be expected I guess and actually adds to the charm of it.  Escapeism at its better side.  Watch it...enjoy it.",1401667200,,647,4.35

It is solidly based on Daniel Defoe's classic, both in plot and world view, but, fortunately a bit more politically correct.

They made a movie about a mans survival on mars, finding commodities in the strangest way. Its an interesting look at the immense bounds we have taken in space exploration. This was made in 64'!

I had to get past several hokey things before I could get back into the movie.  The reason they marooned themselves on Mars.  The scientific method of determining if he could breathe the atmosphere by repeatedly exposing himself to it in hopes he didn't die.  Bathing in your only water supply.  Old science was definitely applied here, but it was well before the moon landing and other planetary exploration, so I'll cut them some slack.

Stars:Paul Mantee, Victor Lundin, Adam West from the Batman series  ..(PLOT)  Commander Christopher 'Kit' Draper (Paul Mantee) and Colonel Dan McReady (Adam West) reach the Red Planet in their spaceship, Mars Gravity Probe 1. They are forced to use up their remaining fuel in order to avoid an imminent collision with an orbiting meteor; they descend in their one-man lifeboat pods and become the first humans on Mars.
Draper eventually finds a cave for shelter. He then figures out how to obtain the rest of what he needs to survive: he burns some coal-like rocks for warmth and accidentally discovers that heating them releases trapped oxygen. This allows him to refill his air tanks and move around in the thin Martian atmosphere. On one of his excursions, he finds McReady's crashed pod and dead body. He soon finds Mona, their flight-test monkey, and returns with her to the cave. Draper then constructs a crude sand alarm clock to awaken him for periodic doses of oxygen.
Later, he notices that Mona keeps disappearing and is uninterested in their dwindling supply of food and water. He gives her a salty cracker but no water; when Mona gets very thirsty, he lets her out and follows her to an underground spring in a cave with edible plant ""sausages"" growing in the water.
As the days grow into months, Draper slowly begins to crack from the prolonged isolation. He watches helplessly as his spaceship, an inaccessible ""supermarket,"" periodically orbits overhead; without fuel, the ship cannot respond to his radioed order to land.
While walking about, Draper comes upon a rock standing in an odd position. Curious, he digs in the ground around it, exposing a skeletal hand wearing a black bracelet. He uncovers the rest of the humanoid skeleton and determines that the alien was murdered: the skull shows heavy charring. To hide his presence on Mars, Draper signals his spaceship to self-destruct on its next overhead pass.
Just in time, too, as Draper sees a spaceship descend and land just over the horizon. Believing it might be a rescue ship from Earth, the following morning he heads towards the landing site, only to see a manta ray-shaped alien spacecraft in the sky. He then approaches the site cautiously and sees slave labor being used for mining. One of the slaves (Victor Lundin) escapes, running into Draper; the alien ship blasts their area as the two escape. Draper notices the stranger is wearing black bracelets just like the one he found. The aliens bombard the mine area that night and then depart. When he and the stranger investigate, they find the bodies of the other slaves.
Draper names his new acquaintance ""Friday,"" after the character in Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, and begins teaching him English. In return Friday provides him with ""air pills"" that provide oxygen; they gradually grow to trust and then like each other. Draper then finds out ""Friday"" is from a planet orbiting the star Alnilam.
After a while the alien spacecraft returns, tracking Friday by his bracelets; Draper begins sawing away at the tough material with wire. When the aliens blast the castaways' hiding place, Draper, Friday, and Mona flee north through the underground Martian canals. They eventually surface near the polar icecap. Exhausted, freezing, and nearly out of the air pills, they build a snow shelter. Draper finally succeeds in cutting off Friday's bracelets shortly before the low orbit of the narrowly avoided meteor decays, crashing into the Martian ice cap; the resulting explosion and firestorm melts the ice and snow.
Later, Draper detects an approaching spaceship. He fears it is the returning aliens, but is relieved when his radio set picks up an English-speaking voice; Draper and Friday watch as a descending rescue ship lands. As the film credits roll, Mars gradually recedes in the distance.  A must have movie, but get the Blu-ray instead of the DVD... you will not be sorry!!",1396742400,,4202,4.915492957746479

And the campy but good movie, EARTH VS THE FLYING SAUCERS.

Robinson Crusoe on Mars takes what was known science and part exploratory science and makes it believable.  Though it seemed they didn't have a big budget and CGI was a still far away, the movie made you feel part of it. I have seen this movie a few times on television. Each time its on I watch it.

It was great and I will never forget it.  This was before Adam West was known as Batman.  The special effects are outstanding for it's time.

I particularly liked the movement of space ships in the sky, those jerky movements, were a great effect as to the incredible speed to the alien spacecraft to maneuver in the sky. The movie was well-written and held my attention. Those wrist bracelets on Friday also added a brilliant touch of suspense, knowing the aliens would return at any moment and those bracelets were going to slap together. One could ponder a lot of enhancements ot the movie, but sci-fi movies generally did not have budgets anywhere approaching epic fims like Cleopatra or Ben Hur.

2884697,4,B000SFJ4K4,"As the title indicates, this film is a retelling of De Foe's timeless tale. But it is not merely a retelling, but also an adaptation--though better described as a transposition. By that, I mean that the film does something akin to a person taking a piano score, and expanding it for a full orchestral, or vice versa.

Haskin transposes a story from the latter-end of the Age of Discoveries to the dawn of the Space Ace. Instead of aquanauts, we have astronauts. Instead of South America, we shipwreck on Mars. Friday, no longer a savage, is now an alien slave. It's the same story, dressed up in a space suit.

But here's the profundity. This film reminds us that, at the dawn of the Space Age, we must realize that this is the really the beginning a second Age of Discoveries. And that we must have the same resourcefulness, ingenuity, and courage  The same intrepidity, dash, daring, and cagey survival skills would be necessary for us to go to the Moon--and beyond.

I like the transposition. It's not quite hard science. All aliens look human. Carl Sagan complained that Star Trek, with Spock's mixed parentage, violates "" elementary scientific facts.""

(Actually, he says that it would easier to cross a human with an artichoke, than to crossbreed two independently-evolved species. But I digress.)

The terran hardware, however, looks accurate. The clunky transistorized solid-state computer Draper lugs around look like something from that era. I appreciate this realism used in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Destination-Moon/dp/B000YSR01U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Destination Moon</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2001-A-Space-Odyssey/dp/B000HEBCZQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2001: A Space Odyssey</a>-franchise.

Remember also that this film was released two months after the first Project Gemini test flight occurred. People expected astronauts to fly as pairs. Hence Adam ""Batman"" West's quasi-cameo costarring role. And the escape pods are very Gemini-esque.

Now a word about the overt religiosity. It traces back to the source-text: Crusoe's shipwreck was a punishment for vanity, and worldliness. Also, De Foe references God 161 times. For a comparison, Verne, in his shipwreck tale The Mysterious Island, has the men celebrate Sunday, Whitsunday, and Easter (Chapter 13). Long before the French existentialists came along, people knew that being shipwrecked is a metaphor for life.

You see, God is not as cut and dried as the Inquisition or as Richard Dawkins make Him out to be. Even Aquinas could not put Him in a logical box: he understood that there were ""certain truths which exceed human reason"" and that if we were left to our own devices, our understanding of God ""would only be known by a few, and that after a long time, and with the admixture of many errors"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Shorter-Summa-The-Essential-Philosophical-Passages-of-Saint-Thomas-Aquinas-Summa-Theologica/dp/0898704383/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Shorter Summa: The Essential Philosophical Passages of Saint Thomas Aquinas' Summa Theologica</a>, 40, ST 1.1.1)

Moreover, an overt religious sensibility was part of the times (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ben-Hur-The-Ten-Commandments-Blu-ray/dp/B00AMSLDW4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ben-Hur / The Ten Commandments [Blu-ray</a>],&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quo-Vadis-Blu-ray/dp/B001ECQ6E2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quo Vadis  [Blu-ray</a>], The Story of Mankind), not only in religious epics, but also in science fiction.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forbidden-Planet/dp/B001N3EZW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forbidden Planet</a>&nbsp;has two references to God:

* ""The Lord sure makes some beautiful worlds.""
* ""We're all part monsters in our subconscious, so we have laws and religion!""

The War of the Worlds (1953), also expresses faith: ""After all that men could do had failed, the Martians were destroyed and humanity was saved by the littlest things, which God, in His wisdom, had put upon this Earth."" Which is also traces back to the source-text Wells (H.G., not Orson).

The most overt theological references comes from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Incredible-Shrinking-Man/dp/B0036024VE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Incredible Shrinking Man</a>&nbsp;(1957): ""Existence begins and ends in man's conception, not nature's. And I felt my body dwindling, melting, becoming nothing. My fears melted away. And in their place came acceptance. All this vast majesty of creation, it had to mean something. And then I meant something, too. Yes, smaller than the smallest, I meant something, too. To God, there is no zero. I still exist!""

God is part of the film's message. If we can achieve interplanetary harmony under God, then why not interracial and interpolitical harmony for beings on the same planet?

Brotherhood indeed. Draper frees Friday from his handcuffs, and Friday shares his oxygen pills with Draper. And in citing the 23rd Psalm, Draper expresses gratitude for being blessed despite his hardships.

2884711,4,B000SFJ4K4,"When I was a little kid I caught this movie on a Saturday ""matinee"" on television. I was young and thought the movie was really cool back then. Looking at it today most of that coolness still stands. Robinson Crusoe on Mars is one of those benchmark sci-fi movies that I think every fan of the genre should watch. It's not an action movie, even it though it tries to have its moments of suspense and fanfare. Very true to its namesake the movie is more about general survival in the rocky wilderness of Mars. For you younger folk who never read Robinson Crusoe think of it as Tom Hanks' Castaway in space.

What is the plot? An astronaut ends up bailing out of his spaceship and crash lands on Mars. He is the lone human survivor with no way to contact home and has to figure out the best way he could to survive by figuring out where he can get oxygen, shelter, water and food. He ends up finding an alien ex-slave (his pal Friday) along with the alien slavers, and soon have to escape the slaver's attacks.

What makes the movie is how they chronicle this lone astronaut's (played by Paul Mantee) struggle for survival. The best parts of the movie for me concern his discoveries on Mars that help him survive. It puts you there with him wondering how he can live without this or that and it gives you that feeling of payoff when he does find a solution. To keep the viewer up with the narrative he records the occasional audio log, which makes for a nice approach on letting everybody in on what he discovers. This is a character piece more than anything else on this level.

Robinson Crusoe on Mars also took great pains to work as close to what was scientifically plausible as possible. This is not something you normally find in sci-fi movies of the 50's and 60's. You see spaceships use maneuvering thrusters to change course and launch lunar lander type vessels before NASA announced such concepts for the moon mission years later. Ship control systems looked and operated like they should instead of just buttons lighting up and dials spinning randomly. Aerospace was taken seriously. We may now know more specifically how inhospitable Mars and its atmosphere is, but back in the 60's the speculation was more aligned to the film and a fair amount of detail was given on oxygen management and how to cope with it. Sure there were fictional elements that helped along the way, but they were based on strong scientific principles and weren't afraid to show it. I can go on and on about it, but suffice it to say the level of technical detail for a mid-60's movie is impressive.

Now the aliens and their technology of course end the scientific observations and go into more science fantasy with fast moving alien vessels (which were modified models from the original War of the Worlds), ray guns and other nifty speculative tech. To me the alien attacks feel more like a distraction and spend too much time with the mayhem, which often feels like you are seeing the same mountain get blown up over and over again. I understand you need a change of pace for a movie like this, but I do feel the weakest points in the film come from the alien attacks. Also I felt the ending was rather abrupt and felt too convenient for my tastes. A little more development on the conclusion would have upped my rating of this film. As far as any plot holes I suppose I can knit pick a few other elements if I wanted to, or I can find plausible reasons for them as well. Either way they do end up being small issues.

The DVD is a really nice transfer. So good I am wondering how sweet the Blu-Ray looks. Unfortunately the mastering also shows the limitations of the special effects. Matted backdrops have a very different color sharpness than the foreground in those instances. Nothing that ruins the movie. It's just par for the course when I get a film that didn't have robust special effects resources. Audio is clean even though it is still mono. I did notice certain points in the film a certain special effect like a ship flying by or alien death ray explosions would hit the volume to the top compared to the dialog, but it's not that bad. The special features (aptly titled Survival Kit) are pretty impressive, although I think the laser disc may still have more. Here is the breakdown:

Audio Commentary - This is a sweet extra. It's a collection of commentaries from the actors, special effects wizard and a vintage interview from the director. All of it good stuff and very enjoyable and insightful to listen to.

Destination: Mars - This documentary mostly delves with the science of the time that was incorporated into the movie. You won't get any ""making of"" specifics here, but for anybody interested in the evolution of science from the 60's until as well as how science of the day was crafted into the movie then it's a good feature.

Theatrical Trailer - You can see how pushy they were on the scientific accuracy of the film. It's pretty much what you would expect from a 60's movie trailer with a lot of hype talking up the film.

Production Stills - A very interesting showing that also gives notes and what you are seeing. Most of it is conceptual drawings that shown how the design evolved between the original crew and the one that started filming.

Music Video - No this isn't an MTV promotional revamp. Actor Victor Lundin (i.e. his pal Friday) wrote a song about the movie and here you have it along with clips of the film. The cult fans love it, but as a normal viewer I would just pass.

DVD ROM - Put the DVD in your computer and you will get the more interesting sections of the script for the movie.

Robinson Crusoe on Mars didn't do too well at the box office, but it has quite a legacy. If you are into the science in sci-fi this is right up your alley, especially if you have a soft spot for the classics. Fans of a little drama or survival films will enjoy this too for obvious reasons. You crave nothing but action? This may not be for you. As I mentioned before I believe this film to be required viewing for any self respecting science fiction fan as it is an important film in the genre heritage.",1354752000,,6126,4.4695885509839

There is plenty to criticize in the scientific accuracy area, but let's remember this film is almost 50 years old, and reflects the scientific information we had at the time.  Some scientists still maintained the canals on Mars existed and were constructed by a Martian civilization! So please put your modern knowledge aside when you view this film.

Some feel the film feels too long.  Remember the pacing of this film is meant to stress the monotony of being marooned.  Also, the pacing of films (and television) today has become quite frenetic, and the world of 1964 was at a much slower pace.

Overall, the film stands head and shoulders above the ""B-movie"" schlock was being geared toward the teenagers of the day,  and the film set the stage for the impressive ""2001:A Space Odyssey"" that would follow in 4 years.",1347235200,2,884,4.776315789473684

2884719,3,B000SFJ4K4,"Robinson Crusoe on Mars is literally the story of Robinson Crusoe, yet retold in a modern fashion about a man who is marooned on mars due to a meteor striking his ship. Finding out that his mate has tragically died, he is forced to find means of oxygen, water, and food with only his pet monkey Mona to keep him company. Throughout the course of this movie I was just waiting for something to happen. When something finally does, and I will refrain from mentioning for reasons of spoiling the film to others, I was so happy that some sort of conflict was finally ensuing. Yet after the main conflict had gone, the film sort of sank back into it's ritual of scene after scene of virtually the same thing. Now don't get me wrong, I don't mean to sound like I disliked the film. On the contrary, I found it to be entertaining and for the most point, very interesting. Here, you have a film and director who takes their film very seriously indeed. What I mean by that, is this simply wasn't a kiddish Science Fiction film where anything can happen. Even the terminology of the spaceship was believable. The dialogue, what little of it there was, was well written and once again, very insightful and interesting. For sure though, a movie of this manner could only be a good hour and twenty minutes at the most, right? Sadly, not at all. This movie pulls in at a good two hours! Now, two hours, mind you, is not perhaps that long at all. After all it is quality not quantity is it not? For a movie such as this, and for the story it tells, it could have EASILY told it in under and hour and a half. Yet, because of it's length I grew bored and threw hopeful glances at the Blu Ray player to see when it would be done. When the movie finally drew to a close, then ending, believe it or not, was laughably rushed to the point where I found myself sitting on the couch thinking, ""Oh, that's the ending. Okay then."" If there was anything that they NEEDED to extend or ""drag out"", by all means, it was definitely the ending. My conclusion, sitting there, was exactly this: An okay movie, interesting, but just too long for it's own good and for the story that it was trying to tell. Will I watch it again? Yes, but only to see that if re - watching it will perhaps be better in terms of length.",1337990400,6,2283,4.287037037037037

2884724,5,B000SFJ4K4,"I'm a big sci fi lover, and have read hundreds of sci fi books and viewed dozens of sci fi movies, plus a 40 year amateur astronomer and life member of the Mars Society. You can see my interest in this DVD.

The plot, color and audio were excellent on this DVD. The special effects were superb by Byron Haskin ( The War of the Worlds, Outer Limits) The acting was great. Adam West ( star of Batman TV series) even has a role in the beginning of the movie. Included with the DVD is a nice pamphlet describing the movie, some history of the 1964 movie and more. The reader will enjoy this.

Two men in a spacecraft to Mars are forced to fire retro rockets to avoid a Meteor. This puts them into an erratic plunge to Mars and both are forced to eject in their own escape pods. The controls of the spacecraft were a little outdated.

Both escape pods crash and the Commander in charge of the mission ( Adam West) is killed. The second officer ""Kit"" Draper(Paul Mantee) and a monkey named Mona survive. Then comes survival off the land and air?

First getting enough air. He takes his visor off now and then to talk into a mike. We know today Mars has only 1% Earth atmosphere mostly CO2...death would be real quick. Also he would be eventually blinded as there is massive amounts of UV radiation getting through the thin atmosphere. Kit finds yellow rocks that when burned give off oxygen. Can't live at night on Mars  at night in a cave with fire from yellow rocks as it gets well below -100F.

Next finding water. Mona the monkey finds both water and plant ""sausage"" bulbs to eat. Today we know water can not exist as a liquid on the Mars surface due to low atmospheric pressure. Macro life on Mars very improbable because of conditions. Maybe extinct or living microorganisms under the regolith or deep in lava tubes.

All this said just relax and enjoy the movie. Just wanted the reader to know Mars is much, much more hostile than  depicted on the DVD. .

So our Robinson Crusoe has licked all the basic needs of survival except loneliness. Kit starts hallucinating his Commander is alive. Not!

Kit sees weird, fast moving spacecraft in the Martian sky at night. Mining craft from another world. They start blasting all over the place. Kit is outside of the cave with his oxygen bottle and no spacesuit (would be quick death). As he is hiding a humanoid stands near him. It is an escaped slave the ships are trying to blast and kill with their rays.

They hurry back to the cave. Now Kit has companionship. I won't ruin the movie for you. Just say great survival scenes, educating his man Friday and visa versa. Both repeatedly save each others life. There are great scenes of both of them and Mona traveling the underground canals of Mars to escape the ""enemy"" and reach the polar ice cap. The ending is superb.

If the reader does not constantly try to analyse the ""faults"" of the survival he/she will enjoy this wonderful movie. I loved it even though I knew it could never happen like it was shown.

5 stars to add to your Science Fiction DVD library. My only fault of the DVD was the cost. I could not get one on the cheap and had to pay near full price. I guess that's to be expected with supply and demand as this was a great movie on DVD. INMO one of the best Science Fiction /Mars/fantasy movies ever made.",1327017600,7,3317,4.3827361563517915
2884725,5,B000SFJ4K4,"I just discovered this film and I simply can not understand why it is so little known. I was hooked to the screen from the first minutes to the very end and I simply couldn't believe my eyes, watching a very litteral adaptation of Daniel Defoe's immortal masterpiece - with just the main hero stranded on another planet, instead of a desert island.

This is an old film and for that reason the technology shown is somehow dated - the world progressed a lot since 1964. But after the first five minutes I completely forgot to pay attention to it and I simply followed the adventures of Commander ""Kit"" Draper, as his spaceship crashed on Mars leaving him stranded there, with a little monkey named Mona as only companion.

As one of the previous reviewers already mentioned, this film is indeed divided in two parts. The first one describes Draper's painful quest for basic survival, beginning with THE problem - how to solve the issue of oxygen supply. Mars atmosphere in this movie is somehow richer in oxygen than in reality, but not enough to allow a human to survive for an extended period. Other basic problems include shelter, heating, water and food. And other challenges. This first part of the film is really excellent.

The second part begins with Draper rescuing from a certain death Friday, who in this film is a human looking alien from Orion Belt. The two men learn progressively to speak their languages and become friends. Later, together with Mona, they will have to face their toughest challenge yet, which will include exploration of some of the most dangerous places on Mars. This part of the movie is a little bit weaker, but still very good.

The description of Mars in this film is excellent, although COMPLETELY different from the real life Red Planet. Still, I simply loved the images of Mars mountains, valleys, deserts and other features which I will let you discover by yourself - and the scene with both Deimos and Phobos rising over the rugged mountain peaks is simply beautiful! The strange volcano in form of a deep crack in the planet surface, with a permanent gigantic flame reaching almost to the limit of the atmosphere is another feature which didn't age at all and still can impress.

I was impressed by the way Draper took care of his little furry companion. The little monkey, although a tough little survivor itself, needs nevertheless to be protected and sometimes cuddled when it feels lonely. Scenes in which Mona goes to sleep in her little bed, after sharing Draper's meal, are very touching.

Another thing which I really appreciated were the Christian elements, today mostly absent from sci-fi movies. Draper prays occasionaly, but sincerely, when walking through the merciless wilderness of the Red Planet. Also when he finally can communicate with Friday, he realizes that both humans and aliens worship the One God, Father Almighty, Creator of Universe - although the Orionites have of course a different ritual and their name for ""Lord"" sounds somehow like a painful sneeze...

Byron Haskin, who directed this film, is today mostly remembered for his excellent adaptation of another great book, ""The War of the worlds"" (1953), still the best movie based on Wells masterpiece. But this film is at least as good! I will keep it preciously to rewatch it again someday, as I spend a really good moment with Draper, Friday, Mona - and Mars.",1326931200,10,3387,4.8293103448275865

2884738,5,B000SFJ4K4,"I am writing this review to tell everyone just how good this film looks on Blu-Ray. As far as I can see today, there are no other reviews here for the Blu-Ray version of the film (I saw just one review from a guy who seems to think the aspect ratio on Blu-Ray is wrong....it's not....in fact it looks more accurate than the DVD in terms of the anamorphic transfer).

Before I give a few details, I feel I have to say that I just love this film. The 5-star rating is for the film. I also give the Blu-Ray top marks (4+) considering the source material. I have enjoyed this movie since I was a kid and saw it on TV in the late 1960s and 70s. So, naturally, I have a rather soft spot in my heart for the film itself. The day I found it on LaserDisc (about 1990 I think) was a happy day indeed. I bought the DVD when it was released a few years and I was happy with it, too. The Criterion material is almost the same on each three versions (not exactly the same, but I won't recount the details here because if you want to see this move in all its glory, then you will want the Blu-Ray regardless of its lack of a few extras that were on the LaserDisc).

The really good news is that this film has never looked so good! I bet it even looks better than it did when it was projected in theatres over 47 years ago. Yes, the film stock is a bit grainy (just as it was in the DVD format) due to the film stock used in 1963. The picture is much clearer, brighter, and has far better color fidelity than the DVD. The transfer of this old film onto this modern high-resolution format (1080p/24) is rather amazing, I must say. I will even admit that seeing it look this good brought a lump to my throat when I thought of all the times I watched it on a small black and white TV.

I compared the Blu-Ray to the DVD using a Playstation3. The exceptional transfer to Blu-Ray does mean that you can see the small flaws in the optical effects (for example when the fireballs move across the screen or when the character ""watches"" movies of how to find water on another planet or when he's taking a swim in the underground pool Mona finds). That's a small price to pay, so to speak, for the wonderful look of the rest of the film. The skyline views of Mars are just magnificent--the dark, starry sky against the reddish atmosphere, the daytime shots....wow, in Blu-Ray the film's many wonderful vista shots are almost breathtaking. I know, I know. I sound breathless. I am. Bringing this movie to Blu-Ray so soon after the long-awaited DVD release is a real gift and, I think, a wonderful tribute to this wonderful old film. Of course, the price of both the DVD and Blu-Ray are high (they are, after all, Criterion products). But, if you're a fan of films like this one, you know the high price is justified. If you own the DVD version, buying the Blu-Ray will not be money wasted.

I will also mention that I own a high-end 60-inch rear projection set (Sony's KDS series which is no longer made) and a high-end 52-inch LCD set (Sony's XBR9 series). The film actually looks best on my projection set, but then I'm partial to most films on it rather than on LCD. Oh, and if anyone does review this Blu-Ray and tries to assert that it's not that much better than the DVD, then you can be sure he/she has an inferior TV that is incapable of showing the difference between the two (oh, if I had a nickel for every such review I have read on Amazon I'd be able to buy copies of this Blu-Ray dics for all my friends!).

In summary, if you are wondering whether to buy this film on Blu-Ray, I say the answer is YES. Buy it. Enjoy it. Show it to your family, friends, even the whole neighborhood. There's so much crap being produced nowadays (i.e., repetitive special effects instead of a good story or poor remakes or ""reimaginings"" like ""The Day the Earth Stood Still""). I think it's refreshing to watch a good, old movie that was a valid, even valiant, effort to be a ""scientifically-accurate"" (with what was known about Mars at the time) adventure tale that was at least loosely based on the famous Dafoe novel. (I do like that ""Friday"" in this version comes from a more-advanced technology, not a less-advanced one like the novel.)

Oh, and if you want to buy--or even borrow--my LaserDisc, it's not for sale or to lend. <grin>

2884740,5,B000SFJ4K4,"This movie was released in 1964 which makes it one of the last movies in the golden age of sci-fi (2001 was only 4 yrs. away). Criterion Collection had the smarts to freshen it up, put it on blu-ray. The movie stars Paul Mantee as Christopher'Kit' Draper, a lone stranded astronaut. After crashing on Mars he finds that his mother ship, now running auto pilot, is still orbiting the planet. It sweeps by every couple of days as he attempts to signal it. His only companion is a fellow monkey astronaut(Mona). Kit has his hands full trying to survive and Mona besides providing needed companionship also helps him find water. Robinson Crusoe on Mars has an intelligent script, adventure and mystery as aliens show up in the 2nd half of the movie (which is where he will meet his new friend 'Friday' from the Robinson Crusoe classic novel). Movies like this which have less dialogue due to plot elements have to be spot on because of this limitation(think also of the more recent WALLE or Cast Away with Tom Hanks). But it is nonetheless fun and interesting. If I had a collection of the top films of the golden age of science fiction this would be in there.

Others I would include- 'War of the Worlds' 'Day the Earth Stood Still' the original 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' 'Them' 'The Thing from another planet' 'Forbidden Planet' 'The Time Machine' and I should probably list the 1927 silent film ""Metropolis' but that's just me.",1295222400,,1433,4.664031620553359

There is a brief appearance of Adam West (Batman) in the beginning of the movie. You definitely have to possess imagination to view this movie and appreciate what the producers were able to do at that time to make this a great movie for that era. If your interest levels touch on life on another planet and you can find some humor in the props that were used then you will enjoy this film.

Superb adventure movie using just three actors (Paul Mantee, Adam West and Victor Lundin) and one Wooley Monkey. For fans of the old pre-""2001"" space opera movies, this is a must-have.

Victor Lundin maintains a website and surprisingly, he answers e-mails from fans. He related to me that the sausage plants discovered by Cmdr. Draper were actually small Italian sausages, and that the oxygen pills carried by Friday were brown M&M's. Mr. Lundin says that after 8 weeks filming in Death Valley, he does NOT eat those things any more!

Look how close they were in many of the features of Mars. Granted there were also a lot of misses, but not too bad a guess when you realize we were still smashing the Ranger spacecraft into the moon and the first ever sucessful fly-by of Mars occured the same year this movie came out.

With limited food, water and oxygen, he must find a way to live. These kinds of films are a button monkey's wet dream, with lots of blinking lights and inexplicable dials and gauges. The science is suspect, as evidenced by the scene where the astronaut, low on oxygen, sucks on a pressurized tank like it was a Big Gulp, rocks that release oxygen when warmed up and underground grottos teeming with sausage plants (seriously). The film falls apart towards the end, however, with the introduction of the unnecessary and uninteresting aliens and Friday, reenvisioned as an interstellar slave to the aliens.

It explores situations that involve human problems in an alien world. I am glad I found it and think the price is worth it if you are a sci-fi fan. Even if you aren't it's a great movie and I highly recomend it!!,1256860800,,494,3.8058252427184467
2884750,5,B000SFJ4K4,"A spaceship orbiting Mars - man's first mission to another world. Two crew members, Colonel Dan McReady (Adam West) and Commander Christopher Draper (Paul Mantee), and a monkey named Mona. A meteor heads towards them and they have to take evasive action - they have to use up all their fuel, and both astronauts eject and land on Mars, as they no longer have the fuel to return to Earth. We follow Draper, who with Mona lands on the edge of a mountain range and spends the first part of the film trying to stay alive and to find McReady (""Mac"") who has landed some distance away on the other side of the mountains. Draper's hopes of companionship are quickly dashed when he finds Mac dead, but he gains a reprieve from a quick death by asphyxiation or lack of water and food thanks to some strange burning rocks that give off oxygen, and through Mona's instinctual location of food and water.

The film does a good job at trying to keep scientifically accurate - according to the standards of the day. There was still a belief in 1964 that the Martian atmosphere was a little denser than we now know it to be - so we find Draper able to breathe it for a short period. Water and vegetation seemed unlikely, but not impossible; Draper finds both after an extensive search, but no animal life. Most of the planet is depicted as a stark desert, warm enough for a man to go about in normal clothes during the day, cold enough that heat is needed at night.

The largest suspension of disbelief required comes when Draper encounters an alien mining expedition manned by slaves and rescues one of them - his ""man Friday."" Friday (Victor Lundin) is completely human, looking like a native Central or South American tribesman in loincloth; it turns out that he isn't Martian but from somewhere else, a captive slave. During the last third of the film, he and Draper form a friendship and partnership, trying to break Friday's shackles which are a homing beacon for the slave-mining ships which continually harass the two as they make their way towards the pole and more water after being rousted from the source they have. Yes, Friday is far-fetched - but I think the filmmakers made a wise choice by just having him human, and not relying on the hokey effects of the day; there also isn't really any reason to believe that Friday and his tribe couldn't have been taken from Earth at one point or another, something the film doesn't really explore but, in my opinion doesn't really need to.

The point, after all, is survival, and this is one of the better such adventure films that I've seen; Draper is quite realistically presented as a resourceful man with vast training who never gives up and manages to construct a life for himself for months in a hostile environment. Certain experiences are of course heavily condensed, like his teaching of English to Friday, but the film thus manages to pack an awful lot into less than two hours with no wasted space -- it trusts us to fill in the blanks.

I don't remember the novel, Robinson Crusoe, published in 1719 by Daniel Defoe, all that well. Obviously it described the shipwreck and life on an island, not on another planet, but in many regards this adaptation by screenwriters Ib Melchior and John C. Higgins and director Byron Haskin manages to be faithful to the basic concept of the novel while managing to be an excellent piece of (mostly) smart science fiction as well. It's gorgeous shot in Cinemascope by Winton C. Hoch, who seems to have specialized in science fiction both on film and TV - the bright and pastel colors may seem excessive at times but they sure are pretty and they definitely contribute to a feeling of alienness - and Paul Mantee brings real intelligence and determination to his role with just enough pathos, though this element is definitely reigned in. Director Haskin had made ""The War of the Worlds"" and ""From the Earth to the Moon"" within the previous decade and got his start as a special effects technician; he too brings great commitment to the project.

I suppose it will seem hokey or silly or boring to many now; judging from its average rating, I'm fairly certain of that. It's too bad; there are few big-budget science fiction films that really attempt anything like what this film does from this era, and it should be remembered better. Clearly it has some admirers, as the handsome Criterion edition shows. I urge anyone with a serious interest in the genre to check it out.

This disc isn't the most exciting of Criterion discs in terms of supplements, but the featurette on the science and making of is well done; I haven't listened to the commentary track yet.  The transfer seems exceptional though never having seen the film theatrically I of course can't say for sure.",1253059200,,4760,4.6393831553973905
2884751,4,B000SFJ4K4,"This is good hard scifi, told as an adaptation to the Defoe classic.  The sole survivor realistically struggles to survive and finds some interseting ways of doing so, such as his chance discovery that certain rocks gave off scarce oxygen.  He sets himself up pretty well, then is surprised to discover slaves arrive with a seemingly technologically superior race.

While the arrival of the alines was a bit puzzling to me - where are they from?  Why don't earthmen know about them?  Whey do they keep themselves hidden from humans?  Are they a race of men?  it is tantilizingly never made clear, also a mark of good scifi.  There is nothing that ruins the mystery of it, which is fun and had lived in my imagination since my father took me to see this when I was 8.

But what about the sound?

Oh, boy. What *about* the sound? Maybe I just have a faulty copy, but the sound levels fluctuate wildly, badly distorting the music and sound effects (though not so much the dialogue). It's just horrible. It's almost like somebody put the sound through a limiter, so that every time it gets above a certain level it drops right down again. If my copy really is typical then on the basis of the sound quality there's no way I can give it a 5-star rating and Criterion ought to be ashamed.",1251849600,11,787,4.542253521126761
2884754,4,B000SFJ4K4,"When I think of ROBINSON CRUSOE ON MARS the title, it conjours thoughts of JESSE JAMES MEETS FRANKENSTEIN'S DAUGHTER or SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS. It just simply cannot be a good movie I would think. The fact of the matter is, ROBINSON CRUSOE ON MARS is one of the best sci-fi movies of the 1960s. One of the main reasons for this is the attention to detail the director uses. For example, they make a good attempt at showing weightlessness in the space ship. Also, a lot of movies that take place on Mars at least at the time, portrayed it as having enough oxygen to sustain human life. Our hero on this movie soon finds out after he lands on Mars that he can't just take off his helmet and start breathing. He has to figure out a means to maintain enough oxygen to survive. It's a really fun, good movie that should have been DVD long ago. I'm glad Criterion released it. It's very much deservant of being released on the Criterion Collection.",1249344000,3,953,4.420454545454546
2884755,4,B000SFJ4K4,"Robinson Crusoe On Mars ultimately succeeds (unlike other contemporaneous Mars-based films like the John Carradine vehicle The Wizard Of Mars, aka Horrors Of The Red Planet) because, rather than the tired old Cold War motif the film could have fallen into, it supplies a motif of a small society struggling to deal with a larger one, as well as some obvious parallels to the ongoing Civil Rights movement (such as the Underground Railroad (when the two escape into the submartian canals). Kit is the Great White Hunter and Friday the Noble Savage, except that neither really is that one dimensional, and as the film wears on, after Friday's arrival just after its midpoint, the two men's relationship grows more equal, with Kit even learning some of Friday's language. Both Mantee and Lundin are superb in their roles, and one need only look at the near remake of this film from 1985 (Enemy Mine) to see how wrong a film like this could have gone with lesser actors, and the film is rife with 'little' moments that are gems- such as Friday not taking his oxygen pills so Kit can have more, and Kit speaking to Friday in his own language when Friday saves him after a meteor explodes and covers them both in ash. Mantee, especially, does an excellent job of emoting to himself and the monkey for the first half of the 110 minute long film.

The film's minor flaws are just that, and the unresolved questions, such as why does Kit not float more?, since Mars has a much weaker gravity than earth, or where and how does he urinate and defecate?, since we are shown Kit nude anyway, are simply part of that disbelief a viewer needs to suspend for the better aspects of the film to work. Once that bargain is affirmed, however, few will not find something admirable about this neglected classic of science fiction filmdom. And those that might object to Robinson Crusoe On Mars are likely the sort who feel that art must be truth anyway; thus denying themselves the best of a genre that can entertain while it enlightens, and vice versa.

2884758,4,B000SFJ4K4,"There has long been a sort of mystical infatuation with our neighboring red planet.  Scientists have been optimistic in their beliefs that water, oxygen, and a low form of animal are quite possible there.  This 1964 film explores these notions in completely captivating fashion.

ROBINSON CRUSOE ON MARS has no nasty one-eyed beasts that crave human flesh.  It uses less extreme but ultimately more realistic and compelling instuments of fear--like overcoming the immediate obstacles for survival(oxygen, water, food, shelter) and ultimately a greater challenge--isolation.

This part of the story is truly amazing.  After a close call with an incoming meteor, Commander ""Kit"" Draper is forced to make an emergency landing.  He is ill-equipped for an extended stay on Mars, and so the frantic struggle for survival begins.

I'm telling you, the first half is totally awesome.  It reminded my of Tom Hanks in CAST AWAY, but with the grim circumstances elevated tenfold.  Kit slowly starts his descent into madness, as the internal struggle with loneliness becomes too much to bear.

Eventually though, he does meet some company.  This is where the film loses a little bit of its luster.  Kit runs into a silent humanoid who he names ""Friday"".  This alien being has a pretty absurd resemblance to us Earthlings.  Well, apparently Friday is an escaped intergalactic mining slave, and his alien captors are hot on his trail.

The brief look we get at his pursuers is disappointing too, as they appear to be some humans in fancy space suits.  Some slight changes to these aliens (pointy ears, pale skin, horns, etc...) would have been greatly beneficial.

One cool thing about the aliens was their spaceships.  Even though they are an exact replica of the machines from THE WAR OF THE WORLDS, there is something really eerie about their movements.  I guess the film editors decided to remove every other frame, in order to double the craft's apparent speed.  The result is some pretty awkward, jerky, lateral shifting that looks....well...alien?  Strange but cool.

All-in-all, this is an imperfect but still exceptional journey into space.  Highly recommended to lovers of sci-fi.  4.5 stars.",1245542400,,2188,5.1477272727272725

It came out just as the American space program was on the verge of going full throttle toward the moon and our knowledge was just beginning to increase re: the improbability of exotic ""Flash Gordon"" like alien civilizations existing elsewhere in this solar system. Of course we all know Mars to be much deader and more inhospitable to most life-forms than was known at that time. But don't let that knowledge interfere with your enjoyment of a classic ""man on a desert island"" premise transposed to a technologically advanced future.

Survival on another planet has always intrigued me and so has Mars.

When I rented the (beautifully transferred) Criterion DVD of ""Robinson Crusoe on Mars"", I secretly hoped I had discovered a sci-fi sleeper/gem.  It really had everything working in its favor.  The plot line and literary parallel intrigued me, and I had once read something positive about this seldomly mentioned film.  Well, as in real-world geology, I discovered that true gems are rare.

My own conclusion is that RCOM is a type of cult film (nothing wrong with that), perfect for a certain sort of  science-fiction viewer (I won't attempt here to describe them).  For me, though, the level of interest, involvement, and 'credibility' just never rose too high on the thermometer.  I certainly didn't hate it (I'd give it 3 1/2 stars if I could), but like I've said I was hoping for something special.  I would rate it on a par with some of the better Star Trek TV installments (original series), though not as good as ""The Menagerie"" (my favorite episode).  And as far as old-time sci-fi flicks go, I would prefer stuff like War of the Worlds, The Fly, The Time Machine, and a few others.",1210118400,21,1309,4.752212389380531
2884772,4,B000SFJ4K4,"What I like so much about Robinson Crusoe on Mars is its no nonsense approach.  Even though it takes place on Mars it is very much about human problems, about the need for self-sufficiency and the equally compelling need for companionship.  The astronaut spends most of the first half of the film just trying to work out the problem of how to live on Mars -- and it holds my attention throughout.  Once he has solved that problem, his real problem is how to live alone.  He needs a companion, someone to talk to, a friend (and something more than a monkey).  Once he finds his friend there is a bit of artificial drama that comes from the fact that his former captors in their alien spacecraft want him back, but that is really secondary to the process of their coming to trust and care about and take care of each other.

Apart from the gripping story -- that kept my kids and I captivated throughout -- the visuals are gorgeous and magical.  It is really quite impressive that the filmmakers were able to turn images of the California desert (combined with surreal matte painting and lighting) into an alien landscape.  This is a fun movie, and it is beautifully restored by Criterion.",1209686400,7,1187,4.539906103286385

This Criterion Collection DVD of a movie I remember seeing as a child in the theatres is excellent quality! The picture quality and the sound are great. The extras are very nice also! The extra comparing what we thought Mars would be like when the movie was made compared to what we know know was very interesting!

It links to both films as well--the natural resources of Mars are mined by invaders who use flying search-machines reminiscent of those in WAR OF THE WORLDS; and the key tools of those invaders are slaves, oppressed and victimized by the invaders' reign of terror, much as the Eloi were the victims of the mining Morlocks in THE TIME MACHINE.

But the extra stuff on the DVD was really interesting of what was originally planned for the movie by the original producer, but was never used by the new producer for what sounds like typical movie political BS.

2884778,5,B000SFJ4K4,"Let me start by saying I love this movie.  I first saw it on TV in the mid-60s, mostly because it ""starred"" Adam West.  Batman hysteria had just begun and this was played up in the promos for the broadcast.  Well, sure he dies off pretty quickly and he's not really the star, but I didn't let that disappoint me.  I saw this on a black and white television with maybe a 20 inch screen, but it still impressed my young mind.

Last night I watched it on my 65 inch HDTV and saw it in its original splendor and I was greatly impressed.  It is visually stunning, the sound is excellent, and the movie itself still as fascinating.  I've been a fan of Byron Haskin's work for years, especially War of the Worlds and the episodes he directed for the original Outer Limits.  He put all of his technical know-how and small budget ingenuity into this film and the results are impressive.  Although I'm not familiar with the career of Van Cleave, I really enjoyed the soundtrack he composed as it adds to the overall atmosphere of the film.

I feel that the high price is justified because of the overall quality of this release.  The bonus features are a welcome addition and very entertaining.  Fans of this movie will not be disappointed.",1201651200,4,1230,4.441964285714286

No in fact they are inaccurate and it may seem slightly comical by todays standards. It is the acting and story that sell this movie. Any youngster especially should see some adventure awakened here. It will draw them into the idea that they could survive with their pet on a hostile planet with slavers. Had the title been some other obscure planet name rather than Mars I doubt so many would be so cynical. I still love this movie for the effort that went into it from all concerned. My hat is off to Paul Mantee and Byron Haskin especially. Mantee never rose to be a great star, but like Kerwin Mathews did in ""The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad"", he made you believe in a fantasy world. It may have been a B movie, but it is obvious they went at it as though it was much more. So I highly recommend you at least rent this one. I personally intend to buy it since Criterion is releasing it and because I know my wife and I will watch this enough it will more than pay for the cost of multiple rentals of it.

Even at full retail price, a restored transfer given the Criterion treatment is always well worth the (exorbitant-seeming) cost. I saw this on first release in the UK on the bottom half of a double bill ... it's very telling that I can't remember what the ""A"" movie was, but I've never forgotten this, and it does seem to have burned its way into the brains of everyone who happened across it ... I have carried the images of the Martian desert, with its awesome saturated orange and crimson skies, in my head for years, along with the sense of terrified delight I experienced when the alien ships zipped in and out of view like deadly mosquitoes ... all the more thrilling for being re-workings of the ships from ""War of the Worlds"" ... in my young mind I created an intergalactic scenario of shared and lethal technologies from Mars to the planetary systems of Orion ... a much more malevolent Universe than Ray Bradbury had offered in his Martian visions ... I also had quite a thing for Paul Mantee; he offered a much-needed filmic solace for a young gay boy growing up in 60s England. Although some fairly decent prints have been screened on cable though the years, it's the Criterion version that I've been waiting for - their growing catalog of forgotten scifi is looking more and more impressive.

2884789,5,B000SFJ4K4,"This was my favorite hard science fiction film as a child. I still remember watching it at the Saturday matinee and being totally blown away (something that would not happen again until the first Star Wars.) In fact, I was somewhat hesitant to watch it again in case it wasn't as good as my childhood memories.

I needn't have worried- this is every bit the treat that I remembered. Even after all these years the look, the technology, held up. Sure, based on what we now know about Mars you have to suspend some disbelief, but it is still an excellent survival story set on a strange world. It is also a fairly faithful adaptation of the original novel. The way that Draper systematically and scientifically sets out to provide shelter, warmth, air, water, food- and companionship- is joy and a lesson in survival. I know I often flashed back to ""what would Draper do"" in my own later life. Plus the ending is truly inspirational (and I understand and appreciate it much more as an adult.)

The look is also strictly first rate. I always did like the bright Technicolor of the period- colors bright and exotic enough to make your teeth hurt. Plus the special effects are first rate- the spaceships don't look fake. Plus the things that were borrowed from other films (aliens' space suits from Destination Moon, alien spaceships from War of the Worlds, pillar of fire from The Ten Commandments) all fit and give the film a higher budget look.

One note of caution- beware of cheap copies of this film from the UK and Australia. These claim to be region free, but they will lock up your player. You can recognise the copies by the fact that they have the original poster artwork on the case and disk.",1194048000,6,1699,4.582236842105263

2884793,4,B000SFJ4K4,"The new DVD of Robinson Crusoe on Mars appears to be on the surface a cheap public domain issue.  This is due to the shocking cover art, which looks like it has been drawn by a five year old with a crayon.

Upon closer inspection, it is of course issued on the Criterion label, famed for their collection of classic films, remastered and packaged to a high standard.  In this case, the cover art is not to a high standard.  What is even stranger, is that nowhere in the accompanying booklet, are there any stills from the film.  This leads one to think 'Is the real film even on the disc'?

But this excellent film is indeed on the disc and it is worth every penny, even it had been sold in a brown paper bag! Thrill to the scientific accuracy of the production!!!!  Hide in fear from the alien miners!  Enjoy the antics of Mona the monkey (actually portrayed by Barney, a male monkey), who is given centre stage on the aforementioned cover art with the star of the show, Paul Mantee, reduced to a bit player.  Maybe the monkey was really the star all along - have apes taken over the planet as foretold in Planet of the Apes?

Robinson Crusoe on Mars is, despite its pulp title, a great piece of early to mid 1960s cinema, with fabulously colourful sets and Death Valley standing in for the mysteriosu planet Mars.  Paul Mantee as the castaway Kit Draper is joined in his exile first by our favourite monkey and later by his Man Friday, portrayed by Vic Lundin.  TV's Adam West gets a small role as Draper's commander and returns to chilling effect later in the narrative.

Touting a great score by Nathan Van Cleave (ably assisted by his protege Fred Steiner whom this writer interviewed for an article on Van Cleave, as he is often billed on film credits), the music is a perfect blend of the patriotic and atmospheric, with an excellent quest-like theme as our heroes venture to the pole.  If only films had scores as good as this one, these days.

All in all, this release is a missed opportunity, as there should have been a decent documentary on the making of the film and one wonders why Adam West didn't get a look in on the commentary track.  But the biggest letdown by far is that abysmal cover art.",1192752000,5,2210,4.406403940886699

Although some of the speculations contained in this film concerning the nature of Mars are now a bit dated, this film has nonetheless stood the test of time, and has lost none of its zip.  The theme is simple enough: a US Astronaut is marooned on Mars and must learn to survive.  What he discovers is surprising, to say the least.  The storyline of this film moves along at a reasonably good pace, and holds the viewer's interest.

2884799,4,B000SFJ4K4,"""Robinson Crusoe on Mars"" was a noble and enjoyable attempt, if not entirely successful, to show what exploring a strange new planet would really be like, telling the tale of an astronaut in a space program not terribly far advanced from the year this movie was set (1964) on an orbital mission to Mars, who is forced to crash-land on the Red Planet and survive with what meager resources he has.

The science is not perfect (but no worse than in any ""Star Wars"" movie) and the technical effects reflect their time, but the creators of the film (who included the film's director Byron Haskin, who also directed the original ""War of the Worlds"" and several classic episodes of the 1960s ""Outer Limits series) resisted the attempt to camp it up with silly ""sci-fi"" perils.  (One of the extras indicates that an early version of the script had the hero fighting giant Mars ants!)

Their are many extras, including commentaries by the actors and film creators, pre-production designs and storyboards and more.  These appear to have been slightly truncated from those on the laserdisc version, which I previously owned, but the laserdisc had so much material that a little editing may have been in order.

One extra from the laserdisc, which I loved, I thought had been deleted but discovered to my delight is still there as an unadvertised ""Easter Egg.""

This is a recording of the 45 record of the movie's theme song ""Robinson Crusoe on Mars"" which came out when the film was first released.  Note that the DVD does contain another song with that title sung by film star Victor Lundin and included as a music video, but it is far inferior to the original song.

To hear the original song, access the theatrical trailer and go to the alternate English tracks.  One track has a short commentary from a collector of movie memorabilia (including that from ""Crusoe"") and the other has the theme song.",1191369600,19,1892,4.7439024390243905

2884804,4,B000SFJ4K4,"Criterion does its absolute best bringing ""Robinson Crusoe on Mars"" to DVD. This stunning looking DVD is an enjoyable science fiction take on the classic tale. When his mission goes awry astronaut ""Kit"" Draper (Paul Mantee) ends up stranded on the red planet and must figure out how to survive on the often hostile environment. He discovers he isn't alone and befriends Friday (Victor Lundin) an escaped slave hoping that he will be rescued.

Directed by Byron Haskin (""War of the Worlds""), written by Ib Melchoir (""The Time Travelers"" and ""The Outer Limits"")with John C. Higgins the film has some very good visual effects for its time (and budget). The spaceships of the aliens were recycled from ""War of the Worlds"" (Ib Melchoir hated this feeling that it took you out of the film). Mantee gives a marvelous performance as does Lundin. Also look for a cameo at the beginning by Adam West (""Batman"").

Criterion includes a running commentary combining archival audio tape of Byron Haskin discussing the film along with writer Melchoir, actors Mantee, Lundin and various other participants. Mantee discusses the rigors of shooting on location in Death Valley. He also reveals that originally Lundin was up for his part as Draper. Melchoir talks about the changes on the project when he gave up the directing reins (he went on to direct and write ""The Time Travelers""), the use of the locations he scouted and how he hated the use of the space suits from ""Destination Moon"" which were already looking both outdated and took away impact from the alien miners that had enslaved Friday's people. We get a 20 minute documentary on the film, Mars and the long fascination the Red Planet has held for humanity. There is also a script excerpt than can be viewed/read on your computer and pre-production sketches made for the film. Criterion creates a music video of Lundin's song ""Robinson Crusoe on Mars"" that he has performed at many science fiction conventions. There is also a booklet with a reproduction of Ib Melchoir's notes on a mathematical system for Friday (who was imagined to have only three fingers at the time and also less human looking).

Although the film takes liberties with its science, many of the things shown in the film were pretty accurate at the time and some still hold up quite nicely. Overall, this is an essential film for kids who grew up watching this terrific adventure when they were kids. Criterion has done a top notch job in putting this set together.",1190764800,8,2481,4.846698113207547
2884805,5,B000SFJ4K4,"Okay, well-I guess it's my turn to add a few notes to those that have already reviewed the Criterion Collection's DVD Version of Byron Haskin's ""Robinson Crusoe On Mars.""

From the DVD Notes: ""Robinson Crusoe on Mars is presented in its original Techniscope aspect ratio of 2.35:1. (And formated for 16X9 TV's too.) This new high-definition digital transfer was created on a Rank-Cintel Spirit 4K Datacine from the 35mm 2-perforation A/B interpositive struck from the original negative. Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, and scratches were removed using the MTI Digital Restoration System. To maintain optimal image quality through the compression process, the picture on this dual-layer DVD-9 was encoded at the highest-possible bit rate for the quantity of material included.""

Boy, Is it ever!

I remember seeing this movie as a kid 'many moons' ago in a theatre, and I can tell you that in some instances, it is even better than I remember it. The colors and contrast/brightness of the film are 'spot-on', and of course, you can even discern a little film grain when the visual EFX are added, but it doesn't detract from the film itself.

As far as that part goes, it's *Absolutely Wonderful!*

As a side note, maybe the reason why the Criterion Collection hasn't committed to putting anything on High-Definition DVD's is because there is a format war still in progress, (I'm routing for the 'Blu-Ray' Camp, because the format can hold more information then HD-DVD, and therefore more extras.), but the good thing is that they already have the movies ready when the smoke clears, so I'm waiting right now....

As a matter of fact, Stanley Kubrick's classic ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" should be coming to Blu-Ray sometime fairly soon....so....

My only gripes about 'Robinson Crusoe On Mars' are a few small ones, and they are:

1: As I can recall from the few times that I had seen the movie on TV, and when I saw the movie in the theaters, there was a version that had a anamorphic border on the top and bottom of the screen that consisted of artwork such as the space station from 'Conquest Of Space', a delta-winged spaceship, some various rockets, and a deep sky blue background with stars. For some reason on the new transfer of the film, this film element was omitted, but now that I think about it--it isn't *exactly vital that it should be there,* It just seems a little odd to me that it is missing....

2: (From the DVD Notes): ""The soundtrack was mastered at 24 bit (Better then Compact Disk Audio Quality.) from a 35mil. magnetic full coat (That's the entire surface of the film.) three track master, and audio restoration restoration tools were used to reduce pops, hiss, and crackle.""

That would mean the three track sound rundown would be something like this:

1: Dialogue

2: Sound EFX

3: Music

So-what I'm getting at is--why didn't Criterion have Van Cleave's fantastic music score for the film on a *isolated* track? Sort of what Fox did for Jerry Goldsmith's score for 'Alien' on the DVD Box set. Even Paul Mantee mentions the music score at one time during the commentary track.

They missed out on that one....

Then to others that have put notes here:

R. Monteith: I agree about the cover art....it was more then a bit confusing when I saw it for the first time. Like you mentioned, I would have expected the artwork from the poster art from the film, or at the very least a montage of images taken from the movie like Paul Mantee in a close up wearing his suit-helmet, or Vic Lundin as 'Friday' when we see him for the first time. (Shrugs) I don't get it....

Anyway, I could have got the original 12 inch Laserdisc version had I had a player at the time, and bought the disk when it came out, but by that time, well--it sold out already, was getting to costly....the DVD was coming into it's own, and so I waited....

To Deaftom: Yes, there is a closed captioned track available....I was watching the movie with it on the other day while listening to the commentary track.

In Closing: All things considered however, 'Robinson Crusoe On Mars is (Still) one of my favorites (I'll go as far to typing that it's perhaps one of my 'guilty pleasures' sort of movies.), and to those that have never seen the movie before, you are in for a real treat! Okay, so the information that we had about the surface of Mars at the time is more then a little dated--remember this is back in 1964, but the underlying theme of the movie is still valid today.

Buy it 'tho...you'll like it. :)",1190419200,3,4508,4.652392947103275
2884806,5,B000SFJ4K4,"Any kid of the sixties who saw ""Robinson Crusoe on Mars"" in its brief theatrical run or later on TV, as I did, has never forgotten it.  It's had a minor cult following for over forty years now.  So, it's wonderful for fans of this minor SF classic that it finally arrives, nearly a decade after the format debuted, on DVD, and in a stunningly clean 16x9 anamorphic transfer of the original 35mm Techniscope negative.  I'm sure this movie hasn't looked this good since its first theatrical showings in late June 1964, and probably even looks better now, and I can't believe any fan of it that owns a widescreen display isn't going to be just about floored with the picture on this DVD.

If you have any interest in the movie, I highly recommend getting this disc, however, that said, I can't help but state that I'm more than a little disappointed by this release.  That's because the company that's made it, Criterion, put this title out thirteen years ago in one of the most beautiful laserdisc packages ever.  The movie was recorded in the then superior CAV format that took up two discs and spread the movie across four sides.  Taking it out to play it on your laserdisc player was something of an event, and the discs were housed in a colorful gatefold jacket that reproduced the original poster art.  The extras also included the kind of curios, such as the audio from a promotional song put out on a 45rpm record from the original campaign and the reminiscences of a film collector who saw the movie in its first release, that made the thing really special to fans and, sadly, haven't been retained here.  The excellent commentary track done for the laserdisc has been reproduced, as have most of the extras, but I was hoping for some updated comments from the surviving stars, and there isn't any.  They don't even appear in a new featurette created for this DVD.

The older transfer has of course been superseded, but the charm of that previous release hasn't been recaptured, with a DVD packaged in a clear plastic case with new cover art and an ugly booklet that are as cold as a Martian night.  It's puzzling that as many home video companies, such as Warners and Fox, are finally starting to realize that film buffs love original poster art used on the DVD covers of their favorite movies, Criterion, a pioneer in the proper appreciation of films on video, has moved in exactly the opposite direction, giving us some of the ugliest covers in the industry.  I suspect, since Criterion has to license the films it releases from others, that a further fee to use the original advertising materials is simply prohibitive.  If so, too bad.

So, while I'm very happy to finally have ""Robinson Crusoe on Mars"" in a superb transfer on DVD, I get none of the excitement and appreciation I had from the 1994 laserdisc presentation.  I never thought in 1994 I'd one day be nostalgic for that year, but in this respect I very much am.  DVDs are nice, but sometimes they just don't have the panache of the old laserdiscs.",1190332800,,3020,4.594040968342644
2884807,5,B000SFJ4K4,"In short, this special edition DVD is what the fans of this film have been waiting for. Criterion put obvious effort into a great package of extras, especially for a film of this age. Of particular note is a fairly extensive selection of production art, ranging from quick concept sketches to expertly rendered storyboards, even a bit of tantalizing art from a sadly-unrealized sequel-of-sorts, ""Columbus of the Stars.""

The commentaries from stars Paul Mantee and Victor Lundin, writer Ib Melchior, designer Al Nozaki and historian Robert Skotak (all recorded separately but interwoven effectively into a single track) are also very good. There's even some archival tape recordings of director Byron Haskin sprinkled in (hard to hear, but interesting). Mantee's commentary is probably the most engaging as he recounts his experiences as a young Method actor coming up against old-school Hollywood philosophy, his fond recollections of his Wooly Monkey co-star, on-set anecdotes and much more.

The ""Destination Mars"" featurette, while not about the production itself, is surprisingly interesting as it looks at how the film fits with the realities of what we now know about Mars and the potential for getting there. The trailer is in good shape, and the ""music video"" from Victor Lundin -- well, you'll definitely want to watch it -- once.

For those like myself who've only experienced this movie in its usual pan-and-scan TV broadcasts, you're in for a real treat with the full widescreen treatment here. The print is immaculate, the sound is clear and robust even though it's in its original monaural format. There's also a nice booklet (no photos unfortunately, but lots of them on the disc itself). The menus are also nicely designed and easy to navigate. Special mention should be made of the beautiful new cover art created by the great illustrator Bill Sienkiewicz. Basically there's not much to dislike about this fine edition!",1190160000,6,1937,5.182108626198083
2884808,5,B000SFJ4K4,"During all those late nights my brother and I would stay up catching great old movies like this, I would have never dreamed I'd one day be able to own this almost-forgotten classic, and in such a deluxe format.  There may be more high-profile sixties sci-fi films, but almost none of them achieve the level of sophistication and technical prowess of Robinson Crusoe on Mars.

The film is, of course, a space-age variation on the classic Robinson Crusoe survival tale.  Paul Mantee is the lone U.S. astronaut who gets stranded--along with Mona the Monkey--on the Red Planet.  While struggling to survive a hostile alien environment, Mantee realizes he's not quite alone on Mars.  I don't want to give away any more plot details, because you really need to see this classic film yourself.

The print is virtually flawless, and the bright reds of the Martian landscape almost leap off the screen.

Extras: There's a great (and long) theatrical trailer, an informative  documentary which discusses the science of Robinson Crusoe on Mars, a Criterion-produced music video for the well-intentioned (though sonically hideous) song ""Robinson Crusoe on Mars"" by co-star Victor Lundin, and alternate audio commentary from two of the film's stars and screenwriter Ib Melchoir.

Robinson Crusoe on Mars certainly belongs in any classic sci-fi fan's collection.  And it's unlikely that anyone will ever improve upon this first-class job by Criterion.  Highly recommended.",1190073600,9,1855,5.876865671641791

I'd like to give it 4-5 stars based on others' reviews, but as long as Paramount doesn't give a damn about people like me, it's going to have to get a low rating.

Update: This video does indeed have subtitles, although that information was not available at the time.

That adventure is grandly represented by this wonderful film, which allowing for a few flaws in the plot, does at least attempt to present the story with some scientific merit and plausible ideas.

The cinematography is excellent!  The stark, desolate landscape is both thrilling and chilling in it's magnificent but achingly isolated beauty.  The lead actor, Paul Mantee, does a fine job of conveying the loneliness and edge of insanity mindset that comes from being in a situation of despair and solitude.

Also, Adam West, the guy who played Batman on the 1960s TV series, was killed off at the beginning of the film. Too bad. RCOM is one of the best ""survival on an alien planet"" films and, for its time, was pretty realistic. However dumb the Friday character was (I've seen him elsewhere, but don't remember where - he looks like a Russian). Anyway, those in the know understand that the real hero of the film is MONA!!!

I used to watch it all the time on TV as a kid, and I still love it now. As the title suggests, this 1964 sci-fi classic is the ""Robinson Crusoe"" story set on Mars, with the tale of one astronaut's survival on an alien world. Like ""2001,"" ""Forbidden Planet,"" ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" and ""Solaris"" (the original ""Solaris,"" NOT the god-awful remake with George Clooney), ""Robinson Crusoe On Mars"" is an *intelligent* sci-fi movie. It's well-written, beautifully shot, expertly directed by Byron Haskin, and acted quite strongly by a very effective trio of actors: Paul Mantee as the stranded astronaut, Victor Lundin as the alien whom our hero names Friday, and Adam West (of ""Batman"" fame) as a fellow astronaut (even though West's role is basically a cameo). And the movie also features THE most adorable little monkey in the history of cinema, Mona. I'm absolutely delighted to see this sci-fi classic get the DVD treatment at last. And the fact that it's being put out by Criterion is even better! (They also did a marvelous job with ""Solaris"" too, I must admit.)

I own the long cherished laser disc version of this film and have always yearned for a great digital transfer. As of this date the dvd hasn't been released yet so I cant comment on the picture quality. I would definetly say this though; why put it out on standard dvd? Today and tomorrow are all about HD. This movie would be a perfect candidate for HD. Yet, films like Norbit are released on Blu ray. Why bother! The film(RC on Mars) even on laser disc looks nice, so HD would be mind boggling. The special effects which are dated do not distract from the storyline and the movie develops great interest from the viewer.
  Adam West has a good film presence, and I've always been surprised that he never went much further then TVs Batman. The Martian landscape is very realistic looking and the acting is on the mark all around. Landing on an alien world with a plot that adds the right twists and turns is laid out neatly in a gladly not forgotten gem. Criterion did miss the boat by not going full throttle with an HD release. Anyone interested in the film will only be forced to buy it again when HD prevails in a few years. Remember, ""In living color"" on old tv shows? It was so new and unique. We laugh at that now.

The Transfer:

""Robinson Crusoe on Mars is presented in its original Techniscope aspect ratio of 2.35:1. Black bars at the top and bottom of the screen are normal for this format. This new high-definition digital transfer was created on a Spirit 4K Datacine from the 35mm 2-perforation A/B interpositive struck from the original negative. Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, and scratches were removed using the MTI Digital Restoration System. To maintain optimal image quality through the compression process, the picture on this dual-layer DVD-9 was encoded at the highest-possible bit rate for the quantity of material included.

The soundtrack was mastered at 24-bit from a 35mm magnetic full coat master three track, and audio restoration tools were used to reduce clicks, pops, hiss, and crackle. The Dolby Digital 1.0 signal will be directed to the center channel on surround sound systems, but some viewers may prefer to switch to two-channel playback for a wider dispersal of the mono sound.""

2884835,4,B000SFJ4K4,"A plausible science fiction adventure that is played dead serious (no comic sidekicks). No major technical flaws to annoy us technical types other than assuming Mars is a little warmer and has an almost breathable atmosphere. A fairly simple plot based loosely on the original Robinson Crusoe. Watch for low budget reuse of spaceships from the 1953 version of ""War of the Worlds"".",1140134400,11,380,5.0476190476190474

8205236,5,B000SFJ4K4,My favorite movie as a child.  I tried finding this on DVD for years.  It became a real brain teaser.  Began to think I imagined this whole movie.  Found it on Amazon and now have it forever.  Great story line and well produced. Adam West from the TV show Batman makes an appearance.  The suspense of this Si-Fi drama even had me on the edge of my seat @ 60 years old.  Highly recommend for us old dudes who grew up in the late 50's and early 60's.,1519171200,,448,4.0227272727272725
8205237,5,B000SFJ4K4,"One of my favorite sci-fi movies ever.  Creative and different, with few fancy special effects, which is a good thing.  The acting and realistic survival aspect of it make it a worthwhile watch, which I do at least once a year.",1518739200,,227,4.512195121951219
