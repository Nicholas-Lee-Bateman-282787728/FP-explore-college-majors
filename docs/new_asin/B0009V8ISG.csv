8067269,2,B0009V8ISG,"The Alpha Incident  is all about a Martian virus that comes to Earth.  We don't really know how or why (one summary says the Mars probe brought it back, but I must have missed that line in the movie) we just know that the govt. has it, and par for the course, an accident during transit causes an outbreak.  The outbreak is small, though, only affecting a handful of people in a secluded location.

A single govt. agent must control the infected populace.  Its his mandate to keep them quarantined whether they want to be or not, and hell use lethal force to do it; yet hes also doing all he can to keep them alive so that when the boys back at the lab come up with a cure everybody can get fixed up and go home.

Falling asleep is lethal. That's when the virus sets in moving unspeakably fast and causing gruesome damage.  Lack of sleep can mess with the minds of a group of people that don't necessarily like each other in the first place and are cooped up against their will.  Can they possibly stay awake long enough to get cured?  Can they stay sane with so little sleep?

The movie is primarily the victims story - the struggle of innocent civilians vs. a lone agent just trying to do his job for control of the situation: what little control there is to be had that is.  We do get a peek at the characters of the scientists working on the study of the virus, but they never develop much and feel underused even after what feels like a promise for more.  Seeing more of them might have been interesting.

The movie does several things right.  Its doesnt follow typical conventions. The characters don't feel stereotypical yet don't feel so different that I feel like the writers are trying too hard.  The story as a whole doesnt necessarily go in the direction you might expect.  Not that its anything you haven't seen before, theres far too much out there for this to be unique, but at the same time it doesnt play out like a dime a dozen movie either.

One potential complaint is that the surprise ending feels too rushed as if the director wanted to spring it on us for shock effect without being able to make it completely satisfying.  The subplot with the scientists fizzles, and theres not enough of a mood established for the final events.  More aftermath would have helped.

Acting is pretty decent.  There are some moments that don't feel completely natural, but for the most part the actors made me believe they were the characters they were portraying.  This helps when the pace gets slow.

And get slow it does.  There are moments of tension and suspense, but theres also a lot of time spent watching the people trying to keep themselves awake by doing things like playing cards which doesnt provide a whole lot of excitement.

Atmosphere is probably what the movie is most lacking in.  I did enjoy watching the characters, but might have really gotten pulled into the story with a darker, more X Files-y atmosphere about it.

Content:
Violence is infrequent, but we do see splattered mouse brains and a grotesque human death. Theres some sexual suggestion, brief nudity, and a fair amount of strong language.

DVD:
I have this movie in two 50 movie mega-packs: Fright Classics and Chilling Classics.  The transfers are virtually identical.  The quality is like a poor VHS copy.  The audio isn't that good although at least all the dialogue is clearly understandable.  Theres a bothersome hum at times. Video is pixilated and unclear.  Worse than that is a strange haze around the edges for most of the movie.  This gets highly annoying. There are no extras for either set.

I cant find any other DVD editions that look more promising than these.

 FINAL THOUGHTS:
This was actually an enjoyable movie.  If only it had a stronger atmosphere...  I want to give it 3*, but its going to lose a star for the poor presentation quality, primarily the edge haze and hum.  I would reconsider letting that affect the rating as much if it weren't present in 2 different editions of the movie which leads me to believe its going to be there no matter where you see it.  For that reason it gets 2*.",1496620800,,4104,4.529251700680272
8067270,3,B0009V8ISG,"A probe returns from Mars. It brings with it a little something. It looks like the flue but acts very gory. A nosy railroad employee takes a peak and we get a movie. The bulk of the movie is ""How would you act if faced with eminent dispatch?""

Low budget and a tad of gratuitous mammalian exposure, could have been entitled ""How to pick up sleazy women.""

Meanwhile what is the virus up to? And the sneaky cabal of government people; do you think they have a good solution to the situation?

Well enjoy the film for what it is. Cringe once in a while and cheer when it is over.",1419033600,,577,4.18018018018018
8067271,3,B0009V8ISG,"A number of movies have covered the subject of diseases, viruses, parasites, etc. infecting unwary or deliberately stupid people.  If you think about it, movies about diseases are hard to make as action movies, because a person is infected, they are sick for a while, and then they recover or they die.  In the meantime, there is a lot of sitting around and waiting for something to happen.  Unless you can fill up the intermediate space with something interesting, the movie can, and this one does, get boring quickly.

This movie primarily takes place in two general locations.  The first location is what appears to be a government laboratory where mysterious tests have been performed on a deadly virus brought back from space.  Scenes from the laboratory are interspersed throughout the movie in an apparent attempt to heighten the tension.  The other location is a train depot in the middle of nowhere.  I wondered, briefly, why anyone was at the train depot, since not much seemed to happen there, unless you count the release of deadly alien viruses.

Now that you have the background, I can get you to the meat of the movie.  The government laboratory was testing a virus brought back from space.  Why were they testing it?  Probably to find out how deadly it was.  It was apparently so deadly that they decide to transport the virus to a secure location in Colorado.  Unfortunately, the train on which they transported the virus was not secure.  One rather foolish and nosy person attempts to find out what the government agent is transporting, and is unsuccessful.  When the agent falls asleep, the foolish individual opens the container and (of course, or we would have no movie) breaks the vial holding the virus, simultaneously cutting himself.  There is no need to wonder who must be infected by the virus.

The government agent discovers the container is open and the vial is broken, and quickly sets things into motion to quarantine everyone at the train depot in the middle of nowhere, which helps cut down the cost of adding more cast.  The scientists at the government laboratory try to figure out how to cure the virus while everyone at the train depot sits around and talks for an hour.  Well, it was longer than an hour in movie time, but it was about an hour in actual time.

The real heart of this movie is following what the characters do while waiting for what seems to be almost certain doom.  The characters talk, dance, try to escape, party down, drink, make love, and die periodically, by self-infliction, virus, or sheer boredom.  All this leads to the exciting climax of the movie, which I will not reveal (though others have - no plot spoiler in this review).  The movie then ends abruptly.

I enjoyed the 1971 version of ""The Andromeda Strain.""  Yes, that movie has its boring points, but it emphasizes science over fiction.  Guess what?  A lot of science involves experimenting, testing, and experimenting some more, which is what ""The Andromeda Strain"" shows.  In this movie, we get feeble attempts at trying to inject some science into the fiction, but then we end up back at the train depot with a bunch of mostly forgettable characters.

Now, I could absolutely trash this movie and say it is worthless, but that is not completely true.  I like to be entertained by movies, and this one was not very entertaining - to me.  However, if you think you would like to watch a movie about people who know that they are likely to die, and they can do little about it, then you may find this movie interesting.  From that perspective, the movie is somewhat like a character study.  Unfortunately, I thought the characters were mostly stereotypical.  I had a difficult time relating to any of them and an even harder time caring whether they lived or died.  It seems like this movie could have been much more than it ended up being.

It seems that it is difficult to create good science fiction movies.  I suspect the reason is that science is generally boring for non-scientists.  Most of the time the goal of scientists is to make something happen, and observe.  Even the best science fiction movies have places that seem boring because that often happens when scientists are around.  If that was the focus for this movie, I might have a different opinion.  Since the primary focus seemed to be watching a group of people disintegrate in advance of impending doom, or being affected by that doom, it was not very interesting to me.

Good luck!",1344902400,,4476,4.7212903225806455
8067272,4,B0009V8ISG,"A low budget rip-off of the Andromeda Strain, the Alpha Incident is one of the better films to come from 1970s B-movie director Bill Rebane.  The film deals with a group of strangers who, after possibly being exposed to an alien virus, are quarantined in a station house.  As they struggle to maintain their sanity as they wait to discover whether or not they've been infected, the U.S. military plots to make the quarantine permanent.

The Alpha Incident isn't for everyone.  The low budget is obvious, some of the acting is rather wooden (but some of it is surprisingly good as well), and Bill Rebane never quite overcomes the staginess of the material.  However, if you're a fan of 70s exploitation cinema, The Alpha Incident is a must see because this film represents everything that we love about those old B-movies.  Yes, director Rebane had more ambition than resources but the important thing is that he had the ambition and, even without all the CGI and spectacle that we now take for granted, he still managed to do a fairly good job of fulfilling those ambitions.  Add to that, the whole film ends on one of those wonderfully downbeat notes that were so typical of 70s cinema but which few directors have the guts to try today.  The Alpha Incident is, in many ways, a relic of a past age and I guess that's why I enjoyed it and recommend it.",1326326400,2,1352,4.580912863070539

8067274,3,B0009V8ISG,"I bought this at a book store.  I saw that it had Ralph Meeker in it so I figured I would give it a shot.  I blame the director for this movie.  It actually had a decent plot and on occasion the actors would deliver lines pretty well, but the acting overall was not very good.  I think with better acting or better directing of the ones used, this could have been a very good film.  The ""twist"" at the end I saw coming way in advance and was no surprise at all.  Ralph Meeker, the only 'name' in the cast barely did anything and really had the smallest part of all the cast. For a while I wondered if his character was even able to speak.  As the hero, Stafford Morgan did an okay, 1960ish job.  George 'Buck' Flower could have been great.  He had a nice part but was just not very good.  Carol Newell began the film as the nice lady in the train station then for some reason I could not fathom just went into slut mode.  Ralph Meeker, Carol Newell and a couple other minor name stars could have made this one good film to watch.  As it was, I enjoyed it but it could have been so much more.",1279584000,,1091,4.023255813953488
8067275,3,B0009V8ISG,"This is about a mysterious infectious agent, that of course escapes - in Alaska, through which it was being transported on its way to a bio-facility.  There is a group quarantined, so it is a kind of character study.  Left to themselves, they interact in strange ways, waiting and hoping for a cure, freaking out to put it mildly.  It is really scary, at least for me, as I always feared this kind of alien contamination in scifi when I was growing up.

Very much like Andromeda Strain, but much much darker.  The actors are a bit amateurish, but not so bad.

8067276,2,B0009V8ISG,"A deadly micro-organism from Mars is unleashed on mankind! Sounds exciting right? Well.... THE ALPHA INCIDENT just doesn't have the time, talent, or budget to fulfill any hopes of showing a superplague conquering the planet. Instead, we get five people -a government stooge, a secretary, her boss, Charlie (Ralph Meeker), and a couple of hicks- trapped at a train depot after one of them releases the alien virus. Now, in the right hands, even this could have made for a pulse-pounding drama. Forget it! One of the hayseeds runs off when he finds out he's infected. We never see him again. The remaining four sit around chatting. This goes on for about a century. They are told they cannot fall asleep or they will die. So, they have a party! At one point the secretary decides to have sex w/ the remaining hillbilly in a nearby boxcar. More chatting. Meanwhile, scientists at a secret lab debate philosophical issues while working on a cure. Still more chatting. Uh-oh! Charlie falls asleep! His head splits open, his eyeballs bulge, and his brain rolls out of his head! Now we're getting somewhere! No more chatting! Hooray! The secretary shoots herself in order to escape the same fate. The mountain-man gasps and hits the floor. The government guy falls asleep. He wakes up to find himself alive and unscathed. He's immune to the bug! He must tell the world! BANG! He's shot dead by other government operatives in hazmat suits. THE END. If you must watch this, I recommend seeing the first 30 minutes, then skipping to the final ten. You won't miss much...",1129075200,3,1560,4.781481481481482
