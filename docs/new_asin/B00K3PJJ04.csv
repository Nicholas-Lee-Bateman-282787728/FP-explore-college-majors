I am not a dancer so I will have to study it a few times to feel like I can get the moves, but Ilyse breaks it down into sections. It was really fun and not too long so you feel like you can get through it.  I read about a celebrity taking classes with Ilyse and crediting her great figure to the dance classes.  I bought it for my 14 year old daughter for Christmas, but I broke the seal while the kids were at school.  She will love it; I am sure.",1420588800,,527,3.772727272727273
