7800658,5,1629973106,Little expensive but very good lecture series presented by an engaging and knowledgeable teacher.  Not a quick way to learn a tai chi form but detailed information that would be of great value to an experienced tai chi player.  Quality product.  You'll learn something with this series.,1522540800,,286,5.042553191489362
7800659,5,1629973106,"Every moment I viewed these videos was time well spent.  This is an outstanding course on Tai Chi which has increased my spiritual balance as well as heightened awareness of my own body.  I liked learning from these videos because I could go back and review the movements when I felt like a refresher was needed.  I took my time and progressed through the entire course in about four months with about 20 minutes of daily practice.  My primary athletic discipline is the sport of running and track and field and I can attest that my body awareness improved and will continue to improve via a daily practice of Tai Chi.  In addition, as a track and field coach I believe that some basic movements from this course can be implemented into a conditioning program.  Mr. Ross has a very positive and upbeat teaching style that I think fits in nicely within the spirit of Tai Chi.",1510099200,2,874,4.535031847133758
