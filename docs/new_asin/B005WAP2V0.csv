4898651,5,B005WAP2V0,"Update.  11/30/11.  Last week,  on my flight back to San Francisco, I watched a program about the making of The Guard, which has become the highest grossing Irish made movie ever at the Irish box office grossing 4.3 million Euros, beating the previous best, The wind That Shakes  The Barley, starring Cillian Murphy.  To put this this in an American context, it's about $1.50 for every man, woman and child in the country.

Michael John McDonagh previously wrote the screenplay for Ned Kelly starring Heath Ledger which I remember as a good movie.  His brother Martin has won an Academy Award nomination, for Best Original Screenplay for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-Bruges/dp/B0018BD9DA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In Bruges</a>, which also starred Brendan Gleeson, and what I consider the best performance of Colin Farrell's career, and an Academy award for the short feature Six Shooter,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Collection-of-2005-Academy-Award-Nominated-Short-Films/dp/B000FSMEDS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Collection of 2005 Academy Award Nominated Short Films</a>, also starring Brendan Gleeson, and at least two other characters you will see in The Guard, written and directed by MJ.

As the movie begins we see Gerry Boyle, the guard played by BG, in his white squad car parked behind a stone wall, when a red car whizzes by.  He does not respond to the speeding car.  His response to what happens next, has no words, yet it establishes the nature of the character, as he rummages through pockets, and does something with the drugs.  We can deduce that here is a guard that does not follow the established rules, and in fact may even be corrupt.

Next we see him responding to a murder scene.  Here we get a truer sense of his character by how he acts around the new cop who will be his partner. Here the comedic tone of the movie gets established.  He likes to push buttons and get a reaction.  They theorise about the murder, a potted plant placed on the victim's crotch, the significance of the number 5 1/2 painted on the wall.  Perhaps he was the 5 1/2th victim, the young one theorises.

Like another reviewer I was struck by the parallels with the Coen Brothers, particularly Fargo, and No Country For Old Men.  Instead of the barren landscapes of Minnesota, and the quirky Nordic accents of Minnesotans, we have the bog landscape of the Wesht of Ireland, and the quirks and mores of the locals.  We have sociopathic criminals.  We also have the quirky Spaghetti Western music, reinforcing the ironic tone.  We also have a trace of Ryan's Daughter, and a half cracked young lad on a bike, who mirrors John Hurt's character in that movie. We have murderous criminals who debate their favorite philosophers as they drive along.

So, strait laced, by the book FBI agent Wendell Evers played by Don Cheadle, moseys into town, hot on the trail of an international smuggling ring hoping to land half a billion dollars worth of drugs in Ireland.  Instantly, this sets up a culture clash, with Boyle making racially insensitive comments. When rebuked, his response. ""I'm Irish. Racism is part of our culture.""

When Boyle is by himself he wanders his house in his red or yellow y fronts scratching. He does not seem like a brilliant cop.  However, not following the book, opens up levels of resourcefulness for him.  Guards don't carry firearms in Ireland, yet in a prescient way he manages to acquire weapons, donating the balance to the local IRA man who wears a cowboy hat.  With his seeming amorality, you wonder if when push comes to shove, he will back off and let the criminals do their thing or if he will intervene.

Perhaps my favorite scene, the second derringer scene, reminiscent of similar scenes at the beginning of Inglorious Basterds, and final scene with Woody Harrelson in No Country for Old Men.  Life and death hangs in the balance.

Boyle tells Evers he came fourth in swimming in the Olympics, which made me search the internet after the movie. The answer may surprise you.

Another theme is the nihilism, which is that events have no inherent meaning, a consistent theme in several Coen Brothers movies.

For non Irish speakers, our FBI detective attempts at one point to interview some Irish speaking people.  In speech they refer to him as fear gorm, which the subtitle translates as black man.  The word gorm actually means blue.  If you were saying it literally, it would be fear dubh (pronounced far duhve).

I know that some people claim that they cannot understand foreign accents. Where on earth do you hear more foreign accents than in North America on a daily basis?  If I walk the streets of San Francisco, I will hear German, English, Chinese, Filipino, Mexican, South American, you name it.  So, we have Oprah Winfrey, or Sigourney Weaver, narrating BBC produced documentaries because producers think customers cannot discern an English accent.  The English in this movie is well spoken with a slight accent.  West may be pronounced Wesht, just like Sean Connery doesn't say accent, he says ackshent.  Even Schwarzenegger was not the governor of California, he was the governor of Callie phone ee yeah.

I saw this at Robert Redford's Sundance Theater in San Francisco. It was an afternoon show, and the political incorrectness, and several American pop culture references, and fun poking commments resonated with the audience.

If you wish to see Brendan Gleeson in another movie, I recommend John Boorman's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-General/dp/0767833600/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The General</a>, where he plays Martin Cahill based on a real life Irish gangster.

So, I loved this movie.  I think most people will feel the same way, and I think we have seen a great new talent with Michael John McDonagh, in a very impressive first outing as director.  It's clear that talent runs in this family, and perhaps they see parallels between themselves as brothers, and the Coen Brothers.  I don't think such a comparison is grandiose, and I wonder if they will work together on future projects.  I believe that 'genius, in order to be emulated, must first be imitated.'

I think you will love it, and I hope this was helpful.  Thank you.",1315440000,49,6336,5.151663405088063

The scenes between the mother and son are near perfection, especially the last between the characters, capturing the characters, the culture, and two great actors, making it look easy. The bad guys are smarter than usual, yet still make dumb mistakes. This movie surprised in all the good ways a movie could. Don't let it get by. Laugh out loud with the audience, that doesn't happen much anymore.",1315353600,2,449,4.8441558441558445
4898653,5,B005WAP2V0,"The Guard, a small independent film from Ireland written and directed by John Michael McDonagh, is something of a gem.  On the surface, it could fall into any number of the usual categories - crime drama, fish-out-of-water story, odd couple forced to work together buddy flick - but none of those labels would do it proper justice.  The closest thing I can truly compare it to is the Coen brothers' film Fargo.  Like Fargo, The Guard deals with a homicide in a quiet rural area (in this case coastal Ireland instead of Minnesota) being investigated by the local authority (in this case an idiosyncratic Garda - Irish policeman - instead of a highly pregnant sheriff).  But also like Fargo, what makes the film truly interesting is the character studies that unfold as we see both sides - the police and the criminals - going about their missions.

And in a final comparison to Fargo and to Coen brothers films in general, the dialogue is frequently priceless. At the film's center is the guard of the title, Sergeant Gerry Boyle (Brendan Gleeson), an Irish policeman stationed in the district of Connemara on the western coast of Ireland.  In the opening scene, where Boyle witnesses a car accident on a rural road where some local youths are killed, we quickly learn three things about Boyle - very little ever rattles him, he's definitely more attuned to the spirit of the law than the letter, and he's far from being above the occasional bit of self indulgence.  Shortly after that, when he's investigating an apparent murder and having to break in a new partner, Aidan McBride (Rory Keenan) at the same time, we learn something else about Boyle: he delights in being a crude, rude, pain in the ass to just about everyone, deliberately goading or provoking people just to see how they'll react.

The plot deepens when an American FBI agent, Wendell Everett (Don Cheadle) shows up, tracking an international drug-smuggling operation who's rumored to be in the district planning a drop, and it turns out that Boyle's murder victim is connected to the drug gang. From that point things quickly become a tangle of murder, bribery, blackmail and deception as Boyle and Everett try to close in on the gang before the drop can be pulled off and the gang in turn does everything they can to get the two out of the way so that they can make their pick-up without interference.

But it's the characters and their interactions along the way that really drive The Guard and make it a cut above the usual crime drama fare. Gleeson's Boyle is a delight to watch - alternating between charming and sensitive one moment and poke-in-the-eye offensive the next - and you can tell Gleeson is having a lot of fun playing him, like when a freckle-faced boy asks him what a derringer he found is for and Boyle replies ""It's for shooting small Protestants."" A touching sub-plot reveals yet another side to Boyle. His mother, Eileen (marvelously played by Fionnula Flanagan) is in a local hospice, apparently with some form of terminal cancer. The scenes between mother and son are both darkly funny and moving, and you can see where Boyle gets his life-on-my-terms approach to things.

Don Cheadle's by-the-book straight-laced Everett is the straight man to many of Boyle's jabs but he handles the role well, managing to be funny without being ridiculous. One great scene comes when Everett finally sees through Boyle's ""Ugly Irishman"" game and Boyle realizes it and just grins, the exchange all through facial expressions.  Another great scene has Everett tromping through the Connemara countryside trying to question residents who refuse to speak to him in anything but Gaelic (translated in subtitles so that you know what they're saying while Everett does not, adding to the comic effect).

The members of the drug gang - two Irishmen, Francis Sheehy (Liam Cunningham) and Liam O'Leary (David Wilmot), and an Englishman, Clive Cornell (a stand-out performance by Mark Strong) - are particularly engaging in their scenes. Like one where they're driving along killing time debating the merits of various philosophers based on nationality, or another where they're in a local aquarium and Cornell is staring thoughtfully at the glass and comments ""I like sharks. They're... soothing."" Or yet another where Cornell delivers a pay-off and flies into a devastatingly sarcastic rant when asked if the money's all there.  Other characters add to the color, including a cowboy-hat wearing IRA man embarrassed over a missing cache of weapons, a pale-faced camera-flashing local youth who apparently has a fetish for crime scenes, a pint-sized boy disappointed that Cheadle's FBI man isn't with the Behavioral Science Unit he's seen on TV (apparently the only thing that's going to impress anyone in the district), and a couple of cheery uniformed prostitutes who liven up Boyle's day off.

About the only cautions I would mention are that the accents - Irish and English - are a bit on the thick side, and the ending does involve one ambiguous outcome. It's well set up and you could come down on either side of it, but it's deliberately left unclear.

Other than that though, I highly recommend The Guard as a film well worth catching and John Michael McDonagh as a writer/director worth following.",1314748800,71,5273,4.908988764044944
4898654,5,B005WAP2V0,"John Michael McDonagh's ""The Guard"" proves that both talent and attitude run in the McDonagh family. Like the work of his more famous brother, Martin McDonagh, John Michael's debut film combines familiar crime-story themes with a malicious, anarchic wit that is Irish through and through. If Quentin Tarantino ever collaborated with Roddy Doyle, the resulting movie would be a lot like the work of the McDonagh brothers.

""Thr Guard"" tells the story of Sgt. Gerry Boyle of the Galway Police (Brendan Gleeson), a cop who plays by no known rules. He steals and ingests drugs from dead perps, patronizes hookers who oblige him by dressing up as policewomen, and regularly sasses his superiors. ""I'm Irish--racism is part of my culture,"" he says when ordered to apologize for making insensitive remarks to Wendell Everett (Don Cheadle), a visiting African-American FBI agent.

Everett is in Ireland to chase down a group of murderous drug smugglers. When Boyle's new partner goes missing, he and Everett must work together to solve the mystery and capture the smugglers. If you're expecting a replay of ""Lethal Weapon,"" forget it. McDonagh is far too cynical and worldly-wise to go in for happy endings and buddy cliches. McDonagh reveals, very casually, that Boyle's superiors are corrupt and trying to misdirect Everett. In an American film, the corrupt cops would all be hauled away in handcuffs at the end; in ""The Guard,"" it gives away nothing to reveal that nothing happens to them. Life goes on, the way it always has. But Boyle--cut from the same cloth as his superiors, but refusing to play by their rules--is uniquely able to get to the bottom of the mystery, precisely because he expects no good to come from any of it.

As Boyle, Gleeson gives one of the truly great comic performances of the last decade, on a par with the ones he gave for Martin McDonagh in ""Six Shooter"" and ""In Bruges."" He and Cheadle have wonderful screen chemistry. I only wish that the character of Everett hadn't been so bland as written. Cheadle is incapable of giving a dull performance, but McDonagh's writing shows far less understanding of American cops than of Irish ones. Nevertheless, there are excellent performances all around. As Boyle's dying mother, Fionnula Flanagan is flat-out wonderful, showing the same disabused view of the world as her son. Liam Cunningham, Mark Strong and David Wilmot are a stitch as the smugglers; in the midst of their psychotic crimes, they take time out to debate whether Nietzsche or Bertrand Russell was the greater philosopher. Gorgeously photographed, wryly witty and well-paced, ""The Guard"" is a delightful surprise and a sardonic treat.",1314662400,10,2668,5.018058690744921

I had to give it a three stars even though it has some great actors such as Cheadle , Gleeson, and Strong.  I feel it needed a bigger production and to make it big in Hollywood.

This movie has had surprisingly high ratings, and I cannot for the life of me understand why. If it was supposed to be a comedy, it was unfunny. If it was supposed to be an actioner, there was no action. If it was supposed to be a drama, I didn't care about any of the characters.

Don Cheadle is great in the straight role as the polished FBI agent (""I'll have you know I come from a very privileged background"").
Mark Strong, Liam Cunningham and David Wilmot have enormous fun playing the villains. And there's a very touching cameo from Fionnula Flanagan as Sgt. Boyle's mother.
The dark humour and Gleeson's anchoring role are reminiscent of ""In Bruges"", (which was made by the director's brother Martin McDonagh). ""The Guard"" is played for laughs more than ""In Bruges"", but I like it almost as much.

The lighting and cinematography is also great in this as the detail can be seen even in the darker night scenes- unlike many movies made in the 2000s where it's like staring at a screen so dark you feel you're looking at an ink blot in some movies.  I realize it's done on purpose but feel it's a mistake since film is a visual medium as much as dialogue, and once a scene is lit or colored too darkly you might as well be listening to a cd or an old radio show.  You won't find that problem here; in addition to engaging characters we're treated tosome really panoramic scenery here too.

We are introduced to Officer Gerry Boyle (Brendan Gleeson), a racist Irish cop who enjoys drinking on the beat and giving his subordinate grief. When a seemingly innocent homicide turns out to be something much deeper and darker, Boyle teams up with FBI Agent Wendel Everett (Don Cheadle) and they try to get to the bottom of it.

Those who have a patient, sharp, and--yes--dark sense of humor, the Guard is a great fit. Gleeson and Cheadle unite as the most unlikely but charming of companions.

4898808,4,B005WAP2V0,"I think some groups of people might like this movie a lot more than others.  I am female and was watching with 2 guys.  One of them likes edgy, subversive movies.  This movie was absolutely perfect for him.  I also liked it, but not at first.  The main character is blatantly racist/bigoted, rude, sleeps with prostitutes, and says the f-word in every sentence.  The whole point of the movie is to look past that, and the movie was successful at making me care about the main character and enjoy the movie (after the first bit).

I have mixed feelings about this message. It's the Curious George trope: it doesn't matter how much trouble you cause as long as you heroically save the day in the end.  It's the lovable, rude, unlikely,  badass.  It reminds me of the doctor on House.  People who like that kind of character will love this movie.

4898812,3,B005WAP2V0,"There has been a rich history of great films and terrible flicks about law enforcement officials who are
unconventional--maybe overzealous. Start with the Keystone Cops, suffer through an onslaught of Police
Academy movies as well as one too many Beverly Hills Cop attempts. And the fun doesn't stop there.
More recent iterations of the cops for yucks patrol include Kevin James in Mall Cop and Seth Rogen in
Observe and Report. Both admittedly pretty bad (although I did drowsily sit through Mall Cop after renting
it for a dollar from one of those red grocery store boxes--not so bad when you're really not that invested in
it). Oh, and let's not forget the Reno 911! series--or maybe let's do forget--another ill-conceived, trashy
spoof.
The Guard is unlike any of those police farces, and is well worth the search as you're not going to find it in
many local theaters. The film stars Brendon Gleeson, notorious character actor, as a police Sergeant
Gerry Boyle in County Galway, Ireland. Gleeson was born to play this role, perfectly cast as a cop who is
unorthodox to say the least. It's not beyond Boyle's standard to pop or snort confiscated contraband now
and then. Another wonderful actor, Don Cheadle, plays opposite Gleeson as FBI agent Wendell Everett
trying to stop a smuggling ring making its way through the port of Boyle's town.
Sure, Boyle is the garden variety loud mouth lout, not unlike the Peter Griffen character in Family Guy.
And yes, Everett is the uptight law enforcement type who would rather follow the book than listen to
unconventional wisdom. Let's not do long, deep character studies here. Instead, enjoy Gleeson's brilliant
execution as an oaf who does eventually show he has some standards and Cheadle who succeeds in
fostering a reluctant rapport with the uncultured local.
This film has a great number of high-end, low-brow comedic lines and moments--not that easy to pull off.
The actors stay in character throughout, never once missing a beat (get it? cop beat? sorry...). So this is a
dark comedy that doesn't become juvenile or gory... hey I'm a big fan, sign me up! Bathroom humor was
not spared during the film, but it was not gratuitous either. Kudos to screenwriter John Michael
McDonagh, who won an award at the Berlin Film Festival for the screenplay.",1408406400,,2297,4.907455012853471

4898838,3,B005WAP2V0,"I thought I would like this better, and I certainly wasn't bothered by the sex (comic) and violence (appropriately cartoonish), but it never quite came together for me.  There are moments that veer to deeper feeling than anything in ""Fargo,"" say -- I'm thinking of the dying mother story, which is touchingly handled, and the widow of the young gay cop who is killed, who although she married him to get a visa, has a sense of him as a good person.  And there are funny conversations among the drug dealing trio -- like the killer who wants it understood that he's a sociopath, not a psychopath, but ,when asked the difference, can't say!  Compared to that trio, the odd-couple relationship between Doyle (Brendan Gleeson) and the FBI agent Wendell (Don Cheadle) seems underdeveloped and underwritten.  There are stereotypical elements too -- Gleeson plays the apparently dumb Irishman who is smarter than he seems -- but the main problem is the emotional rhythm and the grafting of a shoot-em-up ending on to a plot that would seem to require something a little bit less predictable.  In this kind of movie, it's not enough to keep the audience off-balance -- there has to be some sense of shape that makes the whole feel right aesthetically even with the genre-mixing.  I never found that rhythm here.  In ""Fargo,"" for example, the movie is more visually arresting -- in this one, the cinematography doesn't seem to be doing much work. I wondered if budgetary constraints limited the visual appeal, especially when you think of the snowscapes in ""Fargo.""  Here, there isn't much that says ""Ireland"" -- and yet surely the Irishness of the setting is important. The movie isn't a disaster, by any means, but not all that engaging either.",1389225600,,1737,4.824915824915825

The characters are mostly self-aware, taunting each other for fulfilling or violating the very stereotypes that give them life.

Every character has humor and a backstory, every one is treated with sympathy. None except perhaps Don Cheadle's FBI agent are quite what you expect.

Unlike Fargo, there are no scenes in The Guard in which we are expected to laugh simply because the characters on screen are so inarticulate or foolish.

I don't think The Guard made much money, which is a shame. I'd have cheered for a sequel.

4898885,5,B005WAP2V0,"If you like your humor served black, sharp, witty and Irish, then 'The Guard' is hand-made and packaged to your exacting specifications.  And, if you say, ""hey, that sounds like a lot like one of my favorite films,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-Bruges/dp/B001D23BFK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In Bruges</a>,"" well, that's no coincidence: Writer/Director John Michael McDonagh is the brother of In Bruges' maestro, Martin McDonagh.  The fact that Irish actor Brendan Gleeson appears in both films strengthens the parallels even further.

Gleeson is superb here in every scene (and, he is in EVERY scene) as a local cop who may not be as slow-witted and lazy as he's letting on.  It takes visiting FBI agent Everett, played straight by Don Cheadle, almost a bit too long to catch up to that fact.  Thankfully, for the sake of his hide, Everett does figure out that - laconic asides and 'what, me worry?' attitude to the contrary - Gleeson's Boyle is very smart indeed.  If you like Brendan Gleeson the way I do (I love his big, happy, engaging personality - catch his delightful interviews if you've not), then this, too, is the film for you.

Like most Gleeson roles, if you're not Irish you'll have to pay strict attention to his quick, thick, acerbic delivery - often delivered sotto voce.  That effort will pay off.",1342828800,,1365,5.229357798165138
4898886,5,B005WAP2V0,"Sergeant Gerry Boyle is an atypical Irish garda (policeman): he takes drugs, hires prostitutes and has no problem interfering with a crime scene. He also has an instinctive talent for police work and an impressive amount of luck. When an international drug smuggling operation is discovered operating in the Galway area, Boyle is forced to partner American FBI agent Wendell Everett to bring the smugglers to justice.

On paper, The Guard sounds like a cliche-in-waiting: a chalk and cheese buddy cop movie, in which the straight-laced FBI agent teams up with the slightly crazy Irish policeman and they fail to get along, before circumstances makes them appreciate the other's approach, leading to a happy ending and mutual respect.

This isn't that film. Instead, The Guard is an offbeat, frequently hilarious and well-characterised mini-masterpiece. The normally-excellent Brendan Gleeson is indomitably magnificent in the central role of Boyle, an offbeat and weird policeman who delights in randomly odd acts, whilst Don Cheadle is considerably more restrained (until his frustration explodes into expletive-strewn invective) as Everett. The two actors have a great chemistry which drives the film along. Another important ingredient is the interplay between our three principal villains (Liam Cunningham's Francis, David Wilmot's Liam and Mark Strong's Clive), who break up the monotony between murderous drug jobs by engaging in philosophical quote-offs and debating how best to recruit nameless goon minions.

The film's setting is also key. From the point of view of someone who lived there for a year, Galway and Connemara (a Gaelic-speaking region to the west of the city) are depicted very well. One of director John Michael McDonagh's more amusing quirks is to stage the film like a Western, with Ireland standing in for the American West, complete with saloons and shoot-outs (the film also features one of the better uses of the Chekhov's gun rule). This adds to the film's offbeat atmosphere.

The movie also features some amusing commentary about the cliches of buddy cop films and their predictability, which the film then fails to adhere to. There are also some nice emotional beats (such as the relationship between Boyle and his dying mother, and the complex relationship between Boyle's police sidekick and his wife) but these are handled subtly and not laboured over. The film ends on a note of ambiguity, which the movie then lampoons mercilessly just for the hell of it.

The Guard (*****) is a genuinely funny, outrageous and smart movie. It is available now in the UK (DVD, Blu-Ray) and USA (DVD, Blu-Ray).",1341532800,,2633,5.244655581947743

The opening scene is grim, and yet it ends with a line of dialogue that must be one of the darkest, and best, opening lines of any comedy ever made. Priceless. It sets the tone for the whole film.

The humour is not for everybody.  It is frequently very dark.  Much of it relies upon a sense of irony and incongruity that some people (including a few reviewers here) plainly do not have.  A shame really.

It also helps to have some understanding of the cultural imagery - much of it based on Catholic teaching - that is being given a twist.

4898889,4,B005WAP2V0,"Something there is that is charming about films set in Ireland with Irish characters speaking in beautiful brogue and THE GUARD fits into that category very comfortably.  Written and directed by John Michael McDonagh  this is a funny, fast-paced film that manages to poke fun at many points of bigotry (anti-American, racism, the gay lifestyle, etc) in a manner that keeps the comedy rolling. In many ways the film is comparable to the film IN BRUGES, if that helps the reader to categorize in a positive way.

Sergeant Gerry Boyle (Brendan Gleason) is a small-town Irish cop in Western Ireland with a confrontational personality, a subversive sense of humor, a dying mother, a fondness for prostitutes, and absolutely no interest whatsoever in the international cocaine-smuggling ring that has brought straight-laced FBI agent Wendell Everett (Don Cheadle, in a role that allows him to display his comedic gifts) to his door. Boyle's partner, a gay man Aidan McBride (Rory Keenan), the brunt of many of Boyle's jokes, is shot while making a traffic arrest by the drug smuggling gang (Mark Strong, Liam Cunningham, Owen Sharpe, Michael Og Lane) which leaves the cantankerous Boyle to align with the American black FBI agent Everett to solve the case.  What begins as a fiction filled alignment ends up as a touching friendship.

McConagh's writing and direction are as fine as they come for films of this sort.  It will be necessary for most viewers to turn on the subtitles to understand the brogue (the few Gaelic passages are not translated!).  The cast, from the major roles to the minor ones (especially the extraordinarily beautiful Katarina Cas) including Laurence Kinlan and Fionnula Flanagan, is superb.

4898894,3,B005WAP2V0,"A pithy, profane cop movie/dark comedy in which a fat loutish Guard and a U.S. FBI agent investigate a drug ring and nobody's hands are clean and, after a while, everyone is laughing. The humor bounces around in this one, with simple actions like drinking a milkshake (and its repercussions) taking on a kind of loony seriousness, while other gags--like a silly payoff involving a derringer--are eye-rollingly obvious. While the Guard covers no new ground, it is a cheerfully dark ride, primarily because of Brennan Gleeson's stone-serious portrayal of a crooked cop who, in his first few minutes of screen time, eats stolen LSD and sits in bed for a while, looking off-camera, his hair lightly tousled and eyes completely unfocused. Don Cheadle is also excellent as his de facto partner, though he isn't given a whole lot to do until the movie's satisfyingly violent, though sadly cookie-cut finale.
Conforming to this many audience expectations is usually troublesome, yet The Guard manages not to be boring. It relies on little touches, like the aforementioned milkshake and a pint-sized boy who drags around his dog whilst riding a bicycle (and who delivers a hilarious deadpan line about heroin). Other actors like Mark Strong give affable though bored performances that, like the film's drug-dealing arc, amount to very little of substance (pardon to pun). Fans of quirky police procedurals (1998's failed Clay Pigeons comes to mind--though with a differing Second Act) should find something to enjoy here. Overall, however, director John Michael McDonaugh has a hard time balancing the dark and the humorous and it is painfully obvious that he has been influenced by his successful Pillowman-playwright brother Martin (who perhaps had a hand in getting Gleeson for this flick as he starred in Martin's wildly funny and similarly grim Colin Ferrell vehicle In Bruges). While the blue washed out color palate is quietly enveloping, the film loses itself in shaky wordplay, much of which is garbled by the characters' thick accents. The details which do surface are, by turns, both clever and dead-balloon-like. Alas, when the credits roll (and, for whatever trite reason they are HUGE CREDITS--the director's name literally filling the entire screen--is this a new narcissistic trend?)) it is but Gleeson who steals the show.",1332979200,,2330,5.199468085106383

The Guard is fun, intelligent, and genuinely hilarious. The dialog is outstanding and is a high point of the film. In addition, the scenery is superb.

4898904,5,B005WAP2V0,"The Guard, a small independent film from Ireland written and directed by John Michael McDonagh, is something of a gem. On the surface, it could fall into any number of the usual categories - crime drama, fish-out-of-water story, odd couple forced to work together buddy flick - but none of those labels would do it proper justice. The closest thing I can truly compare it to is the Coen brothers' film Fargo. Like Fargo, The Guard deals with a homicide in a quiet rural area (in this case coastal Ireland instead of Minnesota) being investigated by the local authority (in this case an idiosyncratic Garda - Irish policeman - instead of a highly pregnant sheriff). But also like Fargo, what makes the film truly interesting is the character studies that unfold as we see both sides - the police and the criminals - going about their missions.

And in a final comparison to Fargo and to Coen brothers films in general, the dialogue is frequently priceless. At the film's center is the guard of the title, Sergeant Gerry Boyle (Brendan Gleeson), an Irish policeman stationed in the district of Connemara on the western coast of Ireland. In the opening scene, where Boyle witnesses a car accident on a rural road where some local youths are killed, we quickly learn three things about Boyle - very little ever rattles him, he's definitely more attuned to the spirit of the law than the letter, and he's far from being above the occasional bit of self indulgence. Shortly after that, when he's investigating an apparent murder and having to break in a new partner, Aidan McBride (Rory Keenan) at the same time, we learn something else about Boyle: he delights in being a crude, rude, pain in the ass to just about everyone, deliberately goading or provoking people just to see how they'll react.

The plot deepens when an American FBI agent, Wendell Everett (Don Cheadle) shows up, tracking an international drug-smuggling operation who's rumored to be in the district planning a drop, and it turns out that Boyle's murder victim is connected to the drug gang. From that point things quickly become a tangle of murder, bribery, blackmail and deception as Boyle and Everett try to close in on the gang before the drop can be pulled off and the gang in turn does everything they can to get the two out of the way so that they can make their pick-up without interference.

But it's the characters and their interactions along the way that really drive The Guard and make it a cut above the usual crime drama fare. Gleeson's Boyle is a delight to watch - alternating between charming and sensitive one moment and poke-in-the-eye offensive the next - and you can tell Gleeson is having a lot of fun playing him, like when a freckle-faced boy asks him what a derringer he found is for and Boyle replies ""It's for shooting small Protestants."" A touching sub-plot reveals yet another side to Boyle. His mother, Eileen (marvelously played by Fionnula Flanagan) is in a local hospice, apparently with some form of terminal cancer. The scenes between mother and son are both darkly funny and moving, and you can see where Boyle gets his life-on-my-terms approach to things.

Don Cheadle's by-the-book straight-laced Everett is the straight man to many of Boyle's jabs but he handles the role well, managing to be funny without being ridiculous. One great scene comes when Everett finally sees through Boyle's ""Ugly Irishman"" game and Boyle realizes it and just grins, the exchange all through facial expressions. Another great scene has Everett tromping through the Connemara countryside trying to question residents who refuse to speak to him in anything but Gaelic (translated in subtitles so that you know what they're saying while Everett does not, adding to the comic effect).

The members of the drug gang - two Irishmen, Francis Sheehy (Liam Cunningham) and Liam O'Leary (David Wilmot), and an Englishman, Clive Cornell (a stand-out performance by Mark Strong) - are particularly engaging in their scenes. Like one where they're driving along killing time debating the merits of various philosophers based on nationality, or another where they're in a local aquarium and Cornell is staring thoughtfully at the glass and comments ""I like sharks. They're... soothing."" Or yet another where Cornell delivers a pay-off and flies into a devastatingly sarcastic rant when asked if the money's all there. Other characters add to the color, including a cowboy-hat wearing IRA man embarrassed over a missing cache of weapons, a pale-faced camera-flashing local youth who apparently has a fetish for crime scenes, a pint-sized boy disappointed that Cheadle's FBI man isn't with the Behavioral Science Unit he's seen on TV (apparently the only thing that's going to impress anyone in the district), and a couple of cheery uniformed prostitutes who liven up Boyle's day off.

About the only cautions I would mention are that the accents - Irish and English - are a bit on the thick side, and the ending does involve one ambiguous outcome. It's well set up and you could come down on either side of it, but it's deliberately left unclear.

Other than that though, I highly recommend The Guard as a film well worth catching and John Michael McDonagh as a writer/director worth following.",1330041600,38,5265,4.908988764044944

4898910,5,B005WAP2V0,"The guard of the title is Sergeant Gerry Boyle (Brendan Gleeson) of the Galway Garda in Western Ireland. Garda means policeman in Irish, so the movie should, actually, be called The Cop, and, in a way, The Guard is a cop movie. But one you have not seen before.

The story starts with Sergeant Boyle getting to the scene of a car crash and helping himself to some acid he finds in the pocket of one of the dead victims.

""It's a beautiful day,"" he announces to the world at large.

But soon his life gets complicated. It starts with the finding of a dead man, a cult murder it seems, followed by the disappearance of his new partner from Dublin and the arrival of a FBI agent from America to stop the smuggling of half a billion worth of drugs into Ireland.

""Is that street value?"" our guard asks his counterpart FBI agent Wendell Everett (Don Cheadle) as the later briefs the Calway forces. And then, unperturbed by agent Wendell cool stare, he goes on to explain that they must be buying drugs in different streets because, in his, they are not worth that much.

Sergeant Boyle is not concerned about the drug smuggling, he has a murder to solve and a partner to find. But first, he takes a day off to indulge his erotic fantasies with two call girls he hires from Dublin.

Yes, Sergeant Boyle is quite an unorthodox cop. Yet, somehow, he is easy to root for. He loves his mother, for one, and bursts outrageously politically incorrect remarks with a straight face that makes us wonder whether he's totally clueless or pulling our leg. Agent Wendell wonders that too. And, as the story unfolds, his relationship with the Irish cop progresses from total disgust to guarded respect.

The Guard is a great laugh aloud movie, where nothing is sacred, even the IRA is brought into the mixture to comical effect. And the bad guys, cold blooded killers as they are, quote Bertrand Russell and Nietzsche, wonder on the difference between a psychopath and a sociopath and complain about the quality of people they are forced to deal with in their line of business.

His brother Martin has won an Academy Award nomination, for Best Original Screenplay for In Bruges, which also starred Brendan Gleeson, and what I consider the best performance of Colin Farrell's career, and an Academy award for the short feature Six Shooter, A Collection of 2005 Academy Award Nominated Short Films, also starring Brendan Gleeson, and at least two other characters you will see in The Guard, written and directed by MJ.

As the movie begins we see Gerry Boyle, the guard played by BG, in his white squad car parked behind a stone wall, when a red car whizzes by. He does not respond to the speeding car. His response to what happens next, has no words, yet it establishes the nature of the character, as he rummages through pockets, and does something with the drugs. We can deduce that here is a guard that does not follow the established rules, and in fact may even be corrupt.

Next we see him responding to a murder scene. Here we get a truer sense of his character by how he acts around the new cop who will be his partner. Here the comedic tone of the movie gets established. He likes to push buttons and get a reaction. They theorise about the murder, a potted plant placed on the victim's crotch, the significance of the number 5 1/2 painted on the wall. Perhaps he was the 5 1/2th victim, the young one theorises.

Like another reviewer I was struck by the parallels with the Coen Brothers, particularly Fargo, and No Country For Old Men. Instead of the barren landscapes of Minnesota, and the quirky Nordic accents of Minnesotans, we have the bog landscape of the Wesht of Ireland, and the quirks and mores of the locals. We have sociopathic criminals. We also have the quirky Spaghetti Western music, reinforcing the ironic tone. We also have a trace of Ryan's Daughter, and a half cracked young lad on a bike, who mirrors John Hurt's character in that movie. We have murderous criminals who debate their favorite philosophers as they drive along.

So, strait laced, by the book FBI agent Wendell Evers played by Don Cheadle, moseys into town, hot on the trail of an international smuggling ring hoping to land half a billion dollars worth of drugs in Ireland. Instantly, this sets up a culture clash, with Boyle making racially insensitive comments. When rebuked, his response. ""I'm Irish. Racism is part of our culture.""

When Boyle is by himself he wanders his house in his red or yellow y fronts scratching. He does not seem like a brilliant cop. However, not following the book, opens up levels of resourcefulness for him. Guards don't carry firearms in Ireland, yet in a prescient way he manages to acquire weapons, donating the balance to the local IRA man who wears a cowboy hat. With his seeming amorality, you wonder if when push comes to shove, he will back off and let the criminals do their thing or if he will intervene.

Perhaps my favorite scene, the second derringer scene, reminiscent of similar scenes at the beginning of Inglorious Basterds, and final scene with Woody Harrelson in No Country for Old Men. Life and death hangs in the balance.

Boyle tells Evers he came fourth in swimming in the Olympics, which made me search the internet after the movie. The answer may surprise you.

Another theme is the nihilism, which is that events have no inherent meaning, a consistent theme in several Coen Brothers movies.

For non Irish speakers, our FBI detective attempts at one point to interview some Irish speaking people. In speech they refer to him as fear gorm, which the subtitle translates as black man. The word gorm actually means blue. If you were saying it literally, it would be fear dubh (pronounced far duhve).

I know that some people claim that they cannot understand foreign accents. Where on earth do you hear more foreign accents than in North America on a daily basis? If I walk the streets of San Francisco, I will hear German, English, Chinese, Filipino, Mexican, South American, you name it. So, we have Oprah Winfrey, or Sigourney Weaver, narrating BBC produced documentaries because producers think customers cannot discern an English accent. The English in this movie is well spoken with a slight accent. West may be pronounced Wesht, just like Sean Connery doesn't say accent, he says ackshent. Even Schwarzenegger was not the governor of California, he was the governor of Callie phone ee yeah.

I saw this at Robert Redford's Sundance Theater in San Francisco. It was an afternoon show, and the political incorrectness, and several American pop culture references, and fun poking commments resonated with the audience.

If you wish to see Brendan Gleeson in another movie, I recommend John Boorman's The General, where he plays Martin Cahill based on a real life Irish gangster.

So, I loved this movie. I think most people will feel the same way, and I think we have seen a great new talent with Michael John McDonagh, in a very impressive first outing as director. It's clear that talent runs in this family, and perhaps they see parallels between themselves as brothers, and the Coen Brothers. I don't think such a comparison is grandiose, and I wonder if they will work together on future projects. I believe that 'genius, in order to be emulated, must first be imitated.'

Update. 11/30/11. Last week, on my flight back to San Francisco, I watched a program about the making of The Guard, which has become the highest grossing Irish made movie ever at the Irish box office grossing 4.3 million Euros, beating the previous best, The wind That Shakes The Barley, starring Cillian Murphy. To put this this in an American context, it's about $1.50 for every man, woman and child in the country.

I think you will love it, and I hope this was helpful. Thank you.",1328832000,20,6005,4.765158806544755
4898914,5,B005WAP2V0,"Hilarious look at an Irish policeman trying to ignore a big drug deal and just exist with the corruption and bs that is part of his job. At the same time, he must work with an FBI agent without any sense of humor, his mother is dying and reading Oblomov, and he spends his days off with prostitutes rather than work on the case. The bad guys, who are completely hilarious as well, find him anyway, in between discussing whether Bertrand Russell was Welsh. It's a black comedy, yes. It's not any more realistic than most Hollywood films, but it's at least not that serious about itself. There are serious moments and then the movie laughs at itself via the over-educated bad guys. The honest cop, Gleeson's character, finally sees his chance to make good. I found this a very satisfying and intelligent turn on the theme of the honest cop who fights corruption, Irish-style.

Note that this movie assumes a level of education that is prevalent in Ireland, perhaps. The one-star ratings here lead me to believe that some things went over the reviewers' heads.

Moreover, there were utterly gratuitous deviant sex scenes in this film. Apparently the Irish, utterly devoid of any sense of purpose in their lives, find humor in their protagonists pursuing deviant sex.

4898918,5,B005WAP2V0,"At first glance, The Guard may look like a buddy cop comedy with fish-out-of-water elements, but we're pretty far from Rush Hour territory here. To be specific, we're in the cold, rural climes of County Galway, where Sergeant Gerry Boyle enforces the law in a highly idiosyncratic manner. Enter Wendell Everett, a straight-laced FBI man, who teams up with Boyle to solve an international drug trafficking case. Boyle is so fond of drugs, hookers, and politically incorrect pronouncements that Everett is never quite sure if he's a buffoon or a genius, and Gleeson's performance is so strong that he rarely tips his hand. The Guard won raves for its fine performances, witty dialogue, and evocative sense of place, and it's a great example of a film that makes age-old conventions feel fresh again.",1328054400,3,797,5.0
4898919,3,B005WAP2V0,"Sergeant Gerry Boyle (Brendan Gleason) is an Irish cop in a small district. He is a rough cut of a man who drinks, swears like a sailor and likes the whores.

While investigating a murder he gets teamed up with an FBI agent Wendell Everett (Don Cheadle) to help investigate a drug smuggling scheme worth $500,000,000 dollars. It seems that almost everybody involved is on the take with that kind of money on the table.

Despite his obvious faults, Officer Boyle has his morals and is torn over what to do. In the words of FBI agent Wendell Everett, Officer Boyle is either the dumbest or the smartest person he has ever met. You'll have to be the judge.

This is a dark comedy with a lot of bloodshed and a LOT of obscenities. The F-bomb is used probably over 100 times. If you can get over the language then you realize the story is pretty good. The acting and scenery of Ireland was well done. I didn't rate it higher as the obscenities were just over the top.",1328054400,4,1027,4.34375
4898920,5,B005WAP2V0,"An excellent film that showcases an outstanding actor on his home turf.

In 'Guard', the always enjoyable Brendan Gleeson portrays a fascinating and hilariously unique character.

Sergeant Gerry Boyle is a terribly inappropriate and deeply offensive, yet insightful, Irish cop. He's been on the job for quite a number of years and is less than enthused with his mundane daily routine. Ironically, he hates it more when that mundanity is interrupted, like with a series of murders. And to make matters worse, he absolutely detests it when the 'big city' cops get involved.

Initially, Gerry strikes you as a complete anti-social doofus. A misfit that chugs along only because he exists in an outlier township, therefore mostly separated from proper society. He lives alone, finds temporary companionship in prostitutes, and intentionally separates himself from the daily drama of human interaction. But there's more to Officer Boyle than first meets the eye - or hits you in the ear.

Hilariously, whatever and whenever anything crosses his mind - it just comes out. And it's not that he doesn't realize that his behavior causes distress among those he interacts with, he knows. He just doesn't give a crap. Part of that is his upbringing - he's Irish. Part of that is tactical. He'll push your buttons to see what happens; a homemade personality test of sorts. And part of it is his genuine disinterest in other people, bordering on misanthropy.

Yet he exhibits empathy and kindness when you least expect it.

As we're introduced to the character, the opening scene has him on traffic patrol as a bunch of young idiots speed by his post, completely blasted. He watches them fly by and continues to munch a sandwich and drink coffee. Only after finishing does he start up and slowly proceed after them - perfunctory job execution. It's no surprise to Gerry as he comes upon the wrecked car and bodies strewn about - none alive. He picks through them to insure they're in fact gone and discovers one has a large bag of drugs. He pockets it. We're led to believe he wants it for himself, but quietly utters, ""Your family doesn't need to know about this.""

The contradiction is very fascinating, and I enjoyed this character very much. I wonder if many Irish folk are actually like this? I'd love to find out one day.

His current punching bag: Straight-laced-by-the-book FBI agent Wendell Everett, played by Don Cheadle; assigned to track down a cocaine-filled ship inbound to Ireland. And unfortunately for him, Officer Boyle is his only viable assist to stop the huge shipment. Why? Because it turns out that Gerry is the only straight cop in the district. And not because he's a moral standout, but because he's just too damn independent to allow himself to be ""told"" what to do. As long as you stay out of his way - you're golden. Step into his path and you'd better have a damn good reason to do so. Stick your finger into his chest (or point a gun) - and you'd better prepare to draw back a stump.

Can Wendell withstand the constant barrage of foul and insulting comments while still working with the obnoxious officer? And what exactly are Boyle's intentions in regards to the impending drug shipment, various murders, and Wendell himself?

Questions that, appreciatively, aren't answered until the final few minutes of the film.

What follows is a very humorous and intriguing character study, as Gleeson straddles a very fine line between interesting and repellant. And very much like a traffic accident, one can't help but look and stare.

Movie Note: I worded the title of this review to make mention that Gleeson is, in this production, home. He's Irish and I'm deeply fascinated by that fact. Years ago, I was stunned to learn that the swarthy Scottish warrior in '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Braveheart/dp/B000W8OM5Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Braveheart</a>' was the same actor who played the hilarious humorless sheriff in '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lake-Placid/dp/B000035P86/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lake Placid</a>'.

4898924,3,B005WAP2V0,"During the 80s and 90s Hollywood had a structure.  There were certain genres of film that were guaranteed to please mass audiences and ensure box-office success.  There were movies such as operatic sci-fi features, dismal horror franchises, and the recycled, yet inevitable, buddy-cop comedy.  Defined as a crime film with plots involving two men of very different and conflicting personalities who are forced to work together to solve a crime, this sub-genre of the ""buddy films"" seemed to have become transparent until the late 2000s when the wave of Apatow buddy comedies (Pineapple Express, Superbad) seemed to saturate the market.  The mismatched Gibson/Glover combination was replaced by crass humor, drug smoking, and over-exaggerated tween underdogs.  Now, the classic genre seems to be returning with such films like Kevin Smith's Cop-Out and Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes, and especially with John Michael McDonagh's 2011 film The Guard.  This film oozes buddy-cop from the beginning, boasting huge talent from the likes of Brendan Gleeson, Don Cheadle, and the overused Mark Strong.  Gleeson plays a small town Irish Garda (cop), who isn't afraid to speak his mind and rule the coop.  From the opening car accident, Gleeson is shown as an officer who realizes crime will happen; his role is to be there to clean it up.  This isn't a story about a corrupt cop, but merely a man understanding Ireland and reacting with the modern crime climate.  Everything has its place, Gleeson is introduced to FBI Agent Everett (played with sheer boredom by Don Cheadle) by way of a faux-occult serial killing.  By a cinematic miracle, the two join together to bring down an international drug smuggling ring, attempt to tell a few jokes, and finally end up causing more confusion than clarity throughout the hour and thirty minute ride.

Praised at Sundance for being funnier than Hot Fuzz and In Bruges combined, The Guard does allow Brendan Gleeson to take a leading comic role.  This is a step away from the stoic historical figures and emotional dramas that viewers typically find on Gleeson's platter.  This feels fresh.  While Hot Fuzz was more unchained pop-culture comedy, Gleeson provides the perfect blend of wit, emotion, and Irish vernacular.  You laugh AT Simon Pegg; but in The Guard you laugh WITH Gleeson.  Listening to him speak lines like, ""You're thinking, these men are armed and dangerous, and you being an FBI agent you're more used to shooting at unarmed women and children..."" one is introduced to a great taste of the culture and the foreign surroundings.  This is Brendan Gleeson's film.  He controls the scenes, he leads the fight, and he provides the comic relief.  His nomination for a Golden Globe demonstrates his dominance in this film.  The Guard is worth the time merely for Gleeson alone, which leads me to Don Cheadle.  Cheadle's choice Everett's characterization could, and should, have been done by anyone in the movie industry (animal or vegetable).  He was monotonous, he was bland, he was dull, and he provided no value to the overall story or plot structure.  Perhaps Cheadle was overshadowed by Gleeson's Boyle, but the two did not fit the above mentioned definition of ""buddy-cop"".  There needed to be a driving force behind Cheadle instead of merely lap-dogging around Ireland with Gleeson.  Jokes fell flat with Cheadle, unsure if he felt out of place in Ireland, or it was the writing, but when Cheadle goes door to door searching for evidence (or a witness), we are uncomfortable instead of laughing.  Gleeson throws the jabs and zings, while Cheadle merely absorbs and shuffles his was from scene to scene.  With this undesirable turn, The Guard instantly transforms into a Brendan Gleeson movie, with a lackluster supporting role by Don Cheadle (animal or vegetable).

Admitting, the cinematography was beautiful in this film.  Larry Smith should be praised for taking the stark grey of Ireland and coupling it with some bright neon interiors of each scene.  Alas, despite how beautiful this film looked, the story itself could not keep up.  Written by In Bruges' brother John Michael McDonagh, our story is flawed in the execution.  Small parts do not seem to fit within the frame of the whole.  This should have been a simple drug story, but McDonagh intermits his screenplay with unannounced small twists (i.e. the occult murder) that try to keep us guessing, but instead sends you down winding paths with no end in sight.  We know, early in the film, who our villains are (and if you don't - look for the group of guys [Mark Strong] who are cast as villains in nearly every film), and this reveal should send us on a straight path to the ending.  But, instead of being our guide to the dramatic conclusion, McDonagh's script calls for a child picking up guns in the swamp and conversations on ""liquidate"" to fill space.  When the ending arrives, the audience is so washed from the experience and mismatched storylines, that no emotion or excitement can be produced for the final seconds.  In this viewer's opinion, McDonagh was attempting to recreate the popularity of his brother's film In Bruges by casting Cheadle in a lead role, but unlike Colin Ferrell and Brendon Gleeson's chemistry, McDonagh doesn't give enough for Cheadle to do, and it becomes a one-man film full of dissapointment.

In the end, The Guard is a fun ride, but not a perfect film.  Watch this movie for Gleeson's comedic talent and Don Cheadle's epic failure.  The pairing is weighted to the wrong side and despite the beauty of each scene, the story's focus is too scattered for the short amount of time.  Too many personalities attempt to fight for screen time forcing Gleeson to the top.  This is a foreign film, and perhaps some of the Irish nuances were lost in translation, but not a film that should have been a bigger money-maker than The Wind that Shakes the Barley.  Good, but nowhere near great.  John Michael McDonagh doesn't quite have the talent behind the camera as his brother Martin has already demonstrated, and recreating the same wheel doesn't showcase your talent for cinematic imagination.",1327536000,2,6136,4.960861056751468

I watched this twice in a week just because I knew I missed a lot on the first viewing. The brogue is thick and the jabs are subtle but are worth watching again just to catch them all.  One might even want to watch it with subtitles so-as not to miss anything.  Most of the other reviewers have done a good job of laying out the plot, which is pretty straightforward.  The fun is watching the crew bring it to life, especially Brendan Gleeson, whom I did not recognise as Mad-Eye Moody from Harry Potter.  This movie owes much to 60's spaghetti westerns, especially the music, but has been wonderfully updated to the 21st century.  The ending is an old fashioned gunfight, with a realistic limit of ammunition, highly dependent on the sheer grit of the opposing gunmen.  Mark Strong plays an extremely cynical gangster who lives for the mano-a-mano shoot out: ""This is better than Christmas."" moments before he dies.  The only thing I think might make this a better movie would have been to make the F.B.I. agent a cynical Irish-American cop or someone who grew up in Detroit, Gary or South Central.  I've met cops who know the hood, and it wouldn't take much of a stretch for them to be little different than Brendan Gleeson's character.  Doing this might remove the oppourtunity to showcase some of Sgt. Boyle's crass, offensive, and racist humor, but might have created an oppourtunity to move beyond the straightlaced, arrogant, by-the-book, not-too-bright F.B.I. stereotype and delve in to differences between the european Irish and and the American world-view, not just their stereotypes of us.

4898930,4,B005WAP2V0,"""The Guard"" is a black comedy featuring that blunt, mocking sense of humor that is peculiar to Ireland. Police Sergeant Gerry Boyle (Brendan Gleeson) doesn't actually think much of the law and is contemptuous of rules and procedures. He just got a new partner, Aiden McBride (Rory Keenan) from Dublin, and they're working on a murder investigation. Soon after, FBI Special Agent Wendell Everett (Don Cheadle) arrives from the US to enlist the help of the local police in intercepting a ship that is heading their way with half-a-billion dollars of cocaine on board. Four drug traffickers to whom the cocaine is destined are thought to be at large in Connemara. But it's not clear if Everett will be able to tolerate Boyle's politically incorrect antics in the meantime.

It is said that the Irish never speak well of one another. On screen, even their dramatic moments are tinged with self-mocking. I often find it impossible to discern the comedy from the tragedy in Irish films. Perhaps that's only because I'm not Irish. But ""The Guard"" mixes the two with a stereotypically foul-mouthed, blunt-talking Irish cop who is, not coincidentally, the only one not on the take. Director John Michael McDonagh and production designer John Paul Kelly have given us some interesting interiors, as well. A green bedroom, cobalt interrogation room, bold colors everywhere.

4898936,1,B005WAP2V0,"Most movie viewers don't realize that there are actually paid reviewers out there. Be suspicious when you get very lengthy and detailed reviews. Anyway, on to the movie. Props and settings consist of mostly a pub, a couple of rooms and a few limited scenes of Ireland being limited to a gravel road; a short section of gravelly beach; a concrete pier; intersection in town with a couple of fronts of houses. The movie ""Nothing Personal"" was far superior in showing us the beauty of Ireland.

It was so slow and boring, especially the dialogue, that my watching a garden slug creep along while the movie played seemed like the Kentucky Derby in comparison. The movie is 90%  conversations surrounded by drinks, hookers and cussing and really dumb stereotypic humor about American culture and it's no coincidence that we have a black FBI agent in Ireland to act out the foil portrayal. It reminded me of a TV '70s sitcom. The plot was standard drugs being offloaded by ship at the town pier (of course) with our traffickers killing one of their own and a local cop - both of which made no sense and added nothing to the plot structure. Local cop is portrayed as a self serving philistine that sees the light in the final scene by stepping up and killing the bad guys with Sergio Leone style music playing in the back ground.

I actually found the precursor short movie to the ""The Guard"" called ""The Second Death"" to be better acted, even with many of the same actors appearing in both movies, and with a more engaging storyline.",1326067200,9,1527,4.606617647058823
4898937,5,B005WAP2V0,"I saw this in a theater and loved it. My friend and I exited the theater looked at each other and then very nearly turned around and went back in to watch it again. Would've done so if we weren't totally starving and in need of supper.

Not an action thriller, not a mismatched buddy comedy, but with many of the signs of both. Viewers looking for the pacing of either of these genres are going to be disappointed. Instead the Guard rewards appreciation of great characters, bone dry humor, carefully observed culture clashes, beautiful cinematography and production design. And to top it off music by the amazing and fierce Calexico helps to open up atmospheric space for surprisingly emotional impact.

Brendan Gleeson is sheer nonstop delight. Don Cheadle is makes a great, slightly befuddled foil. Made me want to go out and see everything Gleeson's in.",1325980800,,857,4.8231292517006805

No wonder why. Amazon was gracious enough to refund my money. I don't feel this is the fault of Amazon in anyway, they have no way of knowing the content of every movie. I think it is a shame that such junk can get a five star rating.",1325980800,6,500,3.7264150943396226
4898939,5,B005WAP2V0,"What a pleasure, in this day and age, to find a police procedural with witty dialog and memorable characters!

The Guard is the story of an honest cop in Galway, played by the wonderful, rumpled Brendan Gleeson, who partners with a visiting FBI agent, played by the great Don Cheadle, to thwart a gang of drug-dealers.

The script is as tight as a drum, distinguished by indelible characterizations and the funniest dialog you've heard in any Irish pub.

To the reviewer here who found the slurs aimed at the Cheadle character offensive -- EVERYONE here gets slagged, in the true Irish way.  Verbal combat keeps the Irish mind sharp, and the FBI man dishes it out as well as he takes it.  If anything, the bond between the black agent and white cop becomes stronger and stronger as they learn to overcome their prejudices and presuppositions, and the agent winds up risking his life for his new-found partner.

So this movie will appeal to two audiences: folks looking for a profane black comedy as well as those who enjoy taut police procedurals.

UPDATE: I had originally bought this DVD from Amazon and returned it because it contained none of the special features promised.  Recently I found a copy in a $5 bin at a drugstore and discovered to my amazement that the new edition has special features galore: an audio commentary, behind the scenes, deleted and extended scenes, and a featurette that inspired the movie.

So look for the edition that does NOT feature film awards under the names of the stars on the front cover.  The catalog number shown on the spine of the feature-rich edition is 572930; make sure you get this edition, and not the original stripper...",1325980800,2,1672,4.73448275862069

4898944,5,B005WAP2V0,"John McDonagh, in my opinion has pulled off an oddly captivating Irish thriller. While so many comparisons have been made between this movie and 'In Bruges', I see 'The Guard' as superior. McDonagh is just getting better. For instance, the violence and vulgarity present in both films were necessary, to some point. I found them way over the top in 'In Bruges', unpalatable at times. Sure, 'The Guard' was somewhat vulgar and a wee bit violent, but only when these characteristics seemed 'necessary' to the situation.  Thus, it did not interrupt my viewing pleasure...

The music (Western) was inclusive, made me want to dance a few times.  The sound of the castanets clicking away was such a south of the border way to let us know when something exciting was going to happen. Yes, the beautiful cinematography of the Irish countryside and the marvelous melodies were one great way to combine the idea of the two countries working together.

But, really, it was just a finely done film in every way.  Not only will I watch it again, I will be watching for more of John McDonagh's work.",1325721600,,1085,4.75

I was SO disappointed that the DVD didn't come out in time to give as Christmas Presents.  It would've been the perfect gift for so many people I know!

For people that had a difficult time understanding the dialogue at times, seeing the movie on DVD might be just the thing.  You can go back to hear it again to figure out what they're saying (though I'd recommend watching it all the way through the first time without chopping it up).  Don Cheadle did a great job, as always, this time playing Brendon Gleeson's straight man.  Great movie.  Can't wait to buy it and laugh all over again!",1325548800,,874,4.351851851851852
4898946,5,B005WAP2V0,"Where do I begin? Praise is bubbling out of me about every aspect of this film, from the location and the actors, to the script and the dialogue. I will own the DVD so I can use closed captions because some of the brogue escaped me, but what I heard was erudite, wry and very, very funny. My pre-ordered DVD from Amazon.com will be here in about a week. I can hardly wait!

Here is part of the wonderful cast:

  * Brendan Gleeson (""Troy"" and ""Harry Potter"") is our eponymous Guard, a local policeman whose job it is to cope with trivial issues in his little seaside hamlet. He pays more attention to his regularly scheduled visits from prostitutes than rumors of a half-billion pounds worth of drugs. Remembering Gleeson's astonishing single-take monologue from ""In Bruges,"" I already knew he was a great dramatic actor, I just don't remember him in a comedy before.
  * Don Cheadle (""Iron Man 2"") is a tightly wound American FBI agent hot on the trail of a huge cocaine shipment rumored to be headed toward Ireland. He is dumbfounded by the provincialism and blatant racism he encounters in this little burg. Hard-working Cheadle appears in family films, comedies and dramas; he always does a terrific job.
  * Fionnula Flanagan (""Kill the Irishman"") is our hero's mother, dying of cancer, who just wants to see live music performed one more time. You'll smile. Another multi-talented star, this lovely lass has been working for decades.
  * Mark Strong (""Sherlock Holmes"") is a cocaine smuggler/henchman, who is starting to question if the payoff is worth it. In this cast of multiple threats, Strong stands out: He has played supporting roles in so many A-listed films, I can't begin to name them! Suffice it to say, he plays many nationalities, plays good guys (but mostly bad guys), and shows up in movies all over the world.

The Irish locations are authentic, unique and memorable, while the dialogue is delicious. The characters are unusual: the drug dealers engage in cerebral chats, e.g., how many well-known poets were born in Wales. Naturally the local folks are rustic eccentrics. I'm always surprised when I'm reminded how familiar many Europeans are with American history, e.g. the kind of derringer used to assassinate Abraham Lincoln.

Expect profanity, gunshots and some blowie uppie stuff. Brush up your Irish dialect and DO NOT MISS THIS MOVIE!",1324684800,,2365,4.870324189526184
4898947,5,B005WAP2V0,"One of my favorite movies of 2008 was IN BRUGES, a quirky action/comedy about a pair of hit men, written and directed by Martin McDonagh and starring Brendan Gleeson.

Now, McDonagh's brother, John Michael McDonagh, has written and directed THE GUARD, also starring Gleeson and also an action comedy with a like eccentric sense of humor.

Gleeson plays a blunt, individualist police sergeant in a small town on the west coast of Ireland, who finds himself out of his depth when faced with solving both a murder and the disappearance  of one of his officers.  At the same time, he must deal with an FBI agent (Don Cheadle), who has come to the Emerald Isle to intercept a major shipment from an international band of drug smugglers.

It's no secret that Gleeson and Cheadle are looking for the same people, but the pair are at loggerheads from the start and much of this movie's fun comes from their outrageous banter, and the fact that, on the surface, the small town cop refuses to cooperate with the Yank's investigation.  This forces Cheadle to do his own detective work, not an easy task for a black man wearing a suit in rural Ireland where most people insist in speaking Gaelic.

Nothing is quite what it seems in this witty film, nor do the plot twists turn in the direction that one would expect.  The cast, which includes Mark Strong, Liam Cunningham and Fionnula Flanagan, is excellent, though, at times, it is not easy to understand their Irish accents.

The DVD from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has many extras, including audio commentary by McDonagh, Gleeson, and Cheadle,  deleted and extended scenes, outtakes, a ""Making of"" featurette, a short early film by McDonagh and a Q&A session with the director and two stars at the L.A. Film Festival.

 If you liked IN BRUGES, then you will definitely enjoy THE GUARD.

4898948,5,B005WAP2V0,"Unfortunately, too many reviewers have given away too much of the story.

Fortunately, too few have given away the philosophy, the absurdity and the humor.

This was one of the films I have enjoyed so much that I will watch a few times more for the script, the memorable lines, the characters and the modest but effective cinematography.

There is absolutely no reason to come up with comparisons to other films. It is as much Coen Brothers as it is Groucho Marx or Fellini.

There is politics, sociology, psychology, money, philosophy, sex, reality and hallucination or, if you deem any of these unnecessary in a good movie, you may also be carried away by the violence and slowly boiling up excitement.

I just hope that, the DVD will have English subtitles when it becomes available although I did not find it that difficult to follow as a non-native English speaker.

I have to end with a line by the character least likely to utter these words, ""What is it all about?""",1324166400,3,973,4.6608187134502925

The film stars the great Brendan Gleeson, who has been quietly building a reputation for himself as one of the finest movie actors about, as a small town cop in Connemara, and the brilliant Don Cheedle as an FBI man arriving in Galway on the trail of a bunch of international drugs traffickers. But the whole cast is composed of some of the finest actors currently working, including Liam Cunningham, Mark Strong and Fionuala Flanagan.

At heart the film is a buddy movie about the mismatched cops Cheedle and Gleeson and in the midst of all the prickly dialogue between the two it satisfies all the expectations that one would have of such a movie with a great ""shoot-em-up"" ending. It also makes some nice subtle political points: in spite of the jokey xenophobia of the central character it is the foreign characters, Croatian, African and African-American who are, along with the character of Gleeson's mother, the most dignified and attractive figures portrayed; Dublin and Dubliners are the butt of many of the film's jokes, a nice counter-balance to Dubliners' tendency to treat non-""Pale"" Ireland (ie the area that is not Dublin) as a lesser place.

When a murder and drug ring are shown to be connected the FBI send in agent Wendell Everett (Cheadle) to help investigate.  The two don't get along, but can they solve the crime?  This is a very funny and enjoyable movie, but it is not for everyone.  THe dialog is very harsh and almost of of it is swearing, but it's done in a way that makes you laugh.  For those that liked ""In Bruges"" and movies along that line this is for you.  If you didn't like that I would be weary, this is a very dark comedy and may offend some people that aren't expecting this.  Without giving anything away, if you can laugh at the beginning car wreck you will be fine for the rest of the movie.  I however really liked this movie.  Overall, a flat out hilarious movie that will not appeal to everyone.  I give it a B.

4898953,5,B005WAP2V0,"Brendan Gleeson stars as a small town Sgt. in Ireland. In many ways he reminded me of Andy of Mayberry in that he has his own local quirky ways of doing things, but beneath it all he is quite intelligent. There are some international drug smugglers in his area and the FBI has sent Don Cheadle to work with the very frank, sometimes crass Gleeson who believes racial stereotypes and has no problems questioning Cheadle to the point of his frustration.

The writing is witty and the quirky characters are reminiscent of a Coen brothers masterpiece.

Cheadle is talking about the recent killing to Gleeson:

CHEADLE: ""We need to go door to door and ask people if they saw anything.""

GLEESON: ""You lost me at 'we'"".
