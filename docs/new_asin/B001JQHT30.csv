3659264,4,B001JQHT30,"This movie is set in rural Iowa (Centerville is shown, but could be any small farming town), and revolves around Esper Harte, a young man who just lost his father, and is set to inherit $200,000, as long as his father's urine is clean. Turns out, Esper's Father is a known ""tweeker"", and is on parole with a crooked parole officer entangled with Esper's mother in a plan to get the inheritance from him.  However, in going through Dad's belongings with his girlfriend Diane, Esper discovers a Jar of Crank, and the degradation trip begins from there.

Being in Iowa myself, and seeing first hand what meth does to people, this far fetched scheme to some people for quick cash, either by murder or manufacturing more drugs is actually a good plan to someone in the thrawls of meth psychosis.  These folks can not think strait the longer and more meth someone uses. At first it starts recreational, and it's all down hill from there.

Matt Farnsworth does a great job with his first film, and a nice list of actors such as Rossanna Arquette (Executioner's song, Pulp Fiction), John Savage (The Deer Hunter), and Michael T Weiss (T.V.'s The Pretender). The acting is fair, and with the funding this was likely shot with, reasonable camera and film work.  If you liked films like Requiem for A Dream, then this is worth a viewing.",1239148800,5,1326,4.64957264957265
3659265,2,B001JQHT30,"I had heard loads about this Farnsworth guy playing Iowa years back at Tribeca and getting some awards. Was hoping for some artistic insight into a nasty topic whilst taking place in some scenery waiting to be captured.

I will admit, there were some great geography panoramas, a few nice town square shots and plenty of dilapidation preserves. But the plethora of tweaking episodes and unique camera angles attempting to make the watcher understand tweaking, gets overwhelming. The story revolves around a young couple trying to make a better life for themselves in a small city Iowa setting. Instead of going the right way, they cook meth, share needles, tweak, and then tweak some more. Splice in more forced/rape sex scenes then should be in a film like this, some disgusting flushed baby scenes, meth sex and voila, a film enamored with the fallout of meth usage.

There are obviously important points to take away from this, and it does not belittle the need to raise awareness on this scary epidemic, but it just feels muddled and lost too many times. Decent performances, nice footage, some short DVD extras make for an ok release, but definitely not rewatchable. Some of the cast and crew are making what appears to be a more approachable film this year so I know we will be seeing more of them.",1233964800,3,1304,4.765486725663717
8313499,2,B001JQHT30,somewhere near the beginning of putting this film together there must have been a reasonable plot with interesting characters.  at the end there must have been last minute rewrites and a selection of actors from the school of ham.  only professional actor john savage survives without shame.  I suggest you miss this if you can.,1517616000,,328,4.927272727272728

8313501,2,B001JQHT30,I wonder if anybody who watched this movie said Now that brings back memories?! If there ever was a movie on the reasons why you should not do Crystal Meth then Iowa is it. This movie scared the crap out of me & I think if they showed it in high schools or anywhere else across the country I'm pretty sure it would scare people into staying away from meth. This is the perfect Anti-Meth movie,1432080000,,392,4.171052631578948
8313502,5,B001JQHT30,It is very good movie to really see the problem we still have with the problem still around,1413417600,,91,4.111111111111111

8313504,5,B001JQHT30,"being originally from appanoose co.i liked the film i could see alot of the familiar sites. there is a large meth problem there it was not that far fetched. mr.farnsworth did a real good job on this film. It is a shame that people might remember centerville from this movie rather than the other good things that are there like pancake day, Rathbun dam or the largest city square in the world. but this is life and drug addiction does happen. the documentary as extras on this film were very eye opening, educational by far. i would recommend this movie.",1383177600,,554,4.55
8313505,2,B001JQHT30,"If you want a true-to-life portrait of the meth crisis in rural America, skip ""Iowa,"" the film itself, and go to the extras section on this DVD; Farnsworth's documentary ""Dying for Meth,"" while very much in the preachily patronizing after-school special tradition, does offer an honest and quite disturbning protrait of real people struggling with the vicissitudes of meth addiction.

I'm not so impressed with the film itself, mainly becuase, as a native and life-long Iowan, I find its characters and the portrayal of life here jarringly inauthentic. I live about fifty miles east of where most of the principal photography was done in 2005, and know the area quite well. While Farnsworth bases many of the incidents in the film on the real-life experience of meth addicts in southeast Iowa featured in the aforementioned documentary, this generic tale of addiction and disolution could have been set just about anywhere in rural America, from Georgia to Washington state. In many cases, realism has been sacrificed for drama where the truth is not especially interesting; Farnsworth tries his best to make things graphic and gritty, but ends up with something turgid and banal. The Greg Brown soundtrack is probably the coolest and most authentically Iowa thing about the whole production. And why, oh why do these actors talk the way they do? They all seem to have adopted a decidedly southern drawl, which is NOT the way people around here speak. Also, while I know of many congenitally stupid, venial, egregiously incompetent and hypocritical law-enforcement officials--and even a few corrupt ones , the over the top depiction of the so-called parole officer in ""Iowa"" as a violently misogynistic animal is way too far over the top to be believable--anywhere! Again, played like a cardboard cut-out of a sadistic redneck southern lawman that we've all seen dozens of times before. Iowa is a nice place to live; but ""Iowa"" was a major disappointment.",1342828800,3,1955,5.090342679127726
8313506,5,B001JQHT30,"I read some reviews and thought I would like this movie, and I did.  I did have to watch it a few times to understand some of the undertones that were going on as I was confused, but the insight on Meth addiction and abuse going on was eye openning.  The documentaries included were informational and sad.",1314144000,,305,4.333333333333333
8313507,1,B001JQHT30,"This film is the riposte for ""Field of Dreams"" oft-quoted line, ""Is this Heaven?"" ""No, it's Iowa.""

Now, this film IS called ""Iowa"", and no it's not heaven, it's pure, sleaze-ridden drug Hell.  It's not even up to level of the all-night, drive-in exploitation movies that are lovingly referred to as ""grindhouse classics"" nowadays.  Matt Farnsworth should take the measly proceeds from this embarrassing failure and use them to go to a film school to learn how to direct a movie.  The Coen Brothers, Tarentino, and Larry Clark cover some tawdry territory, but they do it in style.  And, David Lynch, bless his weirdness, actually made a lovely film about Iowa called ""The Straight Story"".

Really, I wish I could say something good about this movie, but I can't. The production values, the acting, the plot, the dialogue---every component of the film is simply awful.  The musical score?  Well, the musical score could be a plus, since it features a number of folksinger Greg Brown's better imitations of Johnny Cash, but the snippets are too short to appreciate, and the audio to the dvd is marred by an annoying ""tunnel effect"".

The Iowa State Legislature should draft a resolution in the form of a restraining order which prevents Mr. Farnsworth from ever filming in the state again.  He's an embarrassment to a state that produced Jean Seberg, Sue Lyon, John Wayne, Cloris Leachman and other film greats.

As for this cow chip of a movie, may it deservedly sink into the great recycling lagoon reserved for total stinkeroos!",1241222400,2,1529,4.887596899224806
