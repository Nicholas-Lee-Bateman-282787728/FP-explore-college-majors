5851383,5,B00DRQETLA,"Absolutely loved it! A 'must have' movie especially for the holidays. I was very moved by the story. Excellent cast & directing.
It's not your typical Christmas movie but I recommend this to every parent to watch this with your teenage kids. A true life lesson to learn. Very realistic, that is why it offended some people. To those who criticize it, you are not living in the real world! I hope your children are so perfect that you have nothing to worry about!",1381104000,5,462,4.511904761904762
5851384,3,B00DRQETLA,"I got this movie because I wanted to see Lexi Ainsworth. Who I think is an amazing actress! Lexi did great and the movie and I thought that it had a good message with it, but I thought it was less then a Hallmark/Lifetime movie. It was that everyone had a problem to deal with. I know that's sometimes what happen in life but I thought in the movie that it was WAY TOO MUCH.

I also that that the ""play"" the kids put on was a down grade for the real Christmas story. It was only a small portion of the movie but I felt like the writers just didn't put thought into it.

Then when the brother prays and says the F word I was shocked and really wanted to turn the movie off but I had gotten that far into the movie that was so so so so slow.

I will keep the movie just because Lexi is in it and I fell like she did a great job in playing the character.",1380844800,6,851,3.8238636363636362
5851385,4,B00DRQETLA,"I've been a fan of Eric ""King of the B-movies"" Roberts ever since I caught The Ambulance and Hitman's Run on cable in the 1990s, and I've been a fan of General hospital since 1984.  I never really understood the persistent appeal of soaps and B-movies until Alexandra Danielle ""Lexi"" Ainsworth graced my television set with ten minutes or more of screentime a day as mafia brat Kristina Corinthos, when the lightbulb went off:  like minor-league baseball, soaps and B-movies offer the chance to watch greatness in the making, literally to catch a rising star before the world does, in generous doses.  Ainsworth, offered this role within seconds of hanging up the phone after being told she was fired from General Hospital because they wanted an older, ""hotter"" Kristina as their romantic lead - only to decline a return to the role when GH realized the error of its ways with her replacement - entered this film like a batter who tore up the minors with a .427 batting average now facing big-league pitching.  How would she fare?  This fan's opinion of her work was strong enough for me to gamble $14.98 on the answer.

For Ainsworth, my standards were much higher than for the film.  Any holiday film is going to be restricted by the parameters of the genre.  For the actress, however, I was looking for signs of whether or not she could carry a film, and if she could score points for more than just avoiding the garden-variety acting mistakes which were absent in her performances on General Hospital, like in the scenes where she flourished, either by staring down an intimidating Bruce Weitz without saying a word, or by humbling soap vet Maurice Benard at the tender age of sixteen.  Where other actresses would have cried, screamed, yelled, and moved their extremities like traffic cops, Ainsworth's instinctive understanding of when to let the scene do the talking strongly suggested she could handle this step up in class like a champion.  My bigger question was whether director Richard Foster, and the writers, could handle her.  On whole, I would say she gave the better accounting of herself.

This is a good, but not a great film.  It is worth the purchase price, and will definitely be worth the time spent watching should it land on cable or Netflix, if only for Ainsworth's performance alone.  In the film, eighteen year-old Ashley Lane (Ainsworth) is put in the position of media-res narrator, which allows her to showcase her talents.  Within minutes, we are shown where the film winds up, leaving the question not what will happen, but why, who will be involved, and how.  Casino was the textbook film on how to pull this off, and this film does so adequately.  Fans who were wondering if Eric Roberts and Vivica A. Fox could sing will get their answer.

The film's saving grace, if one pardons the pun, is the director's astute use of third-billed Ainsworth, clearly the star of the film, with screentime to match.  The lesser talents in the cast are relegated in direct proportion to their ability, except for Roberts, who is seriously underutilized.  Fox gives a good accounting as the mother, but the blended family is more of a gratuitous political statement, as if to say we've come so far against racism that no one bats an eye at a racially mixed family.  The message is useful, but not really central to the film.  What is central is Ashley's journey of self-discovery, played flawlessly by Ainsworth, to the point where, by the end of the film, it Is rather clear she has outstripped the writing, and does not just belong in the majors, but needs to be traded to a championship team, or to have one built around her.

The other actors in the film are competent, with Danielle Vega (Angelina) giving an exceptional performance in a limited supporting role.  Her physical resemblance to Ainsworth is a bit confusing, so pay attention; absent Ainsworth, she could have played the lead more than adequately, and her scenes were among the best of the film.  Glee's Titus Makin (Jason)  shows competence, but not greatness, while Fox and Roberts are not given enough to do until near the end. Bryan Massey (Mac) plays the ""white Magical Negro,"" who assist the lead in her journey of self-discovery, a job on which the writers fell down a peg or two.  Justin Avery (Jon) plays the romantic fodder, but is otherwise superfluous and stereotypical.  Ainsworth is left stranded by the writing, not because the film is poorly written, but because of her amazing talent.  There is only so much one can do with a film like this.

Very early on in the film, Ainsworth mows down the ""movie star"" checklist: flawless body language and voice tone, the ability to slip into character convincingly, a rare level of attention to detail, exceptional range which exceeded the writing, and a sexuality which, while not the typical ""bombshell"" variety, would leave one hard-pressed to find a man who would reject her, and which, even while front-and-center, is never gratuitous or crude.  Surround her with top-shelf talent, and she can and will go anywhere in film, or in series television; perhaps ABC will reconsider Ainsworth and Jennifer Beals's pilot ""Westside"" on which they foolishly passed.

For all its many good points, the film needed a stronger compass, particularly with regard to what makes Ashley tick, and why she transformed into a good girl without much resistance, but these are minor plot issues that detract very little from an excellent performance in a decent film, one which could have ruined my afternoon off, leaving me feeling like I wasted my $14.98, but which definitely did not.  I highly recommend this film.  My primary question was answered: Lexi Ainsworth is more than capable of carrying a film.  I look forward to her future work.",1380758400,3,5773,4.820486815415822

5851388,1,B00DRQETLA,"This is a terrible movie. It is poorly acted, poorly written and poorly directed. They are misleading people with the title, making you think that it is an uplifting Christmas movie, with the title and people smiling on the cover, when it is just an excuse to preach someone's idea of religion. It really has nothing to do with Christmas at all, except that there is a Christmas pageant at the end. We sat down with family to watch this around Christmas and that was a terrible mistake. Not at all what we were expecting, which would have been OK, if it would not have been just a depressing, worthless excuse for a movie. What a waste of our time. I do not need to be mislead into buying a movie in order to force religion down my throat. Is it possible to give zero stars?",1419811200,,774,4.308219178082192
5851389,2,B00DRQETLA,"So This is Christmas is not the holiday film that the title and artwork suggests--it's a FAITH BASED FILM.  Those three words alone should be enough for most people to decide whether they want to watch it or not.  So This Is Christmas features miserable characters dealing with terrible marriages, alcohol and drug abuse, unwanted pregnancy and crushing guilt--but the burden of these problems would be lifted from their lives if only they accepted Jesus Christ into their lives.

It's a little hard to fathom why faith based films frequently come across as so clumsy and inept--it seems like many times the filmmakers feel that the message is the only thing that matters and that they don't have to concern themselves with the same things as secular filmmakers such as telling an interesting story or creating characters that are believable and dialogue that sounds like it could have come out of the mouths of real people.  The problem is that the message of Christian films is always the same in the end so putting more creative energy into how they get there would go a long way towards making these movies more watchable for audience members not already inclined to believe that all they need in their lives is faith in God.

So This Is Christmas involves a biracial family headed by Bill (Eric Roberts) and Sharon (Vivica A Fox) who seem to be in a horrible marriage without love or even conversations that last for more than a minute and a half.  Bill has a teen daughter  Ashley (a much better than the material deserves Lexi Ainsworth) who is out every night drinking and doing drugs and partying, heading down a path that can only lead to tragedy if she doesn't change her ways.  Sharon has a son Jason (Titus Makin Jr, definitely not rising above the material) who was once a clean-cut track star but whose life is spiraling rapidly down as a result of new friends who introduce him to drugs and breaking and entering.

Daughter Ashley's life changes for the better when a saintly homeless handyman named Mac (Bryan Massey) convinces her to write and help produce a scripture-based Christmas play for adorable young children at the rec center--in fact her life completely turns around overnight, so powerful is the power of Jesus for people who let Him in.  While Ashley's life improves her step-brother Jason's life goes in the opposite direction--he gets beaten up by his new friends when he doesn't have the money to pay for drugs, finds out that his too-good-for-him girlfriend is pregnant and doesn't want an abortion, is forced to steal money, jewelry and the family silver from his oblivious mother and clearly serves as the film's example of what happens if you don't turn to Jesus.

So This Is Christmas is clumsy, heavy-handed and obnoxiously preachy and is unlikely to have much appeal for those who don't already strongly believe that faith in Jesus is the answer for every problem in their lives.  Top-billed Eric Roberts is enough of a pro that he emerges with his dignity completely intact but the same can't be said for many in the supporting cast who give unconvincing, amateurish performances that frequently make the film very difficult to take seriously.  If you are already a fan of faith based movies then you might like So This Is Christmas but it isn't likely to win over any new converts.",1419465600,2,3324,4.770034843205575
5851390,1,B00DRQETLA,"This was a terrible movie, especially for the holidays.  Eric Roberts was the only good thing about the film as a nice father completely disrespected and ignored by everyone.  The wife is angry at him, spends money recklessly and is acted terribly by Vivica A. Fox and totally self absorbed.  The two kids are high schoolers.  The girl is a drunk who dresses like a hooker and does what ever she wants and hangs with another drunken shoplifter.  The son is a drug addicted thief who hangs with drug dealing thieves and has a ""nice"" girlfriend who is pregnant and he wants her to get an abortion.  Don't worry about the baby, she loses that when the two are shot by drug dealers stealing the money earned by a yard sale to help at a children's center Christmas pagent.  There is a tender moment when the son prays to God to save his girlfriend, but he does manage to get the F-word in the prayer along with s--t.  The white father is overly protective of his problem daughter and the African-American mother is overly protective of her son and nobody gets along.  A mysterious small jobs repairman shows up and slowly works on the daughter to try and turn things around.  98% of the movie is crappy with a slight feel good at the close.  Not worth the agravation of watching.  This piece of garbage needs to go in the trash.  Sorry, first Christmas movie I have ever trashed.",1417910400,2,1374,4.469879518072289

5851392,5,B00DRQETLA,"For every review that claims this is too much or not suitable for family, you need to open your eyes to the problems our children and families face today. Drug related deaths are the leading killer of teens and young adults. There has been an increase of over three hundred percent in opiate use alone. Teen pregnancy is as old as time. And our current economic downturn has forced both parents to work just to survive. Our children often pay the price for our absence and we tend to over compinsate due to our guilt.
No this is not a traditional Christmas movie, but it's a very accurate portrayal of what we are now facing. And never kid yourself into thinking it couldn't happen to your family. THAT is what's killing our children. Denial and shame.
I disagree with the majority here and would go as far as to bet you or someone you love will be faced with this reality at some point and these problems no longer discriminate. Denial is killing our children and that is not a happy ending.",1415145600,4,992,4.456043956043956

5851394,5,B00DRQETLA,"I think the description and even the title is a bit misleading as the movie centered more on her brother and not so much on the girl or Christmas. But, it was still an awesome movie that I could easily watch again.",1413331200,,214,4.119047619047619
5851395,1,B00DRQETLA,"As a film buff in general and collector of Christmas films, this film was hard to watch and left a bad taste in my mouth.  I found little if anything uplifting or encouraging during what should be the holiday season of light and of giving.  All I remember was a series of bad attitudes and action including disobedience, drugs, horrible violence, dysfunctional relationships, so much like we see on the news and know about firsthand or from others.  Where were the people of character and changed lives?  Maybe just a hint involving the ""Christmas"" play. Was anything heart-warming?  To me the end of the film was a let down rather than upbeat.  Hm, I'm thinking the title, So,This is Christmas, must be facetious.  It wasn't even a Happy Holiday.  Pass this one by.",1392940800,,766,4.706766917293233
5851405,5,B00DRQETLA,Great movie. Im a sucker for tear jerkers anyway.  I love the story. It will be one that I watch over and over again.,1392076800,2,117,3.875
5851406,1,B00DRQETLA,"I love Christmas movies and bought,""So This is Christmas"", this year to add to my collection. I was so unhappy with it. It really had precious little to do with Christmas, even though it says the daughter is directing a Christmas play, it was too heavy into drugs and teen violence and very depressing!  This movie is so not what I was looking for in a Christmas movie. Sorry I purchased it! Had  I watched it, I would NEVER have bought it!",1388534400,,440,4.353658536585366
5851407,4,B00DRQETLA,"To understand this film, you must set aside visions of a Hallmark or Lifetime Channel happy ending.  This film may not be what many people would expect from a traditional Christmas tale.  It is a story of redemption, and should also be considered a wake-up call for todays generation of parents  not only to the serious issues faced by teens today, but also to the dangers of denial and laissez-faire parenting.

If you are a Christian who would rather not have your children or teens exposed to mature topics, this version of the film is not for your family.  The standard version contains mature scenes, some violence, teen sex and pregnancy, and some profanity.  That being said, it isn't anything not already seen on cable television today.  (There is a cleaner Christian version available.)  If you are a family with mature teens, then this version may generate meaningful conversations about choices and consequences.

This independent film was written, produced, and directed by the husband and wife team of Richard and Deborah Foster.  I very much enjoyed the performances of Brian Massey, Cassidee Vandalia, Danielle Vega and Titus Makin, Jr.  I honestly had never heard of Lexi Ainsworth, as I haven't watched soaps in years.  She delivers a strong performance in this role. Eric Roberts and Vivica Fox, of course, are familiar faces. Ms. Foxs treatment of her character Sharon was heavy-handed, and in some scenes bordered on histrionic.  I found that I began to like Bill (Roberts) more as the film progressed and enjoyed his comic relief in the garage sale and kitchen scenes.

The story initially focuses around Ashleys underage drinking (Ainsworth) but as the story develops, we see that Ashley is not the only person in her family with a problem.  Bill is struggling to keep the family together but is challenged not only by his children, but by his wife Sharons spending habits and focus on her causes outside of the home.  Son Jason takes on manipulation, drug use, and theft.  In the midst of this chaos appears Mac (Massey) as a handyman looking for work.

The film takes on many issues  perhaps too many for the runtime.  The film addresses some of these issues very well and it was interesting to see the characters come to the realization that they had the power within to change their paths.  There are some twists in the plot which added depth, but I found myself wanting to know more about Macs background.  I would have also liked to have seen more back story on the children of the homeless shelter.

Overall this is a solid first effort film with a very talented young ensemble cast.  I watched it twice and found that I liked it much better the second time.  Although the ending is not wrapped up neatly in a shiny red bow (neither is life), the film concludes nicely with a look toward the possibilities of a fresh start.",1388361600,6,2852,4.759674134419552
5851408,4,B00DRQETLA,"I love that this movie was created in our hometown of Tulsa, and the casting, direction, and acting are all good.  Story is pretty good, too, but themes are rather adult, with some language that I would be uncomfortable hearing my grandchildren repeat.

5851409,1,B00DRQETLA,"The back of the DVD is very misleading.  I stopped the DVD after half an hour and destroyed it and threw the whole thing away.  Not a Christian film at all.  Do not waste your money.  The acting was terrible, the story line disgusting and dirty.  I hated wasting my money on trash!!!!!!!",1387497600,2,287,4.339622641509434
5851410,3,B00DRQETLA,"Parents beware!  I bought this movie to show to a group of youth at church, and that wound up being a big mistake.  The description on the back of the box is very misleading.  To read it one would think this is all about a girl who gets involved with the wrong crowd and then turns her life around by helping a group of children put on a Christmas play.  While that may be true, more than half the story involves her brother who is a drug addict involved with a violent gang, and gets his girlfriend pregnant.  There is a very violent scene where the pregnant girl is shot in the stomach and loses the baby, and one of the gang members is impaled with a pair of scissors.  Some of my students watching this scene cringed.  Overall the movie is slow and has nothing to do with Christmas other than the school play which is only a minor part near the end.  Although this may be a decent film to teach the lessons about what teens should not get involved in, it is not a warm fuzzy family story.",1386633600,4,992,4.157068062827225

5851414,1,B00DRQETLA,"Our house is like Christmas Headquarters.  It is the most joyous time of the year, a time when people act a little kinder, attitudes are a bit more gentle and there is just a good spirit in the air.  We love Christmas based movies and have many favorites too numerous to mention.  But we feel a Christmas film should show the hope and spirit that the Season represents.  This movie is none of that.  It is approximately 2 hours long.  We watched it for a little over an hour and a half and finally turned it off, bent the disc and threw it away.  We kept waiting for the movie that was described on the box... ""Everything begins to change when a handyman working on the family's house encourages her to volunteer for a Christmas play with underprivileged children. Ashley finds purpose by helping people in need and uses that to help heal her troubled family. Together, they discover the impact one person can make through the gift of giving.""  All we saw was a very dysfunctional family filled with self centered adults, a teenage girl with a severe alcohol problem (and the troubles it brings) and a teenage son with a heavy coke habit (along with the plethora of vile and vulgar characters you might associate with that).  There is vulgarity in the language as well as in the images.  We turned it off during a rape scene with about a half hour left.  This was just way too much.  This movie is NOT a Christmas movie that offers hope and caring.  It is more of an adult based nighttime soap opera.  The handyman mentioned in the blurb is the ONLY bright spot in the whole film, but he alone could not carry it.  If you turn on this film hoping to find a story of ""...the impact one person can make through the gift of giving"", you will be very very disappointed.  Extremely bad movie, poorly acted, poorly written and very poorly directed.  Take a chance on it if you must, but you have been warned.",1381190400,13,1902,4.419540229885057

This film shows how dishonesty,drug use and alcoholism can destroy families. On the other hand, it demonstrates how love and faith in God can save and strengthen a family.
