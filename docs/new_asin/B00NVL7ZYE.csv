8680469,5,B00NVL7ZYE,One of her best movies.  I can't find it anywhere,1485907200,,49,3.9
8680470,5,B00NVL7ZYE,"Another brilliant performance by two of the best screen stars ever.  I have never seen Mr. Heston turn in anything but excellent performances in any role he assumed.  This is one of two movies he made where he portrayed Andrew Jackson, who (according to historical data) was a stubborn and oft times firey tempered man who eventually became President of the United States.  Mr. Heston portrayed those characteristics in a believable and realistic manner but not to the point of being ""hammy"".  And as for Ms. Hayward, as always her performance as Mrs. Jackson was stellar.  Given the time frame in which this movie was made, the aging special effects of Ms. Hayward were astounding and realistic.  To see her go from a vibrant, beautiful young woman to an old but still attractive aged woman was well done.  If only, as was the case of so many early Hollywood stars,  she hadn't smoked her way through life, the movie going public might not have lost a true movie star so soon to throat cancer.  But thanks to the magic of movies, all the great and real movie stars of yesteryear will live forever for generations to come to enjoy.  If only the studio who holds the movie rights to this old classic would release it here in the U.S.  Listen up studio - there is a ready to purchase audience out here!",1463875200,2,1300,4.560344827586207
8680471,5,B00NVL7ZYE,This is my all-time favorite movie!  I would definitely buy this movie if it was available in US format.  Susan Hayward and Charlton Heston are wonderful and have such chemistry.  Such a great story in America's history!,1443916800,3,220,4.891891891891892
8680472,5,B00NVL7ZYE,"This was an excellent movie. I enjoyed watching this movie very much. Susan Hayward was really good in this movie. She played the part of Rachel Jackson great. The aging process was amazing. There was a lot of action in this movie as well as some comedy and sadness, too. I thought the history was extremely interesting. It held my attention and I will be watching it again.",1443571200,4,374,4.514705882352941
8680473,5,B00NVL7ZYE,"I haven't bought this dvd but it is my very favorite Susan Hayward film and also my favorite Charlton Heston film. It generally follows actual history, there are several deviations from the truth, but it is still a great film. The story is about the seventh president Andrew Jackson and his relationship/marriage to Rachel Robards.  Both stars performed admirably and to me it seemed they really clicked together well on screen.  I've been looking for this dvd for years, they seldom play it on tv.  I'm waiting for it to be made so it can be played on a USA format.  Considering it to be one of these actors' finest films I've always been surprised it's not mentioned more or produced more.  PLEASE PRODUCE THIS FOR USA FANS!",1439683200,7,726,4.640625
