7993662,1,B00009WHT0,"I watched this movie with high exepectations due to Mr. Liu's previous films..

However I was very diapointed, as the quality of the film wasn't even up to the kind of kung fu films that make fun of kung fu films..The plot was implausable and at times disgusting with lots of peeing on each other... The Kung fu itself wasn't even run of mill... to sum it up ridiculous.. don't wast your money...",1118448000,4,396,4.424657534246576
7993663,5,B00009WHT0,"Just when you think one has seen all on the Master Killer,a gem like this comes along!
Gordon plays a monk at Shaolin Temple who is teaching two young kids. They a re naughty and wind up in Hong Kong,where the adventure begins.
Gordon goes looking for them and the action is a terrific blend of classic kung fu mixed with modern day technology.
Gordon's end fight with Shaw villian Wang Lung Wei is worth the price of the DVD alone!
The Shaolin Kids are also terrific,especially with weapons.
The extras include a great documentary on the Shaw Studios hosted by David Chiang.
The DVD is hosted by Shaw Star Philip Ko Fei,who gives a great demonstration and great interview.
Only drawback is the film is presented in fullscreen format.
A definite addition for thge collection.",1063411200,10,775,4.705882352941177
