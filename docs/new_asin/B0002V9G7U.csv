2122830,5,B0002V9G7U,The whole family enjoyed the DVD Warriors of Honor and we are passing it on to family and friends. A good buy.,1234915200,5,110,4.045454545454546
2122831,5,B0002V9G7U,"This is an extremely well made documentary of two of the greatest Generals in the history of this country. I have watched it many times and have even shown it to our church on Sunday evenings. It show the spiritual side of these two great men which you may not see in other Civil War documentaries. It is well worth the purchase price especially for Civil War
buffs. I highly recommend this DVD.

2122832,5,B0002V9G7U,"It has become politically correct to cast slurs and aspersions on all things and men who fought for the Confederacy. It is irony indeed that General's Lee and (Stonewall) Jackson are coming under criticism for fighting to preserve Slavery. Clearly this wasn't true then and isn't now, but if enough people yell it loud enough long enough it achives the same status as the truth.

This film delves in fact, and explains most clearly the motivations of 2 of the Confederacy's most brilliant Generals. It goes behind the common information and deals with the true feelings and spiritual beliefs of the two Heroes. This is something all serious students of the War between the States should be forced to watch, especially the so called history teachers who would be shocked by what they saw. The truth often has that effect on opinions.",1175644800,29,832,4.859154929577465
2122833,5,B0002V9G7U,"Informative, this DVD sets the record straight concerning the Civil War and the provocations behind it.

2122834,5,B0002V9G7U,"An honest look at 2 of the greatest leaders in American History. They were men who and understood the human condition and sought to glorify Christ in all they did . These generals show us that it is not clout, reputation, or prestige that make a great leader, but humility, love for others, and dependence on Christ. It is tragic that no school in america would ever include this in their cirruculum. Even the short featurette's on Slavery and Palmyra are well done. Great quote from the opening section, ""A people that are ignorant of their past are a people that are ripe for deception and manipulation""",1162166400,25,605,4.663551401869159

2122836,5,B0002V9G7U,"As the truth about the South and Confederacy leaks out from the information black-out which the Yankees have had on the subject for almost 150 years the tide of popular and Christian opinion is undergoing change.

This production shows that Ken Burns portrayal of Jackson in ""Gods and Generals"" was on target and illustrates the Souths position, conviction and dedication to truth and Christian Faith. It also shows the devastation of the South and some Yankee war crimes contrasted to the South's chivalric approach to war.

Very well made, and interesting to watch.",1104537600,65,567,5.086021505376344

2122840,5,B0002V9G7U,"As noted in the introduction, the history of the War of Northern Aggression has been written by the northern victors. The war was about state's rights, and slavery became an issue injected and hyped by the north to vilify and gin up hatred toward the south. Slavery, many historians (rather than propagandists) agree, was dying and would likely have disappeared on its own in as little as ten years.

2122849,5,B0002V9G7U,"This isn't your typical, Liberal, whitewashing history of the American Civil War and its genesis. No, this is closer to the reality than many in our overtly politically correct society would like to admit. It humanizes those who were, yes, human, and Americans too. Yes, many were racists, and yes, some were slave owners, but they believed as righteously in the cause for which they were willing to fight and give their lives as Northerners did. History of the American Civil War has largely been appropriated by Northerners that have a penchant for whitewashing, and revising the murky and unpleasant truths of the Civil War. This telling of the war, its causes and its generals' personal convictions on both sides is a welcome reprieve from the blind acceptance we as a guilt ridden society have given to the remade and mythologized version of the war handed down to us by biased academicians and radical reformers with axes to grind. Looking at history through 21st century filters and applying trendy, politically correct explanations is a stupendous disservice to America's most bloody conflict.",1518393600,4,1101,5.088397790055248
2122850,5,B0002V9G7U,"Double meaning in that term, ""Powerful Witness.""  Warriors of Honor is window on minds of the South's two great military leaders of War Between the States era.  Two takeaways for me: 1) the profound religious character of both Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee and 2) the murderous horror of that war.  I had many times encountered stories of the deep faith of Jackson and Lee and statistics on the horrifying death rates of that war but Warriors of Honor drives these realities home like no other. All this in slightly over one hour.

There is one more must-see documentary on the South during the Civil War era that will replay one's close attention: Jefferson Davis: An American President. It's four hours.",1518220800,6,711,4.80327868852459

2122854,5,B0002V9G7U,"Excellent film. Beautifully done. Nicely narrated.
A few minor errors, i.e., while relating the Battle of First Manassas(Bull Run), they show troops flying the Southern Cross, which I understand, was not used until after this battle. And Richmond /Petersburg fell in April, not January, 1865.
One complaint. They omit all but the last battle(Cold Harbor) of the Overland Campaign of 1864, which was Lee's first campaign against Grant.
Regardless, it is superb at capturing the Spirits of Lee and Jackson, and honestly relating their story without rancor.

For people who still wants to believe that J. Davis, R.E. Lee and Jackson fought  for ""states rights"" as a ""culture war"" for ""independance"" in 1861, please read the first lines of the Confederate Constitution...The ""Southern way of life"" that these men fought to keep was one NOT based in God and Country but rather for the institutionalized enslavement of human beings with black skin who were called ""property"".

2122865,1,B0002V9G7U,"It is so one sided, so pro confederacy (everything that Generals Grant and Sherman did was bad) that it's a little horrifying. How could someone in modern times unfailingly praise people who fought to maintain the right to keep slaves, no matter how devout these people were?
  General Lee allowed his soldiers to capture and sell freed people during the war and he had his slaves tortured. Historian Elizabeth Brown Pryor, author of Lee's biography
Reading the Man: A Portrait of Robert E. Lee Through His Private Letters, had this to say about the general in a Q&A interview:
""Lee was considered a hard taskmaster. He also started hiring slaves to other families, sending them away, and breaking up families that had been together on the estate for generations. The slaves resented him, were terrified they would never be freed, and they lost all respect for him. There were many runaways, and at one point several slaves jumped him, claiming they were as free as he. Lee ordered these men to be severely whipped. He also petitioned the court to extend their servitude, but the court ruled against him and Lee did grant them their freedom on Jan. 1, 1863ironically, the same day that Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation went into effect.
Lee's decision to go with Virginia was not inevitable at all. It was very wrenching, and we trivialize it if we say, as some biographers have, that it's a no-brainer, that it was the choice he was born to make. To put it in some context, Gen. Winfield Scott remained with the Union, and he was from Virginia, and so did two fifths of all West Pointers from Virginia.
After the war, Lee was devastated. He was never able to give a candid assessment of his own role in the warwhere he was wrong or could have done things differentlybecause it was too overwhelming. Outwardly, Lee conducted himself with great dignity and was a model of how to endure the unendurable and to stay in Virginiaeven though his wife has lost her home, he has lost a huge number of relatives, and he has not a penny to his name. But beneath the facade, we see some explosive feelings inside. I found scraps of paper, unfinished essays, letters to cousins in Europe with quite a lot of bitterness and anger, which is not the way he has been perceived. He's a disappointed, heartsick man in old age. And it's tragic because he is an appealing figure in so many ways.",1505606400,11,2378,4.65952380952381

Its gratifying to experience and learn of the men who fought for and shaped Americas history.  General's Jackson and Lee are Great Men and Great Americans that first chose to honor God with their lives.  And through God, humbly and honorably serve their Country.  The Civil War was indeed a clash of cultures.  Even today that clash between big city Socialist economics and suburban, rural libertarian leaning capitalism continues.  Generals Jackson and Lee stood in the gap to protect States Rights under the US Constitution and they lost.  I submit, all of America lost as well.  Since the Civil War, America has slipped further and further into a Centrally Managed Socialism and now more Communist (Government Schools, Obama Care) centrally managed Government.  I ordered this movie because I am disgusted by the greed of American politicians breaking their oath to the US Constitution, their constituents, their faith and morals when any mob, or Corporate Donor demands.  These same people, tiller less, lost and propagandized are driving a wedge through the heart of America in the name of their kind of Global Utopia (which is just another name for Hell).  The US Constitution died with great and faithful men such as General Jackson and General Lee.

It goes into detail regarding the strong Christian faith of both men, which was a priority factor in their lives.  With regard to their skills on the battlefield, one must admire their success when always faced with forces twice as large as their's.  I have always felt that if Jackson had not died at Chancellorsville and had been available to help Lee at Gettysburg, the Confederacy would have won that battle.  As Lee responded when he learned of Jackson's wounds and loss of his left arm, Lee stated ""You have lost your left arm but now I have lost my right arm.""

2122876,5,B0002V9G7U,"In ""Warriors of Honor, The faith and legacies of Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson"", we have a DVD highlighting the character of the two most revered symbols of the Confederacy.

In this video, the viewer is introduced to the men beyond the battles. Using historical documents, private correspondence and first-person accounts, this documentary shows these two men as paragons of honor and Christian virtue. While most of the world knows these two men, not just as great American generals but as among the greatest military men in western civilization, few are aware that these great leaders of men during he bloodiest war in their nation's history were men of deep and devout Christian faith.

The DVD obviously chronicles the victories of each of these men as well as a team during the first part of the War Between The States, but also touches on their faith and how their faith propelled them to glory in the name of Christ. We hear narrators give us the words of these two men, their wives, children, fellow soldiers and in many cases their opponents who had great respect for these two foes.

8032536,1,B0002V9G7U,"Its pro southern in the extreme.  It starts out saying how the North basically destroyed the individuality of the south after the civil war.  I'm not gonna hark on how pro southern it is.  I think the main reason people watch documentaries is to learn facts.  This really does gloss over them and omit them badly.

 I've been to VMI you can even read this on the university's website, Stonewall Jackson was a horrible teacher.  He was very intelligent but he was just unable to relate to students and explain things to them in a way they could understand.  He taught natural philosophy which was roughly euqivalent to physics.  It was the 19th century so you'd be lucky to have geometry before taking this course.  I've read that he really didn't understand how to relate to people and if students would ask him questions all he would do is repeat what he had said verbatim.
Anyway, the video just says ""he was a great teacher"" then it goes into his religious views.

Overall the whole documentary just really glosses over things badly.  Hey Ken Burns Civil war is still on Netflix.  It's always interesting to goto a national park.  There are a litany of books you can read.",1521590400,,1175,4.586538461538462

8032539,1,B0002V9G7U,"Poory Done!!!!!!!!!  with no regard for the truth. No research,no clear understanding of the money hunger in R.E.Lee.
Lee had NO training in combat arms. Was a fool in the use of his men,this being why his army had such a high rate of AWOL from the very beganning of his taking over the the Army of Northern Vir.",1520553600,,312,4.288135593220339
8032540,5,B0002V9G7U,Accurately portrayed lives of two great men. I find it amusing that those that hated it are so misinformed and PC in their thinking.,1520380800,,132,4.541666666666667
8032541,2,B0002V9G7U,"Laughable if it wasn't so sadly misguided. If you like your history slanted and biased, here you go. Clearly, this movie was made by people who romanticize and apologize for the South. Certainly, Lee and Jackson had their noble traits, but they were also traitors and were probably responsible for many thousands of unnecessary deaths. Imagine if Lee had followed his better judgment and fought with the Union. The war would have been over rather quickly, and many lives would have been saved. Instead, his ""genius"" meant years of bloodshed--all for nothing.

The most troubling part about this movie is its treatment of slavery. Slavery is hardly mentioned. When it is, slaves are portrayed as happy until they are raped and abandoned by Union soldiers.

If you DON'T want to know the real history of the Civil War, this movie is for you.",1520380800,,839,4.86013986013986
