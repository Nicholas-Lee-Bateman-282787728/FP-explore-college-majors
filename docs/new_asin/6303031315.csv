8679438,5,6303031315,"I have seen this video on digital On Demand twice now. It has been listed under Free Movies a few times. Originally I started watching it as a joke because the title was so hilarious. However, after five or ten minutes of watching, I was hooked. This movie is UTTERLY bad... Everything from the acting, to the script, to the line delivery, to the plot. Everything about this video REEKS. That being said, it is HILARIOUS. Honestly, the funniest movie I have ever seen. I laughed until I cried numerous times. Please, I urge you, look this movie up.",1263686400,3,548,4.545454545454546
