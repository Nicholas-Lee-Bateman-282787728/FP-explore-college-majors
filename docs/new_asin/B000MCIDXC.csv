2728218,5,B000MCIDXC,"I saw the girls in concert and although they were great, I loved to hear them on VH1 Storytellers just because they explain the reasons behind the lyrics.  Can't wait for Blu-ray prices to go down like DVD's did.",1325980800,7,212,4.435897435897436
2728219,4,B000MCIDXC,"I have never seen this group in concert, so that is why I bought it.  They are a talented group of young women and I enjoy every single song.  As for the stories, now that I have heard them once - I will probably just skip over them - they weren't that interesting to begin with - but the songs are great!",1325980800,,305,3.903225806451613
2728220,5,B000MCIDXC,"Ladies PLEASE record more music together!  Watching this concert made me miss you all the more.  The music is great, the editing and composition of the DVD are excellent and the chemistry between the ladies is heartwarming.  I loved learning the backstory behind the songs, but honestly, this DVD is about the performance and the performance is stellar.",1325894400,11,353,5.051724137931035
2728221,2,B000MCIDXC,"I just bought the DVD for about $14.00 at a Wall Mart store, not knowing it was going to be available on Blu-ray. Topping off the aggravation is the high price of the Blu-ray. And one thing that should be considered is there seems to be some sort of technical problem with the picture (at least on the DVD version) as there are frequent jumps where it seems to skip a frame or so. I've seen this often when watching reruns of TV shows, but never before on a DVD. Does the Blu-ray have the same problems?",1325548800,3,503,4.195876288659794
2728222,3,B000MCIDXC,"Big fan of the Home album, know all lyrics by heart. Saw another DVD years ago from or by the Dixie Chicks and liked it. Did not pay attention to the ramble if there was one going on. So I bought this DVD hoping to relive that experience. I either paid no attention to the prior one or it was edited, but the ""talking"" between songs turned me off big time. Singing is what they should stick too.",1324598400,,395,4.076923076923077

2728228,3,B000MCIDXC,"We really enjoyed some the Dixie chicks previous DVD's. The performances were energetic and fun, but since the unfortunate reaction of the ""Bush comment"" I think this performance does suffer from the fallout. They get the songs sung but that's about it. I didn't feel that the performance was engaging and the Chicks didn't seem to be having much fun on the stage. Too bad.",1414022400,,373,4.753846153846154

2728231,5,B000MCIDXC,"Who said women can't rock !!
I am not a real big country fan but I must give credit where it's due, these guys can REALLY sing, play and tear it up.

Absolute musical perfection live, every note, every harmony, in many ways they sound better live than on their studio tracks.
Any musicians out there ? even if it's not what you are normally in to, listen to this band, this is how it's done.

As for the great anti-Bush controversy, while our so-called free press was asleep & spineless Natalie had it right about that lying wastrel W, he's a disgrace to the whole country not just Texas !!. In any other Country he's be in Jail,

 The fact they stuck to their guns despite the death threats and CD burnings and then came out with their BEST album ever which appealed to a whole new more sophisticated mainstream audience,  you go girls, !!  Country Fan Pecker woods, your loss was our gain.",1389225600,3,891,4.36969696969697

2728239,5,B000MCIDXC,"I was never a country music fan but I saw this on Palladium one afternoon and was completely blown away by the vocal harmonies.
The song ""Silent House"" really sold me on this group.
Everything is top notch on this DVD. The musicianship, video, sound and overall performance.
Considering that their careers were derailed for giving their opinions, the music is stronger than the politics.",1346630400,4,387,4.969230769230769

2728241,4,B000MCIDXC,"I like the Dixie Chicks but..........
There was too much story telling, giggling going on before each song. Also, the song arrangements did not have the strength as in the ""An evening with the Dixie Chicks"" DVD. I recommend the latter DVD rather than this one.",1334966400,,260,4.673913043478261

8167879,5,B000MCIDXC,MTV StoryTellers shows are so interesting and this one for the Dixie Chicks during their Grammy comeback time was more than most.  The Blu-Ray master quality was good both visually and the audio.  Very personal stories and great music.,1483574400,,235,5.0

8167885,5,B000MCIDXC,"Can I please give this TEN stars?
More than deserves it!
A personal note.
I became an instant Dixie Chicks fan upon seeing the video of ""Goodbye Earl"" starring NYPD Blue's Dennis Franz as ""Earl"".
""Blue"" was my favorite TV show at the time, in 2002.
Anyway, long story short, I saw them in concert in Vancouver B.C. in July 2003.
So, to be able to see them more often, I bought every concert DVD they put out--Top of the World Tour Live"" and ""An Evening with the DC"".
(I also bought ""Shut Up and Sing"", but preferred the concert DVD's more, with ""Evening"" my favorite--probably because they did such a great version of ""Earl"" on it!)
So I was THRILLED to discover this ""VH1 Storytellers"" DVD of their 2006 appearance!
Bought it from Amazon, and have watched it twice in the past 2 days!
I can't praise this enough!
The sound (on the DVD) is excellent.
The ""Chicks"" look fantastic--more beautiful than ever!
(Love Natalie's hair on this!)
The band is incredible.
The camera is mostly on them (in great close-ups!), but when they scan the audience, you see only loving smiles and hear only loud cheers & standing ovations!
The explanations the DC do for each song are informative, entertaining, and even evoke tears (especially for ""Silent House"" and ""Not Ready to Make Nice"").
You can SEE how emotional it is for Natalie to sing ""House"".
They're funny too.  (Check out what they say about ""So Hard""!)
The DC are about to make a ""comeback"", touring Europe next spring, and maybe the US too!
Another CD on the way?
Let's hope so!
As I said, ""Evening with..."" WAS my favorite DVD of the DC.
While I still LOVE that DVD, this one is so near PERFECT, I know this one will be my ""go to"" video when I need (or want) a DC ""fix""!
The ONLY ""flaw"", if you will, is that ""Goodbye Earl"" isn't on this VH1 Storytellers DVD.
That would have caused me to ask Amazon if I could give it ELEVEN stars!",1446681600,2,1880,4.417867435158501
