8452544,4,B0051CSIU6,"Balance flow goes through several variations of fairly common asanas. I like it as a warm-up for the power flow (which is definitely more challenging). I like the level of difficulty of balance Flow, but I would have preferred a longer version of the workout. Like on her hot body cool mind CD's which are much longer, but you can choose to do a sequence of sections from the workout. Most of this CD seems to be incorporated in the  hot body cool mind level 2. So you probably will do better to get that DVD.",1332028800,9,509,4.302083333333333
