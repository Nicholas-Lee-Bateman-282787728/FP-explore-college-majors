8675035,1,B00MWCOMTE,"This s-called ""documentary"" is actualy Chinese propaganda about Tibet. It is produced by the Chinese Communist Party to convince the world that Tibet was part of China & that there are no human rights violations in Tibet. But there is no historical evidence to support such claim. The Mongol Yuan Empire which conquered China and later incorporated Tibet in the 13th century, did not treat Tibet as part of China & never considered it to be so. Both Tibet & China eventually gained independence from the Mongols. The Ming Dynasty had almost no relations with Tibet. The Manchu Qing Dynasty made Tibet a protectorate of their empire in the 1700s but the Manchus were not Chinese & did not consider Tibet to be part of China. Qing relations w/ Tibet were handled by the Lifanyuan (Bureau of Colonial Affairs) which also handled Mongolian & Russian affairs. Tibet was a colony of the Qing Empire. When the Qing fell in 1911, Tibet regained its independence & held onto it until the PLA invasion of 1949-50. The UN has recognized the Tibetan right of self-determination but the PRC has never allowed Tibetans to exercise that right.",1461196800,,1128,4.819587628865979
8675036,1,B00MWCOMTE,This is propaganda put out by the (very evil) Chinese government. Genocide continues in Tibet and the Panchen Lama is still a political prisoner along with thousands of Tibetans. This is the most vile and shameful of things.,1442016000,,224,4.921052631578948
