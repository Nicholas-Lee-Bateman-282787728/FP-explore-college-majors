Very interesting conceptual artwork. That's what I'll remember most about the movie. That and those who created the aerial warfare scenes actually had an idea of aeronautics. While we know it's movie, it's made in a believable fashion.

I do understand those who found it confusing. Even following along with what was presented at the beginning out was difficult to understand who was who based on their appearances.
Lastly, I am not normally one remembers much less comments on the incidental music, but this was very well done.
If towards the end of the movie you begin thinking of Godzilla, you weren't alone.",1474588800,,674,4.801724137931035

That your peple fight to end a war which doesn't  seem  to  end. That there is a chance that the fighting could end. But at what price. Three members from different groups join togethet.

8726824,3,B01302GZ5I,"The film starts off with a battle and we don't know anything about what is going on. 6 minutes into the film we get an explanation for what appears to be an RPG fantasy game. There was once 8 tribes living on Annon (sp?) created by the god Denown (sp?). When the God left, the tribes who all spoke a different language went to war. (They all speak English now, truly it is a universal language.) There are 3 tribes left. The Briga are the most powerful. They are assisted by the Kumbak who control the information technology. Together they fight the Columba who control the air.

Wydd (Lance Henriksen becasue David Carradine is dead) is a Kumbak who is traveling with the last Druid, a tree talker, who can tie into the ancient knowledge of the gods or something. The tribes fight as clones. When they die, their memory gets downloaded and they are cloned. Our female Columba was a Kiakra 22/23 Khara (Mlanie St-Pierre). Oh yes there is a Basset Hound known as a Gula. If a Gula likes you, you are blessed and it is a sin to kill someone who is blessed by a Gula.

The film uses a 3D CGI background. I imagine all the stiff acting took place in front of a blue screen. The film ends where an equally confusing sequel would commence.

The film asks basic questions about God, life and death. It utilizes philosophy and language from Genesis, but not exclusively. The people collectively who live on the planet are called Garm, hence the title.

This is for the younger generation.

8726827,5,B01302GZ5I,"This film is a cool inflection in a the type of live action cinema, that goes well with Oshii's live action art house matrix film Avalon. So very well done.

There is no way to understand this film on a first viewing, so it is best first viewing to not worry too much on the particulars, and just relax and take in the film as it plays out - that involves a pretty developed fantasy/sci-fi world that the viewer is just thrown into, from imaginative combat scenarios of different kinds, environments that are not entirely clear as to relativity, to characters' motivations and actions that are not readily understood in who they are. So the first viewing is essentially a surreal dreamscape type of narrative.

Mild spoilers follow:
The story is about eternally battling factions of different clones on a world, and one of those battles results in 3 clones from three different factions join together chasing a mystery about their limited consciousness. This co-operation leads to the breaking of the cycle of the old ways in the world, with all the remaining factions learning how to co-operate in a new era for the world. The film ends with a symbol that indicates it may have taken place within some connection to the world of the Avalon movie literally, although certainly thematically it is sharing a similar type of journey.

Overall the film takes place in a very full and advanced imagery of sci-fi/fantasy sequences.

The Dvd of the film has few extras, and would have been nice to be able to watch it with sub-titles also as a couple of small quibbles. Another top sci-fi/fantasy conceptual live action narrative by Oshii, for fans of this type of cinema to appreciate.",1493510400,2,1679,4.759450171821306
