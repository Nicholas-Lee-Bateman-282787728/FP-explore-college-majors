Children of Syria

  It is sad when a person running for the United State President have no clue about Aleppo; the epicenter of the Syrian refugees, and the centre of a lot of people's concern across the planet because of the terrible humanitarian crisis that has been unfolding in Aleppo. A PBS frontline documentary about the children of Syria, published on July, 24, 2016 is evidently the documentary to take one through a transition over the course of time in war torn Syria.
  This documentary based on a true story talks about a family's life in Aleppo and how the war has blocked the future of the children. It follows the family for about three years whiles filming this documentary. Abu Ali, an engineer risks the life of his family to fight for the country he loves and appreciate. When the war started he gathered rebel fighters and stood firm in Aleppo even it meant risking the life of his family and the future for his kids. Everything was fine, even though they experienced massive gunshots and shellings from the Syrian Army everyday, until Isis just arrived in Aleppo and spoiler alert: kidnapp Abu Ali.
  It now seems like all hope is lost for his four children, Mohammed, Helen, Farah, Sarah and their mother. Have to leave Syria when they hear about the Germans taking about 2000 Syrian refugees. They cross the border to Turkey while they seek for asylum. Their visas ultimately are approved after two months in Istanbul. The family then move to Goslar, Germany where they are supported financially by the government and where the children can have a better future.
  Some people claim there is no hell, but to me there is. Why should we search for hell somewhere else when other people are experiencing it each and everyday in Syria. And hell is only four hours away in Aleppo where childrens cries drown out the explosions of mortar bombs until they lose their voice, their families, and their limbs. And hell is when missiles are being fired on people everyday and many people seems not to care. In all i think this documentary did an outstanding job showcasing the everyday life for the average Syrian in Aleppo and how things can change for people in a matter of time. I liked this documentary because, it gives the description of the whole situation in Aleppo in just an hour. To an average person who doesn't know anything about the Syrian War and its effects on the people of Syria and how humanity has lost its meaning in Aleppo, this is the documentary to watch. Watching this documentary will make one appreciate life and whatever they have, because just putting yourself in the situation of the Syrians would make one be thankful for whatever they have.
  This documentary shows people that the Syrian refugees are not harmful and that they shouldn't be made to suffer for the evil doings of their government. I would recommend this documentary to any islamophobes, so that they can get a perspective of the struggles of the refugees go through before escaping to an asylum. The only problem I had with the movie was that this is only the story of one family, this is one of thousands of stories that still need a voice.",1485907200,3,3203,4.701785714285714
8756726,5,B01DRWB74K,"Next time when your kid wants something, anything at all, and for some reason or another you want to relay the message that he/she needs to be content with what he/she has but you can not find the right words or the right dialog for some reason or another, then try watching this documentary with he/she. Infact watch documentary before getting to that point since being able to wake up in a place called home sweet home, in one's birth country with much to explore and experience life in peace for the rest of one's life is the basic principle of a lucky human life. How these journalist followed this family for three years in order to make this documentary is simply amazing. It will be very interesting to see what happens to these four kids in next few years especially for the eldest daughter. Her physical attributes may be more of a hindrance, confusion and disappointment than blessing in a strange country with different traditions without herself knowing or having any elder, a wiser responsible party guiding her through the challenges of a teenage life accordingly.

This is a must see documentary about life, happiness, freedom, safety, appreciation, existence and biggest feeling of all... SENSE OF BELONGING... Bravo, bravo, bravo.",1463184000,5,1247,4.909952606635071
