8615550,5,B00FG9YRDG,"This has got to my the capstone of Phil's career.  To win the ""Open"" was the most difficult golfing challenge Phil ever faced and he came through like the great champion that he is.  Well done!",1496102400,,193,4.333333333333333
8615551,2,B00FG9YRDG,"The DVD cut out Phil's birdie putts. A lot in my opinion. At least, you should have all birdies in the back 9 on Sunday. Big disappointed.",1389139200,2,138,4.148148148148148

8615555,5,B00FG9YRDG,"Fantastic ! Can't watch it enough !  Phil coming from 5 back and beating Woods, Scott , Westwood and Stenson by 3 shots is great theater!!  They should have included Phil's  Sunday victory press conference though.",1386547200,2,213,4.861111111111111
