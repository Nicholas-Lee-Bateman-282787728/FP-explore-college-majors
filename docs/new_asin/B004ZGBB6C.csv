8449745,1,B004ZGBB6C,"I love Joan Jett!  But this movie is hideous, cheesy and just stupid.  Ugh, where are these reviews coming from.  Do not waste your time!",1339113600,,137,4.4
8449746,4,B004ZGBB6C,"I bought this DVD for the sole reason that Joan Jett was in it. Unfortunately she wasn't in the film as much as I'd hoped she'd be, but it was still a pretty good movie. It took me a little bit to get used to the way it's shot, the camera style, I guess it would be, but I enjoyed it. Also really enjoyed the outtakes and making of the movie in the special features, shows some more of Joan Jett and was fun to watch. Good movie and worth it especially for JJ fans!",1319414400,7,465,3.905263157894737
8449747,5,B004ZGBB6C,"Hello people ""Tick Tick"" here. Like the bomb not the bug. I was supposed to be Joan Jetts boyfriend. I am the big blonde guy with the tattoos at the bar scene in this movie when she dances on the bar. The last time I saw this was at the showing in NYC after it was completed. Where I told Rocco I should have had more scenes. I was good. I never got a copy so I am just buying it now. I get no respect. Sure glad I am getting a copy finally. They cut some of my stuff out so I hope at least what was in it at the showing is still there. But it says the deleted scenes are on this DVD. Anyway if Joan, Roy or Rocco see this ""Hi Joan"", ""Hi Roy"", ""Hi Rocco"" its Axel! Cheers",1316044800,5,671,3.699300699300699
8449748,3,B004ZGBB6C,Not the best movie I have ever seen but if you are a Joan Jett fan it's a must see!  For me she was really the highlight of this movie.  The outtakes and the bridesmaid's dress were worth the price of the dvd!,1315180800,2,209,3.8372093023255816
8449749,5,B004ZGBB6C,"For a Fan of Joan Jett, this movie will give you new insights into her personality. Yes, it's only a movie and not real life, but Joan is there with her Jersey/York accent and that smile that is all hers. You can see in her eyes that she is really into acting the part. The out-takes should have been in the movie and not cut, but that's show biz. I don't remember much about the story line, I only watched to see Joan at her best doing what she enjoys. This movie is a must for the true Fans of Joan Jett. Also see Joan in The Light of Day, another good film for Jett Fans.",1314316800,4,574,3.956896551724138
8449750,5,B004ZGBB6C,I lovew this movie for the reason is i love Joan Jett that is the main reason i bought this movie,1313280000,2,97,3.6666666666666665
8449751,5,B004ZGBB6C,"This is a great indie flick, nice story, exceptional acting and a really sweet story. Joan Jett is a really good actress, I wish she would do more. She is Hilarious as the hard ass vixen roomate who has a CRAZY sexual encounter with the lead male. A Blind Date gone horrid! Barbara S who i have never seen before to me is a cross between Parker Posey and Martha Plimpton, but a MUCH better Actress. Her performance is great. She is funny, tender, dramatic and sensitive. I would look for other movies and watch just because she is in them. If you want a light and fluffy movie this isn't it, but if you want a realistic movie about complex relationships pick this one up. You won't be sorry.",1310947200,2,691,4.323076923076923
8449752,4,B004ZGBB6C,"Duane L. Martin, Rogue Cinema:

This is an indie style film, and to be honest, it looks damn good visually for a film that was shot on video.  On every technical level, this was a really well made film that had some excellent camera work, lighting and sound, and was paced quite well throughout.  The film and the story are enjoyable, and some of the performances in the film, most notably Robert Mobley's portrayal of Frankie, are really well done and engaging.  I think that most people who sit down to watch this one will feel pretty good about the experience.  This release is being put out by Synapse, who have long been known for the quality of their releases. This one is no exception. As I said above, the visual quality is great, and it comes with several special features, including audio commentary, a ""making of"" featurette, deleted and extended scenes, outtakes and the theatrical trailer.",1310428800,5,902,4.719745222929936
8449753,3,B004ZGBB6C,"Judge Paul Pritchard, DVD Verdict -- ""Echoes of Woody Allen (Annie Hall), and a touch of Richard Linklater (Before Sunrise) are evident throughout The Sweet Life, but this ""romantic comedy...for people who hate romantic comedies!"" fails to deliver on its promise. Indeed, while the dialogue is generally good, the film's narrative arc is pretty much a bust and walks similar ground to the mainstream movies it seemingly detests. Brothers Michael and Frankie, who are chalk and cheese, are really no more different than the love rivals of any rom-com, with one loud and obnoxious, the other refined and more introverted. It's not too much of a stretch to draw comparisons to Colin Firth's and Hugh Grant's roles in Bridget Jones's Diary. Writer/director Rocco Simonelli's screenplay is full of quick-witted dialogue that is both the movies strong point and its major failing. The comedy is generally quite broad, and relies on characters shouting obscenities a little too much. Jokes are less than subtle, with the setups telegraphing the punch line from a mile off. Despite some good work by the cast, with Lorinz being the standout, The Sweet Life is not the radical take on the romantic comedy it sets out to be. Simonelli clearly has a knack for strong dialogue--even though he drops the ball occasionally--making the film a not entirely horrible experience. With such lofty ambitions, it's impossible to consider The Sweet Life anything other than a letdown. The DVD comes complete with an audio commentary featuring director Rocco Simonelli, and actors James Lorinz and Barbara Sicuranza. The track is a good blend of insights and amusing anecdotes. A making of featurette and deleted scenes are also included.""",1310342400,,1716,5.154121863799283
