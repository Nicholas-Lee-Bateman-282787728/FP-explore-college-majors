6132267,5,B00H4Q332K,"After paying her rent 6 months in advance, Cheng Liang Liang, receives a court notification that her home will be seized. New owner of the house, Qi Yi, moves in (it's his childhood home, full of memories.) and tries to kick Liang Liang out of the house, but she refuses to leave until her lease is done in 3 months. The same day, Liang Liang finds out that Qi Yi is her new boss. Two of Liang Liang's coworkers are about to get engaged in the office that day until the new boss posts a sign that forbids office romance. Anyone who disobeys this rule is fired. So the engagement is broken off. Liang Liang and her friends decide to take revenge by having Qi Yi fall in love with her, so he will allow office romance again.

Even though she shares the office space during the day and their house during the night, her plan of revenge won't be easy. They're total opposites. Liang Liang is a postive, naive, never-give-up kind of girl and Qi Yi is controlling, logical, and completely organized down to every detail. Plus, an old love of Qi Yi shows up to get him back and targets Liang Liang as her enemy and tries to get her fired. Also a rival of Qi Yi appears and falls for Liang Liang.

This is such a great romantic comedy with lot's of likable characters and funny and heartfelt moments. It's a must see. The more I watched this show the more I liked it. The complete series is 21 episodes and the English subtitles are good.",1387152000,5,1430,4.312267657992565
