Love biographical stories, especially musical ones.  Also, love the songs from the Thirties to the Sixties. Any movie starring Paul Newman is a must for me. Saw them all at their time of release and now have many in my collection to replay at my leisure, thanks to Amazon.",1242691200,,402,4.583333333333333
642082,4,6303406971,"An excellent print of a movie that has been obscure for too many years.  Newman (not always the brilliant actor many claimed he was) fills the bill superbly.  And Blyth, carrying a difficult, clich-ridden role, does a fine of making Morgan credible and sympathetic.
A major pleasure in this film is the soundtrack of Gogi Grant singing for Ann Blythe which I have always considered to be one of the finest ""female vocal"" albums of the 50's.",1240099200,2,440,4.701298701298701

The MOVIE is without a doubt one of the best tear-jerkers ever made. Paul Newman literally jumps off the screen and becomes a star of the highest order. His performance sticks with you AND EVERY FRAME of film is better than the one before.  This is a film that will touch every nerve in your heart and soul.",1234915200,,474,4.031914893617022
642086,3,6303406971,"The Helen Morgan Story is a formula biopic with equal parts soap, song and gin. The thing that makes it stand out are three very good performances and a wonderful parade of vintage 1920's hits voiced for the star by Gogi Grant.
  From the moment the film begins to unreel with its Broadway marquee titles you know you are in for a good old-fashioned tearstained campy drama. Loosely based on the life of Helen Morgan, who is most famous today for creating the role of Julie in the groundbreaking ""Show Boat"" in the 20's. The film centers on her rise and fall as well as her unrequited love for gangster Larry Maddux.
  Playing the title role is Ann Blyth who does her best to give Helen all the pathos, drama and tragedy required in such a story. She does a fine job but one can't help but recall her best work as Veda in Mildred Pierce. Some years earlier.
  The real stars of the show are comedian Alan King, TV star Cara Williams and a new guy to pictures by the name of Paul Newman. These three pros take a filmland formula and mix it until it explodes.
  Alan King is quite a fine actor as well as a gifted comedian. He imbues the character of Benny Weaver, Larry's partner with life and humor. As Helen's best friend and Benny's moll Cara Williams shines.
  But the best performance is given by a very young Paul Newman who shows us just what he could do with the good for nothing huckster role. He soars in the role and gives us a preview of some of the better roles he will fill out in the future from Fast Eddie to Hud.
  The black and white cinematography by Ted D. McCord is stunning as are the sets and costumes. And the Warner Brothers orchestra makes the mono soundtrack burst its boundaries to near stereophonic sound. The dirction by Michael Curtiz who had been making films since 1912 is solid and dependable.
  One hopes that there may be a DVD release of this film in the future.

(February 18, 2009) And now it is out on DVD in all it's Cinemascope glory. It looks great and the sound is full and gorgous. A must have for any Paul Newan fan as well as fan's of great old standard songs from the 20's.",1083888000,44,2120,4.291457286432161
642087,4,6303406971,"Ann Blyth stars as ill-fated torch singer Helen Morgan in the musical biography THE HELEN MORGAN STORY (1957).  The movie follows the life of the tragic 1920s songbird from the heights of acclaim in the original Broadway production of ""Show Boat"" to her dramatic battles with depression and alcoholism.

Inspired by Polly Bergen's searing performance as Morgan in a ""Playhouse 90"" TV special which aired earlier that same year, producer Jack Warner geared THE HELEN MORGAN STORY as a showcase not for actress Ann Blyth, but rather the popular singer Gogi Grant, whom he employed to supply Blyth's voice for the musical numbers--if the truth be known, Blyth's own singing would have sufficed.

In the tradition of a backstage soap-opera, the more tawdry facts of Morgan's life were glossed over (the ""Playhouse 90"" screenplay reflected Morgan's life in a more accurate light, having Morgan's mother Lulu as a consultant).  Paul Newman plays her stormy boyfriend; Blyth shines (especially in the recreations of the ""Show Boat"" stage production), and the soundtrack springs to life with such Morgan standards as ""Why Was I Born?"", ""Bill"", and ""Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man"".

The supporting cast includes Richard Carlson, Gene Evans, Alan King and Cara Williams.  Directed by Michael Curtiz.  Recommended.",1001635200,12,1299,5.246376811594203

642257,2,6303406971,"The only good thing about this movie is Paul Newman. His acting stands far and above everybody else's. There is zero chemistry between Newman and Ann Blyth. She is miscast and comes across awkwardly during the whole movie. She's totally unbelievable as she tries to portray Morgan and the drama and vices Morgan went through. The script doesn't do much to really develop the backstory of Morgan or what she actually experienced during her life. This movie was/is for the generation that already knew her story. For contemporary audiences, reading a biography of Morgan is more informative and entertaining than this movie.",1345766400,3,622,5.107843137254902
642258,5,6303406971,"Just watched this again - after however many years it has been since it first came out.
The great thing is that you get to see Ann Blyth, who still looks just as beautiful now as she did then (imagine that!) and you also get to hear Gogi Grant, who may be the best girl singer to ever come along.
But Ann Blyth makes it look totally believable, as she really looks as if she is actually singing the songs.
She isn't, of course, but that's what acting is all about - to make you believe the unbelievable.
Anyway, it's a great movie, and if you haven't seen it before, you really should.",1332547200,,585,4.185840707964601
642259,5,6303406971,"""The Helen Morgan Story"" is one of those great older movies that they just don't make anymore.  The stars are beautiful (Ann Blyth & Paul Newman), the acting is wonderful, the music is great...it is a wonderful movie depicting the life of a musical great.  Why they didn't use Ann Blyth's voice is beyond me though.  They thought someone with a beautiful voice like hers couldn't sing torch songs?  Paul Newman is great as Helen Morgan's lover.  I was a kid but I still DO remember the original Playhouse 90 broadcast with singer Polly Bergen portraying Helen Morgan, who was also wonderful.  I recommend this movie to anyone who likes good acting and good music, because that's what you'll get when you watch ""The Helen Morgan Story"".",1291593600,,735,4.748031496062992
642260,3,6303406971,"The reason I purchased this video was this is my mothers Mom.  She was adopted at birth but was told later that Helen Morgan was her real mother.  So I wanted to see it but they did not mention the baby she had out of wedlock in 1926 and gave up for adoption. It was an interesting movie, mainly because  Paul Newman was in it.  When my 84 mother watched it she was singing along with the movie.  (she is a pretty good singer herself)",1285372800,,434,4.0588235294117645
642261,4,6303406971,"Helen Morgan was a torch singer from the 1920s and 30s. She was well-known for her sappy ballads, and went on to play Julie, the tragic mulatta in Show Boat. Her addiction to alcohol ruined her career, but she was a very big star in her day. This is a celebration of her life and musical career.

There are many problems. One, it completely ignores Morgan's film career. Next, although Ann Blyth has short dark hair and emotional eyes, she is much too beautiful to play Morgan, who got very fat toward the end of her career. Also, the film makers alternate between authentically portraying the 20s with costuming and vocabulary and completely disregarding the period and making everything look like the 50s. This is distracting. Finally, neither Morgan's voice or Blyth's is used for the musical numbers. Gogi Grant, a singer whose voice resembles Judy Garland's in maturity, dubs the songs, and she sounds nothing like Helen Morgan. Morgan's voice was more subdued and filled with a quiet passion. The dubbing was a bad choice and detracts a great deal from the tribute to Morgan.

That being said, this is still an entertaining movie. Blyth does a good job toggling between the emotional highs and lows of Morgan's life. She carries the movie well. Paul Newman is very good as her attractive loser boyfriend. His charisma makes him a likable character in spite of all the bad things he does. The music is outstanding, from the songs that Grant sings to the ones that are played in the background. This is really a film for music lovers, and it delivers.

3 1/2 Stars",1282176000,4,1568,4.7153284671532845
642262,5,6303406971,I just loved this love story.  I used to see it with my mom that has sinced passed away and can't help remembering her and I singing all the beautiful love songs from the move.  Paul Newman is at his very sexiest even though you never see an explicit love scene. That was the good thing about the old movies.  They let us use our imagination (and we can get very creative!). You don't know how long I waited to be able to order this movie.,1273363200,,439,4.0813953488372094
642263,5,6303406971,"The Helen Morgan Story is a 1957 American biographical film based on the life and career of torch singer/actress Helen Morgan. Morgan (Ann Blyth) begins her career as a Chicago carnival dancer and catches the eye of fast-talking, double-dealing Larry Maddux (Paul Newman), whose promotion catapults her to fame as a Broadway performer in Show Boat and a headliner in her own nightclub. She anguishes over her romantic relationships with both him and Russell Wade, a wealthy, married attorney. When she realizes the caddish Maddux merely has been using her to support the upscale lifestyle he has come to enjoy, she turns to drink. She loses the bulk of her money to the Bureau of Internal Revenue and the Wall Street Crash of 1929, hits rock bottom, and is hospitalized in the alcoholic ward in Bellevue. Maddux has a change of heart and arranges a gala testimonial dinner, hosted by Walter Winchell and Florenz Ziegfeld, in her honor. The film's ending suggests this was Morgan's first step on the road to recovery, success, and happiness, which was not the case in real life. This movie has everything and will on the heart strings of the viewer because of the tragic life she leads and the love the crippled her at fist than saved her in the end.",1266883200,,1249,4.76036866359447
642264,5,6303406971,I had never seen this movie until I bought it at amazon.com. Loved the movie...big Paul Newman fan. Ann Blyth is as beautiful as ever.,1260921600,,134,4.4
642265,4,6303406971,"The magnificent voice of Gogi Grant at the peak of her considerable powers may be the best thing about ""The Helen Morgan Story."" The story of her life as depicted here (based on a TV play that starred Polly Bergen, and wouldn't that be fun to see on DVD!) is largely fictionalized, with even some actual events (Helen was actually voted ""Miss Mount Royal"" when she was studying voice in Canada in the mid-'20s; here, the contest is a set-up somehow tied in with a bootlegging scheme!) turned into melodrama. On the plus side: stunning B&W widescreeen photography; snappy direction by Michael Curtiz; wonderful supporting turns from Cara Williams and Alan King and a fine performance from star Ann Blyth, who somehow manages to make it all believable. Then there is rising star Paul Newman, channeling Clark Gable in his lady-killer period, as the no-goodnik hood who bewitches and bedevils the fragile singing star. Newman mainly glowers his way through a part that he doesn't seem to care for, as was the case with many of his earlier roles (see - or better still don't see - ""The Silver Chalice""), but his sex appeal is rampant.

Now for the good stuff: the music. Morgan introduced or performed many outstanding American songs from the golden age of 1926-1933 and many are represented here, recorded on the best sound-stage in Hollywood, with magnificent arrangements by Ray Heindorf and his staff, and featuring Gogi Grant, who receives full screen credit and was pictured on the cover of the best-selling soundtrack album (RCA were no fools: she had just been voted Most Popular Female Singer of 1956 and this was her first major release on their label). Ironically, Grant's voice bears little resemblance to that of Helen Morgan, whose voice was high and sweet but lacking in power, with a wide, expressive vibrato, although her sensitive reading of a lyric more than compensated for her rather limited range. It was Morgan's ACTING ability that helped make her a star and that gave theatergoers such indelible memories of her performances.  Gogi's voice has tremendous power and range, and her version of ""Why Was I Born"" will simply blow you away, yet she sings with delicacy and nuance on songs like ""April In Paris"" and, of course, ""Bill"" (performed here in a nightclub sequence since MGM would not permit any scenes from ""Showboat"" to be used in a Warners' film, depriving us from seeing what was truly the high point of Morgan's career).

As I write this, a two-CD set of Gogi Grant's RCA recordings has just been released, and hopefully the availability of this film on DVD will prompt a new generation to explore the recorded work of this magnificent singer.",1259107200,7,2672,4.855263157894737
642266,2,6303406971,"This is an incredibly dated and white washed portrait of Helen Morgan, interesting for really only one reason, as an old time movie star meets a new breed star of the 50s. Ann Blyth was at the very end of her movie career, even though she probably didn't realise it at the time, she had just been let go from her MGM contract and saw this vehicle as a chance to shine in a dramatic role after being a coquettish heroine in films such as ""Rose Marie"" and ""The Student prince"" (Her musical movies have mostly been ignored by DVD)Unfortunately she did not prove capable of the requirements of the cliched role and never made another movie and Newman who was a star on the rise acts her off the screen in a role that helped launch his burgeoning movie career.
