8597578,5,B00DTL6VKU,"A stunning South Korean adaptation of Japanese writer Keigo Higashino's ""The Devotion of Suspect X,"" this film surprised me.  A great level of suspense and a murder mystery where you know who the murderer is from the very beginning on the movie. Lots of great performances and twists and manages to pack an emotional punch at the same time.  Those familiar with the source novel may be disappointed in some of the changes made in this movie, but the changes serve the movie very well and still manage to support the original novel amazingly well.",1494633600,,546,4.7368421052631575
