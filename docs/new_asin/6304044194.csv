Not only the best horror movie of all time, but the best movie of all time.  The only downside is that it's so well done that no other movie can compare. Sadly, I will never enjoy another movie as much as this one.",1079654400,3,355,4.253731343283582
776296,5,6304044194,"Just look at the title...LOOK AT IT!!!  You know this isn't really a horror movie.  And when the movie opens with a sign for the ""Starbody Health Spa"" shorting out so that the only letters lighting up spell ""______d_ _ea_th Spa"", you know you're in for a comedic treat.  Featuring the man who's chest spurts forth cherry kool-aid, the incredible melting woman, the hand eating blender, the ever amazing disappearing/reappearing hand trick, and a wonderful cameo by the overhead microphone.  This movie never ceases in the laughter department (unfortunately, I don't think they intended it that way) And don't believe all the hype about the gore, which is very humorous (but alas, not good) nor the sex (Nudity is not sex!)...the only real star of this movie is the attack of the frozen fish!  The greatest part of the entire movie.  Pure hillarity!  Here's our little canundrum...how does a ghost that takes control of the main computer at a spa (which can I guess concievably control an exercise machine and a blender) assume control of a frozen fish and have it attack the throat of a man?  Don't over-analyze this...just watch it and laugh.  The funniest, non-humorous movie of all time.  Grab your popcorn and enjoy.  VIVA LA DEATH SPA FISH!!!!",1067126400,8,1248,4.867298578199052

776448,5,6304044194,"Sometimes you just need something that is brilliantly executed Z-grade trash. Death Spa (which announces itself by showing us in the opening shot of the film an exterior of the front of the ""Starbody Health Spa"" and when lightning strikes the building it leaves only the word ""d-ea-th spa"") is one such a MOVIE (not a film, a movie, of course), and it has some little nibblets in its DNA from Psycho and (near the end) Carrie, but is its own piece of wonderful garbage. It's a laugh riot for about half the time, and for the other half you can at least enjoy the stone-faced 'acting' from William Bumiller as the owner of the Spa-that-kills, Michael Evans.

How does this spa killed? For sure, I wouldn't reveal *that* to you, would I? A big clue can be found in the control room where the major-league, over-the-top, why-is-this-doing-that electrical engineering and technical overriding is like if HAL decided to take Olivia Newton John's advice from her early 80's music video. David runs this room and is super tight-assed, though there's more to come from him during the course of the movie. To say more than that would be more than a spoiler - it would be downright cruel to give that juicy bit of plot exposition.

I think if I had one major complaint is that only, I don't know, 65% of the film takes place at the Death Spa(?) Psshaw, it should've been more than that, like who cares about Michael's house and what goes on there? The key thing is that there are wonderful, consciousness-expanding murders that go on at the spa; the first attack on a naked female character is getting a steam and gas pours into the room that she can't get out of right away is the most disturbing (TMI, I flashed to the holocaust during that one moment, but that's my fault). Then we get into... girls in a shower also getting chlorine-gas blasted and tiles shooting out at them, machines making, for example, a guy's arm so tightened and intense that his ribs crack out; boiling water creams a girl, literally, into a basement floor; the whole finale/climax which features, among other kills, a guy locked in a freezer and a fish comes alive and attacks his neck... ouch.

Death Spa includes a sub-plot involving the murder investigation by two hilariously ""movie"" cops (both kind of inept and dumb, somewhat, kinda, I don't friggin know), and the main character, Michael, being haunted in his dreams by his dead former wife who killed herself by dousing herself (on a wheelchair) in kerosene and lighting herself on fire while all the same still, uh, having sex with seemingly so many girls at the spa (plus his girlfriend, the woman from the opening of the film who becomes temporarily blinded by the attack on her). There's also the continuing question as to what is killing people at the spa, why, say, it isn't shut down, what happened to the one black girl who gets it very bad in the locker room, and a Mardi Gras party that seems to not make much sense given all of the things happening there. Hey, it's haunted/possessed/supernatural/dangerous, why not have a, uh, Mardi Gras/quasi-Halloween party at a SPA(!?)

I think what made me like this so much is that the filmmakers do commit to the premise enough to make it totally entertaining; you know watching it it has a few jobs to do: make it gory, make it filled with sex (there's some rather ODD spots though, like when Michael feeds his girlfriend a piece of asparagus in what's meant to be a sensual way, unironically), and make it filled with characters that can keep our attention. Not to mention, if you like your 80's (mid to late 80's) cheese and sleaze, and violence that is intentionally going for broke for the gore effects, then this is for you. It comes out somewhere in-between being something that is not really *good*, but it's also not trying to be so over the top that it becomes something else, like The Toxic Avenger, which, as you may recall, also took place in a health spa/gym type of place for part of it. To give you an idea of what this movie is: it beats Tommy Wiseau by about 15 years in having two characters throwing a football around, you know, because have two guys throw a football, it's fun!",1477785600,,4177,4.587684069611781

This health spa is hilarious and most of the deaths that occur are physically impossible.  I thoroughly enjoy the outlandish ways people die here and the relatively mediocre acting involved. Most of the victims in this movie are being punished by a spirit for no obvious reason other than her being a jerk.

It's a film to watch with friends to see over the top gore, but characters that just make no sense in the real world. Was surprised to learn it was Merritt Butrick's last credited film. Did enjoy seeing Chelsea Field in the film. So it was worth watching once. But in no hurry to ever see it again any time soon.

Have to give ""How Did This Get Made"" credit for finding this best of the worst Holloween Film of all time.

776515,5,6304044194,"And I loved it.

This is a hodge podge of horror movie cliches of the time, and an overall celebration of 80's cheese.  The story line, and it's numerous pointless subplots are laughable at best.  But it's still a fun ride.

Basically it's about an all electronic health club, and a series of accidents that have people questing why it's happening.  Of course the movie does reveal early on that it is in fact a ghost doing all the misdeeds, so the investigation portions, as well as the scheming by the co owners of the spa to wrest control of the building are all completely pointless diversions.  But hey, gotta pad that running time.

It does rip off several horror genre classics.  But in execution it rips those movies off in a fun way.  The numerous ways people get offed in this film are oftentimes creative, and have a shockingly decent practical effects to go along with it.

The funny thing about the effects is that some of them would be genuinely creepy and horrific if the movie itself wasn't so silly in execution.  If you took some of the scenes in the movie and put them in a movie with a more serious tone, they'd be quite unnerving.  Which for a movie like this, is the best compliment I can give it's special effects.

This is by no means a classic film.  The story and characters are dumb.  But it's a fun watch if you like to laugh at bad movies.  There is a fair bit of nudity in the film though, so you might want to screen it for group viewing first.  Otherwise, yeah, it's a great sit through with a group of people who like to laugh at bad films.  So if this sounds interesting to you, then check it out.",1446076800,4,1631,4.309210526315789

776685,2,6304044194,"I hadn't heard of this before until it came up in a recommendation on Amazon. Sadly there was a good reason for me not having seen it...it's pretty awful!

Story goes something like this...a state-of-the-art health spa suddenly becomes accident prone and it's customers meet with hideous fitness-related accidents and deaths. Seems like the fully automated, computer controlled system is being controlled by a mysterious prescence! Who is to blame? Who will be next? Let me spoil this for you...you won't care.

Death Spa is hilariously dated, and it shares a similarity with ""Evilspeak"", which also used computers as a ""means of supernatural manifestation"", but just raises giggles when viewed today (sadly I presume this future obsolescence was not apparent at the time). Death Spa has forgettable characters (several of whom look the same), confusing motivations, a really silly true culprit, and really bad gore scenes which seem to be attempting the ""operatic deaths"" of more stylish horror movies of the era (late 80s). The fim makers do attempt to gross you out with prosthetic heads and body parts but they just aren't very good...one decapitation scene leaves behind a body that appears to be just a costume draped over a broom.  Sadly nothing really works, and even if you forgive the sniggering at the dated 80' computer wizardry, and the cringeworthy 80's fitness fashions, the film still doesn't deliver.

Titles a++",1404950400,,261,4.458333333333333
776687,4,6304044194,"SPOILER ALERT!  This movie sucks!  There, I said it.  But I also managed to enjoy it for its immensely funny levels of holy crap awful.  ALTERNATE TITLE:  Evidently, this movie is also called Witch Bitch..or so the opening credits suggest.

POV shots to weird sound effects, nudity within the first five minutes and a sultry Flashdance routine immediately warn of the quality of the movie to come.  Our flashdancing spa exhibitionist is Laura (Brenda Bakke; Nowhere to Run, Tales from the Crypt: Demon Knight) and she is nearly killed when the gym sauna spews caustic gas out of some pipe--clearly in an effort to murder her...because spas do that in this movie  But have no fear, she judo chops to safety through a window and then passes out naked and sweaty before our eyes.

This spa looks like the 80s vomited all over it.  Super short shorts on allegedly straight guys with feathered hair, girls in provocatively snug unitards, lots of hairspray, tights, promiscuity, atrocious movie scoring, legwarmers and a strangely wardrobed black dude (Ken Foree; Dawn of the Dead, The Lords of Salem, Halloween, From Beyond) who the director clearly decided was ""tough"" because he's a tall black dude.

As the ""spa"" continues to strike, its assaults include tampering with a diving board, scalding hot showers and projectile bath tiles flying at naked women, a busted hot water pipe melts the face off of some chick and a needlessly deadly chest-fly machine kills some dude.  Not surprisingly it only takes a few free months of gym membership from the gym owner Michael (William Bumiller; Species) for people to keep coming to the gym where several people have been serially  killed or injured in the past week!  Later some dude has his face squeezed off (the only real latex effort in special effects), a chick's hand gets blended into a protein shake while it's still attached to her and there's a random zombie fish attack...yes, one zombie in the entire movie and it's a fish.  This movie is the ultimate in random stupidity and ill-execution.  It even includes death by tanning bed--which may be the first time this ever happened on film (?), later copied by the I Know What You Did Last Summer and Final Destination franchises.

After reaching the limits of his tolerance of all these unexplainable events, Michael  hires a paranormal investigator.  He's a psychometrist (I had to look it up, too).  His character, obviously intended to be interesting, is at the very least as poorly written as the other aspects of this flick.  He's a boring stereotype and his little value beyond his WTF LOL death scene.

Shower scenes and wet bodies abound in this extra cheesy kill flick in which a HAL-like gym security system takes it upon itself to kill its members like they kill their triceps.  Yup, basically an evil security camera possessed by Michael's dead wife starts killing people.  However, her real revenge is that the actor who plays her still living lover Michael would never have a better role than he did in this movie.  Why is she doing this?  Essentially, she's lonely in Hell after killing herself.  So, to get his attention, she possesses the body of her super-creepy twin brother and starts killing everyone at Michael's gym and she won't stop unless he kills himself to keep her company.

The gore is laughable and received hardly any effort even for its time with the exception of the occasional melted face.  Meanwhile random blood spritzes and the melted corpses do little to stimulate anything more than an eye-rolling grin.

I'm not gonna' lie.  I've seen better...LMAO. This movie starts and then goes nowhere as it sadly misses the potential of each butchered kill scene one by one.  But it was fun to watch.",1372032000,2,3729,4.8420221169036335
776688,4,6304044194,"DEATH SPA is one of those timeless lame silly early 80s , kinda slasher films. I love this and anyone into the genra will as well. Its about well...hmm...the plot is so silly i don't want to spoil it for you its a great fun silly 80s flick complete with the bad music the horrid 80s fashion horrible acting bogus efects and a polt that only lovers of ""Sleepover camp"" will like,""there a hint.
If you like fun silly cheesy and 80s this is for you its fun to watch as a collector of weird 80s horror on vhs it is right up there with Fatal Games as one of my favs.",1308182400,2,561,4.017857142857143
776689,5,6304044194,"There ia absolutely nothing like this movie!!! Yes it is a bit corny, but it is very funny and has an excellent plot. (How many movies do you remembre where a jealous, deceased ex wife comes back to haunt and torment any AND everybody at a health spa, through a computer system no less?) If you are into 1980's horror with laughs and a little bit of nudity, then check this one out. Otherwise, this isn't for you.",1093737600,19,413,4.3076923076923075
776690,5,6304044194,"Not as much gore as advertised but still a decent movie. It moves kind of slow but the story and what gore there was was great. I mostly give credit to the fact that this movie was made in the eighties and was based on the fact that a computer system ran a health spa. Not many movies revolved around computers at that time so you have to give Death Spa it's props because if it wasn't a great movie, it was at least ahead of it's time!",1093305600,5,436,3.965909090909091
7860974,4,6304044194,Its not a good movie but worth watching if you're into cheesy 80s horror. Some ridiculous yet satisfying special effects. The finale is rather good.,1524960000,,148,4.96

7860976,1,6304044194,holy crap this was bad.  no plot 45 min in.  I couldve been stoned and this would be crap,1519516800,,89,3.6315789473684212
7860977,2,6304044194,Some will like it but it's not my cup of tea.  Does anyone remember those 1990's health-club commercials with that skinny pop star what's her name?,1518307200,,147,4.653846153846154
7860978,4,6304044194,A so bad it's good for its era horror movie. I liked that it didn't pull punches when it came to the more gruesome moments.,1518048000,,123,3.96
7860979,2,6304044194,"I gave this 2 stars only because it brought back pleasant memories of such an embarrassing, awful and wonderful time. I was in college in the 80's and this terrible movie jettisoned me back to parachute pants, feathered hair and pining over girls wearing leg warmers. Egads.

This movie couldn't be any more typical of the 80's. This is like Jamie Lee Curtis' Perfect meets Slumber Party Massacre or something. It's the very epitome of, ""It's so bad it's good.""

Well, not good but maybe entertaining for a laugh if you were a teenager during the 80's.",1515888000,,552,4.680412371134021

7860983,5,6304044194,"This movie is part 80s B slasher and part artistic and creative genius. It's a masterpiece of opposing forces. If you're a fan of movies like ""Chopping Mall"" and ""Slumber Party Massacre,"" you'll undoubtedly love this forgotten midnight film.",1513814400,,241,5.205128205128205
