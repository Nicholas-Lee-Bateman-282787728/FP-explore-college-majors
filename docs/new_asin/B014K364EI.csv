8731042,4,B014K364EI,"Scorpion Releasing has found a rarely viewed Euro title, Director Paolo Cavara's 'THE WILD EYE' aka 'L'OCCHIO SELVAGGIO' - 1968 and presently with our senses constantly bombarded by Reality TV, viewers can finally appreciate it.  Director Cavara was a collaborator with Documentarian and sensationalist, Gualtiero Jacopetti who unleashed 'MONDO CANE' aka 'A DOG'S LIFE'-1962 on the world and the Mondo film cycle was born.  People swarmed the movie houses at that time preparing to be shocked by supposedly real (but staged) oddities and sequel upon sequel were cranked out at rapid paces until audiences grew tired of them.  The Mondo form would reappear in the early eighties with 'THE FACES OF DEATH' franchise.  ""THE WILD EYE' is Cavara's sarcastic take on making these types of films and the risks that the filmmakers experience in lensing brutal realism continued to this day.  Actor Philippe Leroy is excellent as the maniacal director who will stop at nothing to film the most shocking events found using his crew and subjects as expendable objects.  Cult Euro star Gabriele Tinti is the cameraman and Delia Boccardo in her screen debut, plays the innocent lured into the maniacal maelstrom.  With beautiful photography by Marcello Masciocchi and a stellar lounge music score by Gianni Marchetti, the film emerges as a harrowing statement on Reality film making. Beware, this film is not for everyone and contains some strong sequences .  Scorpion releases this DVD in a sharp 2.35 English dubbed  transfer with nary a scratch on the negative making it look like it was made yesterday.  Extras include an original trailer for the American release and an 18 minute interview with actor Lars Bloch who plays Ms Boccardo's cuckold husband in the film and has great memories of the shoot.  Recommended for film students and Euro Cult enthusiasts.",1460419200,2,1850,5.133333333333334
