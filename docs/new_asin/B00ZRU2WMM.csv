8720796,5,B00ZRU2WMM,"This is a great film and should be of interest to any true Fellini fan. Fellini has been quoted as saying Satyricon as well as Casanova were his most ""realized films"". I love his over the top films where the absurd reigns. Not to say LSD was the cause of his move toward more surrealist stuff but uhghh ok yeaa it was. His films after Juliet of the spirits were very psychedelic. Sutherland gives a career peak performance. I love 81/2 and Nights of etc..but what i consider Fellini's psychedelic period just seems to me to be from another dimension. The bizarre soundtrack just makes the visuals work even better. I love the strange characters and costumes. This is slower paced than Satyricon but seems to be a companion in relation to the style of the absurd used so strongly. I feel these 2 filMS are so far from commercial it's incredible. Remember 81/2 as well as la dolce vita relied heavily on commentary about the external world from a dreamlike state were as Satyricon and Casanova basically take place from start to finish in a dream world or another felliniesque dimension.

I was very happy to see this region B disk work on my dvd player. I thank the reviewer that cleared this up or else i would of not taken the gamble.",1513382400,2,1235,4.513392857142857

8720798,4,B00ZRU2WMM,"Great quality, but some scenes of the movie were deleted.
This Fellini's extravaganza deserves to be seen in uncut edition and with some extras.
Thanks.",1463011200,,152,5.12
8720799,5,B00ZRU2WMM,"I was nervous about ordering this Blu-ray because it's in region B/2 and I didn't think it would work on my A/1 player.  But, thanks to another review that said it would play on a region A/1 player, I ordered it.  Oh joy, oh rapture, it plays perfectly!  The video and audio are beautiful!  It has both the English language and Italian language audio, and it has English subtitles.  What a bargain at the Amazon price",1460332800,2,417,4.434210526315789
8720800,5,B00ZRU2WMM,"This is in all honesty, the absolute most spectacular version of this  this film has ever looked on home video. If you're interested in it I can't recommend it enough.

I've had two DVD copies of this film and both were incredibly frustrating - one not having an option for Donald Sutherland's voice on it, and the other matted on the screen into a tiny box.

I understand the film was dubbed in post production, but I feel you miss something important when the voice coming out of Casanova's mouth is someone other than Donald. What is more, since this Mr. Bongo bluray has the english dub on it, I can focus on these images and sounds, which in my opinion are easily some of Fellini's greatest. This film is just as important as say, Amarcord. I've read a few places that the maestro considered it his best, and I can certainly see why.

It worked on my bluray player (region A). It was a gamble, but with the previous versions I almost felt as though I hadn't seen the films really yet (same goes to the NA release of City of Women - atrocious!).",1456790400,7,1049,4.364102564102564
8720801,5,B00ZRU2WMM,"I love the film, one of Fellini's more sadly underrated works, a ruthless dissection of masculine stupidity in the person of Giacomo Casanova, the absolute embodiment of the Man Who Doesn't Get It.

The Mr. Bongo Blu-Ray, nicely region-free and nicely mastered, has an unfortunately incomplete set of English subtitles for the Italian soundtrack --  all spoken words during the great Venice/Venus Festival at film's start are untranslated, and Casanova's first spoken words are left in Italian, and there are lots of typos in what subtitles there are.

Worth rolling with, I guess.  But the film deserves a really first-rate release.  This is closer than we've gotten so far....",1442275200,8,678,5.18348623853211
