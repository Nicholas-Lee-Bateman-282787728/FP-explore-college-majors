8191549,5,B000PHX8VQ,"Father Walter Ciszek is up for sainthood and according to an EWTN documentary about him, may be the reason that Vlad Putin is an Orthodox Christian now and that Russia is allowed freedom of religion and is in a period of great religious revival. Father Ciszek spent 20 years in Russian prisons and work camps, and this is his life story. I hope, if I ever have to suffer for my faith, that I am as brave and joyous in meeting it as he was. Walter, pray for us.",1476316800,2,460,4.179775280898877

8191551,4,B000PHX8VQ,"This 30-minute documentary tells the true story of Father Walter Ciszek SJ, an American Jesuit priest who vanished into the Soviet Union via Poland on a secret mission of evangelization during the early stages of WWII in 1939, only to be swiftly arrested by the KGB and ultimately presumed dead in the United States (his Jesuit brothers had offered the customary three masses for his soul) before finally being rediscovered in a Siberian camp. After verifying that the letters coming from Siberia to Ciszek's family in Pennsylvania were real, President Kennedy's state department had Ciszek freed in a prisoner exchange in the early 1960s. Upon reaching home, Ciszek dictated his survival experiences (including Moscow's dreaded Lubianka prison) and underground ministry in two books co-authored with Chicago Jesuit Father Dan Flaherty, ""With God in Russia"" (telling the externals of his odyssey) and the more spiritually-based ""He Leadeth Me."" Ciszek, who died in the early 1980s, spent the rest of his life as a legend in the American Catholic Church. This film recalls the barest details of his ministry and imprisonment, relying entirely upon on-camera interviews with Fr. Flaherty for the details, and additionally offers some fascinating footage and interviews about the state of Catholicism (many Catholics in Russia today are of Polish or Lithuanian descent, despite a small number of Eastern Rite Catholics) and freedom of worship in the Russian Republic today. This film gets the job done, but feels long even at 30 minutes, and the black-and-white static photography overlaid with Fr. Flaherty's voice is a somewhat lazy way to go about making a documentary on the life of such a figure. Rather than seeking out interviews with surviving family members and Jesuits who knew Ciszek, we are treated to Father Flaherty (who admittedly is the last living expert on Ciszek, having researched his life and worked with him intimately on the books back in the 1960s) narrating everything until we get to the modern-day stuff on Russian Catholicism. But this video is still very good, giving you all the basics without rehashing the books, and is the only film to my knowledge that has been made on Ciszek. It may spark interest in reading the books (which are gripping pager-turners) among those who don't know the story. I highly recommend the DVD if you want a brief overview of his life and the status of Catholicism in Russia today.",1388275200,6,2439,5.1
8191552,1,B000PHX8VQ,"Utter disappointment!!!  The producers and distributors of this video ought to be ashamed of themselves!!  The two books co-written by Father Ciszek stand alone in their piety and holy messages.  This movie is a flagrant rip off of the hard work and suffering of the saintly priest.  The title should be stripped from this DVD and an apology should be issued to anyone who has been led to believe that they are buying anything close to the beautiful and inspired work of Father Ciszek.  Shame on you, Ignatius Press.  Shame on you!",1253577600,25,531,4.717391304347826
