8509576,5,B007425SZ4,"This is really an excellent instructional video. However, at this time it can only be purchased through the Yang Family web site (yangfamilytaichi) Very high quality production, very detailed instruction on body placements as Yang Jun guides you through the movements. Also, his verbal instructions in a separate section of the DVD show different aspects of how and why the basic movements are done, their relationship to Tai Chi Chuan, and yin and yang theory. He also shows how the movements are used in martial arts, since at its core, Tai Chi Chuan is a martial art first. It is clear Yang Jun has taught many students and knows what things need to be pointed out for better understanding. This is about as good as it gets from DVD instruction on something that really needs to be taught in person. However, for someone like me, who lives about 700 miles from the Yang Tai Chi Chuan center, I'll have to make do with this for now.
A couple of things that may be difficult for some. The DVD is in English, but Yang Jun's English is not perfect. If you have difficulty listening to a foreign speaker, in this case Chinese, this may be a small issue. Pay attention.
Yang Jun is a direct 6th generation lineage holder of the Yang style in the Yang family from Yang Lu Chan. This is important, and for me worth the price of this DVD.
Another very high quality Tai Chi Chuan DVD is ""Yang Tai Chi for Beginners"" by Yang Jwing Ming, which is available through Amazon. I've compared the movements of both of these now and they are the same, with some very small variations in the later, probably due to its lineage going through Taiwan. (Just a guess, as I don't really know.) Yang Jwing Ming is also and excellent teacher who has put a huge amount of work into passing Chinese Daoist and martial arts on to the rest of the world.",1433721600,3,1825,4.483483483483483
8509577,3,B007425SZ4,I wanted to see what the long form consisted of and that was what I got. Presented by a  direct linage family member. It should be close to the original.,1380758400,,153,4.1
8509578,5,B007425SZ4,"I have studied tai chi from books, VCR tapes, DVD tapes and have belt certification from a Chinese Wushu instructor and although this isn't equivalent to teaching from a professional teacher in a studio, it is the best I have seen on VCR, DVD's and books. I highly recommend this DVD video.",1372809600,,290,4.596153846153846
