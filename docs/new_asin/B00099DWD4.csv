He would tape them and send them to me here in NY but invariably he would miss a few episodes. I finally decided to break down and buy all 5 seasons because I just LOVE THIS SHOW!! Ricky, Julian and especially Bubbles are hilarious, and while the profanity is excessive, it fits right in with the characters. This has got to be about the most original thing that's ever been on TV. You'll laugh till you cry or pee your pants - you won't regret buying this!",1166313600,,549,4.140186915887851

I think that's what makes this series so great. Everyone everywhere should see this.",1124409600,,259,5.046511627906977

I'm gonna wait for Netflix to ship ALL the episodes to me, maybe, in the NEAR future!!!  I sure hope so...

Ricky & Julian: nonstop comedy!!!",1121299200,,314,4.777777777777778
8058512,5,B00099DWD4,"The first four seasons on seven dvd's will make you want to get drunk and eat chicken fingers.  Stop playing hash hockey and buy this.  Sunnyvale Trailer Park is what's happening, people. We got Julian, Ricky, Bubbles, J-Roc and the Rockpile, those axxholes Trevor and Cory, that drunk bastard Lahey, and there's always dope, alcohol and firearms.  Watch Ricky quit smoking with his daughter, Cyrus being a dxck, Randy being a no shirt wearing, 15 cheeseburger  eating mxhfxcka, Cory and Trevor getting arrested, Ricky getting shot, and the Green Bastard. I have no negative comments.",1120435200,4,584,5.11578947368421
8058513,5,B00099DWD4,"Trailer Park Boys has got to be the most original thing to ever be shown on TV. The story follows a main plot throughout the seasons, and is best watched in chronological order, but has enough substance in each episode to be watched individually. The characters are portrayed extremely well, making them believable and allowing the viewer to connect with them in a way which is all but impossible with any other show, while not being overdone or unrealistic as is the case with most television. The combination of realism and the absurd is very well done, making the episodes easy to watch over and over again without getting old.

The show is set in Nova Scotia, and while the Canadian influence is subtle enough that it could happen almost anywhere, many elements of the show are distictly Canadian and add a charm to it that does not exist in anything from the US.

Although most episodes have more profanity than an NWA album, it is essential to the realism of the characters and is no different than an ordinary conversation that might be heard on any corner. The show is an awesome example of how a show can be

entertaining and edgy without relying on naked girls walking around to keep the viewer's attention.

The show is a bit rough around the edges, mainly because so much of it was filmed with handheld cameras, and mainstream TV watchers might overlook it because of this, but after a few episodes it wouldnt look right any other way.

There is no reason not to buy this. It will be money well spent and a DVD that will stand out in any collection.",1119916800,6,1561,4.540925266903915
