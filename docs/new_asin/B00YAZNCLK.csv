This movie ""The Bigfoot Diaries""  was stupid and so immature and a real let down.  The people do not know how to act !!  The movies that were made in the 70""s are by far so much better and scary.  I can't believe the crappy movies they make nowadays !",1479686400,,405,3.9875
8717960,1,B00YAZNCLK,"Don't waste your money. I tossed this DVD in the trash. Now at the city dump! This movie was made just to take money from people who like Big Foot movies. I have watched them all but this one is below the bottom of the trash can. If you are a true Big Foot, Sasquatch fan then trust me when I tell you to please save your money.",1478217600,,328,3.838235294117647

8717962,4,B00YAZNCLK,"I had no real expectations for this and was pleasantly surprised. An older gentleman wants to track & study bigfoot and assembles his crew. He has a scientist (a cute female and the cameraman keep focusing on her rear), the cameraman, hunter/tracker and the older gentleman's drunk nephew. They interview locals (the acting range is wide among them, bad to good) and there's some funny recreations of sightings. The script even has foreshadowing.

I liked this as the movie moves at a brisk pace and doesn't bore. It also never takes itself seriously. This is key when you don't have a huge budget for a costume. The DVD looked great on my big TV. The DVD itself is rather barebones (feature, outtakes, trailer) But that's alright. A welcome addition to your collection.",1454284800,,770,4.833333333333333
