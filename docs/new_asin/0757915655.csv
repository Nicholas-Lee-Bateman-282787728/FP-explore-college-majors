3249,5,0757915655,"This book plus the dvd is a must to the beginning double bassist. I haven't found much on the subjet and when I came across this book and dvd I was totally mesmerized. Excersizes r great the way its set up is really cool. A very inspiring methode. Rufus Reid is very clear in what he says and teaches.

If you think its expensive well its worth the investment.",1156032000,4,360,4.217391304347826
3250,5,0757915655,"I had owned this book for a while and only recently discovered this video existed. Reid is a master jazz bassist and the material of this sort is rare so I ordered it. I was not disappointed. This DVD is really priceless, having a master sit and give you a couple hours of personal tips and demonstration is something that even if you could get it (and as a beginner it would be nigh impossible), it would cost 10x or more.

This isn't quite an 'absolute beginners' lesson, you will need another video to give you tips on setup of a new bass and that kind of thing. This is the kind of video that you can watch over and over and keep learning new things, or just gaining renewed inspiration.

So, if you are a double bassist, or even an electric player interested in the acoustic, and you could benefit from some

lessons from a world class player, then buy this, you won't be disappointed.",1135123200,40,890,4.349397590361446
3251,5,0757915655,"I came to bass playing in my late 30s after a lifetime of playing mainly guitar, banjo and mandolin, and I went through a lot of books looking for a clear and solid foundation for upright jazz playing.
Of all the methods out there, Reid's is the one that has really stood the test of time, and for good reason. He starts the reader off with basic scales and simple patterns for playing over changes. From there it's on through more complex scales and  patterns and finally, soloing, illustrated with a number of transcribed classics.
Combine this book with the Simandl book for basic technique (and a good library of jazz albums), and you have just about everything needed to guide the beginning bass player through the intermediate stage. For a player who already had a basic classical technique, this book alone is just about all that's needed to learn to play jazz.",1024272000,21,868,4.673202614379085
3252,5,0757915655,"""The Evolving Bassist"" has come to be the standard bass method book in the world of jazz.  In it, Rufus Reid explains his ""concept"" of playing bass, moving beyond merely playing quarter notes to progressive and thoughtful bass lines.
As the title of the book indicates, this is a process.  The book is designed for players of any level to develop a well-rounded approach to the bass.
The main portion of the method includes etudes, scales, and standard patterns for Latin bass lines, Rock bass lines, etc.  Also included are many practical hints, answers to frequently asked questions, discography, and transcriptions of a number of Mr. Reid's compositions.
""The Evolving Bassist"" is all around an excellent aid for the growing jazz bass player.",986947200,35,745,5.040650406504065
3253,5,0757915655,"Mr. Reid covers everything!!!  Gear, instruments, amps, cables... then how to play the thing!  Electric or Double bass.  Amazing photos of Rufus demonstrating how to get your bass on a plane... How to position hands/fingers on Double Bass, Electric and the Bass VI.  The only book I know of that addresses the Fender Bass VI and explores its potential as a means to expanding soloing possibilities for any bassist with Bass VI specific excercises.",1426723200,,447,5.0

3255,5,0757915655,"Rufus Reid is a Master of the genre (Jazz) and his instrument(Double Bass)! I always learn from Rufus when he speaks and I, in turn, pass the knowledge onto my private bass students! Thank, Mr. Rufus Reid...much Respect! I highly recommend others to purchase this DVD!",1425772800,,268,4.8478260869565215
3256,3,0757915655,"Reid is a great philosopher and entertainer, and the concert  part of the DVD is awesome. He doesn't teach a lot, though.",1410480000,,121,4.5
3257,5,0757915655,"I love this DVD! Rufus not only breaks it down, but shows it in the trio setting how it works. If you're a beginner, this really isn't for you, but still you can learn the theory side from. For the beginner, I recommend Todd Phillips DVD 1 & 2, and workout. Get those along with this DVD, you'll be working for days.",1393372800,,316,4.112903225806452
3258,5,0757915655,Excellent teaching tool to go along with Rufus Reid's book. I found just watching it as a video without even having my hands on my bass was wonderful. Each time one watches you pick up more and more information. The trio performances are fanastic.,1389052800,,247,4.636363636363637
3259,5,0757915655,Great book for beginners and for those who want to learn how to play bass very quickly. Excellent presentation. Thanks!,1381708800,,119,5.0
3260,5,0757915655,The evolving Bassist is a great source of technique essentials.  I was put onto it by my tutor and it has been a huge help.,1373932800,,123,3.92
3261,5,0757915655,"I had this book for several years and misplaced it  and purchased it a gain. This is the standard to get a student playing all over the acoustic bass. All bass students should have this book in their library.

3262,5,0757915655,"I recommend you get a handful of lessons and some background before you get into this book. There are some questions you might have that could be tough to answer without the benefit of a teacher.

Having said that, this is a great book. It really starts with complete beginner basics, and builds from there. You're playing will grow with each section. You'll get out of it what you put into it with this book - which can be a ton.

Whether you apsire to play jazz or not, this book can open you up as a bassist and give you many tools to use.",1357084800,,542,4.152380952380953
3263,4,0757915655,"This book offers a lot of good knowledge for bassplayers especially for the double bass players. My favorities are open string and walkin' bass excersises. I am a bass teacher and I use this book a lot in my lessons. The new millenium edition (2000) has better fonts and notations than older editions. So it is much easier to play those lessons.  There are some things I would have wanted, for example how to play scales in one and two octaves. But there are lots of books that show the scales and chords etc. I fully recommend this book for all bass players and teachers in all levels.",1348531200,2,586,4.425925925925926
3264,4,0757915655,"This is a great book to be played, not read! Following the book will result in a more thorough understanding of the bass fingerboard as it applies to the harmonic foundation of bass playing.",1296432000,,190,4.617647058823529
3265,5,0757915655,"When I was in high school in the 1980s, I studied bass. Not that I could play it. I have Cerebral Palsy. For our purposes, my mind could do the walking. My fingers could not.

But The Evolving Bassist was one of the main texts my teacher used. Buy this, and it will keep you busy for a very long time, whether you study double or electric bass.

Rufus Reid is a jazz bass player, and this book teaches you through jazz. It goes from the most basic whole, half, quataer, eighth and sixteenth note exercises, and slowly shows you how to build walking lines. These increase in complication, and if you hit the end of this book, no easy task, you will be at least a good jazz player, ready to play whatever type of music you want.

I never did get there- I and my spastic little ten appendages  went to university and learned two more instruments--a typewriter and, later, a computer. You judge the results.

I did, however, get to both see and meet Reid: he taught at what was then William Paterson College-now university, and used to play there on Sunday afternoons. Twenty minutes from where I grew up.  He also has at least one good album out,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rufus-Reid-Trio-Perpetual-Stroll-LP-Vinyl/dp/B0019BI5OC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rufus Reid Trio: Perpetual Stroll [ LP Vinyl </a>]",1282953600,2,1352,5.040358744394619

3267,5,0757915655,"Learning to improve my jazz playing (being a mainly classical player) is made easier by this book, Reed was a brilliant bass methodologist and there is a lot to learn in this book.",1241222400,2,180,4.484848484848484
3268,5,0757915655,"This is a great book for any jazz instrumentalist who plays in concert pitch.  Because of the many etudes written in quarter notes, it'd probably even be a good way to practice transposing on the fly.  It's ideal for understanding bass lines, reading in bass clef, and absorbing underlying jazz solo ideas and structures.  According to my practice diary, I started studying from it about ten months ago.  My playing has improved and changed since using this book, and I don't even play the bass (I've been playing jazz guitar for 20+ years).  It's helped me outline chords better, think in a lower register, and think about function while playing--like use of passing tones in jazz, etc.  Reid's encouraging remarks, scattered throughout the book, are a warm, personal touch, which I think would be very good for a young musician to read.  I admire Rufus Reid as a player, and think he did a real service to jazz musicians when he wrote this book.  THIS WOULD MAKE A GREAT GIFT FOR ANY JAZZ MUSICIAN!",1229126400,3,1000,4.706896551724138
3269,5,0757915655,"Rufus Reid has an easy going, but very knowledgeable way of getting across music concepts. He doesn't rush things and he is very systematic in his explanations.  I enjoy listening to what he has to say about music and  ""stand up"" bass playing in particular.  I am a teacher (but not a music teacher), and I am also a learner. This guy knows his stuff! Rufus Rules!",1210118400,10,364,4.402985074626866
3270,4,0757915655,"I think this is a good book for those already able to find their way around a bass fingerboard. This book has lots to offer for those interested in improving their jazz technique. However, I needed to take lessons in order to learn correct fingerings/positions before getting into this book.",1205712000,6,291,4.84
3271,5,0757915655,"Rufus Reid's revised edition of the classic ""Evolving Bassist"" is a literal tour de force and a must have for all bass players regardless of what level of proficiency they play at.  The companion DVD (available separately and highly recommended) is a gem in which Rufus jams with two of the finest contemporary musicians illustrating various aspects of the text.  The DVD is worth the price just as a performance video.

While loosely defined as a method, the ""Evolving Bassist"" is really more of a well thought out approach to playing the instrument.  The skills taught follow several threads of theory and practice, but it's not a beginner tutorial even though very early players will benefit from the material...and continue to benefit throughout their playing career.  If one is desirous of a more basic text in the jazz genre then you must get ""The Michael Moore Bass Method"", probably the best tutorial currently available; the classical  ""Simandl"" material notwithstanding.  The two books and the ""Evolving..."" DVD really are complimentary and easily stand at the forefront of a limited field.  Highly recommended.",1177459200,16,1121,5.154696132596685
3272,5,0757915655,"I first bought this book in 1979 and have been using a version of it since then with my bass students. This new edition is very good and the DVD isa great asset. Rufus is an understanding teacher and if you get a chance to attend one of his master classes, don't pass them up.",1176249600,,276,4.036363636363636
7788377,5,0757915655,"A lot of people would argue that some of the Jamie Aebersold books are the essential jazz books, I would argue that for a bass player they aren't. A bass player's ability to improvise is necessary and the ability to solo is still important, but 99% of the time as a bass player you're going to be improvising bass lines, so why isn't analyzing bass lines focused on as much as soloing (at least in my experience in academia). This book will walk you through the history of bass lines, exercises, and other important material that every bass player needs to have down. No matter your level of bass playing, you will get important information out of this ranging from the basics of bass line construction to leaving space and showing some serious taste.",1523491200,,751,4.611940298507463
