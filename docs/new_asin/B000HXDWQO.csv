8142093,1,B000HXDWQO,"Branded begins by showing a man named Mitch coming home from somewhere.  He meets someone named Sergeant Larry outside.  He asks Larry what he's doing here, and Larry asks if he remembers a family who gave him a dog.  Just then a man pulls up listening to loud music.  He's a band member of this guy.  A drummer.  He asks who that Larry guy was.  Mitch says ""Some guy looking for his dog"".

After this the drummer shows up with a woman.  He and Mitch get into an argument.  The drummer says ""You forget who put us on top"" and Mitch says ""You forget you're the second choice as drummer"".  Mitch asks the lady what she thinks of the drummer and she says ""It's what he thinks about me"".  Mitch has a flashback of a little girl when the drummer asks if he wants to watch while the drummer makes out with his girlfriend.

While making out with the woman the drummer gets offended when she brings up his son.  He says ""Never bring up my son!"" and ""Have you ever heard of asfixia?""  He takes a spoon to the woman while she's hanging on the wall and eventually kills her in the worst death you've ever seen in a horror film.  He takes a spoon, holds it over a candle and burns her breast.  The drummer dumps her body in a lake when suddenly a man up ahead gets closer.

Mitch rehearses with his band members and wonders where the drummer is.  Mitch says his blackouts and weird dreams from high school have returned.  The drummer comes in and the other band member says he looks like crap.  The drummer says it's because he's just been crucified.  Later that night Mitch has a weird dream about a little girl playing with a toy and another girl sitting in a bathtub covered in blood.  The little girl swings her toy while holding a candle.  He's then woken up by his band member.

The drummer gets into an argument with another band member.  He says Mitch is setting them up with his own solo career and is secretly working against them  The drummer takes off outside.  One band members questions why Mitch suddenly wants to start writing his own music.  The band member says ""I hoe we don't end up a one hit wonder"".

The drummer visits a clothing store and asks the store worker to join him for the day.  Two hot women also come along for the ride.  When the drummer leaves the store the worker says ""You forgot your pen!"" but the drummer replies ""You can have it back after we sign your CD's"".  Mitch is now jogging down the road.  Larry, the man who lost his dog appears.  He says he still can't find his dog.

The drummer and the two girls from the store hang out together outside.  The one girl gets an attitude and wants to leave but her hot blonde friend tells her to chill out for once.  The drummer gives her drugs which makes her throw up.  The blonde girl walks her home.  She screams and suddenly both girls are chained to a wheel inside a barn.  A man says ""I want to show you how deep the rabbit hole goes!""  The man places a spoon over a candle and places the candle on the blonde girl's boobs.  He's going to use this same burning technique again?  Wow how lame.  It didn't make sense the first time!  Her female friend screams.  Meanwhile Mitch has another dream in the shower that a little girl is pouring blood on the ground.

The one band member wants to know when the drummer is going to take his role in the band seriously.  He says, not so politely, that he's been working on getting females since he got here!  We see the band reciting like typical cheesy rock stars.  Mitch and that store employee talk about having a male bondage (no not that kind!) and make a bet over something.  Mitch and this store employee go for a jog when the store employee sees a dead woman in the lake.  He runs after her, picks up her body but Mitch runs away.

The store worker is actually a cop and secretly uses his walkie talkie to contact his fellow cop friends.  He says he needs to talk to the band members back at home.  He questions Mitch's actions and why he suspiciously ran away back there, implying he's responsible for the girl's death.  Mitch calls someone named Meg about the encounter he had with a cop and the dead woman that was found.  Meg says ""It'll be okay- I'll take care of it"".  Just then the cop appears and asks if he was talking to his lawyer on the phone.  Mitch defends himself and says he doesn't know the dead woman but the cop thinks he does.

We see the two women hanging on a wheel on the wall.  The band members tell the guy who lost his dog (Larry) to keep his eyes open.  He says he already saw the killer and looked him in the eye.  Larry says the enemy has deverted the band members attention.  The band members get offended and tell him to get off their property.  He says wars aren't started by planes dropping bomb- wars are started by words.  He says none of the band members are worthy of being soldiers.  It takes heart.

Meanwhile the dog stumbles into the room with the two girls hanging on a wall as Mitch has more flashbacks of the little girl.  The killer gives the one girl something to drink.  She says she doesn't want to die like this.  Her mouth is then covered in duck tape as the killer places another hot spoon over her breasts.  The killer says ""Three little monkeys are on a bed- one fell off and now she's dead!""

Mitch goes for a ride and picks up Meg at the airport.  He says this has been the worst day of his life.  Meg comes back to his house and tells the band members she's going to drown someone.  Given the death of the girl at the lake the one band member says ""Bad choice of words!""  Meg smacks the drummer in the face.  She says to the drummer he's the one who got them in this mess in the first place.

Meg asks the drummer if he had sex or gave drugs to the girl who's dead.  Meg says the band members are nothing without her and that it took years to bring the band members together and she'll be darned if she lets them break it apart in one day.  Meg mentions the lack of success by the band members songs on the charts.  We now see the band performing somewhere.  This song they're playing sounds decent.  They sound like a Scorpions wannabe band.

A man in the recording studio fiddles with the buttons as we hear a woman's voice say ""I'm  scared"".  The killer walks into the barn where the two women are tied to a wall and does something.  The next day the one band member says he needs to talk when confronting Meg.  She says she's handling this while the band member throws jelly on his toast.

The one band member tells Meg that Mitch's bad dreams are getting worse.  She says she doesn't know about these dreams he's been having.  Meg says she knows she's hard on the band but they have to trust that she knows what she's doing.  In the bathroom Mitch touches Meg's breast scar, indicating she two had a hot candle spoon placed on her breast.

Meg confronts the guy who lost his dog but he tells her to get off his property.  The drummer lays on the floor, shakes around and laughs.  The other band members say ""At least you're entertaining!""  In the room with the two girls hanging on the wall, a man is lying on the floor beside the one girl.  The killer slices him up with a knife but it's done in a way we can't really see it since the camera jumps around.

Outside Mitch sees a black dog running around and hallucinates that a man is handing him ice cream.  The cop guy stumbles into the room with the two women hanging on a wall.  They're both dead and he radios in a homicide has occurred here.  The band members say they're on every news station and crap is starting to hit the fan.  The band members are now interviewed by the news reporters.  Meg says for now on they have to come to her before they talk to anyone else.

Meg wakes up one of the band members and says there's something he needs to know.  They come downstairs and Meg makes him a glass of wine.  She says she's supposed to hold the band together but she's starting to fall apart.  Meg poisoned the band members drink and carries him back to his room.  She drops her dress, revealing her spoon scars and walks up to him.

The band member is now found dead in his bathtub.  Mitch has a flashback that a little kid walks into the bathroom and sees his mommy in the bathtub dead.  We see a man taking off a belt and a little girl carrying her brother down the road and to the woods.  The little girl tells the boy that his mommy is okay.  When he cries for the girl not to leave him she smiles and says ""Fly away!""

The little boy was Mitch!  And Meg was the girl!  The cops come by and arrest Mitch.  The little girl from his hallucinations is outside behind the yellow tape.  She says ""Fly away Mitch, fly away!"" like in his dream.  She doesn't put any effort into her ""Fly away"" line which is hilarious.  3 months later.  Meg apologizes for not protecting Mitch.  She thanks him for the fall so she can have all this fame and power being associated with his band.  She calls Mitch a sucker and says the other band members are too messed up to understand what was going on.  I don't do drugs and I can't understand it myself!

Just then the drummer comes into Meg's office room and places something over her mouth that makes her foam.  He sarcastically thanks her for the platinum and mentions Mitch, the other band member in jail and two little girls pleading on their song.  But this is all a secret that only the drummer and Meg can keep.  He places a drug needle in her hand and says she's replaceable.

""Coop helped clear Mitch on all murder accounts.  9 months after his sister's apparent overdose, Mitch was released from prison"".

Mitch visits a graveyard and the little girl appears.  She hands him her teddy bear.  She kisses him but doesn't say ""Fly away Mitch!"" like I thought she would.  He says ""Why Meg why!"" and walks away.  I almost hate the song playing here but it has a pretty good chorus so nevermind.  The closing credits song is pretty good too.

This movie is really horrible.  It has extremely bad acting, a story that barely tells anything, no killings, no strong characters or anything at all going for it.  It's best to avoid it.",1502409600,,10115,4.25

8142096,1,B000HXDWQO,"Ok before I start bashing this film,
let me just list everything that was entertaining about this experience.
- The art on the cover of the DVD...................
That is all.

It's a movie about a corny rock band,
staying at a managers cabin, where murders start taking place.
That's it.
Nothing deeper or more profound.
The flashbacks into the lead singers past do little to enrich the already hopelessly mundane story.
And the uninspired story being the only grace that COULD have saved this flick, falls desperately flat.
The dialogue seemed like it sort of wanted to be witty, (I guess)
but when jokes are being delivered by meat-puppets,
no ones laughin'.

You ever watch a movie that felt more like a trial in self-masochism than entertainment?
You ever curse yourself for not turning a movie off?
Waiting forever for that one redeeming death scene that you know has to be coming.
The glorious scene that will make the unbearable wait worth the effort.
But before it ever arrives,
the credits roll.
And frustration burns it's way deep into your scalp?
Essentially;
If I were to put a handful of razors on my tongue,
duct-tape my mouth shut,
pour boiling water on my face,
and bite down, to ease the pain,
it would pretty much be the be equivalent of watching 20 minutes,
none the less, a feature length film of this mind-numbing, brutally-amateur, souless effort.
Amateur porn actually has better production values than this horror flick did.
I can't believe I had to type that.
The acting is sooooooooooo bad,
(the leading man is the worst actor I've seen, in my soon to be short life)
it actually takes you out of the film.
You are very aware that you are watching people ""try"" to ""act"".
And I use that term loosely.
This movie, if little else, has created a new term for me,
""Murphys Horror""
""Everything that could be wrong WAS wrong with this movie.""

Just a thought:
I've noticed,
The best low-budget horror movies, are the ones that are wildly over the top.
The ones that are acutely aware of their low-budget,
and instead of letting that be their limitation,
they use it to their advantage,
to instead focus on other aspects of a movie that are regularly absent from bigger budget horror flicks
(ie: Oh, I don't know.........Style, Soul).
Usually the best ones are horror-comedies, but that's not always the case.
They're usually unique in scope,
And now-a-days, more often than not, unique means wildy bizarre, or viciously hilarious.

MORAL OF THE STORY:
Have a suicide counselor on speed dial, if you actually bought flick.",1202688000,6,2540,4.779043280182233
