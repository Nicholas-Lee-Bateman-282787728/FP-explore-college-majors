It's not an easy movie, but the good ones never are. The main actor is incredible, it's really rare to see such a deep, bold and subtle performance. There's something sexy, obsessive and edgy about the main character that makes this movie one of the best European movies I've ever seen! I highly recommend this movie to any movie lover!",1331596800,2,500,4.629213483146067
8444435,2,B004W4UJ7Y,"A film about a boy who is in love with his twin sister. Intriguing storyline, but there's nothing great here. The main character is annoying, some of the scenes don't serve any purpose or even have any sense to them, the atmosphere is overly gloomy, and not enough happens to sustain it as a whole.",1330819200,,298,4.4363636363636365
