1689331,5,B000063BJ1,"Out of 5 stars I would give it a 10 (if I could) becuase this is my favorite movie. I was never into Hindi movies till I saw this one. Its beautifully acted written and directed. Karan Johar (the director and writer) makes movies that are so wonderful.  This movie makes you cry, makes you laugh and makes you really appreciate the qualty of a good film. The casting for this movie was perfect. Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol have some great chemistry as well as Hrithik Roshan and Kareena Kapoor and it woundt be the same without the astounding Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bhaduri.  The songs are what make this movie even better.  There all my favorite, I love listenening to them and I only speak English but the songs are just so enchanting to listen to, it was weird at first but it really grows on you.  I can never get tired of this movie. This isn't normally the type of Movie I watch, I never liked reading while watching a movie, but you get lost in the subtitles and it doesnt really matter, cause you feel like you can understand everything they say.
The Movie centers around the Raichand family and thier values. Yash (the dad, Amitbah) is a rich buisness man and has two sons, Raoul(Khan) and Rohan (Roshan).  Raoul strays from the values set by his father by marrying Anjali (Kajol) and splits the family up. Rohan throughout the movie tries to reunite His family again.
Summaries don't do this movie justice, you have to see it to truly enjoy it!!!!",1060473600,3,1457,4.462406015037594
1689345,5,B000063BJ1,A mother's Love and a concern always better and great then anything. A true love always sense you wherever you are. my all time favorite film. I am great fan of Karen. He made such a great emotional movie ever seen on any screen. I have seen this movie about 100 times.,1518912000,,269,4.1923076923076925
1689346,3,B000063BJ1,"Wow, this movie is an EMOTIONAL ROLLER COASTER. Some parts were happiness. Some parts were sorrow. Some parts were a little bit of both?? What an experience. I might have fallen asleep through a couple of the dance scenes but I don't think I missed much. (Except the wedding. Did they even get married? I missed it. Their son was cute though!) This is definitely a good movie to watch if you're super rich and feel like nobody understands how difficult your life is. Or if you like homoerotic subtext in scenes between brothers and fathers/sons.  It's also good if you're just in the mood for some good old fashioned crying scenes. Also good if you have four hours to waste: three and a half to watch the movie and then an extra half hour of crying.",1518912000,,749,4.467153284671533
1689347,4,B000063BJ1,"This is one of my favorite films. I gave it a four because of audio quality not because of context or storyline. Ive seen most ALL of Hrithik Roshans movies and own some in digital format of some type but wanted DVDs; unfortunately, disappointed with some of the audio fading in/out during some singing performances.  The movie is VERY worth watching and I shared with my granddaughters on the 4th viewing, my sisters on my 2nd viewing and Im sure I will watch it again.",1517011200,,470,4.529411764705882

And I know everything will all become digital in my lifetime and discs will be an obsolete thing of the past, but for the time being, I take comfort in the thought that even when my Wi-Fi goes down and my data has run out and my family is hogging the Netflix account, I can pop this in and switch over to my couch potato Alter Ego. The package came intact, shrink-wrapped and in a bubble mailer. Disc was scratch-free, and the display quality was impeccable.

1689393,4,B000063BJ1,"I am not Indian or anything, but I have known that Shah Rukh Khan is one of the big Bollywood stars. About 5 years ago, I saw My Name is Khan and while it wasn't perfect, I was moved enough by the performances of SRK and Kajol, but I really made no effort to brush up on anything else Bollywood. Well, I decided to watch Kal Ho Naa Ho a couple of weeks ago, and knew from then that I would watch just about anything with SRK in it. I would also leave my long-time relationship for him, too, but that's another story! So I decided to tackle this movie: fantastic looking cast, some great dance sequences, good story. I personally could have done with about 5 less musical sequences between Pooja and Rohan, however. And I may not agree with all of the life/family concepts and how they were presented and resolved in this movie, but I appreciate the intent.

I should also note that I had to watch the entire scene from when Rahul courted Anjali from the carnival all the way through to their musical sequence at the Egyptian pyramids about 4 times before I could finish the rest of the movie. Those scenes alone are worth the 3+ hours of this movie! And the scene when Rahul decides to marry Anjali and stands in the rain with his hand on her head while scenes of their marriage are interspersed? GOLD. I can't think of any other actors, American or otherwise, who burn up the screen more than Kajol and SRK.",1455494400,,1408,4.333333333333333

I laughed and cried (hard). It's a touching and beautiful movie. It is full of beautiful performances by an excellent cast that is also good to look at. The songs will have you dancing.

Couldn't get used to the whole dancing thing but I did end up watching it about 3 times.. entertaining! even some cringe drama scenes. If you are looking to check out Bollywood cinema, be sure to pick this up along with Laagan and 3 idiots. haha
I did pick up another Bollywood film with Sharuk Khan in it.. something about his character not being able to marry someone and some prostitute was involved.. lots and lots of man crying.. couldn't watch that one.

My only complaint is the second half of the film.  I did not like the romance between the younger brother and her younger sister.  I respect different cultures, but found it disconcerting to see a guy so clearly disdain a woman just because she wore Western clothes.  They also didn't seem to have any real chemistry--I know the actor playing the little brother is popular but I just didn't warm up to him.  On the other hand, the first couple [and more interesting one] really didn't care and I though they were more fun and down-to-earth.",1396569600,,766,4.428571428571429

As usual, Shahrukh Khan and Kajol, are magic together in this movie. I just love her! He really has a way of having chemistry with every leading lady he works with; that is a skill. The one musical number they did in the desert, OMG. It was HOT without being crude or nasty! I don't know how they did that! It was so sensual, sexy and smokin' but no kissing or inappropriate touching, that in itself is unique. It leaves you thinking without seeing people naked everywhere, something America needs to learn. I love how he was so devoted to his mother, and the one part in the movie where they were reunited, I cried my eyes out! It is a sad, beautiful and sweet movie and you really should see it! And of course, the usual music, dancing, etc, etc. Its amazing how they can fit all that in in these movies and still carry a serious storyline and it not seem weird.

1689512,5,B000063BJ1,"My introduction to Hindi cinema came through Netflix and I am hooked! The first film I ever saw was Jodhaa Akbar and obsession quickly took hold. Bollywood has a certain reputation that isn't entirely undeserved; however, it also has something that the vast majority of western films have been steadily losing for decades... true soul! Find a good Bollywood film (and it isn't as hard as the aforementioned reputation suggests) and you find something truly special. Kahbi Khushi Kahbie Gham is my first actual purchase and it truly is something special.

As far as production values go, it's first class all the way. Amazing locations, sets, cinematography, musical numbers, costumes, and even amazing cars! Visually the only issues that truly irk me are how the make-up artist was so heavy handed with Kareena Kapoor-Khan (she just married Bollywood mega-star Saif Ali Khan), but it suited the character. The other is overuse of the bloody wind machine indoors. Nobody's hair no matter how obscenely healthy blows like that inside!

The music is extremely good, especially in the second half because it didn't take me long to get a feel for the words and start singing along. The dancing is outstanding of course, and I loved how the choreography played to each actor's individual strengths. That way, everyone shines brightly. That's incredibly hard to do when you have other men dancing with Mr. Roshan.

Nevertheless, don't be fooled despite the lavishness of the settings and the glamorous world this story takes place in this is a very simple movie and like with anything simple, from boiling an egg to changing a light bulb, if you do it wrong it's a disaster. I say this as someone who's wrecked boiled eggs and screwed up changing light bulbs! Fortunately, I think that everyone involved with this movie knows that, and this movie succeeds because of it. Karan Johar's direction is outstanding, obviously, this was a passion project for him and it shows. However, even with that this movie hinges on one thing and really one thing only... the cast!

The cast is literally the ""who's who"" of Bollywood both when the movie was first released and now. You've got Mr. and Mrs. Bachchan, two living legends. Mr. Khan, who if not now will be a living legend in Indian cinema soon enough. Mr. Roshan, if he ever go attempts world domination will have nearly every living person on earth eating out of his hand. Kajol, (no prefixes just Kajol) who can't help making a splash the second she comes on screen. Ms. Kapoor-Khan is actually the weakest link here but extremely good. That's only the leads... one must give hearty praise to three vitally important women but still minor characters... Achala Sachdev and Sushma Seth, play the respective grandmothers to our heroes, and Farida Jalal as DJ the beloved nanny, are simply exquisite in their tiny but memorable roles. Each lovely lady leaves you desperately wanting more!

I'm a sucker for character so I have to break these down one by one... first up is Mr. Bachchan. He's known as Big B. in India and it fits. Everything about him is massive, physically he's a skyscraper, his intelligence shoots out of his eyes like laser beams, his charisma and charm is overwhelming. This is a man who clearly loves life and *everything* about it. Mix all of the qualities in the man with an amazing talent, and a simple truth immerges. That truth is simply this, if anyone else had played Yash Raichand, you'd hate him. Yash Raichand is an Autocrat in the best and worse sense. His actions would have been completely unforgivable if he'd been played as a villain. Mr. Johar and Mr. Bachchan were very savvy making Yash a complicated man, even a hero in many ways. He's a literal and figurative giant, but one with feet of clay. Throughout the film, you watch as Yash's stubborn pride continues to eat away at his loved ones, yet you never once will feel he is a bad or malicious man. With good reason, he's a good man, even a great one. You never forget that despite the weaknesses and the lies he tells himself, he loves his family more than life. The truth is, the person most hurt by Yash Raichand, IS Yash Raichand. Kudos to Mr. Bachchan for creating a character you can be completely furious with, but still root for.

Behind every great man is a greater woman! Yeah it's a massive clich, and not a little feminist, but in this case absolutely true! Just as nobody else but Mr. Bachchan can play Yash, nobody but Mrs. Bachchan can play Nandini Raichand. This character could easily be disliked if handled improperly, but no such thing happens. Thanks to skill, talent, and, a spine made out of pure titanium Mrs. Bachchan deftly creates a character who personifies a nearly mystical maternal love, a devoted wife, and broken woman. Not only that but if the moment calls for it, she grabs a scene from the charismatic men surrounding her and keeps it all for herself using only two lines. Then in another moment, she can take her giant of a husband and cut him down to nearly an afterthought. Don't believe me? See the movie, she can and does! I'm convinced that only a real-life wife can be capable of such a feat.

Mr. Khan I think by nature is a scene-stealer. Put a camera on the man and he does not like to let it go! For me personally, his acting style can get overwhelming. I only mention this because I have seen him act with more restraint in several films and enjoyed him more. That said, he is nothing less then brilliant in this film. He is the favorite son, he is the center of his parent's world. The family revolves around Rahul Raichand and he plays the part accordingly. During the first half, he's cocky, charming, spoiled, kind, but absolutely clueless! This is basically the character Mr. Khan perfected and patented in India as his own. During the second half, he's still cocky, charming, less spoiled, kind, and only slightly clueless. What makes his part unique here is that he isn't the hero. In fact, it wouldn't be wrong to say his character is the equivalent to the 'damsel in distress.' In retrospect, it takes guts to do it. I mean, this guy is referred to as ""The king of Bollywood, and The king of romance"" he's an icon! Rahul Raichand is in desperate need of rescuing! He makes good of every tool in his acting repertoire here. There's nothing new but sometimes it's enough just to do something incredibly well and he does. Still, in order to act with a man like Mr. Khan you cannot be a shrinking violet.

This brings me to Kajol! Thank God, they cast her as Anjali. Today in western films, the closest thing to true pairings in films I can think of is Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci. Back in the golden age of Hollywood, studios would pair stars together in many films. Astaire and Rogers, Powell and Loy, Flynn and De Havilland... such things were routine. Now, something like that almost never happens. In Bollywood, they're keeping the tradition alive and well! Kajol and Mr. Kahn have done six films together to date, this one was number five. I'll confess right now I've only seen one other, the iconic Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, (if you haven't seen it, SEE IT) and I think their magic together approaches Tracy and Hepburn territory. While Mr. Khan might be a scene-stealer who can't help it, Kajol works with it. There's no confusion about who to look at here, it's simple you look at both of them looking at each other. They're completely natural as a couple or as they say in Hindi, a jodi. From the moment their eyes meet, you find yourself thinking there might be something to that kismet idea.

As I've hinted before, Rahul is a little-over-the-top. Believe me he's got nothing on Anjali! To say she's a firecracker, is putting it mildly. Tempestuous is a more apt description, but it still feels wrong. Anjali is Rahul's equal for histrionics and then some. There is nothing about the woman that isn't passionate. Restraint is not a word in her lexicon period; it doesn't matter if the lexicon is Punjabi, Hindi, or English. Kajol bites into Anjali and any surrounding scenery with gusto, even the few moments when she's calm, she's full of passion. Although her character is like a really fast roller coaster, this is a good thing. Rahul is someone easily bored, and Anjali is anything but boring! In fact, he sums her up perfectly, ""she's slightly insane, actually she's completely insane."" Yes she is! She also walks a pretty fine line regarding bigotry here, but Kajol and Karan Johar smartly never cross it. Kajol manages to take anything approaching offensiveness and infuse it with such a deep feeling of homesickness, that you feel like Anjali would actually get along well with everyone if she weren't hurting so bad.

In the spirit of total honesty, I probably wouldn't buy a movie just because Kajol is in it, but there's no denying she played this part to the hilt, and she did a fantastic job. She's an icon in her own right, and you've got to respect a woman who panics over the amount of Punjabi lines, a language she does not speak, nails it, and steals a scene from Mr. Bachchan!

Warning! The following will probably read like a love letter to Mr. Roshan but I am *trying* to be objective here. I can say with certainty that despite my admiration I am sticking to the facts... Rohan Raichand is the hero of this film, that's not me talking that's Karan Johar. Mr. Roshan gets 5th billing here, he's the ""new guy"" compared to the rest of the cast, but he's a full-fledged superstar in his own right, even at this early point. But he's up against legends and icons, and he's responsible for holding the movie together. Without Rohan there is no plot. So it isn't like there's any pressure here right?

To put it in perspective, imagine a young actor wildly popular say like... Robert Pattinson, (I've never seen any of his movies, but he's the most popular young'n I can think of) being put in a movie with Robert Redford and Brad Pitt. Same principle here, only with a lot of musical numbers. Mr. Roshan never puts a foot or a tear wrong. I've watched this movie a dozen times since I got it, and every time I'm blown away by him. Rohan is a simple guy, he loves his family. That's it in a nutshell, simple right? Wrong! While the character may be simple the balancing act required by this performance would make a seasoned tight-rope walker cringe.

The thing I appreciated most about Mr. Roshan's acting is that in a movie filled with people who chew scenes he never once tries to be the center of attention. He's focusing on everyone else and that makes the audience focus with him. Oh yes, he's easily the best looking person on film and I would be lying if I said that it wasn't taken advantage of, but even with that, when the issue comes up he focuses on the other actor. I can't tell you how, that would be giving it away. The entire performance was refreshingly ego free, (I like Mr. Khan but he does have an ego) and because of that, you root for him.

You can't talk about a Hrithik Roshan performance and not spend a little time mentioning the dancing. The man might be the best dancer of his generation on film. I'm talking about in the movies here not all dancers everywhere, but even then he's still near the top. He defies the laws of physics, and he's the best dancer in the cast. Still, he never uses that to upstage anyone. During the last musical number when he's not center stage he adapts so that the group dance is in-synch. He never out-dances Ms. Kapoor-Khan and does his best to make her look sublime. It's entrancing to watch.

Some actors, are actors who can dance, others are dancers who get into acting, Mr. Roshan is neither of those. One skill isn't better than the other, both are superlative. It's so easy to fixate on his looks, I've often seen him refered to as ""the Greek god of Bollywood"" and frankly I'd bet he outshines the Mythical Apollo. But to write him off as just a hunk is a tragic mistake. This man still battles the stammering that's plagued him as a child yet in this film he speaks eloquent dialogue and a tongue-twister that would set my hair on fire!

He was diagnosed with scoliosis at age 21 and told that dancing well enough for movies wasn't possible. He can use swords, ride horses, and sing (check out Jodhaa Akbar for the first two, check out Kites, and Guzaarish for the singing) the man can do it all! Oh and he works hard for that perfect body, the face and eyes God and genetics took care of.

Last but not least we come to the newly wedded Ms. Kapoor-Khan! For the record she's not now related to the Mr. Khan in this film. Pooja is a wannabe ""mean girl"" who's really bad at it. I think Karan Johar might have watched Clueless one too many times. I swear, the first fifteen minutes with her in the movie is almost exactly like it, only they're speaking Hindi of course. My problem with that is this, while it works in a high school setting, I find it a little implausible for someone in college. Hey, I knew some rich idiots in college, none like 'Poo.' (What was Johar thinking when it came to that nickname?)

Like Mr. Khan, Ms. Kapoor-Khan practically made a brand for herself playing a type. In her case, various shallow, high glamour girls, with a secret heart of gold. But don't let that fool you into thinking she can't act. She is definitely capable of doing more tricks and the fact that she does these sweet but vain girl so well is kind of the proof. For other demonstrations of her talent, try Tashan and Mrs. Khanna (she's even more beautiful in both because she's got beautiful makeup).

She isn't a great dancer. She's certainly good, but not great, what sells it for me is that she knows she's nowhere near Mr. Roshan's level so she works hard and amps up the fun. Filming dance numbers is a torturous, grueling, undertaking so if an actor can convince you they're having a blast, it can make all the difference and she does. She has great chemistry with all the players, and her banter with Mr. Roshan is very funny. Despite being the week link in the cast, she does a good job.

Still, even with her talent and beauty I wish Aishwarya Rai-Bachchan was in the role! Why? Because, just like Mr. Khan and Kajol are the perfect on-screen jodi, Mr. Roshan and Ms. Rai Bachchan transcend great acting into something more. Oh well, if wishes were horses...

Special acknowledgement has to go to the kiddies in this movie. Young Rahul, was played by Mr. Khan's actual son Aryan! He was adorable. All of the kids do great jobs but I admit to some annoyance with Young Rohan and Young Pooja.

Young Rohan AKA Fatty is played by Kavish Majmudar. He certainly must have been everything they wanted, but the poor kid had the most annoying voice on the planet! I don't know if his voice was changing or if he was told to whine every line he had. Either way, the poor thing does tend to get on my nerves. He's a fine actor though, (would it have killed him to wear green contact lenses?)

Young Pooja played by, Malvika Raaj really didn't have anything to do but spout that wickedly sadistic tongue twister, but she deserves an award just for that! Unfortunately it was the only time she registered any charisma at all. But then again how could she in a role so small?

Ladies and Gentlemen the star of the kids, Jibraan Khan! I have no clue if he's related to any other Bollywood Khan's. He plays Krishi Raichand, Anajali and Rahul's son. This kid is AWESOME! But he's not a kid anymore, now. Out of a cast of scene-stealers he takes every one he's in! Unfortunately I can't find the name of the little girl who played Annette the little English girl next door, but she was a gem!

Finally, I can't wrap this up without saying something about Rani Mukerji! She has a special appearance and she's magnificent! She gets to show off her true dancing talent, she looks incredible, and she got a raw deal! In my fantasy world, someone played by Aamir Khan sweeps her off her feet, and makes her forget all about Rahul! Sorry for the spoiler but that one can't be helped.

The DVD itself is very good quality, especially considering the extremely reasonable price. If I had to complain about something it would be the lack of deleted scenes. I wanted to see Rohan interact more with Anjali and Krishi. Still I am NEVER lending this movie to ANYONE! It's mine, mine, mine! I'm so glad I bought it.",1350604800,13,16375,4.561224489795919

I held my nose through the second half hoping against hope that the director would mercifully cease and desist with the inanity that was Pooja.  Her character and storyline were Alicia Silverstone's Cher on steroids.  I was actually dismayed whenever she and Hrithik(!!!!!!!)  appeared on screen.  Oh the humanity... If you must view this  simply because it is considered a ""classic"", be forewarned.

Kareena Kapoor's part, when she was grown up and living in London, was especially fun to watch. I was also impressed with what a true friend Rani Mukerji's character was to Shah Rukh Khan's character. She put his happiness over her love for him.

1689529,3,B000063BJ1,"I enjoyed watching this film, and I have to say I was impressed by the pretty packaging. Ususally one-disc releases of movies don't have very fancy boxes. This one was nice and had a slip-cover. The movie itself was just as I remembered it from when I saw it years ago more or less.

The quality of the picture on the dvd while playing didn't impress me much, though. It almost looked like VHS at some parts, and more often than not it made me feel like I was watching a movie projected at a theater rather than a movie properly compressed and adapted for dvd. There were little black lines upon occasion, nothing truly distracting, but if you're expecting a really HQ copy of the film, this may not be the dvd for you. If you just want to see the film again because you liked it a long time ago and kind of missed it (as I did) then it's probably right up your alley. It's watchable, and it has english subtitles, although I have to say I've edited fanfiction with less typos in it than those subtitles had at times. All the same, it was an over-all enjoyable experince, and I'm pleased enough to have my copy. No real problems.

The movie itself is a good story. It's about an Indian family that is torn apart when the oldest son (who is actually adopted) marries a woman from a lower class after promising his father he would wed the woman he picked out for him. The son is disowned, and hurt at 'being made a stranger again' leaves the family for ten years thinking that his father can no longer love him. His younger brother, now grown up and college-aged, wishes to bring the family back together. He eventually does so, and there is a romance between him and his sister-in-law's little sister, Pooja, who was a sort of friend/bully of his as a child. Over-all, it's very cute, and well worth watching at least once. A nice film to have around when you have some spare time. Save it for day when you have a few hours on hand, or else watch it bit by bit, though, because it is pretty long.",1320105600,,1995,4.303191489361702

1689549,5,B000063BJ1,"Stellar production, a talented director and cast and a hefty budget won't make up for a weak storyline, something American cinema has yet to learn. I guess it helps to have something like the Ramayana to draw on as they did in Kabhi Khushi Khabie Gham (a little sadness, a little happiness) is how I think that title translates. Just when I was about to give up on this movie, it shifted into another gear.

The father of an insanely rich Indian family is a good man, but a traditionalist. He adopts a young boy and then has a son of his own. His adopted son is extremely loyal to his father and follows his every wish. His father sets him up for an arranged marriage with the daughter of a close business associate. The daughter is breathtaking, intelligent, in love with him, what could be better?

The trouble is, he falls in love with a cute little girl from a lower social station who is sweet, sassy and loads of fun, a woman probably closer to his pre-adoptive social class, unless I miss my guess.

Naturally, father disowns him, etc. etc. A movie of lesser goals would end there, but this one is just getting going. If you invest the time in it, this film rewards your patience.

1689554,5,B000063BJ1,"This is my favorite Bollywood movie (watched it many times) - it is both contemporary and traditional, concerning the rich and middle class intertwining story, with a very impressive variety of dances & music (top quality, really like them).  Today I bought the  Blu-ray disc  (available with English sub-titles since Dec. 7, 2010).

The cast is fantastic - How could you go wrong with Kajol & Kareena Kapoor, together with Shahrukh Khan & Amitabh Bachchan/Jaya Bhaduri (actual husband/wife) & Hrithik Roshan and a smaller part for Rani Mukherjee in just the first half.  Even the kids who play the 'young versions' of the brother & sister in the first half of the movie do a great acting job.

There are several scenes with a lot of crying (women and men, young & old).  Still, for me, this is Kajol's most humorous/fun character of any movie she has graced.  Her character  'LOVES to dance'  (deep in her bones & soul) and Kajol really fits that role and is so beautiful.

Kareena Kapoor's character is extremely over-the-top and hilarious (she pulls out all the stops - more extreme than 'Alicia Silverstone' did for her character in the 1995 movie 'Clueless').

Alok Nath, who often plays the 'Dad' role very well (in many movies: 'Dil Hai Tumhaara' 2002,  Vivah 2006), has a small part but is great.

Many of the same actors are together again from 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai' (1998 - also bought this on  Blu-ray disc  today, available as of Dec. 7, 2010), including the child who is always counting stars, and there is even a brief (15 second) musical homage to the main melody from 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai' in the romantic/fantasy dance music at the Egyptian pyramids
(scene 10, song 3 - 'Suraj Hua Maddham' starting at about 1:07:29 on the DVD).

The entire movie has flowing/smooth/natural acting (all actors totally commit to their characters, are in sync/prepared, giving the highest quality performances by all of them in this movie).  All of Hrithik Roshan's dancing is impressive, with his physical presence the sharpness/perfection of his dancing moves look great - lots of talent there.

The intimate & public interaction of Amitabh Bachchan & Jaya Bhaduri (real-life husband & wife) is refreshing and there are some great moments caught on film (quiet times in their home, dancing together at a party, I'm sure they are in acting mode but they are a joy/fun to watch).

The style of cinematography is top quality and unique (many scenes have a more natural feel because the director had people walk/dance in front and behind the main event/action of focus).  Sometimes you might wish that a beautiful dance scene shot didn't have the camera momentarily/partially blocked by someone passing in front, but overall it establishes the feel of the movie.

Just a great experience, even though there are many melodramatic moments, this is a very enjoyable movie.

****** SPOILER ALERT - ************
***
Actually there are 4 love stories in this movie -  In just the first half of the movie Rani Mukherjee's character is in Love with Shahrukh Khan's character, but he meets Kajol's character and falls in love with her which initiates the conflict/tragedy in the movie (those are 2 of the love stories).
And there is the ongoing love story of the older Mother & Father, and the developing love story of Kajol's younger Sister and Shahrukh's younger Brother (the other 2 love stories in the movie).
Rani Mukherjee's character is a 'class act' person, and she unfortunately loses out (but very gracefully).",1292112000,,3505,4.881756756756757

1689588,3,B000063BJ1,"The title, which means ""Sometimes Laughter, Sometimes Tears,"" pretty much sums up Hindi cinema, and the film is inclusive in another way: it embraces the transition in style and content that was well underway in Bollywood when it was released while remaining rooted in India's time-honored film conventions and cultural values.

The family unit is held in sacred regard, and the bonds of love between parents and children are often stronger than any other--except when romantic love dares to take precedence, which is what happens to the Raichands, a spectacularly rich family in Delhi. Yash (Amitabh Bachchan) and his wife Nandini (played by Amitabh's real wife Jaya Bachchan) are the zillionaire parents of Rahul (Shahrukh Khan) and Rohan (played as an adult later in the film by Hrithik Roshan), who was unexpectedly born to them nine years after adopting Rahul. In the beginning, the family is full of worshipful love for each other, exemplified in the first musical number, the title track, in which they pray to the gods and bless one other while singing and dancing goes on around them.

The wealthy are a trademark subject of the director, Karan Johar, and he consciously winks at the audience with the film's ridiculous display of affluence. The Raichand's home looks like the manor house of an English lord on the outside (even though it's in India) and an Indian palace on the inside. For transportation, they use their own personal helicopters, which drop them off on the front lawn of the grand estate.

Yash wants Rahul to marry Naina (Rani Mukerji), a family friend, who has all the class and breeding required to fit into the Raichand household. But Rahul loves Anjali (Kajol), his nanny's niece, a brash and boisterous lower-class girl who runs a sweet shop in the chaotic, colorful Delhi neighborhood of Chandni Chowk. Opposites attract, after all, and when Anjali's father dies, leaving her and her much younger sister Pooja (played as an adult by Kareena Kapoor) with no one to care for them, Rahul defies his father and marries Anjali. The stern authoritarian patriarch promptly disowns his favorite son for what he considers to be an unforgivable betrayal. Rahul and his new wife and sister-in-law move to London. When Rohan grows up, he sets out to reconcile the two enormous egos that split up his happy family.

The superb melodrama is as thick as honey and as darkly sweet, but the film is a whopping three-and-a-half hours long and the interminable musical numbers (there are 10) may test the endurance of all but die-hard Bollywood fans.

1689596,5,B000063BJ1,"KABHI KHUSHI KABHIE GHAM (Sometimes Happiness, Sometimes Sorrow) boasts as sparkling a dream cast as Bollywood can ever hope of putting together. Director Karan Johar reunites with his three stars from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kuch-Kuch-Hota-Hai/dp/B0000AZT4W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kuch Kuch Hota Hai</a>&nbsp;(Shahrukh Khan, Kajol, Rani Mukerji) and then, for extra flavor, tacks on Amitabh Bachchan, his wife Jaya Bachchan, Hrithik Roshan, and Kareena Kapoor. In India, brother, that translates to some megahuge star power. That cast alone is enough to guarantee a killing in the box office (which is in fact what happened). And, as predictable as the sun rising in the east, Kajol and Shahrukh Khan's chemistry retains its potency.

When you tune in to a Bollywood flick, brace yourself for tears and laughter, get ready to drown in vivid colors and over-the-top musical numbers. Chances are, you may even scoff at the sheer overwroughtness of the story. KABHI KHUSHI KABHIE GHAM, coming out in 2001, offers the quintessential Bollywood experience. There's nothing so new about this story, which revolves around a younger son's vow to return his long vanished brother back to the fold, after a decade of estrangement. The film follows the expected beats and clobbers you over the head with maudlin family histrionics. What makes it work are the terrific performances of the actors.

Caste and breeding matter to Yashvardhan ""Yash"" Raichand (Amitabh Bachchan), the proud, unbending patriarch of the powerful Raichand family. So the whatsis hits the fan when Yash's marriage plans for his adopted son Rahul go awry, because Rahul (Shahrukh Khan) has already fallen in love with Anjali (Kajol), the daughter of a lowly sweetmeat shop owner. That Anjali is vivacious and captivating means diddly squat to Yash, who just can't get past the notion that her station in life falls so far beneath expectations. When Anjali's father dies unexpectedly, leaving her and her younger sister Pooja orphaned and alone, Rahul decides to marry Anjali on the spot. This, as expected, enrages Yash all to bits. He and Rahul exchange words, the result of which is that Rahul is disowned. He bitterly departs, never to return. Ten years pass.

Even though Hrithik Roshan is featured in the framing segments of the film's first half (which is mostly a long flashback to what happened ten years ago), his presence is really felt in the second half. It's pretty funny, to look at this good-looking, all-muscly dude, that the character he plays, during childhood, used to be called Fatty. Fatty's real name is Rohan, Rahul's obese younger brother. Present day finds Rohan the best player in his cricket team, and I'm guessing he's implemented a good, good diet. Rohan, having been so young when Rahul left, has never gotten a full recounting of the rift between his brother and his father. When, on visiting his grandmothers, he finally learns the truth, he promises to find and bring Rahul and Anjali home to reconcile them with their father. His search leads him to London.

Not for one nanosecond do I think that KABHI KHUSHI KABHIE GHAM improves in any way on KUCH KUCH HOTA HAI, which is one of my favorite Bollywood films ever. But KABHI KHUSHI KABHIE GHAM has got its moments. First of all, the lush cinematography dazzles the bejeesus out of you, offering many stunning images and striking compositions and instantly assuring the audience that everyone involved in making this film spared no expenses and effort. There are ten songs here, some of which are impressively lavish productions, with ""You Are My Soniya"" and ""Bole Chudiyan"" showcasing Hrithik's dancing mojo. And, of course, there's that sweeping and evocative theme song. Although, I do vaguely resent that in ""Suraj Hua Maddham"" (the number set in Egypt) one could hear the strains of the theme song from KUCH KUCH HOTA HAI (Is it a rip-off or an homage?). Note too that the names of the lovers in both KUCH KUCH HOTA HAI and KABHI KHUSHI KABHIE GHAM are Rahul and Anjali (and that, in these two movies, they're played by Shahrukh and Kajol). Coincidence?

The film's second half mostly takes place in London and focuses much on Hrithik Roshan as he begins his subterfuge and ingratiates himself to an unwitting Rahul and Anjali, having passed himself off as the brother of Pooja's friend (Pooja, remember, is Anjali's younger sister, with whom Rohan has come clean and asked for help). Pooja is played by Kareena Kapoor, so it's no wonder that she's grown up smoking hot. Kareena does her shallow, perky bit, and it's a bit annoying, but this film's not really about her. Hrithik, on the other hand, is very good, especially when called on to produce unshed tears, an acting conceit which Shahrukh had long ago perfected.

I don't think I'll go into how very good each actor here is (okay, Kareena Kapoor doesn't totally suck). As usual, what was initially meant to be some quick comments have diarrhead into this lengthy thing. I'll say this: the actors do earn their paychecks and all that good adulation, and Kajol remains the most incandescent star in Bollywood (sorry, Aishwarya Rai). And, here, Kajol is also very funny. KABHI KHUSHI KABHIE GHAM has flaws which critics can gleefully pick at, it's true. It's certainly hammy enough. But one of the best things I admire in Bollywood is that its films aren't afraid to show unabashed emotion. No romance is so romantic, no heartache so torturous as when expressed in Bollywood. This film features two love stories, that of Rahul and Anjali and that of Rohan and Pooja (which really isn't as well developed). But, at its heart, this film means to demonstrate the significance of family, of one's roots and ties, at least in Hindi culture. Or as Director Karan Johar's introductory quote goes: ""It's all about loving your parents."" While I enjoyed Rahul and Anjali's interactions, I found it almost as absorbing that Anjali so desperately longs for the blessings of her father-in-law. I do wish that Kajol and Amitabh Bachchan had more scenes together. As far as the scenes between Amitabh and Shahrukh, brother, they are intense, intense stuff.

Speaking of Hindi culture, there's one neat scene in which Kajol's character, exiled to England and often prone to nationalistic moods, is gratified to hear her young son singing the Indian national anthem at a school function. Just one of the standout moments in this film, which, by the way, is three and a half hours long. So you're gonna need a whole mess of hankies.",1230940800,45,6574,5.047882136279926
1689597,4,B000063BJ1,"K3G was the first Bollywood film I saw, and my viewing it resulted in my thorough addiction to the genre.  I spent almost four hours watching this family drama, the singing and dancing, and all the beautiful actors and actresses and was completely mesmerized by the sheer pageantry of the film.  The so-so story is essentially two different love stories, set against the backdrop of intense family pressures and cultural issues unique to life as an NRI (non-resident Indian).  As with all Karan Johar movies, there is plenty of crying and melodrama, but a happy ending.  K3G is an Indian blockbuster that stars six of the biggest film stars in the Bollywood industry and features unusual, exquisite scenery and expensive, lavish costumes.  The songs, in particular, are gorgeous eye candy.

My main complaint about this film arises from several years of watching Hindi cinema, in that the melodrama and pat dialogues of this movie become less moving and more annoying over time.  However, I still recommend this movie as a nice, entertaining film and a fine overall introduction into the spectacle of Bollywood movies.  While it's not one of the best for either acting or story (despite winning several awards in the year of its release), K3G is still a solid Karan Johar production that is easy to watch and likely to lead to a Bollywood addiction.",1215648000,,1349,4.9118942731277535

Rahul (Shah Rukh Khan) adopted son of a wealthy Indian family is disowned by his Father (Amitabh Bachchan) for refusing his arranged marriage and marrying Anjali (Kajol) a poor local girl. Brokenhearted, Rahul not only leaves the family estate, but leaves India altogether taking up residence in London, England.

Ten years later his younger brother Rohan (Hrithik Roshan) goes in search of Rahul in hopes of mending the breach between father and son and restore family unity. Rohan was only a small boy when Rahul left, so when they meet again in London Rahul has no idea who he is. Rohan introduces himself saying, ""Ash, my name is Ash,"" using his Father's name to stir his older brother's memories of home.

So begins the deception. Pretending to be a college student named Yash in search of lodging he is taken in by Rahul's family. With his disguise firmly in place Rohan begins to work on Rahul's emotions and love for family and Mother India in an attempt to breakthrough the bitterness of the past.

'Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham' is one of three fantastic Indian films produced in the last couple of years. While the other two, 'Lagaan' and 'Pinjar' are not normative Indian films, this one takes advantage of all the usual Bollywood formulas. However it does it so perfectly you don't care.

The sets and costumes are sumptuous beyond belief, while the music and dancing sways back and forth between mindboggling frenzy and sweet melancholy touching every human emotion imaginable.

It looks like Bollywood is starting to gain a non-Indian following in America, and why should we be surprised? Bollywood is fun! Unlike most of the dreadful foreign films that art house lemmings go into raptures over, Americans like Bollywood films for their inherent entertainment value, not because some elite of turtleneck-wearing professors or New York film critics discerns genius in the muddled hallucinations of some Italian gasbag. In Bollywood, Americans can enjoy the kinds of movies that Hollywood used to produce, while learning about a different culture. Of course, the main thing we learn about that culture is that Indian people frequently break out into song and perform lavish dance routines in the street, but still, there are fascinating nuggets of cultural education here. Besides that though, the subject matter of Bollywood films have a universal appeal: love and marriage, family problems, tradition and modernity- and Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham has those themes in spades, along with some catchy tunes (""Say Shava Shava"" for one), spectacular dance numbers and good clean fun.

This movie has a great cast, wonderful songs and a good storyline.  The acting across the board is great with Shah Rukh Khan and Amitabh Bachan being the stand out stellar performances.  The character development is excellent, you can completely identify with the characters.  The chemistry between Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol is believable and touching.  Kareena Kapoor and Hrithik Roshan's pair is funny and nice also.

The first half of the movie is flashback. The first half of the movie is pretty good overall with a little lull in between.  There are some emotional scenes and some funny ones. The second half is perfect. It will make you alternate between laughing out loud or crying in some scenes.

The only criticisms I have with this movie is Johnny Lever is annoying in the first half (he doesn't come in the second half thank goodness) and Kajol overacts at being Punjabi in the first half a little. This movie is like a breath of fresh air after watching ""Family Stone"" and other American movies where people have sex and/or great drunk or alternately ""fall in love"" after one meeting and there is no character development or a sense of love on a mental or emotional level.  In Bollywood and in Hollywood directors seem to think less character development or the less wholesome a story the better.  But in reality after seeing how much people like this movie or wonderful American movies like Secondhand Lions, movie producers and directors should understand that there is still an audience for these kinds of family oriented movies.",1166832000,2,1751,4.945392491467577

Of course, that doesn't mean I'm not bored by the several, monotonous storylines of ""boy-gets-girl"". Of course, there are always a few exceptions that stand out from the typical trend. Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham is a shining example. Karan Johar's direction is truly amazing, and the acting is unbeatable. If Johar had cast anybody else to play any of the characters in this film, I doubt it would have been the same. That doesn't mean the film relies heavily on acting. The plot and direction individually are enough to carry the film through. The cinematography is first-rate, and each camera angle seems to have a special, radiant beauty.

1689602,5,B000063BJ1,"I have watched this movie at least a million times,and I still think it's perfect.  Maybe that's one of the great things about Bollywood.  There's literally something for everybody in just about every movie, but none more so than this one.

If you are new to Bollywood, you must watch the Holy Trinity, in the following order, and I promise you will be hooked for life.  First, DDLJ, or Diwale Dulhania de la Jayenge, or whatever it is.  It is the most popular film in the history of the world, and that's a fact.  That one stars the same couple as in this film, and there is absolutely no point ever discussing on-screen chemistry after you have seen Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol together.  They are--why mince words? perfect.  Then you must see Kuch Kuch Hota Hai.  You will catch some cool references to DDLJ, and you will see a sexier and more mature Kajol, and SRK is quite different than in DDLJ--he is thinner, more mature, and much handsomer, though he is pretty insufferable in the first part of the movie.

That's another point I'd like to make about Bollywood movies for you non-Desi newcomers to the fold.  Each movie is really two movies:  there is the fluff in the first half, and then things really get going in the second half.  Remember this when you are ready to pull the plug halfway through the first half.  Fast forward through the unbearable parts but stay with it.  Things are going to get better. Much. Much. Better.

Anyway, turning to the movie at hand, KKKG:  Having watched the previous two SRK-Kads starrers, you can now fully appreciate the musical references to KKHH and even DDLJ.  But that's just one of the treats in store for you.  This movie is indescribably rich and beautiful on so many levels.  Don't miss it.  It makes a great family entertainment, too--nothing anyone could find remotely objectionable.  Everyone I've forced to watch it has without fail become hooked for life just like I am.  Like the greatest works of art, you will be changed forever after you see it.  Before I discovered these three films, I pretty much hated movies, but now I can honestly say K3G is my favorite movie of all time!",1149638400,8,2141,4.588390501319261
1689603,5,B000063BJ1,"I must agree with the others on this one. This is a great movie. The songs were nice. The storyline was good. The acting was great.

Hrithik is gorgeous...love him to death...but i must say, Shah Khan is my 2nd favor Bollywood actor thus far..and he does great acting in my book.

One thing i thought was odd about this movie was that when Rahul left, he LEFT. He removed himself not only from his parents' life, but also his younger brother. I mean, c'mon...Rahul, you coudl have written him a letter or something, keep him up to speed...it's your younger brother...and as for his parents'...i could understand why he did what he did cuz his dad was really harsh, but his mom gave her blessing...she was not in the quarrel at all, but Rahul made everyone suffer because of his father. And why didn't the parents try to contact him...why did it take the younger bro to patch things up? The mother could have, easily. But she allowed the father to keep her from her son which i didn't understand at all. Is this reflective of Indian culture, in the sense that a wife sticks by her husband and lives by his decision? And if that's the case, the husband shouldn't have been that damn prideful. And why didn't Rahul notice his brother...even after what, 10 years...in reality, unless you've had some MAJOR change...you will recognize your family member (even if they lost weight)...but of course, if he recognized his brother, the movie wouldn't have been long at all. So, yes, I think this is a good film. Loved it. Suggest you watch it as well. If not for the storyline, then for the goodlooking Indian men!",1144800000,,1762,4.611464968152866

The story thought quite filmy is different from the ones I've watched. It has its own inertia. There are many scenes in this film that made me go numb. I saw this film in my early-late teens and I must say it came as a jolt to me.

It's a family based drama. Easily the best Bollywood has ever put out. Karan Johar wins all respect for the kind of emotion he seeks to and manges to bring out in not just the characters but the audience too. I never heard anyone talk ill of this film simply cause its flawless. Now Now Now...if I had to describe the film to someone I'd say its about a father , a step son and a son. One very underlined motive behind this film is family values.

I've seen previous films like Hum Aapke Hai Kaun and Maine Pyaar Kiya and a few others. With all due respect, I thought they were corny,overbloated and pointless. They tried to appeal to the mass audience and did but they never really struck any emotional chord with me. K3G has simple scenes that are so brilliantly directed that they actually brought a tear or ten to my eyes. I felt there was something wrong with me. Maybe it's the absolutely subtle niceness I noticed in a few characters.

Hrithik never acted as good as he did in this film. There's this nice boyish non rebellious energy in him that leaves me confused.

Jaya Bachchan was surprisingly good in the film. I have never liked her acting. Kareena Kapoor is good for her role. Kajol , who I for some reason held some contempt again delivers a great performance as a wife stuck between inlaws and her hubby. The introductions to the characters of Shah Rukh Khan and Hrithik were just outstanding.

A very well thought out film. I noticed quite a few people cry shamelessly at the absolute feeling of being benighted in a lot of people who watched this film. Me for one.

K3G was the very first bollywood movie i saw. Almost immediately you are dragged into the world of colour and beauty that is missing from hollywood films. The storyline surrounds a rich indian family and what happens when you follow your heart instead of what others want for you; in this case the patriarch of the family played by Amitah Bachan an icon in bollywood. Rahul, played by Shahrukh Khan who by the way gives an awesome performance- is the oldest son of the family and is all set to take over the family business when he meets and fall in love with Anjali(played by Kajol) the niece of the lady who raised him who is unfortunately from the ' wrong side of the tracks' so to speak. His father on the other hand has already chosen a wife for him and when he refuses and marry the one he loves he is disinherited and moves to London. All of this is told to his younger brother Rohan played by bollywood lastest sensation Hritik Roshan,by his grandmother ten years later. At this point the movie has lost its colour and good vibes as it show a family torn apart by the separation. The mother played by Jaya Bachan mopes and grieves for the son that was ripped from her side by her uncomprimising husband whose word is law in the family. Rohan sets out for London to look for his brother to try to repair the damage done to his family and to return the joy that was missing from his mother's life. Rahul now lives with Anjali and their son Krish along with her sister Pooja who later becomes Rohan love interest in London. Rohan reignite the friendship he had with Pooja and gained access to the house wrangling an invitation to move in with the family so that he can try to find a way to get them to come back home. This second half of the movie while not as fun and lighthearted as the first half show all the things Rohan does to get the family back together and at the same time his courtship of Pooja. The climax of the movie happens when he strategises a meeting between his parents and his brother in a local shopping mall. The reunion between mother and son is so poignant and heartfelt that you can't help but to be dragged into the emotional scene as their eyes meet after ten long years of separation. Yet still nothing is resolved as the father still won't bend. The grandmother dies and the location moves back to India. Here the mother tries once again to have her son and husband talk through their problems, after another refusal she stand up to him and tells him exactly what she thought of him,at the same time, Rohan is pleading with Rahul to come back atleast once to visit his mother, to end the rift that separates the family, to put a smile back on his mother's face. This leads to a meeting between father and song that is emotional but true to real life and can be parallel to other father son situations in everyday life. This movie took me through a range of emotions. You laugh at the lovebirds antics and fall in love right along with them; you'll hate the father for his stuborness and snobby attitude and grieve with the mother who loses her heart and joy which was her son but also cheer her along when she stands up to her husband. A bright and colourful movie that invites you into a family from the other side of the world just to find they are no different from you own. The songs will become favourites and you find yourself dancing along with them. The chemistry between the cast is electrifying as a well chosen cast rarely is. You will not be disappointed and this will become a favourite in your collection garunteed.

1689614,4,B000063BJ1,"The perennial struggle of a couple who, being in love, goes against the traditions instilled in them by their parents, is common fare for the Indian cinematic industry (Bollywood). What makes ""Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham"" (K3G) so markedly distinct from the vast sea of Bollywood films that concern this topic, and what makes K3G much more meritorious, is its intimate portrayal of what happens in the aftermath of this conflict. Where typical Bollywood blockbusters such as ""Saathiya"" and ""Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai"" focus more of their story on the lives of the young couple that seek a relationship at the expense of severing the bonds with their families, K3G tends to emphasize the guilt and pain incurred by all sides - both children and parents - as children are estranged from their parents, when parents dogmatically preserve tradition, and children break free from the shackles of tradition, and rush headlong into romance. K3G gives a complex portrayal of Indian marriages and how central family life is to the whole affair, while also being empathetic to both the plight of the tradition bound parents and the romantically linked children, something uncharacteristic of Bollywood productions.
K3G starts off when Rohan (Hrithik Roshan), who spent many years away from his family in boarding school, returns home. When Rohan inquires about the reasons behind his older brother, Rahul's (Shah Rukh Khan) departure, his grandmother tells of the events that lead to his brother severing ties with his father, Yashovardhan (Amitabh Bachchan), and his doting mother, Nandini. Hence, nearly half of K3G is told in a flashback. We learn that despite Rahul's adopted status, he is clearly the favorite of the two, ironically I suppose, because Yashovardhan and Nandini chose Rahul when they thought they could not produce a child naturally, hence Rahul seemed like a Godsend. Rahul, though reciprocating the intense love his parents had for him, eventually betrays, unintentionally, the patriarch of the family by falling in love and eloping with Anjali (Kajol), a girl who comes from a working class family whose background and lifestyle are much in contrast to the wealth, prestige, and opulence, that the Raichands enjoy. Thus, Rahul is disowned by his father. In the rest of K3G we see Rohan, who Rahul does not recognize because of years of separation, trying to coax his brother and his father into mending their relationship. Throughout this process we see how the void left by Rahul's flight and his father's dogmatism are affecting the family. Though Rahul has prospered financially on his own, with a seemingly bubbly family life, there is a definite sadness that wears on Rahul's face. Yashovardhan and Nandini though ostensibly close in the beginning of the film, are now slowly growning detached from each other.
The acting from the three main stars (Bachchan, Roshan, and Khan) is superb. Each actor suffuses his performance with believable pathos. Granted tears flow so readily and profusely that they - especially Roshan and Khan - could probably fill up the Ganges ten times over, and this fact maybe a sign of overacting, but given the nature of the story, a little sappiness fits nicely. Yashovardhan's wife (Jaya Bachchan), is a woman who in keeping with her traditional role, stands by her man, even when he is mule headed. Yet at the same time Nandini shows uncharacteristic strength for a traditional Indian house wife, when she finally confronts her husband's stubbornness, and through some poignant dialogue that gives a tempered feminist reflection on conservative Indian culture, that respects tradition, but at the same time puts her husband and his pride in their place.
The flaws in K3G are apparent when it decides to depart from its substance at specific intervals in its story, and seeks to be visually and verbally ostentatious. Maybe the producers, director, and writers behind K3G thought this would entertain western audiences, but like all other attempts at Bollywood to emulate the west, their efforts come across as just plain unnatural, or downright tacky. There are more tactful ways to demonstrate the affluence of the Raichands than by constantly showing them flying in planes, helicopters, having brand names emblazoned on their clothing (Indian film makers apparently forgot the subliminal portion of subliminal advertising) or driving a Lamborghini across a college campus. Sometimes I felt more like I was watching an Indian version of ""Life Styles of the Rich and Famous"" than a movie. Secondly, there is no need to interject trite English phrases into the dialogue, like when Roshan says ""What's up Dad?"" or when Pooja (Kareena Kapoor) obnoxiously exclaims ""Its raining men"", whenever she gets boy crazy.
Since we are on the subject of gaudiness and superficiality, no one embodies this more than Kareena Kapoor. Here is a bit of advice for Bollywood producers and directors concerning this actress. Number one: SHE IS NOT GOOD LOOKING - she is just one of those ugly girls, like the ones you knew in high school, who got in with the popular crowd because her sister was attractive. Number two: SHE IS NOT A GOOD ACTRESS - if you are going to articulate western clichs don't get an actress who sounds like a FOB articulating western clichs. Number three: A WOMAN WHO BEHAVES AND LOOKS LIKE A FLOOZY- will turn off a mature audience. Bollywood would do well to never have Kareena Kapoor star in another major motion picture. Besides, her mannerisms and appearance are wasted on cinema when they would be better suited for other lucrative professions, say...as prostitute on the streets of Mumbai.
Once you can overlook the loud display of commercialism, unrealistic demonstrations of wealth, and the most irritating offense to the eyes and ears, Kareena Kapoor, you will appreciate a film that has a lot of heartrending substance to it. You will witness a film that is quite a rarity in this day and age - one that sees the value in the spontaneity and romanticism of the new world and the traditional laden culture of the old world.",1073606400,5,6078,5.06686626746507
1689615,5,B000063BJ1,"This is one of my favorite two Bollywood films. If you watch this film and ""Kuch Kuch Hota Hai"", you will be hooked on Indian films. You will know what Bollywood is all about.

This is a story about a man named Rohan (Hrithik Roshan) who wonders what happened to his older brother Rahul (Shahrukh Khan). He overheard his grandmother talking about how Rohan's father asked his eldest son to leave home because he fell in love with a girl from the village. Rahul married the village girl and moved to London. So Rohan sets about a quest to find his older brother in London and bring him home to their father to try to make amends. Rohan's and Rahul's father (Amitabh Bachchan) is too proud to admit that he misses his son and knows that his wife (Jaya Bachchan), is traumatically heartbroken and without peace with Rahul gone.

This is a very colorful film which really flaunts the lifestyle of the filthy rich. All the costumes are so beautiful, and all the songs in this film are truly enjoyable. This film also stars Kajol, Kareena Kapoor, and a small part with my favorite actress Rani Mukherjee. If you saw ""Asoka"", this is also where you saw Shahrukh Khan and Kareena Kapoor together. And if you saw ""Mission Kashmir"", that is where you saw Hrithik Roshan. And also, if you are familiar, at all, about Bollywood films, you will know that Amitabh Bachchan is the most famous actor in the world (perhaps only the US may be the least familiar with him).

Karan Johar has just released his third film called ""Kal Ho Naa Ho"" which stars (again) Shahrukh Khan, and also Saif Ali Khan, and Preity Zinta (also in ""Mission Kashmir"") . Pretty soon, you'll see how easy it is to start collecting movies of your favorite Bollywood stars. To download pictures of these stars and stills from these movies, just Google some of their names, and you will find them.
