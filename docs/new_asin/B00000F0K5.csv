I WILL TRY to steer clear of these productions in the future. BEWARE OF OLD WESTERNS OF POOR QUALITY.",1376006400,,270,4.313725490196078
1199940,5,B00000F0K5,Love the old westerns and Gene Autry is one of my very favorites. You get a sneak peek at Roy Rogers before he was cast in his own movies.,1374364800,,138,3.793103448275862
1199941,4,B00000F0K5,"Back in the day, I always enjoyed seeing Gene Autry & John Wayne movies for 10 cents (1950's).  It is good to be able to see them again, on my TV.  I gave it 4 stars which may be stretching it because the plot is simple and its in black & white but the restoration was good and its neat seeing this old movie.",1372636800,,309,3.8125
1199942,5,B00000F0K5,I love Gene Autry and Roy Rogers too. Always a predictable happy ending and a few laughs in between. Never fails to cheer me up!,1360454400,,128,4.16
1199943,5,B00000F0K5,"Ken Maynard was one of our greatest cowboy stars. An incredible trick rider, he specialized in dangerous stunts and had them filmed in close-ups so his fans would know he was the real deal.
Unfortunately. Ken had a problem. When he got to drinking, he turned into a bully, mean, sometimes violent. His fellow actors were afraid of him.  Producer Nat Levine put up with this nonsense to complete ""In Ol' Santa Fe,"" then said adios forever to Ken Maynard  and asked supporting player Gene Autry to star in his next western, ""Phantom Empire."" Five years later Autry was named the most popular screen star in the world.
Gene was not entirely happy all those years at Republic Pictures. A claus in his contract entitled the studio to much of his earnings from radio shows, rodeos, and endorsements. And there was the matter of ""Block Buying."" You wanted to show an Autry western at your theater, you had to agree to show other Republic westerns as well.
Boss-man Herbert Yates was not agreeable to explaining his business ways to an employee whose paychecks he signed, so Gene quit and joined the Army. Immediately, Yates replaced him with young Leonard Slye, lead singer of the Sons of the Pioneers, and changed his name to Roy Rogers.
Here we have Gene and Roy together riding happier trails.",1359072000,,1289,4.724444444444444
1199944,5,B00000F0K5,"The Old Corral, 1937 film

The film begins in a nightclub during a police raid. People scurry to get away. In the office one man boasts of causing the raid; he is shot dead. The shooter realizes a woman was there! She flees in a taxi, the police (and others) seek Eleanor Spencer everywhere. We see an old bu with the engine in front. Gene sings while driving a wagon. The bus horn scares the horses - a runaway. Sheriff Gene takes his prisoner on the bus. A tree across the road stops the bus, the passengers are robbed! [Did you recognize one of the bandits?] Sims (the gambler) sends a man to follow the girl in a gray suit and brown hat. ""You betcha."" Smiley Burnette shows his skill as a musician, and comedian. Gene takes extra horses for his pursuit of the highway robbers. The flat tire is changed without a jack. Can ""Jane Edwards"" trust Sims? Should she? ""The Blue Moon"" doesn't give its customers a fair deal. Can Sims be trusted?

""Jane Edwards"" sings while Gene plays a guitar. Then Gene sings and yodels. Gene handles an unhappy customer. A telegram tells Scarlatti where the Spencer girl is hiding. There is a parade in Turquoise City before the celebration. Festivities begin with a Spanish dance. A telegram tells Gene to hold the Spencer woman for extradition to Cook county. Gene rounds up Buck and Tom to join their brothers. There is another song for entertainment. A new touring car arrives in town with five men from the big city. Scarlatti tells Sims how things work. Sheriff Gene sings another song. The five O'Keefe brothers sing, then follow Sheriff Gene to the Old Corral. Smiley drives away with Eleanor [stunt doubles?] while pursued by the Scarlatti gang. Smiley shoots the driver of the car, the others scatter on foot to attack from all four sides. Eleanor knows how to shoot a rifle. Gene catches Scarlatti, they roll under the car to escape the stampeding cattle. Gene locks up Sims, Garland, and Scarlatti. So there is another song for a happy ending. Gene kisses Eleanor.

This story is a change from the usual in its use of big-city criminals in a small town. This movie has so many interesting facets to make it better than average. You may also question the probability of parts of this story, but its only a movie designed to be dramatic. The popularity of Gene Autry may be due to his character on the screen.
The ""Eleanor Spencer"" character is named Hope Manning in the credits.",1280707200,3,2421,4.586605080831409
1199945,5,B00000F0K5,"Roy (billed as Leonard Slye) and the Sons of the Pioneers (all appearing as the singing O'Keefe brothers) rob a bus??? in which sheriff Gene is transporting wife beater (in film only) Frankie Marvin. Also aboard is a girl (Hope Manning) fleeing Chicago mobsters after witnessing a mob murder. The destination is Turquoise City. Lon Chaney Jr. is a gangster, Smiley Burnette a deputy, Oscar and Elmer are gas station attendent/ rubes (think Goober & Gomer) and there are plenty of songs, fights, shootings, fast cars and even faster horses in this wild B-Western that defies reality and logic in this amazingly wonderful 1930's Depression-era escapist Extravaganza!!!
Cowboys vs gangsters!!! Tommyguns vs six-shooters!!!
Kind of like Al Capone comes to Dodge City.
The Sons of the Pioneers sing SILENT TRAILS in jail. Gene pardons the O'Keefe boys if they join the posse. Gene gets the girl.
GREAT STUFF all 'round!!!
Buy this Alpha dvd, the image is very clear/sharp for a public domain issue. I keep it alongside my Image Gene Autry dvd collection.
A great buy for the money and a great Gene Autry movie on so many counts!!!",1240444800,,1125,4.926315789473684
1199946,3,B00000F0K5,"An engaging Gene Autry musical-western that clocks in at 54 minutes. Directed with breezy flair by Joseph Kane, ""The Old Corral"" (1936) features plenty of action, Smiley Burnette's comic relief, plus an early appearance by Roy Rogers and the Sons of the Pioneers (who sing ""Down Along the Sleepy Rio Grande"" and ""Silent Trails""). It's also great to see Lon Chaney Jr. play a slimy henchman three years before his screen breakthrough in ""Of Mice and Men."" Republic's ""B movie"" craftsmanship provides the ideal showcase for America's Favorite Singing Cowboy.",1230076800,2,556,5.188888888888889

I can relax on Saturday mornings and watch this movie over and over.  I have even gone as far as to join up with the original site for these movies, but I will still order more from Amazon as well.  I would recommend this movie as a great classic.",1162771200,4,359,4.085714285714285

Reminds me of the Saturday afternoons I spent in the movies while my mother visited  with friends and neighbors on the streets of Dublin, Texas.  Cheap babysitting, and I loved watching them as long as it took for her to get her visiting done.  Dublin was a small town and the country folk came to town on Saturdays to shop and visit.",1437177600,,504,4.319148936170213
1200016,5,B00000F0K5,"This is a simple and very predictable early Western featuring Gene Autry and even Roy Rogers in an uncredited role.  In this film, Roy Rogers is the leader of the O'Keefe brothers, a group of entertainers who are broke and turn into highway bandits.  Gene Autry as the gun opposing sheriff sings some beautiful songs in this movie.  His singing is definitely his strong point for his acting is stilted.  And the lady singer is a beautiful singer who portrays the gangster's moll trying to flee from his clutches.  There is a charming cattle stampede that saves the day in the end.  And overall, it is a light classic ""spaghetti"" Western that is suitable for family viewing.  The Sons of the Pioneers also sing some really nice songs in the very old style.",1411344000,,755,4.631578947368421
