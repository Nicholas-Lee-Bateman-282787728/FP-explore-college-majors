4492111,4,B004X63RWU,"Another of those rare ""Limited Edition"" MGM  DVD releases, of which I now have many, and none have so far let me down. An excellent B/W widescreen print, a cracking plot, (tho lacking in any mystery element), and a good western cast - Bill Williams being his usual sturdy self, Gloria Talbot as a (beautuful) Indian maid Was there any other kind? and Gloria was lovely if unusual in her looks, shame she never made it really big time). If ever there was a glorious piece of miscasting it's Ted De Corsia as an Indian chief! Admittedly not as excrutiating as his perf in ""Mohawk"" which has to be seen to be believed, but he is pretty bad here. Darn it - he was New York street gangster -! There are good perfs from Walters Baldwin and Sande, and strangely unbilled John Cliff who is good (perhaps in the role De Corsia should have had) in an important part - why no billing? Also Kenne Duncan, Charlie Stevens and a very (very) brief cough and a spit from Boyd Morgan. Plenty of action, lots of shooting and a couple of brief fistfights, and not too much lovey dovey stuff. 67' of heaven for me, even tho I admit this is perhaps not the finest ""B"" western ever made, but for true western fans, it's recomended but do observe the price and be sure you want it. As usual, for plot synopsis see the excellent Dr Nagi's review. Happy Trails from the U/K.",1329177600,,1349,4.353174603174603
4492112,5,B004X63RWU,"This movie was first released in 1959(2011), in widescreen 1.85.1, B/W and runs 67 minutes. The sound and picture quality are very good. There are no extras on this DVD. The film starts in 1872, when Oklahoma Territory belonged to 5 Indian tribes, living across the border with white man and divided by FORT SMITH. Temple Houston(BILL WILLIAMS)District Attorney, hears gunshots while riding his horse and on arrival finds Indians and Cowman in gun battle. He finds Cherokee Chief Buffalo Horn (TED-DE-CORSIA) there saying he and his braves were surprised by these gunmen. When Temple stops the fighting, he finds that the gunmen are legal posse come to arrest Buffalo Horn for the murder of Indian Commissioner, Alan Barbee. Buffalo Horn agrees to go with Temple, but denies murder. In Town, Larkan, who had actually killed Barbee, reports to his boss Bigelow (GRANT RICHARDS). Later Buffalo Horn's Daughter Ruth Red Hawk (GLORIA TALBOTT) and his son Running Cloud (X BRANDS), ride into town. Ruth pleads to Temple to let her father go. Temple says her father will get justice in Fort Smith. Temple and Marshall's men clear the mob come to hang Baffalo Horn. Temple is shown Buffalo Horn's knife found in the back of Barbee. Tom Bulger, is a witness, who claims he saw Buffalo Horn throw his knife at Barbee, and had heard an argument between Buffalo Horn and Barbee. Buffalo Horn admits that the knife belonged to him and that he did have an argument with Barbee, but he still says, he had not killed Barbee. Marshall locks Buffalo Horn in Jail. Temple goes to Barbee's house and finds his journals. Ruth says her brother Running Cloud will go to war, if her father hangs.
How will this end? Will Buffalo Horn be found guilty? Will his son go to war and kill more white men? Can Temple prosecute Buffalo Horn with the evidence he has? Why does Bigelow want a war between Indians and white men? Is Buffalo Horn Innocent or guilty? What will the jury decide in the court of Law? What will the Cherokee Indians do? Have Temple and the Marshall got the whole trial right or wrong?
This story of ORVILLE H HAMPTON is beautifully photographed in widescreen by WALTER STRENGE and briskly directed by EDWARD L CAHN. All actors give good performances.

4492136,4,B004X63RWU,"Bill Williams (TV's Kit Carson) a stalwart B star plays Temple Houston (Son of Sam Houston and the youngest lawyer in Texas history)  when he was 35th district of Texas district attorney.  The storyline has him prosecuting an Indian chief and convicting him.  He then finds out the chief was innocent and aids in his escape while he finds the evidence to free him.  Interesting story when you consider the real life Houston spoke English, French, Spanish and 7 different Indian languages and was well known for his courtroom antics.  Three years after this film Jeffrey Hunter would play the savvy Temple Houston on television.",1402617600,,627,4.933333333333334
