So I like watching music docs from the comfort of my house, but this one was underwelming.  It got great reviews and  official selections from prestigious  film fests so I had high expectations. It was noteworthy though. I was bummed that there wasn't extra footage of Slint. The Portishead footage is the best thing about this doc. Love Beth's voice..greatness!",1382400000,,518,4.608695652173913
8378097,4,B002QXIMSQ,"After watching this, I'm still confused on a lot of how these events came to be (and continue to exist).  The video aspect is fine, but the experience ends up being like going to see one of your friend's friend's bands...you just want to leave at times but you can't, and your curiosity gets the best of you in the end.  I won't be watching this doc over and over so I gave it one-less star than I would have if it was more informative and less about the drunk or high kids who attend the festival.  I think it would be an excellent recap if instead of lumping the years together, why not release each year as its own DVD.  That would provide time to look at the fans as much as the artists, and it would give time to some of the better acts that were at the festivals instead of a local trio playing outside their room.  (No hate towards those bands, but there are a lot of established popular artists who never got represented by this doc at all.)",1290988800,,949,4.163934426229508
8378098,5,B002QXIMSQ,"I saw this at the Seattle International Film Festival this spring.  Made largely from fan-submitted footage, the DIY nature of the festival is perfectly emulated here.  There's full-up high-def, multicamera footage next to super-8 and cellphone video.  The editing here makes the movie though, and it is some of the best I've ever seen.  Every single minute of this movie is totally stunning.  I and the other pepole lucky enough to have seen during the spring this walked out of the theatre with our heads spinning, and the glow lasted for days.  GET THIS DVD AND TURN IT UP LOUD!",1258156800,3,581,4.76
