1108124,3,6305972796,"At the beginning of ""Cobra Verde,"" a defeated rancher, Francisco Manoel da Silva (played by Klaus Kinski), looks at his drought-ruined land and says ""The water, the earth, and the sun turn black.  God, in his perplexity, pretends it's his will.""  This couplet seems to be not only the theme of this final cinematic collaboration between Herzog and Kinski, but indeed the theme of most of Herzog's films.  Nature, although awesome and sometimes lovable with a fierce, savage love, is never trustworthy.  The same goes for men and women:  those with power will usually wield it to their own advantage.  Even God, if there is a God, can only stand by and watch, puzzled, impotent, victimized.

""Cobra Verde"" offers a parable of this red-in-tooth-and-claw world by following the career of the rancher turned bandit da Silva, a strange and ruthless man who leaves Brazil for Africa to jump-start the slave trade.  While there, da Silva (whom the Africans call Cobra Verde) encounters a deeper, more primordial savagery than even he can harness, and eventually is defeated by it.

The film is spectacular from a cinematic perspective, particularly the final scene.  The colors are vivid, the longshots rarely tedious, and the composition, especially at the African king's adobe court, sometimes breathtaking in their geometrically proportionate perfection.  But the film overall has a patchwork feel to it.  There are gratuitious scenes in the film--the dwarfish tavern keeper mysteriously talking about the land of snow and ice, for example (perhaps this scene, if it's in the Chatwin novel on which the film is based--a novel I haven't read--makes more sense in print).  More disappointingly, it's obvious, even before listening to Herzog's lament in the accompanying DVD discussion that Kinski wasn't really artistically present on the set, that Kinski's performance is lackluster.  Kinski is typical crazy Kinski in a couple of scenes, and chillingly brilliant in one at the beginning of the film where he murders a mine foreman (""Wake up.  I want you awake when I kill you!""), but for the most part seems detached, slightly bored, and weary of it the project.

All in all, then, ""Cobra Verde"" is the least satisfying of all the Herzog/Kinski collaborations--in hindsight, it's good that the two decided to call it quits--and one of the least satisfying of all of Herzog's films.  But let's face it:  even a bad Herzog film is better than most others.  So ""Cobra Verde"" still rates three stars.",1215302400,,2492,5.078624078624078
1108125,5,6305972796,"Aesthetically, this is probably one of the most visually stunning movies ever made. Many of the scenes are unforgettable and are a true tribute to the cinematographic genius of Werner Herzog. But as always with Herzog, this movie comes with strings attached. This is as far from ""Roots"" as you can get. There are no heroes here, just villains and victims, and as always, Kinsky's presence in the center of it all is as intense as it is disturbing. Even the contribution of some African tribe leaders to the slave trade is exposed without any complacency. Greed and desire for power drive men and events, with little or no room for human redemption, or even basic decency. If you can accept an uncompromising vision of slavery through the eyes of a slave trader, then this movie may provide you with the most realistic sense of how it was perceived by those who carried it out without a second thought at the time.  This movie is extremely powerful and leaves a print on your mind. How you interpret that print is left to you, as in most of Herzog's movies...",1194739200,3,1058,4.597883597883598
1108126,3,6305972796,"The last and least of his volatile collaborations with Werner Herzog, Cobra Verde is possibly the one movie where Klaus Kinski isn't the maddest person on screen - he's out-madded by not one but two African kings who make him look a model of logic and reason: when even Werner Herzog describes one actor as a ""very odd man,"" you'd better believe it. After a hypnotic opening the first third is sluggish at best, but once Kinski's South American barefoot bandit (""I don't trust shoes"") reaches Africa to reopen the slave trade - more in his employers' hope that he'll be killed than any belief he might succeed - it's a rollicking yarn and the most spectacular of Herzog's films, ending with an image that's almost Fitzcarraldo in microsm as Kinski struggles to pull a longboat into the sea while a native cripple watches him. It's a mad film in many ways, with Kinski finding himself leading an army of Amazons because the men simply aren't good enough warriors, but like all Herzog films it has its rewards, including some striking and haunting imagery, not least a shot of Kinski in the sea watching the sky.

Sadly, this has the least satisfying transfer of any of Anchor Bay's Herzog films - acceptable, but with niggling image problems, particularly in the early scenes. Extras are limited, though Herzog's audio commentary is, as always, captivating.",1181260800,,1356,4.819742489270387
1108127,3,6305972796,"Klaus Kinski, always on crazy duty, here shows up as Cobra Verde, a slave leader who seriously ticks off his master by going on an impregnation spree and is thus sent to Africa on a suicide mission. His stated goal is to revive the slave trade but everybody involved knows that he is being sent there to die. Verde is only too excited to get dressed up in his Christopher Columbus get up and sail the ocean blue, not bothered in the least by the fact that nobody ever expects to see him again. Once there he has some initial luck with the natives until it runs out and he is kidnapped for being white. Quickly thereafter he is rescued by a man who feels as though the throne is his and wants Verde to help him seize it. So just like Emilio Estevez did with those darned Ducks, Verde takes a group of losers and transforms them into winners, only instead of being good at hockey these guys are turned into a maniacal killing machine.

Since this is a Werner Herzog movie we know that the focus will be on the uncaring ways of this Earth of ours. Both leaders, the plantation owner in Brazil and the king in Africa, are shown to be the same despite the color of their skin. They both lack morals and believe their own hype. But Herzog isn't interested in building these guys up as evil doers; his films don't need pre-packaged villains because to him we are all villains. When the plantation owner bemoans the fact that he has yet to impregnate every mulatto girl in his fields it is not with the intention of painting him a racist or a rapist. Rather the point is that all men in power are the same. They always want more and will stop at nothing to get it. Verde is an interesting character because throughout the film he is constantly in a position of power, always lording over a large number of blacks, and yet appears to be uncorrupted by it. We never learn his motivations, whatever they may be. The final shot is very telling however; as Verde runs away from a cripple he is unable to make his getaway because he can't move a boat from the beach to the water. Here is a man who overthrew a king, but only because of those he ruled over. Without them he can't even escape the hell he created.

The charge of racism has been leveled against Herzog on more than one occasion and this film couldn't have helped. Dozens of extremely dark blacks fill the landscape as slaves who live under the boot of a white man. A white man who spends his days teaching them how to fight like savages. That said, and let me be very clear; this film is an ugly glimpse into the primitive nature of humanity not an attempt to proclaim white superiority. If the roles of the races look stereotypical it is because stereotypes are based on facts. There is all the difference in the world ever between being racist and reflecting a racist world. In the film the whites view the blacks as nothing more than slaves and sex toys, and the blacks view the whites as the devil. I would say that that is a fair assessment of race relations circa 1850. I liked ""Cobra Verde"" but in no way did I love it. The first 30 minutes are dull but after that the plot gets rolling. There are also some awesome shots of the African countryside which become even more impressive when Herzog fills them with the sheer number of extras he had on hand. Not one of Herzog's greatest films, but a strong, unblinking look into our past. ***1/4",1175904000,11,3398,4.341194968553459
1108128,4,6305972796,"'Cobra Verde' is at times a confusing and awkward story about a bandit who finds himself trapped within the slave trade business.  What begins as a story of a feared outlaw turns out to be a story examining African cultures and the issue of slavery itself.  What makes this movie more interesting than other American films about slavery is that the viewer gets to see the other side of the story; the story told from an African viewpoint.
International star Klaus Kinski stars a Cobra Verde.  He is a feared bandit whom many people fear.  When he appears in a small town, all the people runs inside their houses becasue they are scared to death of him.  Many things are missing from Cobra Verde's past.  How did he become such a feared bandit?  The movie does not answer that question.  Through a series of odd circumstances, he is eventually put into the slavery trade business by a group of rich aristocrats.
He is sent to Africa, where it is hoped he will be killed because of the slave trade conflicts going on there.  What happens is th exact opposite.  He gains the trust of the African villagers and eventually trains an army to kill and enemy foe.  All the while the viewers are treated to an inside look at some African customs, religions, superstitions, and society.  A beautifully made film that is a little marred by changes in the sequences of the story and many things missing from the plot.  Even though 'Cobra Verde' contains flaws here and there, it has one of the most memorable death scenes I've ever seen.  Bravo to Klaus Kinski.",1131753600,2,1549,4.585454545454546
1108129,5,6305972796,"Klaus Kinski, the mercurial actor and star of hundreds of films both big and small, attained his grandest stature when working with German director Werner Herzog. They collaborated on several films together, including ""Aguirre, the Wrath of God,"" ""Fitzcarraldo,"" ""Woyzeck,"" ""Nosferatu,"" and ""Cobra Verde."" I've seen three of these films now, and the formula is the same in all three. Kinski plays a driven personality who attempts to perform some grand feat that no one else can achieve. In ""Aguirre"" he set out with a contingent of Spanish soldiers to find the fabled city of gold. ""Fitzcarraldo"" saw Kinski playing a wealthy rubber baron in Brazil in search of finding a way to build an opera house on the banks of the Amazon. ""Cobra Verde"" continues the tradition with Kinski starring as a former South American plantation owner and bandit leader in search of a way to restart the African slave trade against crushing odds. There's something magnetic about Kinski in these Herzog movies that makes you believe no other actor could play the character. Perhaps it is his volcanic personality shining through onscreen, a personality that Herzog had great difficulties in restraining. Whatever the case, film fans could do worse than spend an evening with a Herzog/Kinski collaboration.

In ""Cobra Verde"" Kinski plays Francisco Manoel da Silva, a man ruined when family catastrophes and a bad drought cost him his plantation. In an attempt to recover his property and put his life back together, he takes a grinding job with a mining company. When the owners try to shortchange him after a hard day's work, he stomps off in a rage and begins a career as the notorious bandit Cobra Verde. While we don't see his subsequent career as a robber and killer, we do learn that all of Brazil--indeed, all of South America--has at least heard of his great exploits. Fortunately for Kinski's character, the wealthy sugar baron Don Octavio Coutinho (Jose Lewgoy) doesn't recognize him when Cobra Verde somehow calms a dangerous runaway slave. Impressed by the man's talents, Coutinho hires da Silva to work as an overseer on his enormous estates. Everything seems to go gangbusters until da Silva impregnates every single one of Don Coutinho's mulatto daughters. The sugar baron goes ballistic, and gets even angrier when he discovers he is dealing with the great Cobra Verde. Coutinho and his fellow kingpins devise a plan to rid themselves of this potentially dangerous force. They decide to send him to Africa.

Why? Because the land barons in South America want more slaves in order to work more land. There are obstacles to the mission, including a ban on the importation of slaves and a hostile African king who kills all of the European mediators. Da Silva knows none of this, or very little of it, before agreeing to go to Africa. He doesn't have much of a choice since the sugar barons will kill him if he refuses. His ship sets him ashore at Elmina, a gigantic barracoon on the coast of present day Ghana. Cobra Verde discovers that an attack on the fortress wiped out all but one man, a chatty free African who agrees to help da Silva negotiate with the King of Dahomey for more slaves. And it works, at first, when da Silva convinces the representatives from Dahomey to trade slaves for new rifles. Then problems set in. The king brings Kinski's character before him and threatens him with death. Da Silva escapes and makes an alliance with a prince who wishes to take over the throne. Thanks to Cobra Verde's manic military training of thousands of African women, the prince captures the throne and allows the slave trade to continue. Once again, the situation deteriorates after a time, forcing Cobra Verde to flee from Elmina with nowhere to go. The last shot we see of him is one of the more memorable scenes I've had the pleasure to see in a film. It stays with you.

The plot of ""Cobra Verde"" isn't nearly as interesting as Herzog's visuals and Kinski's performance. As always, Kinski captures emotional extremes extraordinarily well. He's subdued when Don Coutinho shows him the brutality of the plantation or when he converses with the Don's daughters. When training the prince's army, he's practically frothing at the mouth. Kinski is never anything but entirely believable in both situations. Of course, it takes a performer of Kinski's caliber to stand out in films where the visuals are often more important than the human elements. Such is the case with ""Cobra Verde."" I have two favorite scenes in the film, but there are many just as memorable. The first situation takes place when da Silva refuses to visit the king because he says he must stay where he has one foot in the ocean. When the king's men tie da Silva up, they take a jug, fill it with seawater, and tie it around his foot for the long trip inland. There's your one foot in the water! The second scene involves sending messages from Elmina to the new prince. A line of Africans extending for miles along the coast, each man separated by a few feet, send codes by waving enormous red flags. Herzog's camera lingers on this incredible imagery for minutes at a time.

Included on the disc are a trailer and a commentary track with Herzog. The director discusses his tempestuous relationship with Kinski (always a fan favorite), his experiences with Bruce Chatwin and how he convinced this author to let him use ""The Viceroy of Ouidah"" as source material for the film, and the difficulties of shooting in so many harsh environments. While I liked ""Cobra Verde,"" and think it is obligatory for Klaus Kinski fans, I much prefer ""Aguirre"" and ""Fitzcarraldo"" to this film. Still, this one will make you think long after that last, lingering shot on the beach.",1102982400,26,5729,4.819105691056911
1108130,5,6305972796,"COBRA VERDE marked the fiinal collaboration (not counting the director's elegiac documentary MEIN LIEBSTER FEIND) between Werner Herzog and actor Klaus Kinski. It's one of their most haunting works, quietly epic in its scope, fueled by gorgeous cinematography and and an enigmatic lead performance. Herzog's commentary is wonderful. COBRA VERDE is one of those films I find myself rewatching in bits, if only to recapture for a moment the funereal magic of a lost world.",1045699200,6,470,5.28

1108132,5,6305972796,"As many other films and characters created by Werner Herzog, Cobra Verde explores the extent to which cruelty and obsession can lead an individual  to his own moral and human defeat. Settled in some west African country,  the film is a recreation of the horror of the slave trade embodied in a  charatcer, astonishingly played by Klause Kinski, whose amorality and  thirst for absolute power equal the madness of characters such as  Fitzcarraldo and Aguirre. Like these other two films, also Cobre Verde  explores the darkest side of human mind and soul with a clear reference to  a very precise historical experience. The three characters share the same  obsession for domination and conquest which proves to be fatal to many  individuals including themselves. The last scene of the film is absolutely  mesmerizing and, at least to me, unforgettable. Cinematography and  photography are superb.  It is sorprising that it is almost impossible for  those who would like to see this film again to find it anywhere to rent it  out.",966988800,30,1028,5.005917159763314
1108242,3,6305972796,"Klaus Kinski showed up and gave the best performance any actor could with this rather dull script.  I just don't know what Herzog was trying to say here.  Is it that a man might drift into the slave trade who truly doesn't have a racist bone in his body?  Is it that a small time robber might find himself with no other employment options?  Is it that Brazil flipped against the institution of slavery so quickly that this kind of eccentric drifter was set up to be a convenient scapegoat?  The whole thing lacks the spirit of adventure and doom that ""Aguirre"" had.  The intensity of Kinski is able to overcome some of these limitations, but one viewing is more than enough.",1395619200,,674,4.483606557377049
1108243,1,6305972796,"This film starts with a grand idea for an expensive blockbuster film with a cast of thousands.  Like other Werner Herzog films, it requires the great actor Klaus Kinski to express extremes of emotion as he faces insurmountable obstacles leading to failure, exhaustion and death.  The final, most memorable scene with Kinski dying on the beach could be one of the greatest in movie history. The fatal flaw in this movie for me trying to enjoy it (others will disagree, especially if they want action and emotions only) is that the execution of the intended plot loses its trajectory and slips into something with too much randomness and chaos.  The second most memorable scene for me was a huge uncountable field packed with African women holding big spears with Kinski ranting the need to get pumped up to vanquish the enemy but with no field-general direction pertaining to how and why they should do this.  Some of the women tried to look fierce and dedicated while others shuffled around or giggled.  The movie could have important ""what to avoid"" value, but seems unworthy of purchase for entertainment.",1384041600,,1107,4.898395721925134
1108244,5,6305972796,"I bought the Kinski/Herzog box set and to be honest I wasn't expecting much from the rest of the films aside from Aguirre and Fitzcaraldo but this one really surprised me. The cinematography is amazing and you get the feeling that lots of research went into this film to make it as historically/culturally accurate and surreal a production as possible. Of course Kinski makes a flawless, psychotic performance as usual. Maybe flawless because he was never really acting at all. The subject matter is dark but when has Herzog ever made a cutesy Hollywood type movie anyway? Bottom line - if you liked Fitzcaraldo and Aguirre The Wrath Of God, this film has the same epic nature and it feels like Herzog has reached his film visionary peak in his final collaboration with Kinski.",1312848000,,777,4.8059701492537314
1108245,5,6305972796,"Francois Truffaut once called Werner Herzog the world's greatest living film director. He's certainly my favorite, for several reasons, many of which I have trouble articulating in words. I've seen 20 of his films and read all of his published writings.

I first saw Cobra Verde on a bad VHS copy years ago. At the time I didn't know this movie existed, so when I happened to stumble across it and realized there was one final Herzog/Kinski collaboration, I couldn't wait to see it. This film was the least known and seen of their work together, and went for years without a proper video release until Anchor Bay did it justice on DVD with audio commentary and remastered image and sound.

As with most Herzog films, the story behind it's making is as interesting as the film itself, and can be found in the exceptional documentary My Best Fiend.

Whenever I think of Cobra Verde, two images first come to mind: 1- the opening 360 degree pan across a barren, cracked desert strewn with dead animals and skulls ending with Kinski glaring madly up into the camera, his life in ruins due to drought. And 2- Kinski stepping off the small rowboat into the African surf for the first time, wearing a black coat and hat, his white hair blowing in the wind, looking like some lunatic version of Napoleon as he sees the fortress that he'll be living in.

I won't recount the entire plot here, as many other reviewers have already done a great job of that. Let me just say that the Herzog essentials are here: a character existing on the extreme far edge of civilization, a view of unforgiving landscapes shot in stylized fashion, an exploration of language, customs, and rituals of obscure and faraway places and isolated peoples, and an intense central performance with a main character trying to accomplish an impossible task.

Of utmost importance in the Herzog universe is the blending of fiction and reality. His documentaries are all quite stylized and directed, just as his fictional films contain a capturing of real events happening as you see them and included as part of the fictional tale. The use of non-actors, even in major roles, also contributes to this adding of an edge of truth and purity to the films. An honesty.

There is no one else who makes films quite like Werner Herzog. Each of his movies are unique. None are bad. You may like some better than others, but all of them deserve to be seen. In this age of big-budgeted remakes and sequels with bad acting and CGI effects, for me all of Herzog's movies are essential viewing.",1291420800,5,2542,4.662946428571429
1108246,4,6305972796,"After having watched the entire series of Kinski/Herzog collaborations, I felt a bit tired for this one.  It is the portrait of a perfectly awful misanthrope, who starts with nothing, establishes himself as a thief to be feared, and is hired for his talents with slaves, i.e. how to frighten them into being manipulated by vividly portrayed brutality.  He goes from Brazil to Africa, a tour of nowhere that ends with nothingness.  You get the clash of cruelties of old civilizations with new-world greed, truly deadly and at times mesmerizing.

But at this point, Herzog's obsessional themes are clear, indeed almost rehashes:  a single man, through sheer will and utter ruthlessness, can for a time control his environment.  But they are alienated and ultimately cannot consolidate their gains, heading into the oblivion that they have spent their whole lives trying to keep at bay.  At this, Herzog is singularly effective and Kinski is the perfect vehicle for the nihilism.

This is not fun to watch, but it is an interesting evocation of the chaos and cruelty.  (""I want you awake when I kill you"" is typical dialogue.  I will definitely watch Aguirre again, as it is the definitive masterpiece and viewing it feels endlessly fresh.  This felt a bit stale, perhaps because I was on a binge, but still...

With amazing images, principaly in its disturbing and superb  end, it portraies with extreme sensitivity the typical passions of the human being, as the insatiable craving  for power. Of course, everything is shown with the extremely touching ""touch"" of Werzog.

1108248,5,6305972796,"Of the five Herzog/Kinski films, ""Cobra Verde"" is my favourite. It is very incoherent, a far cry from the tightly wound dramatic narrative of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aguirre-the-Wrath-of-God/dp/6305972761/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aguirre, the Wrath of God</a>."" But it has the most outlandish, demented imagery of any Herzog film, and that is saying a lot. The visuals are indelible in nearly every scene.

The film seems muddled because it simultaneously tries to accommodate both Herzog's and Kinski's ideas, which were very different from each other. The first half is heavily influenced by Kinski, who wanted to present his character as a dashing, charismatic anti-hero. This part of the film is heavy on deliberately iconic, heroic images (in the audio commentary, Herzog calls it a ""spaghetti western"" style). Kinski speaks in terse pronouncements that hint mysteriously at his deep loneliness and noble character. The story also makes sure to emphasize his success with the ladies. Every woman who sees him immediately goes crazy with desire, whereupon he impregnates her and continues on his lonely and mystical journey.

This is extremely self-serving. Kinski's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/autobiography/dp/0140255362/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">autobiography</a>&nbsp;suggests that he thought of himself this way in real life. His success with women was also very important to him, he brags about it on every page. Here, in his penultimate film, he surely wanted to create a legacy in which people would view him exactly as he wanted. Thus, in a strange way, this bizarre and unrealistic character has more of Kinski in him than any of his other cinematic incarnations.

But don't think I'm mocking him. In a way, this is the best part of the film. In the movies, you can get away with this stuff; cinema is all about artifice, and with Werner Herzog directing, the most banal grandstanding takes on a beautiful and unworldly quality. There is a short scene in the beginning where Kinski seduces a woman by the ruins of a church. The content makes no sense, but it looks gorgeous, astounding, Kinski's barefoot gun-toting outlaw and a beautiful woman in the picturesque ruins, with Popol Vuh's evocative ambient&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/score/dp/B000F6ZP54/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">score</a>. Another seduction scene takes place in the jungle and is equally lush and sexy (now there's a first for Herzog, a singularly sexless director).

The second half changes tone entirely. Through various plot devices, Kinski's character gets shipped to Africa, where he ends up in a desperate situation reminiscent of both ""Aguirre"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fitzcarraldo/dp/B00001ODHV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fitzcarraldo</a>."" He tries his hand at the slave trade, and the film touches on the theme of colonialism, to the point where it surprisingly resembles Gillo Pontecorvo's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Burn/dp/B000B6CO3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Burn!</a>"" in places (the protagonists are quite similar, and engage in similar political intrigue with the locals). But, this being a Herzog film, that aspect never really becomes the focus.

In fact, nothing really becomes the focus. Kinski's character engages in the usual callous self-abandon common in Herzog films, but he becomes much more of a cipher. He is caught up in spectacular events, but he's mostly being carried along by them, with no time for characterization. He gets one line later where he seems to understand the evil of his actions (the ""our future murderesses"" line), but that's all, and the film doesn't follow up on it. At the same time, he does not engage in mad dreams of glory like Aguirre, nor does he have any obsessions like Fitzcarraldo. It's hard to say what is keeping him going.

It is really very strange. The first half of the film tries to create an image of an ""honest rogue"" or noble Robin-Hood type. It is hokey characterization, and not very successful, but the film definitely makes an effort. But in the second half, it's as if none of that ever happened, and Kinski becomes more of a desperate and cruel wild-man, though his reasons are unclear the whole time. You see why it's muddled.

But the second half is bursting with brilliant set-pieces. It does not have the majestic grandeur of the river or mountains in ""Aguirre."" Those images are exotic, but can still be understood and admired through the language of an ""ordinary"" aesthetic sensibility (not the best way of saying that, but you know what I mean). The world depicted in ""Cobra Verde"" is completely alien, ungainly and disconcerting in every way. It's too inexplicable to be beautiful, and that makes it more real and terrifying than anything else Herzog has ever filmed. Like, for instance, the angular dance performed by the masked warriors when they take Kinski prisoner, or the crazed battle in which Kinski leads a chaotic army of screaming naked women. But even less important scenes have this air of unfathomable strangeness, like the system of waving flags that is used to communicate, or the shot of the female slaves in the well. At some point, Kinski fades into the background amid this unhinged flurry, which ultimately leads nowhere, because the plot seems to just cut off without warning.

And at the end, the protagonist surfaces again for the tragic final scene on the shore. One wonders what Herzog wanted to say about him. Herzog mentions his ""evil"" in the commentary, but he's not prominent enough by the end to be an embodiment of evil. All the characterization occurs in the beginning, where Kinski tries to make him into a misunderstood hero. And, oddly, that's the most sympathetic part; the contrast between the first and second half makes Herzog's worldview seem even colder than usual. Kinski, on the other hand, comes across much like his character -- a deeply confused man who is always raging against whatever adversary he has at the moment, but who has absolutely no conception of his life beyond the current battle. And throughout all this is the cinematography, like nothing else on earth. It is an inarticulate film, but you may end up returning to it many times.",1238803200,,6400,5.503560528992879
1108249,5,6305972796,"This is just as great as the other Herzog/Kinski films. I saw it when it first came out, over twenty years ago, because I'd read the Chatwin book and had been hugely impressed. However, the film doesn't have that much in common with the book, and I came out rather baffled and disappointed. The imagery was still fantastic, nevertheless, and has stayed with me. Watching it again, having forgotten most of the book, I think as a film  it has matured, and I was better prepared by having also just run through the others, Aguirre, Woyzeck, Fitzcarraldo, Nosferatu. These films have to be absorbed as a succession of ultra-powerful images. There is no great narrative continuity or explanatory plotting in any of them. You have to fill in the gaps for yourself. But the performances and the visuals are fantastic. In fact, you have to relax your built-in linear thought-mode, and just let the pictures soak in. Not that there aren't some good lines, many good lines actually. Slavery was a standard economic fact of life ever since humans invented the concept of property. African tribes enslaved each other readily, and thought nothing of it. There was nothing racist about this, it was just dog eat dog. Nature's way. Britain's abolition of the slave trade is slowly being recognized as the most remarkably altruistic  political act since the beginning of history. Every picture in this picture burns into the memory. The ending. Those singing girls. That enormous derelict fort. The Prince who was only feigning madness. Thanks to the reviewer who explained the foot in the ocean --- I hadn't twigged it.",1221436800,,1605,4.897058823529412
1108250,4,6305972796,"It is a good film, but not nearly on par with such classics as Aguirre: The Wrath Of God, Nosferatu, Phantom Of The Night, nor Fitzcarraldo, and it is a film even Herzog has expressed dissatisfaction with. The film was written by Herzog, who adapted it from a novel by Bruce Chatwin, The Viceroy Of Ouidah; but it's probably the least affecting screenplay of the major Herzog-Kinski films, as well as the film the two made together that has the least for Kinski to do- i.e- strut his stuff and dominate whole scenes. Things move far too quickly and illogically, there is little explanation of scenes and events, and little in the way of character development, in either the lead character or the few minor characters that say anything. The cinematography is- as usual, excellent, and there are often quotable snippets of dialogue, but, as a whole, the film fails to capture the imagination the way the above named films do. Cobra Verde (the character as written- not Kinski's superb acting) is simply not that compelling a figure, for he has no grand divide within him. He is a brute and a scoundrel, and little more. After this film, Kinski and Herzog had a final falling out, and Kinski died a few years later.... Kinski shows he is a great actor throughout the film. Cobra Verde declares that he does not trust shoes, women, horses, and little else, and has that glower that only Kinski could do. That alone is mesmerizing enough. Had only there been more such moments in this hour and fifty minute film the film may have achieved greatness, but as the main character is never fully realized and the narrative is patchwork- at best, the film is merely a good but uneven work of art. Yet, despite this, a little perspective is needed, for a flawed film by Werner Herzog is significantly better than most any other film a lesser filmmaker will make. By mortal standards, this is not a bad film, at all, but from this great filmmaker and his legendary star- who together left three indisputable masterpieces: Aguirre: The Wrath Of God, Nosferatu, Phantom Of The Night, and Fitzcarraldo, as well as the excellent and enigmatic Woyzeck, it is a bit of a disappointment. Too often it steals the best ideas from earlier and better Herzog films, and never reinvigorates them adequately to suit their inclusion in this film's cosmos. Perhaps it is this knowledge that is behind Herzog's final disappointment with his own film. If so, he is correct in his assessment, and that very awareness is the reason Herzog is such a great artist, for understanding greatness is a deeper and rarer thing than achieving it, for, as I have said, `Greater than transcendence is its recognition.' Herzog has done both in his career, although only one shall have to suffice in Cobra Verde.",1221004800,3,2766,4.740663900414938

7899331,3,6305972796,"This movie is anti slavery (aren't we all?).  At least that is what I got from it.

Klaus Kinski (Cobra Verde), a bandit in South America, is sent (banished?) to Africa after he manages to impregnate the three daughters of a sugar cane baron in Northeast Brazil. The (slave) trading company, based in the northeast state of Bahia, never pays him a penny, but manages to get rid of him, and the collective Brazilians breathe a sigh of relief.  Meanwhile, internationally sanctioned slavery is in its dying throes and the British navy is patrolling the high seas, boarding suspect vessels and seizing their human cargo, and (hopefully) prosecuting the crew.

Kinski arrives in Africa to wait for ships from Brazil bringing payment for African slaves that never arrive, and so he gets caught up in the intertribal politics that was West Africa at the time.  He is captured by one king only to be rescued by warriors of a rival king.  Finally, he leads a bunch of women to fight (men are too scared) another clan.  The entire movie is this confusing.  Cobra Verde is a horrible man, but many people will do almost anything for him.

Great scenery of the West African coast, and sad scenery of Brazil's sertao (northeast), eternally parched with dying animals all around.

I did not really understand the meeting of Kinski (the bandit Cobra Verde) with the proprietor of the restaurant bar at the beginning of the movie.  The bar owner told Kinkski of high, snow-capped mountains half a year away by the transport of the day.  At the end, Kinski repeats these words and thoughts as he lays dying on the West African coast, rolling in the Atlantic surf.

I did not think this movie flew very well because a 60 year old Kinski was not a credible South American bandit.  He was not mean enough.  Someone like Arnold (the German speaking Terminator) or even Clint Eastwood would have been much better.  But then the movie would have been noticeably not Werner Herzog.

But beautiful images of West Africa, nonetheless, and terrifying glimpses into the world of slavery.

If you have little better to do, Rick says check it out.",1497225600,,2118,4.724795640326976

Their other collaborations such as ""Fitzcoralldo"" or ""Aguire, the Wrath of God,"" were masterpieces of cinema, so I was expecting something similar, or even close.  But many of the scenes looked like out-takes from a National Geographic special of the kind often, humorously, referred to as ""native scenes.""  There was a lot of dialog dubbing, so everyone in the cast spoke German, leaving the non-speaking viewers wondering if the African cast was speaking with a Ghanian accent.
This movie is for Herzog/Kinski fans who are seeking to complete their bucket-list of seeing all movies by this German team.",1427673600,2,714,5.02542372881356
