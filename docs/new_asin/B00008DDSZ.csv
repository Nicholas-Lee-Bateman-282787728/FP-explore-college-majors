1839266,4,B00008DDSZ,"I have been a die-hard Prince fan ever since Controversy.  This DVD is decent quality but it seems as if it was ripped from VHS.  A few skips... but the Subtitles were done by an individual that is obviously not a Prince fan.  The words are so way off base on many instances.  The quality of the DVD does give it a ""Concert Feel"" though.  Most of this was shot in Paisley Park <or so I have heard> but the fact the quality is not exaclty DVD kind of gives it an ""authentic"" feel.  But the subtitles are sooo far off base on many instances.  I know this because I know every word 2 every Prince song,, B sides and all.  But being that u can not get this released by WB yet,,, it is good.  Die hard fans go 4 it,, novices that like him during Purple Rain years u may be let down.  But Die-harders,, go 4 it.  The guy is STILL phenomenal and I still feel no one can hold a candle 2 him.",1049932800,,883,3.9322033898305087
1839267,2,B00008DDSZ,"Let me start off by saying that I gave this disk 2 stars because it is Prince. beyond that, i highly recommend that you pass this one up. After waiting since early February, I finally got it today(April 10th). I expected problems when all the packaging was in spanish with a different cover picture. i put it into my player, and that's where the real dissapointment came in. The picture is awful. The sound is awful. the so-called dolby digital sound came mostly from my center channel speaker. I had to actually walk over to my other speakers to see if anything at all was coming out of them(very little). The quality of the sound is also awful(muffled). I pulled out my old VHS copy that i was hoping to retire, and it is far superior even after 15 or mor years of heavy use. Do not buy this disk unless you are just looking for disappointment.",1049932800,5,846,4.3949044585987265
1839268,1,B00008DDSZ,"I excitedly ordered this from the UK because I have longed for this to come out on DVD for years. Frankly, you'd be far better off ordering the existing VHS edition from the US, which i already have. This DVD was not recorded in the US (I think Brazil) and whoever has committed it to DVD has basically just lifted the VHS tape onto a disc. The sound and visual quality is therefore even poorer than the VHS edition and to say I am very disappointed is an extreme understatement. I will be sending my copy back tomorrow and I can't believe that an organisation of such usual high quality as Amazon is stocking this without explanatory notes. When is someone finally going to recognise that this film deserves proper re-mastering treatment and re-release? It is, after all, Prince's finest hour and the best live performance film I have ever seen. Very upset indeed.",1049673600,2,865,4.623376623376624
1839269,5,B00008DDSZ,This is (finally) the dvd version of the Prince concert/album of the same name! I had hunted for a video copy of this for the lonest time. This has one of Prince's best albums captured. The whole thing rocks from begining to end! Can't wait to add this to my collection! Has Sheila E and Shena Easton too!,1044316800,3,305,4.275862068965517

7981966,5,B00008DDSZ,"I was lucky enough to buy this imported from the UK and plays on my PC. This concert film done in 1987 is OUTSTANDING! simply outstanding! Well filmed, great songs from a  great album! I have NO Idea why this is out of print in the USA! Now that his Royal Purpleness is no longer with us, please release this great concert film on DVD so we can all enjoy the see the true musical genius that was PRINCE!  RIP Prince!",1461542400,3,416,4.1234567901234565

7981968,1,B00008DDSZ,"The original VHS is great but this DVD is NOT! This copy is made in another country. The video quality is horrible it is very DARK as you can't see the audience and can barely see the band. If you ever tried to copy a VHS tape
then you know how the copyright protection darkens the picture to prevent copies being made. Also the package pic on Amazon is NOT what you get, what you get is a photo from the Purple Rain Show with info written over it in white letters
and on the back you have sort of a track listing not all the songs done are listed. Buyer beware of these copies they are not authorized by the company and a authorized DVD has not been released yet. If you look at my pic of the back it shows a capture from the original VHS. That is how light  it should be for the whole show. I was at that show for the taping and have the VHS.",1440633600,,844,3.935672514619883
7981969,3,B00008DDSZ,"First things first: while there may well be Brazilian bootlegs floating around, most copies of this will be of the 2004 Canadian release (the film was originally released by a Canadian distributor; Alliance bought that company but could not release the DVD in the US). As for the fact that there are no supplemental materials on the disc, and that the video quality is frankly subpar, chalk that up to Prince's non-participation in this release.

if you are any kind of Prince fan, you will want to own this  this, and Purple Rain, are the only two documents of Prince in performance that are still available. Particularly noteworthy are the two songs with the most different arrangements from the album, Forever in My Life and If I Was Your Girlfriend  both are enhanced by the band's presence and Prince's own effects-free singing.

It would be nice if Prince authorized a deluxe release of this, complete with additional concert footage, but in the meantime, at least this is available.",1426032000,,989,4.869047619047619
7981970,1,B00008DDSZ,"The disc I received was such a poor quality item ,I couldn't watch it for more than ten minutes!  The cover was different from the picture I saw online. Aside from the title, all words were in Spanish.",1401321600,,201,4.2894736842105265
7981971,4,B00008DDSZ,"....considering the fact that this is:
a) an import
b) a film that was made 16 years ago
and
c) completely unavailable in a domestic version
....I think any true fan of this film shouldn't be too upset with this DVD. I originally decided against purchasing it, based on all the negative feedback posted here. But, today I happened to see it in a store...the only copy on the shelf....and I said, ""man I'll hate myself if I find out later that it was decent and I didn't pick it up""...needless to say, I now own it.
My expectation level was decidedly lowered, considering all that I had read but, I was pleasantly surprised.
Despite previous testimony to the contrary, the picture & sound quality generally are decent throughout 99% of the DVD. (hey, the DVD is in 5.1 surround....that's more than I can say for a lot of other discs of films that old) There ARE a COUPLE of imperfections in the audio, where the sound drops (think-worn VHS tape).
It's not even close to being as bad as a bootleg, though. It looks and sounds like what it is...a transfer from an old analog film to digital with minimal post-production.
Yes, if this was an AOL-Time Warner release, I would expect the remastering to have been done much better....but it's a Brazillian import!!!.....and considering Prince's current relationship with his former employers, don't expect to see a domestic version until he's dead (or at least not actively recording anymore).
Wait if you feel you MUST have a superior quality copy, but you may be waiting for awhile.....for those of you, like me, who aren't counting on a US release in the immediate future...this may be your best bet.",1062028800,9,1646,4.698961937716263
7981972,5,B00008DDSZ,"I thought it was absolutely amazing! Who cares that the cover had a few foreign words on it...It's an IMPORT! I promise you, Prince sang in English! It was an awesome performance. He used cool stage scenes and kinda made it like a mini movie. I recommend any TRUE Prince friend to buy this DVD.",1054684800,,294,4.363636363636363
7981973,2,B00008DDSZ,"Let's get one thing straight: Prince's Sign O' The Times (1987) is a masterpiece, and that goes for the album as well as this movie... That's why it hurts me, as a Prince-fan, that this fine work of art got a REALLY lousy transfer to DVD... It already begins with the box: spelling errors, and pictures from other eras than Sign O' The Times. Ok, for some people it might nog be a big deal to have a 1984 Purple Rain-picture on a box of a 1987-film, but hey: why didn't they just use the sleeve of the VHS-tape? Oh well, what's really important is ofcourse the disc itself. The picture is very dark and the sound is very flat, even near mono if you ask me. The subtitling is so poor that it almost becomes amusing: full of errors!
A masterpiece like Sign O' The Times deserved a better treatment than this; this DVD looks like a cheap bootleg. In fact: it probably is, because nowhere on box or disc can I find logos and catalogue-numbers of record-company Warner and movie-company MCA (which is the company that released Sign O' The Times, if memory serves me right).
People please: stay away from this DVD and wait for a proper, official release in the future (I hope that's not whishful thinking). Or try to get the Laserdisc-version, that was released sometime in the 90's, that one was pretty acceptable...",1050105600,42,1311,4.489539748953975
7981974,1,B00008DDSZ,"This is a Brazilian DVD that is a lame copy of the original film on VHS tape. This is not an official release. Scenes are missing, the picture quality is dark and it's not even in stereo. You're better off buying the VHS tape - at least that's the real deal and better quality. That said, this movie rocks! Just don't buy this DVD...",1050019200,20,333,4.21875
