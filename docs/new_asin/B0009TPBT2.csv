2318487,5,B0009TPBT2,"Parts of video were quite grainy, not sure if intentional to give feel of older program.  Acting very well done, along lines of Solder, Sailor Tinker Spy.  More like this one should be made.",1390867200,,190,4.5588235294117645
2318488,1,B0009TPBT2,"Perhaps expectations were lower back in the '70s, but the plot makes very little sense and is not very compelling anyway, and is not a patch on LeCarre cold-war spy thrillers.  And Morse/Inspector Lewis offer better Oxford based murder mysteries.  Stamp and company make a valiant effort but it is to no avail.  The bath scene with Du Sautoy is cringe making in its attempt at sexiness.  Her 'interrogation' scene at the hands of some cult (reconstituted Carnaby Street hipsters?) is feeble and involves some totally unconvincing psychological duress. The student protest scene at the end is laughable, although notable for an early role for Art Malik.  Quality leads and quality support are all wasted on this mish-mash.  I'm not familiar with the Anthony Price novel to know if the fault lies with him or with the adaptation to the screen.",1389657600,3,841,4.929078014184397
2318489,2,B0009TPBT2,Terrible audio. This might be an interesting movie if they took it through digital processing and cleaned up the sound. It sounds like they recorded the whole movie in an echo chamber of an old scratchy record (more likely an old scratch 35 mm film role).,1389571200,3,255,4.565217391304348

2318491,1,B0009TPBT2,Movie was based on a book.  I did not read the book but the movie was slow to develop and was not good.,1376611200,,103,3.4782608695652173
2318492,5,B0009TPBT2,"This was a fun walk down memory lane. It reminded me of the Avengers and although the release date was ""2005"", it was re-released at that time and it must have been from the late 1960s. I really enjoyed it.",1375747200,,206,4.175
2318493,4,B0009TPBT2,"Why 4 stars, and not 5?  I must confess I only did that because the quality of the video is VHS at best, but then this is an old film. Based upon the novel ""Colonel Butler's Wolf"" by English author Anthony Price it is a brilliantly crafted film that fills its hour and a half perfectly.  Compared to today's attempts where you can easily leave the room for ten minutes and not miss anything significant from the overstuffed plot this film has practically no padding, and its tight twists will keep you wondering to the last.  Terence Stamp leads up a convincing cast in an enjoyable film that relies on good storytelling rather than special effects!",1372204800,6,649,4.577586206896552
2318494,5,B0009TPBT2,Just brilliant. A thoughtful and stylish thriller that keeps you guessing till the end. A very British drama without special effects or even much in the way of sets that relies on dialogue and plot to hold your attention and interest. I only wish there were more in the series.,1364256000,9,277,4.56
2318495,2,B0009TPBT2,Less-than-thrilling account of an agent (Terence Stamp) whose former life as an Oxford don stamps his world with chuntering inertia.,1342569600,2,132,5.65
2318496,4,B0009TPBT2,"English author Anthony Price wrote a string of 19 well-crafted novels dealing with espionage, published 1970/1989, within which are depicted adventures of an Oxford University Professor of history, with a specialty in Arabic, Dr. David Audley, whose exertions doubling as a British intelligence agent during the Cold War for the United Kingdom's Ministry of Defence were related in an esteemed series made for television, ""Chessgame"".  This engrossing feature film, DEADLY RECRUITS, having as its source the third novel in the group, ""Colonel Butler's Wolf"", is an interesting tale having virtually no padding.  A growing number of academically superior Oxford students are experiencing either defamation, leading to expulsion, or sudden violent death, and a veteran Master at the University, an erstwhile spy, requests for Audley (Terence Stamp) to assist in the affair because he fears that the KGB is behind the tragic incidents, as a method of destroying a breeding ground for Western intelligence operatives.  Audley is initially skeptical, but soon begins to believe that the astute Master is, indeed, on to something sinister, and he thereupon decides to intertwine his own wife, Faith (Carmen du Sautoy) with his customary staff in an unconventional and hazardous endeavour to overcome the Soviet Forces of Evil.  This is the final of three features released in conjunction with ""Chessgame"", and although it is less effective than the best of the trio, COLD WAR KILLERS (1986), it nonetheless profits from a largely realistic and intelligent screenplay, efficient leadership from director Roger Tucker, and first-class editing by Paul Griffiths-Davies.  As with each entry within the extended Audley canon of Price, whichever the format, all of the primary characters are participants in a riskful game, the ground rules of which devolve upon a single gambit: that of acquiring more information than one must divulge, with a result that double and triple crosses are recurrent.  The designing by James Weatherup is appropriate as ever, and minimalist scoring of Christopher Gunning contributes strongly to the film's sequences of suspense.  Each member of the cast is competent, with Stamps, du Sautoy and Michael Culver all excellent, as will be expected.",1150934400,28,2264,5.451428571428571

In the days when costume pictures had a sort of renaissance-60s to present, whenever Hollywood feels like it,I'd guess -T.S. crept into US cinemas w/'charge of the light brigade,tho I feel vague w/this particular title,but definitely in the classic 'Far from the Madding Crowd'.Loved that cinema persona. Now,the fair part?I started but quickly got crashed by unwelcome party. And that was the end of Recruits part,never got to the Deadly. I will be restarting early a.m.,wed.,tom.,as I miss this talented actor. He's one of those few Brit.imports who didn't go through the sieve(Shakespearean stage),I suppose,to earn his place. His abrupt absence after short run is another story. I'd star this film more were it not that I have yet to see it. However,T.S.films bears his Stamp of good entertainment. Some of his recent movies,a departure from his 60s/70s films, ---were not in equal footing w/his talents--my personal opinion. Deadly Recruits. Don't know why,but something now reminds me of M.

A small group of protestors comes marching out of nowhere (shades of Monty Python) to protest a South American dictators arrival at an archeological dig.  The rest of it was pretty good.  It helps to see the prequel.  I think it is called the Allenby Ambush. The actress who plays Terence Stamps wife has great lungs. She could have been a life guard.  This is not a Hollywood shoot'um up.  More like a John Le'Carre movie.,1435708800,2,538,4.659574468085107

The cast are a mix of modern and veteran actors that gives it the flavour required for the setting in Oxford.

2318525,4,B0009TPBT2,"An Oxford professor and secret service operative (Terence Stamp) attempts to ferret out Soviet agents placed as students in the elite British education system, and intended to later rise through the ranks of the government.

Made for UK's ITV broadcast network in 1986 as the first part of the six part 'Chessgame' series, Deadly Recruits is shown here in an old film to video transfer where the video tape has aged badly, with washed out colors, fuzzy pictures and terrible sound. This is unfortunate because it is a well written spy movie, though a bit below the BBC's 1979 Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy series.

It is so much of its time, with references to real life Soviet spies then in the news, and set in the world of British academia, that it could well be challenging to a present day audience to appreciate.

American audiences in particular will have a hard time understanding this movie -- even if they are familiar with the Inspector Morse series -- with its very English, and old fashioned short hand references to upper middle class academic life, the secret services, and the elite Oxford/Cambridge education system.

For those who persevere -- maybe with the subtitles turned on -- this can be a rewarding movie.",1415318400,2,1226,4.8238095238095235

The movie is dated but it's quite an interesting plot.  If you're not familiar with British TV, it might not be for you. Unfortunately, the audio quality is abysmal.

2318529,4,B0009TPBT2,"It was made a long time ago, but did not detract from its appeal.  Some of the characters are a little wooden, hence the four stars instead of five.
