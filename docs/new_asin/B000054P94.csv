8171713,5,B000054P94,"This great DVD contains four classic California punk shows originally released on VHS (Flipside Video Vols. 1 and 6).  Two early punk bands, the Weirdos (in 1986) and the Dickies (in 1985) are paired with two hardcore bands, Circle Jerks and Bad Religion (both in 1984).  A multiple-camera setup is used for each show and the loud sound seems to be from the soundboard, preserving the chaotic shows in all their ragged glory.  The bands blaze through their sets as the stage divers dance among them and sometimes grab the mikes.  Get it, you punk!",1176163200,7,547,4.726315789473684
