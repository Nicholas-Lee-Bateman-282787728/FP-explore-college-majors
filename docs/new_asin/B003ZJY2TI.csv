8410506,1,B003ZJY2TI,"If you are looking for a dvd that simply talks about this 1969 concert, then this dvd is for you.  Yet if you are wanting the actual video footage of the Madison Square Garden concert of vintage 69 Stones, oh dear!
  We know that the film exists, because the ""Gimme Shelter"" dvd has several songs excerpted from it, but the film is collecting dust on some shelf somewhere in the world.  I would dearly love to see it, and I would pay top dollar for it, if I only could get my hands on it.  But a dvd of people talking about it... not for me!",1301702400,18,541,4.066037735849057
8410507,1,B003ZJY2TI,I love the Rolling Stones. I think I have ALL their cd's and own alot of their dvd's. This is I think by far the worst one! I was under the impression I was getting a live performance of the actual Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out. But that was not so. It was more a documentary and just alot of talk. No Get Yer YA-Ya's Out dvd if you ask me.,1210204800,,330,3.7285714285714286
8410508,2,B003ZJY2TI,"Although the title ""fires your imagination"", this DVD, contrary to expectation, is essentially disappointing. Instead of showing how the Stones built up the masterpiece ""Get yer ya ya's out (one of the best live recordings in rock and roll history), it drags itself along some - too many - interviews in which people sitting on a chair talk about some obvious subjects concerning the Rolling Stones in general. The ""top"" comes when a (known?) guitarist shows how to play the riff of ""Satisfaction"" (three notes: guitar course, lesson number one...). In other words: ""some useless information"", according to the lyrics of Satisfaction.  As for the music, you can find there (too) short pieces of live performances taken from some old TV shows, but especially from the DVDs ""The Stones in the park"" (live concert in Hyde Park) and ""Gimme shelter"" (US tour 1969). You better buy them, in addiction to the CD ""Get yer ya ya's out"". Satisfaction guaranteed.",1157673600,2,952,4.987421383647798
8410509,1,B003ZJY2TI,How anyone can give this cheaply made dull-o-rama more than one star is absurd. The producers of this travesty are surely aware that no one who buys this will feel that they got what they paid for. This looks exactly like some college sophomore's video production project. I feel sick.,1151539200,8,285,4.72
8410510,1,B003ZJY2TI,"This is beyond disappointing.  Being a big fan of the Stones and this being one of my favorite albums, my expectations were admittedly high.  Be that as it may be, this DVD is barely about the album or the Stones.  Most of the time the footage is interviews with people standing in front of musical instruments blathering on about the Stones and their signifigance to Rock 'n Roll.  I could even bear that if there were the odd performance or two.  The only time the Stones are on screen are snippets of performances hijacked from Gimme Shelter (the film) or arcane things from European television mostly obscured by copyright information.  Avoid this thing like the plague...",1143763200,15,676,4.7844827586206895
8410511,3,B003ZJY2TI,The quality of the film is good. Interesting interviews. Not enough music. I thought it was the concert.,1142121600,6,104,4.833333333333333
8410512,1,B003ZJY2TI,"""Get Yer Ya Yas Out"" is, simply, the greatest live rock and roll album ever.  And somebody made a DVD ""discussing"" it?  WHY?  I mean, it's like what I read once, ""you can look at the Mona Lisa about 2 inches away if you want to see it 'up close',"" but, no, I'm not a'tall interested in listening to some ""scholar"" ""discuss"" the CD.",1140307200,9,331,4.140625
8410513,1,B003ZJY2TI,"A complete waste of your money. A bunch of Englishmen on very comfortable couches explaining the obvious. This would have been a nice TV show, for an audience who is not familiar with the Stones in 1969. However this DVD will be snapped up by fans, who deserve more than what it has on offer. 10 second snippets of songs, spliced between drawn out commentaries? The song Honky Tonk Women, according to this DVD the high point of the 1969 shows, being interrupted for a commentary that it IS the high point of the show?

Come on, this is a missed opportunity. For any real insight on the Making of GET YER YA YA'S OUT, on the recording, the overdubs (yes!), the bootlegs that run parallel to this great great live Stones album I recommend people visit [...] . And anyway, this DVD captures the tracks from the movie Gimme Shelter more than those from GYYYO. Of course, they are from the same week of shows, but taken from different nights, and therefor the DVD doesn't really coverwhat it claims.

Buy Get Yer Ya Ya's Out (cd) and Gimme Shelter (DVD) instead, and shop for the bootlegs as mentioned on that web page. Another incredibly knowledgable site on this period of the Rolling Stones is [...] and also [...]

I bought the Euro version of this DVD that was already up for sale before the US version, and I could not have been more disappointed. And they should definitely replace the guitar player who ""explains"" Keith's parts. They should find someone who actually has a feel for how Keith played them (there are plenty who actually do).

Steer away from this ripoff.

(This is my first ever negative review, I am so disappointed, this could have been such a landmark documentary if they'd have gotten the right people on it.)",1133136000,73,1732,4.574193548387097
