In this volume, it comes out that Chichay's father, Chito, may be the reason why Joaquin has a bullet in his head. It also carries the most painful scene to watch...the breakup of Joaquin and Chichay. Is this truly the end of Joaquin and Chichay? Has Juliana finally succeeded in separating them once and for all? Will Joaquin die?

Before you skip out on watching these episodes because it carries a super sad moment in the ""Chiquin"" love story, it also contains the ""Best Date Ever"", the date Joaquin has been promising to take Chichay!",1405728000,,734,4.771653543307087
