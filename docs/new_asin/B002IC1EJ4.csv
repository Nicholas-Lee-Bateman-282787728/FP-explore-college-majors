8370796,1,B002IC1EJ4,Very bad quality.  The WIND on the microphone is so loud that you cannot even hear the waves.,1477440000,,93,4.166666666666667
8370797,1,B002IC1EJ4,"Too Much Piano, poorly filmed....Someone set up a Camera on a beach and played the same scene boringly!  OMG Nothing to LOOK at, Nothing to Hear but the same piano with the microphone catching the WIND against it!  Changed scenes FINALLY!  MUSIC did NOT match the SCENE on the next frame!  OH NO, went back to the same old tired scene after 1 minute of hope with some mess of a pitiful folk song sounding background,

So this guy took Piano.  Good for him.  DO Not waste your time or money...this can be picked up in any Thrift Store soon!  I am so ashamed to say I paid way too much money for this!",1470614400,,599,4.192982456140351
8370798,5,B002IC1EJ4,"If you Yoga, if you meditate, if you need to relax, you should get this DVD. The soft sounds of the ocean waves coupled with the soft sounds of Earl Rose on solo piano make you feel like taking off your shoes and sinking them into the soft sand. Of course you would have to supply your own sand, but you get what I mean. I highly recommend this DVD.",1285545600,3,349,4.0

The beautiful ocean is just wonderful! The piano background music is great! What else can I say... A nice addition to anyone who collects meditation videos.",1248739200,4,324,4.701754385964913
