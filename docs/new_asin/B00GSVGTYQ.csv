8627185,2,B00GSVGTYQ,"I know officially this was an anti-apartheid movie, and it was filmed under difficult circumstances, but it was also scripted and the script is plainly put racist in certain parts, and I don't mean showing white racism against black South Africans on screen, which would be the point of the movie, but showing black South Africans in negative stereotypes. Here is an example: the main character gets picked up by the police, and yes there is a white police officer who tries to get close to the wife, but he is prevented by a colleague, but later on another black South African enters her home and tries to rape her and actually ends up killing her. Black South Africans are also shown as shifty eyed, stealing, lying, lazy, drinking, and a woman as easy to be had. Other scenes felt like ""Oh, look at the Natives are doing their stuff!"". I find all of it particularly hard to understand as Rogosin was Jewish and apparently vowed to expose fascism and racism in light of what happened during WWII. How come he repeated the stereotypes about black South Afircans, which he would have found utterly offensive in a Jewish context? I also don't understand how two South African writers could have been part of this script and this is what came out of this collaboration. A missed chance and actually damaging. Maybe it shows how even somebody who thought he was exposing racism was still very much part of its thinking patterns.

The two stars are for effort, for trying and it being better than nothing.",1480809600,,1501,4.664150943396226
