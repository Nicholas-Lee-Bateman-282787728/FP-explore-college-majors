He works such monumental stars as The Nasty Boys, Papa Shangoo, The Beserker...and most dimunitive of them all...SKINNER.  These matches are beyond bad, the same sequence of moves in the same order, Warrior doesn't press slam anyone he just shoulder blocks them with his funny looking outfits on.  He looks terrible, literallyt this video will tarnish your image of him and in turn make you feel stupid for being the kid that was a fan of him at age whatever.  This should be called ""the ultimate embarrassment""",1285027200,,758,4.71969696969697
7828175,1,630263606X,For a guy who cant even say his own promo without stumbling over his own material shouldn't deserve his own video. Bottom line he took the wrestling business and made a joke out of it. If you want a comedy act buy this tape if you want real wrestling buy a ric flair tape,1187395200,,271,4.037037037037037
7828176,5,630263606X,"How can you lose with a tape dedicated solely to the awesomeness that is THE WARRIOR?!?!?

Good luck finding anything Warrior-related on DVD in the future because from what I hear, even the DVD ""The Self Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior"" may be getting pulled from sales due to a lawsuit.  The Warrior owns all things Warrior....and don't you question it!!!

RAAAGGGHHHHH!!!!

This tape is a must have for all Warrior fans, and compliments any Macho Man fan's collection as well.

If you don't buy this tape when given the opportunity, then may the Warrior's ancestors skeletons drudge themselves up from the bloody battlegrounds and rise to the moons of Saturn to form a chain of destruction that will rain down upon your family like the tombstones of our fore-fathers--AAAHHHHHGG!!!!",1185667200,6,788,5.030769230769231

Anyone who remembers Mr. Warrior knows he was a great character but not the best wrestler.  This is an weird tape because all the matches take place before WM VI, meaning Warrior had not yet captured the Heavyweight belt.  In fact, this tape seems to have been made in order to hype his feud with Rick Rude which would later lead to his 2nd Intercontinental Title @ SUMMERSLAM '89.

For nostalgic reasons, the most memorable match here is the 1st one with Honky Tonk Man where Ultimate Warrior snatches the IC title in under a minute.  Most of the matches are pretty lukewarm due to the limited wrestling style.  Haku was later known as ""Meng"" in WCW.  The first bout with Rick Rude includes a ""posing contest"" which has some hilarious announcing from Gorilla Monsoon and Jesse Ventura. The match with Hercules is NOT from WrestleMania IV, its from ""Superstars"" TV and features the two playing tug of war with a chain.  Likewise, its interesting to watch the match against Savage as it predates the classic retirement match @ WM VII.  By interesting I don't mean that its good wrestling, I just mean that REALLY shows how great the WrestleMania match is by comparison.

I don't buy a lot of wrestling merchandise anymore, but if the McMahons wanted $15 of my money then they could release a DVD of Warrior interviews and promos.  This tape and the infamous 'SELF DESTRUCTION' DVD don't have enough of them!  Of course I'm not holding my breath as Honky, Warrior and Savage seem to be part of a small club that is loathed by the WWE brass.  The artist formerly known as Jim Hellwig didn't do much to make friends, but in a parallel universe he could've been at the forefront of a Surrealist literary revival.",1182297600,,2156,4.7272727272727275
