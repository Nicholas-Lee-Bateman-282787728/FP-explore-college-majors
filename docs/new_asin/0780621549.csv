7789638,4,0780621549,"Partisans on either side will not be happy with the portrayal of Ronald Reagan.  Those on the left will feel that Reagan continues to be held up as some sort of demigod, while those on the right will bristle at any criticism of Reagan's ""disengaged"" style of presidential leadership.  I definitely do not fall into the category of a Reagan supporter & I believe the man is sometimes given more credit than he is due for world events that were unfolding long before he assumed the presidency.  Nonetheless, I think that this documentary gives credit where credit is due in regards to Reagan's accomplishments.
In the wake of Reagan's death and the attendent eulogizing, it is important to remember that Reagan's presidency had both its high points & low points, and also that his political record long precedes his occupancy of the White House.
Two main themes run through the documentary:  Reagan's unflagging belief in the greatness of the American nation (and by extension, his belief in his own capacity to restore the US to what he saw as its former greatness), and his dogged opposition to the threat of Communism as he perceived it.  Again and again, the producers return to these themes, sometimes for the better & sometimes for the worse.
On the negative side (for me at least), this tends to reduce Reagan's foreign policy to a rather one-dimensional approach.  Obviously, in this limited format it is impossible to chronicle Reagan's foreign policy day-by-day, but some significant omissions need to be discussed.  Not the least of these would be the bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut, Reagan's response to it, and the subsequent invasion of Grenada (which many people believe was an effort to distract the public from Beirut).  Additionally, the bombing of Tripoli should have been examined to show that Reagan responded to the threat of terrorism in a variety of ways.  One can also point to the overthrow of Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines to demonstrate that Reagan was not uniformly an interventionist.  One would have thought that Marcos, a staunch ally of the US in the Pacific Rim and an opponent of communism, could have successfully appealed to Reagan for military intervention.  Yet, the Reagan administration (to its credit, I believe) did not intervene and let events unfold on their own.
Some critics of this documentary complain that it gives Reagan too little credit for causing the collapse of the Soviet Union.  All I can say to that is that they need to look at the bigger picture, going back to Truman, and realize that the Soviet collapse was a long long time in the making.  Actually, very little discussion is devoted to the USSR collapse, which is probably a good thing.  It has been less than 13 years since the collapse, and the last card has yet to be played in this game.  It needs to be pointed out that the Communist Party in Russia is alive and well --- the legislature is filled with party members, and the Prime Minister is a former member of the KGB.  It is hard to argue that Russian communism has done anything other than change its stripes a bit.  The Cold War may be over (although with China still firmly communist, how can anyone definitively say that?), but it is still too early to tell.  Just remember, the Bourbons in France were out of power from 1791 to 1815 --- 24 years, folks.  It is best to wait another generation before making a true assessment of Reagan's legacy regarding this paricular topic.
Thankfully, this documentary avoids doing that.  However, it is hard to look at this documentary as being particularly definitive for that very reason.  Enough time has not yet passed for us truly to be able to assess Reagan's true legacy.  We should accept this documentary as the best that can be produced until another one comes along --- and I suspect that it will be more than a few years before that happens.",1087430400,8,3883,4.764179104477612
7789639,1,0780621549,"This video deserves 0 stars, and that's what I'd put if it were an option.  Clearly written by a left-winger with an axe to grind.
This video is NOT fair and balanced.  Go elsewhere if you want to see an accurate portrayal of one of our nations greatest Presidents and everything he TRULY accomplished.",981936000,21,302,4.574074074074074
7789640,4,0780621549,"For anyone who is interested in a detailed account of Reagan's life and presidency, this video is suggested. The creators, in my mind, did a good job of portraying Reagan's presidency and his life.  There is ample opportunity for both lovers and haters of Reagan to scream at the television.  Liberals are sure to assert that this video gives Reagan too much credit for the prosperous economy and the end of the Cold War; while conservatives are sure to rail that the video sometimes went out of its way to portray Reagan as an senile dope.  If there was a ideological slant, it was undoubedly to the left. The condesending commentary of Anthony Lewis added absolutely nothing; and strings of amateur psychoanalysis of Reagan by Lou Cannon, Sam Donaldson, and Edmund Morris should have been cut.  Of course, the creators tried to balance critics by including the observations of George Will, Ed Meese, and Mike Deaver (and others) among their docier of Reagan experts.  All in all, it did a good job at giving Reagan credit where due, and condemnation where deserved. If you're looking for a 4 hour disquisition on how wonderful or terrible Reagan was - this video is not for you. If you want a lengthy account of the 1980-88 presidency as it really was, then buy and watch it. It's not perfect. But it's probably about as perfect a video on Ronald Reagan that can be found.",973123200,15,1374,4.6846473029045645
7789641,5,0780621549,"Finally... a tribute that avoids the hero worship of the right and the snooty derision of the left.  Sprinkled with helpful interviews featuring the divergent Reagan family, Reagan White House insiders, and historians,  as well as the international perspective of Margaret Thatcher and Mikhail  Gorbachev, this video kept me enthralled.
The calm, stable voice of  David Ogden Stiers keeps the production on both feet, on solid ground.  The  final moments on the Alzheimer's tragedy will bring a tear even to the  coldest liberal eye.
As a long-time Reagan fan from his hometown of  Dixon, Illinois, I know some of this production will disturb other devoted  Reaganites.  That fact should be a compliment to the producers of this  memorable 4-1/2 hour keepsake.",961718400,8,760,5.198347107438017
7789642,5,0780621549,"This is a great video for those who do not like Ronald Reagan (I feared  and hated him most of the time of his presidency) - because it really  changed a lot in how I think about this president, and helps to understand  a man who ultimately reached the goal most invisible during his presidency  - to end the global threat of a nuclear confrontation between the  superpowers.
