And even on the back of DVD case, it says both The Butterfly Effect and The Butterfly Effect 2 have English subtitles. In reality, the former doesn't provide the subtitles. New Line Home Video studio just conned me, other customers, and sellers. I'll have to return it.",1339804800,4,350,4.754098360655738
3447681,5,B001AGPSCS,The item was brand new still in original packaging just like it was supposed to be and an all around fantastic set of movies,1338163200,,124,4.208333333333333
3447682,4,B001AGPSCS,"After reviewing ""The Butterfly Effect Collection"", I must admit that I enjoyed the second story more than the initial film.  I thought that there were too many possible scenarios in the first film.  In my opinion, it was sort of confusing to me.  I had to watch the Butterfly Effect about three times before I ""got it"".  And, I thought that the presence of Actor Ashton Kutcher would make the film more specious; but, it didn't.  I wasn't bored watching this movie.  But, I couldn't wait for it to end.  Whereas, The Butterfly Effect 2 was interesting and amusing.  Again, the film presented different scenarios of an event; but, the director didn't overdo it .  It was enjoyable.  Therefore, I'm glad I purchased ""The Butterfly Effect Collection"".",1333497600,2,748,4.818897637795276
3447703,5,B001AGPSCS,"I love Butterfly Effect 1.  I had it on DVD but it got scratched so I replaced it with this.  Can't beat the price!
I will say that I didn't think Butterfly Effect 2 was very good, but having it included was just a bonus in my mind anyway.",1433462400,,239,3.857142857142857

3447706,5,B001AGPSCS,THIS A VERY EMOTINALY GRIPPING MOVIES. JUST WHEN YOU THINK THAT THINGS COULD NOT GET ANY WORSE FOR THE HERO. THEY DO.,1395792000,,117,4.363636363636363
3447707,5,B001AGPSCS,"Not huge on the second one, but if you have some time to waste, it's an interesting sequel. I only bought the Collection because I knew I loved the first one and I was curious about the second one. It's kind of like if you loved Donnie Darko and decided to watch S. Darko.... Not a complete waste of time, but it's nothing special really.

Anyways, if you're just looking to get a physical copy of Butterfly Effect, this is a great buy; if you're curious about the second one, it's a good price; and if you've never seen either of them before, just buy it. Now.",1391731200,3,561,4.242990654205608

3447709,5,B001AGPSCS,The first Butterfly Effect is a great movie. I've actually never seen the second. I would have liked to see a couple more behind the scenes features.,1365033600,,149,4.555555555555555
3447710,5,B001AGPSCS,I had no idea that this movie had so much scary stuff and scared me a little. Just a little.,1362614400,,92,3.65
3447711,3,B001AGPSCS,"Ashton Kutcher and Amy Smart's best performances are showcased in The Butterfly Effect. Kutcher's talent has been squandered most of his career. He played a moron in That 70's Show so long that people are afraid to give him a shot at a real role. I wasn't a fan of him before, but this movie is incredible.

The Butterfly Effect is an exciting, suspense-filled, emotion-driven movie with occassional laughs and a unique premise. All around one of the greater products of Hollywood. You care about the lives of each character, and as the story unfolds, you fall more in love with them without being bored.

BE2 has nothing to do with the first one. The main protagonist begins suffering migraines one day accompanied with a bloody nose (which by the way is done so poorly you can actually SEE the actor wiping the blood from his hand TO his nose for the ""effect""). Sometimes after a migraine he will randomly be ""poofed"" into the past to an uneventful and pointless time in his life.
The acting is atrocious. There's no plot or character development. 35-40 somethings are playing youthful 25 year-olds (and BADLY). I won't spoil it for you, but if you watch it you will too ask yourself, ""WTF, that baby makes no sense."" It doesn't fit in any of the other future events and its unnecessary. It's like at the last minute during filming the director's wife brought their child to the filming location and said ""OH, OH, PUT OUR SON IN THE SHOT!""
I have seen far better, lower-budgeted films. It's boring as all hell. In fact, it was SO bad that my boyfriend and I started playing Magic: The Gathering while it was playing in the background (he won :( ). The were 2 times BE2 bad my undivided attention: the sex scenes. The were good. So good in fact, I'm convinced that this director shot pornos prior to this. Yeah. He should stick to that.

Buy the Butterfly Effect. If you want both cheap then just fast-forward BE2 to those scenes. Life's too short to spend it on bad movies. Hey, atleast I got it used at a low dirt price.",1356998400,4,2023,4.521857923497268
3447712,5,B001AGPSCS,"Some of us actually think about this kind of thing: the Chaos Theory. Recommend the 1st one,,,interesting, well put together. the 2nd one, well, pretty much of a flop! same idea as the 1st but no where near as good,,,acting, directing, writing, everything in general a VERY big disappointment! the price is good; watch the 1st, discard part 2!!!",1347235200,,345,4.864406779661017
8277315,4,B001AGPSCS,"Interesting concept. Good to see how minor choices can impact lives dramatically (for good or bad). Second movie has completely different characters. The only real connection between #1 and #2  is how the characters get ""in"" and ""out"" of various timelines.",1519430400,,256,5.2439024390243905

8277323,5,B001AGPSCS,"The reason i gave this 5* stars is because i like the first movie alot,but i wound up getting this twin pack for the exact same price as the single. I thought that part 1 was well crafted with an excrllent performance from Ashton Kutcher,Amy Smart & Ethan Suplee. However the 2nd film is atrocious ! There really is no story or explanation as to why this guy has these abilities(unlike part 1 where it is all explained) but part 2 is just ridiculous. The guy got in a car crash but now he can jump into the past by looking into pictures. I give part 1 5 stars but part 2 gets 1 star.
I just bought it to get 2 films for the price of 1 but only 1 was worth it. Part 1 is fantastic,but if you wanna give part 2 a shot for the same price get it. But be warned it is terrible.",1444953600,3,772,3.892405063291139
