SYNOPSES for ""Sci-Fi Classics, V.6""--

THE INCREDIBLE PETRIFIED WORLD--  Four explorers have the adventure of their lives when the cable on their diving bell breaks and they plummet to the ocean's bottom. There, they find underwater caverns and within them, a man who was shipwrecked 14 years earlier! He shows the crew an oxygen-producing volcanic vent that's kept him alive. The director of this ludricrous story, Jerry Warren, can be briefly seen as the plane passenger sitting behind John Carradine.

THE PHANTOM CREEPS--  1939 serial edited a decade later for television. Bela Lugosi is the mad scientist out to rule the world with his many inventions, such as an invisibility belt and an 8-foot tall robot. His efforts are opposed by the US Government, as well as several foreign spies. Dorothy Arnold (who plays the girl reporter), was Joe DiMaggio's first wife.

ROCKETSHIP--  Another serial re-edited and condensed. This first Flash Gordon effort is by far the best. After defeating a sea monster, Flash takes on Ming the Merciless, the declared ruler of Planet Mongo. Lots of action, spaceship battles, flimsy costumes, bizarre sets and wacky gadgetry.

WARNING FROM SPACE--  One of the lesser efforts from Japan's science fiction golden age. An alien takes on human form to warn that Earth is on a collision course with a runaway planetoid. In an effort to destroy the approaching orb, a scientist creates an energy source that can be converted into the most powerful bomb of all time. Before he finishes his work, the scientist is kidnapped by enemy agents who want this weapon for their own purposes.
