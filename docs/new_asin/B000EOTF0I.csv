8112330,5,B000EOTF0I,"This is the great way to keep up your flexibility, especially when you can make dance classes due to heavy work schedules and school.. I highly recommend to dancers and non-dancers. It's a great way to stay  in shape.",1403481600,,217,4.564102564102564
8112331,3,B000EOTF0I,I probably won't get the results that I want. Go ahead & read the other reviews. They're accurate & I feel no need to repeat.,1361836800,,125,4.04
8112332,5,B000EOTF0I,"I'm not a dancer, but I don't agree with another review that said this DVD isn't good for average viewers. I found this DVD extremely easy to follow. The instructor explains every stretch before the workout segment starts. In this explanation it's very easy to see what the instructor is doing. Now, I will admit I only did the upper body segment so far, but it really stretched everything. I used to have a tight neck/shoulders and it feels much better now. I watched the instruction for the lower body and it's easy to understand too. Just haven't done it yet. (I'm not looking to be as flexible as a dancer but just to stretch as much as I can for health. I think this is the goal of most viewers.) I'm not sure if I made it clear but you know the stretches before the workout segment starts so you just follow along with the timing and reps. If you started with the workout segment, you would be lost.",1348617600,,905,4.329411764705882
8112333,3,B000EOTF0I,"Let me begin this review by saying that just from watching the video, Michle Assaf is very qualified to be an instructor- she can do all the exercises smoothly as well as being extremely flexible. In my review, I am in no way undermining her as a instructor because I do believe that she is a great instructor.

However saying this I have to critique this from a home viewers perspective as most people I believe who would be considering buying this video either can't make classes or want to find a video that they can do comfortably from their own home without the assistance of an instructor.

Coming from a non dancing background but have watched/used several exercise videos, I did have expectations which included: The instructors skill, ease of understanding the exercise with different angles provided or demonstrated on another student and the exercise actually working.

Well from my first paragraph the instructor does have sufficient (if not top notch skills) however the ease of understanding the exercise is where this video starts to lose points. Also I have to add that I also bought Active-Isolated Strength Program also by Michele Assaf (which was a far superior ""exercise video"" compared to this"") and I had feeling that this flexibility video was one her first exercise videos. Mostly because you can't see the angles correctly in order to do the stretch. Most of the time it's just a close up of her or her body part in a 2D format so you can't see the other side to gain a real understanding of the stretch. At the end as per kimberly Hahn's review below, there is a class at the end where there's a bunch of people doing the stretches and then you see the students being helped by other instructors - if they can't do it right then how can ""at home viewers"" get it right. Of course I don't expect that everyone will do it right the first time at home however I do have an expectation that the home viewers will ""see"" enough of the exercise to be able to do it properly without assistance.  If you are a beginner to exercise videos- I don't think this will be the best first ""instructional"" exercise video for you - unless you want to persevere which I do think is possible!

As for the flexibility exercises - I can see this is a great set of exercises that increase flexibility safely - there is no tugging or trying to exert a stretch that is impossible. The technique is to hold the stretch for two exhale breaths and then release and then repeat 8-10 repetitions. Eventually the stretch's intensity is increased by a rope - and once again Michele does stress to use your muscle to stretch and not the rope to yank on your body part. I have been following the stretches daily and have seen an improvement. Coming from a non dancer background and this was for a dancer - I thought that they would show specific exercises - where they would say if you want to do the splits - do these exercises - if you want to be able to do a bend back (for example) then do these exercises rather than - this stretch will stretch your hamstring - which I know what my hamstring is but don't know what ""flexibility move"" it'll help me for. AND the last comment I have to say (and I know this sounds silly) but one of the added reasons as to why I bought this was because I thought this video would teach me how to be flexible in the back so I could do that move from the picture on the front of the DVD - which it doesn't! I was a bit disappointed.

Overall - great for dancers looking for another way to safely stretch they're already stretched limbs and KEEP their flexibility. As for beginners/non dancers looking to be as flexible as dancers - keep looking.",1187740800,7,3670,4.4538690476190474
8112334,3,B000EOTF0I,"Kimberly Hahn wrote a great review I agree with 100%. I am not a dancer by any means, but usually I can do a russian split on a good day, have been doing yoga for over 5 years & rented this in hopes of increasing my flexibility.

Michelle teaches you the stretches for about 30 min on a physical/massage table. It is chaptered by muscles & it is taught straight-forward, dry scientifically with medical terminology. She uses analogies to help, but unfortunately there is only one camera angle & sometimes it's hard to read the angle of the stretch. Also, in the teaching segment, only one side is taught (both sides are done in the later class chapter.) The legs are first & almost all require a strap or rope that can always twist the foot medially/laterally in/out while pulling the straight leg toward your head. The legs, feet & toes stretches are the bulk of the streteches as well as  a single stretch for major areas of the chest, rotator cuff, shoulders, arms & neck.

Some stretches I have never seen before, some everyone knows such as assisting your bent arm slightly behind your shoulder to stretch your triceps.

After that 30 min, all stretches are shown for 10 min in a gym with mirror with about 6 other people besides Michelle. The camera is far away to show everyone & it's all one shot/angle.

Since Michelle is very flexible, you will see the leg be stretched further then almost any fitness dvd you've seen. Since positioning of feet is important when stretching the legs, I agree with Kimberly you should have great body awareness or be guided in person to avoid injury. There is great potential to overdo it just be somewhat in the realm of the flexibility Michelle shows.

I took off 2 stars for lack of camera angles, boring music, stiffness of the routine & I was expecting more secrets or unknown stretches. I kept the 3 stars since considering the boring take on the stretches, she went as fast as possible knowing it could be boring, she didn't go off topic, no story telling & kept to the point & kept to the target of the dvd.",1176508800,11,2057,4.516129032258065
8112335,5,B000EOTF0I,"This is an excellent video of how to be flexible, using real people.  The teacher's flexibility is amazing, such as a hamstring stretch with her leg stretched all the way up to her head on the floor.  She says that if you stretch every day, you can do this too.  The video is a good tool to help a person find this inner flexibility with many useful and easy to follow exercises.  It is very positive and motivational as well.",1174521600,5,426,4.2875
8112336,3,B000EOTF0I,"I have been a dancer for as long as i can remember and Im always trying to find new ways to better myself. I bought this DVD to gain flexibility as the title suggests and I do feel that the tape has helped me to do this. However, I don't believe that I would be able to execute the exercises in this film had I not been a dancer. The terminology that Michelle uses is not explained and the ""take the class"" section moves far to quickly for an inexperienced audience. I had to watch it several times before I could keep up with the pace. Even the students on the DVD seem confused at times and are not in sync with Michelle. Furthermore, I don't believe that the stretches can be done properly without some type of guidance as the muscles DO NOT stretch correctly without very procise postioning of the limbs. I perform this routine daily and I have gained excellent strength and flexibility because of it, I just think that perhaps Michelle could have gone into further detail in regards to the stretching for a less familiar viewing demographic.",1156204800,47,1046,4.453125
