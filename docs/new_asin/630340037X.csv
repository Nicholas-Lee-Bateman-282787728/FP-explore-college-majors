7847077,1,630340037X,Too many shots of stain glassed windows and paintings. The majority of the script is spent on telling the gospel rather than explaining the sites. The voices of the heavily reverbed actors are only outdone by the painfully bad synthesizer score. This is VERY poorly produced which is unfortunate. I love documentaries on the holy land. National Geographic's tape on Jerusalem is infinitely better.,1009756800,2,397,5.21875
