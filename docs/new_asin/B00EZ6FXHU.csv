5958166,5,B00EZ6FXHU,I researched mostly all belly dancing videos on Amazon for a beginners. I found that this particular dvd suit my preference. Great detailed instructions. Irena covers a lot of techniques to become an Intermediate dancer. There are several  dance along after you learned the basic moves.,1402790400,5,286,5.217391304347826
5958167,5,B00EZ6FXHU,This is the best start dvd i love it. The best break down ive seen. i have both her dvds and i love them,1401148800,3,104,3.375
5958168,5,B00EZ6FXHU,loved easy to follow lost of directions and explanations.  Irina is an awesome teacher & dancer her self! Great buy!,1400544000,3,116,4.8
5958169,5,B00EZ6FXHU,"Amazing DVD!  I am a complete bellydance beginner and find this DVD to be extremely helpful.  And I'm only on the first disc, there is so much to learn but she breaks it down so that you can understand each move and practice it slowly before you move on to actually doing full on dances.  Highly recommended!",1397520000,9,308,4.368421052631579
5958170,5,B00EZ6FXHU,"Im a novice. As in I dance at home to DVDs and don't consider myself a real dancer. I bellydance to enjoy myself as woman. That's being said I still want good instruction, variety and to have fun. I've bought several of Neons DVDs and I like them. I bought Asharah and Ariella DVDs also and they have great drills. To me this was a mix in between. I loved that she Irina has belly rolls and head slides somethings I had been missing on. I love the second DVD practice section. I've been dancing at home for a year and know that basic moves so after reviewing them once I went to disk two. I love her warmup it almost feels as though your dancing. Very enjoyable. My only beef is well I thought there would be more than one performance!! The promo shows her dancing I the outfit she wears on the cover and I haven't seen that. But maybe I'm wrong. All in all for me and the at home dancer this is fun, eyecandy,and good practice.",1394928000,6,928,4.161111111111111
5958171,4,B00EZ6FXHU,"I think it's great but I wouldn't say it's for the absolute beginner because it's not broken down to ""diamond cut precision."" However I enjoy the drills on the second disk but she does go fast.",1394064000,4,193,4.388888888888889
5958172,5,B00EZ6FXHU,"I'm very pleased with Irina's new practice DVD!

To address the criticism of the intermediate bellydancer who claimed this DVD was lacking in detailed instruction and who recommended a number of other DVD's instead; I own & have used 2 of her recommendations: Jenna's ""Basics & Beyond"" & Auttumn's ""Beautiful Bellydance Technique"". I can say that, yes, these DVD's have excellent instruction and are very good DVD's to help new dancers get off to a tidy start in BD as well as being useful to help more experienced dancers fine tune & correct their technique. That said, these DVD's are not the types you want to work with daily for weeks or months on end...they're meant to teach you the skills you need but aren't really well suited to be used so repeatedly...more like for the occasional review & recorrection of technique.

Irina's Diamond Cut Bellydance is wonderful to use to continue on forward from those other DVD's, once you have the basics addressed and understood, start using Irina's DVD to practice & bask in the pleasure of these movements. Let me also state that, while Diamond Cut Bellydance might not be the most detailed in discussing BD technique, it's also not lacking in helpful information either...I found LOTS of helpful guidence in it! Irina has a beautiful selection of music, often times hypnotic when drilling the movements in slo-mo. I am one of those dancers who carries so much tension in her body all day long that it's difficult to remember to relax my body & facial muscles when I get into my home dance practice...which isn't good for creating healthy flowing movement. With how Irina's first practice section is done I find it very easy to melt into the movements with plenty of mental ""space"" to dedicate to reminding myself to relax (faster moving DVD's make that difficult and the more you practice without relaxing the worse your bad dance habbits & tension-riddled movement get...DVD's like this one help you build good habbits to use later in the faster moving practices). I easily set my mind to the ""calm"" setting in this practice and it made a HUGE difference in my resulting dance isolations & flow. Often, she slows you down and has you hold the movements at the point of maximum engagement, building & strengthening those very necessary muscles. The warm up is very good, thorough without being so long that you feel like you've finished your ""workout"" before the actual practice has begun.

I haven't attempted anything on the second DVD yet. I looked it over and it looks great. For now, however, I'm content to keep working with the material on  the first disc, strengthening and refining my technique...& simply enjoying the luxuriousness of the movements in slow motion :). My dancing is feeling easier everyday since working with this DVD & I've awarded it a place of honor in my over-stocked DVD collection, right next to Sarah Skinners Shimmy Workout DVD, as a video I will use ALLOT in coming months :D. I will still review Autumn's & Jenna's DVD's from time to time, but Diamond Cut bellydance is my go-to for daily skill building.

THANKS IRINA!!",1390867200,43,3106,4.8198874296435275
5958173,5,B00EZ6FXHU,"Irina  brings forth a jewel in her double dvd, Diamond Cut, an instructional technique program for beginners. Belly dance is most beautiful when it is executed precisely, just as a diamond is precisely cut so that all facets come thru. As you enter this multi faceted program, you may soon become enchanted by all the variety it has to offer.
Before the movement breakdown begins, Irina speaks directly to the viewer defining her program.

Isolation technique with varied traveling steps and foot positions are a great feature to begin with. There is no drill repetition and the segments are short however, if you are patient it will all come together in DVD 2.

The warm up section follows with intensity and works everything from wrists to ankles, with deep lunges, shoulder rolls, torso rotations and extensions; arm sways, hamstrings stretches, knee rotations all the more to prepare the body for the technique section.

Posture is next and most important since it is the foundation in which to build the dance. Lower body isolations are demonstrated next in varied tempos and arms patterns. These begin with hip slides and from these evolve hip twists, hip lifts.
Irina demonstrates upper body isolations beautifully working the chest from side to side, then front to back, in completion to form a chest circle.

Shoulder isolations include sensual shoulder rolls layered on plies all set to beautiful background music along with shoulder shimmies performed beautifully while changing levels. The technique continues with snake arms layered on torso sways and follows with hand and finger rotations and undulations to further embellish the dance.

Stomach undulations are broken down simply from upper to lower abdominal isolations. Irina explains very well to divide the belly in two sections and before this, an exercise contracting the entire belly to define the process of the belly roll.
The technique section continues with Irina demonstrating upper and lower body undulations, forward and reverse. A very detailed section on hip circles comes next with technique defining small and large circles, interior and exterior, followed by the omi interior circle.

Figure of 8's continue the hip work, beginning with vertical mayas, and reversed vertically to create hip sways. Horizontal figure of 8's
Single hip work circles in two different variations which are lovely and sensual movements.
Working with the feet section includes changes in directions, traveling steps as chasse, hip lift steps, hips twists, full body traveling undulations and choo choo shimmy.

DVD 2 Is a comprehensive overview of previous movements and then some.  There is an abundance of material to learn and practice in this section as the combinations evolve into seven fluid and percussive movement from elements in previous sections. Irina beautifully dances and breaks down the sections of combination movement for the choreographies.
I simply love this program and all that the variety that it features. In my opinion each element is represented with all the integrity that belly dance deserves. My only complaint is that I cannot find a music only option to better practice with. Continuous, precise, practice for me finds that voice overs can become a bit distracting.
Regardless, Irina is elegant in movement, delightful to watch and very easy to learn from. It has been difficult to move away from this program and definitely a perfect foundation for a beginner.",1387497600,19,3455,5.222021660649819
5958174,3,B00EZ6FXHU,"Firstly the good - Irina is a very beautiful dancer and watching her dance is sheer pleasure.

I am an intermediate dancer who has had about a years break from dancing so have gone back to square one to build on good technique and refresh my muscle memory.  I own over 100 DVDs and have had ""live"" instruction classes.

The first of the DVD is to teach technique.  This is where in my opinion it all falls down.  Well filmed, pleasant to watch yet the explanation of the moves - which muscles or skeletal part leads is very lean on some.  You can see - if you know good technique that she is doing them well, but the explanation for new dancers is lacking and I could see a real beginner developing less than precision technique if following the instructions alone.

The type of teaching DVD that gives precision and wonderful nitty gritty technique are Autumn Ward, Hannan Sultan and Jenna (Basics and beyond), and there are a few others like Ranya Renee ...

Second DVD - has combos and drills which are refreshing and great - love this one.

So I would have loved to give this more and feel its overall a nice DVD for a Beginner level (not ablsolute new beginner), but don't think that you would gain ""precision technique"" from it :-)",1382486400,26,1237,4.438053097345133
5958175,5,B00EZ6FXHU,"The long awaited Irina DVD has made it to the market.i just received this DVD in the mail, and could not wait to see it. i have been dancing seriously (pass the gym belly dance) for a year and 1/2. I love this DVD. it is targeted for beginners, but those with a little more experience will benifit from it. The instruction and moves are easy to follow. i got one for my daughter too who is interested. It is great if you are just starting out. It is great for us who want to review certain steps, and work on much need drills to perfect our art. she break it down and make it easy to follow. she moves with such grace and ease. It is a beautifully made DVD. i have seen her perform live and have been lucky enough to have study under her teaching. If you are ever able to take a class or workshop with Irina do it you will not be disappointed, until then enjoy the DVD",1381363200,23,868,4.023121387283237

5958177,5,B00EZ6FXHU,"The instructions on isolations are excellent, and more comprehensive than other instruction I've tried, with the exception of Ariellah's Contemporary Belly Dance and Yoga, which is also excellent. Irina spends more time on the arms, hands, and wrists than one often finds; and she doesn't skimp on the rest of it, either. This DVD has a standing warmup, which I find quite useful when I don't have time to clear the floor and roll out my yoga mat. It's also a very comprehensive warmup, just right for getting me loosened up for my workday, which involves a fair amount of physical labor. Her isolations section is also now a part of my daily self-care regimen, because I have found that, if I am able to isolate my (shoulders, hips, abdomen, ribcage, head, arms, hands), I have far less trouble with what I fear is incipient arthritis.",1476748800,13,836,4.732876712328767

I'm still not brave enough to delve into the dance sequences, but I have watched them all and they are beautiful, useing all the earlier movements in new combinations.  I look forward to learning the choreography soon.  In the meantime,  Irina is a lovely dancer--I enjoy watching her grace, whether I am joining in or not!",1469577600,2,518,4.896551724137931

5958181,3,B00EZ6FXHU,"This is an excellent demonstration of the moves, but it is stringent - one doesn't get a feel for the effect of the moves on the fabrics of the costumes.  I'm looking for a teaching and practice DVD.  That would involve some long stretches of rhythmic music that would become boring if you're looking for a show or demonstration.  Practice requires being able to repeat the same steps or series of steps at the same meter, something teachers can't get nowadays without having to keep running back to the CD player to restart the music.  Jamila Salimpour provided a phenomenal ""endless loop"" cassette tape, with ""Adana"" on one side and ""Salem Allay"" on the other.  This is the only piece of practical practice music I have.  I bought it in the late 1970's, and I don't know how much longer it will last.  What we need is a DVD which would not only provided the extended play music at the same speed, but would provide the visual instruction to go with it.  Constant verbalization would not be necessary.",1459382400,2,1002,4.589887640449438

5958184,5,B00EZ6FXHU,"So far the best belly dance instructional video we've tried. Friends and I are meeting at my house 2x a week to do yoga and dance together.  We couldn't find a live class that we could all schedule or even travel to in any kind of reasonable time.  Irina's teaching style is clear, personal, and accurate. Honestly, this is better than most of the in-person belly dance classes I've taken over the years.  Only one teacher was as good as Irina and that one required me to drive an hour every Saturday morning.  Also, just an fyi,  I'm an 'advanced beginner' and my friends are all absolute beginners.  They kept asking me - ha ha - to teach them. :)",1452902400,3,649,4.366666666666666

5958188,5,B00EZ6FXHU,"This DVD is a drilling DVD for beginners, not an instructional DVD, what the title ""Precision technique & practice"" might make you think. It's also not for total beginners, since the basic bellydance moves and isolations are not broken down in full detail. I think Irina targeted people with some previous general basic bellydance instruction, so she does not explain the movements that you can easily find in other Bellydance beginner DVD's. However, Irina goes into great detail when she breaks down some moves or even ""nuances"" of moves that she considers will make you achieve a ""diamond cut"" style, for example her explanation and drills on ""hand circles"" and ""hand waves"". If you think about it, the hand circle is only a tiny part of a more complex move which is an ""arm trajectory"", which she does not explain (the best explanation and practice of arm trajectories I have seen is included in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bellydance-Beautiful-Technique-from-Step-One-with-Autumn-Ward-Beginner-belly-dancing-classes-Belly-dance-how-to-Beginner-bellydance-instruction/dp/B001L9UG6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bellydance: Beautiful Technique from Step One, with Autumn Ward: Beginner belly dancing classes, Belly dance how-to, Beginner bellydance instruction</a>, closely followed by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Foundations-of-Bellydance-East-Coast-Tribal-with-Sera-Solstice-Beginner-belly-dance-classes-Full-instruction-East-Coast-Tribal-Style-how-to/dp/B00095VJTC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Foundations of Bellydance: East Coast Tribal, with Sera Solstice: Beginner belly dance classes, Full instruction, East Coast Tribal Style how-to</a>). The ""hand waves"" are used when you kind of ""shape"" your body from top to bottom. This movement is used a lot in classic or oriental bellydance; but since it seems quite easy, it is never explained in detail. By focusing on the hand articulations,  which in fact are the beginning or ending of the arm movement, you can improve the ""look"" of your arm movements (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bellydance-Pop-Lock-Tribal-Fusion-Hip-Hop-with-Elisheva-Belly-dancing-classes-Tribal-fusion-belly-dance-instruction-Hip-hop-belly-dance-fusion-how-to/dp/B001LKK6WA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bellydance Pop & Lock - Tribal Fusion Hip-Hop with Elisheva: Belly dancing classes, Tribal fusion belly dance instruction, Hip-hop belly dance fusion how-to</a>&nbsp;also has an excellent segment dedicated to hand articulation exercises).  I don't know why, but I make a distinction between dancers who just ""bellydance"" and dancers who also master beautiful hand movements, for me it makes a difference. It's tiny details that matter in creating that ""diamond cut"" style, so if you care to achieve this and are not only looking to dance as a form of exercise, then this DVD is for you. Although I have to say that my wrists hurt after all the time at the computer and with these hand exercises my articulations feel better, exercising is not only ""abs, glutes and legs...""

This DVD is totally different from her previous DVD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Tribal-Fusion-Belly-Dance-Workout-with-Irina-A-bellydance-fitness-class-of-100-tribal-fusion-style-moves-Includes-complete-belly-dance-instructional-how-to/dp/B00095MBQ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Tribal Fusion Belly Dance Workout, with Irina: A bellydance fitness class of 100% tribal fusion style moves. Includes complete belly dance instructional how-to</a>&nbsp;since this is not a dance workout, where you are immediately immersed in a kind of workout choreography and where you start layering movements from the beginning. Instead you drill a lot of individual moves to music but without layering, which is easier for beginners; but then, instead of combinations in a workout format, where you repeat the same move several times in each combination, in this DVD you will find smaller pieces of dance flows without repeating movements inside them. The last dance flow is a full drum solo choreography, which is way more difficult for beginners than her workout. So basically you can grow your dance with both her DVD's. They share Irina's beautiful, elegant and gracious style, her emphasis on drilling, her sassy combinations that are modern and classic at the same time and the care with which she selects the music. I would buy this one first though and if I had to choose, which I gladly do not have to, I would choose this one, I am using it far more often than the other one.

CARDIO CHALLENGE: Low TONING: Low CHOREOGRAPHY DIFFICULTY: Beginner to Intermediate INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY: Very good for specific details, not too deep for general bellydance moves MUSIC: Excellent FUN FACTOR: Excellent, considering these are drills

CONTENTS:
1) WARM-UP: Excellent warm-up, one of the best in my collection, kind of ""dancy"" from the beginning, not a yoga conditioning warm-up like in her workout DVD.
2) FOUNDATIONS OF BELLYDANCE MOVEMENT: (1 1/4 hours) I consider this more a drilling session than a tutorial. In this section you will review and practice with excellent music almost any basic bellydance move you can think of plus other moves you did not think of, like head slides and hand articulation moves, as well as several travel steps. The moves are not broken down in detail. You get ""just enough"" practice time for each move. Other drilling DVD's let you drill each move longer, which is good to really build your muscle memory but fewer moves are covered and it can get boring. Not with Irina, the music selection and a special kind of ""flair"" that she puts into every move, makes the drilling actually fun, you feel as if you're almost dancing.
3) SIMILAR AND CONTRASTING MOVEMENT PATTERNS: (1/2 hour) This is also a drilling section with excellent music but you combine two similar moves or two contrasting moves together in each segment, like for example an Egyptian hip sway together with a tribal taxeem, a piston hip with a regular hip lift, a hip drop and a hip lift or a chest lift and a chest drop. These combinations emphasize the differences between the moves so that you better understand them and learn to transition between them, but they also look good on their own, because they bring kind of a contrast to your dance.
4) DANCE SEQUENCES: Seven dance combinations put everything you have drilled so far to practice. Each varies in length, style and difficulty level. I have only done this section once and found the combinations beautiful but a bit difficult to follow, specially the last piece, which is a complete drum solo. The combinations do not have much layering, the moves are fairly simple for an advanced beginner; the complexity lies in executing the sequences of movements that do not repeat themselves, like in workout formats. But this is my Achiles heel... I can't deal with real choreos.
5) PERFORMANCE - What can I say, it's simply beautiful and it is composed of several of the moves you've drilled here, but executed with diamond cut style.

This DVD set is conceived with a similar idea than Autumn's set; both sets dedicate the first DVD to introduce the beginner to bellydance and the second one to actually dance small dance flows of varying difficulty. However, both have different approaches: Autumn explains in detail and breaks down the moves and then moves on to dancing without drilling, whereas Irina drills and practices with little explanation and then moves on to dancing. Not everyone learns the same way, some need the detailed break down, some say that the best learning occurs while dancing right away, while still others prefer to drill individual moves before attempting to dance. In my case I need both the break down and the drills, so for me both sets lack one significant part to be complete for total beginners.

EXCELLENT BD DVD'S FOR TOTAL BEGINNERS. I may have other beginner DVD's, but the following are my top pics because all include a detailed tutorial section that break down the moves slowly and without music. Of course tutorials are boring, specially if you are not totally new to BD or if you prefer to learn by dancing from the very first step. However, if you are an absolute beginner in BD, you probably need this instruction, since you need to isolate a lot of muscles you did not even know you could voluntarily move.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Belly-Dance-Basics-Beyond-with-Jenna-Belly-Dancing-Classes-for-a-Solid-Foundation-Bellydance-how-to-belly-dance-technique/dp/B000FSL8WQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Belly Dance Basics & Beyond, with Jenna: Belly Dancing Classes for a Solid Foundation - Bellydance how-to, belly dance technique</a>&nbsp;will provide you one of the most detailed technique sections you will find and probably the most complete one in terms of variety of moves. Jenna explains almost every shoulder/rib/hip move & footstep I have seen so far. Additionally, she practices each move together with you, giving you hints and tips during the practice, so you practice with constant reminders as if you were in a class.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Potion-The-Bellydance-Workout/dp/B001TZ70DU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love Potion - The Bellydance Workout</a>&nbsp;by Neon gives you a good all round beginner tutorial plus a 50 min. beginner dance flow and a 50 min. workout, which is a bit tougher, so you can continue to use this DVD once you improve your skills.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Belly-By-Sandra-Vol-1-Isolations-Bellydance-Instructional/dp/B001SFT764/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Belly By Sandra Vol 1: Isolations (Bellydance Instructional)</a>&nbsp;is also excellent for beginners. Sandra first explains each move, including muscular engagement, posture, etc. without music and also giving you truly interesting background information as to how the move is executed in ""Middle Eastern Dance"" vs other dance forms like ""African"", ""Jazz"", etc. Then she drills each move with excellent drum music, making your drilling much more fun so you do not get bored so easily. However, you would need to buy Vol 1 and 2 and still don't get as many moves as with Jenna.

MUSIC:
Excellent and varied music throughout the DVD, some songs have lyrics and the styles go from oriental pop music to more classic bellydance songs. Each piece fits perfectly with the drill you are doing and it shows Irina selected each piece with care. Since each drill has different music, you will like some more and some less, but you practice to different speeds and you do not get bored.

EMPHASIS:
Good overall emphasis, upper body, lower body, abs, travel steps and nice head & arm movements too. I would say the emphasis is on drilling paying attention to special details and nuances.

WHAT IS BETTER THAN IN OTHER DVD'S:
+ Dance combinations: the dance looks elegant and graceful and is not too complicated. I love how Irina combines slow curvy movements with percussive accents.
+ Excellent music, probably the best in my collection. I thoroughly enjoy drilling to this music, even the slow music isn't cheesy. I usually don't like slow music, but in this DVD I love it and I really feel that when drilling slowly I get a ""deeper"" exercise.
+ FUN: This is probably as fun as drills can get, because you drill to beautiful music and just the right amount of time for each drill before moving on to the next movement drill. This has become my favorite drilling DVD, one that I truly enjoy.
+ Similar and contrasting movement patterns section. Combining and comparing two similar or contrasting moves is helpful in perfecting your technique, as well as beautiful and fun to execute
+ Detailed explanation and practice for specific movements, like hand articulation movements and head slides.
+ Excellent perfect-lenght warm-up and thorough",1426118400,13,12056,5.779403489026449

Nevertheless, if you are an advanced beginner, this technique can be a way to refresh your memory and improve your technique.
In second DVD, there are 21 drills in which you can practice two similar movements. If you are a beginner, this will be a challenge. An the last part of the DVD, Irina breaks down seven combinations. Personally, I love this part, but I think the practice part of the combos are short  and, as a beginner, I would prefer a few more repetitions.

starting out the warm up is great! But the 36 ""basic"" steps are either WAY to detailed or one simple word to sum up what you need to do... every so often ONE step is easy to follow,

for example:
simple Hand circle: 8+ flipping things to remember just to move my hand in a circle?! this dvd makes me over think the move!!!
a full body undulation:her only real guidance is ""contract your abs"" and she only gives you maybe five tries before we move on to something else?

On the hard candy outwork dvd by neon she broke it down into simple steps to follow and spent some time with it , this dvd was just ""Lift"" and on to the next dance move... in point, i find this very hard to follow, simple steps are broken down Way to much to the point am over thinking the movement and fail or not enough and am lost!

Not saying go out and buy the ""hard candy DVD by neon"" but THAT DVD isn't even made for Beginners yet has way more guidance!

DVD 2: is better, but not perfect! doesn't go over any of the moments (if you don't remember from dvd 1 your not going to get it in DVD 2)

Neon dvd there is a ""basic tutorial"" which breaks down the steps then ""practice flow"" you use what you learned slowly and make the movements with music along with voice cues then lastly ""belly dance workout"" which you choose if you want voice cues

Yeah this dvd is nothing like that its ""Remember all 37 steps on dvd 1 clearly then dvd 2 is putting it into drills

this dvd would be perfect for a dancer who already KNOWS how to dance ((all the high stared reviews are made by people who know how to belly dance!)) which YES the quick paste drills would be perfect for you! but for a Beginner.....no.

side note:I don't like the fact i cant practice with JUST the music. being a Beginner and only being able to try a move maybe five times, i really want to keep Practicing on movements ((hard-candy you can  do it with just music only))

am shocked these are ran by the same company but yet very different.",1408406400,6,2384,4.145336225596529

8610659,5,B00EZ6FXHU,"I have taken intermittent tribal style belly dance classes but never advanced very far and have also tried a few belly dance DVDs. I no longer live where I can take classes and I wanted something to continue my training. This DVD is the best I've seen. Irina breaks down each move, then each section advances you into combinations until you can put everything together into simple yet beautiful dance routines. I like the way this is organized and just practicing makes for a good workout.

I will say I might have found it a bit challenging if I was a complete beginner. Though using the first section until you get a good feel for things would work for a beginner, I'd just say take it slowly and don''t expect to be able to do all the moves right away. Learning to isolate areas of your body and getting your muscles used to certain moves takes time. She makes it look so easy, it might frustrate some people. Don't give up!

Irina is amazing and so beautiful. You could buy this DVD just to watch her performance at the end and it would be worth every penny.",1526774400,,1062,4.385786802030457

8610666,5,B00EZ6FXHU,"This instructional DVD is probably my absolute favorite of the ones I have purchased. I discovered Irina Akulenko first on Youtube through her short, free, instructional videos there. If you have found those and like them, this would be a good purchase. First of all, it starts with a good standing warm-up that reminds me a lot of the warm-up we do in my actual class. Standing warm-ups are great because they don't really require you to clear up a whole lot of space. Akulenko does an excellent job of showing how to perform each movement on both sides. On the second disc she combines all of these movements into short combinations and drills them. There's also a short choreography to learn at the end.",1496966400,,706,4.656
