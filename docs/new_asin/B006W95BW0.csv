8505454,2,B006W95BW0,"Rich guy Steven (Tom Sandoval) takes his near perfect girlfriend (Frida Farrell) to meet his parents. He stops along the way and gets jacked into a predictable plot, filled with tying people up and mild whipping. Unfortunately I had the film pegged just from reading the DVD description and before they got jacked....okay I didn't see that part coming.

The acting was fair, but face it, this wasn't much different than a home break-in film, without the quirky personalities we can relate to.  Available in a DVD 10 pack.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. Near sex. Near nudity.",1399593600,,569,4.90625

8505456,2,B006W95BW0,"Boyfriend of a dead girl takes revenge on the son of a god fearing, but paradoxically satanic-like, torture and killing family. A classic twisty kidnap thriller except the over scripting just made the story confusing resulting in little tension and drama. The acting is too over-the-top directed (stand here, move there like this) making the movie not very believable. The viewer feels as if they're standing along side the director hearing his directions. The dialogue is typical Hollywood make believe talk adding to that too staged feeling i.e. as if every short sentence is rehearsed and ""retaken"" multiple times. The usual dumb decisions that only characters in movies make.  The usual ""you think people are dead but they seem to come back with one last surprise knife attack"". A too predictable and emotionally ho hum movie.",1332547200,3,830,5.102941176470588
