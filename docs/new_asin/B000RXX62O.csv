8202993,5,B000RXX62O,"A well made cartoon. Stories that are humorous, but not maudlin. Clear audio and flawless look to the cartoon itself. The writers and actress took Pippi's unusual view on things and illustrated it very well.

It has an autostart feature after 10 seconds and will run the four cartoons for you if you don't do it yourself or pick an individual episode to see.

The quality is high as well. Audio and video look very good here.",1405468800,,425,4.5064935064935066

8202996,3,B000RXX62O,"I did not particularly enjoy this DVD, but of course, when you have a toddler, that isn't what counts. It is whether your toddler enjoys it. My 2.5 year old was quite taken with this DVD, at least for a time. She was very interested in what Pippi did, and it actually seemed to me that she would become sassier after watching these videos, in a negative way. Pippi, for those who do not know, is disrespectful to elders and teachers, and her parents are typically nowhere to be found. My daughter would pretend to lift things over her head, which is something Pippi does, and say things like, ""I'm not a grownup!"" which relates to one of the episodes, etc.  We actually got to a point where we took the DVD away for a while, because we thought it was negatively affecting her behavior. On the plus side, there are few good female role models for young children that are relatable, besides obvious ones like Dora, so this is still, all in all, a valuable edition to your video library.  We also recommend the Madeline series for young girls and toddlers.",1349481600,,1053,4.479166666666667
8202997,4,B000RXX62O,"When I was a young girl many years ago, I was fascinated by the stories of Pippi Longstocking's adventures as written by Astrid Lindgren. I also enjoyed watching the older television series featuring Inger Nilsson as Pippi. Here was a fearless young girl with her unique ponytails, embarking on adventures I could only dream of.

I was pleasantly surprised to find the animated version of Pippi Longstocking adapted from the original stories. There are several DVDs in the series and after checking several out from my local library, I found my first grader not only loves the stories but finds them engaging as well. In Pippi Goes to School, there are actually four episodes on the DVD with a running time of approximately 88 minutes total:

Pippi Doesn't Go to School - After listening to her friends, Pippi realizes that she is missing out on school holidays because she is not in school. So she joins her pals Annika and Tommy at the local school, only to cause uproar and chaos in the classroom with her typical Pippi antics!

Pippi Meets the White Lady - the nearby castle is haunted by the ghost of a white lady, but Pippi puts her sleuthing skills to work to figure out the mystery and put the ghost to rest.

Pippi Visits Aunt Matilda - Pippi and her pet monkey create a stir when she visits her Aunt Matilda. Pippi's attempts to help with chores result in hilarity - imagine cookies for dinner!

Pippi Doesn't Want to Grow Up - Pippi insists that she wants to remain her age and not grow up, but learns a lesson in the process.

The DVD also features English and French language tracks. The animation is actually quite decent, with vibrant colors and the stories are engaging. There are several other DVDs in the series such as Pippi Goes to the Fair, Pippi's Christmas, and many more.",1320537600,6,1795,4.61128526645768
