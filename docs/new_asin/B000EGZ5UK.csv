8109650,5,B000EGZ5UK,"""Skating Through Time: Great Performances from the U.S. Figure Skating Championships Volume 2,"" hosted by Dick Button and Peggy Fleming, contains these skates:

Scott Hamilton - 1984 (Men's Singles, long program)
Tara Lipinski - 1997 (Ladies Singles, long program)
Yamaguchi & Galindo - 1989 (Pairs, long program)
Jill Trenary - 1990 (Ladies Singles, long program)
Johnny Weir - 2004 (Men's Singles, long program)
Elaine Zayak - 1994 (Ladies Singles, long program)
O'Connor & Millins - 1976 (Dance, long program)
Michelle Kwan - 1998 (Ladies Singles, long program)
Kitty & Peter Carruthers - 1980 (Pairs, long program)
Paul Wylie - 1990 (Men's Singles, long program)
Janet Lynn - 1970 (Ladies Singles, long program)

Worth the price of admission for Michelle Kwan's sublimely delicate, tender, and airily light ""Lyra Angelica"" alone, which (as did her short program) brought at least two male judges to tears, and for which programs she earned a total unprecedented 15 of a possible 18 perfect 6.0 scores (7 of possible 9 in the short, 8 of a possible 9 in the long program).  And this would be the first of her record 8 consecutive gold medals in this competition.

The videos are as good as can be expected for the times they were made, and as the technology evolved.",1290124800,9,1269,4.971698113207547
8109651,4,B000EGZ5UK,"I have all three volumes of this series so my reviews of them are all the same and pretty generalized.  The series presents performances by the really well-known and, ""who?"" skaters from US Nationals over the years.  They are a mixed bag.  I found myself in rapt attention with a number of them and others I either thought, ""that's nice, we'll call....NEXT!"", and a few did not get viewed because I didn't like the skater when they were on the scene and really didn't care about them.  Interesting things to note, Dick Button is rather quiet in the early year clips and you can track his increase in verbosity if you play the clips in order of their years.  Another, the decline of artistry and edge work as the years go on.  The DVDs have a very easy menu format in which the individual skater's tracks come up as a list when you start the DVD so you can pick and choose your own order, rather than having to use the ""menu"" button constantly.  It's not a bad set to own and doesn't bore with repeated viewings so, in the end, I recommend buying it.",1260835200,5,1049,4.348717948717948
