ps. I NEVER give a bad review unless it's REALLY BAD.",1494028800,,324,4.366666666666666
7929661,4,B000051WAH,"good documentary, though several playback problems, especially with audio (silent and glitchy for several minutes at a time).

fascinating topic.",1487894400,,145,6.25
7929662,4,B000051WAH,"As a high school teacher, I found that this video passes the basic test of an 'educational' video--it informs and entertains.  My freshmen enjoyed it and stayed focused.  The information is accurate and presented in an interesting and coherent manner.  Good use is made of Hollywood archival footage as well as live shots from a school in northern Italy devoted to recreating the lives of gladiators down to the smallest detail.  Backed by concise background information on the Roman Republic and Empire.  It would also be of interest to anyone with an interest in the Roman Empire, and good background for such Hollywood films as Spartacus and Gladiator.  Recommended.  4 and a half stars.",1164067200,4,690,5.0
7929663,1,B000051WAH,This is the WORST DVD I ever bought technically!  The movie excerpts are from clippings from old films and the clarity is beyond recognition.  I find the excerpts very irritating.  They were a lot of flickering (as if you are watching a movie or television show using an old television set or your set back to the 1950's when the frame of the TV screen keeps on flickering continuously until the screen stabilizes).  The running time is actually more or less an hour and not 90 minutes as advertised. The special features are not really special anymore because they were just repeats of the main feature.  You will realize that you will watching the same scenes a couple of times.  Some scenes are shown more than five times just to stretch the time.  Do not waste your money with this DVD. I wasted mine! This is not a DVD quality.  The quality of the silent movies are much better!,1022544000,14,883,4.509433962264151
7929664,5,B000051WAH,"I thought this video was an excellent documentary, which should be viewed alongside the recent Academy Award winning movie.  This documentary helps one really understand the times portrayed in the movie.  I thorougly recommend this video.",988761600,8,238,5.583333333333333
