3555976,3,B001ELXSOY,"For a Ti Lung Shaw brother movie that I have never seen before it was pretty good. The transfer does have a few grain issues but overall it looks really good.

To me this was just not one of the better of the Shaw Brothers movies.

It deals with the Opium issues that China went thru during the western invasion.  However, I just did not feel for the characters. I also thought there was not enough KF action.

Ti Lung always gives a good performance, however, this is not one of his better movies.",1268611200,,498,4.26595744680851
3555977,4,B001ELXSOY,"This film has been difficult to find in the past. Not exactly a lost classic, certainly not obscure -given the cast, but I am certainly grateful to Celestial and Jade Tiger for making this fine print available. I have been waiting for someone to transfer some of these classics on to Blu Ray. Celestial bought the rights to DVD release the entire Shaw filmography and the have done a great job. Films that have been available only as awful VHS prints were digitally remastered lovingly, way beyond what I thoght possible.
  That said- this has not been mastered from an original film print but instead is an upscaled DVD, mastered as a Blu Ray disc. Anime fans have been getting this shaft for a while, now it looks like martial arts movie fans are the latest victims.
Don't get me wrong, this is a beautiful print, like most Celestial prints, it is not however true HD.
  The sound on this disc is poor, I have Celestial DVD's with far better sound quality, I am not sure what the issue was with the audio.
  Shaw Brothers fans will have to wait with their fingers crossed hoping someone will be willing to put the effort Celestial did with DVD for true HD Shaw titles.
This disc comes included with a beautiful liner notes booklet, filled with great photos and information.

  Movie- 5 Stars
  Print- 4 Stars
  Audio- 2 Stars
  Extras- 4 Stars (beautifl liner notes, interviews etc.)",1250467200,12,1385,4.595918367346939
3555978,5,B001ELXSOY,"A true Shaw Brother's Classic.  Great fighting Sceens and a real drama too.  The film shows the ugly truth of drug addition. The Kung Fu Master who thinks his casual use of Opium is harmless. Soon learns the folly of his actions. As he first looses some of his student to the drug and then himself. In the end he tries to redeem himself, fight off the druglords that control it, and honor his fallen students.",1246492800,3,409,4.368421052631579
3555979,4,B001ELXSOY,"If you are looking for a lot of martial arts action that is well choreographed, it's worth spending the money to get this relatively inexpensive blu ray. I'd never heard of this movie until I read the review on bluray.com and since the price was so reasonable on Amazon, I decided to buy it.

The plot is predictable and laughingly melodramatic - my wife and I sat there cracking up at the cheesy acting - but the fight scenes are very well executed. And there are plenty of fight scenes, starting up at the slightest provocation.

The picture quality in blu ray is excellent, especially considering the age of the movie. Sound quality is okay, about as good as you can expect. The sound effects of things like swords clinking against each other are pretty repetitive, just the same effect used over and over no matter what part of the swords hit each other.

If you want a good martial arts action flick and aren't looking for something deep, plus you want good picture quality, this movie would be a good choice.",1245715200,6,1014,4.56043956043956

8298765,5,B001ELXSOY,"Finally, a Chinese kung-fu movie that is a fable, lessons to be learned about drug addictions (opium in this case) based on a period in China when opium addiction was wide spread that brought about the Opium War in the 1800s.  However, China lost that war against westerners, which resulted in foreign occupations of Chinese cities after the war that included Hong Kong, so it's nice to see that this movie is in Cantonese with English subtitles.

In this particular town, there is a kung-fu master who is new and has helped driven out bandits and other bad guys.  Opium became a new pass time, and rich folks smoke them at home, while poor folks smoked them in opium dens, which are historical facts.  Westerners brought opium to China in large quantities while taking spices and financial gains after doping the Chinese.  At first the Chinese had no idea that opium was an addictive substance until many families were destroyed from financial ruins after the Chinese were hooked and were willing to pay any amount of money to continue their addiction.  Rich folks became poor, poor folks committed suicides, etc.  It was so out of control that the Chinese government deemed this to be a manipulation by western foreign interference of the Chinese culture and family structure that they declared war on imports of opium by western countries.  At the thought of huge revenue lost if the imports stopped, the British and other western nations sent ships to Chinese ports.  The emperor's army and weak navy were no match against the guns and cannons of the British navy.  Opium continued to flow into China and the Chinese always hated those who made loads of money off of a destructive import.  This is no different than the Colombian drug cartels importing cocaine into the U.S., but imagine if they had the backing of the Colombian government, which then sends their Navy into the U.S. and wins.  That's what it was like during this time in China.

So, this movie is based on that period of China when the Chinese were ruined by opium.  Most people could not stop their addiction and there were no drug addiction clinics.  The only way they knew how to stop opium addiction was by locking individuals in rooms or tied them up in beds.  They had to be isolated for a few days or weeks until they overcame the addiction cold turkey.  The opium addiction caused people to lose jobs, their mental health and families, and in this movie, their kung-fu skills/strength.  The master himself was being taught by his own student that he needed to admit to his addiction and stop ruining his life and the lives of others who count on him.  Though the kung-fu weapon fights were well choreographed, you have to like the plot to like the movie as it's not the old good vs. bad kung-fu movies.  This story has a bit of humor, a bit of romance/flirtation, a bit of Chinese family and community culture, and a bit of just the good vs. bad, a bit of right and wrong, and most of all a bit of what life was like when opium was brought to China.  Great fable based on a real period in China.",1487376000,2,3074,4.593406593406593
