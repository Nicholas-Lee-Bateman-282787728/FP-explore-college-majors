Their seven-person line-up permits them a formidable variety of instrumental combinations, and these are displayed to the full in this well-filmed live video, both in dance tunes and behind the singing of Muireann Nic Amhlaoibh. Particularly entertaining is the solo set, where the musicians play in turn and then walk off, leaving just Donnchadh Gough, who seems to hit the bodhrn like Bruce Lee hitting a punch bag!

There are also several well-chosen special guests.

In addition to the concert (in surround sound), there are interviews with each musician, and a segment on the band's history.  The only extra I found less than fascinating was ""On the Road"", which is basically a sequence of home movies made on tour; but even that is skilfully put together.

Making a total of well over 3 hours, clearly a labour of love, and all for a few bucks more than the price of a CD.

I've never seen better than this.  If you get a chance to see them live, don't miss it.

P.S. At the start of his interview, Dnal Clancy plays a lovely little piece in DADGAD tuning, the title of which is never given.

I had a chance to ask him: it's called ""Dog Rock"", after a rock he used to fish off that is behind where he's sitting in the DVD.",1246752000,,1415,4.561264822134388
