2814598,5,B000P7V6TM,I saw this version when it originaly aired on PBS and I was very imppressed . My favorite actor was Matt Lucas Of Little Britain fame . He made the movie for me . Not to mention the great Bob Hoskins . I wish I remembered the other actors names seeing that they were great in their roles as well . If you are a fan of the original story or the other versions you will probably like this one as well .,1178755200,28,400,3.8313253012048194
2814599,5,B000P7V6TM,"The very best production of this tale.  Sometimes titled ""Toad's Wild Ride"" this version is truer to the original book than most.  Played by real actors, not animated ""cartoon"" characters, you'll probably enjoy it more than a few times.  But then, almost anything PBS produces in their ""Masterpiece Theater"" line is good.",1413244800,,321,5.134615384615385

2814605,4,B000P7V6TM,Wind in the willows is a enjoyable family oriented movie. I have always enjoyed the story. The movie is just as good,1393459200,,116,4.318181818181818
2814606,5,B000P7V6TM,"I grew up with the book and the Disney animated movie, but I truly loved this version of this classic story. It is warm, funny and very well done. Every child should see this movie and every adult should see it again and again.",1391990400,,227,4.181818181818182
2814607,3,B000P7V6TM,I do not remember the book being so difficult. Might have to watch it again to see if the failure was mine,1391817600,,106,3.8636363636363638
2814608,3,B000P7V6TM,"Regrettably, this is not the full version of the film.  Probably to fit in with the timing for Masterpiece Theatre, they have taken out some lovely scenes, and scenes which I think are essential to the full development of the characters and their relationship - particularly that of Ratty and Mole.  The complete film follows the book pretty closely.  Had I known this was not the full version, I would not have bought it.  Having said that, it's still a lovely movie, but the full film as intended by the Director and Producer is far superior.  Further, there are no extras with this version, and there are with the full BBC version.",1383609600,6,634,4.625
2814609,5,B000P7V6TM,Perfect. Great for any age and I have already passed it around the family.  I will watch it again and again!,1382486400,,108,4.142857142857143
2814610,5,B000P7V6TM,"This classic story as only Masterpiece Theatre can present it is charming and hilarious, heart-warming and boisterous.  Matt Lucas, Michael Murphy, Jim Carter and Bob Hoskins are superb.  Adults and children can watch it together. We sent a DVD of Wind in the Willows to our grandson and he loves it.  We keep a copy here to watch when he visits.",1372204800,,346,4.639344262295082
2814611,3,B000P7V6TM,"The movie was okay, really was not crazy about it.  Maybe I need to watch it again; sometimes the second time around there is a different take on it.  Not completely dissatisfied but a little disappointed.",1371772800,,205,4.666666666666667
2814612,5,B000P7V6TM,"Sweet movie, made me laugh.  I liked having actors, who got into their roles, rather than cartoon characters. Mr. toad was exceptional.",1362787200,,135,5.136363636363637
2814613,5,B000P7V6TM,"I've always liked the Wind in the Willows story, and having actors play the parts was wonderful, even though I only recognized Bob Hoskins.",1361750400,,139,4.833333333333333
2814614,4,B000P7V6TM,"Have never read the book. This movie is rather strange. I kept watching to the end even though I spent most of the movie thinking, ""This is kinda weird!""  The people-animals did make me smile. Perhaps if I watch it again I will ""get it!""",1360540800,,237,4.266666666666667
2814615,1,B000P7V6TM,"I saw the stage production of The Wind in the Willows in London in 1994, and was hooked!  I have since read the book at least a half a dozen times, and love the story and its characters.

When I saw that Masterpiece Theater had done a rendition I was eager to see it, and placed an order for the DVD.  Unfortunately this rendition is completely our of character with the book, and misses all the nuance of the original. I'm shocked the Masterpiece Theater would do such injustice to a classic.

Every part was poorly acted and overdone, none of Kenneth Graham's brilliant dialog was used, and the scream-play is very poorly assembled.  Toad was dreadful and entirely unsympathetic.  It appeared that no one involved had read the book (or seen the play).

I'm glad I didn't see this first.  I never would have read the book!",1342396800,2,823,4.513513513513513
2814616,3,B000P7V6TM,"I found this film entrancing. I agree with those who gave the film 5 stars but was gravely disappointed that PBS edited out the Christmas sequence altogether - ripping out the most emotionally compelling and charming part of the film. Mole watching the human family in the village through the window, Mole longing for his own hole, Rat's compassion when he makes Mole's hole into a warm home, the appearance of the caroling field mice children and the feast that follows. Time restraints or no, by consigning these scenes to the cutting room floor PBS wrenched the heart right out of the film. I am hoping I can find a dvd of the complete film (which I saw recently on cable TV) at a UK sight.",1327104000,10,693,4.507936507936508
2814617,5,B000P7V6TM,"Although limited in comparison to the book, I was delighted with this quirky, simple film, the sets, the costuming, the directing, and the truly wonderful cast! It took me back to childhood, and made me giggle and smile throughout--and what in life is better than a few giggles and smiles?!",1253491200,2,290,4.82
2814618,5,B000P7V6TM,"The Wind in the WIllows is a complex and beautiful tale. When producers are forced to boil it down into about 90 minutes a great deal of the substance of the story is lost.  In this version ""The Piper At The Gates of Dawn"" and ""Dulce Domum"" are completely deleted, and some characters like Otter are also missing or barely covered.

Nevertheless this is a fine TV production which is faithful to much of the spirit and all of the beauty of the book.  It is set in an Elysian Field of a countryside along a beautiful stream where it always seems to be fair weather.  The primary cast is limited to Mole, Rat, Toad, and Badger, with a number of smaller parts including an appropriately deviant looking group of Weasels and Stoats.  No one wears an animal costume, but the characteristics of each animal is well portrayed: Rat the country middle class gentleman, Toad the nouveau riche upstart, Badger the aristocrat, and Mole the somewhat proletarian but rising fast arriviste. The story primarily focusses on Toad and his adventures, which are appropriately hilarious.

While this production will never replace the book, it will entertain and amuse on its own, and more importantly, help to introduce Grahsme's story to new readers.",1242259200,9,1231,4.81042654028436
2814619,5,B000P7V6TM,"This movie is a treat--an imaginative combination of theatrical costumes and movie techniques. I would recommend it to adults and to any child old enough to have enjoyed the actual Kenneth Grahame book.  I would watch it with the kid.  It does have a shadow side--it's not a cartoon.  Mr. Toad is not psychotic, but he's certainly bipolar. His friends care about him even though they get inconvenienced and annoyed.  The stoats and weasels lurk and lurch--but like good storybook villains, they get scared off .  Moley is timid and it's hard to get him out of his comfort zone (underground in the meadow) but when his friends urge him on, his world expands and he has adventures.  Mr. Badger has courage and he's gruff at times, but he brings order out of chaos and knows when to fight and when to fall back.  The situations and lesser characters are just plain funny--the jailer's daughter, so pretty despite bad teeth, the aunt who's---a---washerwoman, the flirty flinty train engineer, the tough barge woman who matches wits with Toad, and the adorable upper class couple who lose their roadster to Toad not once but twice.  Toad's highs are higher than anybody's, and his lows are very low, but who has more fun than Toad?",1209427200,3,1226,4.75
2814620,5,B000P7V6TM,"This re-telling of a classic was absolutely wonderful!  We enjoyed it immensely, and laughed throughout the story.  The use of human actors who take on a bit of animal characteristics (not unlike in the story where the animals take on very human characteristics) added so much to this production.

As mentioned before, Toad was absolutely spectacular, and really defined the character for the audience.  I loved this, and after seeing it on PBS, am purchasing the DVD for home use.",1207612800,3,481,4.975
2814621,5,B000P7V6TM,"This is a absolutely delightful version of the tales that gains it's strength from not being animated and the incredible performances of all of the real actors, particularly Toad and Badger.  The tiniest tot to ancient adults will be enraptured by humans playing animals and the human actors allow the satire of the original stories to shine through.  Don't miss it unless you care to wait for the HD version to come out which was even richer when shown originally by PBS in HD.",1199750400,3,478,4.678571428571429
2814622,3,B000P7V6TM,"This is not made for children. Gorgeous scenery. I bought the movie, thinking that since real actors and not kiddish cartooning was featured, that there would be a serious rendition of the book.  The constant harping on Mr. Toad's psychotic behavior was entertaining but too much like all other rendtions: too in the face.  Two grand chapters were cut from this movie and thus a great deal of the heart of the story are gone. Really left the story askew and slanted. We get to experience Mr. Toad's puffed up personality but not Ratty's yearning to go out into the wide world and we don't experience Mole's deep need for home or the animal's encounter with their own deity.  Quite sad that this honorable book is treated so shabbily.",1198540800,17,733,4.666666666666667
2814623,1,B000P7V6TM,"I watched this on Masterpiece Theater.  I have been a fan of this series since childhood and was looking forward to this adaptation.  My mistake.  The entire thing was unwatchable.  The characters were either downright ridiculous, annoying to watch or just plain boring.  I couldn't even finish watching this, it was that bad.  Whoever thought of putting humans to act as animals in this film deserves the dunce cap.  There is nothing entertaining in watching grown men running around and acting like fools for an hour and a half.  The idiocy of the portrayals is evident by the screaming of the characters and the lame attempts at humor.  Do yourself a favor and buy the Cosgrove Hall production instead.  I cannot fathom how Masterpiece Theater put this nonsense out for viewers to watch.  Giving this one star is even too much, but I must say the scenery in the film was beautiful.  That is all I can say that was good, pity it was not filmed in England, although as you know, the stories are based there.  I would not take this even if it was free.",1196035200,8,1052,4.561497326203209
2814624,5,B000P7V6TM,This actor based version of this timeless classic is first rate.  Wonderful production and acting.,1188864000,10,98,5.533333333333333
2814625,1,B000P7V6TM,"If you have kids, they might like this movie but I sure didn't.  It was just silly and boring.",1187481600,2,94,3.9473684210526314
2814626,5,B000P7V6TM,i have watched this show over and over and still cannot get enough it is the best show i have seen on masterpeice theatre the actor who portrays toad is excellent as are the others  the english seem to bury their hollywood counterparts and this is no exception strongly recommend it,1185667200,3,282,4.529411764705882
2814627,3,B000P7V6TM,"This is perhaps my favorite book of all time.  This version stays fairly close to the book, although much is skipped over for time purposes.  The incredible lyricism of the book is almost entirely lost in this rendition, unfortunately.  However, Matt Lucas' Toad is, if possible, even funnier than in the book.  Side splittingly, tear jerkingly funny.  He is a joy to watch.  I was disappointed that they completely glossed over my favorite chapter of the book - The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, but that might be hard to do justice in video/film form.  Suitable for kids, adults will be disappointed if looking for a dramatic masterpiece.  If you haven't read the book - do so.  If you've read it to your kids, they will enjoy this video.",1184630400,26,738,4.615384615384615
2814628,1,B000P7V6TM,"My girlfriend and I watched this on PBS and we both thought it was a dreadful rendition of what I knew was a beautiful story.  Since I have known and loved this story since childhood and she didn't, I thought that maybe her comments were adversely affecting my own opinions, so I watched it again, alone.  I didn't watch very long!  Buy the book instead.  I did.",1179100800,5,362,4.358208955223881
8189890,5,B000P7V6TM,"The disc is in perfect shape, and this is a pretty faithful adaptation to the book. It is absolutely hilarious. That guy whom plays Mr. Toad knocks it right out of the park. Great film.",1492387200,,185,4.314285714285714

8189893,5,B000P7V6TM,This is an excellent adaptation of this story. I particularly love Matt Lucas as Toad. And Ratty is extremely loveable. I need to watch this again soon now I have children to enjoy it with.,1467590400,,189,4.428571428571429
8189894,5,B000P7V6TM,"This is a great old PBS movie and my teenage daughter loved it!  I was afraid she wouldn't like it as much as the cartoon version, but I think she quite prefers this Masterpiece Theatre edition.",1434240000,,194,4.388888888888889

8189897,5,B000P7V6TM,"Excellently acted, and the costuming is good as well.  Brings the story to life well.  The kids love it as well as me.  A true family movie, not a kid family movie.  Quite happy",1419897600,,177,4.117647058823529
