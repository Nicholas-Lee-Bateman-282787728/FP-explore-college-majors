8458544,1,B0055PK67C,"First of all this was supposed to be a 3 DVD set, but it only came as 1 DVD. Basically the facilitator read and showed a chart that you would set goals with and rate the goals. That's basically all it was. This was the worst DVD I have ever purchased and for a high amount of money - $17.00. Don't buy this. Maybe I would buy it for $5.00, but don't waste your hard earned money.",1316822400,3,379,3.935064935064935
