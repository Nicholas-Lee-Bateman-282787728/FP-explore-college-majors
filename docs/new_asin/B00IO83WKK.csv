The best of ourselves is this human spirit that wants to discover and explore and find the next great thing. But that's coupled with the worst of ourselves: desperation for greatness, vigilante law, everyone out for themselves. You can see & feel all of it in this story. What I particularly loved was that about halfway through I realized that the images I was seeing weren't all old photos from the time. They were live camera shots in b&w. You could see the leaves blowing in the wind as you looked upon these old ghost towns that had been left standing. It made it all the more chilling to know that I could have been standing right where that camera was and it would have been the same. The makers of the film didn't try to 'jazz up' the information for our new time. They trusted the towns to tell their own stories by way of their very presence and simply paired it with great story-telling & narration, which I thought was brave and lovely. The final shot of the film is one I want framed and put in my house...a gorgeous film with a captivating story. All around, well worth the watching.",1402272000,3,1274,4.425531914893617

8643848,5,B00IO83WKK,"A great documentary about towns of the Old West. I saw the preview in Alma, Colorado. When the film got to the part shot at South Park City Museum (six miles from Alma) the room exploded in applause. Everyone loved it!",1427500800,,218,4.341463414634147
8643849,5,B00IO83WKK,"I saw this film at a historic theatre in Denver and was impressed by the care and research put into the movie. The cinematography was rich, and the subjectsghost towns which hold a silent historyshare their mood and skeletal remains. A testament to the changing times of the gold rush and the westward bound period, it is very interesting to see what remains of a time gone by. The narration and score are excellent, and the material is profound. Looking forward to more films by this production company!",1426982400,,504,4.738636363636363
8643850,5,B00IO83WKK,"This documentary is one of those rare films that manages to pair rigorous historical research with art. The rise and fall of several ghost towns of the American West is carefully detailed and fantastic archival photos included to complement the stories. But beyond that, the contemporary black & white footage of what remains of these towns is stunning and certainly makes the case for there simply being something special about old-fashioned analog film. Perhaps especially when it's being used to capture places that were last fully alive over a hundred years ago. The combination of these elements throughout the film is masterful.

If you enjoy the history of the Old West, are a connoisseur of ghost towns, and/or appreciate evocative abandonment photography, you cannot go wrong with Ghosts of the West. I've watched it twice already and will certainly view it again soon. That's my highest recommendation!",1410825600,3,912,5.204081632653061
8643851,5,B00IO83WKK,"This DVD presents us history and its context, but it also gives us insights into the lives of the places. Especially fine is the score by Adrian Hernandez. It is a cut above what might be expected for this genre--interesting, haunting, and bright.",1405641600,3,247,4.767441860465116
