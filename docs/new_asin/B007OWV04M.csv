8519937,2,B007OWV04M,"This is a remake with some updates of the legendary movie L'EMMERDEUR starring Lino Ventura and Jacques Brel.

This remake is a pale shadow of the original movie.

The only interest in watching this remake is to make some comparisions with L'EMMERDEUR.",1385769600,,252,4.976190476190476

""Pain in the Ass"" is a fairly close remake of a 1973 film, ""L'emmerdeur,"" which at one time was released in the US on VHS tape, under the title ""A Pain in the A**."" Both are hilarious, though this newer version is missing one final scene from the original. Be aware, if you happened to see the earlier version, you are not getting it here.

Milan is a hitman, assigned to assassinate a key organized-crime witness before he can testify. He plans to do this by holing up in a hotel across the street from the courthouse, then shooting the witness with a high-powered rifle as police lead him in from the street. Easy-peasey plan. Not much can go wrong.

Except for the total pain in the ass who happens to be in the hotel room next door. Pignon is a self-centered, whiny, depressive twit who believes that suicide attempts might win back his lost wife -- an attention-getting ploy. Attention, from the hotel staff  or (worse) the police, is the last thing Milan wants. So he's forced to ever-increasing lengths to keep Pignon in line. The scheduled timetable for the planned assassination adds a note of suspense to this plot, and Pignon is so unbearable, you've never rooted for a professional assassin so much.

Unless you were to hire one yourself, to kill whoever was responsible for this DVD. It's awful. Now, the print is clear and bright, very good, and it is widescreen. That's all you can say. It has no Menu. It has no features. The only language is the original French, and the only subtitles are English, permanently burnt on (they cannot be removed). When placed in the tray, it will PLAY automatically -- it's not capable of doing anything else. Honestly, I've bootlegs that were produced with more effort. This Amazon ""Pressed On Demand"" DVD gives you the film but absolutely nothing else. I suspect the original source was in fact a Laserdisc, as a superimposed credit at the extreme end of the film says ""Laser subtitling by so-and-so."" In short, it's a legal bootleg itself, a digital copy.

It's still worth it to see this very funny film. It's a darn shame the original version has never appeared on DVD. That's a pain in the a**.",1365206400,2,2199,4.596938775510204
