8017948,5,B0001XLXJ8,"considering i own the trilogy set for violent s--t! this is the uncensored version of what is known here in the states as violent s--t 4.0
which runs 80 min. this one runs 1 hr. and 40 min and is known as german trash horror.  the story line for this is very hard for me to discribe yet is the best out of the four, but without having seen the first three, seeing this one would be very confusing and would make no sense to uninitiated in this what seems to be the end of this film series. many horror fans have given very low reviews for this film and the first three because they don't understand low budget, & i mean lower budget than even troma which spends at least $3,000,000 on their films. this costs less than a million to make and is very good for a blue collar horror film. think herchel gordon lewis if he was german, but much creepier and evil and you have andreas schnaas.",1401580800,,886,4.181286549707602

8017950,5,B0001XLXJ8,"I had really low expectations for this movie because of the low rating that it has on IMDB, but I loved it and I realized that it has a low rating only because most of the people that rated it badly took it seriously when it's a movie that really shouldn't be taken seriously! Honestly, the only reasons why Andreas Schnaas's movies have such low ratings is because they have bad acting, because they're not very well made and because they're stupid! Ok, those are good reasons to trash a lot of movies, but not low budget gory movies! Andreas' movies are very entertaining, funny (in a stupid way) and gory and that's all that they're supposed to be! People who hate movies because of bad acting shouldn't be allowed to review low budget gory movies because acting isn't important in those movies! Anyway, this movie is very entertaining, it has a few funny parts (like the part with Lloyd Kaufman and Debbie Rochon, the part when Hitler gets killed in a gory way, etc...), the acting isn't too bad compared to the acting in the director's other movies, the soundtrack is pretty good, it has a nice shower scene that looks like something from a porno (:p) and it's VERY gory (and most of the effects are awesome! But I have to say that the effects are much better in the first 50 minutes. A lot of the effects after that aren't really good... It's like the special effects guys got tired)!

For gore fans ONLY. You're not a fan of low budget gory movies and you hate bad acting? Don't watch it or watch it, but don't rate it because your opinion on low budget gory movies is pretty much worthless. Low budget gory movies should be rated based on how entertaining and gory they are.",1256947200,5,1682,4.461038961038961
