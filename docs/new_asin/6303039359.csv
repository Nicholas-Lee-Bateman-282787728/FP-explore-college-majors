This is a rare western movie that features an all African-American cast with a story similar to other movies from that era. ""You fool, you've killed him!"" Two cowboys happen to ride by, they are looking for a job. ""The Lord helps those who help themselves."" Does Dusty need glasses? Slim the cook shoots at cans with a gun that fits his hand. ""Shooting the bull?"" Bob Blake is from Amarillo-way. Joe Connors is the foreman. Bob sings a song about a lone cowboy being called home. There is action later at night. ""This will probably cost me my job."" Mr. Watson makes a change. Slim and Dusty go to see Mr. Dennison. There is some comedy. Watson and Blake arrive there with the sheriff. Cactus plans to hunt ""skunks"". Tex was shot in the back. There is another song.

Blake will ride into town for the mail. He is warned against his curiosity. Can an innocent man be framed by a dropped glove? Can Bradley find the hidden mine? Dennison's daughter will arrive with money. Will Bradley plan a trick? Can Blake escape jail to help Miss Dennison? A letter reveals Bradley's plans to the sheriff. There is a chase, then a shootout. Will the sheriff's men arrive in time to save Blake and Miss Dennison? Yes. Cactus gets that skunk. There is a happy ending for all of the good guys. [Continuity?]

This is a typical Western where a small rancher's property is saved by a heroic cowboy. This movie is a low-budget production, but worth watching once. Note the mention of a valuable radium ore mine. There must have been a wide interest in radium before WW II.",1285200000,,1586,4.519163763066202
