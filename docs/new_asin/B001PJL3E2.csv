8333456,3,B001PJL3E2,"Absolutely so-bad-it's-bad Spanish-language, Mexican-U.S. co-production sci-fi/horror film.  Boris Karloff, in one of his last films, plays a scientist who discovers a living rock life-form in a volcano and brings it back to his lab so he can discover what makes it tick.  Realizing what makes the stone get going is fear, the rock doc and his underlings hire young women and create weird scenarios so they can extract fear fluid from the girls and feed their pet rock.  After all that things get really offbeat and strange.  The quality of the DVD is excellent, but I think there may be a longer version out there.  Can you imagine?  Only for the bad movie fan.",1395446400,,662,4.7631578947368425
