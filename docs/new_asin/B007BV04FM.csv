8514098,5,B007BV04FM,"Love, love, love that Sequential Spelling is on DVD-rom.  The kids can do there spelling without my help.  My 7th grader uses the computer and types in her answers while my 5th grader uses the TV and writes his answers (more handwriting practice).  The versatility is great!",1420848000,,274,4.787234042553192
