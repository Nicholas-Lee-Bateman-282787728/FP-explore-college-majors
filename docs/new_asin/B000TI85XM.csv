8209522,5,B000TI85XM,I live in the town in which the movie shot so i watched just to see the familiar places.... and I was surprised to find that I liked the movie for the story itself.,1198972800,2,164,3.8529411764705883
8209523,5,B000TI85XM,"This story is a well thought out and perfectly paced piece that lays out on the screen virtually without flaw. I won't give away the ending and definitely didn't see it coming. I can tell you, though, that despite the typical small town gossip that seems hurtful and shallow, the two main characters rise above it all with through their strength and love with a forgiveness that can only be bound by blood.

Solid film making by all involved.",1192579200,2,442,4.594936708860759
8209524,5,B000TI85XM,"Although Scarlett Chorvat is a newcomer, she holds her own with seasoned vets.  Liz Torres is very funny and keeps it lighthearted.  The ending answers the often repeated question ""who are you"", Taylor.  The kitchen scene is comical in a film that is a mix of drama and suspense. The location house is beautiful and the film reflects its grandure.",1192492800,2,347,4.75
