8096913,5,B000CC91H4,"I did not know much about the international or even the national mountain biking scene when I first watched this film.  I had heard of Adam Craig and that was about it as far as American XC cyclists go.  But it's a testament to the film that I wasn't discouraged, and even my wife found it extremely watchable -- and she barely tolerates my discussions on mountain biking!  Like all great documentaries, knowledge and an appreciation for the subject matter at hand is not necessary for you to enjoy this film.  I would recommend it to any fan of documentaries or individual sports.",1196294400,,581,4.611650485436893
8096914,5,B000CC91H4,"It's too bad I can only give 5 stars; this isn't just a great cycling movie, it's a great movie. Great filming, great editing, and terrific storytelling. There's a reason this thing swept the festivals.

The world of cycling is a bit of a mystery even for those who follow it regularly; you almost have to piece together your own accounts and pieces to get a tangible story.

In OFTA, the filmmakers seized on a major development in the 2004 Olympic qualification process and documented all the trials of America's best riders over the course of a year. The events are extremely well documented, beautifully photographed, and weaved together to tell a riveting story.

SUMMARY (NO SPOILERS): In 2004, the US was in a position where it could only send 2 males and 1 female to the Olympics for mountain biking. USA Cycling announced that its qualification process would rely on points garnered international federation races (UCI), with a secondary emphasis on world cup standing for the men. The chase for points begins in south america and follows the athletes through Europe and North America.

As the story progresses, you really get to know the athletes and share many private moments and breakdowns. The film is well edited to highlight the tension of each race as well as the confusion and frustration over the qualification system.

Non-cyclists will have no trouble following the story. The film does an excellent job of shedding light on some of the big problems created by the USA cycling points system. Typically, these athletes would make their own schedules and train according to what works best for them. They would peak for certain preferred races as well as top national and international events. The USA cycling points system instead virtually mandated them to show up at all the top point races. These 8 riders had never appeared at the same race together before, but found themselves traveling together at every race for the course of a season.

The sport is so consuming; it's a lifestyle and that is readily apparent to anyone, regardless of their familiarity with cycling. To paraphrase a quote from the movie, to race at this level, it must be the number one priority in your life. Everything you choose to do or not do each day must be in support of your goal of racing and competing.

This film is a classic. I'm going on to Gripped Films site to buy a copy. I also own their other one, ""24 Solo"", which I just watched with my parents (non-cyclists). They loved it as well.",1179878400,4,2498,4.755196304849885
8096915,4,B000CC91H4,"A very interesting behind the scenes look at what it takes to make the Olympic Team...it just so happens to be about bikers, but would appeal to those not necessarily interested in biking. It is captivating from start to finish!",1175817600,,228,4.725
8096916,5,B000CC91H4,"Very few mountain biking films (or cycling films for that matter) are really good films in themselves.  Many concentrate on extreme action sequences without any actual story line.  In contrast, ""Off Road To Athens"" contains the real and interesting story of the American mountain bikers (women and men) who were the contenders for the 3 precious spots on the 2004 Olympic team.

The movie is beautifully filmed (with great editing) and really portrays the cyclists' passion for mountain biking as well as competing.  Following the racers on the 2004 World Cup circuit, the film captures spectacular scenery in Europe and Canada, as well as mountain biking footage that really portrays what mountain biking and racing is all about.",1168992000,,730,5.161016949152542
8096917,5,B000CC91H4,"One word describes this movie: INCREDIBLE. I highly recommend it to anyone who has ever ridden a bike. It has a great human element to it, and isn't full of thrash metal music like most free ride/DH movies. It will also keep you going on those long trainer rides over the winter!

The riders aren't high priced egomaniacs like most pro athletes, they are very personable people who are a pleasure to talk to. My wife and I have spoken with some of them at races, and emailed back and forth with them too. Very cool people.

The soundtrack is awesome, action sequences great and even the hardest roadie and non-cycling fans have been converted to MTB fans. SEE THIS MOVIE!",1145145600,2,671,4.537190082644628
8096918,5,B000CC91H4,This DVD is a fantastic look at Mtn Bike racing at the Pro level while telling the story of the 2004 selection for the USA Olympic team. Candid shots and personal interviews are blended in with race footage from various international countries.,1136592000,2,244,4.833333333333333
