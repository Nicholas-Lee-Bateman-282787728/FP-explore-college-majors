7565088,5,B0197DPAM8,"19-2, Season 1. Precinct 19, Car 2. This intense Canadian television serial is a character-driven crime drama  about partners in the Montreal, Canada police department who must put their differences aside as their lives intertwine professionally and personally.  It is an English-language remake of a popular Quebec show that has won Canadian Screen Awards for Best Dramatic Series and Best Actor for Jared Keeso, who plays one of the partners.  It was nominated for numerous other awards, including Best Direction, Best Writing, Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress.  In its focus of the life of cops on the street it can be compared to some of the best American productions: HILL STREET BLUES, HOMICIDE, THE WIRE, LAW AND ORDER. This boxed DVD set, which I received for review, consists of three discs containing ten episodes running approximately 447 minutes, with a bonus 20 minute behind-the-scenes featurette, and, thank goodness, subtitles, for those of us not too familiar with Canadian English.  But be minded, if you have children or are sensitive to such things, it also contains coarse language, graphic violence, sexual content, nudity, disturbing images.

Montreal Police officers Nick Barron, (Adrian Holmes, ARROW), and Ben Chartier, (Jared Keeso, ELYSIUM), have been thrust into an unwilling partnership after the devastating shooting of Barrons last partner. Montreal-raised, urbanized Nick carries the guilty weight of that shooting with him every day, he knows he should have called for backup; isn't planning on committing to the new partner forced on him. Chartier, newest member of the rather surprisingly good-looking squad,  an overzealous country boy fresh to the city. Yet they patrol the sometimes brutal and unforgiving streets of their Montreal precinct, the 19th where domestic disputes, drug addicts, rapists, gang-members, murderers, are every day dangers.  So for better or worse, they know you need someone whos got your back.

We are privileged to watch as the wary new partners respond to some of the citys most violent, bizarre crimes, learn the high cost of life on the force, on and off duty. This award-winning production is absorbing, authentic, powerful, with an outstanding ensemble cast of sharp, but little-known beyond-the-borders-of-their-country Canadian actors.  We see the first responders whose duty it is to protect the public beyond the crime scenes at work, follow them home into their own messy lives.  It is well-written, well-paced and acted, compelling viewing, had us in this house binge-watching and hungry for more.",1461196800,10,2590,5.401985111662531
7565089,5,B0197DPAM8,"Akin to Scott & Bailey but with male leads. More of a modern Montreal precinct soap opera than a cop investigation series. Copy in & out of uniform- & beds. As much Lets roll in beds as squad cars. Primary focus is Patrolmen Nick Barron and Ben Chartier (pronounced Shaw-tay). Downtowns 19th district and these 2 men in patrol car #2 = 19-2. Youll get to know their comrades, men and women, personal relations, men to women; and Station 19s w to m & w to w. There are crimes, shootings, blood, fights, and etc action, but the focus is on the lowest rung of the crime fighters and their daily life dramas. Not all ends well.
Must be watched in order because some plot threads carry on, some throughout the entire season. And beyond. Unfinished threads at the end lowered my review to fractions below a perfect 5, but when rounding it off 5-stars it is. Beauty pageant beautiful must be a criterion for Montreal female cops.

Accomplished actors in the Canada realm, some being seen for the first time in the USA. The box warning of language, violence, content, nudity, and disturbing image should be believed.
SDH SUBTITLES for episodes and the film bonus. No titles, only numbers for chapter headings on the DVD.

==2== Nicks past yet haunts & hinders. Does Ben have a girlfriend? A vandalism patrol call gets life threatening.
==3== Commander Gendron reminds patrols that First of the month Welfare Day incites a crime wave & domestic situations.

==5== Ben takes R&R from Montreal to see Catherine. Nick gets partnered with J.M. by car number only.
==6== Ben and Nick are central in a gang war. Abandoned kids are a team project. Ben meets Nick's sis Amelie.
==7== Nick and Ben clash anew-not to mention a romantic relationship kept secret. Another physical relationship is hot/cold/hot; added to a troubled teen son, Theo. A case ends in a blast.
==8== Station 19 kidnapper search results from an Amber Alert. Isabelle-Nick-Audrey prove 3s a crowd. Nick and partner Bens sis, Amelie, social partnering continues.
==9== An ambushed 19-cop takes precedence over the Nick/Ben conflict about Amelie.
==10== A 19-team leak? Beatrice/Tyler patrol car accident? SQ (Security of Quebec) special investigation. Exploding auto. A 19-team loss. A packed episode-but its not over-not a tidy ending.
19-2 is already airing its 3rd season, so hopefully the second DVD season will appear sooner than later.",1460073600,7,2645,4.930493273542601
7565090,5,B0197DPAM8,"A new police procedural series,  19-2, is a Canadian show that has hit its prime. This series streamed from Acorn, is more about the characters than some of the crime. However, I found it exceptionally good. Give yourself two to three episodes to allow yourself a feel for what is going on.

Taking place in Montreal, 19-2, refers to the precinct and squad car number. The two major characters are Nick Barron, played by Adrian Holmes. He has returned from leave after an incident where his partner was shot in the head and is now incapacitated. Nick realizes he should have called for reinforcements during a shootout with a gang. His fellow policemen are wary around him, Nick is quick to anger and no one wants to partner with him. However, a newcomer, Ben Chartier, played by Jared Leeso, comes to the unit from a suburb in Quebec. Nick wants to ride alone, his superiors say no, and assign Ben to partner him. They start out with great reluctance, and we have a chance to get to know both of them.

We also pick up on the rest of the team. Lots of romance, drinking and off times are shown. The crimes are the same as any city. Many of them surround the various gangs, but they also assist with domestic disputes, a naked man in a laundromat, and birthday party gone wild. This series centers on a regular patrol unit, it's team and superiors.

The writing is superb, the storylines gripping and present the lives of the various police members. This is not a flashy unit, but a picture of law enforcement day to day. It does help that most of the characters are good looking.

Recommended. prisrob 02-26-16",1456444800,9,1611,4.541379310344827
7565091,5,B0197DPAM8,"Sometimes you read a review that makes you wonder if you and the reviewer were watching the same show. The anonymous review of 19-2 from the other day is that kind of thing. Like that reviewer, I've been watching 19-2 on Acorn, but my view could not be more unlike theirs. Aside from the fact that ""bad even by Canadian standards"" is a strange thing to say when you think about the quality shows that have come out of Canada like Slings & Arrows and (even though it wasn't to my taste) Durham County, 19-2 is a show that reminds me of nothing so much as the 1990s series Homicide: Life on the Street.

That assessment holds true as far as both the feel of the show and its quality. Like any show that sticks with you, it comes down to the characters. More than almost any police drama before that time, Homicide let you get to know its characters as people. Sure they were flawed, but they also tended to be fundamentally decent and - most important of all for a drama - interesting to watch. This very much holds true for 19-2.

I don't want to give away plot elements, but one element where the show is able to outdo its spiritual predecessor is being able to develop ongoing stories in a way US network series seldom could back in the 1990s. The best thing about the show from from my perspective is that there are at least two more seasons after this, which Acorn will hopefully release sooner instead of later.",1455235200,13,1415,4.356060606060606
7565092,2,B0197DPAM8,"I watched this on my Acorn subscription.  It is pretty bad even by Canadian standards.  The acting in Canadian series is always stilted.  Cliche situations all handled in a cliche way and not done very well at all.  If you want to look at pretty faces and muscled bodies, this is for you.  It you want to be entertained and not be able to guess what happens in the next 3 episodes, you need to look elsewhere.",1455148800,3,409,4.259740259740259

7565097,5,B0197DPAM8,"Excellent! The acting, writing, directing and story lines are terrific. I just binge watched Seasons 1 and 2 on Acorn TV. Looking forward to Season 3. The comparisons, others have made, to Homicide: Life on the Street and Scott & Bailey are appropriate. Also, as others have said -- it is important to view them in order. Might need to watch the 1st couple of episodes of Season 1 before you are hooked.",1474070400,,403,4.534246575342466
7565098,5,B0197DPAM8,This series is the best police procedural I've seen in a long time.  I've watched Seasons 1 & 2 (no spoilers here) on DVD and can't wait to see Season 3.  The realistic tone of each episode reminds me of other favorite series such as The Wire and The Night Of.  Episodes are not self-contained.  There is a continuing mystery in each season which mostly wraps up by Episode 10.  There is continuity between the seasons. I recommend viewing each season and episode in order.  Don't miss this series.,1472774400,2,498,4.53932584269663

Since I'm in the States, I have to wait to see season 3 on Acorn tv (thru amazon). Have been buying DVDs for all my friends and relatives to watch. Well worth the purchase. I've watched Two on Acorn but I'm buying it when it comes out in August. Buy it!",1466294400,5,349,3.9295774647887325
7565102,2,B0197DPAM8,"The insertion of fantasy scenes in the various episodes is annoying and very poorly executed. These are scenes an actor imagines rather than ones that actually take place in the drama. The filmmakers fail to provide essential cues viewers require to distinguish between what's real and what's imagined. Good filmmakers provide enough subtle cues (that are visual, aural, or both) so that we know what's happening without rewinding and re-viewing, sometimes repeatedly. In 19-2, there are no cues whatsoever. Such highly distracting scenes break the flow of the narrative and impede revelation of plot. But, in addition, fantasy scenes of this quality make far too many real scenes suspect in the mind of the viewer. Is what I'm seeing now real? Or is it imagined?

In the Tudors, an extremely fine series spanning years, fantasy scenes were inserted on very rare occasions. But there were always cues to indicate that these were purely imaginary.",1463875200,,946,5.142857142857143
8744320,2,B0197DPAM8,"One and done.  I managed to get through two-thirds of the first season and am totally bewildered as to how this series ever received so many very positive reviews.

8744323,5,B0197DPAM8,"Love this show. The writing and acting are exceptional. Love the cinematography, too. This show doesn't focus on unsolved crimes. It's more about the characters and their complicated lives. They're patrollers - so they don't spend much time at crime scenes, anyway.",1501372800,,265,5.333333333333333
8744324,5,B0197DPAM8,"Love, love this show.  I have watched seasons 1-3 multiple times.  It is just so good on so many levels.  Sometimes sad, sometimes funny but always top notch performances by a young, talented cast.  Obviously being a beat cop isn't always adrenalin pounding stuff, although there is plenty of that too.  What the series does so well is to portray cops as people like us, warts and all, teasing and fussing.  foibles, faults, personal relationship issues (boy do they have those), anger issues, family issues.  For me it is compelling viewing. I started watching Season 1, espisode 1 and there was a shooting right off the mark.  'Watched maybe a total of 5 minutes before deciding it wasn't for me.  But about a month later decided to give it another go and was seriously, seriously hooked.  I will watch all 30 episodes again (for the 8th time) before it hits Acorn TV -- and before I buy the 4 sets.  I'm an old woman, well past just about everything, but I can still admire fine looking men and Jared and Adrian fill the bill.",1500508800,,1029,4.538043478260869
