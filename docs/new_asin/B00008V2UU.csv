1862270,5,B00008V2UU,"""Trap Them and Kill Them"" aka Emmanuelle and the Last Cannibals is simply put the best of the cannibal exploitation genre and for a good reason. The plot is very simple, starts in New York, and ends up in the cannibal infested tropics, on a forbidden island. Sexy Laura Gemser is the investigative reporter who must find out what is going on with the strange symbol found on the victim in NYC. The jungle adventures are absolutley erotic, as everyone is constantly jumping each others bones. Including Gemser, and the sexy young blonde. That is until they run smack into the cannibals, and are inevitably captured, tortured, and eaten. Well, except for the sexy little blonde, who is stripped naked, and, well um, lets just say the cannibals had ""other"" ideas for her. Emmanuelle, however, is on the way, and to the rescue! Laura Gemser is without a doubt, one of the sexiest women in the world, of all time. She has an exotic look to her that is an incredible mixture of Native American, Polynesian, and Asian. She had long legs that stretched to eternity long before Stacy Keibler hit the WWE. And a belly you could bounce a quarter off of. She simply, WAS sex. Sensual, exotic, and every inch a woman. This film was LONG overdue on DVD, except that I am still having trouble tracking down a copy, but I'll get one if it's the last thing I do. Me me Lai of ""Jungle Holocaust"" fame is a razor close second, but Gemser wins in the end. Lets say it here, the absolute queen of 70's exploitation. All Hail Gemser!",1063065600,44,1511,4.518248175182482

1862272,5,B00008V2UU,"This is really one of the best Joe D'Amato Black Emanuelle classics there is. The best is Emanuelle in America, but I saw this one first, and it was superb. Really a great classic. The first 15 minutes is a sort of intro to the story of the film, then the next 45 minutes are full of good soft-core sex scenes, were Joe really proves himself. And the last 30 minutes are full of Horror and good cannibalistic scenes. Joe D' Amato is to me the genius of Italian Porn, Erotic and horror films. He's a real genius. I've got a lot of his movies: Emanuelle In America, Emanuelle and the last Cannibals , Porno Holocaust , Erotic Nights of the Living Dead , Caligula; the untold story , Beyond the Darkness , Death Smiled At Murder and Anthropophagus (The Grim Reaper).

1862274,5,B00008V2UU,"This is a great, fun film.  Once this finally arrives, my cannibal film collection will be complete.  But here is where my frustration begins.  First, back in early April I noticed a used copy of this available for 25 bucks.  That's pretty decent for a rare oop film.  Then after a month of waiting, my order is canceled from Amazon's end due to a lack of availability.  So I go to movies unlimited.  They had a copy for $24 and now it's gone and so is the listing for the film.  I check Diabolik dvd, they don't have it.  CD universe, not available and withdrawn.  retromedia out of stock without any guarantee of restocking.  Trash Palace doesn't have it.  Ioffer only makes it available as a DVDR and no I don't go for those, the quality and replayability of DVDRs are bad.  I come across another rare movie website I forgot the name to and had a copy.  I ordered it, I think it was for $35 and waited another month just to get notified it has been cancelled by them because they didn't have it after looking.  I looked at the Amazon. UK website and they had it but only for a translated value of $90.  I come back here and finally Bookgrove has one for $45.  I finally caved in and spend yes $45 for one dvd.  I do not want to miss out on owning this film.  It seems like a blu-ray edition was planned, but then was stopped, like someone or something is trying to bury this film out of existence.  I don't like that.  Every film deserves to be seen.  Bookgrove has shipped the film and it's delivery is certainly taking it's time.  Probably the dvd will show up on the last day of the windowed delivery estimate.  It's just tantalizing me, it has taken me four months to obtain a copy of this film, the longest it's ever taken for any film I've searched for and if it takes longer than the delivery estimate it might be the final nail in the coffin to sever my business from online shopping forever.  Please try and understand, I like to collect rare and hard to find films, and this one takes the cake.",1346976000,2,2007,4.259946949602122
1862275,3,B00008V2UU,"A female journalist named Emmanuelle is sent to South American to investigate the last existing cannibal tribe ever known to man. She brings a crew of misfits with her on her dangerous journey even if she has to do it with the male crew members and will the cannibals eat them all especially Emmanuelle?

One of the most gruesomest and sleaziest films in the cannibal genre from Italy but very enjoyable. Yes the acting sucks but there is some gruesome scenes of cannibalism and gore such as nipple eating, castration, genital stabbing, torso ripping etc. and what's refreshing for some viewers is that it tones down on the usual use of actual animals getting killed on film with the exception of a live Python getting shot in the head. Though not nearly as hard to watch as ""Cannibal Holocaust"" but almost near the status of that flick, it's close but no cigar when it comes near ""Cannibal Holocaust"".

The DVD has decent picture in widescreen format with a few extras like trailer with other Shriek Show trailers and a still gallery. Nevertheless it's still worth working if your into gore and sleaze movies.

1862276,5,B00008V2UU,"Emanuelle is back! More EROTIC & EXOTIC than ever! Emanuelle and the Last Cannibals (1984) Directed by Joe D'Amato (Aristide Massaccesi). Starring the cast of Laura Gemser and Gabriele Tinti amongst many others.

Joe D'Amato (Aristide Massaccesi) was born on December 15, 1936, in Rome and died in Rome, Italy because of a heart attack. The last film that D'Amato was working on befoe his death, was a movie called ""PLANKTON"" (1995). That was supposed to be about a group of young divers that become infected with a 'virus' which results in rape and bloody mayhem the way only Joe can do it.

A gruesome cannibalistic slaying at a New York hospital sends the beautiful investigative journalist Emmanuelle (Laura Gemser) into a steamy jungle inferno to track down the last existing cannibal tribe!

1862278,5,B00008V2UU,"This film is a great Cannibal film, very good story great effects and plenty to entertain.  Get this now.",1178928000,4,105,4.526315789473684
1862279,3,B00008V2UU,"I first saw ""Emanuelle and the Last Cannibals"" (""Emanuelle e gli ultimi cannibali"") in Paris along the Champs-lyse, where it was playing under the title ""Viol dans les Tropiques,"" in the early 1980s.  It was the first time that I had ever heard of the film's star, Laura Gemser, whose cinnamon-skinned, statuesque beauty leaves me at a loss for superlatives.

As delivery systems for Gemser's eye-popping pulchritude, her films are worth parades, confetti, and a twenty-one-gun salute.  But aesthetically speaking, the films themselves are poorly made.  Joe D'Amato, maker of ""Cannibals"" and the director with whom Gemser is most closely associated, is more notable for his sensationalistic subject matter than his handling of a movie camera (the same cannot be said of Russ Meyer).

But trying to warn audiences away from Laura Gemser films because they're poorly made is about as useful as warning people away from Hagen-Dazs because its fattening.  Most viewers don't go to a Gemser movie to see a well-made film; they go to see a rapturously beautiful woman get herself into one sexual situation after another.  On this level, ""Emanuelle and the Last Cannibals"" probably won't disappoint its core audience.  However, the film is notable for its use of nudity in one scene.

In this otherwise schlocky and cheesy exploitation movie, when the youngest member of an Amazon safari is kidnapped by South American cannibals, Laura/Emanuelle strips out of her clothes, pretends to be the cannibals' fertility goddess, and spirits the young kidnap victim away from her captors.

What I liked about the scene (when I could ignore the condescending portrayal of the ""cannibals"") was that Emanuelle's nudity became an agent of her personal power. The cannibals were so in awe of her naked body, and the confidence with which she wielded it, that they surrendered their prisoner to her.  In one of those rare moments in the movies, a woman's nakedness was not a mark of vulnerability or victimization -- but of strength. And the natives yielded to the erotic aura and power of her unadorned female form. In fact, the cannibals' awe of Laura Gemser's naked body mirrored my own.

Also, immersing myself into the story, I got an electric charge out of the idea that a beautiful woman would deliberately drop trou and knowingly walk into such a dangerous situation. (The film's German title is ""Nackt unter Kannibalen"" --  literally ""Naked Among the Cannibals."")  And I got another charge out of the idea that she was able to escape that situation precisely because she was nude to begin with. Never underestimate the power of the naked female body.

Gemser fans may laugh at comparing ""Emanuelle and the Last Cannibals"" to the films of Mikls Jancs, the Hungarian art-film director (""Red Psalm,"" ""Allegro Barbaro"") who also frequently uses nudity as an element of power and resistance.  But nakedness is so rarely portrayed as a symbol of strength in story-telling audiovisual media (no doubt because of nudity's taboo status in society) that thinking of similar scenes from films leaves the brain racked.

This one scene from ""Emanuelle and the Last Cannibals,"" the single moment of mesmerism in an otherwise tawdry movie, stands as a tribute to Laura Gemser and her bountiful beauty.  Jancs aside, I wish there were more scenes like this in non-sexploitation cinema.",1099267200,42,3357,5.072727272727272
1862280,5,B00008V2UU,"This film was excellent. Me and my fiance bought it along with a bunch of other slasher films and found it to not only contain gore but also the interspersed softcore porn was a bonus!!
Not only that but it also had a smoking monkey in it as well - awesome.",1090195200,7,257,4.0588235294117645
1862281,3,B00008V2UU,"That pesky minx, Emanuelle, has met her match this time!  Now she's dealing with a vicious(what other kind?) tribe of cannibals, along with some other unfortunate souls.  Joe D'Amato tries to weasel in on Lenzi/Deodato's territory, but adding his own personal touch.  In this case, he tries a marriage of gory Italian style cannibal flick and softcore porno.  Emanuelle manages to hit on, and/or sleep with just about every man and woman in this film-A Real Party Chick!  What else could you ask for when you're on a perilous trek through cannibal territory?  Laura Gemser is extraordinarily sexy, if you didn't already know.  Basically, the first hour of the film is dedicated to all the characters exploring each other rather than the Amazon.  There are four female characters and 3 of them(one is a nun, but even she's not safe from a nude scene) seem to have the hormones of a 17 year old guy.  After this rather unexciting hour the cannibals decide to crash the party.  There's alot of nipple eating in this film.  I'm not sure why this is the cannibals' first choice before they dig into the rest.  I guess they see them as hors d'oeuvres or something.  I'm not quite sure if I like the mixing of genres all that much-I guess I's prefer strictly one or the other.  It's not bad though;  It still makes for goodtime, sleazy midnight viewing, which is all you can expect from Italian horror cinema.  One bizarre scene is worth the price of admission alone:  Emanuelle and some other lady are bathing naked in a river while a chimpanzee sits onshore watching them, clapping and smoking a cigarette.  Funny.",1077148800,20,1609,4.706093189964157
7986928,4,B00008V2UU,"I bought this because I read that it was something of an influence on Ruggero Deodato's 'Cannibal Holocaust' which sort of stands today as like the artistic pinnacle of grindhouse filmaking, and I just wanted it as part of my 'Cannibal Boom' collection.

Right out of the mailer, if you got the limited edition slipcased version, you find out that the thing is really snug around the bluray case.  It takes some jimmying to get the thing out of it without tearing the fancy-schmancy slipcase.  This was also true with Severin's recent release of 'Eaten Alive!' so...that's no fun.  It's hard to get it in and out of the slipcase without tearing it.  The bluray case is nice glossy black plastic instead of the standard translucent blue which I hate, so that's good.

The movie itself is supposed to have been 'remastered from vault elements'.  I don't know what kind of leaky basement vault they found these 'elements' in, but this 2k version doesn't look all that great.  Maybe D'Amato and co. just couldn't afford very good film stock for this c-grader or the vault elements were copies of copies; it looks like what it is, though, a cheap sleazy grindhouse movie.  Sometimes these older movies get re-mastered into looking like they were shot yesterday; this is not the case here.  It's fairly grainy and at one point the picture snaps out and you're seeing a split second of burned out film flitting across the screen.  Every shadow is pitch black, every bright color is washed out, every medium earth tone is rich and oversaturated.  Luckily, since the beautiful Miss Gemser has so much skin on display, the rich earth tones make for a nice touch.

The 'influence on Cannibal Holocaust' is debatable.  There was a brief segment where Emanuelle and her new lover Professor Lester watch footage of cannibals in Tanzania doing what they do.  The basis of the story is that Emanuelle is a hard-nosed journalist doing a gritty piece about chaos in the Amazon, which was sort of the basis for the fictional documentary portrayed in Holocaust.  In Holocaust, though, the cannibals come off as somewhat docile until they're riled up by the interloping documentarians; in this, apparently a tribe that was thought to be wiped out resurfaces and goes after anyone and anything that crosses their path.  It's hinted at that something might have happened to anger this tribe previous to the films opening but that is not really explored/explained later.  Really, 'Emanuelle and the Last Cannibals' is just an excuse to get a lot of actors into an exotic location in order to remove their clothes.

Gripes about movie: Every jungle native shown in the movie is a cannibal and every cannibal is a male in a loincloth, even when they're shown in their own island village.  Maybe what the tribe is so angry about is that all the women in the tribe left?  Emanuelle's young blonde friend is rather graphically molested in her sleep by a stranger they meet in the jungle.  She wakes up, alerts her friends and a fight ensues.  The stranger wins the fight and afterwards the film goes on as if the molestation and fight had never happened.

D'Amato does deliver on some solid, if somewhat cheap looking, gore moments.  The cinematography gets pretty wild at times.  The sex scenes are softcore, often with the male participant forgetting to remove (or even unzip) their pants prior to penetrative sex but then that's putting the grind in grindhouse.

The extras consist mainly of the theatrical trailer and interviews with a lot of the major players.  The video interviews are fairly long and all in subtitled Italian with the interviewees expounding at great length upon their long storied careers in which, for the most part, it would seem this film was but a footnote.

You can watch the movie with English or Italian dialogue with English subtitles on or off.  The English subtitles are written to follow the Italian dialogue so they don't read at all similar to what's being said on the screen with dubbed in English.  Also, the dubbing overall is kinda awful.  The Italian dialogue was very fast-paced so, for instance, when Emanuelle's sitting around a campfire talking about something, in Italian she'd be saying, ""I did this so I want this and now I'm gonna do this.  Later I will do other things.""  Dubbed into English it sounds like ""I did this....so I want this.....and now I'm gonna.....do this and....more.""  That's not a line from the movie, but it's an example of how the dub-job didn't work.  At one point where Emanuelle is supposed to be telling someone ""I won't hurt you"" the dubbed in English has her stating simply ""Hurt you.""  If you prefer your sleazy 70s cannibal movies to have remotely believable performances from the actors, I'd recommend watching this one in Italian with the English subtitles on.  Or off if you can understand Italia.  Good for you!

The soundtrack cd is pretty awesome with Nico Fidenco's lush 70s softcore sounds and synthed up scary jungle atmosphere cues.  It's 30 tracks long and sounds a lot better than the sound in the movie itself.  Lots of good moody stuff.  I suppose this is pretty comparable to Holocaust in the sense that it's got a great soundtrack.",1526083200,,5198,4.793258426966292

7986935,3,B00008V2UU,"I'm grading this film on a bit of a curve here -- I'm assuming that if you're reading this, you're familiar with the Exploitation genre (and may even know the work of director Joe D'Amato).  But I should start with a quick caveat:  this is the Italian version of [Black] Emanuelle, not to be confused with the French film series Emmanuelle.  The French series is stylized erotica, and the star associated with the role is Sylvia Kristel.  In this film, please understand that -- yes, there is plenty of nudity, but those scenes are going to share screentime with acts of violence that are aimed to shock.

With all that said, I'm giving the film three stars.  The way the sex scenes are juxtaposed against the cannibalism scenes is kind of jarring, although I suppose that's the intention.  But I never really came away thinking that the horror aspect of the film *worked*.  In a B-movie like this, the cannibalism scenes should have done one of three things.  They either should have genuinely scared me, or genuinely grossed me out, or been so cartoonish that I was amused.  It's very rare to accomplish more than one of those tasks in the same film, and D'Amato just didn't have that kind of budget to work with.  So he really should have focused on generating one of those emotions.  Unfortunately, it was like he was trying to hit the center of the Venn diagram to produce all three sensations at once, and in doing so, it's like they had no effect at all -- I was just kind of numb through every cannibal encounter.  Except for one scene with a character who was tortured to death by being cut in half.  The special effects for his death scene were laughably bad.

The softcore scenes were much better, although the titular character (portrayed by the GORGEOUS Laura Gemser) goes surprisingly absent for long stretches of film.

The bottom line is that there are better Emanuelle films out there (like Emanuelle in America), and there are better Joe D'Amato horror/exploitation films (like Buio Omega).",1420761600,2,2008,4.694285714285714

The movie is exactly what the title says. It has graphic cannibalism, in gory detail, intermixed with sex scenes. Why the producers thought they could put human cannibalism together with sex is far beyond my comprehension. There is nothing vaguely erotic about this movie. The plot is nonexistent, and the acting terrible, and is that the best I can say about it. It has nothing to do with the other Emmanuelle movies whatever.

I got about halfway through it, to a graphic cannibalism scene, when I took it out of the DVD player, and put it in a trash can, piling garbage on top of it. Frankly, the rotting, stinking garbage could only improve it. Do NOT buy!!!!!!!
