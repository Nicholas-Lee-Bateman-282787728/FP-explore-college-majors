2926571,5,B000UX6TLG,"I own season 1 and now season 3. I will be purchasing season 2 in the future. I found on DVD Donkey.com a full series seasons 1-4. I don't know as to what the quality is since season 4 has not been released

I do not really have a analytical analaysis of this delightful series, I can only give you my opinion of a show that brings back memories of a simplier time when there were shows that had meaningful messages of life and a somewhat innocence in nature.

Mork and Mindy is one of those shows. I believe its success primarily was about its innocence and brand of comedy for all audiences

Of cource the hilarious comedy Robin Williams and the chemisrty he had with Pam Dawber was easy to witness

I also noticed with this show I have not read in other reviews was its construction of I believe only 2 commercial breaks during its airing. I have a difficult time watching todays shows which I believe are constructed around the commercials.

Anyway Mork and Mindy is truly a delightful comedy series with just the right amount of adult entertainment while keeping light and innocent in nature the whole family can enjoy.",1199577600,10,1124,4.490196078431373
2926572,5,B000UX6TLG,"Because the initial allusions to `interracial' co-habitation were loosing some `shock value', the series production team refocused storylines on Mork and Mindy as a romantic couple (""Mindy, Mindy, Mindy"", ""Mork, the Swinging Single"") this season. They are moving from friends to `friends'----and quite smoothly!

However, Mork wasn't supposed to ever become too acclimated to earth (Putting the Ork back in Mork I, II). So, in order to successfully complete his mission, he is required to remember his extraterrestrial heritage. It's also the studio's way of acknowlleging that deleting Fred and Cora from the cast had been a mistake, and gennuine attempts were being made to repair things--such as the series Nielsen ratings.

As it turns out, Mork's reports have been so popular (regardless of whom he interacts with on Earth) that other Orkians want his job (""There's a new Mork in Town""). And can we really blame them! Aside from being an observer, Mork is a compassionate being who sincerely tries to help anything he thinks is hurting, even a chimp (""Mork, The Monkey's Uncle"")

Pam Dawber gives another awesome lead performance in ""Mindy Gets a Job"".  Fate requires her--with some assistance from Mork--to unexpectedly perform the local newscast as a solo gig. A blizzard conveniently prevents all of the old pros from getting to the station. So, there is nothing like the present to demonstrate that she has the competence necessary to successfully make it as a professional journalist. Episodes like these easily remind me why I had looked up to Mindy as a young girl--and now continue doing so; she remained both pretty and professional---even in a crisis.

Gender is again brought up in ""Mork and Mindy Meet Rick and Ruby"". Remo has decided that he does not want a pregnant singer who is part of a performing duo. Although the Pregnancy Non-discrimination Act had just been passed, years earlier in 1978, this was still a very topical issue for the viewing audience. The usually sophisticated Remo genuinely had convinced himself that pregnant women should not be working, lest they get `hurt'!  Undaunted, Mindy convinces Remo to hire her back--and Mork enthusiastically fills in when she DOES go into labor on stage. Williams has a charming singing voice.

Mork himself continues not to get offended by the 70's ever-shifting gender mores. To bring extra money into their apartment, he is happily working at a local daycare center. This suits such a `different guy' perfectly because childcare worker historically has been something which gets performed by women. And Mork is devoted to the point where he participates in a fundraising race for the kids (""Dueling Skates"")  in addition to helping them learn about the importance of non-violence (""Gunfight at the Mork-ay Corral"").

But because Mindy's increased work schedule does make him lonely, he suggests they switch places (""Mindy and Mork"") ultimately discovering they both have very busy lives. There is no such thing as `unimportant work'. But there is unpleasant work in ""I Heard it Through the Morkvine"" when Mindy successfully convinces Mr. Sternhagen that TV gossip's initially high ratings become outweighed by long-term traumatic effects it visits on the community.  Having weathered the onslaught of tabloid TV and now `reality television' I can't emphasize how accurately prophetic this one episode was. Wow!

This usually lighthearted sitcom made both a very noticeable mood and scripting departure with ""Mork Meets Robin Williams"". You-know-who does double duty as himself.  For `some reason', people think that Mork looks like Robin Williams who for the sake of this episode is just in town doing stand-up routines!

However, the real memorable scene during this episode--and season comes during his weekly report to Orson. Talking about the burdens inadvertently created by celebrity hood, Mork rattles off a list of celebrities who died too early--cracking when he mentions John Lennon and then suddenly fading out as opposed to giving the usual witty closing.

Given the episode's airing two months after Lennon's assassination, I am assuming that this individual improvisation was not intentional. And the emotion which Williams publically did exhibit must have required a great deal of internal self-control rather than breaking down all together on screen. This one ending still gives me the chills and I am not even old enough to have remembered the Beatles together and performing. This one episode alone is why the season warranted five stars hands down.

The only thing which really bugged me was the lack of extras--and the flimsy cases. I realize this show was not an enormous phenomenon; but technology does exist for better DVD cases--and other companies have proven their ability to put out non-classic shows lasting one season in better and still low-budget cases.",1198540800,20,4863,5.224646983311938

2926574,4,B000UX6TLG,"ABC's MORK & MINDY's third season in 1980-81 began unusually late due to an actors' strike that began around July 1980 and ended about two months later. Robin Williams had just wrapped up filming his first starring film POPEYE,the breakthrough of his film career. I incorrectly mentioned in the review for the season 2 set that Mindy's(Pam Dawber) father Fred(Conrad Janis),a music store proprietor,had gone on the road to conduct for a symphony tour this season. Actually,Fred is back this season and still running the store. His mother or mother-in-law Cora(Elizabeth Kerr) returns to Boulder,Colorado also. Mork(Williams) and Mindy are still living together and are such great friends.

2926654,5,B000UX6TLG,"The supporting cast continued to shuffle around. By this third season most actors used before are used again. I know there are only four seasons and that the fourth will have a baby (but in true ORK tradition of using an adult). Thus, I can see in this season that the romance aspect is heating up. There is only so far in prime time tv in the late 1970s early 1980s that one can go with a romance heating up, however. They definitely seem more and more a couple and there is more kissing and hugging. He still sleeps up in the attic though and she still stays in her bedroom.

As for the action itself, Mork is front and center again with many imaginative twists. I particularly liked the roller skating contest which Mork entered. I also like his working in day care with children. It seems ideal for his character. He also plays a real square in the opening episode as Orson discovers he's got the disease of turning into an earthling without Ork intervention. This square episode is especially good because he is as unMorklike as it it possible to be. He's a bigger nerd than Ty Burrell in ""Modern Family"" for this episode! There is an episode with Mork and a Chimp and Williams is really good with animals. He also can make the same sounds as an animal. There is a Western episode where he acts out a shoot out with a little kid and let's his John Wayne riffs play out. There is also an episode with a mental patient who thinks he is Peter Pan. Mork breaks him out of the asylum. They all take turns crowing like a rooster which was a big part of the musical version of ""Peter Pan"" in the tune, ""I Want to Crow."" Naturally Robin Williams can crow like a rooster better than any other actor. The most poignant episode is when Mork meets Robin Williams who is in town to do a benefit stand up show. You really do think they are two different people yet parts of one another. The most versatile episode is when Mork dances with a woman friend of Mindy's sort of like Fred Astaire but without the tux. He has to actually pull off the dance plus pull off a parody of the dance.  He does both. It is incredible.

In many ways this was an ideal outlet for Robin Williams' talent. He could do just about anything he wanted and he got to do it weekly. TV has this immediacy or communication which movies do not. Unfortunately, by the time he returned to series tv in his 60s, he was just too drained with illness and life problems to have the energy necessary for sustaining a weekly series. They are brutal to shoot for network and would be very hard on a senior with health problems.

2926656,5,B000UX6TLG,"This season got them back a little closer to the first season magic, that ABC screwed up in season two.  Mork was, well Mork this season.  The magic wasn't all the way back, but most of the laughs were.  I love having Fred and Grandma back this season (unfortunately, Elizabeth Kerr only guest stars I one episode; I'll take over not having her at all).  They were most definitely part of the magic that made season one so great.  I hope whoever's idea it was to get rid of them for season two got his or her butt fired.

Some of my favorite episodes are the premiere episode, Putting the Ork Back in Mork; Mork in Never-Never Land, featuring the great guest star David Spielberg; Mork Meets Robin Williams, where Robin Williams Guest Stars as himself!  Also my favorite Old Muggable Mork, featuring Grandma's guest appearance.

I'm an avid (okay, rabid) collector of past TV shows (and movies and more) and see most pretty much sadly repeat their
schtick tricks sadly over and over ad nauseam NOT SO for Master Comic Williams. His high humorous wit don'dim abit.

8215483,5,B000UX6TLG,"One of my favorite 70s TV series and the only one to star the wonderful Robin Williams as an alien named Mork from Ork, ""sent to Earth to observe your primitive society"" and report back to Orson, his superior (whom we hear but never really see) on Ork.  In the 3rd season, he's still living la vida loca with platonic girl-friend Mindy (Pam Dawber) in the attic of her apartment.  For some reason, since it went out of syndication and was no longer shown anywhere on cable that I've been able to find for the last decade or more, I had been thinking there were only three seasons to this show and the third one was the one where they finally married and had an adult child played by Jonathan Winters, but that turns out to be the 4th season; this one has some of the best episodes of the too-short-lived series, and is apparently the source for the majority of the clips seen in the opening credits for the first three seasons.

My favorites from this season: ""Putting the Ork Back in Mork"" (the two-part season opener in which Mork from Ork has become ""Morrie of Earth"", cut his hair, started dressing like Pat Boone and generally acting more human than Orkan; missing the original, quirky Mork, Mindy helps an Elder called in from Ork perform the title activity for Mork), ""I Heard it Through the Morkvine"" (in which Mork tries to help Mindy out in her new job at a local TV station by handling a new gossip segment on her news show, which results in dirt being dished on Mindy and all their friends), and the most poignant episode in the whole series, ""Mork Meets Robin Williams"" (Mindy is ordered to get an interview with Robin Williams, who has a local tour stopover, and after many near-misses and much effort on Mindy's part, they finally get into Robin's dressing room and he gives him an interview; this is followed by a very candid discussion of Robin's inability to say no and other personal revelations, capped by Mork's usual report to Orson at the end where he talks about how many celebrities can't deal with the ramifications of fame--and starts listing off examples [mainly, at that time, musicians]...I can't help mentally adding Robin Williams' name at the end.)

If you like Robin Williams but not the R-rated language of his night-club act, you will love this series, the vehicle that made him a TV/movie star.  It's hilarious, poignant and well worth the price.",1469318400,,2383,4.597647058823529
8215484,5,B000UX6TLG,Robin Williams at his zany best.,1467417600,,32,4.5
8215485,4,B000UX6TLG,It's tragic that robin Williams is gone but at least we still have treasures like this to remember him by. This show is absolutely hilarious and timeless. Robin Williams is laughable and love able as Mork. And he's perfectly paired with Mindy. An amazing side note to the show released after it wrapt was that most of Morks attitudes and antics were improv. Talk about talent. This show will make you laugh cry and hold your loved ones close,1457395200,,441,4.594936708860759
