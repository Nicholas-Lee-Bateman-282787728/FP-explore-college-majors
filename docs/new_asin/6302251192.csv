446379,3,6302251192,"""Mad Max"" meets ""I Was a Communist for the FBI"" on Rollerblades in a time capsule of late Cold War-era apocalpytic fears. While the sets don't hold up well a decade later, the script seems surprisingly fresh and Corey Haim's performance is free of child-star smarm as he grapples with the dual loyalties of an informer. Also features a young Patricia Arquette.",1071014400,,360,4.82258064516129
446380,5,6302251192,"Well well well, how do you review a film which has obviously been written and directed by a chimp. And not one of those cool rollerskate chimps who smoke cigars, but a stinky Gregory chimp. This film is amazing you have to buy it. The premise of the story revolves around a caravan that mixes stuff. Enter Haim who skates around for a bit, followed by his friends whom all wear the same horrible jackets. The jackets designed to make them look menecing and cool, look as though a blind cat nailed to a skateboard made them. This film is the best. Where else can you see Haim ( quite litrally as he is a wash out ) go around on ""ultra cool in 91"" roller blades trying to stop a group of mullets and their caravan. No one in this film deserves to win the day, and as the film continues you wish someone would put a stick on the floor so they all fall and break their noses. You must buy this excellent film. Much better than titanic and gladiator",998352000,3,944,4.1923076923076925
446381,5,6302251192,"despite some nasty reviews i've read so far, i think that this is a great movie. It's fun, has an original storyline, and the actors performed very well, particularly Morgan Weisser (Bullwinkle) and Christopher Collet (Gary Lee)....The movie has some great skating sequences and they make you want to skate along with them....",994550400,4,326,5.169811320754717
446382,4,6302251192,"Prayer of the Rollerboys was one of the best movies.  The movie all around is about (Haim) an undercover cop, trying to make a better life for his little brother.  Also trying to bust the Rollerboys for drugs (mist).  This movie kept me very entertained.  great soundtrack, great actors, and the plot line was good.  It wasn't like all the rest of the movies out there.  It was a different story and I think thats what I liked best about it.  ITs different.  I could watch this movie everyday for the rest of my life, and never get sick of it.",993686400,2,543,4.306930693069307
446383,4,6302251192,"The first time I saw this movie, it was called ""Prayer Of The Rollerboys"", and I immediately fell in love with it. I will admit that it is not the greatest film ever, but it is very entertaining. I mean, jeez, who wouldn't wanna put on a tan trenchcoat and rollerblade around swinging your arms in synchronization with the other rollerboys? You can feel Corey's angst when he rollerblades around after a hard day's work at the pizza shop. All in all, once you sit down to watch this film, you will not be able to get up and walk away from it. It will entertain you in a way you don't expect- and that's a good thing! BUY THIS FILM! I'm gonna get a second copy to replace my old worn out copy!",980208000,,692,4.1716417910447765
446384,3,6302251192,"I like this one due to the fact that when i watched it i was well into the rollerblading scene.  Its a good movie about a guy who tries to save his little brother becoming a drug addict, on a new drug called 'mist', the  punch line is however, this drug makes the user completely impotent.  This  is a ploy from the Rollerboys themselves to make the America a better  place, after its downfall.  They call the drugs affects 'the day of the  rope'.  Corey Haim then comes into play as a hot shot rollerblader, who  needs to convert to a rollerboy to save his little bro.  By converting he  is pushed into a life of sex hungry women, and beating up innocent  civilians.  This is a good film, but it only deserves three stars due to  the fact that its quality and content and not upto todays standards, still  i urge you to buy this one.",964310400,5,834,4.222929936305732
446385,2,6302251192,"Unlike the last reviewer, I have seen this movie -- Back when it was called ""Prayer of the Rollerboys"" -- and it's pretty bad, even for post ""License to Drive"" Corey Haim.  Trust me, my husband LOVES this movie, so I've seen it a lot, mainly because I made the mistake  of buying it for him one Christmas. This is the type of flick that  Joel/Mike and the bots love to hate on MST3K.  It's like a particularly bad  train wreck, or an episode of Beavis and Butthead -- it's so horrible, but  you can't turn away from it.  You have to watch it all the way through to  its cheesy end.  The storyline is absolutely awful, rendering any acting  talent in the film quite useless.  I was particularly upset to see Patricia  Arquette in such a stinker; I usually enjoy her performance, no matter how  bad the film.  This was an exception.
Do yourself a favor -- spend that  hard-earned $ on something you'll enjoy, like ""The Lost Boys.""  Now that was Corey Haim in his prime!",957744000,6,967,4.348314606741573

446449,4,6302251192,"A classic film featuring such memorable lines as ""Griffin is now of the Dragon!"" and featuring Corey Haim at the height of his powers, it will make you want to live in a futuristic dystopia where young men in white trenchcoats get around on their 'blades' peddling an illicit drug called mist in an effort to return a fallen America to its former glory.

446451,2,6302251192,"I bought this movie because I loved ""Firstborn"" from 1984, which also
starred Christopher Collett and Corey Haim.  A user review from that film
tipped me off.  I noticed the reviews of ""Prayer..."" were terrible and
so I wasn't expecting much.  This movie is absolutely awful. But it is
rather fun and entertaining.  Unfortunately, I am getting too old to
waste 85 minutes on junk, but despite an awful script, terrible effects
for a futuristic sci-fi, and amateurish direction and performances, I
didn't hate it.  At least it moved along fast.  I can't really recommend
the movie, but if you are a fan of Collett or Haim, I guess you might
get some enjoyment out of this low budget mess.",1197072000,4,687,4.683333333333334
446452,5,6302251192,This is another great film with Corey Haim as the lead actor. This film didn't get enough attention when it came out. I love this movie because it deals with what could happen at any time in America as well as some home turf terrorism and the drug problem.,1174262400,2,256,4.244897959183674

I HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE SINCE LIKE 1996 AND I CAN'T REMEMBER IF THERE WAS LAME PARTS OR CORNY ,BUT I'M SURE THERE IS IT'S 1991 FILM MAKING.

IF IT COMES OUT ON DVD IT SHOULD BE A 10 DOLLAR MOVIE , ALONG WITH GLEAMING THE CUBE.",1123027200,4,404,3.9753086419753085
446454,5,6302251192,"...As I said this movie really isn't about rollerbladeing; that was just a tie-in to entice us. Remember when rollerblading was really popular during the early Nineties? Anyways, ""Prayer of The Rollerboys"" is about Neo-Naziism,(at least if you watch really closely) if not; then it really is just a rollerblading movie. If you pay attention very carefully you'll notice that every 'Rollerboy' is let's say white(I'm not kidding; watch for yourself). Also if you pay attention to all of Gary Lee's associates; you'll notice that one of them is Japanese and another, whom Corey Haim's character extorts money from, serves pizza(Italian reference?). And if you pay attention to the pizza parlor propietor(named Pinky) and his attitude towards the 'Rollerboys'; you'll notice a slite reference to Italy's political stance during World War II.

  The drug 'Mist' has a secret ingredient called 'Rope' which sterilizes those that use it; which is why Gary Lee doesn't want any of his 'Rollerboys' to use it. Once the weak have been sterilized only the strong will be left; hence ""Day of the Rope"". 'Rope' is the final solution to the ever plagueing problem. The only opposition the 'Rollerboys' face, aside from the police, is a rival gang called the 'B-13'. The 'B-13' is a gang consisting of every minority and then some. Remember the scene where the truck pulls in and the 'B-13' just start cappin'-off 'Rollerboys'? If you do, watch it again, and pay attention to all the peole involved in that scene. I don't know, maybe I'm just over-analizing this flick.

  I recommend this movie because if it really IS just a rollerblading movie, than it kicks ass, because it's a pretty graphic rollerblading movie(especially when Bullwinkle gets his brains splattered by that corrupt cop). If this movie really IS about what I think it is, than this movie comepletely sucks balls. Honestly; how tough does a Neo-Nazi look on rolllerblades?

Either, or, I still recommend this movie...but don't pay more than $10 for it(in any medium, i.e. DVD, Laserdisc, and God forbid, VHS). I also would like to add that this is the best movie Corey Haim has been featured in...aside from ""Lost Boys"".",1099180800,10,2176,4.994475138121547
