153395,5,0792846133,I watched this film around 15 years ago and I just purchased the DVD. It is impossible to forget such a nice-emotional and natural film even after 15 years. Maybe the best drama I have ever watched. Strictly adviced for  classical collectors.,942883200,9,242,4.761904761904762
153396,5,0792846133,"Captures the mindset of post-WWII American to a tee.  Unforgettable performances and honest, non-shlockey sentiment.  ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" shows the best and the worst qualities in all of us.",940464000,8,200,5.21875
153397,5,0792846133,"This is without doubt the finest Example of American ""Thinking"" Cinema. It Doesn't show Blood'n'Guts Hollywoodisms, instead it shows you the aftermath that confronts a Soldier, Sailor and Airman returning home,  Combat can Last Only Minutes it's affects live with you to the grave. The  Wounds both Physical and Mental are there to be seen, the Sailor played by  Harold Russell one of his only two film parts is played masterfully..no  shoving his hands ups his sleeves..he REALLY lost his hands in war..the  other cast members act out fo their skins..showing the quality of  performance that they could achieve given the right script and direction.

153398,5,0792846133,"If you have ever served in the military, you will see much of yourself in this very moving tale of how three WWII veterans adjust to a post-war life.  All face difficulties, jealousies, and awkward moments.  All become  friends.  Dana Andrews is magnificent as the Fred Derry, a one-time aviator  hero who resigns himself to returning to his job as a soda jerk.  Virginia  Mayo is superb as his wife, who fell in love with his Army uniform but has  no use for him now.  Myrna Loy and Frederick March are excellent as a long  time couple who deal squarely with his disinterest in his banking job and  their daughter's emerging love for Fred.  Harold Russell is totally  believable as the vet who loses his arms and won't burden his girl with the  inconvenience.  Theresa Wright is touching as the daughter of one veteran  and the savior of another.  They don't make films like this anymore.  I'm  afraid that the characters in current films like Good Will Hunting are  subordinated to a morbid facination with profanity and sex.  All the more  reason to get The Best Years of Our Lives.",919123200,21,1085,4.6

153427,5,0792846133,"From World War II and the Post-War years right into the 21st Century with the Middle East Global Wars, similar service-connected disabilities have a history of repetition.  This DVD, the Best Years of Our Lives, is an excellent introduction to those disabilities then and now in the present.  I know because I am a former military officer who has disabilities from overseas service in the Middle East during the 1980s.  In the movie, an Officer returns to a loveless marriage, an NCO returned to a family that grew up without him, and a Sailor returns home with both hands amputated.  The same appears in one war after another.  Whether military or a veteran World War II Battle Fatigue has re-appeared as PTSD, family problems, employment difficulties, and daily readjustments, I found this movie to be a superb introduction to search for solutions and so have other comrades who have viewed this in counseling programs.  Worthy of a five-star rating to advocate no one is alone with those service connected problems who has been in the U.S. Armed Forces.",1518652800,,1056,4.904494382022472
153428,5,0792846133,"Since my father was in WW2, I have always had an interest in that period of history. Unfortunately Hollywood's attempt to depict the war has always come up short. When I saw TBYOOL for the first time I knew I had to have a copy of it. The personalities and situations of the characters draw you in and hold on to you the entire movie. The background of the making of the movie and it's stars just makes it all the better!",1518220800,,421,4.146341463414634
153439,5,0792846133,"I've owned two (maybe three?) copies of this movie over the years. I'm a classic film buff and there aren't many films from this era that deal as openly with the issues of ""coming home"" after war like this one does. Hollywood wasn't known for going deep in 1946 but here we have a man who has to find a way back into his family's life, another trying to adjust to being treated like a nobody after having been a bomber captain, and a former sailor who has lost his arms and his confidence. I cry every time I watch it and I can only imagine what returned vets in '46 must have felt upon seeing it. It's a ""must have"" for film fans and history buffs and it deserved the awards it received.",1517356800,,688,4.141791044776119
153440,5,0792846133,"Saw this movie first when I was a teenager, fifty years ago. It left an indelible impression. Had seen it again various times over the years, and decided I needed my own copy. Can only dimly imagine the effect it would have had on returning servicemen (and their families) back in 1946.

It's been objected elsewhere that Dana Andrews was maybe ten years too old for his role as Captain Fred Derry. Perhaps so. Very likely indeed considering the USAAF bomber crew age cohort of the time, and also in comparison with the Fred Derry portrayed in Mackinlay Kantor's original prose-poem book ""Glory for Me"". But who cares? It's still probably my all-time favourite movie.",1516924800,,667,4.8

153445,5,0792846133,"This film is at the top of my list of personal favorites and is, along with Mrs. Miniver, my favorite of all William Wyler's films. If there were ever three characters that you root for it's these three guys. My favorite is Dana Andrews' character Fred. He really struggles with finding a decent job and, having had similar issues in my own life with being unskilled, I could really relate to his predicament. After fighting the war in Europe as a bombardier, helping to save civilization from tyranny, he winds up going back to the drug store where he once worked making ice cream sodas before the war. Fred also struggles with what we call PTSD today. The scenes that portray this are very moving.

Then there's Homer who lost both of his hands in the war. Homer is played by Harold Russell, a real life army veteran who lost both of his hands in an accident. No need for any Forrest Gump, CGI shenanigans here. (This non-professional actor went on to win an Academy Award for his performance.) Homer's girl Wilma still loves him despite his crushing feelings of inadequacy. The scene between Homer and Wilma, played by Cathy O'Donnell, later in the film is one of the most touching scenes in any film ever made. It simply has to be seen. Finally there's Al who struggles a bit with the bottle although this is not overplayed. In fact, and I think it's what makes it so good is that the entire film avoids turning into a sentimental cliche. It is stirring but not syrupy and it stays unpredictable and maintains subtlety throughout. It's a long film but it's so good, the time just flies by.",1514073600,3,1593,4.550522648083624

153462,5,0792846133,"I never get tired of seeing this movie regarding three servicemen returning home from World War II.

Their roles were switched during the war:  Fredric March plays Al Stephenson, an upper-class banker who was a infantry Sergeant during the war. Al returns to the bank and gets a promotion.  Dana Andrews plays Fred Derry, a lower-class drug store employee who was an Air Force Captain during the war.  Fred cannot find work except at the drug store.  Harold Russell plays Homer Parrish, a middle-class guy just out of High School who was sailor during the war.  Homer lost his hands and receives disability pay.  Myrna Loy is excellent as Al Stephenson's wife.  Unfortunately, all of the female roles are supportive in nature (1946), and include Teresa Wright and Virginia Mayo.

153479,5,0792846133,"I have seen this movie over the years many times. It is filled with all kinds of emotion as it focuses on the lives of 3 men returning from WWII not knowing what they will find once back after years away. You experience their fears, how the war changed them, how their families, loved ones react to them. They all have scars - mostly mental ones - long before we knew about PTSD - and one a physical issue that he fears will lose him the love of people he loves. It is all wrapped up in this movie and it is a towering achievement. To this day it evokes so many feelings about how people try and fit back into their lives after witnessing horrors that are unimaginable. What I have found interesting is that you feel like you are really part of their lives, that you know them and you are not just watching a movie but a real slice of life and that this could be you or your family or your friends. You care about them. It breaks that wall and draws you INTO the movie and into their lives that seem so real. It is an amazing film that is incredibly good and which can be contemporary as it shows issues that people who return from war all face no matter the generation or era. It's a must see film.",1503792000,3,1199,4.1063829787234045

It is post WWII, the three main characters are returning from War after after years of service, one of whom is Dana Andrews, another is Frederick March, and last but not least, Harold Russel, who had lost both hands in WWII, a real Veteran. Mr Russel had never acted a day in his life and he won an Oscar for his performance. As the movie begins the three men are catching flights back to the same city and they realize they have that much in common, with personal lives to pick up and rebuild, or to start over. Beautiful character development, with a deep feel of what they and their families go through as they weave the fabric of their lives back together and move on. The world had changed for these men and their families.  Dana Andrew's character had married to hastily while on a previous leave. Frederick March's children had grown into young adults, and his previous position at the bank, while fortunately still available, faced a man changed by war. The heroic Mr Russel, having hooks for hands, felt he should release his childhood sweetheart from any future plans they had dreamed of.  I bet you will watch it more than once, as I have.

The movie focuses on the inner & outer struggles of 3 men who have just returned to the United States (U.S.) from serving tours of duty overseas during World War Two (WWII). Throughout the course of the movie, each man comes to be at peace with the things he can & cannot change about his life, as a result of the war's effects on himself & others. Each of the 3 main characters gets the happiest ending of all happy endings: one man is re-united with his wife & 2 children; another meets & proposes to the woman of his dreams (she accepts his proposal, by the way); and the 3rd man (who lost both hands as a result of a horrific wartime accident) also proposes & marries his childhood sweetheart.",1481414400,,971,4.192513368983957

I liked the Soda Fountain at the Drugstore where one the main characters worked before the war. It wasn't long after the war ended, that the tools of war were recycled and used for peaceful purposes, as seen at the Airport. Hundreds of aircraft were being scrapped, and were shown lined up ready for the salvage crew. If you  like old nostalgia movies, this is it. It has a happy ending.",1469318400,,618,4.669724770642202

These veterans have to cope with a diverse array of issues including physical disability, psychological issues, marital issues and alcoholism.

I have been looking at recent reviews about this movie.  Many seem to suggest that the movie is slow moving.  It makes me think that my perceptions may be dated.  Time marches on.  I absolutely feel this is one of the finest movies ever made.  The cast is very powerful.  Frederick March and Myrna Loy are great Hollywood stars.  The musical score is great.  This movie was awarded nine academy awards.

I do not question modern tastes, It causes me to engage in introspection.  So I try to analyze the diverse perceptions.  The movie was made just after World War II.  Perhaps modern viewers may not relate to these stars.  Perhaps the movie is not exciting by modern standards.  I think there is little need for special effects in this movie.

I personally find the movie profoundly moving.  I suppose it is true drama rather than entertainment.  It is also an important work of movie history.  If an individual is interested in film making history I think this movie is a ""must see"".  Thank You...",1462665600,,1290,4.716216216216216

153751,5,0792846133,"William Wyler's The Best Years of Our Lives combines strong writing with excellent performances and dazzling, gorgeous cinematography from the great Gregg Toland. The film is not simply a brilliant technical exercise, though: it's a tremendously moving and involving work that always captivates, even with a running time near the three hour mark. There's a tremendous amount of compassion here for servicemen returning from World War II: the combination of a flawed job market and the emotional and psychological effects of warfare made re-entry into civilian life difficult for many soldiers, and the film handles this dynamic in ways that are powerful, honest, and sometimes heartbreaking.

My favorite performance has to be real-life World War II veteran Harold Russell, playing a Navy sailor named Homer Parrish who (like Russell himself) lost both of his hands during the war. Wyler never pities Russell or his character and instead treats both with a strong degree of empathy, admiration, and respect. This could have been overly patriotic and sentimental ( la Frank Capra), but its a very poignant performance, one of many things that makes The Best Years of Our Lives such a timeless classic and masterpiece.",1456963200,,1216,5.268041237113402

153778,5,0792846133,"This is probably one of the very best post-WWII movies ever made.

The greatest generation went to war, defeated Nazis and Nationalistic Japanese aggression. They fought in locals around the world, preserving democracy and freedom at home and abroad, but what was it like to come home?

The Best Years of Our Lives follows the post-war experience of three combat veterans...an officer, a US Air Corps bombardier who worked as a soda jerk before the war, a sergeant who was a well-to-do banker, and an enlisted navy man who was a local HS football star looking forward to returning home and marrying his HS sweetheart.

The officer married shortly before leaving for war, and came home to a wife who only wants a life of parties and night clubs, even though they can't afford it.  The sergeant returns to his bank with an entirely new vision of what it means to have collateral for a loan, and the navy man is disabled, having lost both hands to intensive burns, and has to overcome personal challenges before he can consider moving on with life.

This film provides a reverent vision of challenges faced by returning WWII vets.

Just thinking about this film makes me want to watch it again soon!

The problems of one day you're getting shot at by the enemy and the next day, you're home in, oh, I don't know, Indiana, and you're supposed to make the transition with no problems.  Yeah, sure; pull the other leg why don'tcha?!  Be sure to have plenty of Kleenex with you because only a dried up old sour apple could watch this without something in it touching your heart.

153867,5,0792846133,"This is a glorious film, still engrossing viewing although its subject matter - the difficult adjustment facing servicemen returning to civilian life after the Second World War - may seem a long way behind us now. In fact, the real subject matter of the film is timeless: that loving relationships are the key to a good life. The messages are put across beautifully by an inspired director, a strong script and a series of superb performances by the cast. Myrna Loy stands out, even in this brilliant company, while Teresa Wright and Virginia Mayo play beautifully in their roles. Dana Andrews acts better in this than in any other film I have seen him in and Frederic March impresses in a complex, layered role. Special mention must go to Harold Russell, an untrained actor in his first film, who carries off his role as a disabled veteran most effectively.

Some scenes are breathtakingly good: look at the one where the Frederic March character is in a bar, with two of the other characters playing a tune on the piano for him, while in the background the Andrews character is making a heartbreaking phone call. Such classic film-making means the nearly three hours of 'The Best Years ...' fly by.",1442966400,3,1200,4.741626794258373
153868,5,0792846133,"I cannot imagine anyone not finding this a five-star movie. Twenty or so years ago there were a great many Americans who had little, if any, exposure to war veterans.  Such persons might have found the issue of adjustment to civilian life after the trauma of soldiering rather removed from their own existences. Today, however, we have too many veterans whose lives are quite similar to those of this immortal movie's protagonists. Thus every American  can commiserate with these characters and  I am certain will feel, when the movie is ended, a glorious and profound uplifting, i.e, what we call today a feel-good movie. For its contagious optimism, this picture would be a bargain at ten times its price",1442016000,3,706,4.915966386554622
153889,5,0792846133,"In assessing post war film making, this sometimes overrated film holds up extrodinarily well.

From the opening scenes one realizes that this is a film not so much about peace, but about the pre post traumatic stress era, of go forward with you life, while gently suppressing the hard memories that many of us have had to do in light of current events.  The casting is superb, the acting unaffected and the storry line flows as smoothly as Hugo Friedhoffers score, which coincidentely won him an Oscar.
Not a lot of action in this film but plenty to ponder as I watch my parents generation adjust to the ""Best Years of Their Lives""

154036,5,0792846133,"I could not imagine this movie would turn out to be so good. I had read positive things about it, but these were all understatements. Frankly, this film was a different experience. It dealt with the trauma of WW2 veterans when they go back home. Two army members and a sailor who lost both hands in fire. All three must adjust to modern life in different ways. Homer, the sailor, must deal with his handicap, which he seems to handle well, except when confronted with the possibility of losing the girl he loves. As he believes that she looks at him with pity rather than love, he is at risk of losing her. The older veteran in the group returns to his family and his job only to find himself fighting a war at home: a war for veteran rights to get a decent loan so they can continue living, even if they are considered under bank policy a bad risk. One of my favorite parts in this film is when he has to make a speech to his colleagues being half drunk, and gets a standing ovation after defending veterans. The third soldier, a younger one must cope with a disloyal wife, a new low-paying job, and the possibility of not marrying a woman who really loves him. There is nothing sentimental in this film; no tear-jerking scene. It is sympathetic to its characters and deservedly so. Undoubtedly, the film makes a case for returning veterans, and does so in a compelling way. This definitely is a great film.",1424217600,3,1408,4.4192307692307695

I have always responded by saying that I have many, many favorites but I also say that if I had to pick just one movie then it would be "" The Best Years Of Our Lives"".I felt this way about the movie from the first time that I saw it. After Viet Nam and two tours of duty my feeling was even stronger. The people that fought that war and worked in the war factories truly are ""The Greatest Generation"". All of us come home from war wanting the same thing, to live quiet lives. Harold Russell, the man who lost both hands during world war two and was awarded the Academy Award for his role in the movie, died a few years ago. He lived a quiet life with his wife on Cape Cod. He auctioned off his Oscar when his wife need very expensive, life saving surgery. He was a fine example of ""The Greatest Generation",1420416000,,871,4.099415204678363

Beautifully acted with believable dialogue, we see adult people dealing with their changing lives. Even if you've seen it before, it still has some punch. Who can forget former bombardier Dana Andrews sitting in the nose of a junked B-17 seeking a job from a former tanker jealous of ""flyboys"" like him?  Or real war hero Harold Russell demonstrating his prosthetic hooks? Frederic March granting a GI loan to a sharecropper's son?  Or party girl Virginia Mayo divorcing Andrews to go with former GI Steve Cochran? So what if it's in black and white? We living in the millennium know the future of the America inhabited by these characters - decades of unprecedented growth and prosperity those veterans helped make happen. The ordinary Americans in BYOOL still have a few things to show us about what is best in our great country. Worth watching for every one of its 172 minutes.",1420329600,,1056,4.728260869565218

154131,5,0792846133,"This is a great movie and worth all the Academy Awards it received.  The return of soldiers after war, and just exactly what they return to, is a timeless theme, no doubt played out over centuries, and certainly millions of times in 1945.  In this movie, we have a soldier and airman and a sailer, not known to each other, returning home by the same taxi cab after a coming in to town on a military transport flight.  Each is dropped off at his home and assumes they will never meet again.  However, nothing goes smoothly for any of them, and they do end up meeting again several times at a downtown bar.  Eventually things play out OK, but not after many heartaches, and a lot of soul searching.

The acting is brilliant, which probably means that the direction and production was top-notch.  Dana Andrews and Frederic March were the stand-outs for this reviewer, but the cast is all good.  Photography, carried out with the artistic differences used for B&W, is great, and the quality of reproduction on the Blu-ray is worth spending more for it over the DVD.  The early airborne scenes of flying low over middle America, and the coming into everyone's medium-sized USA hometown is a feature.  One may ask how many men actually returned by plane, versus train, as the railroad network was huge and was, by far, the major player during WWII, but this film was made in 1946, so this is representing reality for some.

I did wish that some more extras could have been included, for example, something about Samuel Goldwyn as an independent producer, but let's not quibble over the perfection of this classic, which has been brought to us on Blu-ray so well.",1418688000,,1656,4.636986301369863

The story and screenplay is impeccably written, and the score is moving synchronously with the plot.  The actors are well-fitted to the roles they played and did justice to the parts they played.  In our times, there is no better and more poignant story that needs to be told again and again about the generations of the past, present and for the generations yet to come.  How often we forget those who faithfully serve our country with loyalty and selflessness; and also how quickly we forget those who they leave behind.
The Best Years of Our Lives is the life we enjoy in peace and in plenty, but let us never forget those who sacrifice to keep it that way.

154259,5,0792846133,One of the best movies ever made.  The interaction and friendships between the returning veterans is heart warming.  Being a veteran myself adds to my appreciation.  There are ups and downs in their adjustment to civilian life including a serious conflict about Dana Andrews romance with the Sergeant's daughter Teresa Wright.  The part of Harold Russell who plays himself is so real you forget it's a movie.  He actually lost both hands in an explosion aboard his ship.  The supporting cast is exceptional.  It was done in 1946 which was right at the end of WWII.  I'm sure this added to the depth of emotion the actors especially Russell felt in doing their parts.

Although the soldiers had fought in WWII, the subject is timeless because readjusting to life after combat is always a challenge.  The acting in this movie is superb and although each one of the three soldiers had different families and different story lines, the common thread of life after war was very well executed in the movie.  The only down side was that for some reason the my amazon prime connection kept kicking off so that eventually I turned off a movie that I had been looking forward to watching.

154265,5,0792846133,"Hollywood made many films about World War II between 1942 and 1945, including films about the Homefront.  But ""Best Years of Our Lives"" was the first film to deal with what it meant for military men to adjust to civilian life and how their loved ones dealt with it.

This is a movie about human beings and their relationships after one of the most trying times in modern history.  This is the generation that suffered a Depression followed by what was then the most horrific war to date.  ""Best Years"" was made just a year after this period of hardship and reflects the attitudes of three men and their families as well as various civilians whose opinions can never mirror the reality of the service men who had been in the thick of it.

We meet an older man played by Frederic March, returning to his grown children whom he remembers as younger and more innocent and his sympathetic wife, Myrna Loy, who supports him as he re-enters the world that's changed so much in his absence.  Teresa Wright is their daughter, a young woman who has grown up in a hurry but retained the moral values her parents taught her.

Dana Andrews is the second GI, who found glory as a bomber pilot but has no training for a substantial job and finds that the wife he married in haste before the war wants a glamorous and exciting life and has a cynical attitude about love and marriage.  Virginia Mayo plays this role perfectly, having been the ""bad"" good girl in several Danny Kaye movies.  She would reach the pinnacle of her ""slut"" performances three years later as James Cagney's bimbo wife in ""White Heat.""  Mayo had been a light actress but this role shows that she had a range of talent and could hold her own in a dramatic role against some very strong actors.

Lastly, we meet Homer, who has lost both hands during battle and has to learn to live in a world where there were less opportunities and medical advancements for people with disabilities.  The Goldwyn Studio made a brave decision to cast a real serviceman who had prosthetic hooks to replace his hands.  He had planned to marry his high school sweetheart but now has doubts about his ability to be what he sees is a burden to his fiancee.  Homer's grief is shown in his expression as he lies awake in bed while the other two men are celebrating.  Homer glances at photos of himself in high school, holding a football, something he will not be able to do again.  These shots express visually what movies can do without dialogue.

The movie is long but does not have any wasted footage or scenes.  It has humor, sadness, romance, and hope that these characters will enjoy the ""Best Years of Their Lives,"" which they've certainly earned.  The high definition streaming is excellent and spotlights the brilliant black-and-white photography.  ""Best Years of Our Lives"" is still a Hollywood version of post-war adjustment, but it's probably the closest thing to a documentary of this pivotal period in American life.",1414972800,,2961,4.625239005736137

We follow these men as they attempt to rebuild their lives in a world that has changed from the one they remembered.  It is a very real-life story and beautifully acted by Myrna Loy, Fredric March, Dana Andrews, Theresa Wright and Harold Russel.",1414368000,,628,4.417391304347826

154285,4,0792846133,"Best Years of Our Lives:

(Minor Spoilers)

I do enjoy the old movies, especially the Academy Award winners.  For 1946 or so, the entry The Best Years of Our Lives was an interesting drama.

Three guys all going back to the old hometown to see whats changed and to return to their families.

One guy was married to a blonde floozy and went off to war, quite decorated, and quite shy about talking about his war experiences.  His occasional flash-backs and the crush he has on a buddys daughter, make for some tension.  He was a bomber and highly decorated, yet cant make his marriage work and is relegated to the same job he quit:  a soda jerk!

Another is a Navy man, who lost both hands in a fire on a ship.  He has hooks and is pretty versatile with them.  Unfortunately in small town USA, people are not as forgiving and easily shocked.  His mom sobs that her son is so crippled.  His girlfriend actually doesnt mind, but hes too much feeling sorry for himself to notice.  This character was hard for me to like, wallowing in self-pity.  He did finally snap out of it, though. 

Finally we have an older guy who is returning to his wife and kids.  The wife is played well by Myrna Loy (of Thin Man fame) and her comedic style pops out once in awhile as she plays a straight part.  Her daughter falls in love with the airman with the blonde floozy and swears she will break up the marriage and take him for herself.  Who are you, God? intones her father.  A

Bottom Line:  Interesting story on how each man deals with family and how things have changed since they shipped out.  Acclimating to a new life is hard, and going into denial through alcohol or wallowing in self-pity just don't work.  One of a kind film.

Features:  Interviews with two actresses, elderly now, express a lot of what was going on with the set, the director and the actors.  Quite entertaining.

154559,5,0792846133,"Ever wonder what happens when servicemen come home after being in war? This movie takes a look. An infantryman, an airman and a sailor return home after serving during WWII, and after the jubilation of coming home to their loved ones, all isn't always happily ever after.
Frederic March plays Al Stephenson, an infantry sergeant. Al comes home to two grown and matured children and wife (played by Myrna Loy) who have learned to do without the head of the family. He gets a better job at the bank he worked at before the war, but sees other returning servicemen in much more meaningful terms than what his bosses at the bank do.
Dana Andrews is Fred Derry, an Army Air Corps captain who comes home to a wife (played by Virginia Mayo) who doesn't like their new 'social status'. Fred struggles with marital troubles and finding a job. He is also plagued by the invisible wounds of war in recurring nightmares no one could ever hope to understand.
Lastly, Harold Russell is Homer. Homer learned how to manipulate the prosthetic hooks that replaced the hands he lost as a sailor, but struggles with the feelings needed to reach out to those he loves. Homer and his family have difficulty trying to accept the changes that go well beyond the obvious physical ones he must deal with.
It's a great story, with additional players such as Theresa Wright, Cathy O'donnell, and jazz great Hoagy Charmichael adding value to this cinematic experience.
Will they all find the courage and strength needed to deal with the changes that war has forced upon them? William Wyler, winner of the Best Director Oscar for this 1946 classic, tells the story in his own inimitable style: with all the humor and drama that is sure to keep your rapt attention.
It's a snapshot in time to the last 'good war' of WWII, but the problems these soldiers faced are no different than those faced by today's warriors. It's a reminder to non-veterans, veterans and their families that, just because the war may be over, there are often many difficult and just as potentially devastating battles to fight when warriors return home.
A must have for Wyler fans, I guarantee you will enjoy this film.",1406937600,,2161,4.704485488126649

And Harold Russell's Homer is extremely poignant. As the story unfolds you get to know the characters and care for them. And you root them on.

Now this story at the time it was released was obviously more relative. But but ultimately it is about people trying to cope and move on, post war. I could not recommend this movie anymore highly.",1406073600,,601,4.513761467889908

154752,5,0792846133,"As a fan of classic black/white movies, this one rates right up there as one of the best!  The story follows 3 servicemen from the same hometown who are going home after World War II and how they adapt to their lives once they are out of uniform.  The movie is in black and white...yes, I know the cover of the CD is in color - but it is in black/white.  It's a long movie with lots of depth, character study, and interwoven stories.

Dana Andrews comes back to a wife who loves seeing him in a uniform and she just wants life to be a big party.  Frederic March comes back to his wife, Myrna Loy, and 2 children and adjusts to working at the bank again and understanding that his kids are grown adults.  Lastly, Harold Russell comes back with both hands missing and replaced with hooks.  He has to deal with the girlfriend he left behind and his parents who have a hard time coping with his handicap.

The script is very clever, honest, and beautifully written.  It's one of the more honest movies in showing just a portion of what the servicemen had to deal with fighting in the War and coming home to a ""new"" and different home that they left.

This movie won 7 Oscars in 1947 for Best Movie, Best Director, Best Actor (Frederic March), Best Actor in Supporting Role (Harold Russell), Best Screenplay, etc.

The acting is incredible because the story being told is incredible.  I always re-watch this moving around Memorial Day because even now, in 2014, it is so relevant and makes one appreciate the wonderful country we live in.",1404604800,,1533,4.435714285714286

But they were simpler times and simpler stories too. So here is a movie made by a guy who was really in the war ( Billy Wilder) and that is as real as it gets. A guy with no hands in a main role! But it has to be a story of hope too. I am sure Billy Wilder felt he owed that to the vets and the American public.

154777,5,0792846133,"This movie is truly timeless.  William Wyler is one of the all time great directors.  Kudos to Sam Goldwyn for making it.  He is quoted as saying he didn't care if the movie made a nickel, as long as every man, woman, and child in America saw it.  Even the sergeant/banker's son reflects the anti-war, liberal thinking in schools way back then, and the effect it was having on students.  The son, given a couple of war trophies comments on the value the Japanese put on family, then talks about the evils of the atomic bomb.  There are lots of movies from that era that are excellent, but even at that, I find myself wanting to edit some of the dialog.  Not this one.  Perfect.  Start to finish.  The cinematography is also pure art.  Again, congrats to Wyler for the direction and use of extreme depth of field to show two stories in one frame, yet with neither distracting from the other.

Only complaint.  The aspect ratio is off.  Looks like it was stretched to 16:9...not cropped top and bottom, but stretched.  No amount of tweaking of aspect ratio on my Roku boxes (two different models), computer, or two different brands of TV could correct it.

It's the story of three servicemen returning home after Word War II and learning how to assimilate back into civilian life. Each experiences his own hardships and trials and in the process we, as viewers, are asked to contemplate our cultural values and are reminded of the power of love and friendship.

Since this movie was made in 1946, it can be a little difficult to watch as a modern viewer in that it's black and white (I know a lot of people who don't like black and white movies), it's very slow in places, and it's a snapshot of a different America, which just feels a little unfamiliar.

Frederic March is brilliant, as usual, as the Army Sergeant, Al  Stevenson, returning to his wife (Myrna Loy, the archetypical good wife), family and well-paying job at the Bank, Dana Andrews is believable as Capt. Fred Derry, a B-17 Bombardier, returning to his family (played touchingly by Roman Bohnen and Gladys George), and his wife (Virginia Mayo) who...how can I say this?...exhibits a cavalier attitude toward marriage vows. Captain Derry is a regular working guy, who has no real career, and has trouble getting back into a job, which exacerbates the problems with his wife. The third serviceman is Homer Parrish, a Sailor who was stationed aboard an aircraft carrier, and suffered the loss of both hands, played by Harold Russell, who actually did lose both hands while serving in the US Army. For his work in The Best Years Of Our Lives, he received an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, one of only two non-professional actors to ever do so.

Everyone talks about How Green Was My Valley being the movie that beat out Citizen Kane for Best Picture and Director so I thought I'd write a similar about a similar topic. I bought The Best Years of Our Lives mainly because I was curious about what on earth could possibly have beaten out It's a Wonderful Life for Best Picture, Director (William Wyler) and especially Leading Actor. (James Stewart) That being said I was pleasantly surprised to see a good, solidly acted, fairly well-written and extremely well photographed (same photographer as Citizen Kane so that should tell you something) film. The subject matter of three veterans struggling to readjust themselves to everyday life at home may seem dull and tepid to a modern audience accustomed to bombs, explosions and CGI monsters every twenty minutes and I respect that opinion because everyone is different but I largely enjoyed just watching these characters do their thing for two and a half hours.

However there are a couple things that detracted me from giving it five stars.

1. Frederic March is okay as the middle aged soldier Al Stephenson but what annoys me is that he often goes into these permanent self-conscious frowns and stony stares. It works well in the serious scenes like when he's confronting Fred in the caf for flirting with his daughter Peggy but in other scenes like when he's celebrating his return or making a speech at a dinner party it looks a little strange. He isn't exactly bad but I'm pretty sure the touchy, subject matter of veterans coming home that almost everyone in 1946 America could relate to had more to do with his win than the quality of his acting. When I think about James Stewart's ""I know what I'm going to do tomorrow, the next day and the one after that."" and ""Please God let me live again."" speeches, March comes across as a little flat.

2. The way Al and Milly's son Rob just fades out of the movie. We only see him in two scenes and then he just sort of disappears. Why didn't they invite him to go partying it up from nightclub to caf to resturaunt when they were celebrating Al's return? They invited the daughter so why not the son? Was it due to some sort of favoritism or was he underage for alchohol consumption--the second is hardly probable considering he looks about eighteen to twenty. He doesn't really make much of an impression on the screen and we never even see him turn up for the wedding at the end. So why did the screenwriters even bother to put him in the script? You got me. I found this a problem of sloppy screenwriting but William Wyler has to shoulder on some of the blame for that.

But back to the pros. The cast (with the possible exception of Fredric March) is just flawless from top to bottom.  Harold Russell gives a very vivid, moving performance as Homer Parrish and never hits a false note which totally baffles me since he was a non-professional but acts like he's been acting all his life. His subtle facial expressions (when he smiles and frowns and cries) look very real. Probably the biggest emotional punch is where he takes his girlfriend Wilma upstairs and shows her his harness and hooks for hands and you suddenly realize that this isn't an actor who just covered his hands up for the film--William Wyler hired a real disabled soldier.

Dana Andrews (Fred) has some great moments like the dream sequence, punching out the customer that tries to antagonize Homer and sitting in the broken airplane reminiscing on the past. Myrna Loy and Teresa Wright give lovely, restrained turns as Milly and Peggy and Virginia Mayo is particularly good as the annoying, grating, superficial blond bimbo Marie.

 Plus the movie does a very good job teaching a lesson that marriage isn't just about the mushy-mushy feelings--it's about for better or for worse, for rich or for poor and walking the line even when you're tempted. Fred realizes he was a bad husband and begged Peggy's forgiveness but unfortunately his wife Marie was too shallow and self-absorbed to realize her faults.

Probably the best parts were:

1. The scenes with Homer and Wilma. Their romance was so sweet and beautifully handled and the wedding scene was terrific.

2. Peggy telling her parents they don't know what it's like to have a marriage on the rocks because they always get along. Milly looks up at Al with a grin and says ""Oh yeah. In all the thirty years we've been married we NEVER quarreled or fought or yelled at each other. Right? How many times have I said I hated you and how many times did you call me an ungrateful woman and said we we're both useless and washed up? And we had to kiss and make up over and over again.""

Gregg Toland's cinematography is REALLY good. The best parts are the spacious shots of the town and city and the beginning where the three soldiers are looking out of the round windows in the airplane. Hugo Friedhofer's music is rich, lush and dramatic especially the scene where Fred goes to the broken airplane junkyard and Homer and Wilma's second scene in his bedroom.

I still think It's a Wonderful Life should have won the major Oscars that year (Picture, Director and Leading Actor) but The Best Years of Our Lives is still good in its own way.

155012,5,0792846133,A classic.  Probably the best true life investigation of the lives of the people involved in the aftermath of WWII.  How the people who stayed at home interacted with the men who actually served in war was compelling and heartwarming and poignant.  The returning service men had a preconceived notion of what America would be like when they returned and it was quite different because the everyday life of the people in America throughout the war had not stood still.  The ending gave hope but it also tried to reveal the struggles that lay ahead.  Certainly one of the best films of all time.,1392854400,,593,4.663461538461538

The human condition remains the fodder for all stories about people that make it to the screen but most do not create the necessary multi-dimensionality of both the characters/actors and the settings. From the returning flight to Centerville in the nose bubble of a B-29 bomber, to the interview for a promotion at the bank, to the beaded sweat generated by war memories (today's PTSD), to the pained glances of unfulfilled love shared during the wedding scene; this movie delivers handsomely.

We no longer live in an era where a person's word is always their bond and I would offer that we are the worst for having lost that clarity in our lives. Viewing such a poignant story as it unfolds before us with such clarity and truthfulness as when the multiple amputee attempts to cope with sympathy from loved ones for his wounds, takes one well beyond simple feelings of empathy. When Homer's girl friend helps him off with his prosthetic arms before she tucks him in for the night, while professing her unqualified love cannot help but cause a catch in my throat when I think of my fellow returning warriors from all of the wars I have been in or witnessed.

A classic, real, movie that puts-to-shame all of the mock reality venues/movies/shows of our current age.

Harold lost both of his hands in a training mission in 1944 and caught the eye of the films producer after seeing a military film featuring Harold and his ability to use his ""hooks"".

Keeping in mind it's a film from 1946, it looks outstanding.  Film grain is present, showing Warner Brothers thankfully did not DNR the film into oblivion, yet there are no obvious flecks or spots in the picture, indicating a meticulous restoration took place.

The (thankfully!!!) mono DTS-HD audio track is excellent as well; Hugo Friedhofer's beautiful soundtrack has never sounded better.

I've never seen this film look better except when I've seen a pristine 35mm print shown at an excellent film venue.

The new Blu-ray also includes the introductory and ending interviews with Virginia Mayo and Teresa Wright shot for the Pioneer Special Edition Laserdisc release in 1995.

I only wish they would have included the Laserdisc's isolated score track, which is still the only source for the ORIGINAL score for the film as the original recording of the soundtrack as was used in the film was never released on an audio format (LP or CD) (any soundtrack recordings available are new recordings of the score being performed by other performers.)

155077,5,0792846133,"This film is one of my all time favorites - one memorable scene after another. The stories of the three returning veterans are seamlessly integrated into the film and the performances of the leads - Frederic March, Dana Andrews, and Harold Russell are top notch, as well as the stellar supporting cast led by Myrna Loy, Teresa Wright, and Virginia Mayo. Even the minor characters - Ray Collins and a pre-Bonanza Ray Teal give effective, albeit brief performances. And the casting of the great songwriter Hoagy Carmichael as the disabled vet Homer Parrish's uncle created an additional dimension to the film as well. The scene in which he plays his tune Up A Lazy River while giving Homer a fatherly but kind lecture on how to deal with the difficulties Homer is having with family relationships is magnificently understated.
One gets a true sense of what it must have been like in America immediately after the war, in this case a fictional Midwestern city I would guess to be the size of Omaha. The scenes in which the Frederic March and Harold Russell characters return home are among the best I have ever seen - unbridled happiness tempered with, in the case of Russell's return, sorrow at the loss of a loved one's hands. The return of the Dana Andrews character tees up his already unraveling marital relationship.
Additionally the anticipation and reality of finally coming home (the airplane and taxi rides) are effectively communicated to the viewer. The brief shots of people and things in the city itself from the cab give the viewer an excellent sense of what it must have looked like in America right after the war.
The film's climax, the marriage of the Harold Russell character, ties things up nicely.
This film has been praised for its treatment of alcoholism, divorce, and physical disabilities. Nearly 70 years later these topics are still relevant and, although handled effectively in other films, the treatment here remains credible.
Even in the best of films there is almost always room for some criticism, however mild. While not detracting from the film's greatness The Best Years of Our Lives is no exception:
- Frederic March seems too old for the character he is playing. March, I believe was in his forties when the film was made and looks ten years older. To think that his character was an active combat participant in the war, as is implied several times, is a bit of a stretch. To a lesser degree, Dana Andrews also seems a bit too old for a young and lovely Teresa Wright. However, I do understand why it was cast this way - the box office draw of March and Andrews was key to the financial success of this picture. Too, actors in film roles more appropriate for younger men has been repeated countless times.
- To my consternation even this great film has a continuity error. This is one of my pet peeves as I know there were and are production personnel specifically charged with ensuring that the dialog, costumes, scenery, etc., remain consistent. In this case the Virginia Mayo character expresses shock at seeing her husband (Dana Andrews) for the first time out of his Air Force uniform, however, later in the film Andrews alludes to the times before the war when he would prepare a meal for Mayo behind the counter at the local drug store where he was employed as a soda jerk. One would assume he was not in his military uniform in that capacity.
Ok, enough criticism - this film is a masterpiece - one that I highly recommend.",1382572800,2,3466,4.71169686985173

155080,5,0792846133,"It's so much more than a movie.  So many components, too many components, came together in so stunning a film it couldn't be luck, couldn't be just chance.  It's providential.  And resulting effort is sacred.

William Wyler, himself a veteran, knew he needed to make this movie.  He knew he'd pour his heart and soul into the project.  His vision carried over to everyone involved.  But how could he have envisioned such a perfect score, almost transparent in the viewing, yet so integral to the emotional crescendos?  How could he foresee the power of the lighting, the editing, the cutaways, the acting synergy of such greats as Fredric Marsh, Dana Andrews, Myrna Loy, and the sublime, magical Theresa Wright?  Wyler's brilliance brought the elements together, but there was something much more at work, that created the whole.

And seriously, what about Harold Russell?  How could Wyler ever, in his wildest dreams, ever envision Harold Russell?  Here's a guy who never thought about acting, a total unknown - who, through an act of providence, was thrust first into unmitigated hell; then, because Wyler saw something, was given two weeks of acting lessons and a lead part in the movie.  The result is indescribable.  Russell makes this movie.  Russell IS this movie.  He won TWO Oscars for the role and entered the annals of Hollywood lore.  His acting career all but died, but the film lives forever.

And because of Russell, The Best Years Of Our Lives transcends a mere movie.  It transcends time.  It would have been relevant after the Civil War, 80 years before it was made.  It was relevant after Vietnam.  It's relevant today, 70 years after it was made.  And, God forbid we find reason to send our kids to fight wars 70 years hence, it will still be relevant.

Because, ultimately, the power of the film is that it gives you, me -- all of us who weren't part of the Greatest Generation - a powerful glimpse at their sacrifice.  An intangible notion that all that we have, all that we are, is due to their sacrifice and their commitment.  That unless you were there, you can never understand what they endured, but you can appreciate all they did.  And that appreciation extends to every veteran, every kid who has made, or is making, or will ever make, that sacrifice.

And that is why The Best Years of our Lives is the perennial American movie.",1380844800,2,2359,4.715686274509804
155081,5,0792846133,This is the Billy Wilder classic of returning home of World War II Veterans and trying to adapt to the changes that occurred while they were overseas.  It received an Academy Award for best picture. Fine performances by an all cast.,1380844800,,232,4.658536585365853
155082,5,0792846133,"After reading a hundred or so reviews of this film, I really can't add anything more. I realize the junk and filthy sewage coming out of Hollywood today from incompetent filmmakers is on a totally different plane as this film. So, I wish to ask two simple questions. I have not seen one review mentioning this slight 'flaw' in the film. Here goes: Where is Al's son after the first 20 minutes of the film? Why was he even cast in the first place? The character adds absolutely nothing to the film. He is on screen, then....gone. If I could have a meeting with Wyler, I would ask him these two questions.

Now, an open challenge. I have been wanting to do this. I shall the next time I view the film. Perhaps you would like to try it. I don't recommend anyone who has not seen the film do this. But, if you have seen it, preferably many times, try this: watch all 3 hours of this brilliant film with the volume turned DOWN! That will be a true testament to how good this film is. Watch for facial expressions and body language. Watch Myrna Loy's fidgeting body language  when first reintroduced to her husband. Both of them, married for decades, don't even know each other. Watch how the great Hoagy Carmichael interacts with Harold Russell. Observe how Roman Bohnen reads the citation concerning his son (Bohnen was actually only seven years older than Dana Andrews). Notice how Walter Baldwin deals with his handicapped son while helping him get ready for bed. See how he is no longer feeling pity for Homer. He is getting used to the fact that Homer is still his son and with hands or no hands, Homer is still his son. All this can be seen, and felt, just by body language and facial expressions.

While not wanting to place this ""human"" story (and that's exactly what it is) into a category of 'war film', it wouldn't hurt to watch this film immediately following a screening of the greatest war film ever made and war's  effect on the human condition, 'All Quiet On the Western Front' (1930). Upon the release of 'All Quiet On the Western Front', Variety wrote a review of which could easily apply to 'The Best Years of Our Lives' (substituting with The United Nations, of course): ""The League of Nations could make no better investment than to buy up the master-print, reproduce it in every language, to be shown in all the nations until the word ""war"" is taken out of the dictionaries"".

They married two months after he returned home in December 1945.) It was a box-office blockbuster in 1946, easily eclipsing ""It's a Wonderful Life."" Frankly, the acting is not great in this movie, and some of the dialogue isn't, either. But director William Wyler managed to transcend those weaknesses and evoke deeply felt sentiments without seeming manipulative or cloying. You really can't help choking back tears and rooting for all of the characters to resettle and succeed. Most memorable is Harold Russell, who had lost both arms nearly up to his elbows in a non-combat accident. He plays Homer Parrish, a disabled veteran. Not a trained actor, Russell easily matches pros Frederic March, Dana Andrews and Myrna Loy with his screen presence. Virginia Mayo is wonderful as a lively and decidedly unsympathetic wife. She gives the movie a lot of its energy. Hugo Friedhofer wrote the deeply evocative music score.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phil-s-Favorite-500-Loves-of-a-Moviegoing-Lifetime-2014-edition/dp/B00HU8VK4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)</a>",1377475200,3,1847,5.695652173913044

This movie remind the experience I share with returning Vet from Viet Nam War.  I knew veterans who was crippled or loss limps to their bodies.  Their wives or girlfriends dumped or divorced them for someone us because most couldn't or didn't want to face a relationship with a handicap person. In the movie it shows most of the wives and girlfriends waiting for their husband or boyfriends to come back except Dana Andrew wive who was cheating on him with someone us. In most part this wasn't true for Viet Nam Vets.  Most of the Vets that I share time with their wives was cheating on them or their girlfriend was mailing Dear John letters to them.  Most of these Vets were having a hard time finding Jobs like in the movie. The added element that wasn't reveal in the movie was the drug problem and sickness from use of chemicals(agent orange)that Vets pickup in Viet Nam. This Movie is ageless because it repeat the same problems that Vets from WW 2, Korean War, Viet Nam War, Gulf War, Iraq War and any further war that Vets may experience.

155131,5,0792846133,"This is a classic movie. Let's examine why:

The Subject: World War II created the world that we live in, today. While I did not fight in War II, my father, my uncles, and many friends of mine did. As a result, I took the tie and effort to study it, and what it did to our world. I've got quite a War II library, and I reread some of the volumes, to keep mu understanding current, and relevant.

The Movie: I was also an English major; I have a degree in Comprehensive English. I understand plot, theme, and character development. I've also helped to make a movie (albeit, an independently-produced one), but that has given me first-hand insight into production values, and my wife's career was spend in the movie/TV industry; her insights help my understanding.

Perspective: This movie was written and produced by white people. Okay, that is, to an extent, racist. But, it is a viewpoint, a perspective that cannot be denied. The entirety of World War II, the entirety of War, were not about blacks and the black viewpoint. What we are talking about, here, is THIS MOVIE. If a person of color cannot separate himself from the issues, he should not comment as a RACIST.

This is a superb character study. The individuals are superbly drawn and developed, and the plots intertwine believably and flawlessly. The themes develop effortlessly.

The newer discs may be lacking in some respects. Let us confine our negatives to the production values of those discs, and separate those comments from the movie, itself, and the larger, social issues.

If you cannot, or are unwilling to do so, please refrain from commenting.",1373328000,,1618,4.740213523131673

One of my favorite moments is when Al asks the piano player to play ""Among my Suveniers"" and he and his wife dance to it.  So funny because Al had way too much to drink & It brought back wonderful memories of my mother, as she played that song and many others like it on her little organ many years ago.  These classic movies and others of this era cannot ever be out done in my estimation.  I bought this for my daughter but am having a hard time letting go of it.

Although they each have their own lives which we get to see first hand, they are still intertwined. Together these three men find it within themselves to make these the best years possible. Full of both highs and lows, this movie is extremely touching and leaves you with a smile.

155162,5,0792846133,"Best Years of Our Lives is an excellent movie. Three servismen are returning home from WWII and each of them has to readjust to civilian life. Homer (Harold Russell) lost his hands and he has to get used to the fact that he is going to be dependent on his wife and his relatives. But he has a great loving family and Wilma is a swell girl so apart from his own demons he has nothing to worry about. Homer is a nice character, he is a goodhearted and easygoing fellow loved by his family, always ready to see the bright side of things and when he permits himself to love Wilma he gets what he wished for when talking with Fred and Al on the plane home. Al (Fredric March) has a perfect wife, a perfect daughter and a perfect son, he has enough money to get what he wants, and a good job yet he does not seem happy. Al is a likable guy but weak and his drinking problem seems to be an old habit and not a result of his war experiences.  If it is sometimes difficult to identify with Al's character, we have no such trouble with Fred (Dana Andrews). Fred has to fight maybe his worst battle yet. Very soon he finds war honours mean nothing. On returning home he loses his priviledged status of an officer and a gentleman, he has to forget his dream of finding a good job and a nice place to live, he is insulted by his wife and humiliated by a man he thought was his friend, and in the end he loses everyhing - his job, his wife and his new love.

Dirt, scratches and other debris have been digitally removed and the film now looks and sounds (DTS-HD Master Audio 1.0) gorgeous.  The moment the opening credits roll, you know you're about to see the sharpest transfer of ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" ever released on home video.  Keep in mind, however, that there's still some graininess present - which is common with vintage movies given the Blu-ray treatment - and I do not consider this a defect.  While original negatives of old films never have the sharpness of movies shot today with high-resolution cameras, I'm not a fan of digital noise reduction - which removes details from each frame.  All special features from the January 2013 DVD re-issue are also on this Blu-ray, with subtitles available on everything except the theatrical trailer.  The 1995 interviews with Virginia Mayo and Teresa Wright were shot on video tape hence are NOT in high resolution - nor is the theatrical trailer, which is still ragged and has not been cleaned.  Still, in my view, the November 2013 Blu-ray is now the ""gold standard"" for this title.  Note also that this film is presented in its original 1:37:1 semi-square aspect ratio format.  Like ""Gone With the Wind,"" ""Casablanca"" and other Golden Age classics, ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" was NEVER shot with wide screen cameras.

** DVD UPDATE:  The January 2013 re-issue DVD offers NO improvement in picture or sound quality from previous DVD releases (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo).  Beyond cosmetic changes to the box - this edition brings back the 1995 interviews with Virginia Mayo and Teresa Wright that were on the 1997 HBO Video DVD release of this film - and improves the look of the English subtitles - which were all left off the MGM DVD release in 2000.  The January 2013 DVD release is a ""must"" ONLY if you want everything previously released - on one disc.  Remember, the 1997 HBO Video issue was a ""flipper"" - part 1 of the movie and special features were on side one, part 2 of the movie was on side two.  The 2000 MGM issue had NO English subtitles and NO special features other than an old trailer.  The January 2013 issue has the entire movie, subtitles and all the aforementioned special features on one side of the disc, with ""no flipping"" required.

===============================
ORIGINAL CONTENT REVIEW BELOW.
===============================

* Just before legendary director William Wyler died, equally legendary director Billy Wilder was interviewed about his feelings about Wyler's films, from ""Best Years of Our Lives"" to ""Roman Holiday"" to ""Ben Hur"" to ""Funny Girl.""

* Wilder, a tough man who hated schmaltz and sentiment, the director of such classics as ""Some Like it Hot,"" ""The Apartment,"" ""The Seven Year Itch"" and ""Sunset Boulevard,"" suddenly got emotional, expressing great affection for ""The Best Years of Our Lives,"" noting that it was one of the best films he had ever seen.

* He reacted the way I reacted. He said that it was the only film that he could remember where he and the entire audience were drenched in tears within the first 10 minutes. It was an unforgettable experience for him, and he recognized immediately that ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" was obviously a deeply personal work for Wyler, where every scene, every frame, every note of music and word of dialogue, rang true with authenticity and emotion. This was Wyler's territory. He knew the material. And many of the scenes that were shot mirrored his own experiences when he returned home from war.

* This is why, after so many viewings, I still can't get over the fact that no matter how many times I say to myself, ""I'm not going to be moved by this or that scene,"" I fail miserably. I just can't help it. To say that this is a great film is an understatement of the highest order. And yet I can only count on one hand the number of friends I know who have seen this film from start to finish. I think the running length has something to do with it. You never see it on commercial television at all and unless you're lucky enough to have cable, you'll miss it entirely. And it's not a film that people are banging down the doors to rent.

* The wonderful thing about ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" is that it still holds up beautifully, unlike a lot of films that seem awkward or stilted. Fredric March, as the patriarch of the family (in an Oscar winning role), is stupendous. His acting and delivery of lines seems effortless and spontaneous, not the product of a script recited from memory. And to have Myrna Loy as his partner and the wonderful Teresa Wright playing his daughter (the latter an Oscar winner a few years earlier in ""Mrs. Miniver""), how can you lose?

* Like all great films, time has no meaning. The story sweeps you along like a great wave -- a ride -- that you never want to end. The famous ""long hallway homecoming shot"" that appears in the first 10 minutes of the film -- I don't care that it's the scene that most people remember and is usually the ONLY scene that turns up in any highlight reel of greatest films ever made -- it gets me every time.

* And the ending, the last line from the movie, the one uttered by Dana Andrews -- despite the sentimental setting -- is so fabulously understated and cynical and yet filled with such hope, that you can't help but be -- what I describe as being -- ""happily devastated."" It's a wonderful ending that purposely leaves you guessing about what will become of the characters played by Teresa Wright and Dana Andrews, but you can't help but feel that their future looks bright in spite of their apparent state of destitution.

* I just wish more people would see this film. There's a treasure chest of great movies from the past that people overlook every day. This is one of them. I pity people who still buy or rent movies based on slick packaging alone.

* I would rather pay $10 to see this film on the big screen or less than $20 to own this film so I can see it on a little screen -- than pay about $4 to rent junk that has a good looking box -- and a few great critical reviews from people you've never heard of.

* Some films are good enough to rent, but only a few films are good enough to buy. ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" is a film to BUY.",1358208000,22,6391,4.547515257192677

155182,5,0792846133,"When it comes to films portraying the post-war veteran experience in America, this film sets the gold standard.  Following the lives of three very different veterans returning home after World War II, it looks at the complexity of veterans' family lives and relationships, their struggles to find work, coping with serious injury and disability, and more.  One is a family man with nearly grown children; another is a newlywed who married his bride right before going off to war; and the third is a young man who is engaged to his childhood sweetheart.  They each face different challenges and different family and relationship dynamics upon their return, and because of this, we get to see a range of post-war veteran experiences rather than just one single experience.  This enhances the quality of this film rather than detracting from it, and it really draws us in to all of their lives.

The storytelling in this film is wonderfully rich and complex, and it tells a story that remains relevant to this day, with struggles our own recent veterans are now facing in readjusting to civilian life, finding work, and reconnecting with their loved ones as changed men and women who are not the same as they were before they went to war.  It has the added bonus of actually using a disabled veteran actor, Harold Russell, to play the disabled veteran character, Homer Parrish, a double arm amputee who uses prosthetic hooks.  Using disabled actors to play disabled characters is unfortunately quite rare in films even today.  My one criticism is that Harold Russell, who was an unknown newcomer when he was cast in this role, does not share top billing with the other leads, despite being a lead character himself, and I understand that this is a result of Hollywood star power buying top billing, but it is important to note that Harold Russell won two Oscars for his role as Homer Parrish in this film and did a superb job portraying the depth and complexity of this character.

If you are interested in stories that really explore the issues faced by returning veterans, I've seen none better than this one; and if you liked the post-Vietnam War film ""Coming Home"", you will love this film.  It has romance, drama, and above all, realism.  It is a true and seemingly timeless classic and I highly recommend it.  You won't be disappointed.",1357862400,2,2339,4.805486284289277

Sadly, it appears that all this new release does is recycle some extras from the original DVD release -- the interviews with Virginia Mayo and Teresa Wright from when they were still with us. Not to say those aren't interesting to anyone who hasn't seen them. And no commentary or making-of doc ...

Five stars for the film itself, one star for lack of extras.

For people who expect the print to be ""pristine"": of course it is not; no, the studio has not truly restored in fine detail this masterpiece.  However, the quality is fine for viewing - as good as, if not hell of a lot better than, many transfers of other films from the 1940s.  I'm confident that when they release this on Blue Ray/DVD the film quality should satisfy the fastidious.

As for no widescreen: I believe the film was made in a 1.37:1 aspect ratio - very close to 1.33:1, so no big deal.

For those who truly appreciate this film, don't let the negative reviews steer you away. And for those who find fault with Goldwyn's production/presentation? Watch something you truly enjoy. Your opinions don't concern us. We who truly cherish this gem will revisit it often.

155211,5,0792846133,"Another notch on the belt of Best Picture Winners I've finally seen, `The Best Years of Our Lives' was one of those films I didn't expect to love.  It looked overly long (almost three hours), somewhat stuffy and messagy (you know those films, and yes, I made that word up) and dated, which can be the kiss of death for a film nearly seventy years old.  Still, I had to see it (how can a true cinephile not) and so I settled in this past weekend to indulge.

I was riveted.

There are few films that can sustain such a dramatic central theme for that long a period of time without ever feeling overwhelming, and `The Best Years of Our Lives' does so with complete ease.  It endears the audience from the opening frame and keeps us glued till the closing one.  I didn't expect this at all, but I was swallowed up and never wanted it to end.

Yes, I was sad to see that it was over.

The central storyline of William Wyler's Oscar winning 1946 classic revolves around three WWII vets who return home after years away and try to adjust to civilian life with difficulty.  Al Stephenson has been married for twenty years, has two practically grown children and a very well-paying job at the bank waiting for him, and yet rediscovering who his family is and butting heads with his boss over the way in which vets should be treated takes a toll on him.  Fred Derry doesn't have any of that.  He was only married for a mere twenty days before shipping off and so his wife Marie isn't exactly what he bargained for.  She wants the finer things, but after exhausting his money from the army he realizes that life isn't easy for a vet with no real skills.  Working at a department store just isn't cutting it.  And then you have Homer Parrish, a Navy man who lost both his hands in the war and is dealing with personal insecurities that weigh heavy on him, especially since he can't see how his fianc&eacute;e could still be interested in him.

`The Best Years of Our Lives' weaves these stories with such fluidity and really embraces each of them with such heart and soul, giving us a real reason to root for each of these men to succeed and find the peace they need to move on.  March, Andrews and Russell are astonishingly good in their roles.  I'm sad that Andrews received no awards attention (he could have at least been nominated alongside March) and I do think that a lot of Russell's win was attributed to the fact that he was a true war vet with no acting experience (and really had lost his hands) and thus served as a true inspiration (thus the reason he has TWO Oscars for this performance) but one can't really fault his win, even if Claude Raines should have won.  Even the women here are outstanding, with Myrna Loy and Virginia Mayo really making the most of their roles.

Beautifully acted, profoundly written and directed to perfection, `The Best Years of Our Lives' is raw, earnest and honest and captures a truth that many films could only dream of.  It is still profound and meaningful today, hitting with great power and presence and just completely worth every single second it takes to watch.",1348444800,4,3105,4.4522968197879855

155224,4,0792846133,"My favorite film.  It is probably one of the finest examples of storytelling of 1940s Hollywood.  Great screenplay by Robert Sherwood, based on a book written in blank verse, Glory For Me, by MacKinlay Kantor. imdb.com lists seven Academy awards; it deserved them all, though I feel Gregg Toland's photography should also have been noted.

Best Actor in a Leading Role: Fredric March
Best Actor in a Supporting Role: Harold Russell
Best Director: William Wyler
Best Film Editing: Daniel Mandell
Best Music: Hugo Friedhofer
Best Screenplay: Robert E. Sherwood
Best Motion Picture

Watching it again, I am fascinated by the facial reactions of the actors, something a screenwriter cannot easily direct from the page, and I find the actor's talent and director William Wyler's talent and observations are key to the depth of the scene.  This work shines brightly as a masterpiece of storytelling on film.

The scoring by Hugo Friedhofer won the Oscar and his music is perfect for the emotional themes drawn out. His themes tie the varied returning veteran's experiences together into a seamless narrative mixing pride, uncertainty, joy, darkness and redemption. His scoring for the Homecoming and the Citation scenes always brings me to tears.

And every scene is like a photo masterpiece, thoughtfully plotted by Gregg Toland.  I could swear he was inspired for his composition by Norman Rockwell; so rich in detail, yet never cluttering the shot to obscure the characters acting in it.  You immediately get a feel and identity for the experience the Stephenson, Derry and the Parrish families as they move from this major transition of wartime separation to peacetime reunion.

The American experience of WW2 has had many motion pictures associated with it.  It is notable to me the best representation of the universal experience of the Post-war era is this personal tale of three men and their families, permanently altered and living their lives, from that point of reunion to the re-creation of their new reality of America as they hope to embrace it.  This is the Ultimate Veteran's Day movie.  It is the reality and the hope.",1343433600,4,2130,5.0687679083094554
155225,5,0792846133,"It is a shame MGM's DVD edition of this classic was so indifferent to the quality of the film and the needs of its  audience.

One would think that with the minimum amount of care put into this disc that they would have at least priced it accordingly, but it is also rather expensive.

That bring us to the HBO edition, long out of print, but worth seeking out if you can find a copy, It offers subtitles in addition to superior image and sound quality, an isolated music track, cast bios, the trailer, poster, and brief interviews with Teresa Wright and Virginia Mayo.

The film deserves the full Criterion treatment, and we can only hope they will eventually turn their attention to this wise and extremely moving film. Until then, I advise avoiding the MGM disc and recommend the superior product from HBO . . . if you can find it.",1342224000,6,978,4.545454545454546
155226,5,0792846133,"In modern times we are very familiar with how hard it is for veterans to return from war. We understand about the post traumatic stress, the challenges they can have adjusting to civilian life, and so on. But in 1946, this sort of knowledge was far less well known. Returning vets were often told to ""get over it"" and just forget about what they'd seen. The Best Years of Our Lives is a powerful look into how three soldiers returning from WWII deal with their new lives. As it came out in 1946, right when this was happening, it was quite timely, and helped audiences realize just what was going on around them.

First we have the air force captain who is used to the high life. He had been elevated from soda jerk to idolized man and won awards along the way. He expects to come home to his brand-new beautiful wife and continue his upward progress. But instead he's back to being a soda jerk and his wife loses interest in his non-uniformed look.

Next is the solid, older family man with a wife and two kids. He finds it hard to cope with his banking job, potentially turning down loans for GIs who want to restart their lives.

And finally there's the navy man who lost both hands in a tragic accident. The actor who plays him was in fact a vet who lost both hands, which makes the scenes with him quite powerful and compelling. This isn't CGI at work. He really has dealt with what is being described.

What makes this movie even more involving for me is that they tell not just these men's stories but also the stories of those who love them. The girlfriend of the navy man adores him with all her heart. She doesn't mind the loss of his hands. She wants to be by his side. She feels frustrated and shut out when he repeatedly turns away from her.

So many classic movies have a nearly all male cast, and it might have been accepted here since the movie is about war's aftermaths. But the writers created a fantastic screenplay which won an Oscar; one which showed how so many others - mothers, wives, girlfriends, daughters - were intricately affected as well.

It's a shame that, while most people have seen Casablanca, Citizen Kane, and other classics, few have seen this one. Maybe it's the 3 hour running time. Maybe for some reason it doesn't seem as ""exciting"" as a movie about war times. But there's a lot of powerful discussion here, and the messages are just as powerful in modern times as they were then.

Highly recommended.",1339459200,4,2443,4.427616926503341
155227,4,0792846133,"This is quite a remarkable film. For one thing, the disabled veteran was played by a disabled veteran. In fact, the liner notes point out that he was the first one cast. The script originally had him as a shell-shocked sailor. But then the director and the producer saw a documentary film in which Harold Russell told his story about losing both his hands and learning how to use mechanical hooks instead, and they re-wrote it.

Three guys coming home from the war. While arranging transport, they discover that they came from the same home town, the fictional Boone City. So they ride home together, and agree to keep in touch.

Al Stephenson (Fredric March) had been an army officer in the war. Before the war he had been a banker, with a posh apartment in a luxury building, a lovely wife (Myrna Loy) and two nice kids. Problem is, the kids grew up while he was away, and he barely knows them. Especially his daughter Peggy (Teresa Wright), who has turned into a lovely and smart and very nice girl.

Fred Derry (Dana Andrews) was a bombardier in the Air Force, and was also an officer. But he came from a far more humble background. His father and step-mother live on the ""wrong side of the tracks"" in a place that looks like it wouldn't even keep the rain out. His wife Marie (Virginia Mayo) had been living with them for awhile, but moved out and got her own place, and also got a job in a nightclub.

Meanwhile, Homer is worried about how his girlfriend Wilma -- the girl next door he has loved since they were kids -- is going to take his handicapped condition. He's learned to use the hooks pretty darn well, even learns to play the piano with his uncle who runs a tavern, but he's aware of how everyone looks at his hooks, and looks away, and acts all self-conscious around him. He spills a glass of lemonade at Wilma's house the first time he went visiting her folks, and got so self-conscious he went off to His uncle's tavern. And who should show up but Al and Fred. Al has brought his wife and daughter out to ""paint the town,"" and he's stinking drunk. Fred hasn't even found his wife yet, because his father and step-mother don't know which nightclub she works in, so he's been making the rounds. So he's drunk, too. The Stephensons drive him to the apartment house where she supposedly lives, and he rings the bell, but there's no answer. He falls asleep on the doorstep while waiting for his wife to answer the door, so the Stephensons take him home with them. He sleeps in Peggy's room while she sleeps on the couch.

By the time Fred finds out his wife was far more interested in his money (the allotment check that arrived every month which was sufficient for her to indulge herself in her cheap way), and that she had ""made a lot of friends"" while he was away, he's already fallen in love with Al's daughter Peggy, and she with him.

How all this works out, I will leave the story to tell you. But I'll give away the ending: Fred and Peggy kissing at Homer and Wilma's wedding!",1337385600,2,2998,4.402527075812275

What a wonderful movie, and for grandchildren of WW2 vets like me, it was a very moving depiction of what coming home from the war must have been like, and getting readjusted to family life after being gone for years. I cried in certain parts thinking of my grandparents and how it must have been for them. And now 60 years later to see this as a time piece, noticing the streetfronts and cars, etc, and how women and men were restrained and refined even under difficult circumstances. I really enjoyed this movie, and how many of our grandparents were married at home, etc and to get to have a little peek into what it must have been like for them. And the people on the sets were real veterans and the man who lost his hands really did lose his hands in the war and was able to tell his story on screen and reach out to other vets offering hope. It was so worth spending an afternoon going back in time like that and will definitely watch this again and again. I didn't want it to end. Wonderful movie.",1296950400,4,1087,4.205741626794258

155251,5,0792846133,"I absolutely LOVE this film!  My father is a WWII veteran.  I think of him and his peers when I view this movie.  So many aspects of coming home from war are touched upon in this film.  When I see it, I wonder sometimes if we have really changed so much.

Here is why I say this...The soldier longs for home, for his family, for his girl.  And then when the day finally arrives that he is actually going home, the uncertainty sets in.  I know I've changed.  Will my family understand this?  What will they think of me?  Will I be able to relate to them?  Or the soldier who suffered the loss of his hands.  How will people treat me?  Will I be able to function as a man and provide for my family?  Or will people feel sorry for me/pity me?  The soldier who comes home only to find that his wife has moved on.  That she is selfish, only thinking of herself and the next good time.  The realization that the relationship was superficial from the beginning.  That just when he needs support the most, it is not there.

As well, the family who waits for the returning soldier.  They have been dreaming of this day for a long time.  But when he finally is home, he is somewhat like a stranger.  They know that he has been through experiences that they will never fully understand.  The wife's desire for things to ""get back to normal.""  The reality that things can and never will completely be the same.  The returning father who tries to relate to his children.  He remembers as they were when he left, but they have grown up now.  They can't fully relate to what their father has been through. Then there is the ""cluelessness"" of the folks in the community who wonder where the soldier has been all this time.  They have no understanding of what the soldier has been through or how they have changed...nor do they want to hear much about it.

The performances in this film are stellar and the musical soundtrack really captures the heart of the film.  One of the most telling scenes is when Dana Andrews (who played a former tail gunner) climbs into a junked bomber parked in a field.  As he looks out the dirty windshield with the sweat running down his face, he starts to imagine, once again, that he is in the heat of battle.  The music reaches a crescendo that transports us into the battle with the loud and unwavering hum of the bombers as they enter a dangerous confrontation with the enemy.  The fact that an actual veteran, played by Harold Russell, with a real disability is in the movie helps make it the classic that is truly is.  He was basically untrained as an actor, which contributes to the everyman appeal of this film.  You couldn't ask for a better cast in this film, Frederic March, Myrna Loy, Virginia Mayo, Teresa Wright, Cathy O'Donnell, Dana Andrews, and Harold Russell.

I hope that MGM, or whoever the distributor is, will come out with a fully restored version and a documentary that talks about the making of and legacy of this wonderful film.",1292716800,5,2969,4.413284132841328

155262,5,0792846133,"Deservedly hailed as one of the finest American movie classics, this wonderful film continues to improve with the passage of time, and with each repeated viewing.  Legendary director William Wyler assembled an extraordinary cast of players, all of whom deliver the performances of their careers.  Robert Sherwood's screenplay, based on MacKinlay Kantor's beautiful novel-in-prose, ""Glory for Me,"" is intelligently crafted and strikingly ahead of its time---especially by Hollywood's standards of the day.  Consider the fact that the topics of alcoholism, infidelity and divorce are key points in the multi-layered story.  Photography, editing and scoring are also on the highest degree of excellence.

This is a priceless time capsule from a very special era in our country's history.  We follow the return of three World War II veterans to their (ficticious) home town of ""Boone City,"" and the difficulties they encounter in re-adjusting to civilian life.  From the heroic opening fanfare of Hugo Friedhofer's superb music score, to the final frame of this cinematic masterpiece, there is never a false moment in the dramatic narrative.  Every scene is a pure gem!

155265,5,0792846133,"After World War II three military men, Al Stevenson (Fredrich March) Fred Derry (Dana Andrews) and Homer Parrish (Harold Russell), return to their lives in Boone City after stints in Europe. Adjusting to life at home isn't as easy as one would think as Homer has lost his hands, Fred goes from being a Captain to being relegated to being a soda jerk in a drug store, and Al goes back to his bank job where he has to turn down loans for fellow former soldiers. As they try to adjust to their new old lives they learn things may never be the same again.

William Wyler was already a famous filmmaker before going into the military for World War II, having made films such as Wuthering Heights, Jezebel, and Dodsworth. Incorporating his own experiences as a combat filmographer into the film, Wyler made what is arguable his most successful film with The Best Years of Our Lives. After it's release it went on to win 7 Academy Awards beating out It's a Wonderful Life for Best Picture, and Harold Russell won not just one but two Academy Awards (one for Best Supporting Actor, and an honorary award ""For bringing hope and courage to his fellow veterans through his appearance""), the only actor to ever win two Academy Awards for the same performance.

The Best Years of Our Lives is a film that has a lot of pertinence in today's world with so many troops overseas making their way back, and it's still the best film on the subject. Wyler's attention to detail, choosing not to make things over lavish as most films in the 1940's did, and to give it more of a documentary flair help give the film more of a real world feel. And while the subject matter might seem like the film would be a darker affair, there are moments that would still make you genuinely laugh out loud, as well as other lighter more tender moments.

The acting is superb from all involved. The two actors that truly stand out in my mind watching this are Harold Russell and Al Stevenson. Harold Russell, an actual physically disabled military man, shows great depth in his performance as Homer Parrish dealing with love and the notion that he needs to drive his girl away because she deserves better. Al Stevenson, also does a superb job as a former sergeant who feels guilty for having come home to find himself a good job while also dealing with family issues and his feelings toward having to away loans for former GI's who feel they deserve better.

I highly recommend this movie, this is one of those rare perfect movies and to be honest, it deserved it's best picture nod over It's A Wonderful Life. Even with it's ranking on AFI's top 100 films at #37, these days this film is still criminally overlooked and underrated. If you like films dealing with WWII, great dramas, and superb acting, you should definitely give this film a shot.

155269,5,0792846133,"This is a great movie that has held up really well over time.  At the time, it dealt very honestly and realistically with issues of war veterans returning home, and the adjustments their families and relatives have to make.  There is the war veteran who returns home with hooks for his hands, there is mention of PTSD, of the inevitable divorces, of difficulty finding work in the postwar economy.

But what makes this such a great movie is that it is a story of love and hope.

There are three love stories in this movie, all in different stages of evolution.

One is a long standing established marriage - the Myrna Loy and Fredric March characters are a  middle aged couple who thoroughly understand and still deeply love one another.  They fit together like spoons in a drawer.  Dare we use the word soulmates here?

In the characters of Harold Russell, the real-life injured veteran, and his girlfriend, played by Cathy O'Donnell, is the classic relationship of the girl-next-door, childhood sweetheart.  Russell, the only non-professional actor, is a bit stiff and awkward in his relationship with his girlfriend, and one senses a lack of chemistry here, despite the beautiful Cathy O'Donnell's best efforts at playing the dutiful and faithful girlfriend.  Russell did win two Oscars for this role, the only time that has happened in Oscar history.

The best love story is that of the characters of Dana Andrews and the lovely Theresa Wright.  First, though, the Dana Andrews character, coming from a humble background, loses his gold digger wife, who divorces him after he loses his job.  Wright's character is thoroughly well-bred, independant, and intelligent, having been raised in comfortable upper-middle class surroundings.  One senses that in today's world she would have almost certainly entered college and a career of some sort.

The movie ends on a wonderful shot - as they hug and kiss, Dana Andrews telling Theresa Wright: ""You'll know what it'll be, don't you, Peggy?  It may take us years to get anywhere.  We'll have no money, no decent place to live.  We'll have to work, get kicked around""

His words only bring out a glowing smile from Theresa Wright, as she understands this to mean that he loves her and they will be doing this struggle in life together henceforth...

The plot is well described elsewhere here, but there were several things in it I found very interesting pieces of social history. One is the information regarding some actual salaries of 1946. These included the wages of an Air Force bombadier, a bank VP and soda jerk. I was amazed at how high the first two were. Another notable thing is the general tone of worry about the future with high unemployment, economic worries  and a dread of the ""next war when we'll all be killed"". The opinion was also voiced that ""we just fought the wrong enemy"". This at a time when the US was the sole possessor of nuclear weapons and about to start the biggest economic boom in it history.

155279,5,0792846133,"Many viewers of this great American movie -- it won seven Oscars, including Best Picture, for 1946 -- are unaware that it was based on a most unusual book-length narrative poem by MacKinlay Kantor, ""Glory for Me,"" published in 1945.

In 1970, I was a lieutenant working at the Air Force Historical Research Center. The older historians told a word-of-mouth story how the book and the movie came to be. No doubt the story had been embroidered over many years of retelling, but here's the way I heard it.

In 1944, movie titan Samuel Goldwyn knew that whether the allied victory in World War II would come sooner, or later, millions of American veterans would return home. Many -- especially those with physical and psychological wounds -- would have trouble finding jobs and ""readjusting.""

Goldwyn knew that journalist and playwright MacKinlay Kantor, who had flown missions with the 305th Bomb Group from England earlier in the war, had gotten to know American servicemen in combat at first hand. Goldwyn asked Kantor to write a screenplay for a planned movie on the veterans returning home.

According to the story, Kantor had driven up to a Tennessee mountain retreat to work on the screenplay. He took his typewriter and a case of bourbon. He emerged some months later with empty bottles and ""Glory for Me,"" written in the form of a narrative poem, not a screenplay. Goldwyn was not pleased, and he eventually gave Kantor's poem to Robert Sherwood to reshape for the screen. When the film finally appeared, Kantor was given a minimum of credit. Sherwood -- deservedly -- won the Oscar for Best Writing.

If you like the movie, you will be richly rewarded by reading the poem.

Kantor's and Sherwood's treatments of the same characters and the same American town (""Boone City"") shows two gifted men working the same basic story in different literary forms, poem and screenplay. Reading the book allows one to discover how, here and there, they made some different creative choices.

In Kantor's poem, Homer's disability is spasticity, which makes for some painful reading. Sherwood gave Homer a physical disability -- loss of hands and the use of prosthetic hooks. Sherwood's choice was a wise one for the moviegoing public, and few are the hearts not moved by Harold Russell's ortrayal of Homer in the film. But Kantor's portrayal of Homer and his girl Wilma are equally moving, perhaps because the poem gave more room for character development.

When Frederic March played Al Stephenson -- the older sergeant returning to his prewar life as a banker at the Cornbelt Trust Company -- he masterfully compressed much of Kantor's material in eloquent but short scenes. In Kantor's fuller telling of the story, Al was the son of a pioneer banker who had made loans to farmers a generation earlier. The poem has more social and historical texture.

In Kantor's poem, Homer's uncle Butch (Hoagy Carmichael's character in the movie) provides a vehicle to explore class feelings in pre- and post-war America. This was one of Kantor's themes that Sherwood could not fit into the film. Similarly, Kantor told his readers more about Novak (the veteran asking for a loan to open a nursery) and his experiences as a Seabee in the Pacific. Kantor's use of lilacs as a metaphor for peace and normality could not be picked up in the film.

On the other hand, Sherwood changed the story line to say more about wartime marriages. Marie (Virginia Mayo in the film) proves shallow and unfaithful when Fred Derry (Dana Andrews) returns home. The movie's title, not found in Kantor's poem, came from a scene when the two argued.

The book was published in January, 1945, months before the war ended. Kantor well anticipated the major contours of veteran adjustment, but there was more to his foresight. On the final page of the poem he showed real prescience when he alluded to the unresolved social tensions that all Americans, not just the veterans, would confront in the coming years.

Reading habits have changed in the six decades since the book was published, and readers may now find that it takes some pages to adjust to the poetic form. Kantor's poetic shortcomings earned some dismissive reviews. Poems similar in form by Kantor's contemporaries like Stephen Vincent Benet are now dismissed as middlebrow when they are read at all. I am confident, though, that with each page the reader will find new lines and new scenes to savor and treasure.

""The Best Years of Our Lives"" is a truly great American movie. ""Glory for Me"" deserves equal recognition. Kantor recognized the coming drama of the returning veterans. He dignified their individual struggles in a literary form that recalled the great epics and placed the American veterans among mankind's heroes. He gave an immortal film -- a film that affected tens of millions -- its basic structure, plot, characters, tone, and feeling.

Not a bad result for a few months of solitude with a case of bourbon.

This movie is an atypically (for its time) hard look at the difficulties returning veterans had as they tried to get back to the business of living normal lives.

155283,4,0792846133,"This deeply moving, beautifully written and performed film, was a long-planned tribute by director William Wyler to veterans of World War II, whose heroic service Wyler witnessed first-hand.  Posted overseas himself during the war, Wyler vowed that when he returned to Hollywood, he would make a film that paid some sort of tribute to the men he worked with.  ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" is the fulfillment of Wyler's promise.  Released in 1947, the film won seven Oscars (it was nominated for eight) including Best Picture and Best Director.

""The Best Years of Our Lives"" tells the stories of three veterans returning home to their small midwestern city from active service in WWII: Fred, a much-decorated Air Force pilot (Dana Andrews) from a poor background who, before the war, worked as a soda jerk at a drugstore lunch counter; Homer, a Navy sailor (Harold Russell) and former high school football star who has lost both arms; and Al, an army sergeant who, in civilian life, is a successful banker with two teenaged children.

As the veterans return to homes and wives and/or family (only Homer is not married, although waiting anxiously for him is his high school sweetheart, Wilma, played by Cathy O'Donnell), they confront difficulties reintegrating themselves into ordinary life, and re-establishing emotional contact with those who have been waiting at home.  The men carry horrifying war memories that have changed their values and outlook on life, yet also experience disorientation going back to an existence that lacks the immediacy of life lived at the edge of survival.

Al Stevenson finds himself initially shy and reluctant to resume intimate relations with his strong-willed wife (Myrna Loy) - he has to realign the parameters of their relationship with her and their two children who in his absence have blossomed into adulthood.  Fred Derry, the Purple Heart pilot, finds that Marie, his lively blonde bombshell of a wife (Virginia Mayo), whom he married without knowing her well just before being sent overseas, has left his parents' home and gotten an apartment and a job of her own; Homer, the disabled sailor, cannot cope with his family's well-meaning but pitying response to his disfigurement, nor can he believe or trust that Wilma still loves him.

The film traces each man's response to the placid pace of civilian life, and to the readjustment he must make to the societal and economic changes of the post-War era that are already spreading across the country.  As a disabled veteran, Homer does not have to worry about re-entering the work force, but he feels like a freak and resists Wilma's attempts to reassure him that the loss of his arms has not changed her feelings toward him - he withdraws from his family into a painful depression.  Fred is plagued by nightmares about being shot down in his plane, and finds that while his old job behind a five-and-dime lunch counter is now inadequate for a man with his experience, his lack of higher education or other training leaves him few options. Moreover, Fred finds that his pretty wife is unsympathetic to his issues and self-involved, interested only in having a good time. Al finds that although he is welcomed back into his fine job at the bank, his desire to approve loans to returning veterans who haven't much collateral to back them up are challenged by his higher-ups, to whom he must explain why he trusts these men to honor their debt, and to whom the country owes a debt.

As Homer tries to drive Wilma away, because he does not want her to marry him out of pity, Fred's and Al's lives overlap.  Fred finds himself unable to function at his old job or take orders from a fresh-faced college grad who did not serve in the war, and loses the job when he slugs a man at the lunch counter who insinuates that the war was an unnecessary one foisted on America by Roosevelt.  Marie is unwilling to adjust her lifestyle downward to accommodate only his service benefits and resents not being able to go out and enjoy life, and eventually she leaves him for another ex-serviceman who is doing better.  At the same time, through his friendship with Al, Fred has met Peggy, Al's daughter (Teresa Wright), who is charming, intelligent, and virtuous, and falls in love with her.  Touched by Fred's struggles, and by the innate qualities that she discerns in him, Peggy is equally attracted to this diamond in the rough.  But Al, much as he admires and likes Fred, cannot approve of his cherished daughter's relationship with the drifting, still-married Fred, and tells Fred to stay away from Peggy.

Finally, in one of the most tender scenes ever filmed, Wilma one evening helps Homer remove his prosthetic arms and get ready for bed in his parent's home. Homer realizes that Wilma truly loves him and tells her that he has always loved her and will never love anyone else.  In another wonderful scene, the disrupted relationship between Al and his wife moves into calmer waters as they relate to the confused Peggy the emotional hardhips of the early years of their marriage, and how they moved forward, anyway, committed to their lives together as a family.  And, in what is perhaps the film's most famous scene, Fred exorcises some of his wartime demons in the cockpit of a B-52 that is about to be dismantled, needed for materials to fulfill the demand for inexpensive housing in post-War America.  Fred persuades the boss of the outfit performing the work to give him a job.

At the end of the film, the three veterans gather for Homer's wedding in Wilma's parent's house.  Marie is divorcing Fred, who is living with his father and stepmother.  During the touchingly home-made parlor wedding  (compare it to the luxurious church wedding of the spoilt Kay Banks in ""Father of the Bride"" just three years later), Fred and Peggy, at opposite ends of the parlor, gaze at each other during the simple service and silently commit themselves to each other.  While the other guests are congratulating the newly married Homer and Wilma, Fred takes Peggy in his arms and as he does so, her hat falls off as she embraces him, a charming symbolic reference to surrender and the move from girlhood to womanhood.

""The Best Years of Our Lives"" is a long film, nearly three hours, but is worth every moment of your time as Wyler, whose love for his protagonists shows in every frame, portrays their shifting relationships and the adjustment both they and America make as they move into the new environment of post-World War II America.

The performances are sensitive and heart-felt, with special mention going to Dana Andrews as Fred Derry, the tormented air force hero from the wrong side of the tracks who finds himself adrift in a new world.  Harold Russell, who plays Homer, was, in fact, a disabled veteran who had never acted when he was selected for this role.  While clearly the work of an amateur, his (wisely) unadorned performance works well and garnered a Best Supporting Actor Oscar.  Frederic March has never been one of my favorite actors, but his undeniable gifts bring Al Stevenson to life, and won for March the Best Actor Oscar.  Cathy O'Donnell (who would later appear as Charlton Heston's young sister in ""Ben-Hur"") gives an affecting, low-key performance as the patient, loving Wilma. Myrna Loy and Teresa Wright are perfect as, respectively, the classy, forthright Mrs. Stevenson, and as Peggy Stevenson, who shows her mother's backbone in her determination to stand by and help the man she has chosen.

Virginia Mayo, a highly under-rated actress, is marvellous as the high-spirited, ""selfish"" Marie.  Mayo has a thankless role here as the one woman in the film who is unwilling to sacrifice her own interests to support her man, but she makes the most of it and gives the role bite and life.  The role of Marie brings me to the one quibble I have with this otherwise flawlessly conceived and delivered film, of which I am deeply fond, and which never fails to reduce me to tears.

Wyler draws what is, in my opinion, far too sharp a distinction between the ""good"" and ""bad"" women in this film.  It is notable that Marie, the one woman in the film who is overtly uninterested in making sacrifices for the returning soldier, is also the only woman in the film who is overtly sexual. Marie's curvaceous figure, blondeness, provocative clothes, and love of a good time stand in contrast to the rather extreme asexuality of Peggy and Wilma, the two young virgins, who are both very thin, dress plainly, and are constantly seen happily performing routine household tasks such as cooking breakfast and washing dishes.  They appear to have no individual cores whatsoever that do not revolve around Homer and Fred.  The climate of the post-War era must be taken into account here, as a time when women were being heavily pressured to give up the jobs they had held during the war in the men's absence (and consequently, give up their taste of economic independence) so that returning veterans could have the jobs; women were also being heavily pressured to take up lives centered wholly on homemaking - the result, of course, was the post-War ""baby boom"".

Fred Derry is a sympathetic character with legitimate issues, but it is not as if Marie is entirely wrong to be disappointed at how things seem to be turning out when he returns. Fred IS a difficult package, and he and Marie married without knowing each other at all.  Marie loves her independent life and that she should be demonized (that is the only word for it) for preferring to move on and enjoy life, rather than staying home with a brooding, troubled husband who refuses to let her augment their slender income with a job, begs some questions of the ideals women were expected to fulfill in the post-War era - ideals which led to the first wave of feminism as the 1950s closed and the 1960s opened. As Marie storms out of their small apartment, she shouts, ""I'm going to live for myself!"".  No sentiment could have been less appreciated in American women after the war, and Marie's declaration is meant to demonstrate the height of unwomanly behavior, particularly compared to the purity, selflessness, and curious asexuality of Peggy and Wilma, as they commit themselves to men with notable problems.  Only Myrna Loy, among the ""good"" women, is allowed to show a bit of pepper and curve, but then, she has been proven as the faithful matron and mother.  In this reviewer's opinion, the contrast Wyler draws between the openly sexual and independent Marie and the two selfless, asexual younger girls, is unfair and, as history proved over subsequent decades of social upheaval, unrealistic.

That issue aside, my respect and affection for this exceptional film has remained undimmed over the years.",1208304000,5,10761,4.830794341675735
155284,3,0792846133,"This movie is almost 3 hours long but as a testament to how good it is you don't really feel it.  From the beginning you can tell you are watching a classic; from the great score to the excellent script and cast it's hard not to be caught up in the story and to be touched by it as well.  Despite its age, the film ages well because it covers themes that are still relevant today such as loyalty, adapting to new environments, self-sacrifice and lack thereof etc.  This movie stands the test of time and despite repeated viewings will still amuse, entertain and touch most of us to the core.

Unfortunately, this DVD version of this great film is an unworthy version to pay any respect to this classic.  It hasn't been restored well and so many picture quality imperfections exist and the sound quality is just Dolby Digital Mono which should be improved.  There are no Special Features to speak of as well making you wonder if you are better off getting the VHS.  Here's hoping that they will consider another restoration project for this film to vastly improve the picture quality and the sound quality by adding Dolby Digital 5.1 or THX Surround options plus some Bonus Features worth shouting about.

In the meantime, while this film is a true classic, you may want to wait for an improved DVD to surface so as to get the most enjoyment that you can from your viewing experience.  Perhaps a Blu-ray version may be just the excuse to restore this film to the quality that it surely deserves.  As for me I'll be keeping a lookout for a well-restored version and perhaps you should too.",1207612800,9,1587,4.5174825174825175
155285,5,0792846133,"Although this movie was made in 1946, it is still fresh, real, and deeply moving today.  The story involves the adjustments military men have to make when they come home.  (This was before we knew about post-traumatic stress disorder.) Surely the men and now, women, who are returning from Iraq and Afghanistan will each have their own stories.

William Wyler must have been a terrific director for actors because he got such spontaneous, naturalistic moments from this cast.  I found this quality of acting unusual in a film of that time.  The cast is terrific--each one gives a deeply moving performance.  Myrna Loy is so charming and at once sophisticated and sweet, tender and tough.  She makes you think about what the wives who were left at home to raise their children alone had to cope with.  Harold Russell's performance, as others have said here, is worth the price of the DVD.  I knew nothing of him, if he was a real amputee, a professional actor, or what, until I read the reviews.  He has an amazingly open, beautiful face and the sunniest smile you'll ever want to see.  The marriage scene which shows each detail of the hands, clasping each other, giving the ring, brought tears to my eyes!

Dana Andrews is great as the young, carefree, ex-soda jerk who married a blonde bombshell but comes to realize he may have made a mistake.  Frederick March is wonderful, too, as the ex-banker who returns to face a wonderful family, but there are still problems.  We see that he drinks too much and this is probably the only problem that isn't spelled out and resolved.  Teresa Wright is luminous as his grown daughter who falls in love with Dana Andrews.  I have found her acting a bit sappy in other films but here it rings true.  Virgina Mayo is gorgous and certainly convincing as the girl who just wants to have fun.

I really enjoyed the appearance of Hoagy Carmichael, a very cool guy, who gives additional class to this film.

It plays for three hours and I was glued to the screen for the entire time.  As a snapshot of a moment in America's history and as a universal human picture, it has great value.",1204761600,7,2119,4.585106382978723

155287,4,0792846133,"The world changed as a result of WWII, and it directly affected many people's lives. The soldiers that returned home faced a similar situation as the veterans from WWI. They found their jobs had been taken, their outlook on life had changed, and sometimes their families had been dismantled. The Best Years of Our Lives addresses the return home from war and the affects combat had on their daily lives. We follow Al Stephenson (Frederick March) home to his wife (Myrna Loy) and daughter (Teresa Wright). Fred Derry (Dana Andrews) returns to his new wife (Virginia Mayo). Homer Parrish (Harold Russell) comes home without hands and startles his family and fiancee Wilma (Cathy O'Donnell).

This film is a long and indepth look at the readjustment from a soldier's life to a civilian's life. We see the men returning to work, the disappointments that they face, and the changes they make. The movie has romance, heartache, and comedy which makes it appealing to a variety of audiences. This is one of those movies that was obviously made to contend for the Oscars; it won Samuel Goldwyn his first for best picture. It features a talented cast and well-written characters, and the direction is supurb. One will recognize many scenes from various film compilations and homages.",1203379200,,1274,4.953271028037383

155289,4,0792846133,"""The Best Years of Our Lives"" is a very calculated comment on post-WWII USA. The film follows the lives of three serviceman - one from the army, one from the air force, and yes another from the navy. The film explores just about every facet of the returning veteran: How tables can be turned from what you did during the war to what you return to in civilian life - Dana Andrews plays a highly ranked and decorated officer who lands with a thud on his return while Frederic March plays a lowly sergeant who comes bank to his job as a wealthy banker. Also on the same theme - how people who were below you when you left for the war are now your boss, how the people who were left behind don't understand you, and how the terrible memories of the war still haunt you. Even the isolationist policies of some Americans are criticised in the form of an agitator who gets his ""just desserts"". Disabled veterans are represented by the navy man who struggled to feel whole again.

The cast is excellent - save for the gooey-eyed overacting of Cathy O'Donnell. The music is overly sweet and intrusive but overall ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" captures the cynical post-WWII mood nicely and still resonates many years later.",1201132800,2,1214,4.493212669683258
155290,5,0792846133,"To start out, just so there is no confusion, this is a GREAT film.  It is one of my favorites.

But I'm not writing this review to gush about the film itself.  Many people have already done that here and quite a few have done a better job than I can do.  I am writing this to (hopefully) clear up some confusion about which DVD version to buy.

There were a few negative comments about the film itself, but those people are probably the kind of morons who think an interesting film has to have car chases and lots of explosions.  I guess we should feel sorry for them and their pathetic lives.

Virtually all of the other negative comments were praising the film but grousing about the quality of the DVD transfer.  The contrast was low (muddy grays instead of blacks and whites) and excessive noise on the video and audio.  But, strangely enough, others were saying that their DVD was fine.  All of the reviews about this movie were lumped together, but none of these reviewers mentioned exactly which version they were writing about.

A number of people (including myself) wanted to purchase this film, but we did not know which one to order.  It turns out that my local library had a copy on hand, so I checked it out this morning.  We didn't have time to watch the entire film, but we did jump to various chapters to see how it looked.

Apparently, we found the good version.  The blacks were black, the whites were white, and there were many shades of gray in between.  There was a little noise at the beginning during the opening credits, but otherwise the transfer was surprising clean for a movie that's over 60-years old.

And now (drum roll please) the copy to buy is:

The Best Years of Our Lives (1946)

* DVD Release Date: July 18, 2000

No nothing, but a quick 'thanks' as he takes off to work after all the humiliation after humilation he had gone through yet, with unspoken citations for heroism during the war left with his father.

155292,5,0792846133,"One of the best of the post-war American classics, perhaps the best until Coppola's ""The Godfather."" The film is as serious as they get, but there is a lot of ""The Thin Man"" kind of 1930's humor in the bedroom scenes, particularly between the married couple, played by Myrna Loy and Fredrick March. The humor does a lot to balance what is the somber theme of the returning soldiers whose lives will never be the same. The cast is superb, of course, topping the list is Myrna Loy, whom I adore, and Dana Andrews, a leading man type whom, with the coming of James Dean and company, history left behind. The film, however, had enormous influence on the shaping of the post-war hero who never again is all good and all pure. From then on, as with these three heroes, the good guys are only good part of the time. Think of ""Shane,"" for example, and all the post-war Western heroes: they too are twitchy, nervous, with something in their pasts that's eating at them. Dana Andrews can't sleep; this vulnerability is key to the shaping of the new hero type. He is damaged goods, and that's what makes him attractive to the ladies. Actually, that's what makes all post-war men attractive, that is, their suffering, not their heroics. The film lays the groundwork for all this, exposing the underbelly of the hero-myth.

William Wyler's epic deals with the assimilation of 3 main characters into the new America at the end of World War II.  They left for war when the US economy was down, see death and destruction in Africa, Europe and the Pacific and come home to a different economy, mindset and world.

I was born about 20 years after the end of the Second World War, yet this movie encompasses our current society as well as it did two generations before me.

Despite it being made in 1946, the film still holds it power today.  I remember being absolutely stunned by it, enthralled by all of its 3 hours.  It also shows that not every American was in love with the idea of fighting in WWII, and that many men were permanently disabled, both physically and mentally, by the war.  It also has a rather frank (especially for this country) and honest depiction of adultery (one of the main characters is married to a gold diggin' b****, and another woman desperately wants the man to break up with her so she can enjoy him).  It also has one of the greatest wedding scenes in movie history, taking up nearly 30 minutes at the end of the film.  It is filmed exactly as it would happen in real life, and Hoagy Carmichael (yes, that Hoagy) is playing the piano during the ceremony.  The scene is incredibly moving, and there isn't one ounce of forced sentimentality.  It's incredibly honest and deeply moving.

The girls in my class were amazed.  Then I shared with them some of the other things Russell had accomplished in his life - like being a founder of AMVETS.  Russell's off screen story is a story in itself and should be made into a movie.  Unfortunately, no actor could convincingly play him.

155304,5,0792846133,"This is my favorite film of all time, a 3-hour movie I can sit through again and again and find new details and joys I never noticed before. Everybody involved in it, from the director on down, so clearly believed in it that it deserves to be considered not merely a classic but a required film experience for anyone with even one working eye.

""The Best Years of Our Lives"" began life as a book-length 1945 poem by MacKinlay Kantor called ""Glory For Me,"" longsince out of print, which I found in Larry McMurtry's fantastical Archer City, Texas bookstore several years ago. The book-poem, sadly, is AWFUL. Pretentious and slow-moving, a good idea gone very bad. The character names are the same, but few other details correspond to the movie, it appears the filmmakers just took the barest interest in Kantor's poem, which is all to the good: Homer, for instance, is not a double amputee in the poem; he has suffered some kind of brain damage and has constant ""spastic"" episodes that render him helpless. I don't know if they changed Homer's disability and then went to find an actor that corresponded, or changed the disablity in order to cast Harold Russell (this might be information gleaned from a DVD extra, if there were any), but regardless the perfect actor found the part and he delivers a performance that is at once tragic and heroic, and he deserved the 2 Oscars he received, as Supporting Actor and as ""an inspiration to wounded veterans everywhere,"" which he certainly was.

As is almost always the case with great movies, many other happy accidents happened along the way, such as the casting of Dana Andrews as Fred Derry. As written, Derry is about 24, considerably younger than Andrews was, but he is SO GOOD in this part that you never notice, or care. Many actors give career-best performances here, certainly the devilishly gorgeous Virginia Mayo, almost always a ""nice"" girl in her other roles, but here she chews the scenery in the small apartment she shares with Andrews and you find yourself wishing she'd been a bigger star. Frederic March and Myrna Loy gave so many excellent performances in their long careers that it's hard to single out any one part, but there's no denying the realism and power they bring to this portrait of a middle-aged married couple finding each other again after a distance of years and thousands of miles through the long ""great"" war. March's slide into alcoholism toward the end of the film signals another hallmark of the survivors of the 1940's, and for a kind of unofficial sequel to this film I highly recommend ""The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit,"" both the movie and the book by Sloan Wilson, to see what happened further down the road.

At any rate this is a great film, and the long scenes detailing the three veterans' first day home from the war is so good it could almost be a movie all by itself. Coming home at last, something they dreamed about for months and years while they were off fighting, high expectations gone almost instantly awry, colliding with the reality of returning to a world that moved on without them while they were away. The movie is about how each of these three men (and, in a phrase oft used at the time, the women who love them) come to grips with the new lives they have to live after the cataclysm they've survived, how they triumph or fall victim like their lost comrades on the battlefield. The world we live in today is in large part a product of men like these, and it's good that we have a movie like this to honor them and their sacrifices. They aren't ""the greatest generation"" simply because they fought in the war, but also because they continued to fight when they got home to give their children more than they had, to be safe from Depression and world war and the rest of what they had to face. Their need for safety and security led directly to their children becoming rebels and hippies twenty years later, but that's another story. This movie is about them, and it's a movie as fascinating and interesting as they themselves are. ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" isn't a historical artifact like an old shoebox full of rusty medals and yellowed love letters, it's a living, breathing, fully entertaining monument to a time and a generation that are as important to us today as they ever were.

Captain Fred Derry is trying to get a flight back home to Boone City. He meets two others from his home town, one who lost his hands. All that Derry wants is a good job for his future. They see hundreds of airplanes that will be junked for scrap. The ride down Main Street shows hundreds of small businesses. [Most would be gone in another generation.] Homes have big porches. Elevators have operators. The film shows the homecoming for each veteran, and the reaction of each to their new situation. There is an interesting comparison of military rank to neighborhood. Would that ever occur again?

After a night out their adjustment to civilian life continues. No one finds any tragedies at home. Fred's old owner-operated pharmacy is now part of a chain. Al is offered a promotion to Vice President in charge of Small Loans at the Cornbelt Bank. Homer can practice firing his .22 in his backyard [what freedom they had!]; Wilma still loves him. Homer can't accept the reality of his prosthetic devices. Fred has nightmares from his war experiences. VP Al judges loan applicants by their character, not their collateral. At the Union Club VP Al expresses confidence in the bank's future and small loans to people. Fred's wife complains about the change in Fred's personality since the war. Peggy has ideas for her future, and this surprises her parents. Al talks to Fred to straighten out things. A reactionary shows up at the store and argues with Homer; Fred settles the argument and quits his job. Wilma shows that she has the right stuff.

Fred's wife has decided she wasted the best years of her life, and will change her status. Fred knows when it is time to bail out. Fred visited a junk yard to remember the past, and finds a future: he has a `can do' attitude. At Homer's wedding Millie worries about Al's drinking. Homer and Wilma will live happily ever after. There will be a future for Peggy and Fred too.

This film provides snapshots of life in 1945 America, as seen by Hollywood. The success of this film shows it was acceptable to the American public. It was the greatest success for independent film producer Samuel Goldwyn. This complete film is much better than the censored version shown on broadcast TV.",1168992000,6,2254,4.684343434343434

155331,4,0792846133,"This American masterpiece came as near perfection as popular art contrives to be, from its beautifully equivocal and suggestive title to the magnificent performance elicited by William Wyler from the nonprofessional amputee Harold Russell...

The film epitomized both the dream and the reality of the postwar world... This intimate engagement with the psychological facts of American life gave it an almost universal audience... But, unlike contemporary and preceding ""message"" pictures, it was not a preachment... It showed Americans as they are, presented their problems as they themselves see them, and provided only such solutions--partial, temporary, personal--as they themselves would accept... The picture's values are the values of the people in it...

William Wyler, an outstanding director, triple winner of the best picture Oscar, adds an air of distinction to melodrama, epic and Westerns... With his distinguishing visual style and his taste for solemn material, he gained a reputation as a meticulous, serious artist... Wyler's most adept use of deep-focus reveals the real commitment to emotional content...

The film tells the story of three men coming home from war to a small middle-American community, and find it variously difficult to pick up where they left off... The three heroes are: a middle-aged sergeant (Fredric March), magnificent as the devoted family man who succeeds in breaking the ice with his family; an incisive Air Force captain (Dana Andrews) returning to an unfaithful wife; and a tormented sailor (Harold Russell) who has lost both hands in service, replaced by hooks in real life...

Winner of 7 Academy Awards including Best Picture, ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" is eloquent and compassionate, a deeply personal motion picture with touching wordless homecoming scenes:

- The first words of the sergeant's loving wife when he arrives home unexpectedly: ""I look terrible! It isn't fair of you to burst in on us like this.""

- The involuntarily sob of the sailor's mother when she first sees her son's mechanical hands... She blurts out: ""It's nothing!""

With her dry-martini voice, Myrna Loy combines charmingly her wifely qualities with motherly ones; Teresa Wright is lovely as the sergeant's nice daughter who falls in love with the pilot; Virginia Mayo is harsh as the disloyal flashy blonde wife whose first loves are money and high life; and Cathy O'Donnell is wonderful and sensitive as the sailor's fiance...

The situations and even some of the characters seem a little obvious, but this is a superb example of high-quality film-making in the forties, with smiles and tears cunningly spaced and a film which says what is needed on a vital subject...",1166313600,10,2701,5.27972027972028

Set in a large, fictional, midwestern city, the film tracks the troubles of three veterans as they return to civilian life. Russell is so impressive because he was the real thing...a non-actor amputee vet. The movie is worth seeing for him alone. The Hollywood pros, of course, do good jobs in their roles as well. If your parents or grandparents were young adults in the post-war 1940's, this film will help you understand their experiences. It is fascinating, too, for the cars, the airplanes, the jobs, the courtship rules, and the relation of young adult vets to their parents or partners after years of separation. I think every adult citizen should see it at least once. We have wounded vets returning from war experiences every day in the USA in 2006, and while the nature of work and relationships have changed tremendously in the past 60 years, the fears and joys and hopes and challenges are largely the same.",1159833600,3,1152,4.912820512820513

Each man is given greatest respect, presented to the audience as a noble warrior returned home with a new perspective on who they are and what they want from their lives.

Idealistic, over-simplified?  Sure.  But what's being conveyed through the film isn't intended to be the harsh reality of soldiers and sailors adjusting to life after war.  The purpose of the movie is to embody the nation's love for their fighting men, to say that times may be tough as they adjust, but that the American people recognized the fighting men as heroes to a generation.",1155600000,5,1009,4.803468208092486

155336,5,0792846133,"The Best Years of Our Lives is a film that seems to transcend time itself.  This is one of the best films ever made.  A rich ensemble cast and a compelling, touching story make this a film to treasure and invites repeated viewings, and it isn't hard to see why it won Best Picture in 1946 as well as a high mark on AFI's best films ever made.

The film surrounds three men who are just returning from World War II.  They are Air Force Captain, Fred Derry (Dana Andrews), Sergeant Al Stephenson (Fredric March), and Navy Shipman, Homer Dobkins (Harold Russell).  The film's central plot issue is how these three men are able to re-incorporate themselves back into society.

Fred Derry finds the challenges of getting re-acquainted with his new wife, wonderfully played by Virginia Mayo, and finding a good job, as he was a soda-fountain man before he entered the war.  He also has an estranged relationship with his father who can't seem to express his admiration and affection for his son.  Dana Andrews is wonderful.  His best work is in this film and in the classic thriller, Laura.

Al Stephenson finds his challenges in getting re-aquainted with his family who seem to have grown away from him in the sense that his kids are grown up.  He also finds the challenge of going back to a job as a bank loan officer, a job he hasn't much enthusiasm for, as well as his tendency to drink just a bit too much!  Fredric March is simply brilliant in this film and he justly earned an Oscar for this role.

Finally, there is Homer Parrish, played by real-life veteran with genuine touch and appeal by newcomer Harold Russell (the only actor in Oscar history to receive two Oscars for the same role!).  Word has it that William Wyler was so impressed and touched by Harold's true-to-life war experience which cost him his hands, that he incorporated much of Harold's own experience into the story.

Our three men return to Boone City to vast changes within the town itself.  They are blown away by the commercial boom that seems to have struck.  So much progress has been made that, at first, our heroes wonder just where do they fit in.

Fred quickly discovers that he really doesn't know his wife.  While attractive and appealing physically (especially to other men), he realizes that she's lacking in any real substance.  Nor, apparently, is she interested in him outside of his ""military"" uniform and position.  However, he quickly finds romance with Al Stephenson's young daughter, Peggy (Teresa Wright).  He finds a young woman with genuine feeling who cares deeply for him, especially when she's awakened one night by one of Fred's nightmares.  His wife wonders why he can't just ""get it out of his system,"" while Peggy shows concern and empathy for Fred's plight.  The problem grows more complicated since Fred is married.  The budding relationship between Fred and Peggy doesn't please father Al at all who warns Fred that he will do everything to keep Peggy away from him.  Teresa Wright was one of those wonderful actresses with the perfect blend of beauty and sense of the girl next door.  She wasn't glamorous, and she never had a desire to be.  Her appeal was always in playing very sweet, down-to-earth characters.

Al returns to a loving wife (Myrna Loy), Milly.  Even Milly is wondering what has happened to her husband, who seems more interested in bar-hopping than in recapturing his romance with her.  Al discovers a promotion waiting for him at the bank, but he wonders at what cost?  Especially when he feels compelled to give a ""break"" to a young returning veteran who has no collateral for his loan.  He ends up questioning just where the heart of America is.  Even while intoxicated, Al ends up giving one of the most compelling speeches about the future of America.

Finally, there is Homer Parrish who just wants to be treated like everyone else.  His girlfriend, Wilma (Cathy O'Donnell) tries everything she can think of to convince Homer that she doesn't care about his debilitating condition, but only about him.  It finally takes a truly touching situation for her to finally convince him of this truth.  This is greatly amplified when he finally wraps his arms around her, and she nearly cries out with joy that he's finally done this.

There have been several such films made throughout the history of Hollywood, but none have approached the touching and genuine feeling that this one does.  William Wyler is one of the best directors of all time, in my opinion; the same mastermind behind such classics as ""Mrs. Miniver"" and ""Ben-Hur"".  He has always done compelling and touching stories, and not many directors are able to combine these two elements so successfully.

The movie is nearly 3 hours long, but it never feels like it.  We find that for these three men, the best years of their lives are yet to come because they've overcome all of the odds of war and all of the odds of coming home.",1148774400,13,4921,4.7064327485380115

155349,4,0792846133,"""The Best Years of Our Lives"" aired every Decoration Day - or Memorial Day as it is called in most of the U S - on one of the three TV stations that was available in my small hometown in rural Arkansas.  Memorial Day is a day dedicated to the dead, it would have been better to have aired this movie on Veteran's Day - the day dedicated to the survivors of war.

Fundamentally, this is a tale about war survivors.  The pain that they bear in missing limbs, broken hearts, and lost dreams is the real story.  As the movie starts, we see three veterans returning to their hometown.  These are three men with nothing in common other than their service.  They each have been touched by the war and are trying to find a new way forward.

Homer Parrish (real-life double amputee Harold Russell) of the Navy is the one who bears the physical effects of the war.  Of note, Harold Russell lost his hands in a training accident when he was in the Army Airborne.  He never saw combat and spent the war providing training to other amputees on how to use prosthetics.  In fact, his role in such a training movie talking about how to use prosthetics resulted in him earning this role.  In many ways, Homer has the easiest transition.  He has a wonderful family waiting for him.  He receives generous veterans and disability benefits.  However, he doesn't know how to react to how others react to his disability.  In the end, he shows his girlfriend just how helpless he really is, when she reacts with kindness and love, the journey to happiness can begin.

Al (Fredric March), the sergeant, is a well-to-do bank executive.  He has the most difficult transition.  First, his children grew up while he was gone.  He finds a daughter is a young woman and a son who is smarter and more observant than his father - at least in terms of science and politics if not human behavior.  Additionally, he finds that he has become what we today would call an adrenaline junkie.  Without the constant excitement in war, he finds that he needs alcohol and constant involvement from his family.  Additionally, years of making snap judgments in combat have made him a little more impulsive than his bank might enjoy.  Al has one of the best stories about not taking a hill and losing the war that I've ever heard.

Air Force Captain Fred Derry (Dana Andrews), a soda jerk, is a man who married a girl he hardly knew two weeks before he left for war.  He returns to find his wife did not share any allotment money with his dirt poor family.  He also finds that she has been somewhat less than the perfect wife.  War was a chance for this handsome, charming man to become a natural leader.  Peace has a dead end job and a loveless marriage.  To my mind, Fred is a lot like the folks from my part of rural Arkansas who lived in a more equitable and opportunity filled world when in combat than existed when they returned home at the end of their service.

There is a lot of star quality in this movie.  Either you will recognize the names or you won't, but the script obviously attracted big names to take bit parts.

The title is very meaningful.  What were the best years of these men's lives?  Was it during the war or has the best yet to come?",1136592000,15,3214,4.400679117147708

Some of the old Chaplin stuff is next.

Watched Best Years of Our Lives (1946) with Myrna Loy last night. Long, but excellent film about three WWII veterans returning home to their women and jobs.

Considering that this was made a year after WWII ended, and one of the soldiers is severally maimed, this is an excellent portrait of people's real day-to-day lives. Winner of seven Academy Awards, including best picture, director, actor and screenplay, William Wyler's brilliant drama about adjustment is one of the all-time classics of American cinema. It spans a complex range of honest emotions, from joyous celebration and happy reunion to deep-rooted ambivalence and reassessment of personal priorities.

In vivid contrast to the gorgeous lighting, which decorates The Cook et, all as if every scene is a carnival show, this B&W movie illuminates every nook and cranny. All the rooms are sunny and happy, as if it is always mid-day: even the closet is lit, casting shadows into the room. The effect is the raw wood of truth; unvarnished reality for those three men and the women who love them.

Deus ex machine is a Greek and Roman dramatic trick, where a god/person/machine suddenly resolves the plot, extricating the protagonist from a difficult situation: in Westerns, the cavalry arrives to save the day. In a brilliant reversal of deus ex machine, the director shows just how much he really was involved in every nuance of this personal story.

Long before special effects, Hollywood relied more on dialogue, emotional acting and sheer entertainment talent to tell a story. Here the director changed the script to employ a severally disabled non-actor, Harold Russell (in his one and only film role) as a sailor who lost both hands in an explosion. During the film, you marvel as Russell uses his metal hooks, but never see his arms without them. The director wisely keeps this for the end.

In a pivotal scene, the maimed Russell removes the machinery (his hands) from the plot, revealing his all too human self.

I hate when great books are made into mediocre movies (even though I have to see them). I hate when great movies are redone into mediocre ones. Yet I think this movie needs to be redone. If Dracula can be on stage, this movie might even be possible to reprise on the stage.

This movie needs to be redone because:

&#61553; as a war movie without violence, it is real and relevant today

&#61553; history has forgotten the actors

&#61553; the vintage small town footage is quaint, but outdated

&#61553; it needs updating: the risqu of divorce for example is gone

&#61553; the lighting makes it look as if the whole thing was shot on a sound stage

It tells the story of 3 servicemen coming home after the war and the adjustments they faced as they tried to resume life with their family, friends and employment. The pacing of the film is relaxing, allowing for ample character development.  The viewer is willingly drawn into the film by such methods as real town street scenes taken from the taxi window as the men share their first ride home after years of being away and also by the use of a non-professional actor as one of the main characters.

155352,5,0792846133,"Sometimes the studio system awes one with its ability to have everyone work together in harmony to create something unforgettable.  Producer Samuel Goldwyn and director William Wyler collaborated with writer Robert E. Sherwood to make THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES (1946). All three won Oscars.  The film is a towering masterpiece set in small town America (actually Cleveland) right after World War Two ends.  Returning home are Al Stephenson (Fredric March) of the Army, Fred Derry (Dana Andrews) of the Air Force, and Homer Parrish (real-life double amputee and non-professional Harold Russell) of the Navy.  Al has wife Milly (Myrna Loy) and two kids, while Homer has a family and sweet girl friend Wilma (Cathy O'Donnell).  Luckless Fred has a newlywed wife (Virginia Mayo) who was unfaithful while her husband was overseas.

THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES burned up the 1946 Oscars, winning Picture, Director, Screenplay, March as Actor, and two for Russell.  Hugo Friedhofer's legendary score also won a richly deserved trophy.  It is a long film, 170 minutes, but beautifully paced and leisurely, capturing the slow tempo of a more quiet time.  Those wanting something fast and flashy should rent THE FRENCH CONNECTION (1971).  The performances are superb down to the bit roles.

THE BEST YEARS captures to perfection the way that returning veterans wanted their old jobs back--Al at the bank, Fred in a drugstore--when other people now had those jobs and resented the vets.  The guys all keep gathering at Butch's (Hoagy Carmichael) bar to rap about life.  Meanwhile, Fred has a frustrating dilemma besides losing his drugstore job.  With an unfaithful wife who insists that her husband wear a uniform he no longer wants to wear, he finds himself drawn romantically to the Stephenson daughter (Teresa Wright).  The Stephensons do everything to stop that, partly to placate the censor board.

The movie has vignettes more than a strong plot--Al being quizzed by his bank boss on why a particular loan was made, Homer and his father taking off his artificial limbs in a night bedroom, Al wandering through a field of airplanes about to become scrap metal for homes, and an especially lovely reel one scene in a plane cockpit with all three men looking down on their town.  Backing everything are Gregg Toland's stunning deep focus B&W photography and Hugo Friedhofer's magnificent music score.

The DVD transfer seems excellent, even with minimal bonuses, for one of the greatest films ever made.  THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES.  Treat yourself to it when you have a three hour time slot and want to know authentically what post-World War Two small town life was like.

155353,5,0792846133,"This epic should be required viewing for all US Citizens, as it is one of the truest portraits ever made of the immediate Post World War 2 America. Too often the WW II pictures that were made in the Post War years of the 1950's whitewashed the many issues that returning veterans, their famalies, and for that matter the entire nation faced as the war ended.

This movie was made just after the war ended, and it was probally made just in time to have kept it so real.

A trio of returning Vets comes back to their mid-western ""any town USA"" to start their lives anew. Fredrich March as the returning banker questions where his priorities should be almost from the day that he lands back at work.  Dana Andrews, the highest ranking amoung them made a name for himself in the military, but is faced with a less than ideal work situation back home, and has a very indifferent wife played by Virginia Mayo.  Harold Russell plays the amputee of the trio (he lost his hands in the war), and faces life in a nation without any of the protections that the disabled now have.

Meanwhile the tale is woven with everthing from jealousy expressed about the Vets from those who remained at home and now fear loosing their jobs to them, to the anxiety that a new war could break out any day. This era in US history was hardly ideal and this movie is brutally honest as few Hollywood epics are.

Myrna (Thin Man) Loy and Teresa Wright round out the oustanding cast.

True this movie does have the Holloywood Happy Ending, but it still left enough unanswered questions to keep people thinking.

155356,5,0792846133,"This is an absolutely tremendous motion picture about guys returning from WWII, focusing on the scars they carry both inside and out.  Fredric March earned a Best Actor Oscar in the role of a banker who served as a sergeant in the infantry and has a drinking problem; his boss and his family are incredibly supportive, yet he just can't stop fighting the war in some ways.  True war casualty Harold Russell, who lost his hands in a training accident, was not a professional actor, yet he creditably portrayed a sailor who can deal with having hooks but can't deal with the way other people treat him as a man with no fingers; he was, after all, essentially portraying himself.  (Mr. Russell is now one of my heroes; he went on after his Best Supporting Actor Oscar for this film to form the AMVETS organization.)

Dana Andrews portrays the other returning soldier and, while he was the odd man out at award time, his part as the captain flyboy from a poor background is equally well drawn and played.  Turning his whirlwind wartime wedding into a happy marriage to a beautiful blonde (Virgnia Mayo) is just one of the challenges he must face; the others include returning to his humble drugstore job after the glamour of piloting, and the fierce temptation of the attraction he feels to the banker's daughter (Teresa Wright).

Seldom does a film from this era (1946) have this kind of depth of characterization and fully fleshed-out situations.  This is no pretty-boy movie star vehicle; this is as close to ""Band Of Brothers"" type reality as the studios could get in those days of the Hays code.  Add in the terrific camera work by the man who photographed ""Citizen Kane"" and you've got a tremendous film with an awesome cast.

155357,5,0792846133,"Much has been made recently about ""The Greatest Generation,"" the generation that came of age during the deprivation of the Great Depression and the horrors of World War II. (Having parents who were both born in 1920, and who both served their country during WWII, I believe the title of ""The Greatest Generation"" is utterly appropriate.) It may have been ""Saving Private Ryan"" that brought that generation's struggles to the forefront of their children's and grandchildren's minds; but, for my money, the best film about those who fought WWII came out only one year after the war's end. ""The Best Years of Our Lives""--directed by William Wyler, that sanest and most humane of directors--is the deeply moving story of an infantry sergeant, an Air Force pilot and a sailor returning to their Midwestern home town from the war, and how the war changed them for better and for worse. Al (Fredric March), the sergeant, is a well-to-do bank executive who finds that his Army experience has greatly changed his perception of the people who come to his bank for a loan. Fred (Dana Andrews) finds life at home stultifying after service in a combat squadron, stuck in his old dead-end job as a soda jerk with a wife who has grown away from him. Most poignant of all is Homer, a young sailor who lost his hands in combat. Homer is played by Harold Russell, a real-life double amputee, who gives Homer's feelings of loss and displacement a you-are-there immediacy that is truly heartrending. Giving performances of equal excellence to the three male leads are Myrna Loy and Teresa Wright as March's wife and daughter; Virginia Mayo as Andrews' faithless wife; and Cathy O'Donnell as the girl Russell left behind. (The look on Loy's face when she first sees her husband home safely makes for one of the most moving scenes in all American cinema.) Literate and character-driven, ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" never tries to dazzle us; it just brings home the reality of these characters and their predicaments with quietly devastating force. This film won seven Oscars and deserved every last one of them, including Best Picture, Best Director for Wyler, Best Actor for March and Best Supporting Actor for Russell. It is amazing that so measured and insightful a film about the plight of returning GIs could have been filmed so soon after the war; but ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" is an enduring and fitting monument to America's servicemen and servicewomen, the sacrifices they make for their country, and the debt their country owes them.",1118361600,23,2527,4.865429234338747
155378,5,0792846133,"This is a truely memorable film.  What makes it even better is that it was a WWII film but could be about the aftermath of soldiers returning home after any subsequent war.

William Wyler was a master at his craft.  And he had the ability to get a great cast together.  These are A actors past their stardom and B actors that never got a chance to show what they had.  This film showcases them all.

Fredric March won his second Oscar as a vetran returning home.  He adds depth and passion to his charachter.

Myrna Loy once again showed us why every actor wanted her to play his spouse.  She creates her own character while adding dimensions to her husband.

Four years after her first Wyler film, Mrs. Miniver, Teresa Wright showed she was no flash in the pan.  Her performace as the daughter, had a fine line to walk and she did it to perfection.

B actors Dana Andrews and Virginia Mayo play the marry in haste couple.  Neither actor had a better chance to show they could handle more difficult roles.

Of course the find was newcomer, Harold Russell.  This first time actor without any formal training played his role of the truest victim of war.  The soldier who came back with the loss of his arms.  He truely deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar.

In the end, you will be moved by this portrait of soldiers returning home after The Great War.",1117843200,5,1354,4.434959349593496
155379,5,0792846133,"Film Review of The Best Years of Our Lives

When the Best Years of Our Lives was released in 1946, circumstances were quite different then what they are today. America had just ushered in the age of nuclear warfare with its use of the A-Bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Although World War II had just ended, there was now a new and more immediate sense of uncertainty about our future.

The title of the film refers to the fact that many young servicemen spent the best years of their lives dealing with the horrors and struggles of World War II. Many of these returning

servicemen were to face additional challenges as they attempted to re-enter American society.

The film focuses on three World War II veterans who are returning to their hometown of Boone City after spending several years actively engaged in military service.

The first is infantryman Al Stephenson, who is a banker married for over twenty years with two children. The second is Air Force Captain Fred Derry, a soda jerk, who married a girl he hardly knew two weeks before he left for war.  The third is Seaman Homer Parish who had proposed my mail to his high school sweetheart during his active service. Homer is now reconsidering his proposal because he lost hands in the line of duty. He is apprehensive of his fiancee's, reaction to his prosthetic hooks.  While Homer's injuries are the only visible ones, each of the men have psychological scars.

The movie follows these servicemen from their anxieties on the trip home, through their arrival, and the trials and readjustment to civilian life.  Servicemen are often challenged to completely reintegrate themselves into a prior lifestyle while conveniently putting the horrors of war behind them.  These three servicemen returned home with the same dream of getting back to the lives they left. However, the reality was very different.  Relationships were strained because couples were separated for years while being subjected to stressful and trying circumstances.

Children matured during war to the point that some servicemen no longer recognized their own children when they returned.

Grief for the loss of loved ones weighed heavily families. Marriages, sometimes started on an impulse before a man went to war overseas, failed. War II forever changed the make-up of the American work force when women stepped in to uniquely male roles in the male's absence.

Some women discovered that working was a liberating experience and they felt independent for the first time in their lives. It was very difficult for servicemen to find jobs with post-war

production cutbacks. These servicemen suffered flashbacks, anxiety and perhaps a feeling of betrayal that America did not wait for them.

The film's characters return from their wartime roles to their homes and are faced with domestic problems, uncertainties, conflicts and new situations.  Homer, who still lives with his

parents, is met with mixed joy and discomfort.  While his mother and father are overjoyed to see him, there are moments of awkwardness when they have to acknowledge his handicap.  His

fiancee is very happy to see him and displays no alarm or disgust at his handicap.  Yet Homer's feelings of inadequacy and perhaps self-loathing are displayed on his face when he cannot bring himself to return his loving fiancee's embrace.

When Al comes home,  his wife Milly, daughter Peggy and son Pat are all there to welcome him.  Al realizes he's missed quite a bit during the war years, especially the maturing of his children: ""I've seen nothing. I should have stayed home and found out what was really going on.""  He feels uncomfortable that his daughter has taken on the role of the housemaid/cook

after taking a course in domestic science and buying a cookbook. He perceives that his children have grown up and grown distant. His bewilderment is summed up when he comments ""What happened to this family?  All this atomic energy and scientific efficiency.""

Peggy's attempt to comfort her confused father are exemplified in the following scene:

Peggy:  Nice to have you around, dad.  You'll get us back to normal.

Father:  Or maybe go nuts myself.

Fred finds himself in front of his parent's home, which is a dilapidated shack next to the railroad tracks.  His stepmother and father admire all the medals on his uniform.  Fred is anxious to find out where his wife Marie is.  He learns from his parents that she moved out and took a job at a nightclub.  He is clearly surprised to find out that she doesn't live at the house and that she has a job.  He immediately leaves to go and find her without staying to eat dinner.  It is indicative of Fred's frustration (and perhaps anger) that he tries to find his wife without knowing where she works.

Fred's wife Marie is the character who coped the best with the strains and changes that the war brought about.  Marie met Fred in basic training camp in Texas and was only married to Fred for two weeks before the war started.  Marie did not know him or his family, when she moved to Boone City to live with Fred's parents during the war.  Marie showed that she was a strong and independent women by going out and getting a job and moving into her own apartment.  Marie did not want to be a burden to Fred's family, they had a very small apartment.

She did not want to inconvenience them with the late hours that she was working at the nightclub.  It was not easy for a woman to live by herself in 1946 and to find a job making a decent wage.  The community did not think that it was natural or normal for a woman to work before the war, some continued to feel this way during the war.

The character that had the most difficulty adjusting to post-war life was Homer.  Homer cannot get close to anyone. He senses others uncertainty about how to handle his disability, and it causes him to retreat from emotional contact.  Homer lacks self-confidence and remains isolated from his parents and fiance. He and his fiance meet in the garage where Homer has

been firing a gun and finally talk about their relationship.

Neighborhood playmates of his sister peer through the garage window.  Frustrated that he is the object of their conversation, he fumbles to open the doorknob with his hooks.  ""You want to see how the hooks work? Do you want to see the freak? All right, I'll show you ya!"" He smashes his two hook-fists through the glass window, this is something that a person with hands would never do, and he shouts: ""Take a

good look.""  There were not any films that had showed someone with this type of disability previously.

This film was ahead of its time with the scene of Homer and Wilma in his bedroom.  Many of the film's scenes take place in bedrooms. It was not mainstream to have a male and female together in a bedroom.  If they were shown together it would suggest that something romantic had, or would occur.  It was taboo to show anything suggesting sexual contact in a film

of that era. Homer invites his fiancee to come upstairs and watch what happens when he goes to bed.  She follows him upstairs to his bedroom where he is able to be intimate with her.

Again, it was not common in 1946 Hollywood for such an overt invitation to make a final cut of a movie. It was even more rare for the invitee to accept. Yet this scene was vital to the storyline because it clearly demonstrated that love can overcome misfortune and disability. It showed how vulnerable and helpless the bitter Homer could be once he took of his hooks. He stands helplessly in front of her with what is left of his arms and wiggles into his pajama top as  Wilma calmly observes.  He is unable to button his pajama top, so Wilma lovingly buttons it for him.  Wilma says, ""I love you and I'm never going to leave you, never."" She wraps her arms around his neck and kisses him. She tucks him into bed and covers him up.  She kisses him goodnight, turns out the light, and leaves the door ajar as she leaves.

This scene was reflective of the changes that American families had undergone as a result of World War II, because it showed the woman being strong and independent. Wilma followed Homer upstairs to his bedroom and never gave it a second thought.  She was not afraid to watch him take off his robe, and his hooks.  She was assertive in buttoning his pajama top for him.  She tucked him into bed and she kissed him goodnight.  She told him that she loved him.  The War made women stronger because they had to go to work to support themselves and their families

while contributing to the war effort.  They became more self-reliant, independent and able to make decisions for themselves and their family.

My favorite scene in the movie is when Al, Fred, and Homer are in the taxi coming home and enter Boone City for the first time in years.  We can see by the expressions on their faces that they are nervous, anxious, excited and filled with anticipation all at the same time.  The characters note the little things that have changed (Homer's cousin, Butch, has a new neon sign

outside his bar) and those things that have remained the same (the same men are on the golf course, just like nothing happened).  We can feel the emotions that they are

experiencing.

Everyone who has been away from home after a long absence experiences similar emotions. Why this was my favorite scene, is because it shows that they can still express emotions after seeing the horrors of war. This film meant a lot to me, because it helped me to understand more clearly my mother who was born March 25, 1943 and others of her generation.

I saw this when I rented it first on video and then bought the vidoe. I am not sure how the quality would transfer over on DVD.

155380,4,0792846133,"Without a shred of doubt World War II has become one of the perennial subjects of the modern mega-motion picture era. Within the last three decades the Motion Picture Association has rewarded numerous films which relate to the Second World War with the recognition of either being nominated for or winning a golden statuette, among those include The Last Emperor, Patton, The English Patient, and Saving Private Ryan, directed by Steven Spielberg who also helmed the Academy Award-winning Schindler's List. In spite of losing out on Best Picture to Shakespeare in Love, Spielberg enthusiasm for the subject of World War II gave rise to the HBO mini-series, Band of Brothers, which he produced along with Tom Hanks, garnering numerous Emmy awards in its wake. Even cult-director Quentin Tarantino, the man behind such classics as Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, will be getting into the act with his next film, Inglorious Bastards. But what few filmmakers, let alone the studio executives willing to produce them, have taken the actual time to create a film focused on the returning soldier to the life he left behind when he went off to war and how war changes everything, even long after the guns have silenced.

The story for The Best Years of Our Lives, with its flagrantly honest dialogue and emotionally gripping situations, stands out prominently amongst other films of the war genre, both today and the time period in which it was released. Unlike other war pictures, which frequently rely on ordinary individuals being thrown into intense situations, or vice-versa, this film's primary interest lies with three ordinary men, whose only interest in the war was to perform to the best of their ability the duty which was required of them from both their families and their country, readjusting themselves to their former lifestyles and the difficulties they encounter through this transitional period in their lives. Few if any truly nullifying comments can be made directly about the script or its storyline, but one which can be suggested is that its three hour time length feels a bit much to handle within one sitting and the events which are spaced out quite a bit over the course of the film could have easily been condensed into a more reasonably-sized movie.

Having been produced and released in time to be recognized by the Motion Picture Association in 1946, a little over a year since World War II officially ended with the surrender of the Japanese to the United States, it is right to assume that the events which are represented within the film as well as the styles and the fashions of the time are depicted accurately. But what needs to be addressed more carefully goes beyond the level of merely analyzing clothing and trends of this particular era in American history and involves the way in which the veterans returning home from the war are depicted.

With a little over fifteen months under their belt following the end of the war, it is hard to believe that the filmmakers in this time period were able to write up a script, arrange for the studio to produce it, film the project, edit it, distribute the reels to theaters, and release the feature within that short span of time. It is more like that at least a portion of the film's production, script-writing or casting, were done prior to the official end of the global conflict. The audience, not to mention the message which the film expresses concerning veterans readjusting to the home-front, may have benefited more from the experience had it been completed over a period of years following the conclusion of the Second World War. This would have allowed the screenwriters to have accurately depicted the experiences of soldiers returning to civilian life and the long-term difficulties they encountered.

Fredric March undoubtedly steals the spotlight away, for at least the first one-third of the picture, from anyone else within the cast in the often bumbling, yet still paternalistic and lovable, role of Al Stephenson, the former banker who returns home to his wife and two children and must adjust to civilian life after the war. Sadly, as entertaining as March's performance was in providing ample amounts of comic-relief early on within the picture, it does take quite a bit of time for a point to be made concerning his character and even then it remains difficult for its audience to determine exactly what is being distinguished between him and veterans similar to his state following the war.

Dana Andrews provides an admirable performance in the role of Fred Derry, a fighter-pilot in the war who returns home to find that his wife has relocated to an apartment and interacts with him in such a manner which demands of him to immediately pick up where life left off without so much as an afterthought as to his experiences in the war. In spite of his performance, Andrews' appearance comes off as too ""pretty boyish"", which makes it difficult for a majority of war veterans who were not Clark Gable or Elvis Presley returning from conflict to easily connect with his character. Furthermore, he was not altogether convincing within a specific scene in the film in which he dreams about his experiences in combative aerial battles and the horrifying images of comrades being shot down or burning up in their cockpits which were burned into his mind. Fault partially lies with the screenwriters, as they limit the discussion of the topic to only a few scenes, some of which it is barely mentioned outside of passing conversation, and truly should have been divulged into more then it was. What can a modern-war veteran, from either Iraq or Afghanistan, derive from the character of Fred Derry which would benefit in their return to civilian life? Are the filmmakers trying to suggest that every soldier who marries his sweetheart before heading off to battle will deeply regret upon his return? It would be rash as to associate the intentions of the screenwriters with the assumptions picked up in the film, it is certainly intriguing to consider.

Easily one of the most heralding performances in the film is given by Harold Russell, a real life veteran of World War II who lost his hands in the service of his country, for his role as Homer Parrish, a man returning home from war to face the trials of his new condition which await him upon being reunited with his loved ones. In having an actual serviceman of the Second World War fill into the role of the most gripping and emotionally demanding performances in the film, as far as the audience is concerned, benefits both the picture as a whole as well as the actor who portrays him. It would be quite intriguing, not to mention invaluable to the audiences watching this film, to discover how much of Homer Parrish's dialogue or actions throughout the picture were scripted or were improvised by Russell, a person who would clearly have more to express within the role far beyond anything the screenwriters could ever dictate for him. The lone complaint which could be made relating to the character of Homer Parrish does not concern Russell's performance but rather the way in which the screenwriters' crafted the character throughout the script. In spite of the insight its audience gains from limiting the point-of-view of Homer's adjustment to life with his recent disability to the serviceman himself, the film certainly could have broadened the perspective of the situation by including the actions and emotional thoughts of his girlfriend, Wilma, but its exclusion does not necessarily hamper its affect on the audience.

Overall, The Best Years of Our Lives is truly a sight for the sore eyes of those who have become so accustomed to the clichd dramatics of the Hollywood war picture, back in the time it was released as well as today. The film lacks nearly every single aspect one would associate with a tinsel town show stopper - star power, glitz, glamour, that certain ""movie magic"" - but in eminent defiance of the odds it performs brilliantly without them. There are those who would raise complaint that the film's atmosphere is overtly pessimistic, but there would certainly be greater disapproval had the filmmakers chosen a more ""rose-colored"" approach to the sensitive material presented. True, there is a lot to be upset about in this picture, whether it is unfair or simply as aspect of life we must learn to accept and move on, but thankfully enough room is left at the end for the characters onscreen to glimpse the horizon ahead and realize that hope is not as far away as it may seem. The cinematography is positively breathtaking, the performances conducted by a group of nearly unknown actors and actresses are brilliantly superb, the dialogue is insightful and expressive, and its message of optimism and hope in the eyes of the returning war veteran truly stands the test of time, as relevant today as it was back then.",1113955200,6,8902,4.895294897282969
155381,5,0792846133,"This excellent movie is about three soldiers returning home after WW II and their attempts at adjustment; one of them has no hands. Frederic March, Dana Andrews, and Harold Russell play the 3 soldiers: March is a banker who isn't sure he wants his old job back; Andrews comes home to an empty nest and few prospects; Russell, who was a non-professional actor and had lost both hands on D-Day, is the man with the hooks who feels society viewing him as a freak. The picture is a bit long at 170 minutes, but there is some great drama here, too. The scene with Andrews in the cockpit of the scrapped bomber is terrific, and Russell's portrayal is complex, poignant, and powerful. How affecting this movie must be/have been to people of the War generation! Captured a slew of Oscars and deservedly so. Definitely worth a watch.",1112140800,,824,4.612244897959184
155382,5,0792846133,"With the recent deaths of Teresa Wright and Virginia Mayo, it gives a compelling reason to revisit one of the finest of American films, a deserved classic that focuses on the challenges faced by returning WWII veterans. Directed by William Wyler, a master at capturing the spectrum of human behavior no matter the size of his canvas, this poignant 1946 film focuses on three men, all affected deeply by their wartime experiences. Ostensibly a period piece, the film's emotionalism continues to resonate and even takes on a burnished quality because of its uncommon honesty during a time that could have easily been made rose-colored by the Hollywood studio system.

As the oldest of the trio, Fredric March portrays Al Stephenson, an Army sergeant, who comes home to his picture-perfect family - a loyal wife (Myrna Loy in her typical role) and two well-adjusted children. Even with such an idyllic life awaiting him, he becomes conflicted about how life has changed during his absence from the home front. Perhaps released too soon after Billy Wilder's blistering classic about alcoholism, ""The Lost Weekend"", the film dances around Al's heavy drinking which could have been an interesting angle to explore. Although March won his second Oscar for this role, I feel the film's most impressive performance actually comes from Dana Andrews, who plays Air Force bombardier Fred Derry caught between a loveless marriage to good-time gal Marie (Mayo) and a growing attraction toward Peggy, Al's fresh-scrubbed daughter (Wright). The third man is sailor Homer Parrish, portrayed in an honest, unaffected manner by real-life double amputee Harold Russell. Although it looks like the movie will focus primarily on Al's situation, Wyler cleverly shifts the story to Fred in the second half since he is the one who faces the most uncertain future. Homer's story is interspersed throughout. But what brings the film together is the palpable sense of disquiet experienced by all three in trying to assimilate into their former lives. Homer has the most obvious challenge as he faces others' discomfort in handling his disability. There is a heartbreaking scene where Russell smashes his artificial hooks through a window out of sheer frustration and terrifies his young sister to plead for forgiveness.  But the most powerful scenes belong to Andrews who faces the humiliation of going back to his pre-war soda jerk job, then slowly realizes how superficial his wife is and what he must do to build his life again, perfectly symbolized by his halting walk through a massive, desolate graveyard of junked WWII airplanes.

The irony of the movie's title refers to the irretrievable fact that many servicemen experienced their best years in wartime, not in conforming their lives to peacetime as they get reacquainted with their loved ones.  It's a significant distinction treated gently by Wyler and screenwriter Robert E. Sherwood. The almost-three-hour running time goes by quickly, as one feels a true sense of empathy for all the characters, even Mayo's floozy who has more under the surface than one would suspect. Special mention needs to be given to Cathy O'Donnell's touching performance as Wilma, Homer's innocent and accepting fiance.  Sterling work from a bygone era.",1110844800,8,3265,5.1878557874762805
155383,5,0792846133,"This is one picture that I never tire of after repeated viewings and I have seen this picture MANY times over the years.
This pictures' theme which centers around the trials and tribulations of three WW2 vets returning home and their efforts to reintegrate back into civilian life is as timeless as the picture itself. And it plays as well today and speaks the same truths as it did back in 1946.
Director William Wyler did a masterful job of keeping everything taut and focused as the movie unfolds before us.
Harold Russell who plays a navy vet whose hands and forearm have been lost in an aboard ship battle won two Oscars for his portrayal. And this for a man who really had no formal training as an actor. He landed the part after being spotted in a Naval training film explaining how he lost his appendages.
Dana Andrews did a wonderful job playing the returning AAF bombardier. His moods and reactions to an unwelcoming civilan population hit the mark everytime.
And screen veteran Frederic March playing an army sergeant I thought stole the picture on many occasions. He infused his character with just the right combination of emotions. His is the one we see with the most potential for an easy re-entry into society but as time progresses it's painfully obvious he is dealing with as much ""crap"" as his two other friends. All three have their own seperate stories which unfold wonderfully but all are inextricably bound by their attempts to just be accepted for who they are now,not what they were. They don't necessarily want to forget their pasts(how can they?),they just want to move on.
And as we watch them we empathise and sympathize with them all the way. The picture works on so many levels with the characters touching us all in some small way that it easily elevates it above your average run of the mill war picture.
And it's easy to see why this picture hit home poignantly touching a nationwide nerve just after the war.
The movie is rounded out by a stellar supporting cast as I can find no real fault with any of them from relatives to children. All played it straight down the middle and under Wylers'  hand give no more nor no less than each scene needed. Watch out for brief and uncredited cameos by bigband leader Gene Krupa singer and Anita O'Day.
This is one movie that is a must see AND must own. It clocks in at  an impressive 170 minutes but you find yourself so engrossed with the plot and characters that in the end it seems more like 70 minutes. One of the best movies ever made and in my top ten.",1110153600,2,2534,4.518518518518518

Perhaps, I am being a bit biased, having known the late composer, as well as having produced the LP and 2 CD versions of the original score, recorded by the London Philharmonic in 1978.

Friedhofer's music is such an integral part of this film that it is not possible to imagine 'BYOOL' without it. Listen, for example, as to how the composer treats several disperate scenes with his bittersweet 'Americana'-imbued score [influences of Copland (naturally), Gershwin, and the second-movement of Elliott Carter's First Symphony (1942), the latter of which was known to Friedhofer].

155387,5,0792846133,"""The Best Years of our Lives"" is a ""Wartme"" classic set in an eponymous Midwestern town immediately after WW2. Firmly directed by William Wyler, it concerns the struggles of 3 returning veterans to readjust to civilian life - and to their families. The leads are Fredric March, Dana Andrews and Harold Russell.  Mr. Russell plays a disabled vet who in real life was a disabled Navy seaman. The pace of BY is leisurely, giving the cast time to ""adjust"" to their surroundings. Viewers should not notice the nearly 3 hour run time.  Andrews has the most difficult adjustment, coming home to a wife he doesn't know and who had plainly been unfaithful during his absence. Vietnam era vets will quickly surmise that ""Jody"" had been around! One aches for Andrews as he returns to work at that cloying drug store, unable to find a better spot. There are few jobs for ex fighter pilots! March has the most nuanced role, since he is an ""old married man"" with a wife and kids. His wife, Myrna Loy, is strong and faithful. She will have to be! March too, is less than enthusiastic about returning to his bank job. Credit his grandfatherly boss, Ray Collins, for not only holding a job for him but also handing him a promotion! March has a painfully obvious struggle with the bottle and is a lucky man to have such a great boss and patient wife! March needs all the support he can get when the unhappily married Andrews gets involved with his daughter! She is ""good girl"" Teresa Wright. The most interesting role is Russell's. Wounded in real life when his aircraft carrier was attacked, he was discovered by Director William Wyler at a War Bond rally. The most touching moment in BY is when Russell shows fiance Cathy O' Donnell how is hand hooks work. BY swept the 1946 Academy Awards winning Best Picture, Director (Wyler), Best Actor (March), Best Supporting Actor (Russell), Best Screenplay, and Best Dramatic Score. Russell was also given a Special Award for ""bringing hope and courage to his fellow veterans"". He remains the only actor to receive 2 awards for the same role. It's too bad that Andrews and Loy went empty handed.  Both quietly played their roles to perfection, especially Loy in dealing with a hard husband struggling to settle down. A final compliment should be given to Virginia Mayo, Andrew's bad girl wife. It's hard playing such a witchy woman but she does to virtual perfection. Viewers should observe Wyler's camera work. BY is shot in deep focus: there is almost always action in the rear of a scene, especially in that awful drugstore! Credit goes to Mike Mayo's ""War Movies"" for that observation and the background on Mr. Russell. BY is highly recommended. It captures the way we were in a very special time in this country's history. Amazoners are encouraged to devote 165 minutes to watching it. The beauty of video is that one can watch over 2 or 3 sittings. This reviewer was tempted to deduct a star for that absolutely hokey fadeout, which is not divulged here.

155399,5,0792846133,"A winner of seven out of the eight Academy Awards it was nominated for, 1946's THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES was the biggest box-office draw since 1939's GONE WITH THE WIND.  Unlike many old hits, though, BEST YEARS holds up remarkably well.

  It's hard to know where to begin when you want to praise everything.  The script is honest, and in its honesty avoids some obvious dramatic highpoints.  There are times when most movies would have troubled characters, and the three returning vets are all working through complicated readjustments, collide and explode in a Big Emotional scene.

 For instance: infantry sergeant/civilian banker Frederic March returns to a wife he loves and two children who have grown into young adults in his absence.  He gives his teenage son a Japanese flag and samurai sword, but the son is more interested in atomic energy and jet propulsion and whether the world is going to be blown to smithereens in the next war.  The maid left three years ago and daughter Teresa Wright has replaced her after taking a few domestic science classes.  It's not the family he left, and he registers his distress by pacing, smoking.  Sit down, dear, wife Myrna Loy says.  You'll be more comfortable.  I'm comfortable enough standing, March says.  Say, can't a fellow get a drink in this house?

 It was right around then, early in the movie, that I thought the film would deliver the first Big Emotional scene.  A fight between Loy and March, perhaps.  And then it fooled me.  March suggests Loy and Wright and he paint the town red to ""Let me know I'm alive.""  And away they go, visiting one nightclub after the other, March's character getting tipsier and tipsier.  The opportunity for the BE scene continued to build.

 Then they enter Butch's (Hoagy Carmichael) caf. The inebriated March asks Hoagy to play an old tune and asks his wife to dance and the scene series ends with shots of them dancing, cut with medium close ups of the actors' faces radiating quiet bliss.

  Frankly, I think this is a brilliant movie that is almost perfectly constructed.

  One oddity.  Harold Russell, a real life war veteran who lost both hands in the war, won two Oscars in 1947 (the only time that's ever happened, by the way); one for Supporting Actor, and an honorary one ""For bringing hope and courage to his fellow veterans through his appearance in The Best Years of Our Lives.""  Russell is a very good natural actor, and the scene in which he shows his fiance, played by Cathy O'Donnell, how he has to prepare for bed that is as moving as anything I've ever seen.

  The oddity - the extra on this disk is a theatrical trailer and Russell's character doesn't appear in it.  The trailer was probably made before the movie was released, but it seems strange that they wouldn't have included him at all.",1097280000,12,2812,4.678936605316974
155400,5,0792846133,"Nowadays it seems almost unthinkable for a movie about everyday people with (sort of) everyday problems to have a run time of close to 3 hours.  Maybe half that! Anything longer is an epic and it better be about extraordinary men and women living extraordinary lives, preferably, against the backdrop of a particularly tumultuous historical era--or a futuristic/fantastic one. But William Wyler's 1946 classic BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES about the difficulties experienced by WWII vets upon re-enterring civilian life somehow manages to tell the tale of ordinary men and women in the years after an extraordinary historical era and to keep the viewer engrossed throughout its entire 172 minutes.  In fact, it could almost stand to be a little longer.
I say that because upon watching it again recently, it occurred to me that the storyline around the returning middle-aged vet (Fredric March) seems to get dropped midway through.  His initial discomfort on rejoining his wife and reacquainting himself with his now grown children could likely have been explored in more depth.  On his first night home, he drags his wife (Myrna Loy) and daughter (Teresa Wright) out for a night on the town, a celebration that involves way too much drinking and definitely makes the women characters uncomfortable.
From a 21st century perspective, the readjustment of a middle aged vet seems potentially as interesting a storyline as that of his younger comrades in arms.  But in short order, the focus shifts to the plights of those two younger vets (Dana Andrews as the bombadier reduced to resuming his job in a drug store and Harold Russell as a double amputee, struggling to adjust to life with prosthetics and recked with doubts about his suitablity for marriage to longtime sweetheart Wilma (Cathy O'Donnell), the patient and giving girl next door).  The night-on-the-town in fact, pretty much becomes a plot device to introduce Dana Andrews' character to March's daughter, which initiates another storyline involving the mutual attraction between the unhappily married Andrews and the impressionable Wright.
Nowadays, with material this rich, they'd make a mini-series.  That wasn't an option back then, and thank goodness for it. BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES works best as a leisurely paced work of cinema.  Contemporary viewers may actually be surprised to see so many post-war themes developed so immediately post-war.  Frankness about matters such as divorce, disability and the psychological ramifications of war may seem a little surprising for 1946.  One might have thought that after suffering through the Depression and the Second World War, American audiences may have just wanted escapist fare.  There was plenty of that, to be sure, but the best film of 1946 (both in the opinion of many critics and of voters of Academy) was a film that bravely grappled with the issues of the day.",1080432000,11,2876,5.137044967880086

TRANSFER: An absolute travesty.  Not only is the gray scale poorly rendered, with insufficient black levels and low contrast, but there is so much film grain and age related artifacts present to make this movie look three times its age.  Worse still, digital anomalies; aliasing, shimmering, edge enhancement, abound and are thoroughly distracting to say the least.  The audio - remixed by CHACE sound is amply presented, however, the documentary on the making of the film - previously available through HBO home video (though there too the transfer of the film was pure junk) is absent from this MGM re-release! What a mess, shame and sham!
BOTTOM LINE: This film will get a better transfer somewhere down the road. On this journey however, the wise DVD consumer would do best to steer clear!",1068595200,231,1260,5.043269230769231
155403,5,0792846133,"Every now and then a book or a movie appears that tells the story of a whole generation.  Some, like Hemingway's ""The Sun Also Rises"" and Hopper's ""Easy Rider"" tell the story of a segment of a generation.  However, ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" eloquently tells the story of Americans at the end of World War II.  The story is told through three returning veterans who come home together.  Before their flight takes off, one of them wanders through a ""graveyard"" of military planes.  The vastness of this airfield of defunct military equiptment brings home the message; the war's over and there's no further need for its' ""leftovers"".  The soldier can either move on or become another ""leftover"".  However, moving on is not all that easy to do.  Not after you've been through what these three men have been through.
Ironicly, the sailor, played by Harold Russell, laments that he didn't see any action.  The pilot and the soldier look at his two missing arms questioningly.  Russell was, himself, a returning disabled vet and he won a special Oscar for his inspiring preformance.  His role served as a reminder that it wasn't only the front-line troops that that came home with scars.
The three servicemen represent three different types of enlistees.  The men who entered the services right out of school, the ones who were called as they were starting out in the world on their own, and those who left behind an established career.  In turn, the ones they came home to represnted three different scenarios.  The young sailor comes home to his high school sweetheart.  She knows that this is not the boy who left her.  She is ready to love the man who returned in his place if she can figure out who he is.  The pilot came home to the woman he married just before he left for war.  He discovers that she had married a uniform and wasn't the least bit interested in what was inside it.  The third homecoming is to an established household of many years were there was still some uncertainty.
All three men found their perspectives radically changed by their absence and their experiences.  The ultimate question for each of them to answer was the meaning of the movie's title.  What were ""the best years of our lives""?  Were they they years of dedicated military service that they sacrificed for their country?  Or were they the lives they came home to.  The power of this movie is seeing them struggle with the question.  The way they they and the vast majority of US servicemen ultimately answered the question was what made America the greatest country in the world.",1067040000,5,2569,4.680803571428571

155405,3,0792846133,"I had long wanted to see this movie.  It's supposed to be one of the best ever.  However, all I could think of as I watched it was what how much better a modern version could be.
As a snapshot of America immediately after the end of World War II, it is valuable.  You see the hardships of the soldiers and sailors as they try to reassimilate themselves in civilian society.  You see characters deal with renewing ties with family they hadn't seen in years; you see a marriage fail; you see love triumph over tragedy.
You can also view the film as a historical document about film-making itself in 1946.  From the background music to the cadence of the actors' voices, this is what a great movie in 1946 sounded like.  From the smiling faces superimposed over neon night club signs to the deep, dark fades between scenes, this is what a great movie in 1946 looked like.  But that's the problem.  The movie is more enjoyable as a piece of American history than as an entertaining film.
One of my biggest complaints is about Harold Russell.  He plays a sailor returning home after having lost both hands in a fire.  The fact that Russell truly was a veteran who had lost both hands during the war brings life to the role.  His is the most interesting part of the story, because you feel this must have been exactly what it was like for Russell.  He is obviously a remarkable man, but he is a poor actor.  The movie wouldn't be the same without him, but it was difficult for me to overlook a bungled line or an awkward expression.  The academy did not find that so difficult, voting him an Oscar for supporting actor, as well as a special award for being an inspiration to others.  The second was well deserved.
The other actors in significant roles are fine.  They just have that mid-40s style.  It worked then, and works now if you have a taste for the nostalgic.
And I must say something about the final line of dialogue in the movie.  It is delivered by Dana Andrews.  It's something like, ""We'll get kicked around some.""  It seems like a very awkward line with which to end the film.  It feels as if he is in mid-thought, and the tone of his voice leads you to feel he is about to say something more.  But the movie ends there, like a great symphony that reaches a musical climax, then doesn't resolve the final chord properly.  We know what the final line of a movie should sound like, and this is not it.  The disonance of the line rang in my ears as the scene faded to the credits.
I do believe this is a movie that could be successfully remade.  The dialogue could be improved, be made more realistic.  It would not have to be the gritty, low-brow language that is all-too-common in today's movies, but it's obvious that the writers here were restricted by what was allowable in films almost 60 years ago.  I guess we'd end up with a 21st century interpretation of what returning from WWII was like.  But what we get here is 1946 Hollywood's version, which is surely just as distorted.
This is a movie worth seeing, but a story worth re-telling.",1047254400,9,3050,4.398214285714285
155406,5,0792846133,"""The Best Years of Our Lives"" is a compelling dramatic masterpiece, and certainly one of the best films ever made.  It's not as well known today as other pieces from the period, such as ""Casablanca"" or ""Citizen Kane"", but it is nevertheless a classic that deserves ranking with those same films.
This film paints a picture of the struggles of World War II servicemen that they faced AFTER the war was over.  It was a more personal struggle of men returning home after being away for many years, and after experiencing horrors that their loved ones could never fully understand.  They return home as changed people, and come home to changed lives.
The story of such a homecoming experienced by thousands of men after World War II is told from the perspective of three fictional characters: Captain Fred Derry, a bombadier in the Army Air Corps (Dana Andrews), Sergeant Al Stevenson, an Army infantryman (Frederich March), and Seamen Homer Parrish(Harold Russell).  They happen to meet on the plane to their hometown, having never met before, and immediately form a bond built upon mutual understanding of the experiences of war and the anxieties of returning home again.
Captain Derry came from a poor background before the war, and married a blond bombshell (Virgnia Mayo) while in the Air Corps.  He hopes to return home to a better life, a nice home with his wife, and a better job.  This was not to be, as Derry struggles to try and deal with bad job prospects (no one in the civilian world needs a bombadier) and a cheating wife.  In a poignant moment in the film, Derry (at his lowest) tells his Father to throw away the citations for his medals, because ""they don't mean anything"".  His Father reads the one for the Distinguished Flying Cross, signed by General Jimmy Doolittle, and a look of pride comes over the old man's face for his son's heroism that makes you want to cry and cheer all at the same time.  It also makes the viewer see how criminal it was for such a man to be made to feel worthless.
Sergeant Stevenson comes home to better circumstances, being a banker in the civilian world with a wife, two grown children, and a nice apartment.  But he too must confront troubles, as Stevenson must get to know a family that progressed without him, and balance his job with his desire to aid servicemen seeking G.I. Bill loans.  He battles with his bank's bosses over the loan issue, and also struggles with alcoholism.
Seamen Parrish's problems are the most obvious.  He lost his hands during the war, and now must come home to his family and fiancee with hooks for hands.  The actor who potrayed Parrish, Harold Russell, was a real disable veteran, and lends credibility to the role that no one else could have due to real life experience.
This may seem like a depressing film, but it is actually uplifting in its entirety because it does show that hope doesn't die, and that you really can come home again after all.  It is also a film of historical importance due to the insights it provides into post-World War II America, and the struggles of veterans in the post-war years.  Captain Derry, Sergeant Stevenson, and Seamen Parrish, and their individual struggles to reclaim their lives can provide the student of history an important perspective on the many real life veterans who returned home, and the country of the time they returned home to.
The film has certainly earned accolades over the years.  It won the Oscar for Best Picture of 1946. It was named by the American Film Institute as one of the 100 Best Movies ever made, and was also named as one of the most important films of all time by the National Archives for the National Film Registry.
""The Best Years of Our Lives"" is not to be missed for both its dramatic poignancy and its insight into an important period of American History.  And its a beautiful sight to behold in DVD quality.",1042934400,161,3869,4.649560117302053
155433,5,0792846133,"I have recently discovered Fredric March and have collected over 40 of his films. He was a wonderful actor, and I am amazed at how forgotten he has become. I mention his name to people, and they say ""Fredric who?"". This man was one of the greatest actors Hollywood ever had. Seeing  him in this film will only begin to tell the story. Yes, he won his 2nd Oscar for this performance; he won his first in 1932 for ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" (another great MUST SEE of Fredric's films). He should have won for his portrayal of Willie Loman in ""Death of a Salesman""... in 1951, but Bogart got it instead for ""African Queen"". Anyway, all the other reviews tell you what this movie is about. It is a very good story and all the actors and actresses do a great job. Fred is great in his drunk scene...he often had to play drunks in his films and he was always impressive. Myrna Loy plays his patient and oh so loving wife. She hasn't seen him in 4 yrs.at least, and he comes home, takes them out partying, and while dancing,after having more than a few too many, he says to her, ""You know, you remind me of my wife"". She calmly plays along, saying, ""You never told me you were married."" It is a sweet scene. I do not get that he was ever unfaithful to his wife. I felt he loved her deeply. Myrna just stood by him and loved him, she was a wonderful example to me of how to be a loving wife. I liked Theresa Wright as the daughter, and Dana Andrews was great too. Virginia Mayo played a woman you hope you will never be to a man, or hope that your daughter will never be...just selfish and out for fun and a good time. She was a very shallow person. You felt sorry for her. This film has the honor to be in the list of the top 100 films...it is truly a classic and a well told story. I love WW2 history and reading about the war, and so this film sits well with me for that reason too.

But it does a masterful job of revealing an astringent, non-glamorous, true-to-life series of postwar homecoming stories.  The characters are believable because they represent nearly all walks-of-life that exist in the real world: Fredric March's senior-most G.I. who's still in love with his wife of 20 years (Myrna Loy in a beautifully shaded performance), but barely knows his grown kids; the disabled sailor (Harold Russell), comfortable with his hand prosthetics but terrified of everyone treating him differently because of them; and Dana Andrews's bombadier, a hero overseas who comes back home to learn he can't find a job of any kind.

155435,4,0792846133,"The Best Years of our Lives is a very eye-opening film concerning the difficulties of World War II veterans in returning to the States after their tour of duty.  Three returning veterans meet on a flight to their ""small town"" (which seems rather large from the air as they approach).  However, one of the men (who had seved with the Navy) has lost his hands in the war, and now has what is constantly referred to as ""hooks;"" this is by far the most touching and interesting tale of the three interwoven threads in the film, yet relatively little time is afforded to this tale.
Each man returns to a family and a romantic interest.  The treatment of these issues, however, seems at odds with Hollywood fare and the Production Code system and the influence of the Legion of Decency (affiliated with the Catholic Church) of the time.  There is a very touching scene with the man with the ""hooks"" being undressed and helped into bed by his romantic interest in his bedroom (with his parents across the hallway) well before they are married.  The daughter of another returning military man falls in love with the third returning veteran even though the latter is already married; the film can be read as ambiguous at the end, but one can easily infer that they WILL get married soon (once an aforementioned divorce is finalized).
Various issues facing the return of veterans are brought to the foreground in this film.  Memories (rather, nightmares) of combat and the loss of comrades, lack of interest in the medals and commendations, handling naysayers, acquired interests in smoking and drinking (heavily), apprehension at seeing family and friends once more, and - especially - the lack of job possibilities are all quite prevalent throughout the film.
Except that this film is well over 2-1/2 hours in length, this is a good film overall.  The Scene Selection portion of the DVD is especially well-constructed, easily allowing users to find where to begin again if they cannot watch the entire film in just one sitting.

155438,5,0792846133,"The Best Years of Our Lives was released in 1946, just a short time after the end of World War II.  The men who served overseas in the war came home to a hero's welcome and seemed to have the world at their feet.  That rosy scene of hero worship faded and the men had to cope with coming back to the routine of normal life and the remembrances of the horror of war.  The Best Years of Our Lives examines how three men from a small Midwestern town deal with returning home from the war.  Frederic March is sterling as a husband and father of two who spirals down into melancholy and depression.  Dana Andrews is a dashing bombardier who at home is reduced to working as a soda jerk and whose wife parties all the time and lives beyond their means.  Harold Russell was a real veteran of war and first time actor.  Mr. Russell lost both of his hands in combat and he provides realism to his role that no actor could give as he actually went through the trials and tribulations he faced in the film.

155440,5,0792846133,"I have the HBO version of this film on DVD (now out of print), so I can't comment on the transfer quality of this MGM/UA disk, but I can comment on the quality of the movie.
My Amazon review will be number 48 for this film, yet it still retains an average 5-star rating! That's remarkable, but not surpirsing. Simply put, this film has been my favorite since the first time I saw it, about 20 years ago. It has aired almost too much in recent years due to cable TV channels like TCM, but before that it was hard to find, for some reason not clear to me, so the film was a mystery to me. However, I had seen it listed as the Academy Award winner as Best Film for 1946, so I was curious about it. Based on thumbnail reviews I had read, I had some notion of what it might be like, mostly because of my experiences with other B&W movies of the 1940s, but my expectations were dead wrong. This film is totally unique in its flavor and character, due in no small part to the talents and artistic vision of William Wyler, the great cast, the great story, and the timing of its theatrical release. Coming so quickly after the end of the War, the experiences of the characters on screen exactly duplicated the experiences of real Americans at that moment in our history. As another reviewer has speculated, it must have had an extremely powerful effect on the audiences of that day. It's still a memorable film-viewing experience now, 55 years later.
I won't get into the story line, because others have done that well enough. Actually, if you break the plot skeleton down into its elements it's probably not much different from other dramas of its type. What sets this movie miles apart is the very high quality of its production, and the way all of its elements merge together into a nearly perfect whole: First, the stirring music in the opening titles. Then the beautiful black and white photography, beginning with a lone soldier (Dana Andrews) looking already somewhat out of place in a bustling modern airport. The wonderful cross country ride in the nose of a B-17 as the three returning veterans get a bird's eye view of the land they fought to save (one of them losing his hands in the process). The taxi ride down Main Street in their home town -- the most compelling tidbit of nostalgia I've ever seen on film, and an honest peek into a bright, optimistic world that is long gone. Later, the difficulty in readjusting to civilian life, each of the three veterans with his own special problems.
For older viewers, this film is an almost overwhelming nostalgia trip. For younger viewers, it's an engaging drama and a truthful history lesson about who we as Americans are and where we've come from. I was a small child when this was made, but I can still remember the flavor of those post-War years. No, it wasn't a perfect world. In some ways it was very much like the one we live in now, but unless you were there, you can't imagine the impact that humongous war had on people's lives for at least a decade afterwards. ""The War,"" though in past tense, was involved in some way with almost everything you heard about. In fact, when Korea blew up in 1950, that conflict had a hard time being taken seriously because of the still very powerful lingering effects and memories of the recent ""big one.""
As I mentioned before, The Best Years of our Lives has only been readily available for viewing, either on TV or personal video, for the past ten or 15 years, and that's also true now of a lot of the great films (luckily for us!). This movie is an emotional one with an emotional appeal, so it's no surprise that it moves up and down in the ""top 100"" lists. A while back, in the early '90s, it was in the top five. Lately it's in the top 70 or so. The people who make these lists are fickle, and so the lists take you on a roller coaster ride over the years, but these things always seem to come full circle in due time.
I still remember, about ten years ago a top radio and TV talk show host announced that he had seen The Best Years of Our Lives the night before. In hushed, almost reverent tones he continued: ""It is absolutely the greatest film I have ever seen!""
What can I add to that? I absolutely agree!",999993600,7,4209,4.383631713554987
155441,5,0792846133,"It's amazing that a film can last 55 years after it's initial release and still be a memorable, sad, poignant, classic film that, unfortunately, is no longer made. There is absolutely no artistic integrity in our U.S. films! We have to look towards the foreign market in order to find art. But at least this film shows us that once upon a time we Americans had GREAT films.
THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES tells the story of three American veterans who return home after fighting overseas and discover that the home they once knew has changed without them. They all take the same plane home to Boone City (supposedly patterned after Cinncinnati) and go off into their own lives. Eventually, they all cross paths with each other.
Al Stephenson, played by the talented Fredric March (DR. JEKYLL & MR. HYDE), is an Army sergeant who finds that his job as a banker is unsatisfying. His wife Milly, played by Myrna Loy (THE THIN MAN), and their grown-up daughter Peggy, played by Teresa Wright (MRS. MINIVER, THE LITTLE FOXES) are surprised and thrilled by Al's return and a happy reunion begins. (There's also a son, Pat (Michael Hall), but he disappears after his first scene.) After a night of drinking and dancing, Milly and Peggy bring a drunken Al and Fred, played by regular tough-guy Dana Andrews (LAURA), back home. Eventually, Peggy falls in love with Fred, much to Al's disapproval later on. (A very tense scene between the two men.)
Then there's Fred's life. This segment shows him readjusting to life as a soda jerk, a job he swore he would never return to. There's Virginia Mayo as his unhappy, floozy wife, Marie; Roman Bohnen and Gladys George as Fred's parents Pat and Hortense Derry.
Finally, and perhaps the saddest, is Navy private Homer Parrish, played by real-life amputee and nonprofessional actor Harold Russell. In his segment, there's his uncle Butch Engle, played by jazz pianist Hoagy Carmichael; his parents; and his girlfriend Wilma Cameron, played by newcomer Cathy O'Donnell. There is, of course, the matter with his hooks, which he lost when they were burned off during the war. But Homer, apparently cheerful about the prospects of his new ""hands,"" goes on with his life despite his family and friends' horror at the things. (There is a touching scene, albeit a little scary, when Homer reveals his hooks to the kids by smashing the windows in his garage.)
Through it all they get threw their adversities one-by-one. Al finds happiness once again with Milly; Fred leaves Marie, who has been having an affair and wants a divorce, and goes to Peggy, despite Al's objections; and Homer marries Wilma, finally.
But the one scene that I thought was uncalled for was when Homer and another man get into an argument about the war and the reason for America's entry. I, for one, agree with the man! But his views obviously ticked Homer off and sends him into a rage, attacking the man for no reason. Then Fred jumps in and punches the guy in the face, sending him crashing into a display counter. I think that was unfair and uncalled for! However, Fred does lose his job, much to his delight!
But once again, this was an excellent film! An epic film that didn't show a single battle scene, only people with feelings and emotions. Now why can't we have films like that today? Well, don't worry, I'll fix that very soon.
This film was directed by the great William Wyler (MRS. MINIVER, BEN-HUR), and shot by cinematographer Gregg Toland (CITIZEN KANE). Written by Pulitzer Prize-winner Robert E. Sherwood, who also wrote the script for REBECCA; and produced by legendary producer Samuel Goldwyn. Distributed by RKO Radio.
Winner of 7 Academy Awards, in 1946, including: Best Picture - Sam Goldwyn, producer; Best Director - William Wyler; Best Actor - Fredric March; Best Supporting Actor - Harold Russell, who won another special Oscar for ""bringing hope to veterans""; Best Screenplay - Robert E. Sherwood; Best Film Editing - Daniel Mandell; and Best Score - Hugo Friedhofer. Nominated for 8, it only lost the Best Sound Recording Oscar for Gordon Sawyer. (Don't worry, though, the Academy named an award after him - not too shabby!)
At a length of almost 3 hours (170 minutes or 2 hours and 50 minutes to be exact), THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES proves that only family, friends, and their love IS the best thing in our lives.",998438400,3,4342,4.767596281540505
155442,5,0792846133,"Myrna Loy gives this reproof to her daughter Teresa Wright when Wright accuses Loy and dad Frederic March of having forgotten what it's like to fall in love. Loy and March have had a lot of adjusting to do just recently, with his having returned home from the war in the Pacific, and they're not the only ones facing that challenge. ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" concerns three servicemen, each from a different branch of service, each from a different socioeconomic level, each at a different time of life, who must make the difficult adjustment from wartime to peacetime. Frederic March was in the army. He's been married twenty years to his wife and is a well-to-do banker living in a luxury apartment building. His challenge is to re-enter his marriage and try to balance the needs of the bank with the needs of returning loan-seeking veterans. Dana Andrews was a star pilot in the airforce. He's from a shanty on the wrong side of the tracks,  and he got married after a whirlwind romance while on furlough. He's got to find a job outside the airforcce now, and deal with some bad combat memories while coping with his good-time girl of a wife, Virginia Mayo. The actor playing Homer was not a professional, but was chosen because, like the character he portrayed, he too had lost both his hands in an accident during the war. Like Andrews, he has to find a job, but he has the extra burden of being disabled complicating his long-standing engagement to the girl next door.  March and ""Homer"" have the best scenes in the movie, but for different reasons. March is a veteran actor playing a veteran of combat. He brings great depth to his role, beautifully giving us awkwardness and passion mixed together in his early scenes with Loy as they spend their first day morning together post war.  Homer has the scenes with emotional wallop: his homecoming, when his mother's hand flies to her mouth as she first sees his hooks as he waves goodbye to the other men in the cab; the solitude of his nights, when his father has to prepare him for bed; his vulnerability as he demonstrates to his fiancee what it would mean to marry a person with such disabilites. This is the price of war, even with victory. A fundamentally honest work, ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" details the anxiety of veterans at drift back on the homefront. It's a powerful movie which pays tribute to the men and the sacrifices they made.",997488000,6,2409,4.597674418604651
155443,5,0792846133,"The Best Years of Our Lives is amazing in its timeliness.  It is a wonder that such a movie, which intelligently handled the returning of three vets of World War II, could be made so soon after the end of the war, including pointed references to Hiroshima and a not so veiled stab at the anit-Communist hysteria growing in the country, and could be made so well that it goes beyond to timely into timeless.  The three returnees are Frederic March, Dana Andrews, and Harold Russell and they handle their chores very well indeed.  Myrna Loy is on hand to give another beautiful portrayal of an intelligent wife with a forgiving twinkle in her eye.  The film is almost three hours long and it handles this time with great skill.  A wonderful look at the effects on war on the home front after the fighting is over.",996796800,2,811,4.489795918367347
155444,5,0792846133,"This film is a true post-WWII classic.  The story follows three returning veterans from the war, and shows how they deal with life after military service.  Each story is touching in its own way.  Harold Russell, who actually lost both hands in the war, plays a disabled sailor.  He won two Academy Awards for this--a special award for inspiring disabled veterans and a Best Supporting Actor Oscar--to become the only performer in Academy history to win two Oscars for the same performance.  This film also features some of the best black and white cinematography I've ever seen.  The flight back into their hometown at the beginning of the film is just beautiful.",995241600,,663,4.875

155446,4,0792846133,A lot of people say this film plays like a Soap Opera but it really doesn't. It is just a honest look at what happens when some veterans returen from war. From the opening sequence we are all confronted with a sense of urgency and longing for how bad the men want to return to their normal lives! But their lives aren't normal Al Stephenson (Fredric March) realizes his kids have grown older and don't have the same bond with their father. Fred Derry (Dana Andrews) is trapped in a wreck of a marriage and Homer Parish (Harrold Parrish) was disfigured in the war and wonders if his family will accept him. This film is all about the human condition and the after effects of war. How can one rebuild ones life after being responsible for the death of others on the opposing side. How can you return to a life that you left behind when the world moves forward while the war seems to be standing still in your mind. This film never once goes for sap and every scene is raw and full of emotion and power! It is still relevant today due to the fact that the cruel mannerisms of war are still being felt and fought around the world. Films like this should be watched and discussed in great detail if everyone truly understands the after shocks of war then we wouldn't have a need for it.,992476800,4,1281,4.319502074688796

William Wylers Direction is flawless and he perfectly tells the story which has an everlasting effect on its viewers.
In summary: 3 veterans meet on their journey home from the war.  Al (March) an Army Sergeant, Fred (Andrews) was a bombardier Captain & Homer (Russell) a Navy Machinist Mate are exchanging war stories and enjoying themselves.  Finally reality begins to set in.  After 3 years away from home they now realize they must deal with home & Peace time.  Al is a Banker & a 20 year married man with 2 kids.  Fred is a newly wed who went away to the war  days after he was married.  Homer is returning home to his family & girlfriend, handless.

155450,5,0792846133,"It's been said that Homer's ""The Odyssey"" could just as easily be named ""The Homecoming.""  Wyler's film follows the homecoming experiences of not one but three veterans of the second World War.  As much as I love Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" I can have no regrets that virtually all of the academy awards for 1946 were given to Wyler's rather than Capra's film.  Nowhere has deep-focus photography (courtesy of Greg Toland) been employed more effectively in cinema and in no film is there a musical score as exhilarating yet complementary as that provided by Hugo Friedhofer.  Although the cinematography, editing, and music are in many respects the true stars of this masterwork, the acting certainly rises to the occasion, particularly the perfomances of Fredric March, Dana Andrews, and Teresa Wright.  And, of course, the casting of Harold Russell, an ordinary citizen-navyman who had lost both hands in the war, was and remains one of the most brilliant calls in Hollywood history.  Far from a period piece about WW II, the film remains a living treasure that should be required viewing for anyone interested in the power of cinema at its purest.",977443200,8,1155,4.989583333333333
155451,5,0792846133,"This outstanding 1946 film looks at WWII from a different perspective.  It examines the plight of soldiers returning after the war.  It follows three servicemen who meet on a flight back to their hometown.  The story is well crafted, depicting men from very different backgrounds, each from a different branch of the service and each with a different challenge to face.
Fred (Dana Andrews) was a bombardier, a dashing captain in the Air Corp.  He is coming home to a beautiful wife (Virginia Mayo) and no job prospects.  His wife loves to party, but his job as a soda jerk can't keep pace with her penchant for spending.  Al (Frederic March), a former banker, was a sergeant in the infantry with a wife of 20 years (Myrna Loy) and two grown children.  He comes home to a distant wife and a troubled marriage.  He is a banker with a heart, which evokes derisive scrutiny from his boss and the other bankers.  Homer (Harold Russell) was a sailor who lost his hands in a fire onboard ship.  He is returning to his parents and his long time girlfriend Wilma (Cathy O'Donnell) feeling certain that she will never be able to love him with his disability.
William Wyler (Wuthering Heights, Roman Holiday, Ben-Hur) is one of the most renowned directors in filmmaking history, having won four Oscars in twelve nominations.  His direction here is superb.  This is a compelling character study with nuance, sensitivity and insight.  The scenes of the uneasy moments of reunion were stirring, especially in the case of Homer, who was tormented and insecure about how he would be accepted without his hands.  Wyler takes us right into the most intimate thoughts and feelings of these families as they attempt to deal with challenges for which they are not totally prepared.  The scene where Wilma sees Homer without his prosthetics for the first time is one of the most touching and poignant ever filmed.
This is a candid look at the issues of the day.  The film addresses the burgeoning Communist threat and the sense of betrayal at the actions of our former Soviet allies after the war.  It refers frequently to the nuclear threat and the fear of mass destruction.  Most importantly, it shows how difficult it was for servicemen to adapt to a world that had become accustomed to getting along without them.
The acting was outstanding across the board.  Frederic March was excellent as the banker trying to hold together a troubled marriage.  He gave a towering performance and won an Oscar for best actor.  Andrews, who wasn't nominated (and should have been), also gave a fabulous performance as the glamorous flyboy who comes home to discover he has no skills and can't get a job.  Harold Russell won a best supporting Oscar for his portrayal of the sailor trying to regain his self-respect after the loss of his hands.  Russell actually lost his hands in the service in an explosives accident during a training exercise. He is amazingly dexterous using his prosthetics.  His portrayal of Homer had such affability, depth and sensitivity that it is difficult to believe this was his acting debut.
This film was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won seven including Best Picture, Best Actor for March, Best Director and Best Supporting Actor for Russell.  It is ranked number 37 on AFI's top 100 of the century.  I rated it a 10/10.  For anyone who enjoys a powerful and emotional character study, this classic is a must-see.",976492800,52,3420,4.791808873720137
155452,5,0792846133,"The story of three American veterans of WW II and their adjustments to civilian life remains as poignant and moving today, as when it was first released.  The three veterans (Fredric March, Harold Russell, and Dana Andrews) all from the same town, but different backgrounds, journey home together on a military transport plain.  Fredric March's character, Al Stephenson, is a mature married man with a good profession, a beautiful wife (Myrna Loy), and two grown children (Teresa Wright and Michael Hall); Harold Russell is a disabled Navy veteran (he lost both hands in battle) unsure of where he stands in life and with his high school sweetheart (Cathy O' Donnell); and Dana Andrews is the ""glamour boy"" bombardier who comes home to find that the civilian world, which includes his wife (Virginia Mayo), cares little about his exploits as a caption in the Air Force.  The journey each man takes is both engrossing and entertaining.  It's hard to believe this movie is almost 3 hours long; it moves along so quickly.  With a dream cast of top talent from 1940s Hollywood, director William Wyler gets superb performances from the stars as well as the most minor bit players.  The action begins with a night on the town with March, Loy, and Wright celebrating March's return home.  During their celebrating, they run into Russell and Andrews at Russell's uncle's (Hogey Carmichael) tavern. Having celebrated a bit too much, Loy and Wright load March and Andrews into their car to take them home.  They drop Andrews off at his wife's apartment building, but he doesn't have a key to get in, and in a drunken stupor collapses outside its entrance.  Loy and Wright proceed to load Andrews back in the car and take him in for the night.  The relationships between all the main characters reach a level of poignancy without being overly sentimental, which is no easy feat, especially with what must have been tough stuff to watch for an overwhelming majority of the audience when originally released.  Russell and O' Donnell's scenes are moving and sensitive, as are Loy and March's.  Even though Andrews arrives home physically intact, his lot seems to be the worst of the group.  Married to a self-centered-woman who doesn't love him, he longs for a relationship with someone like Peggy Stephenson (Wright).  Things get complicated when the feelings are mutual, with Wright beginning to have strong feelings for Andrews.  There are many wonderful moments in this film.  Roman Bohnen as Andrews's father is terrific as a man who has a tough time expressing his genuine love for his disillusioned son.  When he reads the official letter recounting his son's bravery to his wife (Gladys George), it's an incredibly powerful moment.  Another wonderful scene is Wright's visit to the store where Andrews works as a salesman at the perfume counter (as well as at the soda fountain).  The good-natured flirting between them seems both honest and real in the hands of these two pros.  One could go on and on about the wonderful score, the great Gregg Toland cinematography--from the opening shots from the transport plane to the aircraft ""graveyard,""--but this is one wonderful whole that is equal to the sum of its parts; everything falls together seamlessly.  Top talent at their peak; run don't walk to get a copy of this classic Best Picture winner (1946).",974246400,27,3349,4.934046345811051

I don't get to watch this movie often, but on the rare  occasions that I do, it never fails to move me and there is always  something new to catch my attention.  The entire cast is top-notch &  you can't take your eyes away from this film.  Frederic March, Dana  Andrews, Harold Russell, Myrna Loy & Teresa Wright are all outstanding  in their roles.  Teresa Wright also played a supporting role in another  William Wyler masterpiece-Mrs. Miniver.  They sure don't make 'em like this  anymore, folks-so please get this film & treasure it.  Very highly  recommended.",966470400,4,729,4.72
155454,5,0792846133,"Without trying to be sappy or use too many superlatives, this is a very special and moving movie. The premise is, of course, returning veterans after WWII, and their adjustment problems. Three veterans - each very  different - meet coming home and strike up a friendship - Fredrick March,  Dana Andrews, and Harold Russell (he actually lost his hands in the War and  he never acted before making this film!). Their ensuing difficulties in  melding back into their lives is poignant, moving, and very touching. With  extraordinary acting from a top notch Hollywood cast of the 40's (including  Myrna Loy and Theresa Wright - who is fabulous in her part) -  a terrific  script, and great direction, The Best Years... may in fact be one of  Hollywood's best of all time. I have seen this movie many times and never  grow tired of it. It still moves me to tears in parts, and touches me  deeply. I suppose that this film has some special meaning to me having  worked with veterans. I also find Dana Andrews' portrayal of what we now  refer to as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder to be very realistic, very  believable and extremely moving.

155455,5,0792846133,"** BLU-RAY UPDATE:  The November 2013 Blu-ray issue of this title is a MAJOR UPGRADE from the DVD re-issue from January 2013.  (See notes about that DVD below).  Dirt, scratches and other debris have been digitally removed and the film now looks and sounds (DTS-HD Master Audio 1.0) gorgeous.  The moment the opening credits roll, you know you're about to see the sharpest transfer of ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" ever released on home video.  Keep in mind, however, that there's still some graininess present - which is common with vintage movies given the Blu-ray treatment - and I do not consider this a defect.  While original negatives of old films never have the sharpness of movies shot today with high-resolution cameras, I'm not a fan of digital noise reduction - which removes details from each frame.  All special features from the January 2013 DVD re-issue are also on this Blu-ray, with subtitles available on everything except the theatrical trailer.  The 1995 interviews with Virginia Mayo and Teresa Wright were shot on video tape hence are NOT in high resolution - nor is the theatrical trailer, which is still ragged and has not been cleaned.  Still, in my view, the November 2013 Blu-ray is now the ""gold standard"" for this title.  Note also that this film is presented in its original 1:37:1 semi-square aspect ratio format.  Like ""Gone With the Wind,"" ""Casablanca"" and other Golden Age classics, ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" was NEVER shot with wide screen cameras.

** DVD UPDATE:  The January 2013 re-issue DVD offers NO improvement in picture or sound quality from previous DVD releases (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo).  Beyond cosmetic changes to the box - this edition brings back the 1995 interviews with Virginia Mayo and Teresa Wright that were on the 1997 HBO Video DVD release of this film - and improves the look of the English subtitles - which were all left off the MGM DVD release in 2000.  The January 2013 DVD release is a ""must"" ONLY if you want everything previously released - on one disc.  Remember, the 1997 HBO Video issue was a ""flipper"" - part 1 of the movie and special features were on side one, part 2 of the movie was on side two.  The 2000 MGM issue had NO English subtitles and NO special features other than an old trailer.  The January 2013 issue has the entire movie, subtitles and all the aforementioned special features on one side of the disc, with ""no flipping"" required.

===============================
ORIGINAL CONTENT REVIEW BELOW.
===============================

* Just before legendary director William Wyler died, equally legendary director Billy Wilder was interviewed about his feelings about Wyler's films, from ""Best Years of Our Lives"" to ""Roman Holiday"" to ""Ben Hur"" to ""Funny Girl.""

* Wilder, a tough man who hated schmaltz and sentiment, the director of such classics as ""Double Indemnity,"" ""Some Like it Hot,"" ""The Apartment,"" ""The Seven Year Itch"" and ""Sunset Boulevard,"" suddenly got emotional, expressing great affection for ""The Best Years of Our Lives,"" noting that it was one of the best films he had ever seen.

* He reacted the way I reacted. He said that it was the only film that he could remember where he and the entire audience were drenched in tears within the first 10 minutes. It was an unforgettable experience for him, and he recognized immediately that ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" was obviously a deeply personal work for Wyler, where every scene, every frame, every note of music and word of dialogue, rang true with authenticity and emotion. This was Wyler's territory. He knew the material. And many of the scenes that were shot mirrored his own experiences when he returned home from war.

* This is why, after so many viewings, I still can't get over the fact that no matter how many times I say to myself, ""I'm not going to be moved by this or that scene,"" I fail miserably. I just can't help it. To say that this is a great film is an understatement of the highest order. And yet I can only count on one hand the number of friends I know who have seen this film from start to finish. I think the running length has something to do with it. You never see it on commercial television at all and unless you're lucky enough to have cable, you'll miss it entirely. And it's not a film that people are banging down the doors to rent.

* The wonderful thing about ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" is that it still holds up beautifully, unlike a lot of films that seem awkward or stilted. Fredric March, as the patriarch of the family (in an Oscar winning role), is stupendous. His acting and delivery of lines seems effortless and spontaneous, not the product of a script recited from memory. And to have Myrna Loy as his partner and the wonderful Teresa Wright playing his daughter (the latter an Oscar winner a few years earlier in ""Mrs. Miniver""), how can you lose?

* Like all great films, time has no meaning. The story sweeps you along like a great wave -- a ride -- that you never want to end. The famous ""long hallway homecoming shot"" that appears in the first 10 minutes of the film -- I don't care that it's the scene that most people remember and is usually the ONLY scene that turns up in any highlight reel of greatest films ever made -- it gets me every time.

* And the ending, the last line from the movie, the one uttered by Dana Andrews -- despite the sentimental setting -- is so fabulously understated, negative and cynical - and yet filled with such hope, that you can't help but be -- what I describe as being -- ""happily devastated."" It's a wonderful ending that purposely leaves you guessing about what will become of the characters played by Teresa Wright and Dana Andrews, but you can't help but feel that their future looks bright in spite of their apparent state of destitution.

* I just wish more people would see this film. There's a treasure chest of great movies from the past that people overlook every day. This is one of them. I pity people who still buy or rent movies based on slick packaging alone.

* I would rather pay $10 to see this film on the big screen or less than $20 to own this film so I can see it on a little screen -- than pay about $4 to rent junk that has a good looking box -- and a few great critical reviews from people you've never heard of.

* Some films are good enough to rent, but only a few films are good enough to buy. ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" is a film to BUY.",963964800,438,6423,4.556038227628149
155456,5,0792846133,"As the USA let out a sigh of relief with the end of WWII in Europe and in the Pacific, it was time to start putting the everyday American's life back together.  With the end of the war came demobilization, and millions of  discharged soldiers headed home.  That is what this movie is all about.  Coming home.
The home they came home to was basically unchanged.  The  problem, though, was that they had changed.
This movie tells the story  of three men -- an infantry sergeant, an air corps officer/bombardier, and  a sailor -- all returning to the same home town someplace in the  midwest.
The sergeant returns to his family, his children grew up while  father was away, and he works to fit back into the work-a-day world at the  bank where he was an exec before the war.
The air corps officer, we soon  learn is someone from ""the other side of the tracks."" He returns  to his wife who, apparently, loves his uniform and partying more than she  loves him.  Things are rough.  He also finds that while he left his former  assistant is now his superior.
The sailor is crippled, having lost both  hands in a ship-board fire.  He is working on rehabilitation, but finds  that his girl, who has been waiting while he was away, is still waiting.  Therein lies his problem.  One that many servicemen faced -- making their  way while dealing with a disability resulting from military action, and  coming to grips with the transition back to civilian life.
This movie  tugs on the heart strings of America.  It paints a picture faced by many a  returning serviceman: challenges in civilian life, finding work, rekindling  close relationships with family, and dealing with the occasional  inappreciative civilian.
While I am not of the generation that served  during WWII, I'd like to say THANKS to all those who answered the call to  serve (during WWII and in all other conflicts where American military was  involved), to protect the rights and freedom that too many of us so often  take for granted.  Thank you for your sacrifice, for your lives.
Watch  this movie, it is one of the best movies ever made.

155457,5,0792846133,I bought this movie based on reviews - something I rarely do.  I couldn't remember ever seeing it before and still don't.  How this fantastic movie ever escaped me I don't know.  A great cast in telling an outstanding  story.  Every Academy award won was well deserved and probably should have  wone more.  Excellant DVD.,958003200,,321,4.7272727272727275
155458,5,0792846133,"""Best Years of our Lives"" was made in 1946, and is an excellent film about three returning veterans. One lost his hands during a naval battle, another had a distinguished war record but no job skills, the  third, played by Fredric March, was thoroughly changed by the war, but  immediately went back to his former life. The script did not soft-pedal  anything. By respecting the traumas involved, it also brought out the  honor, faithfulness, and dignity of the principal characters. It captured  my heart and didn't let go until the credits started rolling.",957139200,,558,4.956989247311828
155459,5,0792846133,"Considering the impact that The Best Years of Our Lives retains today, I can only imagine the powerful impact the film must have had on audiences when it was released just after the war.  It's a very honest look at the  difficulties and adjustments facing both soldiers and their loved ones when  they return home after experiencing the horrors of war and death.  The  movie looks at three soldiers dealing with different aspects of the  re-adjustment.  Fredric March must reconnect with his wife and job, and  finds comfort with the bottle.  Dana Andrews must find a job and get to  know the girl he married quickly before going off to war, a girl that was  more in love with his uniform than the man in it.  Harold Russell must  learn to adjust to civilian life and his fiancee without his arms, having  lost them during the war.  There are too many great scenes to recount.  The  performances are incredible.  Myrna Loy is at her best as March's patient  wife.  Teresa Wright, one of the best and most reliable of the actresses of  the Forties is excellent as Loy and March's daughter who falls in love with  Andrews.  Dana Andrews gives his greatest performance,  and Harold Russell  is unforgettable as the soldier with the biggest obstacle to overcome.  William Wyler scores again with another mature, expertly acted,  dramatically charged film that reminds us about the power of moviemaking.",950313600,16,1398,4.789029535864979
155460,5,0792846133,"Okay, so you've seen ""Saving Private Ryan,"" now it's time to see the film that should follow it. Light years ahead of such similiar films as ""Coming Home,"" and ""The Deerhunter,""  this is the film  that took the acadamy award for best picture away from ""It's A  Wonderful Life,"" and would still do so today. An incredable cast gives  the performances of their lives, fully depicing the feelings and problems  faced by America's returning WWII veterans. Watch this, along with  ""Twelve O'Clock High,"" ""The Longest Day,"" ""Das  Boot,"" ""Saving Private Ryan,"" and ""Schindler's  List,"" and you've seen the best depictions of WWII that cinema has yet  produced. If you have time throw in the BBC miniseries ""Piece of  Cake,"" if you can find it. And bring a some keenex.",950227200,,761,4.829457364341085
