But if you watch this worthless piece of junk, you will regret the time you wasted on it.
As a Prime member, watched it for free.
I really wished I'd done something else, but I did a lot of fast forwarding.
Some decent names in the cast, Tanya Raymonde, Lili Simmons, no clue why they made this.",1529971200,,361,4.323529411764706
8755190,3,B01D9AA4EY,"Life is tough. I hope you recognize this and if you don't then you might want to get out in the real world more, but anyways. In terms of this particular film, I thought the premise was great though the overall production with regards to the storyline was rather disjointed. Why do I say this? Well, I think it was missing part of the backstory to the film that explained a lot of the cast's characters' actions. Would you agree? The only way you'll is if you decide to watch this film, but there are many better choices you can select than this one. I'd understand if you skip this one entirely.",1499385600,,596,4.330357142857143

8755195,2,B01D9AA4EY,"Josh (Mark L. Young) is a Hollywood go-fer  for a rich movie  maker and his wife. He disobeys his boss and picks up her birthday present necklace early and hides it for the weekend at his shared home while a party is going on and the owner has financial problems.  Not too hard to predict as the film digresses into the home break-in  genre including the turn around and ending twist.

If you haven't seen Kidman in ""Trespass"" I would say watch it instead.  The plot was tedious.  I liked Katrina Begin when she watches herself on the screen and realizes she sucks as an actress.

Guide: Swearing. Near brief sex. No nudity.",1458604800,,624,4.460176991150442
