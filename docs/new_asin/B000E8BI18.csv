2508866,5,B000E8BI18,"This is by far one of the best videos in our house right now.  My two boys, age 1.5. and 4 both enjoy watching it as does my husband!  The songs are catchy and well done.  I'm assuming if you're reading this, you're already well aware of the benefits of teaching hearing children ASL, but I can't say enough positive things about it.

We started signing with our first son when he was one (without these videos) and around 15 months he ""got it"" and starting picking up signs everyday.  Eventually he could do about 50 signs and recognized others as well.  It DEFINITELY reduces or eliminates the frustration many toddlers feel when they can't communicate their wants and needs to you.  We never experienced that as he would just sign whatever was on his mind.

We did the same with our second son but also bought a few of these Signing Times videos.  He's 18 months and already knows well over 50 signs.  He'll pick them up just watching the video!  They are so much fun to watch and both kids are mesmerized watching the other kids sign.  The animation is well done, songs are fantastic, clips of each animal are enjoyable and the entire concept is wonderful!

This particular video (zoo train) is better than our other one (Great Outdoors), mostly in terms of songs and ""games"" (guess what animal I am).  The game is my older son's favorite part.  I've taken two ASL courses and even learned new signs here!  Definitely recommend this video whole heartedly!",1167955200,,1459,4.575289575289576
2508867,5,B000E8BI18,"We were introduced by our son's child care giver. He was 20 months old when he first started with signing time in Daycare. Ever since then he came home signing and singing the melody of the songs from the DVDs. When he started to speak all the alphabets and numbers and words from the books, me and my husband were surprised and happy. When he was two years old, he already knew all the colors, number 1-10 and A to Z in additon to a lot of vocabs. Until today, he watches signing time everyday and continue learning.

We think this is a great fun learning product and we love it!",1163030400,,580,4.225225225225225
2508868,5,B000E8BI18,Our school is currently using Signing Time in an after school program to introduce and teach American Sign Language to children ranging in grades K-6. Rachel does a good job of desribing and demonstating the signs. The music and songs create an enjoyable way to reinforce the new signs learned.,1155686400,,294,4.9
2508869,5,B000E8BI18,"As the mother of twins, one hearing and one deaf, I have had the opportunity to check out many programs for teaching ASL to small children.  This is by far the best series out there.  Most other products are so boring that parents must struggle to stay awake during the production, and there is no way a toddler would tolerate a viewing.  My 2-year-old twins request Signing Time all of the time.  At home they want the DVDs playing almost constantly.  In the car my hearing daughter starts asking for the Signing Time CD before I even have her strapped into her carseat.  My 2-year-old deaf daughter is using 5-sign sentences, which is almost unheard of for the deaf child of hearing parents.  My extended family owns a total of 6 sets of Signing Time.  Whenever my daughters' cousins have a birthday they ask for the latest Signing Time DVDs.  Children of all ages love this product.",1148860800,8,885,4.585987261146497
2508870,5,B000E8BI18,"My 13 month old has learned almost all the animal signs and can do them from watching this video. I took ASL in college but forgot A LOT and never learned some animal signs. It's a great refresher for me too! This was the first ""Signing Time"" video we bought. Our son has a few other baby sign videos that covered the basics ""mama"", ""dada"", ""dog"", ""cup"" etc. This was nice as most on the market cover the same 20-30 basic beginner baby signs. I like the format and songs. Keeps baby's attention and unlike some videos (i.e. the baby einstein style) where they sign ""dog"" and then show 4 different types of dog toys- it doesn't feel like one long commercial for the BRIO toy coorporation. We'd had a mother's helper that is a homeschooled teenager who is taking ASL at a community college. She likes it too- and it helped her review for her class.",1146787200,2,846,4.3949044585987265
2508871,5,B000E8BI18,"Two Little Hands has done it again!  Instant approval from my 20 month old, 3- & 5- year-old.  We go to the zoo often so they were excited to learn the signs for more of their favorite animals.  The animation is enjoyable. The songs, as with all Signing Time volumes, are fantastic.  A must have in your collection!!",1140566400,,316,4.396551724137931

2508874,5,B000E8BI18,Got this for my grandkids 3 and 1.  Since they love the zoo they loved this.,1419379200,,76,3.75
2508875,5,B000E8BI18,This is a great video for teaching sign language or for language development / concept development.  We used this video for a month before our zoo field trip.  We had a student who was scared to go to the zoo (mom said she would have huge meltdowns there so their family couldn't go together to the zoo) but she did fine on the field trip after the first 15 minutes of being there.  She discovered for herself that she liked the zoo.  (We also used a social story I made using actual pictures from our zoo.),1413590400,,507,4.25
2508876,5,B000E8BI18,I love all the Signing Time! videos! Each one teaches something new to both myself and my non-verbal child. The songs are catchy and fun for little ones and the way Rachel converses with the audience is refreshing. She makes you feel like having a hearing loss or not being able to speak isn't a deficit. This particular Signing Time! is about animals that you would see at the zoo or in the wild. It's nice to be able to go to the actual zoo and be able to have my son tell me the animals and see his excitement from understanding what he is seeing.,1403049600,,550,4.19811320754717
2508877,5,B000E8BI18,"These DVDs are great!

This one does a great job teaching animal signs that aren't covered on other videos, from zoo animals to animals you'd see in an aquarium.

Includes catchy songs, and song-only replay and sign review options. Plus the ASL alphabet at the end.

Haven't met a SigningTime/BabySigningTime Video I wouldn't recommend!",1394150400,,336,5.185185185185185

2508879,5,B000E8BI18,We have several of the signing time DVDs and this one is on par with the others.  My 2 year old granddaughter loves this series and has already learned most of the signs. Would recommend for everyone,1388620800,,199,4.378378378378378
2508880,5,B000E8BI18,"Our son loves animals, so this was the perfect DVD for him. We started him with signing time at 8 months old and by 1 he had over 100 signs. At 2 1/2 he still enjoys this dvd and Leahs Farm.",1386115200,,190,3.658536585365854

2508884,5,B000E8BI18,"I bought this and other Signing Time DVDs to use help me become more fluent in ASL.  The DVDs are meant for children, but they help me by providing lots of practice, buy limiting the topic, by using and instructing a vocabulary that is content specific.  I am enjoying using these to improve my skills.",1331424000,,302,4.472727272727273
2508885,5,B000E8BI18,"My daughter started to watch these collections fter she turned one.  She definitely preferred this over Lyour baby can read"".

2508886,5,B000E8BI18,My kids love this. We actually got it initially at the library and my twins (33 months) didn't want to take it back. They know many of the signs when we go to the zoo or the aquarium. It has cute songs and is very educational. I want to look into buying some of their other DVDs.,1327881600,,279,3.912280701754386
2508887,5,B000E8BI18,"My 18-month old whizzed through the Baby Signing Time DVDs between 8 and 10 months.  We then started purchasing other Signing Time videos to keep her learning.  She uses signs for almost everything, but also says the words now too.  It's helpful that everyone uses signs as our 6-month old starts learning too.  I love how Signing Time has made our lives so easy and enjoyable. Seriously, no fussing b/c she can communicate.  She had cleft palate surgery at 12-months old and was able to tell us when and where she hurt.  Beautiful tool that I think every child should have.

2508889,4,B000E8BI18,"We go to the zoo a ton, so I thought this would be a fun one to add to our Signing Time library.  I don't like the songs as well as some of the others we have, but my girls love it and seeing my 18 month old sign penguin while watching the penguins - priceless.

2508891,5,B000E8BI18,"Our kids love Signing Time, and we as parents love that they enjoy educational programming that teaches them to communicate with us.  Signing Time has made a huge impact on our ability to communicate with our 1-year-old girl and 2-year-old boy, and this really helps to keep tantrums to a minimum since we can understand each other.  Volume 9 of Signing Time is great like all of the others!",1275868800,,391,4.6521739130434785
2508902,5,B000E8BI18,This movie was wonderful.  My 1 1/2 year old loves to sign and would rather watch the videos than cartoons.  These movies are full of songs and even my 5 year old nephews love to come over and watch them.,1229385600,,204,4.075

2508906,5,B000E8BI18,This is a great pre-zoo video for all children. I use it with my speech & development delayed son and he loves it! It is a great way for him to tell us what he saw in real life or books.,1216598400,,186,3.5609756097560976
2508907,5,B000E8BI18,"I love these videos and will own all of them.  The only down fall is they don't have more to the series.  My child has speech delay and can only verbal say 10 words at the age of 3.  He's been in speech for over three months with little improvement.  We started to buy Signing time series and he can now sign over 100 words.  This has helped the communication between us.  At one point he was banging his head in frustration because he couldn't relay want he wanted, felt or needed.  Since these videos he has stopped.  He loves these videos, he also and signs ""signing time movie please"".  My child also picks up new signs within minutes and is proud to teach me them!",1206835200,,669,4.246031746031746
