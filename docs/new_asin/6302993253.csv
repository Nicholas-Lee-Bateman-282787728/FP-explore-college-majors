8273447,5,6302993253,"I love the original SUBSTITUTE pictures with Tom Berenger and even all the lousy sequels.  So I was prepared to pout when this one popped on my TV, thinking, I wonder if they are now going to have a female version of Tom Berenger?  But no, this movie is cut from different cloth.  It's still great.  Watching it you feel like you've stumbled into some sort of previously unknown Brian De Palma movie.  And Amanda Donohue, who never really impressed m,e before, save in her fearlessness in taking off her clothes for Ken Russell movies, is really wonderful in the part of Gayle Richardson, an ordinary school teacher in Albany (upstate New York) whose life goes topsy-turvy on her 10th wedding anniversary, when she discovers a strip of film in the breast pocket of her husband's blue sports jacket.  Four photo booth pictures of one of Gayle's own students!  This leads poor Gayle to a mental collapse, accompanied by ominous thudding music, while she sits in a bus station trying to figure out her next move.

For action fans, and students of film, watch carefully the scene where she burns down her own house after having used a stun gun on cheating husband and slutty student.  The production saves money on not having to shoot footage of a house burning but just showing flames reflected in the windshield of Gayle's car where she sits gloating at the two deaths inside the house.  The range of emotions on Amanda Donohoe's face is amazing.  She's like Joan Crawford crossed with Jeanne Moreau.  This whole sequence might well have been the climax of a run of the mill picture, but here it's the very first thing that happend!  Director Martin Donovan, who helmed the stylish thriller APARTMENT ZERO, knows how to make your flesh crawl on the smallest of budgets.  He doesn't ""cheat the camera,"" although I was disappointed that there wasn't more sex in the movie.  Certainly he rounded up some good looking actors to play out the roles; maybe the film was originally made for TV and that's why we don't see as much of Ms. Donohoe as we're used to.

There's also Dalton James from PASSIONS and BEVERLY HILLS 90210.  He has that Christopher Reeve thing going on where he's so good looking he doesn't seem real, but Donovan even manages to make Mr. James show some emotion.

What happens is that Gayle disappears from the fire tragedy and reappears under a pseudonym in a new town in Minnesota and gets a job as the substitute to a troubled high school class.  The movie goes in two directions in this point.  In the first, we see her descend deeper into madness and kill more people.  In the second, we see her doing a variation of TO SIR WITH LOVE, actually helping these teens and making their lives better, in a montage sequence that has to be seen to be believed.  If you remember DANGEROUS MINDS with Michelle Pfeiffer in the ghetto classroom, well imagine the same movie with Michelle Pfeiffer also being a psycho killer as well as an inspiration to youth?  Well that will give you a key into the schizophrenic charm of THE SUBSTITUTE.  Obviously filmed in Canada, masquerading as the USA yet again, this low budget sleeper features early appearances by Molly Parker, Natasha Gregson Wagner, and Mark Wahlberg, here billed as ""Marky Mark"" and acting so terribly it's amazing he ever got another job after this.

I see that Holly Hunter won the Oscar in 1993, but I'm here to tell you, it should have been Amanda Donohoe.",1129680000,4,3429,4.656146179401993
