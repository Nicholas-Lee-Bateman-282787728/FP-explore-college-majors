8130881,5,B000GE528K,"This 2005 Missouri recap gives us an excellent summary of the Tigers'great come-from-behind victory over South Carolina and Steve Spurrier, who badmouthed Missouri when the Tigers beat Florida when Spurrier was its quarterback.  Besides showing Brad Smith at his best, this video gives us a glimpse of Chase Daniel, Martin Rucker, Tony Temple,and other standouts of the 2007-8 season. The color is vivid and the action excellent, featuring some of Mizzou's highlights, while glossing over some of the lapses. This is a must for any Mizzou fan's library.",1216857600,,553,5.284090909090909
