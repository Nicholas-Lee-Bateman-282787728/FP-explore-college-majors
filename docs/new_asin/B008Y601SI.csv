8532403,5,B008Y601SI,This is one super tough workout by the firm which I really love. This video tones your whole body in minimum time and Traci Long is a great motivator. This program can easily be modified to suit beginner as well as advanced exercisers. It's a complete weight workout with no cardio and very low impact. I highly recommend this tape.,1446336000,4,332,4.55

Received the product quickly, and would purchase from this seller again.",1368316800,5,290,4.918367346938775
