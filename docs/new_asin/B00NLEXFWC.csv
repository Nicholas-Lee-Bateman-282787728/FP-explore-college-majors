The movie starts by showing how a lifer convict can be pardoned to allow him to continue crime in another state, but provides no other details. [This must be a reference to that bribery scandal in the Illinois prison system.] It is part of a plan designed by a master criminal who has connections in that state. The plan is to knockover a resort hotel for the rich during the season; they have an inside man who will tip them off.

The gang is staying at a rural resort before the crime. A small dog enters the cabin and is adopted as a pet. But all of its previous owners died in accidents - symbolism for this story! Ida Lupino's acting reflects her star billing. There is a side story where Roy Earle helps a migrating family he met on the road. He donates a large sum of money for an operation for their granddaughter. To show there's some good in even the worst? But once the operation succeeds, her personality changes from humility to pride! This seems like a cynical view of the common people. Is it realistic?

The other operation goes as planned, but an unforeseen event occurs to botch the operation. As in other stories, the real problem results when trying to split the loot. When the master criminal dies, he is replaced by another. A wrinkle develops when a criminal gets greedy, but is soon ironed out by the usual means. The movie says the old individual gangs are dying out. (They were being replaced by nationally organized crime.) Just like small owner-operated businesses were losing out to corporate chains?

This was Humphrey Bogart's last movie as a villain. After ""The Maltese Falcon"" he played heroes, and received top billing. This movie shows the economic direction of John Huston, which is repeated in ""The Maltese Falcon"". Watch them in historical order. I think HS is a better story and movie than TMF, which seems like a parody of the original 1931 version, a better story. The character of Ray Earle is based on John Dillinger.",1432080000,,1984,4.611898016997167
