8206440,4,B000SQLBV8,"This is the edited version of the Tournado DVD. It is perfect for fans of the Rejects that are young. All of the language and, oddly enough, nudity is removed. It is REALLY funny (you wouldn't believe some of the idiotic things they do) and has tons of music from them in it.  Definite purchase for young AAR fans!!!!
