I believe yoga will help with all kinds of aches and pains that we get as we get older.  Thank you Bob for a great video!  I highly recommend it.
My husband is waiting for me to be able to make that pose Bob has on the picture of the dvd cover.",1429574400,,390,4.025974025974026
8070981,5,B000A0C6Z2,"I love it. This is a great yoga DVD for a few good reasons. The routine is easy to follow. There are only a couple positions that are challenging, but this is the strength of the routine in my opinion. Perfect for beginners, for those getting up there in years, and the stiff couch potato. I like to use it the day after a more demanding martial arts stretching routine when I am a little stiff and before bedtime. It helps me sleep better. Especially if you are one of those people out there that does no exercise or next to nothing and sit around all day in front of a computer or the likes and really don't get into exercising. Get this video. It will be great for your body with little demand on your schedule. Once you do it once, on the following sessions, you will feel like it was over in no time flat.",1302134400,2,810,4.165605095541402
8070982,5,B000A0C6Z2,"This has a mixture of static stretches, moving (gently) stretches, and some joint mobility. It has a lot of variety between these and the stretches are held for various amounts of time; some short & some up to 20 seconds. The poses are what are in most stretching videos, however, for most of them, Bob does them in a unique way so it is very refreshing and interesting.

There are two main sections. The first is 40 minutes of stretching & moblity and the second section is 12 minutes of stretching, mobility, & massage using a playground-type of ball. I used my Fluidity ball & it worked fine (although you lay down on supine on the ball so the ball has to be sturdy enough to support your weight).

This is almost a full body stretch routine - no stretching for hands & feet, and more emphasis on lower body and back with some on neck, shoulders, and sides.

I was hesitant to try this because the video description mentions kneeling postures in particular and I don't like sitting on my knees; in actuality, there is not much kneeling at all.

Bob mirror cues for a lot of the video, however, there is at least one exercise where he doesn't. He speaks calmly & his cueing is okay to very good. I even liked the music - it is a variety of light music tracks such as instrumental flute music that is unobtrusive and pleasant. The setting is a nice, green garden.

This is one of the best stretching routines I have done. I have many, many stretch and yoga videos and, for stretching, this is in my top 4 favorites and I would rank it in my top 2 for putting new twists on the same old stretch postures.

Update 8/11: another great video with moving stretches is Janet Stone's Ganesha Flow...much more intense than Chinese Yoga and now one of my favorites.",1257206400,3,1757,4.407407407407407
8070983,5,B000A0C6Z2,"I purchased this dvd on a whim and I'm very glad I did.  If you want a dvd with slick production values, this may not be for you.  While the quality is high, it has a home-made feel.  But I think that is part of it's charm.

This is a good program for beginners or those who need a therapeutic or gentle yoga practice.  No yoga experience is needed. Klein demonstrates the poses with voice-over instruction.  Some poses are held, but there is an overall emphasis on moving and loosening the joints and muscles. There are a few standing postures but most of the program is done on the floor (which I personally like).  So far I have skipped the sequence with the ball (you can chapter through it) and without it, the program is approximately 40 minutes long.

I will look to this dvd for those times when I feel like I need to loosen up and get the kinks out.",1226793600,2,858,4.253086419753086
8070984,5,B000A0C6Z2,"I am glad I decided to try this DVD because it turned out to be a good therapeutic session, for me. You need to have some flexibility or the mindfulness to modify to do this. I would definately recommend this DVD.",1173657600,,213,4.219512195121951
8070985,5,B000A0C6Z2,"This DVD includes standing, kneeling, sitting and reclining postures.  With many Yoga programs you hold positions and there is no movement in between.  With this DVD you may hold a posture and then move part of the body out of the posture and back in, while the rest of the body retains the posture.  This stretches deeper muscles of the body and increases awareness of those finer muscles.  There is also a section at the end using a Yoga ball which seems to emphasize relaxing the back.  Some postures will be familiar to Yoga practitioners but there are many unique to this system.

The video quality and presentation is clear and easy to follow.",1147824000,5,649,4.649122807017544
