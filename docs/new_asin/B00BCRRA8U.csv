5579453,5,B00BCRRA8U,first off before i say anything else. GRAB A COPY FAST!! an item like this will not be staying around for long. if its original company hasn't made a dvd set until now. that means they never cared to do so and will probably want this down if it doesn't sell as much as they want it to. just as it says on top its SUPER RARE do you know how long its been since i seen season 3 and 4 in high quality. i can finally watch my favorite episodes without hurting my eyes with very bad youtube copies. now this is a cartoon i wouldn't mind putting on everyday sometimes i get annoyed with some cartoons watching the same episodes over and over but beetlejuice was rare to be put on cartoon because its movie wasn't that popular not as much as ghostbusters or back to the future of the same era. now this is proof that the beetlejuice character is bigger then the movie ever was.  YESSSS!!!!!,1361318400,3,883,4.194117647058824
5579454,5,B00BCRRA8U,"I am so excited to finally see a DVD release for the Beetlejuice cartoon.. It brings me back to a day when Saturday mornings were all about the cartoons.. Now even though i am an adult i wish my kids could have that excitement rather than waking up to a bunch of infomercials.. Also internet and such things as YouTube and Netflix make cartoons much more accessible to watch than the days before things like DVR's .. One of my all time favorites the cartoon made in my opinion Beetlejuice a family film..The cartoon was so perfect..funny, not too scary for little ones, and i thought always tried to throw in a little message for kids.. If there is one thing negative...and i mean it's a small complaint.. is the price of this set.. $70 is pretty steep..I would like to see some individual releases to test my kids likes(they like shows like Regular Show, Adventure Time, Spongebob..things like that)I will pick up this set and hope that i'm not sitting watching it by myself!

5579455,5,B00BCRRA8U,"I used to watch this show when I was a kid (back when the show originally aired) and loved it.  I still love the show and have been waiting for it to come out on DVD for literally years now.  Shout! Factory, who brought us some amazing TV on DVD releases such as All in the Family: The Complete Series, the post Rhino Video Mystery Science Theatre 3000 volumes and the various SCTV sets, is going to be releasing this title in May and I couldn't be happier.  This is a very funny series -- corny at times, yes -- but that just adds to the fun.  For those of you who have seen the series before, you know how good it is already, but for those of you who never saw it, check out some episodes on You Tube first and see what you think of it.  As for me, I wish I didn't have to wait till May to get it.  I wish I could just say ""Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice!"" and it would just magically appear -- delivered straight from the Netherworld, but I guess I will just have to wait for the official DVD release like everyone else.

On top of this complete series set there will also be a season one set of this series being released on the same date, but I am going to get the complete series.  I ran into a problem with Time Life a while back when I started collecting individual volumes of The Real Ghostbusters on DVD.  I managed to get the first three out of the five volumes of the series individually, but Time Life pulled the rug out from under me by not releasing the last two volumes separately.  I ended up having to buy the complete series and sell off the other three volumes.  I realize, of course, that Time Life and Shout! Factory are two separate companies, but If the complete series and season one are both coming out at the same time, I am definitely getting the complete series.  I'm not saying that Shout! Factory will pull the rug out from under those who choose to buy the seasons individually, but after what Time Life did, I am not leaving myself open to such a dirty underhanded trick again.  I'm not sure about anyway else, but unless there are official release dates for the other seasons of the series before the end of May, I am sticking to getting the complete series.",1360713600,15,2199,4.244604316546763
5579456,5,B00BCRRA8U,"Thank you Shout Factory! you guys have come through again with releasing one of my favorite cartoons shows from my childhood, Beetlejuice. I love this show and I'm glad that its a complete series release which means no waiting for season/volumes releases or stalled releases because of poor sales. I wish that older shows would just be released in complete series sets and then release complete seasons that way all the episodes can be released.",1360540800,49,445,4.946666666666666

5579468,5,B00BCRRA8U,I'm very trilled that all of the episodes are available on one set! This was one of the best cartoons I grew up watching & still is today! I used to watch reruns a lot back in the 90's when it aired on Nickelodeon! Good times! This set is currently one of the best bang for the buck deals. 94 great episodes for only $25. I remember when it cost that much or more for just one season of a tv show back in the early-mid 2000's. I've watched the first few episodes & the discs play fine so far! The picture quality is not the greatest (some episodes are noticeably out of focus which is a little disappointing) but they're not terrible. Overall I'm very happy with my purchase & any 80's or 90's kid should add this to their collection!,1517616000,,734,4.176056338028169

5579527,5,B00BCRRA8U,"I'm glad to see this on DVD, finally. The transfer looks very good for something transferred from 25+ year old master tapes.

The quality of the transfer is very good during season 1, but somewhere around season 2 (and for one episode in season 1), the picture quality got slightly softer and a bit smeared, which is what another reviewer was referring to as ""VHS quality"". I have two guesses as to what happened. 1) Shout couldn't get a hold of the master tapes, and had to work with backup copies or tapes retrieved from TV stations that once aired the show, or  2) That's how the master tape turned out, and that's what got transferred to DVD. Remember that in the late 1980s when this show was produced editing was done in the composite video domain from tape to tape so it's not beyond the possibility that equipment in the workflow might have smeared the picture a bit.

Attached are DVD video ""snapshots"" grabbed using VLC player to show you the quality of the transfer. The second one is from season 2 with slightly smeared picture quality.",1478822400,13,1048,4.5638297872340425

Season 1, 2, and 3 are all contained within the first case and season 4 fills up the other two cases. There are that many episodes in season 4. I'm not sure why. I didn't watch this show when it was airing on TV. The quality is decent. It's not a remaster or anything. It probably looks as good as it did when it originally aired, but it is an old show so expect to see some rough spots. Beetlejuice's character is surprisingly funny. He really does appreciate what normal people would think of as bad luck. He loves to eat beetles (although I've noticed he always crunches them off-screen), has powerful magic, and is hated by just about everyone but Lydia (including other beings like him from the Neither World).

I thought on the first episode that he was just going to make a bunch of lame puns and turn into his joke for comedic effect, but I soon learned in another episode that his powers are tied to what he says, so he has no control over turning into his puns after he's said them. For instance, one episode he casually says he can't get Lydia out of his mind, so she gets warped into his mind and then has to find a way out. I also want to point out that Beetlejuice and Lydia working off each other make the best episodes. There are some episodes (particularly in season 4) where Beetlejuice tries to carry the whole show by himself and it doesn't usually work. Also, being an older cartoon, there are sometimes where Beetlejuice pretends to be a girl to hang out with Lydia's friends. Now Beetlejuice is capable of transforming into almost anything with his magic and he has a twisted, disgusting sense of humor...so whatever. But when there's an episode where he's trying to win a beauty contest as a woman, all I can say is why am I watching this?

I can say I liked all of the first three seasons (the first case of DVDs), but season 4 has been half and half so far. I still have a whole other case of DVDs to go so I'm hoping I'm just in a slump. I'm glad I bought it after the price drop.",1469836800,8,2104,4.28391959798995

5579548,4,B00BCRRA8U,"I grew up with the Beetlejuice animated television show and this box set was a great nostalgic blast from the past. Finding the episodes on vhs was hard enough, I only ever had 1 or 2 and dvd's were non existent so I am glad the makers went ahead and put together the entire series in one convenient location.

The quality is good for the time frame it was originally aired in. No episodes have been remastered for that premium dvd experience but obviously it shows every episode, no skips, just as they aired in the early 90's.

It has loads of watch time- including 94 episodes within the box set.",1468540800,6,599,4.387387387387387

The reason for only 4 stars is due to the packaging.  Not sure if it was Amazon's fault or the Post Office's, but all 3 cases are cracked in multiple spots and due to this, the last disc is scratched a bit (it seems to play fine, but still).

While this is a complete collection of the entire series I cannot give it 5 stars. I think it is ultimately overpriced for a show that is many years old and especially since the dvds are episodes ONLY. There is no commentary, no interviews, no getting the cast back together, no behind the scenes artwork, no clips of the voice actors at work, nothing. For the money this boxed set cost, I would expect a little extra bang for my buck and because that is lacking this was a bit of a disappointment.",1383523200,,678,4.183206106870229

The quality of the videos are ok. I might have noticed some darkening during one episode, but it wasn't bothersome.

5579658,5,B00BCRRA8U,"Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice Beetlejuice!

  As a kid, I was a fan of the movie and I loved the cartoon. I was sad when ABC canceled it and it moved to Fox. Being the only child on the block without cable and an over the air antenna that got 3 network stations and PBS, alas, I never got to see the full series. So, the 3rd and 4th season were new to me. The change to the opening titles kind of freaked me. I like how Danny Elfman and crew stayed connected to the movie, while remembering it's a kid's show.

  The only thing that really bugs me (even way back when it was original.) Was how did Lydia and Beetlejuice become friends? Since, the trend these days seems to be resurrecting old shows and movies, perhaps they could bridge the gap.and explain how a 300 yr old dead man befriends and 13 yr old girl? Just a suggestion.

  Ok, back to the existing production. The cartoon is great fun! With kooky, yet lovable characters (i.e. my favs: Grimdiana Bones!, Prince Vince, Ginger the Tap-
dancing Spider, Bertha and Prudence! What the hey, I love them all! )  that make me laugh every time I watch. (I'm on my third round in collection! Can't resist!)

  Kudos, to Amazon... I received the dvd box set 8 days after my purchase, as the shipment tracker said I would. I started watching it that night. DVDs are all in tact, and no digital errors, and good quality.

  The only thing scary about this DVD was the price. Maybe, if Shout Factory included some special features, like commentary from writers, producers, voice actors. Otherwise, knock it down a bit for future buyers.

All in all it was a good show. Thanks for releasing the series.! It's showtime!",1378684800,,1660,4.461794019933555

5579670,5,B00BCRRA8U,"This show brings back some fond memories of my childhood. From such shows that I grew up with like the Real Ghostbusters and Rocko's Modern Life, Beetlejuice provided that much needed comedy and anarchy that kids of that era loved so near and dear.

The episodes are in order of air date and the video and audio quality seems great for a cartoon from the late 80's/early 90's. I don't think there was any cut outs like Nickelodeon did with the Rocko release, also from Shout Factory.

The only con was the special features ... which are nonexistent in this set. That was one of the things I was looking forward to - I would have loved to see the cast come back and do interviews. Seeing Tara Strong, who's become quite the leading lady of voice acting, come back and talk about her experiences with this show; she prominently voice Claire and Bertha. Or Allyson Court, who would go on to play Claire Redfield in the Resident Evil games, who played Lydia on this show. Or of course, the man behind the black and white stripe suit, Stephen Ouimette, who played Beetlejuice. Working on a show like this, you would think they would take the time to come back and talk about it, but either they didn't want to or it was lazy on Shout Factory's part not to do so. But oh well, at least we got the series, right?

Beetlejuice may not be the most popular cartoon series, but it is definitely a cult classic that will now live on for future generations with this complete series release. Perfect timing too, considering there MAYBE a sequel to the movie in 2014.",1375315200,,1553,4.461267605633803

Without any extras, and the range of quality for the digital transfers of the episodes go from ""poor"" to ""meh.""  Anybody expecting digital restorations will be disappointed, some of the episodes look like they were transferred straight from an old VHS tape.

Otherwise though, you do get a lot of cartoons to watch, and if you were into BJ then you'll like it anyway.  I'm not sure how much kids today would care for it today...

5579687,4,B00BCRRA8U,"For the first time, the long-running animated TV version of the Tim Burton hit horror/comedy movie has been released on DVD in its entirety (select episodes were previously on VHS).

It shouldn't be a surprise that ""Beetlejuice"" the TV cartoon is altered somewhat from the big screen version. The Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis characters are gone. Even Dick Cavett isn't here.

The Deetz's daughter Lydia still appears ""goth"" and likes dark, creepy stuff. However she's more of a Wednesday Addams in this show. The word ""goth"" is never spoken. The Deetz parents, Delia the artist and Charles the clueless, often appear in roles not too far from the parents on ""Phineas and Ferb.""

Most of the series takes place in the ""Neitherworld."" Since this is animation, the ability to create surrealistic settings is only limited by the stories, time and budget, which looks, for the most part, used to its best advantage. Like the movie, ""Beetlejuice"" the TV show can be disconcerting for adults at first, but it ""grows on you.""

Speaking of puns, this series uses more puns and literal takes on phrases than a Muppet Show or an Amelia Bedelia book. Beetlejuice has a tendency to say something and it happens, either to him or things around him, shades of Aunt Clara and Esmeralda, only with boogers and flatulence.

Which now brings me to possible objections of some parents to this series. The Neitherworld is chaotic, the tone of the show is loose and loony and Beetlejuice is smelly, greedy, sneaky and on the edge of insanity, though not as completely depraved as depicted by Michael Keaton in the film. BJ on TV, voiced by Stephen Ouimette, is a grittier version of Bugs Bunny, Robin Williams' Genie and Animaniacs. His cartoon visage is less Keaton and more Jon Lovitz.

In his weekly cartoonresearch.com column, Animation Anecdotes, our beloved pal Jim Korkis recalls a parent group that called the ""Beetlejuice"" show ""the worst ever"" in terms of mindless violence. That's quite an accomplishment in a medium that gave us ""Garbage Pail Kids"" as well as some of the gems bestowed on children today. Violence in cartoons is a subject unto itself. My wife and I tend to wait for what we see as the appropriate age for material, and it's different for each child. Some things are never appropriate just because they're awful, but this show does have some creative things going for it.

The animated Beetlejuice character is an antihero, but never seen as a role model. He's constantly identified as a nuisance, a bad example and is often rejected for his antics. The ABC version makes this point most directly, but the FOX Kids series actually makes Lydia as much a critic of her ""best friend"" as an ally.

""Beetlejuice"" was a huge TV success, spawning warehouses of merchandise. It's also the first animated series to have a simultaneous run on network TV and daily afternoon syndication.

Here's how it went: ""Beetlejuice"" premiered as part of the ABC Saturday Morning lineup and ran for three seasons beginning September 9, 1989 with thirteen epsodes the first season, eight the second and eight the third, which was typical practice for network cartoon series back then.

When Fox Kids began, the series highly touted. 65 additional episodes were guaranteed for Canada's Nelvana studio. So for eight weeks starting on September 7, 1991, viewers could see six new episodes. ABC continued their third season run with repeats, but FOX Kids rolled out all 65.

The first ABC season has been released on DVD as well, but with the complete, slipcased set, you get ABC seasons 1-3 and all 65 FOX Kids shows in another two packages, adding up to 94 half hour shows, that actually run about 23 minutes each.

The ABC and FOX Kids series seem similarities at first glance, but I found things that separate the two. On ABC, the Standards and Practices people surely insisted that a pro-social message be included, not that the daytime series is devoid of lessons learned. Sometimes Beetlejuice is the object of another's misbehavior and as Bugs did, he takes action (""Of course you know, this means war."")

More of the ABC shows take place in school and are centered around the issues of young people. The daytime show went more for a general audience, with endless references aimed at adults. Most kids would not get the very sharp jabs at traffic school, media, corporate life or politics that way adults would.

The animation is uniform in both series, with flashes of inspiration and genuine laughs despite the vulgarity and the quantity of episodes ground out. Like Warner Bros cartoons, Bullwinkle and the Muppets, frequent fourth wall breaking is the norm. Just as an FYI, Sally Field's Oscar speech is referenced three times over the series.

Also on the daily version, more time is devoted to the other creepy characters, like Jacques LaLean, Ginger the Tap Dancing Spider and The Monster Across the Street. Lydia is absent from a handful of shows, but her role is more often than not the voice of reason. The two series also have different theme song visuals with pretty much the same Danny Elfman music.

The entire series must have been post-produced on videotape, as many cartoons were at the time, so there are moments where images look blurry or out of register. Other than that, the overall impression after watching these shows is how consistently inventive and entertaining they are, considering how many were made. The ghost with the most was never at a loss for phlegmy fun,

BEETLEJUICE TV SERIES EPISODE GUIDE

SEASON ONE (Saturday mornings on ABC)

Episode 1
September 9, 1989
Critter Sitters
Lydia is asked to babysit little Arlo (think Swee'pea); Beetlejuice wants to buy Lydia a present but causes mass destruction when he becomes a baby and ends up in Neitherworld court. ""Banana Boat Song"" is heard several times, linking the first episode to the movie.

Episode 2
September 16, 1989
The Big Face Off
BJ and Lydia appear on the game show, ""The 24-Hour Gross Out."" The quizmaster is a vocal combination of Shelly Berman and Bob Barker.
Skeletons in the Closet
In the Neitherworld, skeletons are tattletales, and they do a lot of tattling on Beetlejuice.

Episode 3
September 23, 1989
A Dandy Handy Man
Like Lucy Carter on ""Here's Lucy,"" the TV Beetlejuice often uses wackiness to help others. BJ takes on some odd jobs -- and tangles with ""Ghost Tools"" -- to raise money for Lydia's photography show.
Out of My Mind
An exceptional episode in which Lydia enters BJ's brain. This plot is fertile ground for animation, from Disney's ""Reason and Emotion"" to Pixar's upcoming feature.

Episode 4
September 30, 1989
Stage Fright
Borrowing a page or two from ""Archie,"" (and what teen sitcom doesn't?) Lydia's snobby Veronica-like teen rival, Claire Brewster, debuts in this story about a school production of ""Romeo and Juliet.""

November 11, 1989
Poopsie

Episode 11
November 18, 1989
Prince of the Neitherworld
Depressed Prince Vince takes Lydia on a date -- with BJ close at hand. Note the reference to the four-hour ""Crying Clown"" movie -- is this a nod to that never-released Jerry Lewis film?

Season 4, Episode 5 (Series Episode 34)
September 13, 1991
Queasy Rider
""Born to be vile,"" Beetlejuice builds a ""hog"" and sets up a gang, leaving Doomie abandoned. Had this episode been made for ABC, they might have balked at BJ's offense at being called the ""N word,"" in his case ""nice,"" perhaps a trivialization of the real issue of the word.

Season 4, Episode 6 (Series Episode 35)
September 16, 1991
How Green Is My Gallery?
Delia is delighted to find herself in the Neitherworld where her art is acclaimed, until Lydia and BJ discover she cannot leave. This is one episode that makes it pretty clear that you have to be dead to reside in the Neitherworld, unless I guess you're a guest like Lydia.

Season 4, Episode 7 (Series Episode 36)
September 17, 1991
Keeping Up with the Boneses
Intent on impressing his new affluent neighbors, Beetlejuice gets a MonsterCard and promptly runs up a gigantic tab. The penalty is an excruciating amount of niceness, including cute kitties. In its wacky way, this episode is even more relevant today than in the '90s.

September 18, 1991
Pranks for the Memories

October 16, 1991

The Lost Souls Highway threatens to send BJ and his neighbors out of their homes and the mayor takes a payoff, so BJ decides to run against him - to ""put the 'P' back in campaign."" Very funny episode on many levels -- some things never change!

October 24, 1991

Twilight Zone-style story in which BJ gives Lydia a watch for the anniversary of their first meeting and it literally flies, so they follow it to the land where time ends up after it flies.

Season 4, Episode 35 (Series Episode 64)
October 25, 1991
To Beetle or Not to Beetle
Lydia can't understand her assignment to read Shakespeare, so Beetlejuice brings the characters to life. The premise also happened on ""Bewitched,"" and one of the throwaway lines suggests that writers borrow from old TV shows! This episode could assuage a few objections to the series -- after all, how many TV shows are about the works of Shakespeare (besides ""Gilligan's Island"")?

Season 4, Episode 36 (Series Episode 65)
October 28, 1991
A Star Is Bored
Beetlejuice goes into horror movies, changes his name to Rex and becomes a diva; as star of ""Curse of the Living Mummy, Part 7,"" he loses some of his technique and the public knows about his behavior -- so Lydia brings in an even worse actor to replace him.

November 5, 1991

Season 4, Episode 47 (Series Episode 76)
November 12, 1991
The Birdbrain of Alcatraz
Framed for stealing jokes, Beetlejuice is imprisoned. Even though Eve Arden already played Warden June in the 1982 movie, Pandemonium, the joke is especially clever in this episode -- Warden June is seen as a two-headed TV mom and dad.

Season 4, Episode 48 (Series Episode 77)
November 13, 1991
Generally Hysterical Hospital
In the Neitherworld, hospitals are more like fun-filled resorts, so when Lydia sprains her foot, BJ takes her to Seizure's Palace.

November 14, 1991
Super Zeroes
BJ enrolls in Bury Me Not's Supercilious School of Supernatural,  Superheroing and Comic Euphorium and a who's-who of heroes is skewered along the way. There's a character called Abby Cadabra, no relation to the Sesame Street Muppet that came later. BJ invokes the name of Jack Kirby.

November 15, 1991
Beetle Geezer
Changed into an elderly man, BJ takes Lydia's action-loving grandma to the Neitherworld Abusement Park, then Grandma leads a rest home revolt.

One character says, ""These heavily moralistic endings really slow down the show!""

Season 4, Episode 51 (Series Episode 80)
November 18, 1991
A Very Grimm Fairy Tale
As ""Mother Beetle Goose,"" BJ tells morbid variations on storybook favorites starring his friends, neighbors and/or prank victim, including ""Handsful and Regretful,"" ""Little Boo-Peep,"" Little Miss Stuffit,"" ""Old Monster Hubbard"" and ""Simple Slimon.""

Season 4, Episode 52 (Series Episode 81)
November 19, 1991
Wizard of Ooze
I enjoy almost any adaptation or spoof of ""The Wizard of Oz,"" but considering how far this series can go, it's a little too tame. Even Beetlejuice seems restrained. There are funny moments, though: the Munchkins call the place ""The Land of Public Domain"" and to get home, Lydia/Dorothy is told to klunk her heels together and say, ""Ripple dissolve to scene 28!""

Season 4, Episode 53 (Series Episode 82)
November 20, 1991
What Makes BJ Run
BJ: ""So, here's my plan. I'll con my way into a job at a network and, through a series of backstabbing and boot-licking efforts, I'll rapidly rise to the top of the heap, put our old show back on the air and totally humiliate Mr. Monitor in the process! Foolproof, no?""
LYDIA: ""No. You've only got about eighteen minutes left.""
BJ: ""Then we'll have to hurry!""
(Whew! Good thing this is just a silly cartoon and not at all like real life.)

Season 4, Episode 54 (Series Episode 83)
November 21, 1991
The Chromozone
A Rod Serling character asks Beetlejuice to find Ima Looney, a ""malignant growth of his own creation"" who has become a script doctor threatening to take his best ideas and make them mindless and airheaded. (Good thing that doesn't really happen either!)

Season 4, Episode 55 (Series Episode 84)
November 22, 1991
It's a Big, Big, Big, Big Ape
A tribute to ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World,"" in which BJ and company frantically compete to get hold of a Bing Crosby-singing ape that could make them a fortune. Lydia actually reminds BJ that ""we did a giant ape show already -- King Thong."" But BJ tells her that this is different -- it's ""King Bing.""

Season 4, Episode 56 (Series Episode 85)
November 25, 1991
The Neitherworld's Least Wanted

Mr. Big (with an Edward G. Rpbinson voice) leads The Society of Neitherworld Outlaws Thugs Rogues, Antagonists and Gangsters (S.N.O.T.R.A.G.) to destroy Beetlejuice.

I love this exchange:

MR. BIG: Bat Bunch roll call, count off nyaaah! Slimey? Grimy?

(to Lydia) Byaaah! Which Batty Buddy are you?

LYDIA (tossing a net): Annette!

Season 4, Episode 57 (Series Episode 86)

go with it. This is a unrealistic price for only a series that didn't last that long. How much longer will I have to wait to be able to afford this? probably YEARS. So ya...for me I can't even have it because of the unrealistic stupid outrageous price of this. Lower it to 20 or 30 then MAYBE I'll think about it. I would pay 70 for Seasons 5 through 12 of NYPD Blue on dvd except they don't exist!",1370044800,10,594,3.9173553719008263
5579695,5,B00BCRRA8U,"While some of the other reviews say the box is ""boring"", ""cheaply made"", and lacks extra material, I think the main thing to keep in mind is the cartoon itself is extremely good.  It could have arrived in a plain cardboard sleeve and would not have detracted from the quality of the show itself.  I saw the movie when I was young and just didn't get it.  However, when I discovered the cartoon after school one day, I fell in love.  It's wonderfully written, funny, tongue-in-cheek, and animated well for the time.  When I saw this available for pre-order, I jumped at the chance to have it in my collection.  I was worried it might not hold up.  Luckily, nostalgia did not over hype the product for me.  I found myself laughing at the jokes again and remembered why I loved the show as a kid so much... it's fun!",1370044800,,813,4.373333333333333
5579696,5,B00BCRRA8U,"Like alot of others, I've been hoping and waiting for years for this show to come out on DVD. At first, I went to Walmart the other day and my jaw dropped when I had saw the complete first season on DVD, so I quickly bought it, then after some searching, I realized that they hada complete series box set already made. I couldn't believe it, I took the First season back to the store and quickly ordered the box set before it was sold out. This was one of my favorite shows from my childhood and real excited to have all the seasons together. This also means I don't have to hurt my eyes watching them on youtube anymore with the poor quality. Even though I wished that there were bonus features and maybe a better DVD menu screen for one of the most beloved shows ever created, those are just the little things. Once again have to give props to the Shout factory for doing what no other company didn't feel like doing and that's bringing this show to DVD finally. Once again Shout delivers!",1369958400,,991,4.304812834224599
5579697,5,B00BCRRA8U,"This set does not have any extras. What it does have is the complete series of a well written and funny cartoon! I watched this on Saturday mornings, and I am now watching through them all with my children! Well, my ten year old fell in love and didn't want to stop! I thought the video looked great on my hi definition TV!

Though I know I should be wary,
Still I venture someplace scary;
Ghostly hauntings I turn loose....
Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice!

5 fives stars! thanks so much",1369872000,9,259,4.078431372549019
5579699,4,B00BCRRA8U,"I got this Beetlejuice Boxset the day it came out, I love this show and was very excited to finally see it on DVD! The bad news is the packaging is pretty boring, theres no booklets, no extras and even the menus are boring. The artwork on the boxes and discs is cute, but lazy. Multiple discs have the same picture on it. This is worth owning if you love this cartoon series, but dissapointing that it is so cheaply done!",1369785600,3,421,4.209876543209877
5579700,3,B00BCRRA8U,"Well when I was a kid I couldn't get into the film...However this cartoon makes up for all the questions I had
One when you die, why can't you leave your house but go to sandworm land and so on and so forth.  Besides Beetlejuice was hardly in the film.  Here in the cartoon he was finally the star, Lydia was aged down to 12 and looks like the character from Frankenweenie.  You get a better idea of the neither world, and I loved the characters Ginger the tap dancing spider, Jock La Lean the skeleton obsessed with working out, The monster across the street (who looks like Gossimer from Looney Tunes...all in all loved the cross between the living and the dead.  Cons, no Adam and Barbara Maitland, no special features.  Pros you get four seasons of a toung in cheek 80's/90's cartoon that made up for the film.",1369699200,2,814,4.4
