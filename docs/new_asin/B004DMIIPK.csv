I wanted ""Casino East"" - wanted the first half to educate me on how Wall Street actually functions...and dysfunctions. After I'm totally confused, I wanted some kind of personal drama as the whole thing goes to pieces.

Wall street ex-con Michael Douglas, just back from the can, has written a book, ""Greed Is Good"", and is out on his book tour. His future son-in-law attends a lecture and they strike up a hostile but respectful relationship. Looks like his daughter is holding a major grudge against the ol' crook and family destroyer.

Future son-in-law has another kind of ""green"" in mind - an environmentally friendly new source of energy. Douglas is, alas, still into the more traditional green. So is his new boss...and soon to be, ex-boss. This dude is even worse than Douglas! His ethics are so bad that even investigators temporarily forget what they are trying to investigate.

Susan Sarandon does a very interesting, ""Saturday Night Live"" caricature of a Mom from Queens - formerly in healthcare, she too pursues the big dollar signs - in real estate.

The market crashes, careers crash; market recovers somewhat; the ""new blood"" finds new ways to stay in the ""game"".

Magnificent cinematography as Stone's camera eye takes us to the top of skyscrapers, sweeping down to the countenances of the frantic players on the
streets, dodging taxi cabs. The location shots are well-composed. Don'y know why major corporations can't afford to turn a few lights on in board meetings, but, hey, that's movie-making. (Like how come the sidewalks are always blanketed with water? - it looks cooler).

Well-selected music, mostly from David Byrne, sounding at times like McCartney and at other times like Starr, weaves in and out.

I hope that a ""Director's Cut"" can actually feature ""cuts"", as in heavy edits in the never-ending denouement.

Not going to give away the ending...hint - it's not exactly non-""Hollywood""! The lengthy morality play suddenly morphs into Andy Hardy And The Billionaire.",1285545600,2,2029,5.069069069069069
4333361,5,B004DMIIPK,"2008 just before the collapse. Gordon Gekko, the man with the reptile brain in front, is back! A seriously ill Michael Douglas reprises one of his greatest roles as a Wall Street insider who used insider trading info to make a fortune and coined the phrase ""Greed is Good!"" before ending up for eight years in the Steel Bar Hotel. He loses it all (maybe) and is anxious to find a way to get it all back. And get back at those who put him there. But is he the major villain or not?

Shia LaBeouf stars as Jake Moore, a somewhat more scrupulous Wall Street green energy trader at Keller Zabel. Josh Broslin is Breton James the menacing Wall Street sleazebag Investment Banker who advises the Federal Reserve on what to do about another firm Keller Zabel  (owned by Frank Langella's character, Lewis Zabel) who has too many toxic loans. Breton James recommends the Fed refuse lend to Keller Zabel and driving them to bankruptcy. (A story taken right from the headlines, ala Lehman Brothers, for those with limited memories). The Lewis Zabel pleads with the Fed for help, reminds them other banks also hold toxic assets and then commits suicide jumping in front of a subway after his company stock share plummets. Hypercompetitive Breton James, we find, is illegally doing insider trading, advising the Fed while shorting the Keller Zabel stock secretly from an offshore account and then buying it up for pennies on the dollar. An ancient Eli Wallach plays a Wall Street banker old enough to remember the (last) Depression.

The plot elaborate goes on and I won't say more. LaBeouf and a weepy Carey Mulligan (An Education) playing Gekko's estranged daughter present the human backdrop as Wall Street scum make themselves rich and destroy the American Economy with Collateralized Debt Obligations, toxic loans and insider trading. The Fed tries to protect what's left of the totally bankrupt American economy, when they discover no money is left in America from people borrowing money to support a lifestyle they can't afford.

See Gordon Gekko define moral hazard and Ninjas (No Income, No Job or Assets). Gekko's character switches back and forth: villain to victim to sage to hero to villain, etc, in an Academy Award worthy performance.

There is a great scene of Manhattan, Wall Street at night, skyscrapers with electric ticker tapes flowing down the streets instead of cars. There is a graphic of the English Stock Market, the FTSE price collapse plotted against the London Tower Bridge profile and the Wall Street collapse plotted against the Manhattan profile. Stone's movie presents a fascinating use of special effects.

If this movie seems wordy, Oliver Stone is nothing if not a teacher...

A timely story. Today it has taken the Fed and the past and current administration years to fix the Great Recession caused by this era (and they are still working on it). Do you ever wonder why there haven't been any fraud convictions for bankers and brokerages who commited this and the Bush officials who let them do it? Certain people want to return America to this form of predatory Capitalism. ""Get the government off our (their) backs"" and so they can again steal The Wealth of Nations, whatever is left. Oliver Stone reminds us of the unbridled greed that caused our current problems in the first place. Some other reviewers didn't seem to get it.

One of the best movies of the year. One of Oliver Stones best. Everyone in America should see this movie! Highly recommended.

4333362,5,B004DMIIPK,"It's rare when a sequel can be said to be better than the original, but I think Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps is better than its 1998 progenitor Wall Street. Money Never Sleeps is a much more subtly complex movie than Wall Street. It seems almost a masters class in filmmaking.

Wall Street was misunderstood everybody took the Gordon Gekko ""greed is good"" speech as an endorsement or as a cheerleader for that philosophy without paying attention to the real message of the movie. This time I don't think director Oliver Stone is taking any chances on being misunderstood.

Michael Douglas reprises his role as Gordon Gekko fresh out prison for his insider trading sins. He's a man without a country, no one is there to meet him, he has legendary status in the trading world but he's forgotten by the real players in the game, and his family is either dead or estranged. Shia LaBeouf is his soon to be son-in-law Jake Moore, a Wall Street trader who is more successful and idealistic than Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) was in the original. After LaBeouf's company is burned by the greedy Bretton James (Josh Brolin) and his father figure mentor Frank Langella commits suicide, he seeks out Gekko. In Wall Street, Gekko was Faust showing Sheen's Bud Fox the world's treasures and the ways to possess them. In Money Never Sleeps, Gekko is more a guide to the labyrinth, but we're also not sure if Gekko may be the devil himself. There are twists and turns of changing fortune as all the players seek to out maneuver each other.

Stone's direction isn't as ham-handed and over the top as before, it's subtle. He still employs a lot of technique such as how he illustrates the ephemeral nature of money, at least the sums involved here, how it isn't quite real, and to the players it's just a way to keep score. The performances Stone gets are excellent. Michael Douglas plays this on so many levels, as washed up has been that tries to elicit sympathy from his daughter and perspective son-in-law, to able guide, to the lizard that still is Gekko. Shia LaBeouf has at last turned in a performance justifying the promise of his earlier roles. Eli Wallach continues his comeback with his role as Jules Steinhardt an old shark that age is dulling but he still has some power left in his bite, which can also be said for Wallach's acting.

There are a couple of minor missteps. The cameo of Charlie Sheen as Bud Fox almost comes off as campy, and may have been an inserted after thought of a scene. Susan Sarandon is almost criminally wasted as LaBeouf's mother, a role that because of Sarandon's presence should have been bigger or more important to the plot.

Wall Street Money Never Sleeps is a tour through a cut-throat world few of us get to see up close, and fewer of us understand but Money Never Sleeps is a tour you'll be glad you made.

4333363,4,B004DMIIPK,"""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps"" has many redemptive qualities about it in spite of its rather tentative, half-hearted use of the 2008 financial crisis and some conventional, only mildly textured plotlines.

Even when he is off-screen Michael Douglas is the driving force of the film with his natural, unassuming acting that is thoroughly convincing and unstudied-looking. The talent and charisma that won him the Oscar for playing Gordon Gekko in the original film are still on display here.

While Shia LeBeouf, as Jake, is the film's protagonist - a young man torn between becoming a ""Wall Street guy"" and the man his idealist left-wing fiancee Winnie, played by Carey Mulligan, wants him to be - he is only halfway engrossing and believable in his role. When you receive your acting pedigree from Nickelodeon and cereal commercials, it shows.

He still comes through with the passion and energy needed in a handful of crucial scenes, and he plays off other actors such as Douglas and Susan Sarandon, who plays his overly needy mother with a perfect Long Island accent, very well.

The incredible Josh Brolin plays Bretton James, easily the best cinematic antagonist of 2010. He makes James' suave conniving and cool malevolence pack extreme tension and dramatic pulse.

Frank Langella is likely to pick up another Oscar nomination for his supporting role as Jake's mentor, Lewis Zabel. His pensive, thoughtful, perfectly nuanced portrayal of inward despair, loss of hope and protection for his protegee is instantly heartbreaking and deeply impressive.

Mulligan both underacts and overacts, taking few risks in the more climactic scenes, mostly simply standing still and crying like a wounded bird. Of course, this may have more to do with Oliver Stone's directing choices.

The legendary Eli Wallach is well-used, particularly in some humorous moments. He remains to this day a formidable and authoritative screen presence, seemingly without trying.

The film is, indeed, too long. A solid 10 minutes could have been cut. It is easy to see Stone's temptation to leave it all in, however, since the story - if a bit tenuous on its grasp on current events, and unable to bring the audience into the nuts and bolts of Wall Street dealings - remains thoroughly arresting until five to ten minutes before the film reaches its surprisingly unambiguous conclusion.

Those looking for the finesse of the original ""Wall Street"" will inevitably find themselves unsatisfied, but Gordon Gekko remains a sharp, heavy screen presence thanks to Douglas' talent, and Bryan Burrough's story is mostly solid, quite engaging and leaves room for some very fine acting along the way.",1285372800,2,2669,5.159722222222222
4333364,5,B004DMIIPK,"Thank you, Oliver Stone, for creating another great film.

4333365,1,B004DMIIPK,"No wonder they pushed the release from March to September. This is the worst film to come out since Gigli. They should have never made a sequel to the the classic Wall Street. Money never sleeps will put you the sleep. The best scene was the cameo with Charlie Sheen and Michael Douglas which reminded me why the first movie was so good. To say the plot is convoluted is an understatement. Bottom line, there was no plot. The story was just a mishmash of 2008 financial crisis with reference to Lehman Brothers and that week in September when the government had to bail out the financial institutions. The script was awful and corny. The writers had to put in financial jargon such as CDO, CDS, Sub-prime, bailout at every opportunity just for the sake of it. More annoyingly, I think there was at least 15min's of footage of CNBC which added no value at all. I mean literally everyone from CNBC had a bit in the movie, Maria B, Cramer, the Brain, Mark Haines, the Korean anchor (I forgot her name), Becky Q. Even Roubini and Buffet were featured. There was so much filler in the movie, without it, it would have 30 min's. Oliver Stone himself had at least 3 scenes. The acting was atrocious. It's true Michael Douglas can't act. His Oscar in Wall Street was a fluke. His acting in this movie is the same as his others like ""A Perfect Murder"" where he also played a financier. Shia LaB and the Carey girl had no on screen chemistry. All in all the characters were shallow and unbelievable. Josh Brolin also didn't seem to quite fit in as a business baddie. And what was Eli W doing in the movie? Maybe they are going to do a remake of ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"", because Shia LaB's blackberry ringtone kept going off. For those who loved the original Wall St, the sequel is a travesty. Oliver Stone was lazy and must have been on high on drugs when he made this trash. There were so many references to the original Wall Street, it was a joke. Scenes in Central Park, boardroom scenes, trading floor scenes, even down to the scene with the real estate agent that sold Bud Fox his apartment was back in the sequel. Come on, at least think of something original!
I don't know how much money they spent on this film, but they should have given it to the government so they could have helped people out with their mortgages instead. I would have given this 0 stars if there was an option.",1285200000,9,2389,4.395033860045147
4333366,3,B004DMIIPK,"So first things first, I haven't seen the original Wall Street film from 1987 and know little to nothing about the market itself. Oliver Stone, who is certainly a very talented director, hasn't really made a film that I've loved. Considering all these factors, I was wondering how Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps would measure up. While a good portion of the film seemed to take solace in the massive amount of stock market jargon spewed throughout its entire duration, hiding underneath that layer of the film was where Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps truly shined.

The first forty five minutes or so of the film come off as slightly convoluted. It almost feels intentionally overly complicated in its execution, but once the film starts to present itself as more of a revenge tale for Jacob Moore and focuses on the relationship between Gordon and Winnie Gekko things begin to get a bit more interesting.

Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps is full of nothing but solid performances from the entire cast. The only weak link of the bunch was Carey Mulligan who seemed to just cry every time she was on screen. Michael Douglas steals the spotlight every time he's given screen time. This is the type of role he was meant to play. While Shia LaBeouf has shown in the past that he has some untapped potential as an actor, he really steps it up here and this could be the best performance of his career so far. The on screen chemistry between these actors is unbelievably strong. Any scene involving Josh Brolin and Shia LaBeouf conversing with one another is one of the best in the film. There's also the scene where Douglas is pleading with Mulligan to give him another chance as a father that is incredibly memorable. Watching the relationship between LaBeouf and Mulligan fall apart is really powerful, as well. This stellar cast is near perfect for this film.

While Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps starts off as a purposely baffling drama that revolves around the stock market and is somehow more talkative and dialogue driven than a Tarantino film, the film evolves into a rather intricate tale of revenge that is driven by nothing but strong performances all around. The film is worth seeing for Michael Douglas and Shia LaBeouf alone, but Frank Langella and Josh Brolin certainly have their moments as well. Even if you have no interest in this film, it's still worth giving a chance. It might surprise you.",1284681600,4,2411,4.7631578947368425

4333368,2,B004DMIIPK,"MONEY NEVER SLEEPS is a limp and flaccid sequel to one of the most impactful movies of the 80s, WALL STREET. Indeed, it is so limp and flaccid that it is almost impossible to believe it has the same director and the same star. If Oliver Stone is known for anything, it is using a megaphone with his microphone. But this film never rises above a murmur.

The plot is basically this: the notorious and once-Satanically charismatic Wall Street raider Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) is released from a long stretch in prison for insider trading, but discovers his fortune has evaporated and with it, his friends and influence. Cut to a number of years later. Gekko is eeking out a living writing books and appearing on talk shows in NYC but remains powerless and estranged from his daughter Winnie (Carey Mulligan). When Mulligan's fiance Jake Moore (Shia LeBouf), a do-gooding stockbroker, approaches Gekko in hopes of getting his blessing for the marriage (and in secret hopes of playing hero and reconciling the two), Gekko sees an opportunity to both reconnect with Winnie and position himself for a comeback. Meanwhile, Moore is investigating the circumstances at his firm which led to the suicide of his mentor Louis Zabel (Frank Langella), and begins a quest to revenge himself on the man he holds responsible, Wall Street titan Bretton James (James Brolin). This takes us on an in investigation of the forces leading up to the 2008 housing-market crash and the subsequent Great Recession.

In fairness, I have to start by saying MONEY NEVER SLEEPS had big shoes to fill. WALL STREET was a powerhouse of a movie, coupling Stone's slam-bang directorial, musical, and editing style with an all-time-great performance by Michael Douglas as the prince of temptation, Gekko. More than that, however, it was a clinical examination of the driving force of the 1980s: human greed, and the way it can seduce ordinary (if ambitious) people into doing unconscionable things. MONEY NEVER SLEEPS purports to examine the same motive, and its consequences for a different generation, but the movie is oddly restrained and underpowered, and the financial aspect is largely unintelligible. Michael Douglas is held in check until the very end, and his only really breakout moment comes when appealing to his daughter for a reconciliation -- a scene which is doubly poignant because Douglas was tapping into real-life grief over the issues his own son was having at the time. Josh Brolin looks mildly confused the entire movie and generates zero charisma as the villain. Even Shia LeBouf, who normally needs zero excuse to bug eyes and bulge neck-veins, seems curiously flat. The mostly lifeless screenplay fails to produce almost any memorable lines, and the one exception (""When choosing between evils, I always try the one I've never had before."") is actually a quotation from Mae West. In short, the movie, despite packing massive acting talent (this was Eli Wallach's final film) and a rather humorous cameo from WALL STREET star Charlie Sheen, doesn't muster a tenth of the firepower its progenitor did. Even the ending has a curiously forced ""happy ending"" feeling to it. In short, the entire project has very little of what Oliver Stone normally brings to the table, either pro or con. There is a certain atmosphere to the cinematography and lighting that is memorable, and there are a few moments that do connect with the audience, but that hardly compensates for its overall lack of chemistry and power.

Believe me, I really wanted to like this movie. WALL STREET is one of my favorite films and nothing would have pleased me more to see Gordon Gekko, even a reformed Gordon Gekko, chew through script and scenery again. But there are times you can go back to the well and other times you can't, and sadly, this seems to be one of the latter.",1515283200,,3837,4.927357032457496

Despite a cast of fairly notable actors there were no characters who provided any substance or gravitas to their roles. Even Michael Douglas seemed limited to not much more than corny off the cuff observations that the audience is supposed to attach great importance to because we know him so well from the original film.

Sadly, this movie pretty much represents the financial sham it seeks to expose. A bit of flash. A few celebrities indulging in activities of the rich and famous. An emotional heart tug here and there via a flimsy unconvincing romance and pandering to a popular social cause. And finally, no pay-off. Just buyer's remorse.

4333395,3,B004DMIIPK,"Yeah, Wall Street versus Main Street those kids from Occupy down the street from the august brokerage and financial towers of American business were on to something. Something that their grandparents called back in the Great Depression of the 1930s the economic royalists and today the one percent (1%-actually much less than that if you cut out the mere millionaires who are walking around with nothing but chump change these days when a billion is the starting point for anybody taking notice of your good fortune). Of course in the post-meltdown period since 2008 that idea has been played out many ways-not all to the benefit of Main Street in fact mostly not to the benefit of the great unwashed.
Still it is a little hard to understand why in 2010 the director Oliver Stone felt compelled to revisit his 1987 production of Wall Street from the days when half of America was in love with the Street and the other half wishing that they had some dough to throw at their dreams with his second coming of that classic-Wall Street-Two or to follow form Money Never Sleeps (true enough). In other words did we need to see a chastised Gordon Grekko giving his take on what ailed the Street in those bummer days after 2008 when one half of America got wiped out and the other half got conked with under water debt? Probably not but here were are so a few comments on the story-line seem warranted.

For those who remember Gordon Grekko, played by Michael Douglas, from the first film he was the consummate insider. A couple of decades and some serious stir time later he is a wiser man-sees where things are heading on the Street and like Cassandra wants to warn a candid world. A wiser man he may be but as the sub-theme notes money never sleeps and so our boy Gordon has seemingly lost a step or two since he was king of the hill. The big boys grabbling all the dough are now seen as heroes not bums of the month. But their day is coming.

This one takes a few big curves away from the machinations of the Street and tries to deal with things on a more personal level. It seems that Gordons estranged daughter Winnie, played by Cary Mulligan, has a boyfriend/fianc who is an up and coming, well, Gordon Grekko, working his ass off in a big investment house that is going under because it is carrying too much bad paper (and being undermined by a competitor investment house partner with a grudge). The boyfriend Jacob Moore, played by Shia LeBeouf,  is a go-getter for sure and winds up meeting Gordon on a book tour (Gordon has written a gloom and doom book portending the impending financial meltdown) and they strike up a bargain. Jacob tries to work to get Winnie to meet him and he will see what he can do to push Jacob up the Wall Street food chain (and especially get some traction for his clean energy project-the wave of the future).

For a while it was no soap-Winnie is still resentful about how Gordon let her brother fall through the cracks with a drug addiction problem that took his life. But eventually she softens (as well as being proudly pregnant). Then Gordon pulls a classic Grekko-proving that an old con will always be an old con (artist or vict). He has a cool one hundred million stashed in Switzerland just waiting for Winnie to grab it. She doesnt want it until Jacob talks her into using the dough to help finance the clean energy research. She does and signs for technical reasons the dough over to dear old dad. And he runs off and turns that nothing big one hundred million into a billion. Yeah, Gordon Grekko is back, the bad ass is in the saddle once again. But here is where the stir time or something plays-Gordon is worried about seeing his grandchild so he anonymously dumps the nothing big one hundred million on that research project. Nice touch. And they say Wall Street is just a big Ponzi scheme. Shame on them. But here is the big picture-those Grekkos are still in the saddle and who knows what they are up to now-no good for Main Street. Like I said I am not quite sure why Stone felt an urge to run this storyline again. What is needed is a plan to get rid of the bums.",1481414400,,4115,4.44635761589404

I was not sure at first if he was bad or good or to what degree of either in this movie.  Shia LaBeouf is a stand out actor too.  I first loved him in Transformers 1-3 (haven't seen 4) and he made me consider him a ""watchable"" in the modern age.  He had a unique way about him.

I thought he acted a good part and he reminded me of a Michael J Fox from my earlier days when he played the money man.  This movie was not a comedy and it was believable all the way through playing that role.",1459468800,,639,3.7954545454545454

4333431,4,B004DMIIPK,"My favorite movie of all time is Wall Street. This follow up, though really good, just doesn't quite hit that level. Now, that might not be fair to judge it in that light, but it's obviously a follow up to Wall Street so you sort of have to do that in deciding if you like it or not. Having said that, I liked it not only as a sequel but also just as a stand along good story. Though not necessary to see Wall Street, it certainly would help if you did simply because I don't think you'd get the point of what's going on as well if you didn't.

I really did not like the music score. I understand it's supposed to be more 'hip', but I just did not care for it. To me, the score just didn't mesh with the tone of what the movie was trying to accomplish.

Also, some of the acting was just a little forced, though Michael Douglas was just superb in making the transition from the vibrant Gorden Gekko in Wall Street to a more subdued character here. Still filled with cunning and greed, he just played his part right for what was needed.

Though not anywhere near the number of worthy lines to quote verbatim, Gekko did have some good ones to remember! All in all, Money Never Sleeps was entertaining, and had no dead spots. The main plot was good, and it certainly keeps your attention if you're into this type of movie.",1458172800,2,1319,4.205533596837944

4333468,4,B004DMIIPK,"Let me start out by saying it would be difficult to top the 1987 offering. The original film began with an up-and-coming Wall Street trader Bud Fox who's trying to break into the big time of financial trading, in other words trying to become a ""player"". He calls Donald Trump-like trader and deal-maker Gordon Gekko everyday for a long period of time who's day's pay is around $800,000 in 1987, more money than some people make in ten years. In ""Wall Street Money Never Sleeps"", the story begins from an entirely different angle. Gordon Gekko, once the biggest name in finance and deal-making, is getting out of jail. The limos are gone, his large office is gone, his private residence and private secretaries are gone, and his wife is gone. When he is led out of the prison gates, there is no one to greet him. Not even his children, who were young tykes in the previous film, don't seem to be around. We wonder what exactly happened to him. This is 2001, and we fast-forward seven years to the beginning of the events of this story in 2008.

The film cuts to a young finance guy, Jake Moore (Shia LaBeouf) who, not unlike Bud Fox, works as a trader for a finance brokerage firm, Keller-Zabel. Although, unlike Fox, he is not trading stocks and bonds but rather brokering financial deals, a la Bear-Stearns and Lehman Brothers. The story begins with rumors of Keller-Zabel's financial collapse because of investments in the so-called toxic prime mortgages and insurance default swaps which turn out to have been horrible investments. Louis Zabel, played by the incomparable Frank Langella, seems an honorable man but who made the bad investments which has, as a result, jeopardized the future of this firm. But at the same time, someone on Wall Street appears to have leaked rumors of Keller-Zabel's bad debts. The once powerful financial firm is on its way to the pearly gates of finance where it will meet the likes of Lehman Brothers and Bear-Sterns.

After the financial firm has been flushed into the financial sewers, Jake Moore lands a job with the current Donald Trump/Gordon Gekko finance wizard, Bretton James, played with incredible believability by Josh Brolin who is fast-becoming one of the best actors in the entertainment biz. (He had previously turned in a stellar performance in ""W"" as one of our former presidents, although I keep forgetting his name.) Their firm is an investment broker, much like Gekko's firm of the first movie. We also learn that James once worked for Gekko in the late 1980's and early 1990's.

But the relationship between James and Moore is not like that of Gekko and Fox. It is more of as an employer and an up-and-coming business associate rather than a mentor-pupil relationship. Moore recommends new investments, and he is pushing for a green energy company thats developing fusion, a much cleaner way to manufacture energy. James balks at the opportunity and decides to go with a much more traditional fossil-fuel company. One thing that was slightly unbelievable was the idea that a 24-year-old could so quickly be in the inner circle of a seasoned financial executive in his late 40's to early 50's.

Moore also just happens to be dating Gordon Gekko's daughter, Winnie Gekko (Carey Mulligan) who is disenfranchised from her father. He is peddling his new book ""Is Greed Good?"" Unbeknowst to Winnie, Moore begins having secret meetings with Gekko who claims he wants to repair his broken relationship with his daughter. Gekko also mentions that Winnie has 100 million dollars in a Swiss bank account which would be perfect for investing in the fusion-energy company. However, Winnie seems reluctant to re-establish a relationship with her father too quickly.

The shortcomings are the young leads who are interesting, although they are incredibly young to be doing what they're doing. LaBeouf seems like a recent college graduate whose confidence and knowledge seems more akin to that of a 35-year-old rather than someone only 24. At one point he confronts Brolin in a scene that was hard to swallow particularly because of the difference in age and experience. Is a 24-year-old really going to tell off a 48-year-old finance magnate he hardly knows and who could possibly ruin his financial career? Mulligan who appears about the same age is already running a very popular political website. Actually, I could buy into her job more than his, if only because website creation is the prerogative of the young, not financial firms. Charlie Sheen in the first movie was extremely convincing, and he seemed right where he should be for his age at the film's beginning. Sheen's eventual entry into Gekko's inner circle is a gradual process whereas LaBeouf seems too immature to be in the position he's offered, and too green to be able to confront Brolin as an equal.

Despite these reservations, a compelling story that works because it is not a re-telling of the previous movie. I think if the two young leads had been in their mid 30's rather than early 20's, I could have believed them more. Although the original ""Wall Street"" can probably never be topped, at least this movie works on its own terms, with several very compelling twists. Charlie Sheen has a wasted cameo as Bud Fox which seems at odds with how he ended up in the first movie. (I was hoping Bud Fox would be an important character but we see him only briefly.) Still, great performances by the two supporting cast members, Frank Langella and Josh Brolin, and of course high marks for Michael Douglas reprising his role as Gordon Gekko. Douglas very easily slips into Gekko's skin, always using ""pal"" when speaking to someone, akin to Jay Gatsby's ""old sport"". At first you think he's changed, but remember the letters in the word ""greed"" and ""good"" are contained in ""Gordon Gekko"".",1435449600,,5798,4.863360323886639

4333490,5,B004DMIIPK,"Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps is a film directed by Oliver Stone, a sequel to Wall Street. Michael Douglas reprises his role as Gordon Gekko Set in New York, the film takes place 23 years after the original and revolves around the 2008 financial crisis. Its plot centers on a reformed Gekko acting as an antihero rather than a villain, and follows his attempts to repair his relationship with his daughter Winnie, with the help of her fianc, Jacob. In return, Gekko helps Jacob get revenge on the man he blames for his mentor's death.

Ambitious young investment banker Jacob Moore discovers that greed is still the name of the game when he forges a fragile alliance with onetime Wall Street hotshot Gordon Gekko shortly after Gekko is released from prison. Having served eight years for securities fraud, money laundering, and racketeering, Gekko emerges from prison to find that his daughter, Winnie, prefers to remain estranged, and that his former Wall Street cohorts are still raking in the cash. Flash-forward to 2008, and Winnie is dating a proprietary trader named Jake Moore, who expresses a passion for green energy while working for his mentor Louis Zabel, of Keller Zabel Investments. Despite heading up one of the most prominent investment firms in the country, Louis Zabel is forced to personally fight for the future of Keller Zabel before the Federal Reserve after the company's stock takes a hit due to persistent rumors that it's being dragged down by debt. Denied a bailout from the government, Keller Zabel soon falls victim to a hostile takeover lead by powerful investment bank partner Bretton James, of Churchill Schwartz. His job on the line and his mentor out of the picture, Jake discovers that Gordon Gekko is out promoting his new book ""Is Greed Good?"" and decides to attend a lecture being given by the author at Fordham University. According to Gekko, greed is now sanctioned by the government, and the U.S. economy is on the verge of collapse as a direct result of leveraged debt and wild conjecture. When Jake goes behind Winnie's back to try and repair her relationship with her father, Gekko reveals his compelling theories on the likely reasons for Zabel's downfall. Later, as Jake begins plotting to avenge his mentor, Gekko starts to reveal his true colors.

It was great to see Douglas back in the role that won him an Oscar. But even when he's offscreen, he's a bigger presence than LaBeouf. Those who see him in the role of Gordon Gekko as an antihero worthy of redemption might find this kinder, gentler Wall Street worth sitting through. Though the carpe diem theme comes as something of a surprise, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps makes its political points, with 'moral hazard'the dark side of second chancesthe film's punny refrain.

Despite of rating it as an excellent sequel as it's more entertaining than many sequels ever made in Hollywood, Oliver Stone,who is directing a terrific cast, and a timely storyline that picks up where the original left off, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps should have been a classic. Unfortunately,it is not.",1422748800,,3090,4.927063339731286

The only downside is that the plot isn't exactly thrilling and the soundtrack tracks by David Byrne are probably the worst I've heard in any movie. If you have the mind to comprehend it this movie offers thoughts about living and finance, such as valuing time, family, and friendship, what leadership and independent thought look like in action, being wary of moral hazard, loyalty, financial concepts like selling losing trade positions before they get go too far, and avoiding leverage, financial bubbles, and considerations about power, control, and manipulation or as Gecko calls it, the game between people, among other ideas.

I really loved this movie.  Oliver Stone does a great job as well as Michael Douglas.  I love how it depicts big banks and Wall Street billionaires.  It's a fantasy world for me, and this movie does a great job portraying it.  It's not perfect, but now one of my all-time favorites.",1403049600,,514,4.1313131313131315

4333536,2,B004DMIIPK,"The original 'Wall Street' was a very successful and entertaining film. Michael Douglas even won an Oscar for his magnetic portrayal of the ruthless and unethical Gordon Gekko. Oliver Stone starts here with a decent idea, but the film lacks the style and conviction that made the original so great(in its time). There is too much time spent revisiting the past with an awkward cameo by Charlie Sheen and regurgitated dialogue from the first film. The uninspired script makes this one tedious for the most part and it makes this film seem too long. Even Gekko's speech seems like a flighty montage of the original. It does have a few good points, but its shortcomings make it one I won't be revisiting any time soon.",1399593600,2,715,4.728

4333573,5,B004DMIIPK,"""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Emerging from a lengthy prison stint, Gordon Gekko finds himself on the outside of a world he once dominated. Looking to repair his damaged relationship with his daughter, Gekko forms an alliance with her fianc Jacob, and Jacob begins to see him as a father figure. But Jacob learns the hard way that Gekko -- still a master manipulator and player -- is after something very different from redemption.

The cast led by Michael Douglas (excellent in reprising his Oscar-winning performance as Gordon Gekko) & Shia LaBeouf (solid as Jacob Moore) is excellent! The directing by Oliver Stone (who also produced) (who also directed the original ""Wall Street"" (1987, also wrote the story & screenplay), he also recently directed ""W."" (2008) & ""World Trade Center"" (2006) is excellent! The story & screenplay by Allan Loeb (who also did the screenplay to ""21"" (2008) & the upcoming ""The Dilemma"" (2011) & Stephen Schiff (who also did the screenplay to ""Lolita"" (1997) & ""True Crime"" (1999) is excellent!

The music by Craig Armstrong (who, recently did the music to ""The Incredible Hulk"" (2008) & ""World Trade Center"") is excellent!

This is a excellent film that keeps you entertained and thinking at the same time. This is an impressive follow-up to ""Wall Street"" after 23 years. Michael Douglas is not only excellent in this film, but he is terrific, as well. This is another hit for Oliver Stone, which is more in line with the movies that have impacted his career.",1369526400,,4601,5.3
4333574,1,B004DMIIPK,"I concur with the other reviews about the rambling story, the weak lead actor, the silly supporting characters, the intrusive musical score, and many other sins. And while the original Wall Street at least had a blue-collar hero we could root for, the characters we're supposed to empathize with  in this one are folks who get $1.4 million bonus checks or have $100 million stuffed away for them in Switzerland. But no less a disappointment for me was seeing how LITTLE the plot has to do with the actual financial crisis. It makes it appear as if 2008 financial system meltdown was about *equities* (the stock market). The actual financial crisis was about *derivatives* markets and credit liquidity -- but these concepts were obviously too difficult for Oliver Stone to understand. Moreover, the lead character, supposedly an expert on energy, is shown celebrating a little too early, because without question he's going to lose all the money he and the people he advised have invested in a technology that has *never* been on the brink of working, despite decades of development.  (BTW he still thinks it's a great bet even though the start-up takes only 6 months to burn through $100 million, and doesn't even have a working prototype: only in a fairy tale like this!!) ""Margin Call"" with Jeremy Irons, Kevin Spacey, Zachary Quinto et al. is both a far more realistic story about the financial crisis and far more entertaining.",1369526400,3,1431,4.909090909090909
4333575,1,B004DMIIPK,"Firstly, i loved the original movie. It was a great movie to watch while going through college for a finance degree. However, i hated this follow-up. Here's why:

Poor storyline,
Hated Shia and will never watch another movie with him in it again,
The focus on the daughter who was not even in the first movie timeline. Plus she was crying or upset in every scene.
The ending was terribly written to basically give you a hollywood ending.
There was no dramatic suspense, tons of plot holes, and no character development.
No moral of the story.
Michael's performance was the only reason i didn't turn it off early.

Plot twist example:
Shia's mentor commits suicide due to the financial collapse of his company at the hands of a competitor. Shia gets some revenge by tanking the competitor's stock. What does the bad guy do? He offers Shia a job of course, then screws Shia over. Shia then goes to get revenge again. Seeing a pattern of trust, betrayal, revenge here? Because it is the same approach between Shia and the daughter, Shia and Gecko, Gecko and the daughter, Shia and his mentor, The mentor and the competitor, etc..

To be honest, i am not going to waste more of my time reviewing this movie...it was that disappointing. Don't waste your time or money, because it never sleeps (such a bad tagline when compared to ""Greed is good"").",1366761600,6,1342,4.654008438818566

4333589,5,B004DMIIPK,"""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps"" (2010) is a great movie in surprising ways, not obvious, but worth thinking about!

First, it's different than the excellent and deservedly praised and honored ""Wall Street"" (1987) movie starring Charlie Sheen and Michael Douglas.

""Wall Street II"" is good for different reasons. Don't compare apples to oranges! Different, both good, but not for the same reasons.

""Wall Street II"" is worth watching (again and again) for several reasons:

1. Great acting by superstar actors like Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen (not credited, but part of the movie for about 60 seconds....the best 60 seconds in the movie!).

The ""accidental meeting at a party"" of 1987 ""Wall Street"" stars Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen is electric. These two guys are dynamite, and when mixed, produce incredible dramatics not seen in the rest of the movie, or in most other movies, anywhere.

Two superstars, no other way to describe them.

The movie is worth watching just for the quick take sequence which includes the return of ""Bud Fox"" (Charlie Sheen) meeting up with ""Gordon Gekko"" (Michael Douglas), both recently out of prison for ""insider information victimless crime"" offenses, and both doing great!

You'll go a long way to see better, more dynamic superstar actor work than these two guys provide in this movie.

It's explosive, and it's precious. Anyone who cares for incredible acting MUST see the Gekko and Fox Meetup part of the ""Wall Street II.""

2. Michael Douglas is an incredible actor of high gifts. He deserved his Best Actor Academy Award from ""Wall Street I"" (1987) and this movie (""Wall Street II"") shows that with good writing and the right story, he can do the same good work, again and again and again.

It is a pleasure and a privilege to see the great Michael Douglas act in ""Wall Street II."" His Dad, Kirk Douglas (aka ""Isadore Dempsky"") would be proud of son Mike.

His weight in the movie is bad, and director Oliver Stone wisely shoots around the newly enlarged (too big) waistline Mike has in ""Wall Street II.""

But...what the hell? Nobody's perfect.

Other ""nobody's perfect"" fat movie stars in the movie include Sylvia Miles (see her before she gained weight in ""Midnight Cowboy"" [1969], and Susan Sarandon, who plays the mother of the young man star of the movie with a the strange name ""Shia LeBoeuf"" or something like that.

The commentary (available on the DVD versions of this movie) of Oliver Stone is wonderful.

Stone went to two famous prep schools (Trinity School in Manhattan, and the Hill School) and then went to Yale U. Then to NYC Film School.

He is an educated, cultured man, and his commentary is filled with references to Greek mythical figures like Tiresias and others one learns only when one goes to the best-of-the-best classical eastern USA private schools....which Oliver Stone did!

The DVD commentaries part of ""Wall Street II"" are a pleasure to listen to, and that is also true of other commentaries Oliver Stone provides for other DVD's I've seen and heard done by him, especially including his ""W"" movie.

He's smart, interesting, and his company is for sale in these DVD commentaries, and he's worth inviting to dinner!

Make sure the dinner you provide has gourmet tasty food and a beautiful, intriguing, promising female dinner partner for your guest, Oliver Stone.

Great company from a smart, interesting, intelligent, and gracious man.

Get this ""feel good"" movie and keep it close.

You won't regret it!

4333600,2,B004DMIIPK,"A pretty amazing statistical observation of this film's reviews here on Amazon; of 167 reviews (as of 10/6/12) 20% are 5 star, 22% are 4 star, 17% are 3 star, 18% are 2 star and 22% are 1 star. These stats alone have made me (possibly) reconsider my view of this film....Seems pretty rare to find a film with such a wide range of opinions.

For my part I agree that this is a weak film, somewhere between 2 and 3 stars. I appreciate Oliver Stone, his kinetic, detailed exhibitions of masculine ambition, anger and occasional depravity are almost always watchable and layered enough to reflect a consistent world view and style. No stranger to Violence or it's more sophisticated and interesting counter, Power, his stories are usually about unlikeable people (Gekko, Barnes, U-Turn's whole cast, Savages, (can James Woods be likeable?), Nixon, Castro, Talk Radio) who can't help themselves pursuing their ambitions and temptations. I will make an effort to see his films until he craps out too much, and even then I'll give him a chance. Look at Woody Allen, lots of misses lately, but a few terrific and great films too. An artist can't hit home runs all the time; a ground out to second is inevitable now and then.

Wall Street 2 is not a good movie. Calling it Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps doesn't isolate it from the original. This is a sequel. It felt so labored and predictable, and as opposed to the first film, it wasn't of it's time, it merely tried to comment on it. I don't know which moment was worse: Charlie Sheen showing up as Bud Fox at some charitable event with two models on his arm, playing Charlie instead of Bud or the Clark Kent to Superman moment when we're told that Gecko is back in full player mode because he slicked his hair back like in the old days. These moments highlight the cheapness of Stone's direction and the sense that this was made because the opportunity presented itself, not because the story had to be told.

Certainly the financial collapse of '07-'08 will be a story motif for many years to come. The circumstances and out comes resound to this day and are scarier and more vile than the antics of Tony Montana or the drug dealers of Savages.

Josh Brolin is the best part of the movie, he can command the screen and has a hulking presence and physicality that was also memorable in American Gangster. Surely the  drive that gets people to the highest floors of some of the largest buildings and businesses can't be abandoned once they are assured of their positions there. The snake can't help but eat it's tail. Sorry for another metaphor.

Carrie Mulligan is wasted as the suffering daughter of Gekko, who rebels against the family business by operating a non-profit independent journalism website. Her role is to facilitate heart, since her father has none, or not much of one or is really out of practice using it. Susan Sarandon is wasted even more. The disparity between the careers of talents like hers and comparable men is pathetic. She gets to smoke and act stupid, begging her brilliant son to save her. The women in Stone's films are usually badly drawn and either ball busters or weak. At least he is consistent though. And Shia LaBeouf, who is a better actor than Charlie Sheen for sure, just feels like another big budget American movie character; uber smart, very successful, cool and honorable. Matt Damon may have played this part 10 years before. You know, a flawless character who is a foiled by a darker, more cynical outside world that he seems surprised to discover.

Ultimately this film makes me feel more cynical about it's production than the story it aims to tell.

4333602,5,B004DMIIPK,"I've come to the conclusion that a lot of the people who don't like this movie simply do not understand it. It is different from the first movie in that it is not, at least in my opinion, quite as plot driven, although it does have a clever plot which centers around a series of ""trades,"" between La Beouf and Douglas. I love this movie because it is an expose of Wall St greed, and prevalent modern day economic theory. There many subtle themes which I find fascinating and inspiring. Does anyone notice how Stone's vision of alternative energy is not solar panels, and wind mills, which the movie exposes as a fraud that Wall St invests in because they could never be a threat to oil holdings? Rather, this movie promotes nuclear fusion powered by seawater as a true way to make energy abundant, cheap, and clean for mankind. Also, I like how the Founding Fathers lurk in the background of this movie, teasing the audience with the reminder of how the institutions and policies which these men gave us have been spit on by Wall St. American flags loom large on the Wall St trading floors while these traders actively wreck the American economy. The Federal Reserve board members sit under portraits of Washington and Hamilton as they run our country's monetary policies for the benefit of the British Empire.

This movie is also wonderfully edited with great montages and segues, as well as a great soundtrack. As another reviewer said, a wonderful thing about this movie is how  it is, in many ways, an homage to the first Wall St. The David Byrne soundtrack, the realtor, the Charlie Sheen cameo, and the last song all serve this purpose. It pays tribute to the first movie in a very fun way, while also being completely original as its own film. Sometimes I can't decide which movie I like better. Also, the image of bubbles is prevalent throughout the movie and is very clever.

4333603,4,B004DMIIPK,"If you're like me, some of the technical details may go past you, but there's an interesting story here even without understanding about credit default swaps and hedge funds. Jake Moore (Shia LaBeouf) is an eager young trader who is in love with Winnie Gekko (Carey Mulligan). Her father, Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) has just been released from federal prison for insider trading and other dirty tricks. Since he's about to become Jake's father-in-law, he wants to reconcile father and daughter.

That's one story thread. A second is the impending meltdown of the entire financial market, and how blood-sucker Bretton James (Josh Brolin) has made millions on the suffering of others, including Jake's mentor, Lou Zabel (Frank Langella), who commits suicide when his firm is forced to sell to James for $3 a share. So vengeance for that is another goal for Jake.

Meanwhile, Jake is also trying to promote the stock of a geothermal/fusion power system Dr. Masters (Austin Pendleton) is developing, which may or may not ever work. Among others, he attempts to sell it to some visiting Chinese.

There are a lot of threads to this story, so don't feel bad if once in awhile you don't really understand what they are talking about. Generally the dialogue will telegraph what is honest and what is not.",1336694400,,1300,4.926940639269406

Of course you do.

How does this happen? Answer: it's the game of power taking over the elected politician's soul!

This movie displays this power game in a marvelous way. Game playing, now and through the ages, has nothing to do with left or right politics, capitalism or communism, Muslims or Christians, Buddhists or Hindus, rich or poor, ""good"" people or ""bad"" people, winners or loser... it's all about who's in charge. It's the powers of the universe narrowed down to: who controls the room. And, to control the room, you don't have to have a single dime in your pocket, just play the game at full power and you win the room. When you've won the room, you stay on the game 'til you win the world!

Being a faithful Hollywood friend, Oliver Stone had to put a few left leaning punches in here and there but it's not overdone. Love his subtle hints of potential ""dangers"" luring during the flow of the story... be prepared to be surprised, but not in the typical movie style way; Oliver is one clever dude...

You can play this game also - anytime! And, may I confess, I played it too... in my troubled youth :)

4333605,4,B004DMIIPK,"Originally I bought a ticket for another movie and did not see it because this movie turned out to be a lot better than I expected.

Framed as a revenge movie, the inciting incident occurs when young idealist, and greed prone Wall Street trader, Jake Moore's mentor dies in a tragic way. Jake wants to get to the bottom of the mystery of why he died, and get justice for the mentor.

He happens to be dating Gekko's estranged daughter, and so contrives to meet him, and that is where this cautionary tale begins. Michael Douglas has made a career out of playing flawed yet charismatic and engaging characters, ultimately steps in to fill the mentor void, and clearly Gekko's time in prison has given him wisdom, but has this particular leopard changed his spots. You get the awful sense that this idealistic yet naive young broker is swimming with sharks and may get eaten.

Gekko, as his name suggests, is reptilian in nature, and as we know reptiles do not nurture their young or have emotions, and are cold blooded, and ruthless.

I loved the image and the metaphor of someone blowing a huge bubble in the park.

What I found particularly engaging about this movie were some of Gekko's soundbites.

You stop lying about me. I'll stop telling the truth about you.

Bulls make money. Bears make money. Pigs get slaughtered.

The villain of the movie is Tretton played with much charisma by Josh Brolin. Some of the plot points, I found implausible. For example Jake Moore spreads a rumor that causes Tretton to lose $128 million, and Tretton's response is to offer him a job with his organisation.

I don't about you, but if some young idealistic broker flat out tells me that he blames me for his bosses death, and costs me that much money, I would not be offering him a job or going motorcycle riding with him.

The contemporary side story of the housing market is developed, and part of the collapse at least can be attributed to Wall Street greed, and also more individual greed. Jake's mother, played by Susan Sarandon is a real estate agent who fixes and flips houses, and gets cuaght when the housing market turns.

Like many people Jake is a paradox. He gets a huge bonus check and somehow loses it all, and later bails out his mother even though he himself is broke. This guy makes his living advising people how to invest, and then invests in margin on his own company's stock.

Money never sleeps is ripped from the headlines and topical, because we are still in economic turmoil because of the excesses of Wall Street, and the banks, and all the frauds and the bailouts.

What struck me most from from this movie is that we are all prone to the excess of greed, most of us want to be rich.

I think Michael Douglas does an excellent job, which could easily have gotten another Oscar nomination, for this reprise of his Oscar winning role. I have a high respect for Oliver Stone, not merely as a director but also as a screenwriter, as here.

I encourage you to see this movie, because you will realise that some of the people who offer you advice talk the talk, but don't walk the talk, and it might change your perceptions about how you manage your money, and who you get to manage it. That insight ultimately might be worth more to you than the modest price of seeing this movie or buying the dvd.

Good judgment comes from experience, yet experience comes from bad judgment.

As expected, Michael Douglas cooly plays a seasoned (post-prison) Gordon in masterful fashion. Regrettably, Charlie Sheen chose not to give life to Budd Foxx, which could have given the movie endless plot twists. He appears briefly in a cameo with a couple of babes, as seems appropriate.

The plot is based on the 2008 derivatives crash, and follows the facts fairly accurately. Gekko emerges poor from prison, and deftly turns a hidden $100 million from a secret swiss account into a $Billion. Naturally, he does it by deftly calling the bottom perfect during the freefall.

4333610,4,B004DMIIPK,"At the risk of being vilified by my fellow reviewers I will delicately scamper out on that metaphorical ledge to opine that I very much liked the sequel WALL STREET:  MONEY NEVER SLEEPS.  I enjoyed the continuity to the bawdy and delightfully rap scallion original; yet even more I enjoyed the evolution of ornery Gordon Gekko (and Michael Douglas was born to play this role).  As this film draws to its conclusion director Oliver Stone actually has this hombre exhibit some (slightly) redeemable qualities.  That surprised me (in a pleasant way) and added to my enjoyment of this mellower tale of wheeling and dealing in utopian green technology in this the cyber age.

Yes, Gordo is out of prison and looking to rebuild his financial empire; but he's also looking to reconcile with the only family member he has left, his estranged daughter, Winnie (Carey Mulligan, grow your hair out, please).  And over the course of these endeavors he happens to impress--and accordingly become the mentor of--Winnie's fiance, Jake (could someone please inform Shia LaBeouf his fifteen minutes of fame has ended?).  LaBeouf is the definite weak link in this ensemble; he can talk stock options, leverages, buyouts, and mergers all he wants, but he still looks like a 9th grader trying to sneak a peek into the girls' shower.  This distraction, however, did not (overall) take away from my enjoyment of the film.  Other solid performances include Frank Langella as Jake's former employer and mentor and Josh Brolin as the greedy, unethical uber villain.  But then again, Josh could read the phone book and still come across as conniving and maniacal.  But the ultimate treat was Charlie Sheen making a cameo as bad boy Bud Fox.  And we find out that, twenty years after having gotten his Road to Damascus comeuppance, he hasn't learned a blasted thing.

As a scheming capitalist, I loved it.

As for Eli Wallach, the blessed old gentleman, and his whistling, bird-like noises and weak gesticulations:  Why?

I suppose WALL STREET:  MONEY NEVER SLEEPS gets so many raspberries from so many disappointed viewers due to the fact the protagonists don't collapse under the metaphorical houses of cards built by their own greed.  There is actual reconciliation and reclamation; I know, I know, for evil 1 per centers that's absolutely unthinkable.  Then again, this is a different time than the Eighties, with its Cindy Lauper tunes and poodle hair-dos.  Gordon Gecko has mellowed; maybe the rest of us should do the same.

4333612,1,B004DMIIPK,"I have to hand it to Oliver Stone; it takes real talent to create a film with absolutely zero sympathetic characters- in fact, each character is more pathetic and unlikeable than the one before....

1. Winnie Gekko- spends the entire film in a self-absorbed, self-pitying pout, simpering about how her father is responsible for All That Is Bad and complaining that her fiancee needs to ""make a difference""- what does she do?  Write for some blog.
In the very first scene, she tells LeBouf to turn off the tv because her father is on it. When he doesn't instantly comply, she breaks the remote- then announces ""I'm taking a shower.""  Umm, why didn't you just go do that, and let him watch what he wanted? Later, she'll whine over dinner, whine over her massive engagement ring, whine that her father is responsible for the suicide of her brother,* whine whine...ugh, I kept wishing LeBouf would walk away. Why is she with him?  (Oh, and she ""doesn't care about money"" knowing damn well she's got $100 mil waiting for her when she hits 25.  Hey, I can totally relate, lady.  Really.)

2. LeBouf's character- gets a $1.45 million bonus and instantly spends a third of it on a rock.  Hey, remember that energy company in desperate need of money? Ever consider that might be a better investment, doofus?  Then he insists on pushing Winnie and her dad together- why?

3. Gordon Gekko- introduced telling a cliche-ridden, ponderous lecture.  Whatever.  Later he tells LeBouf that Lou's suicide was ""honorable.""  Lou had an adoring wife, a townhouse, more money than he could ever begin to spend, we can assume grown children and grandchildren, but kills himself because at 75 he can't manipulate money any more.  I wonder how much of his fortune he left to the thousands of loyal former employees?  Now that would have been honorable.

4. Eli Wallach's character- seems to exist because Stone needed a dessicated zombie in a suit to spit out four lines and make stupid whistling sounds while gesturing with one hand.  What the hell was that?

5. Josh Brolin's character- as pointed out in a previous review, this guy looks like he should be sitting in a fake volcano petting a cat, planning to nuke the world's economy with a laser satellite.  Too much.  On the other hand, I can't see what makes him a villain- he started a rumor?  Yeah? So?  LeBouf's character does the same thing in revenge.  Is he going to jail at the end too?

6.  The insipid green energy scientist- seriously, buddy, shut up.  I'm as green as they come, and I started to wish an oil slick would engulf your laboratory.

7.  Cameos by Bud Fox and the relator from the original film- as if ""Wall Street"" wasn't already desperately referenced enough before that, with the terrible Talking Heads-lite soundtrack and an awkward ""remember Blue Star?"" conversation between Douglas and LeBouf.  Talk about wrecking the message of the first film- see, Bud didn't learn the lesson that money isn't everything after all!  He came out of jail, went right back into wheeling and dealing, and got rich!  Jeesh, this would be like a sequel to ""A Christmas Carol"" in which Scrooge is a miserly, bitter, lonely old man again.  What WAS the point of the first film again?

8. Susan Sarandon as house-flipper; Sarandon clearly decided to simply embrace every cliche'd image everyone has of realtors, down to the waving cigarette and fast talk.  After all, she's got maybe two minutes of screen time- why put in any work at all?

9.  The non-plot: Is it about green energy?  Not at all.  Is it about father-daughter relationships? Hardly.  Is it about Wall Street, Greed?  Not that I could follow.  Is it about the power of rumors in the internet age?  Well, that might make a little sense, but it's so exaggerated, what's the point?  A sequel 20 years in the making which, in the end, was simply not worth the time.

*Winnie can't bear to be with her dad even for a few seconds over dinner, and when she doesn't get his absolutely undivided attention, she throws a fit and walks out.  Maybe someone should tell her that the only reason Rudy committed suicide was because his name is mentioned in the original Wall Street movie and Stone felt he had to explain his absence from the sequel, plus he needed a reason for Winnie to hate her dad.

4333613,2,B004DMIIPK,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

  If you haven't already discovered it, Oliver Stone is a preacher. His movies always boil down to the proverbial 'us vs. them'. Back in 1987, with the release of the first 'Wall Street', there was some ambiguity in Gordon Gekko's famous phrase, ""Greed is Good."" Although Gekko was a bad guy, there was something charming about him, so one could still feel sorry for the rapacious financier even though he's being sent away to prison. In his later days, Stone's sense of subtlety has waned. While he still holds a great attraction to the world of wealth and privilege (after all, he is a very well off in real life), it would not be politically expedient for Stone to identify himself with the 1% crowd. Thus, the heroes of Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps are (in terms of today's nomenclature) the 99 per centers, who completely reject the ""greed is good"" mantra.

  'Money Never Sleeps' is set in 2008, the year of the Wall Street financial meltdown. If it were today, Stone might have had Jake, his proprietary trader protagonist, hanging out for a few hours in Zuccotti Park each day. Even though Jake professes his love for the 'green', he'll only invest in progressive companies that promote alternative energy. And his girlfriend, Winnie, who also happens to be Gordon Gekko's estranged daughter, runs a small website designed to expose one percenter shenanigans. Jake's mentor at his firm, Keller Zabel Investments, is Louis Zabel, another ""word is my bond"" good guy amongst the wolves, who can't take the heat when the firm loses 30% of its value at the beginning of the 2008 crisis. His solution is to jump in front of a subway train after one percenter bad guy Bretton James (Josh Brolin), CEO of Keller Zabel's rival, blocks a bailout for the troubled firm .

  Enter Gordon Gekko, ex-con, who wants to re-establish a bond with his daughter. He conscripts Jake by making a deal with him: if Jake can help him reconcile with Winnie then he'll provide information that can sink Brett. Jake uses information that causes Brett's' firm to lose $120 million but Brett inexplicably offers Jake a job. Jake's plan is to take revenge on the evil Brett who he holds responsible for his mentor's suicide. There is some hint that although Jake intends to undermine Brett from the beginning he's seduced by the wily CEO after Brett promises to steer a Chinese company toward investing in the fusion energy company Jake's been touting. When the economic crisis affects the firm, Brett plays it safe by promoting bunk solar panels and fossil fuels to the Chinese. Jake throws a fit when all bets are off for his fusion energy company; his 'dark moment of the soul' occurs when he blows his cover by cursing out Brett and getting himself fired.

  The solution is that Gekko reveals to Jake that he's had $100 million stashed away in a Swiss bank account all along and needs for his daughter to sign the money over to Jake who will in turn hand it over to Gekko who promises to invest it all in the fusion energy company Jake's trying to save. At first, Gekko appears to be returning to form when he disappears with the $100 million and the fusion company appears to be sinking like the Titanic.

  Jake's revenge plot against Brett turns wimpy when he merely gives Winnie some information that she publishes in her blog, leading to Brett's downfall. If you can believe that the unsubstantiated rumors in a small left-wing newspaper can destroy this powerful CEO, then perhaps I can sell you the Brooklyn Bridge. Whatever the case, Jake's passing of information to his girlfriend, is hardly the stuff of exciting denouements.

  The ultimate wimp-out of course is Gekko's decision to join the 99 percenters by returning the $100 million to the now reconciled couple and get to see his grandchild a year later. The good guy crowd wins the day by shouting the new 2008 mantra: 'Greed is bad'. Had 'Money Never Sleeps' been filmed during the time of OWS, Stone would have had Gekko along with Jake, Winnie (and a photo of the deceased Zabel) snuggle up together inside one of the newly minted pup tents in Zuccotti Park.

  Shia LaBeouf is really perfectly cast to play Jake. The actor who usually plays hotheads (and is a hothead in real life) shows himself to be more comfortable in a place like Zuccotti than inside an investment bank. In 'Money never sleeps', his rebellion takes the form of some wild riding on a motorcycle and well as cuddling with his 'greed is bad' significant other.. Carey Mulligan has little to do as liberal blogger Winnie but Josh Brolin is more enjoyable as a sinister over the top head honcho. Frank Langella is stuck in the role of the kindly mentor Louis Zabel and is too idealistic a character to be believable. Michael Douglas manages to pull off some real acting, particularly in the emotionally powerful scene when he first makes a real attempt to reconcile with Winnie. But the absurdity of Gekko suddenly reversing course at the film's climax, undermines all the good acting Douglas had done beforehand.

  'Money Never Sleeps' is Oliver Stone's attempt to be accepted by his middle-class audience. There is no chance anymore that Gordon Gekko can exist as both good and bad at the same time. Gekko can now only be good in the present. The bad guy of today, the Brett's of this world, the one percenters, must be thrown under the proverbial bus. In reality, however, none of the 'villains' of the 2008 economic crisis were called to the bar of justice. Quite the contrary, they made out like bandits! Thus, Stone's comeuppance of the one percenter crowd, rings as false as the idealized crowd of do-gooders he creates, that are depicted going to battle with them!",1323129600,6,5738,4.726452905811623
4333614,3,B004DMIIPK,"""Money Never Sleeps"" could have been fantastic. And the timing was perfect for director Oliver Stone to explore the changes that had occurred on Wall Street since the 1980s. Alas, the critics are right on this one. The financial meltdown of 2008 provides a great backdrop, but Stone manages to squander most of his opportunity.

How? The main culprit is the weak script. All the Wall Street stuff crackles with energy, but the situation involving Winnie, Gordon Gekko's daughter, and her fiance and father just doesn't add up to much. Michael Douglas is excellent as usual, and really tries to sell the idea of Gekko as a man torn by his old lust for power and greed and his need to reconcile with the one family member he has left -- but I just didn't buy it, and that's the fault of the screenwriting, not the actor. Douglas exudes charm as always, and the scenes involving him getting out of prison are at once humorous and heartbreaking, but the film quickly loses steam.

But there are mediocre performances, too. Shia Labeouf has all the tools he needs to make his character -- Winnie's fiance Jacob Moore -- a fascinating study, but for reasons I can't quite articulate, he doesn't quite pull it off. What is it with this young chap? He was truly marvelous in ""The Greatest Game Ever Played,"" but since then seems to have made a career of being underwhelming in some very big movies -- the fourth ""Indiana Jones,"" the ""Transformers"" series, and this. As for Carey Mulligan: She pulls out all the stops (and the tears) in her performance as Winnie, yet ultimately I found it very difficult to care about her.

I still give the Blu-ray release three stars, though, because of the extras, which actually eclipse the movie in terms of quality. There's a lot of material here about the way Wall Street works ""then and now,"" and also a really fine little history of that area of Manhattan that was more gripping than just about anything else on the disc. Too bad the feature itself falls short -- but I got it used, and all in all I think I made a wise investment. ;)",1321747200,3,2068,4.553763440860215
4333615,2,B004DMIIPK,"I can't think of a single thing to recommend about this movie.  The original ""Wall Street"" plays like Shakespeare compared to this unnecessary sequel.

There really isn't a compelling story to tell in this movie. It's a revenge story with no bite.  It's an economic cautionary tale that bores the viewer instead of grabbing him by the throat.

Director Oliver Stone couldn't help but to give a few winks to his original ""Wall Street"" film by bringing back a couple of characters from that film for cameo appearances in this one. I suppose it was meant to be sort of a cute gift for the audience but it really doesn't do anything but distract from the present storyline, uninvolving though it may be.

Shia LeBoeuf is sorely miscast here -- he doesn't have the masculine heft to look like anything other than a high-school kid wearing a grown-up's clothes.  Attempts to ""butch him up"" -- such as the scenes where he confronts a business rival, tears through the countryside on a motorcycle, or tries to play the romantic lead against co-star Carey Mulligan -- fall flat.  They aren't as laughably absurd as when Steven Spielberg dressed him up to emulate Marlon Brando in ""The Wild One"" for his introductory moment in the last ""Indiana Jones"" film, but it comes dangerously close.

In a nod towards the song by Talking Heads that played in ""Wall Street"" (and repeats here), Oliver Stone enlisted Talking Heads singer David Byrne to contribute a handful of songs for this movie, and Stone manages to shoehorn about a half-dozen of them into this film in very awkward fashion.  Stone also manages to sneak in some product placement for Heineken Beer in equally unsubtle fashion.

Many of the background extras know they are on camera and over-act.  And during a scene at a fancy dinner and ball the extras are all dancing in different rhythm and in an inappropriate style to a waltz (the music for which was probably added in post-production:  it is doubtful that any music was played back for the extras during the actual shooting of the scene).

Remember Gordon Gekko's ""Greed is good"" speech from the first film?  He gets another speech in this film too, and he plays it to a roomful of college students who laugh and applaud a little too enthusiastically at moments that don't merit that kind of response.  Chalk that up to Stone and/or the editor trying to ""juice up"" an otherwise uninspiring and unmemorable scene.  [And if I can be a little picky about that ""Greed is good"" speech from the 1987 film:  the original line was ""Greed, for lack of a better word, is good"".  TECHNICALLY, it should have been ""Greed is, for lack of a better word, good.""  Note the different placement of the word ""is"".  If the descriptive qualifier phrase ""for lack of a better word"" is placed after the word ""greed"" and before the verb, then the phrase is -- syntax-wse -- referring to the word ""greed""  (as in he used the word ""greed"" because he lacked for a better word).  By moving that phrase AFTER the word ""is"", it then is in reference to the word ""good"", as was the intended meaning.  The whole point of that oft-quoted line is that Gekko was indicating that he deemed greed to be ""good"" because he lacked for a more appropriate word than ""good"" to describe greed.]

Back to the sequel:

Oliver Stone has often employed some visual playfulness in both his camerawork and design.  The first third or half of the film features a lot of those attention-seeking visual histrionics, then he backs off of it for most of the rest of the film, then tosses one or two more in near the end.  Because of that inconsistency of style, it draws even more attention to itself.  It's as if he didn't have a coherent or consistent tone in mind for the film's look.  And when the film briefly switches locales to Zurich, the insert title on the screen shows ""Zurich, Switzerland"".  Oh, THAT Zurich!  And late in the film the location switches to London, and we are treated to a shot of the London Bridge and an insert title that says ""London, England"".  Oh, THAT London!  Thanks for the geography tutorial, Oliver.  And by the way, I really AM smarter than a fifth-grader:  I could have figured out Switzerland and England all by myself, thank you.

The film also features one of the most overused and eye-rolling cliches in all of film -- the female lead delivering the news of her pregnancy at the most inopportune time for the baby's father to have to deal with it.  YAWN!

The film carries two storylines -- the relationship complications between the two young leads and Michael Douglas's character, and the grossly oversimplified morality tale of the unethical practices that lead to our recent economic meltdown.  Neither story is terribly interesting, despite the latter being extremely relevant to real life.

Susan Sarandon appears briefly as Shia's mom, and sports a thick regional accent that borders on parody.

As for Michael Douglas, he's looking more and more like his father Kirk now.  And you'd have to blind not to notice his obvious dentures.

This movie has a tame and uninteresting business story, a bland love story, too many moments of forced sentimentality, and Shia LeBoeuf trying unsuccessfully to be a credible movie-idol leading man.  Worst of all, NONE of the elements that made the original ""Wall Street"" a decently compelling tale of betrayal seem to work here.

Don't buy it.  Don't rent it.  Let it sink down into oblivion where it belongs.  ""Money Never Sleeps"" should be put to rest.

**  I will admit to liking one particular line of dialogue from the film:  Gordon Gekko leans across a table to whisper to a heated and crooked rival of his and says, ""If you stop telling lies about me, I'll stop telling the truth about you!""  I'll probably steal that line one day.",1321660800,4,5773,4.687872763419483

4333624,1,B004DMIIPK,"Anyone who went to see this movie was treated to the cinematic equivalent of a Ponzi scheme. They were deceived by the movie poster and by the previews, which conveyed a very different plot.

The poster makes it look like the movie is about Gordon Gekko mentoring another young stock broker, but it's not. It's about Shia Labeouf's character trying to patch things up between Gekko and his estranged daughter, who happens to be Labeouf's girlfriend.

It seems like most mainstream films have romantic sub-plots, either to humanize the characters so that when tragedy strikes the audience will feel sympathy for them, or to give women in the audience a bone to chew on. Here Wall Street is the sub-plot and the drama between Labeouf, his girlfriend and Gekko takes center stage.

How could a man in a Wall Street occupation even have time for a girlfriend? Most Wall Street employees work 60+ hours a week, including weekends. These aren't 9-to-5 jobs. And why doesn't Labeouf ever look exhausted for that matter? When he's talking to his homely girlfriend, he appears fresh and composed.

The film attempts to show the tender side of Gordon Gekko, but that is not what made him a great character. He was interesting as a ruthless speculator, gathering inside information and espousing his ""greed is good"" philosophy. In this movie he is sappy, weird and preachy.

Perhaps not a word out of place with excellent cinematography garnished with just a dash of Special Effects, this is Stone's best lesson in economics and the 'systemic' deadly sins of avarice and gluttony and perhaps his best film over time.

The plot concerns the later life of Gordon Gekko, and his relationship with LeBoeuf as (gasp) a young trader with something Gekko wants and needs.  The backdrop is the banking bailout of late 2008 with Josh Brolin as a sleazy but powerful banker serving as the antagonist.

4333629,3,B004DMIIPK,"More polished, more stylish, more melodramatic.. and yet somehow never as sharp and biting as the original, this is at once entertaining, enjoyable, and a little disappointing.  The original Wall Street has dated somewhat since its 80's release - go watch it now, and you will more likely be amazed at the hair styles and synth-y soundtrack than the story.  But it was a real zeitgeist movie, doing what Stone can do best - using a storyline in a movie to hold a mirror up to America, even if the angle is not the most flattering one.  This time round though, the edge is gone - the heat of the satire has somehow gone off the boil.  Don't get me wrong, I still found this a good movie and entertaining, but it's more in a melodrama mould than the expose of Stone's former glories.
The movie is set in 2008.  Gecko has been released from prison, aged, but impassive enough for us to find it difficult to tell if the experience mellowed him, or embittered him.  Into his life walks Shia Lebeouf, involved in a relationship with his estranged daughter.  Amid the backdrop of one of the most significant year in decades for Wall Street, we follow the relationships of these three, and a few significant others.  Plenty to enjoy on display - Leboeuf puts in a surprisingly decent performance, and age hasn't dulled the glint in Douglas eye.. there is still a tangible presence when he's on centre stage.  Stone has accumulated some other surprising talents too.. Susan Sarandon, Eli Wallach amongst others.. but they exist roles that are entirely dispensible from a story point of view.  Sarandon in particular has a well played role as Laboeuf's mother, which nonetheless does nothing except slow the pace of the movie down.  Perhaps the biggest star then, after Douglas, is Stone himself.  Not in his on screen cameo, but as the director... the film is full of interesting stylistic flourishes and images which make the movie a visual treat.  Alas, when you are noticing director's tricks and enjoying the soundtrack, perhaps it's a good indication the story is not as punchy as it thinks it is.

The movie is lit as if Stone wanted to film a romantic comedy. I still don't understand LaBeouf's appeal. He comes across as a weasel. Winnie Gekko is just awful and the scenes between them seem like an episode of 90210.

At least with the first WS, we loved the characters: Budd Fox, Carl Fox (Bud's Dad), Lou Manheim,  Sir Larry Wildman, and even the evil Mr. Lynch and slippery Marvin the Mind-Reader connected with the audience. IN WS:MNS there is no connection between the characters who are just thin and whose dialogue is poorly scripted.

Brolin is wasted here. Richard Gere, Harrison Ford, Andy Garcia, or any bigger-older Hollywood heavyweight would have been a better choice to beef up this dull script. And what's with the LED lighting and all the special effects? Just awful and completely unnecessary.

The only redeeming quality is Douglas as Gekko, who is fun to watch until the end of the movie. Just when you think the movie may be worth remembering, Stone really destroys this movie with a completely unbelievable (un watchable) reunion with Gekko's daughter and an even worse final rooftop scene which is simply AWFUL.

4333640,3,B004DMIIPK,"Most people that I know regard the original `Wall Street' as `not as good as I remembered it', if they remembered it fondly at all.  In fact, it took me nearly four tries to actually get through the entire film.  It bordered on boring and redundant and the pacing was terrible.  Of course, Michael Douglas's portrayal of greedy corporate shark Gordon Gekko is iconic and his `signature performance', so there is always that.  This reboot, `Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps' doesn't do a whole lot to improve on the original, but it is an improvement if we are going to be completely honest.  It has the same elements of greed and corruption but it also has familiar tensions thanks to the introduction of Gordon's daughter Winnie and her overachieving fianc&eacute;e who is just dying to get inside her father's world.  Some of the film can come across very cheesy and underdeveloped (Gekko's motivational speech for instance has no substance and felt like a `made for TV' moment) and some of the character development came across roughly though out (like that symbolic yet oddly underdeveloped motorcycle race).  Still, there are some aspects of this film that really work, like Carey Mulligan.  My god, she continues to be like the greatest thing in every film she's in.  She develops her character marvelously, and exhibits real flesh and bones.  Douglas rehashes a lot with an unbelievable tone, but he's Michael Douglas so all is forgiven.  The script is the real culprit here, for it just doesn't have a lot of weight.  It tries hard to be relevant and poignant, but in doing so it becomes almost too real to feel exciting.  There are segments that feel like newsreels and others that feel like poorly realized interpretations of `actual events'.  The film looks fresh though, and the pacing here is a true lifesaver.  I wouldn't ignore this completely, especially if you are a fan of the original or of the cast and director, but don't expect it to be outstanding because it isn't.",1303776000,,1987,4.820058997050148

The original Wall Street (1987) was one of the best films of the 80s. I was surprised to see a sequel after 23 years. Reviews were mostly negative and so I tempered my expectations, but I wanted to revisit this world even if just to eliminate the movie from my potential wish list.

I was pleasantly surprised.

Frank Langella didn't have a big role as Louis Zabel, but it was an important one and set the scene well. Jake Moore (LaBeouf) plays a successful young broker who is dating Winnie Gekko (Mulligan). She's no longer in contact with her father (Gordon) since he was released from prison. Moore seems to admire Gordon Gekko and tries to patch up the father-daughter relationship.

The stock market is facing hard times and many firms are going out of business. The heart of the story revolves around Moore's quest to
avenge the death of his former boss and mentor Zabel by working for the billionaire (Brolin) who was largely responsible for the events leading to his suicide.

A secondary story involves Gordon Gekko and his attempts to connect with his daughter while striving to establish himself on Wall Street despite not having any money.

It's not as good as the original, but I am glad I saw it. Stone used some interesting choices to depict the business being done on Wall Street and it worked for me.

The presentation was very good; much better than the dismal 1987 Blu-ray. PQ was strong throughout and deserves a 4.5/5. I can heartily recommend this presentation.",1303689600,,1917,5.018927444794953

Oliver Stone starts here with a decent idea, but the film lacks the style and conviction that made the original so great(in its time). There is too much time spent revisiting the past with an awkward cameo by Charlie Sheen and regurgitated dialogue from the first film. The uninspired script makes this one tedious for the most part and it makes this film seem too long. Even Gekko's speech seems like a flighty montage of the original.

The acting was bad the storyline even worst so I'm not sure what Oliver Stone was thinking when making this film.

My opinion is that he was better off not doing this sequel and leaving his mark as creating the best trading movie of all-time. Now he can go down in history as creating the best and now the worst trading films of all-time.

4333650,1,B004DMIIPK,"Sometimes a movie comes along that gets mixed reviews and it may be due to something controversial or some other reason.  Seeing all the bad reviews for this movie I had held off seeing it.  I am a great fan of almost all the stars especially Michael Douglas and Shia LaBeouf.  I finally thought how bad can it really be and ordered it on demand on cable.  I am writing this review to warn everyone - with this movie it honestly is not a matter of opinion, the movie is just plain terrible.  I don't get how people are going overboard criticizing the acting for there is very little for any of the actors to do.  I blame this disaster on Oliver Stone and him alone.  He is obviously trying to make a statement on money, its business etc.  No point is made and there is no story.  All the actors walk through each scene like zombies for the entire script is ridiculous.  There is no emotion for the acrtors to grasp onto.  The scenes where tears are shown are laughable for they are so poorly written and directed.  With this movie there is no beginning, middle or end.

I really want to know what power Oliver Stone used to convince all these A list actors to participate in this terrible film.  He has created and directed a true mess.

I very rarely write such negative reviews but I must be honest and feel people considering watching this film or even God forbid purchasing it should be warned.  It is not being ridiculed for it is a bad sequel but for the mere fact that it is a bad film.  Liking the actors is not enough to get through it.  Avoid at all cost.",1299888000,37,1686,4.209375

4333652,3,B004DMIIPK,"While it's safe to say Wall Street is a classic film, I think it's also a good bet the sequel won't ever be viewed in the same light 20 years from now, unfortunately. I'm not saying it's a bad film in general terms. It just doesn't live up to the original and lacks some creativity.

The thing I came away from Money Never Sleeps thinking was that it lacked the edge of the original. Shia Labeouf does not have anywhere near the same kind of screen presence as Charlie Sheen did (Bud Fox makes a brief appearance in the sequel, by the way), leaving the direct inter-personal conflicts which feature in the story - verbal as they may be - less impactful. And the lack of one strong antagonist character (Michael Douglas's Gordon Gekko sometimes is one, sometimes isn't) tends to diffuse the tension.

In terms of the story, if you've read much about the history of the financial crisis - especially On the Brink, by Hank Paulson - you will see a very strong similarity in the early parts of Money Never Sleeps. There's also a firm that is portrayed very much in the way Goldman Sachs was portrayed in recent years. To top it all off, Gekko has very John Paulson-like success in the markets.

I do think the new film does a pretty good job reflecting how information moves around these days. Blogs, instant messaging, and the like feature along side the traditional phone and in-person interaction. Overall, though, I'd give it a middling rating. Gekko's semi-reformed character is the only one that's really interesting and the story is flat and somewhat disjointed.",1299456000,,1565,4.663043478260869
4333653,3,B004DMIIPK,"It has been over 20 years since director Oliver Stone's original hit ""Wall Street"" garnered actor Michael Douglas an Academy Award win and made the phrase ""Greed is good"" a pop culture staple. In late 2010, Oliver Stone reunited with Michael Douglas to give fans of the original film what they've been waiting to see for years... a sequel.

""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps"" begins as Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) is finally released from prison for insider trading. During his time away from the outside world, Gordon's daughter, Winnie (Carey Mulligan), has severed all ties to her illustrious father and attempted to live her life free from his shadow. By her side is her fianc, Jake (Shia LaBeouf), himself a Wall Street trader, who believes that perhaps the best thing for Winnie is to reconnect with her father. With so much time lost, Gordon sets his mind to bonding with his daughter, but also reclaiming the vast financial empire that was once his to rule, no matter the cost.

So, after nearly 25 years have gone by as ardent fans have waited for the continuing story of Gordon Gekko; was this particular sequel worth the wait or even necessary for that matter? If you ask me, I would have to say, ""Not at all.""

""Why,"" you ask? Well, there are several reasons that I felt this movie wasn't worth the wait, and I shall get to those in a moment. As for the second part of the question, that I can answer right now.

Simply put, even if this film had been strong enough to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with its predecessor, a task which could have been accomplished, it still would have been unnecessary.

Reason being, the story of Gordon Gekko was finished when he was sentenced to prison. The original movie gave the audience plenty of insight into his character, and personally, there didn't seem to be anything further to explore. This was a sequel made for the sole purpose of cashing in on the still surprisingly strong popularity of this villainous Wall Street tycoon and the current financial crisis.

As for what made the movie not worth the wait; for starters, the story written by Allan Loeb (""21"") and Stephen Schiff (""True Crime"") is surprisingly uncomplicated, completely derivative, and utterly weak.

First off, an uncomplicated story isn't necessarily a bad thing. In some cases there are movies that could have been incredible had the writer and/or director reined in the proceedings a bit more. However, when you compare the richness, the detail, and multiple layers inherent in the original ""Wall Street""; well, a much simpler story seems almost insulting by comparison.

Then there is the primary driving force behind this film's plot...revenge. While not a bad motivator for character's within a story, it can result in some undue predictability seeping into the mix. Sadly, this proved to be the case here, because it seemed as if every single major player in the film (aside from Winnie) had some vengeance kick they were on for one reason or another. After a while, this overuse of one single theme began to make almost every aspect of this film, from the characters to the dialogue to the story itself, feel extremely uninspired.

Also, we have the complete lack of subtlety on behalf of director Oliver Stone. For a man as experienced in the art of filmmaking, one would have thought that he would have figured out how to be subtle. But, one would be wrong. This shortcoming is most prominently featured in his use of kids playing with bubbles to symbolize all of the ""bubbles"" (or trends) that occur in the stock market.

Symbolism can be a useful and extremely helpful dramatic tool when properly utilized. However, when the same symbolism is used repeatedly within the same movie it moves beyond being a creative visual aide to being annoyingly clichd and above all, insulting to the viewer.

By the final use of bubbles in the movie, I really felt like Oliver Stone thought his audience would be too weak-minded to fully grasp what he was trying to convey within the story; hence, the need for such blatantly obvious visual aides. Well, I for one understood perfectly what the story was talking about (without the aides, I might add), and found the over-used symbolism to be unnecessary and ultimately patronizing.

Another area in which the story felt weak was in its inclusion of the 2008 market crash. Many people, myself included, figured Oliver Stone would have used this movie as an attempt to analyze/attack Wall Street and the banking industry after the collapse of 2008. After all, when has Oliver passed up an opportunity (aside from ""World Trade Center"") to inject his own politics and theories into a film?

However, nothing of the sort ever really occurs. Surprisingly, Oliver Stone never really delves into the details surrounding the market crash. Basically, the whole fiasco was dealt with in a manner befitting a fairly minor plot point in the movie.

Even from my perspective as a guy who grows tired of Oliver's political and conspiratorial soapboxes found in many of his films; I expected more from such a provocative director. In this regard, the movie felt lazy and uninterested in actually dealing with any of the serious issues surrounding its plot.

Despite the issues that plagued this film's story, some members of this talented cast did their level best to elevate the movie beyond its meager standing. The two headliners for the film were the increasingly popular Shia LaBeouf (""Transformers"") and returning star Michael Douglas.

Actor Shia LaBeouf delivers a solid performance as Jake, a young up-and-comer on Wall Street and potential protg of Gordon Gekko. Shia proves that he is more than capable of handling strictly dramatic material and that he doesn't always need to be delivering witty zingers amidst giant talking robots.

Veteran actor Michael Douglas is perfectly conniving and underhanded, yet charismatic as ever in the role of Gordon Gekko. Despite the over twenty year sabbatical from this character, Michael brings Gordon back without missing a beat and delivers another great performance. It's just too bad that this return appearance had to occur in such a misfire of a sequel.

Speaking of misfires what was the point of Charlie Sheen's useless cameo? I understand that Oliver wanted to let fans see what Bud Fox was doing these days, but couldn't his appearance have felt a little less shoe-horned in? Not to mention, the cameo did nothing to really serve the story other than provide a moment of awkwardness for Gordon. In fact, it just further cemented the pointless nature of this sequel.

Anyway, back to the regular cast for this film. Actress Carey Mulligan (""An Education"") was good in the role of Gordon's estranged daughter, Winnie. My only complaint for her was that she wasn't really given all that much to do other than throw a few mini fits every time she caught a glimpse of her father (understandable given their history) or cry about everything. She's a talented actress for sure, but this role was wasted on her.

Lastly, in the remaining supporting roles are Josh Brolin (""No Country for Old Men"") and Frank Langella (""Superman Returns""). Josh had to have been pleased to work on this film, or any film for that matter with some semblance of a cohesive story, after the ""Jonah Hex"" debacle. Even so, his character here is nothing more than your standard shady political type, and Brolin never really commits enough to the role to improve upon it.

As for Frank Langella, his role as Jake's mentor/father figure was essentially an over-glorified cameo appearance. Certainly his character holds significant influence over Jake for the entire movie, but Frank was not given all that much to do in front of the camera. Just like Carey Mulligan, Frank was just another bit of wasted casting in the film and further proof of the vast amount of potential that this movie squandered in the end.

In closing, after more than twenty years of fans waiting patiently had finally paid off, the end result was barely an average movie that is nowhere near as entertaining or engaging as its predecessor.

Unfortunately, I was disappointed by it largely because the movie couldn't decide what it wanted to focus on: was it Gecko's redemption, was it Jake Moore trying to create his own legacy, or did it want to center on the familial issues? While I usually don't mind following multiple plots in a movie, these plots felt forced together.

I felt the acting was ok, overall.  Douglas doesn't miss a beat stepping back into the role of Gecko, and Frank Langella does a nice job in a small role.  Shia LeBouf was ok-I don't think he detracted from the movie, but he didn't add anything to it.  Carey Mulligan, on the other hand did not do well as Gecko's daugther, although she wasn't given much to work with from the script.  Susan Sarandon's cameo was pointless, although I did enjoy Charlie Sheen's short cameo.  Josh Brolin was miscast as the money baron that Jake Moore and Gecko try to take down.

It's an ok and somewhat entertaining movie. I was definitely disappointed though, because Wall Street 2 definitely missed an opportunity to make a statement in the wake of the subprime meltdown.",1298678400,,1248,4.640909090909091

4333661,3,B004DMIIPK,"Those who expect an insightful look at Wall Street and the recent stock market crash will be disappointed at Oliver Stone's ""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps,"" sequel to ""Wall Street"" made in 1987. But I know this is not a documentary, and it doesn't have to be one. What is really disappointing to me is the film could have been a more riveting drama with one very interesting anti-hero Gordon Gekko.

Shia LaBeouf is Jacob Moore, ace trader working for a major investment banks. His girlfriend Winnie (Carey Mulligan) is a daughter of Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas), released from jail back in 2001. Despite the warning from Winnie, after listening to Gordon's speech at his lecture, Jacob is instantly attracted to the disgraced former Wall Street banker, who once told the world ""Greed is good"" (and now wrote a book ""Is Greed Good?"")

The film's complicated story also Bretton James (Josh Brolin), a ruthless head of an investment bank, and Louis Zabel (Frank Langella), head of Keller Zabel Investments Jacob currently works for. Charlie Sheen briefly appears as Bud Fox, the main character of the original ""Wall Street.""

As you know, Gordon Gekko is the role for which the star Michael Douglas won Oscar about 24 years ago, and in the sequel Douglas is quite good as charismatic and mysterious father/mentor-like figure to Shia LaBeouf's would-be son-in-law/protg. This is the most intriguing aspect of ""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps,"" with Shia LaBeouf's character similar to the role played by Charlie Sheen in the original, but it is eventually sidelined by the less convincing story about the romance and even less convincing plotline about the nuclear fusion project. And there is another subplot about Jacob's mother (played by Susan Sarandon), a real-estate agent who needs money badly.

I know making a film about the still on-going financial crisis is too difficult a task for anyone to deal with (especially when you have to do it without losing entertainment value), but after watching the film, I still don't know what ""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps"" really wants to say. So many things are going on, but not many of them are really interesting or immediate, and some plotlines are treated rather heavy-handedly with clichd narrative elements. The film is a mixed bag, overall entertaining with some unexpected turns of events and ultimately predictable moments.",1298419200,,2385,5.076530612244898
4333662,2,B004DMIIPK,"The Original ""Wall Street"" movie was excellent - and in all likelihood it will take it's place among the Classics.  That's all the more reason why this sequel is so disappointing to me.  I'd hate to think Oliver Stone is losing his touch, so I'll chalk this puppy up to a rare mistake.

The script falters, and is indeed, immature when considering the sophistication of the subject matter undertaken.  Both of the young actors (the up-and-coming new-age trader, and his fiancee', Gordon Gecco's daugher)left a lot to be desired in their character artistry.  Michael Douglas, one of my favorites, appeared too tired to care about his impact one way or the other; some of the dialogue reminded me of a flimsy soap opera segment rather than the tale of a displaced, ruthless master manipulator returning to the fold, if not the floor.

I was expecting much more from this film and it could have been delivered; it certainly had the potential given all that has happened in the markets since the original ""Wall Street"" was released.  I'm not sure what happened, but I couldn't make enough excuses for it to give it more than two stars.

I also enjoyed the competing philosophical outlooks, which was similar to the first film.  On the most basic level, this movie might seem somewhat mundane.  To me, however, the better films are ones that make the viewer think, or evaluate life, love, money, philosophy, expectations, etc.  I think Money Never Sleeps definately falls into this category.  The movie challenges the viewer, but doesn't necessarily give any secrets away.  It's kind of like life.  We often get out of it, what we are willing and able to put into it.

On a more superficial note, the cinematography is superb.  I especially enjoyed the shots of New York City, which really captured the beauty and power of the city.  The acting is also great, with fine performances given by all.",1298073600,2,936,4.974193548387097

It is simply terrible,",1297987200,3,349,4.0
4333666,4,B004DMIIPK,"Oliver Stone's films are normally heavy going, humourless and preachy; he likes to smash the audience over the head with his moralising and in ""JFK"" he got almost everything factually wrong. However, I always appreciated the original 1987 ""Wall Street"" for its sharp screenplay, superlative acting and editing and morally astute ""greed-is-NOT-good"" message. It's fair to say that Michael Douglas's devastating performance as Gordon Gekko defined the original film's core in personifying the selfish, cold, win-at-all-costs immorality of the long-gone 1980s.

So 23 years on, what of this belated sequel, ""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps""? Well, Stone is now a better film-maker, matured and wiser. He has crafted a near-excellent lesson in morality attacking this time not the activities of a few rogue traders, but the systemic corruption and imbalances inherent in a banking system with little external oversight or realistic internal managerial prudence which allows for continued out-of-control borrowing, leverage and debt-trading on insubstantial property assets on a truly galactic scale, to the point where it cracks and the global economy is almost brought to its knees. These guys can, at the end of the day, virtually dictate that government steps in to save them from going under because the consequences of failing to shore up the financial system are too awful to contemplate: social and economic meltdown, the ""end of the world.""

Douglas resurrects his memorable role as Gordon Gekko in a second career-landmark performance, if anything even sharper than in the 1987 film. He has some killer lines (""If you stop telling lies about me, I'll stop telling the truth about you"" and ""Hey! If someone were to take out this building right now, there'd be no-one left to rule the world!"" stand out in memory). Released from jail after eight years, having lost his son to suicide following psychiatric breakdown he has searched his troubled soul and seems reformed. Daughter Winnie (played tearfully in a so-so performance by Carey Mulligan) is doing OK with fianc stockbroker Jake Moore (played well by Shia LaBeouf, though as an actor he possibly lacks the gravitas the role calls for). Winnie will have nothing to do with newly-released and rehabilitated Pop, distrusts him and hates him for tearing the family apart, causing her brother's death and tarnishing her name. It's up to Jake to finally reunite them in (a rather formulaic Hollywood scene of) tearful forgiveness, though the journey is a rocky road and takes time.

Having rediscovered his moral compass behind bars, Gordon has a new book published to coincide with his release. The book exposes the house of cards which is the western financial system, built on debt and promise-to-pay-eventually and motivated by greed whilst backed by insufficient assets. Gordon's book proves prophetic as the global credit crunch unfolds through 2007 and 2008. A killer scene where Gordon gives a presentation to several hundred finance students and players in a lecture hall, complete with black humour and devastating one-liners, may be destined to become one of cinema's most iconic moments. ""You're the NINJA generation"", he quips, ""No Income, No Job or Assets.""

Without giving too much of the plot away, one of the main storylines is the engineered collapse of Lehman Bros - disguised in the film under another name as Jake's employer - and Jake's quest for revenge against the instigators with the covert assistance of Gordon. A new villain, Master-of-the-Universe Bretton James (played to suitably demonic effect by Josh Brolin), who of course Jake gets real close to, takes centre stage as The Bad Guy. The amorality of the game everyone is forced to play in the banking and stock-trading world is nailed to a ""T"" with some masterful observations by Stone. A little heavy-handed at times he may be, but he shows you the way it is, no holds barred. The screenplay is a devastating critique, fast-paced and tightly scripted and holds the attention mostly, though it's not exactly clich-free.

Where the film falls short is in the family-relationship and personal redemption department, which is almost classic Hollywood and doesn't really come off as well as the hard-hitting message about the financial system. It's just OK, but not altogether convincing. Stone manages to incorporate his alternative green-energy obsessions (in this case, hi-tech fusion) as the neglected Cinderella of big financial investment and there is, at a personal level, a happy ending of sorts for the three main characters. No-one comes out smelling of roses, but sure enough, Gordon is in the end redeemed.

David Byrne's excellent music provides a quality soundtrack perfect for the film's mood. The supporting cast is good, especially Susan Sarandon as Jake's mother whose character has forsaken her career as a nurse (i.e. someone performing a job of real social value who ""makes a difference"") in order to become a real-estate speculator and make money in the casino economy until everything goes pear-shaped for her and she loses it all (go on, Oliver, ram your morality message home some more, why don't you?). The plot is fast-paced and convoluted, so you need to pay attention. Is it worth seeing? Yes, it is. It's a serious film and a good one, if not quite a great one.

Douglas, LeBeouf and the girl all pulled it off. The story centers around the crash of '08 and who's to blame. Again Stone makes big business the prime culprit, but he does show government's role in the corrupt corporatist cronyism that went on also, to his credit.

I enjoyed the setting amongst the stock crash of 2008. Yes, the back room bank machinations that are pinpointed as the cause of the crash are simplistic, but as we've learned more about what happened during that time since then, it's also true that this version is not entirely off-track.

Anyway, the story has some unexpected moments, and the for the most is fairly entertaining.  Shia is, once again, a terrible cast - simply does not come across as any sort of Wall Street success.  Particularly in the fact that he basically has a ""make believe"" job in the movie, one that doesn't exist in the context with which he represents it.

The other thing I hated about this movie was the social commentary (voiced frequently by the characters). Normally, I like in that in the movie, but in this case it didn't work at all because the actual movie didn't really support the commentary. That is, the movie was too weak to support or bolster the comments the characters were making. It seemed very incongruous.

There is much wit and wisdom in the one-liners.  Even if they sound like fortune cookie ""Confucious says..."" cliches.

There are many fresh cinematographic views of Manhattan.  The vertical oblique shot of the iconic 55 Wall Street building was an unusual aspect of the building.  This was the building where the Great Depression of 1929 started: it was the premises of the New York City Bank, now Citibank.  The apartments within had high profile marketing in Singapore last year: get to be neighbours with Naomi Campbell, Bruce Willis, Harvey Weinstein, Mickey Rourke, and other celebs in what is now the Cipriani Building.

Shia LaBeouf speaking in Chinese was comically weird.  For a movie based on real events, the spoken Chinese sounded bizarre.  There are dialect coaches for actors for regional accents in the USA, so why not for Chinese.  When this movie is expected to be seen by Chinese around the world, the absence of proper pronunciation of Chinese is a huge oversight.

Conversely, the Chinese executive patronising the Yanks in melodramatic Charlie Chan English had me in stitches.  Chinese or any foreigner working at the level of billion dollar deals speak impeccable English these days - and they are likely to be American Ivy League graduates as well.

Tonal inflections change the meaning of spoken Chinese words.  Take ""pi fang"" for example.  Different tones can change the context from ""I have come with three examples for you"" to ""I have come to fart three times for you"".  Hollywood has yet to make such a gaffe.  Lack of proper coaching for Chinese is false economy, particularly for a movie as fine as this one.

Michael Douglas says maybe only 75 people in the world understand what CDO, CMO, SIV, ABS mean. No tonal inflections needed for Collateralised Debt Obligations, Collateralised Mortgage Obligations, Structured Investment Vehicles, Asset Backed Securities.  Welcome to the cognoscenti.

Ignore the critics who panned this movie.  Demanding perfection for every movie is the unrealistic expectation of critics, and their opinions often mislead those of us who merely wish to be entertained.

Comments about the sequel not measuring up to the original are trite and stating the obvious.  (for a lot worse, think Miss Congeniality 2, Behind Enemy Lines 2, Highlander 2, Legally Blonde 2, Karate Kid 2, Dirty Dancing 2, Speed 2, Gone with the Wind 2 aka Scarlett, Basic Instinct 2 and other bombs)

Audiences are intelligent enough to distinguish gravitas from schmaltz.  If Michael Douglas can go on to do a Wall Street series, like Rocky, Indiana Jones or Star Wars, I am sure there will be a following.  Let the box office and dvd sales, not critics, decide.

Michael Douglas' ""If you stop telling lies about me, I will stop telling the truth about you"" is actually an Adlai Stevenson 1952 quote.

Whoever chose the soundtrack, should check with the person who selected the music for the Sopranos tv series just as an example.

If find both nicely done, but I do not have a clue what they are talking about! I do not know anything about Wall Street and Stocks. So the movies are now in my dvd collection kinda as I will put both to the side where my other dvds are which I am not going to watch again.

To me I find the movie Wallstreet with Shia too boring to watch it again as I do not really understand what they talk about.
Of course it is about money and stocks and also a bit about the relation between father and daughter and her soon to become husband, but still the movie did not catch my attention at all.

Nice touch of Charlie Sheen to drop by in the movie again :-)  That was kinda nice to see.

Just when we all want to send him to jail again for stealing funds from his daughter, we hear him explain that yes he did try to use her, yes he is a creep, but she's all he's got so even though I've screwed you (again), let's somehow try to work this out.  We see father and daughter getting warmer and fuzzier toward each other as the closing credits are about to roll, but I was left wondering what he was going to do to her next.

I loved the scene in which Gordon runs into a former high-powered colleague after getting out of jail and the man didn't have a clue who Gecko was.  How quickly they forget.  Of course, these empty greed-machines don't relate to people, they only care about the portfolio the person has and how they can grab a piece of it for themselves.

  All in all, I found the pace slower than the first flick, the plot contrived and thinner, with far less punch, and not nearly as memorable as the first.  It was good to see Charlie Sheen again, in a cameo, sneering at Gordon at a party.  But overall, it runs to my mind as an attempt to wring a few more bucks out of the Wall Street franchise, timed perfectly to appeal to all of us who might be just-a-little annoyed at what those creeps did to our economy in 2008...",1295136000,,1565,4.1395348837209305

Michael Douglas was reportedly gravely ill when he reprised his most memorable role as Gekko, a fiction so perfect that a whole generation of greedy B-school grads thought he was true history.

But ""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps"" has bottom line deficits also, principal among them being Shia LaBeouf in the role of Jake, the ethically floundering boyfriend of Winnie (Carey Mulligan), who happens to be the alienated daughter of Gekko. Here's where we need Lloyd Bentsen's famous quip: ""Listen, Jake, I knew Charlie Sheen, and you're no Charlie Sheen."" LaBeouf is painful; there's no way on earth this wimp can appear plausible to Winnie Gekko as a mate or to her invincibly rapacious father as a proteg.

The bigger deficit, however, is that Oliver Stone wants his film to be box-office. Or so it seems, which would imply that he's finally succumbed to greed himself. Or should we assume that the film is postmodernist self-reference? It's a 'hostile' takeover, a razor-keen satire of the Wall Street culture that is still dazzling/blinding America, packaged like a bad mortgage inside a feel-good love story. Did Milton let Lucifer get to Heaven after all? Did Moby Dick spit Ahab up on Tahiti? Gordon Gekko having a change of heart, he who has no heart, after watching the ultrasound of a fetus? Gimme a break!

But, as I said, there are assets. There's a wealth of truth in Gekko's hypocrisy, explicit in his sermons to Jake and others, denouncing the ""game"" of getting rich. And it's the very truth that Oliver Stone wants Americans to hear, even if he needs to sugarcoat it in yuppy-puppy love. Here's a riddle -- mine, not Stone's:

The proceedings are further marred by the stunning nonentity known as Shia LaBeouf, who brings nothing to the party.

This film will be twice as entertaining for those who know investing, especially those who've worked on the Street and/or been traders, but those who haven't may find its various flaws debilitating. Stone can't be faulted for not putting his heart into this WS2, but he could have leaned on his editor and writers a little harder. The script has some sweet moments but also crams every investment chestnut in there that it can; I'm surprised they didn't end up saying, ""Buy low, sell high is the secret"", or have a character named Livermore. But those who haven't heard these maxims a thousand times will certainly enjoy the truths they contain, just as those who know the ego-driven world of Wall Street and Goldman Sachs will recognize many things here. Certainly former Lehman Brothers employees will find it all a bit too familiar.

Sadly, as a movie it's a bit slipshod. Douglas is good again as Gekko, but writer Schiff gives him too many long speeches telling us what went wrong in the subprime debacle, without really making the information an integral part of the plot. That speechifying hurts, mainly because the speeches are so accurate and one wishes they'd been couched more thoroughly and believably. Langella looks scary these days, and does a nice job, as do most of the cast, though Shia is a bit lightweight in a number of ways. He's passable, but his part could have been knocked out of the park by a better choice.

The main issue here is the plot, which has a few real holes, and makes little sense in terms of sending a message, and a message we all need to grok real fast at that. [Spoilers] Gekko steals 100 million from his daughter and turns it into a billion, then is some kind of nice guy for giving back the stolen seed capital? His daughter is so thinly drawn as to be gossamer, and the scenes between her and the others only really work when Douglas is around; he's acquired a fair bit of gravitas and blows the kids away. The veterans here hold their own, however, with Brolin doing a very nice turn, and his line, ""More!"" is perhaps the linchpin here. But some of the scenes in the Fed room miss a huge chance to show so much more of what really went on when our tax dollars were used to bail out the people who steal most of them anyhow. And the whole grandkid/family yearning from Gekko thing just doesn't feel authentic; chop it out and this film would have been lean and tight.

Not as much fun as the first film, and a lot preachier, Wall Street is nonetheless a necessary cautionary tale from one of our few filmmakers with a real sense of how ugly things have become, and are likely to get again soon, as too few of the derivatives regulations have really been changed. Stone shot this nicely---it looks very good---but should have cut it much shorter, laid off the standard love story aspects, and really slammed Goldman Sachs to the ground, as they so richly deserve. They will soon bankrupt this country, along with our never-ending wars (which GS/the Street also does very well from), and while Stone ultimately says the right things here, the film lacks the edge it could have had.",1294790400,,3137,4.566607460035524

The first film depicted a Wall Street in a different time, a time when boutiques and KKR type firms made up a larger portion of what went down on the Street. The current film does have some great quotes by Douglas. There is no denying that. And some representations in the movie are entertaining. But the entire concept of a bank is completely missed. Given that regulators missed it, perhaps it is not surprising that Stone and the film's producers missed it too. But the first thing that struck me about the film was that Stone did little homework in preparing for the film. Even if he would have had to simplify the concept of the bank, he could have tried. Instead he skipped the banks altogether and stuck to his ridiculous concept of the small trading firm as the main culprit.

Stone had an opportunity to use a dramatic form to address America's social and economic decline, using that opportunity to focus on one of the chief causes of that decline: The dominance of the real economy by rentier capital. Stone's moment to shine was greatly enhanced by the current recession, which has taken its greatest toll in the United States on the poor, the working and the middle classes. Stone, however, ignored the national and global victims of this economy. Instead, he treated America's economic decline and the 2008 crash as elements of the mise en sc&egrave;ne he constructed for a revenge and family drama! In ""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps,"" Gordon Gekko schemes to give himself an opportunity to take the revenge on one of his old adversaries while becoming once more a big finance `player' and, most importantly for the film Stone made, winning back the heart of his estranged daughter, thus regaining the family he lost because of his enormous vanity. Oh, and Stone has Gekko regaining that family by funding innovative energy research. Gekko, as Stone portrays him, earns his redemption by choosing human goods over a pure and vain pursuit of money and power. Gordon Gekko -- a flawed renaissance man.

Stone's film depicts an always brutal Wall Street as a place in which human goods can survive if not thrive. Perhaps they can and do. The world is complex. But this abstract point cannot redeem Wall Street the place and ""Wall Street"" the sequel. To my mind, Stone's representation of Wall Street is not worthy of respect for one simple reason: He ignores the distress and utter misery which a barely restrained finance capital imposes on nearly everyone else. What does this thought mean for Stone's film? When given the chance to make an epic, Stone produced a farce. He could do so because a willful ignorance is a kind of strength one needs to overcome a flawed appreciation of an enduring reality.",1293926400,,2049,4.902017291066282
4333720,2,B004DMIIPK,Shia LaBeouf's character is too unbelievable to be able to sit through this and Emma Stone has too expressions: happy and sad.

Honestly, who wasn't Labeoufed away throughout the film (don't try stealing that term, it's copyrighted by me). With this review, however, I would like to focus on the idea of money never sleeping. The philosphical implications of such an idea have just been on my brain for months now and I just want to vent them to the rest of the world. If money never takes a brake to cool down like the rest of us, imagine the strain that this has put on money and it's ability to perform when it's needed most. Like an airline pilot with not enough sleep, perhaps money failed us in the last few years due to fatigue. This would explain many of the problems we're in the midst of. In my opinion, a stock market crash or recession is simply money saying 'Whoa, everybody, I need some rest. I'm going to go away for awhile, probably to China, to take some time off'. What I'm trying to say is money needs a break, particularly and oddly only in America for some reason, so let's give it one. Money should sleep at least as much as the rest of us.",1293840000,4,1184,4.266666666666667
4333724,5,B004DMIIPK,"Here's how I know ""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps"" is riveting--my Restless Leg Syndrome never bothered me during the film, no, not once. My attention was totally focused for the duration. Normally, during the evening I have to get up frequently and walk around to prevent wild kicking. During the film I didn't even know I had legs.

I've read a number of reviews here at Amazon of this ""Wall Street"" and do not understand the negativity. One reviewer lists a cacophony of his (often amusing) reasons for disliking the film. I thought, Gee, I saw the same film, yet I was riveted. What's more, I'm not the only one who was. Two other reviewers--Wall Streeters themselves--found the film accurate and coincidental with the truth found on Wall Street.

In response here are my reasons for labeling this Wall Street riveting:

1. Truth: Director Oliver Stone was getting at Truth. What is it? How do we find it? And, most importantly, where? Do we find it in our relationships with our significant others? With our blood relatives? At work? Just what is truth? Is truth true one day and then changes the next? Does truth change with the weather, with conditions on Wall Street?

2. Relationships: What is the basis for relationships? Do these change? If they do, why? If they don't, why not?

3. Conspiracy theory: Here Stone has his most fun. Famous for being ""edgy,"" Stone has long espoused belief in conspiracy theories (and been laughed at for same). With Wall Street he found his mother lode because there is found the biggest conspiracy of all: Bankers vs the helpless, defenseless, average American who (like me) knows hardly anything about the workings and behind-the-scene actions of Wall Streeters at various levels. Josh Brolin's character makes millions at the expense of the said American.

4. Education: Stone has delivered an attack on the specific people responsible for the devaluing of Wall Street just a couple of years ago. Those working for them were shown compassion and pardon.

5. Character: What makes good character and flawed character? Or do we wear both sides of character simultaneously and operate at various levels depending on the circumstance? Is anyone immune from flawed character?

6. The Game: Gecko (Douglas) refers to the game behind Wall Street and is, in essence, revealing addiction. Gecko and Josh Brolin's character are addicted to the rush of the game. Both insist money is not the end: it's only a by-product.

7. Punishment: Is evil punished? The actions of bad character? On the other hand, is good character rewarded? Stone emphatically answers both questions.

8. Revenge: Is it ever an acceptable motive for behavior, a question which introduces the issue of character.

My list introduces all the major themes of the film (except alternative energy which is Stone's real reason for creating the film: to promote this issue). He answers all of my questions through plot and character revelation and development. I would love to take each item and flesh it out, but I would give major spoilers. The moviegoer should find the answers for him/herself.

As for the actors, each is perfectly cast. Shia LaBoeuf is not my favorite actor, but his intensity and perfect pitch in each role is astounding. Here he absolutely floored me with each portrayal of a new emotion. How he deals with his mother and his reaction to the breakup are beautifully done. Michael Douglas portrays each level of truth mentioned in my list. I believed both versions. (Note: One reviewer questions his reaction to what he sees on the DVD. My response is to examine the potential relationship. A man wants this!) Carey Mulligan was also superb as the daughter/fiancee.

The voice-over narration about evolution, about man's appearance on this earth and the practical impossibility of it. Why was that included twice (at least)? It is in responding to this information that Stone reveals his truth. Man is both good--that impossibility happening and the creature that appears--and flawed--that impossibility happening and the creature that appears. Each character represents a different level of this truth.

For these reasons, I keep my stand: ""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps"" is a riveting film which I plan to watch again.",1293840000,7,4247,5.005673758865248
4333725,3,B004DMIIPK,"The opening scene of this film shows Gordon Gekko leaving prison after serving his time for his illegal practices. That may be the biggest fantasy, that anyone from Wall Street should be punished for their greed.

This is an entertaining film, well acted, scripted and photographed. But, as we know Wall Street is protected by the politicians, and whatever financial gains the money grabbers achieve, they get to keep. We follow one firm, where a young trader named Jake Moore played by Shia LaBeouf, works for his mentor Frank Langella, known as Louis Zabel. The firm is ripe with rumours on the street and it comes tumbling down, due to the actions of Bretton James played by Josh Brolin, who has spread rumors about the instability of the firm. A tragedy occurs and Jake takes it upon himself to show revenge for the loss of his firm. He works with Gordon Gekko, Michael Douglas, whom he met when Gordon was speechifying. As a side kick, Josh is engaged to Gordon's estranged daughter, Winnie. He keeps his relationship with Gordon from Winnie, and we know that will mistake will come home to roost. Winnie, played by Carey Mulligan is a young woman who has lost her father to prison and brother to drugs. She is unforgiving at first, but begins to melt. The relationships intertwine with shoddy trading practices, love, ambition and revenge.

A slow film getting started, but it builds to a good story that is easy to follow but not enough distaste for Wall Street is shown. We see people from the government and the White House doing what they can to help Wall Street maintain its financial stability.  I wanted more from this film.

Shila LeBoeuf, good actor, not well cast here.  James Brolin, pretty forgettable, although a good actor normally.

4333729,1,B004DMIIPK,"First: I love 1987's Wall Street.  Maybe one of my top 10 films of all time.  If I hear the opening notes of Naive Melody I want to drop what I'm doing and watch it that VERY SECOND.  Sure, it's got its own issues, most all of them contained in the Martin Sheen character, but come on - Martin & Charlie TOGETHER?! ""There came int Egypt a Pharoah that did not know..."", that made no sense 23 years ago or today, but how fantastic are the other lines? John C. McGinley might be my favorite character EVER, Marvin the Mindreader!?

With that, I held off watching WS2 for months.  Why? Oliver Stone isn't what he used to be.  We can all make a case for Any Given Sunday but clearly the halcyon days are behind us.  Plus, given the financial collapse, you had to know the half-communist moralizing would be overpowering.  Plus Michael Douglas is SO OLD.  Plus stupid Shia LaBoeuf is SO TERRIBLE, not in this, in EVERYTHING.  So, I knew I shouldn't have watched it.  I knew it would be like this.

So, I'll rattle off a few of the most egregious offenses:

1. Frank Langella.  The father/son'ish relationship is terrible.  ""I remember you caddying..."" blech.  Jumping in front of a train? FYI the real Bear Stearns guys don't jump in front of a train, they go to their country house and sulk and count their severance.  Totally unnecessary and then you lose Langella and keep LaBoeuf.  Oh, how weird is it when stupid La Boeuf kisses Frank on his bald head?

2. The girlfriend's stupid website.  The B story no one could care about.  She's pregnant, she's got a website, it has a little traffic but if you publish the slightest rumor about evil Brolin he's in cuffs in MINUTES.  Dumb.

3. Music.  Is it me or was it 1) all David Byrne and 2) some stupid song with the word ""home"" in it played a thousand times? I guess I wasn't the only one who enjoyed the Talking Heads in the first flick, huh? Only Stone doesn't know what I do, which is that Byrne is virtually unlistenable since the Heads dissolved.

4. The real estate agent: criminy, she was super old the last time, she looks dessicated here.  Still got the same voice but could we CGI her a little bit???

5. Poor Susan Sarandon.  I suppose if we're going to moralize, we have to pillory a house flipper, but do we have to do it to Sarandon.  Ah, she's strung out on the payments, she should CONTRIBUTE TO SOCIETY and BE A NURSE GARGHH.

6. Motorcycle race.  So Josh Brolin is, a) not the head of his firm but super valuable but b) still at the NY Fed meetings and apparently super-influential and also c) somehow integral in getting Gekko sent to jail, and d) also a super-accomplished super-bike racer just like stupid La Boeuf, and e) not an art collector but has super rare stuff in the study.  Whatever.  Clearly a supervillain, should have a cat and steal nuclear weapons.

7. Renewable energy.  ARGH.  Aside from me never needing to hear 20 minutes on fake renewable energy, how many scenes of the white haired guy calling stupid La Boeuf? 30? ""Shia, I need money, I'm out of money, please more money."" Yuck.

8. The meeting with the Chinese. I've worked with bankers for 15 years.  If you walk into a pitch meeting, they will PITCH until you cannot handle it anymore and go for the door.  Here, Evil Brolin has a 2 minute pitch on some nonsense, and then they're like ""no"", and he's like ""oh"" and then stupid La Boeuf wings it.  Oh so stupid.

9. Gekko's speech.  So Gekko's speaking, and they cut, cut, cut, so you assume his speech is what, 30 minute? 45? Everything he says is SO STUPID and all platitudes you can't imagine not passing out if you had to hear it, but then we cut to the audience and they're all laughing and fired up.  The 4 minute version in the film was intolerable, I never would have survived the whole lecture.

10. Gekko turning evil again, and then getting lame again.  The part where Gekko gets evil is the only high point, like the 10 minutes at the end of Star Wars III is the only high point in the whole 3 prequels there, where Darth shows up.  He gets rad and evil and buys suits and gets his hair cut and then sees a frigging ultrasound and promptly gets lame again.

11.  Brolin's comeuppance.  This is such a pale shadow of the original I could hardly stand it.  Plus, how rad is Terrance Stamp?  Plus, for all the reviews about this being cutting commentary on the recent bout of financial crisis, the comeuppance (as well as Langella's downfall)? START A VICIOUS RUMOR! Not the unraveling of a complicated CDO, just start a rumor.  Brolin gets his because we announce he started a rumor.  SO LAME.

12. The rooftop party.  Mom, Gordon Gekko, the dumb energy guy, the baby, the ""home"" song again.  BWAH.

13. Charlie Sheen.  Oh my heavens.  Even if you know the cameo is coming you can;t be prepared for how bad it is:
a) Sheen cannot act in a drama anymore, he could barely do it then.
b) Gekko can't remember ""Blue Star""? Really?
c) ""Does Blue Horseshoe still love Anacot Steel?"" Hey kids, here's a line you love, let's all say it!
d) ""I made millions and these are girls! I'm Charlie Sheen!""

14. Eli Wallach.  Like Langella, criminally underused.  Is he doing the Lou Mannheim part? At least Holbrook had a dozen lines, ""man looks into the abyss....""

15. Sean Young.  The movie is this utterly terrible and you can't find a walk on for the old girl? You roll out bloated Bud Fox and Sean Young's home waiting for the phone to ring? On the same note, Darryl Hannah can't get a line? WHAT HAPPENED TO HER HOME DECOR BUSINESS? I MUST KNOW.

16.  Naive Melody over the ending credits.  Please don't patronize me.

So other than Gekko in London and some good helicpoter work in NYC, this essentially broke my heart.

I've got four days off coming and I'm going to buy the blue ray of Wall Street and try to pretend like I never saw the second one.",1293667200,23,5844,4.388059701492537
4333730,5,B004DMIIPK,"Great movie, well plotted and dramatic. Douglas, LaBeouf, Mulligan, and Langella all give excellent performances. Not to give anything away, but I was a bit surprised at the direction the movie took towards the end but it sure keeps the drama high and keeps you guessing as to how things will turn out. Be sure to watch through the start of the end credits as it briefly shows what transpires 1-2 years after the main plot.",1293580800,2,423,4.578947368421052
4333731,1,B004DMIIPK,"The first wall street film was a topical and reasonably ok message picture. The story was competent. The acting was good. And the plot was somewhat original. This film, the second film, is pure explotation garbage with a very peculiar message of its own.

The first flaw is that the script lectures rather than tells a story. Every point has to be hammered obsessively just in case we missed it. And in case anyone misses it, you can be sure it will be repeated shortly.

The second flaw is that Oliver Stone's mind is gone. He lives in a world of shadows and conspiracies that cannot be named. The ties to realism in the first film are replaced with hints of the evil men who lurk in the shadows.

The film might have been interesting if it had followed up with the Charlie Sheen character. But instead we get Shia Labeouf. If Stone wanted to dig into conspiracies, he might want to take a look into the improbable rise and never-ending push of an utterly terrible actor. Labeouf is a b-actor great for talking to giant robots that turn into cars or being a sidekick but a dramatic lead he is not. He is in over his head in the film.

Labeouf is Gekko's new underling set up to be corrupted. The story is changed up in that Gekko has a grown daughter this time. And like most of Oliver Stone's women, she is the incorruptable voice of virtue. I found nothing positive in her character. She was another spoiled trust-fund baby talking a good game about virtue while she lives off the proceeds. The daughter is engaged to Labeouf which means lots of whiny boring scenes with her telling him that he should be moral.

The overall message of this film is in some sense the opposite of Wall Street (the original). Greed is not just good, its moral and right. And not only is greed good, greed is the path to restoring your fortune and regaining the love of your estranged daughter. And you can always become a better person by investing the proceeds of greed in ""GREEN TECHNOLOGY"". In many ways, Stone turns Gekko into another victim. Its not Gekko's fault. Its the fault of the men in the shadows who killed JFK and run the government.

And so we have a contradiction at the heart of the film. Greed is bad but it works. Gordon Gekko's greed makes him a billionaire grandfather of a happy family. Labeouf's greed makes him rich and solves all his problems. Gekko's daughter's greed gives her a happy carefree life.

The ultimate message here would seem to be: ""Its good to be rich"" and that greed is a disease only of the poor. The poor need to know their place and leave the good life to the Gekko's of the world.",1293494400,3,2611,4.427083333333333

4333733,1,B004DMIIPK,"I'd never actually seen the original Wall Street and had a free afternoon so I thought I'd rent both the 1987 film and the new one.  That was probably a mistake.  (Spoilers follow.)

The earlier movie had a distinct, driven plot line.  It pursued Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen)'s Faustian bargain with Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas), tracking his ruthless and meteoric rise from boiler-room investment sales hack to big-time wheeler-dealer.  Using his two hours and six minutes masterfully, Oliver Stone gave us just enough technical background on the investments that Fox and Gekko handled to understand, just enough of a peek into the rewards of power and -- all too soon -- just enough insight into how much that power corrupted Fox and disconnected him from his family and friends.  There wasn't a lot of moralizing (hey, we're not stupid, we get it, it's an old morality story), just a fast-paced over-the-shoulder view of a nice guy gone wrong.  Excellent work.

The new movie was... well... I'm still not sure what it was trying to do.  I was GOING to say something about how much longer Wall Street:  Money Never Sleeps was than the 1987 film, but I just looked it up and was astonished to discover that it was a mere seven minutes longer.  (I'd have guessed 45.)

In fairness to WS:MNS, the first movie turned out to have a significant inaccuracy that the later movie tried to address.  In the 1987 film, the bad guys who thought themselves ""invulnerable"" are ultimately found out by the good guys (the SEC).  Okay, that didn't really happen, and for every real-life jailed Michael Milken there were hundreds of corporate raiders whose only concern was lining their pockets and whose only punishment was having to figure out which jet to use on the weekend jaunt to Aruba.  (The Gulfstream's faster but the Starship's interior sets off Tiffany's eyes so much better, don't you know?)  In the real world, a lot of bad guys prospered at the expense of the regular Jane or Joe, as we all know.

WS:MNS, in contrast, tries to communicate this by hectoring us about it constantly without going anywhere.  Apparently, ""Greed... for the lack of a better word... or rather, the things that it makes people do... can comprise enough screen time to create a successful movie, requiring little or no focus.""  Or not.

WS:MNS WANTS to say that the government gave Wall Street a trillion dollar bailout because financiers scared the government into doing it with apocalyptic (and overstated) tales of the collapse of the world financial system, but Oliver Stone was either too lazy or too incompetent to actually do that.  As in his JFK movie, it's so much more fun and easier to just hint at dark designs, creepy conspiracies and government ineffectiveness than it is to actually demonstrate its palpable reality.

In Greed Thread #2, there's a side-story about Gekko's new bright young pawn (sorry, I've forgotten his name) whose mother was once a nurse, someone who helped people, but who was seduced by greed into becoming a real estate something-or-other but who is now up to her neck in a real estate deal gone sour in the then-nascent housing crisis, tapping her investor son for five and six figure checks to tide her over until the market comes back and her ship comes in, even IF there's no reason to think that the market's coming back any time soon.  And in case you didn't get the ""junkie"" analogy all by yourself, Stone staples it to your forehead in the last 15 minutes or so, when the son cuts the mom off (which apparently leaves her in the hole for zillions of dollars) but it all comes out happily after when we see that Mom's back as a nurse (um, nurses are... uh... nice, so I guess the bank let her walk, right?).  Oh, and just in case you didn't get the message -- ""real estate is evil"" or something like that -- Stone brings back the actress who played the real estate agent in the 1987 movie (she sold Charlie Sheen's character his beautiful high-rise apartment) to sell something to Gekko's NEW pawn.  Despite the fact that she sells high-end Manhattan properties and probably does well doing it, she too is greedy and, having lived through a few housing crashes, should know better.  Yawn.  What could have been handled in two 45-second vignettes became, well, even longer than this paragraph.  (Personally I think he could have just grabbed the 50-second chunk from Pretty Woman where Julia Roberts' character asks her friend, ""does anyone ever get out of this business?  More memorable AND funny.)

Then there's The Girl.  She's noble.  She believes in The Right Thing.  She's Gordon Gekko's estranged daughter, and the fiance of Gordon's new pawn.  (Small world, this financier demesne, eh?)  She wants nothing to do with filthy lucre and is openly contemptuous of any money-accumulating behavior on her fiance's part.  Ah, but then we find out that she cares nothing about money because she's got $100 million sitting in Geneva waiting for her to turn 25 and get access to it.  (I THINK that was the deal, I might have gotten it wrong.)  Ah, but Gordon's so greedy that he steals his own daughter's money, parleys it in the middle of the world's largest financial crisis into nearly two billion dollars in just a few weeks, and then gives $100 million to some green-technology startup so that he ends the movie not only rich but reunited with his daughter.  (Sorry, I should have warned you.  Just send me the bill for the whiplash treatment.)

The 1987 movie was a fun and fast flick with a message, ""greed is (ultimately) bad.""  In contrast, the later film is four or five diffuse threads that sort of touch in places, each shrilly repeating the message that ""greed is bad"" but ultimately meaning that well, it's not THAT bad, as Gordie's a multibillionarie and a grandpa now, her daughter and New Pawn are together, and Mom's back to her true calling, as a healer.

It sounds like a formula for a real winner, but sadly, Oliver Stone's Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps is anything but.  Michael Douglas returns to his signature, Oscar-winning role as Gordon Gekko, who has recently been released from prison.  After being sought out by Jake (Shia LaBeouf), the fiance' of his estranged daughter Winnie (Carey Mulligan), Gekko points the young man in a vengeful direction against the powerful Bretton James (Josh Brolin) who Jake believes is directly responsible for the death of his mentor (Frank Langella).  While the melodramatic plot could have easily served as a decent enough backdrop for an examination into the causes of the current financial crisis, Stone instead wastes oodles of potential to focus on the intertwining dramas between Gekko, Jake, Winnie, and James; and while all the players perform admirably enough, the end result leaves one asking just why care about any of the proceedings at all in the first place.  Stone's delivery is heavy-handed, and the end result is a disappointing bore of a film.  Even with old pros like Eli Wallach, Susan Sarandon, and Austin Pendleton along for the ride, the film is just comes off as an overly glossy, half-hearted re-tread of the original film.  All in all, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps is a wholly disappointing sequel that wastes the potential of its backdrop and point, and sadly isn't worth your time in the least.",1293408000,8,1631,4.974264705882353

most movies do not rise to this level- and i think stone's viewpoint is refreshing- the acting is fabulous and stone's commentary is as well

maybe becuz of his father, he feels wall street ""has a heart"" and the capitalism is capable of good things? where is the heart?

contrast moet champagne w Che murdered by the CIA in desolate Bolivia...

to me- the movie ""Baader Meinhof Complex"" is infinitely better in that it shows people (the Baader Meinhof gang) doing things around issues in a much more controversial way- NOT the issue of money and working within the system

what are the tactics that will change the greedy capitalistic, bubble bursting capitalism of america?

stone doesn't deal with this- he suggests ""work within the system"". he does not question the system.  all he implies is that the system will fail again- and on a bigger level?!?!?!

if the character played by shia leboeuf is a good guy in the end because he helps green energy? how far does that get us?

people on wall street are really not taking the risks of a Gandhi, or a Martin Luther King!

There's a scene where Douglas, as Gordon Gekko, is addressing a classful of business students and his speech is cut up, unsure, halting, with dissolves between nearly every sentence (even some overlaps), as if the actor couldn't deliver more than a line at a time.  This is pathetic -- it's the reintroduction of the Gekko character who was such a firecracker in the first movie, and it should've been a kick in the gut, the film's single most powerful moment. Instead it's limp as a dishrag.

I don't think it's Douglas' fault.  He's generally fine in the movie, developing the reptilian Gekko into the slimy character you love to hate.  Carey Mulligan is excellent as his conflicted daughter, and Susan Sarandon has a small but powerful role as Jake's mother.  But Shia LaBeouf makes Keanu Reeves look like a master thespian by comparison, with a range all the way from oak to walnut.  You never once buy him as a financial Wunderkind, much less a loving boyfriend.

The middle of the movie contains a voice-over narration on the evils of Wall Street, and Oliver Stone's patronizing sermon rips the viewer out of the story.  The facts should be allowed to speak for themselves -- which reminds me, Stone could've taken some lessons from Planet Money on EXPLAINING what was going on rather than just throwing industry jargon around.  Stone gets most of the details right (so far as I can tell) but he didn't spend any effort explaining what traunches, CDOs, CDSs and all the rest mean. Shame on him, it was an opportunity to educate.  Finally he almost completely missed (or ignored) the big story behind the news headlines, the overly-cozy relationship between Wall Street and Moody's/S&P, who were *supposed* to be protecting the public.

David Byrne's music is over-used, ill-used and distracting, and it has no connection (lyrically or emotionally) with the story.  Tracks from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Life-in-the-Bush-of-Ghosts/dp/B000E5N634/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Life in the Bush of Ghosts</a>&nbsp;worked well in the first movie but&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Everything-That-Happens-Will-Happen-Today/dp/B001FWRZ1O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Everything That Happens Will Happen Today</a>&nbsp;is nowhere near as good -- or relevant.

""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps"" is a zippy, overly obvious, if a bit meandering picture with a great ensemble cast. Michael Douglas reprises his iconic role of Gordon Gekko with great relish while Shia LaBeouf turns in some of his best work as a cocky, but emotional, up and comer. LaBeouf is turning into quite the dramatic lead and I look forward to more of his work. Carey Mulligan continues her winning streak as Gekko's daughter and the cast is rounded out from seasoned professions like Josh Brolin (re-teaming with Stone after ""W.""), Susan Sarandon, Frank Langella and Eli Wallach. The cinematography may be some of the best of 2010 for the fact that the camera is both reactive and reflective to the characters and the story. Yes, it's stylish, but it does more than just make the proceedings look cool. It serves the story and characters in ways I haven't seen anywhere else recently. Overall, the film is worth seeing for Stone's vivid and stylish imagery, an accurate, but simple, commentary on the financial crisis of the past decade and some good performances. It might not flow as easily as it would like, but the end result is more than worth the trouble of keeping up. I really enjoyed this fun sequel.

Perhaps it is the current economic climate that makes it difficult to find any humor or concern for these characters crippled by the recession: there are no redeeming outcomes form the crash that would suggest that anyone involved with Big Money learned a thing form the government bailout of Wall Street.  But watching the prison release of Gordon Gekko (Douglas) and discovering that his angry, unforgiving daughter Winnie (Mulligan) has taken up with a bright lad Jake (LaBeouf) who in many ways is like the father she loathes, then in a smarmy manner climbing back into the money game only to destroy any seed of conscience that might have grown from his incarceration and in doing so drive a wedge between Winnie and Jake is hardly the stuff of which memorable movies are made.

Oliver Stone's Wall Street is far superior in all areas, and, more importantly, Gordon Gekko is the star not relegated to a supporting actor in Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps (Why not ""Greed Never Sleeps""?). Stone does understand Wall Street since his dad was a stock broker but he fades from the previous inglorious greed and fast paced of the original Wall Street.

Gekko (Michael Douglas) has just gotten out of prison with his ancient 80s cellphone for all the crimes he committed. Shia LaBeouf is a young trader with Frank Langella's firm (think Lehman Brothers in the meltdown) but is no Bud Fox. Unlike Bud Fox's slick descent into being a criminal, the new Gekko protege already commits a crime with no recriminations against Josh Brolin's company. First, you see Gekko hawking his book, Is Greed Good? on CNBC, and at a college.

After Shia and Gekko get acquainted, it is a lot of computer screens and the fall of Langella's trading firm (a Lehman Brothers reference to the recent meltdown). Shia is a pushing some global warming energy company NOT easy capitalism. His wife is a liberal blogger. Both are liberals. Not exactly the Bud Fox and Darryl Hannah coupling. Money never slept for them. Neither did crime and one being a whore.

Gekko, demurred, wants his hands on a $100 million slush fund he left his daughter so he can get back in the game. Shia convinces his wife to let him have it since it was ill-gotten gains and Gekko said it would go to the company trying to make energy from the ocean (nice global warming energy company). Boggles the mind how Stone got so sloppy and literal here. Susan Sarandon's character, and Shia's mom, is an afterthought--filler.

Josh Brolin, the villian, really plays the role and is the only real star in this vehicle. But, unlike Gekko who you liked before, he's evil from the beginning. He wants money anyway he can get it even screwing his own company in the process. Even Gekko wasn't that stupid in the first film. Gekko screwed Bud Fox and BlueStar airlines until Fox got a wake-up call and screwed Gekko (and sent him to jail).

So, with Gekko's connections, Shia has committed a crime, lied to his girlfriend and ruined their relationship in the pursuit of financing a global warming company. Gekko was reformed then finds he way back to being a crook. But, really, Gekko doesn't do anything crooked. The slush fund puts him back in business and he not really doing the old things--sell on insider information.

The other truth in the whole film is that America is broke according to Gekko's book. Ain't that the truth.

The end is anti-climatic, too perfect and needed a good dose of Gekko. Gekko's lust is gone. It ain't Gekko you'll be watching but the rest of the cast. The movie is more Stone espousing his liberal views rather than trying to entertain you like he did so well in Wall Street. Sorry, fans, Greed Went to Sleep.",1292889600,4,2925,4.688109161793372
4333755,3,B004DMIIPK,"No one really expected WALL STREET: MONEY NEVER SLEEPS to live up to the original.  But nobody ever expected Oliver Stone to undermine the original's thematic concept that ""greed is good.""  This film is, in many ways (and this isn't a spoiler, although it sounds like one) Gordon Gekko's redemption.  And Gordon Gekko shouldn't be redeemed.

The film centers on up-and-comer Jake Moore (Shia LeBeouf doing better than usual, though not quite good enough), who happens to be in love with Gekko's daughter (Carrie Mulligan, the moral heart of the film).  Moore decides to take on Gekko's rival Bretton James (a menacing Josh Brolin).  What ensues begins as an intriguing film, with Moore confronting Gekko's immorality head-on.

Michael Douglas is still a solid actor; no one could play this character like he could, and Gekko is still a vibrant villain, still a greedy take-all-comers.  LeBeuf's Moore is an ant compared to him; he's the kind of guy Gekko wouldn't spit on if he were on fire--and what exactly LeBeouf is doing here (and in the latest Indiana Jones fim) is beyond me.  Mulligan belongs here, and so do Brolin--actors capable of holding their own with Douglas in a role he's clearly comfortable in.  The script isn't even half-bad, but the final third of the film is a complete waste of time.  Why Oliver Stone felt he had to end the Gekko legacy this way is a mystery; has Stone gone soft, perhaps?  Either way, WALL STREET: MONEY NEVER SLEEPS is a fine two-thirds of a film, and those two-thirds are easily worth a rental price.  But ultimately, the film is a disappointment; it places too much emphasis on LeBeouf, who is good in some situations but is not capable of carrying a film of this magnitude.  The film also tries to eradicate the original's staying power; fortunately, WALL STREET is such a powerful, thoughtful film that it's here to stay.  The sequel, on the other hand, is forgettable; a rare write-off for Stone.  He's done better, and hopefully will again.",1292803200,3,1989,4.805882352941176

I had been waiting for the sequel ever since announced. Going opening day, I was stunned after watching it the first time. Yes, Oliver Stone nails the Collapse of Wall Street in 2008 with the mortgage meltdown. Every character can be parlayed into a real life individual involved in the Bear Stearns and Lehman collapse. But the real story is about second chances in life, fighting for family, doing the right thing, commitment to work and the price paid for loyalty. Shia Labeouf (Jake Moore) is at his best when he sets out on a course of vindictive revenge after James Brolin (Bretton James) causes the ""perceived"" collapse of Keller Zabel(KZI) and the suicide of his mentor and KZI's leader Lou Zabel.
Michael Douglas (Gordon Gekko) and Shia Labeouf team up given that Jake is engaged to Gordon's daughter Winnie. They embark on path to understand KZI's collapse and to seek revenge, plus make a few dollars along the way for Gordon. Gordon and Jake make a series of ""trades"" to learn that Bretton James and his firm, Churchill Schwartz, were illegally betting on everything under the Sun to destroy KZI. Oliver Stone's attention to detail is STUNNING. Words won't do justice to the perfection of the each set. You have to know Wall Street to know that on a scale of 1 to 100, he gets a 99 because no one gets a 100. Gordon's real redemption is his name, reputation and a deep love for his family. Jake simply wants to do right by the death of Lou Zabel and persecute those respondsible. Wrap those emotions around a fast paced collapse of Wall Street, and you have a beautiful movie. Vetrans of investing will be amazed, but the film has a broad reach. One can't spoil the detail in the screen writer's brillance, but the lines are wit personified. To be ""blamed for all disasters since Nintendo"" speaks to taunt tone and wit. Best line of all is Gordon's---""When you stop telling lies about me, I'll stop telling the truth about you."" Gordon finally does do right. One shouldn't spoil this film. I titled my review ""Love, Life Family...."" The last 20 minutes bring together all aspects of any excellent drama.

I saw the original in the theatre in 1987 and was hoping for a sequel since then. This film was originally to be released in April 2010, but was pushed back to September 2010 as it was included in the Cannes Film Festival, and the studio probably did not want the film to get lost among the summer flotsam.

That said, this film was worth the wait. If you are an aficionado of the original, you will appreciate the homage that this film pays to it. The soundtrack features David Byrne (of Talking Heads fame, featured in the original soundtrack), Gekko bumps into Bud Fox at a party, and LaBoeuf has the same real estate broker as Fox and Darian used...the lady with the annoying voice. Upon his release from prison, Gekko is also handed his brick-sized cellphone, which gives the viewer a glimpse of just how much things have changed since the original. Would have also been nice to bring back Sean Young or Terence Stamp in some capacity. Eli Wallach had a bit part which also delivered comeuppance superbly to Brolin's character.

I think that Michael Douglas must have a clause in his contracts that require his to give at least one great speech in each of his films. For this film, it was when he addressed the college class. Stone truly delivered here, and laid the blame for the crisis exactly where it belongs, which is to say with the majority of us. The reference to the bartender who owned three houses was perfect.

The film's weaknesses are few, but still significant. Specifically, Laboeuf is miscast and comes across about as threatening as a box of facial tissues. Sheen brought a power and passion for both good and bad to the original. Laboeuf seems out of place and definitely out of his depth next to Gekko. I think James Franco would have been far more convincing. Langella was a great fit as Zweibel, but had a far too limited role. Brolin was superlative and can do evil better than most of his contemporaries. Susan Sarandon was great as Labouef's mother.

The other significant weakness in the film is in how neatly the family issues are tied up and concluded. Not unless your family is named Osmond, is atonement and forgiveness as easy as portrayed in the film. I definitely expected better in this regard.

Overall though, well worth the wait. Stone got the details correct.",1291334400,54,2374,4.584905660377358
4333763,3,B004DMIIPK,"Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, the highly anticipated sequel to Oliver Stone's Wall Street from 1987, opened this weekend. If you are a fan of the original film, you may be wondering what Gordon Gekko, the ultimate antihero, would think of the crisis Wall Street has been going through and how he would have fared in such a market.

The story opens in the year 2001 when Gordon (played by Michael Douglas) is released from prison with no fanfare or family to greet him. His only companion leaving prison is a prehistoric cell phone and a check for $1,800.00. Gordon writes a book that predicts a meltdown of the stock market due to sub-prime loans and the bets Wall Street companies were making against their own market. At one of his lectures, his future son-in-law just happens to be in the audience. His name is Jacob (played by Shia LaBeouf) and he has the hunger to beat Wall Street like his predecessor Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen's character in the first film).  Jacob introduces himself to Gordon and Gordon starts using Jacob's desires in order to be reacquainted with his daughter Winnie (played by Carrie Mulligan). He son Rudy, died of an overdose and Gordon states, ""She is all I have left."" Gordon's new mantra is ""time is everything"".

At first you will think that Gordon has found redemption. He is making a modest income with his book profits and his main desire is to have a relationship with his daughter. Winnie shows only distrust for her father and warns Jacob to stay away from him. In the meantime, Jacob finds problems in his own work. First the company that he works for goes under and the owner, a father figure for Jacob, commits suicide. Jacob is in prime mode for some vengeance and Gordon seizes the opportunity for a little manipulation of his own.  Once Gordon starts ""playing the game"" again, he finds that he still a stellar player. But Gordon has no sense of boundaries and his desire for revenge fuels a non-stop ambition that takes prisoners at every step including Winnie and Jacob.

The film moves well and the photography is reminiscent of the first film. All performances all well executed. But the ending of the film just ruins the entire film. The last scene of the film is so incongruent with the rest of the film, that it appears to be written and filmed by another crew. One of the best scenes from the original film is the ending as we see Bud Fox climbing the stairs of the court house to be sentenced to prison. It is an Iconic ending.  Oliver Stone missed a great opportunity to be honest and really send a message to the likes of Gordon Gekko.

I am only the second reviewer here, and I don't disagree much with the first, except that for me, the disappointment in a weaker performance than part 1 makes me rate only 3 stars.
Part 1 was a consistent, compact, powerful story full of world wisdom. The sequel still has a lot to say about the world as such and finance capitalism in specific, but it is far too didactic to be impressive. The story has too many sub-plots, it is less a straight tale than a collection of snippets.
The film is essentially about the Lehman-like bank crash and following events towards a world crisis. Stone has this time not succeeded in creating an iconic figure like Gordon Gekko who symbolized 'greed' in the Reagan years. The only fully convincing bad guy here is Eli Wallach, who deserves a best supporting Oscar for the meanest ugliest evilest barracuda of the millennium, but unfortunately his part is a minor one.
The old Gekko shows up again and is involved in the tale, but not on the same powerful level as Michael Douglas 25 years ago. Yes, he is a plot driver, but he is not a screen dominator as he was before.
There is far too much voice from the off too, mostly (or all?) by Shia La Beuf, or whatever way you spell that. The young man is also not in the same class as Charlie Sheen was 25 years ago.",1290643200,12,1403,4.358778625954199

""Bulls make money, bears make money.  They pigs?  They get slaughtered.""  This is rock solid entertainment with wisdom to spare.  And, it warrants MULTIPLE viewings.

And to top it off, as a former Wall Streeter who spent endless hours on the trading floor of one of the biggest brokerage firms, I can tell you that they got the details right.",1290297600,64,518,4.688888888888889
4333766,5,B004DMIIPK,"Twenty three years have passed since the original Wall Street introduced Gordon Gekko, the insider trader who insisted `Greed is good' and `Lunch is for wimps', and eventually receives a jail sentence. The film stood up on its own, almost defining a whole `Yuppie' generation, so why bring out a sequel now?
The current global financial crisis represents a perfect opportunity to explore the human element behind what is happening. Oliver Stone is saying that not only did we fail to learn the lessons of the stock market crash following October 19th 1987, but with an avalanche of toxic debt, economic stagnation, and the prospect of long term recession, the worst could be yet to come.
Having turned writer while in prison, with `Is Greed Good?' Gekko lectures college undergraduates on basic economics. Arguably a high point of the film, I liked the image he portrayed of prison as time to reflect on sanity, and the contrast of the world viewed through the bars, a world going even madder `it's ugly times ugly, and that's when the ugly get going', succinctly summarizing corporate greed.
In Wall Street, Gekko was greed. Here, he takes on the role of a ""wise sage"", someone who has experienced the terrible consequences of greed. What is greed, in any case? An emotional response to the temptations caused by the ""this is not enough"" syndrome? Or is it a rapacious mental desire for excess? Why does greed manifest more prominently in some people, especially (and ironically) in those who have it all?

In this storyline at any rate, I would have liked more antagonism between Gekko and banker Bretton James (Josh Brolin) who didn't convince as a villain, despite his painting of choice, the morbid `Saturn Devouring His Son' by Goya. In the confrontation between them however, Gekko says, `I will do a trade with you. If you stop telling lies about me, I'll stop telling the truth about you', a great quote, but it wasn't clear what the lies were. We like a villain, but Gekko was already in this role, and if the premise of the film was: Is he reformed or is he not? the storyline became complicated here.
Other minor moans. I would have liked to see less slick shots of Manhattan. I know they are a trademark of Oliver Stone's, but they took up too much time; the plot was interrupted. Secondly, the ending was weak. Somehow, Gekko got his hands on estranged daughter Winnie's ( Carey Mulligan) $100m trust fund. Clearly, the crafty old lizard was not completely reformed. As portrayed, during her (presumably) nine month pregnancy, Gekko turned it into $1.1bn. He did so by buying British government financial assets at knockdown prices, that at least was feasible! He then returned the $100m to the pet fusion project of fianc Jake Moore (Shia LeBoeuf) in a move of reconciliation. The money was clearly safer in the care of dad. Incidentally, the fusion project, `clean, green energy for nothing', predicts a future for investment in reality more of a gamble than even here portrayed.
At the beginning of the film, Jake invests $1m of his own bonus on 50% margin into his bosses bank Keller Zabel and keeps his position even as the stock is plummeting, putting him debt (film hinted $0.5 mil). Firstly, firms usually prohibit employees on speculating on their own stock due to the possibility of having insider information and secondly if Jake was such an excellent prop trader he wouldn't have touched the stock if there were rumours of collapse.
Personally, I didn't like the subplot with Jake's mother (Susan Saradon) who seemed in the film to epitomise the property developer's nightmare, a portfolio of properties without buyers, no capital to complete them, and rapidly diminishing values. Her son's bailouts ensured she didn't find more constructive solutions, but his lecturing just sounded priggish.
I would have liked to see more of old fashioned banker Louis Zabel (Frank Langella). He was under immense pressure, `They tell me they're making money on losses, how do you make money on losses?' His bank went the way of Lehman brothers, or in the same timescale as the film, Bear Sterns. At this point, real life was undoubtedly more exciting than fiction. The story is told in 'House of Cards: A Tale of Hubris and Wretched Excess on Wall Street', a 2009 finance novel written by William D. Cohan. It chronicles the history of Bear Sterns, from its founding in 1923 to its collapse and sale to JP Morgan in 2008, following the subprime mortgage crisis.
Why do I give `Money never sleeps' five stars? For two reasons. Firstly, and without forgetting the rest of the cast, for putting Michael Douglas's portrayal of Gordon Gekko back in the spotlight, older and wiser, `time is the most valuable commodity I know', and secondly, for sounding a warning over a financial system out of control, government bailouts cushioning bad practice and distorting decision making, the speed at which financial markets can fall, and the folly of unsubstantiated stock growth, and lessons unlearnt. How big will the bubble get before it bursts? Again?",1288742400,,5056,4.8859138533178115
4333767,4,B004DMIIPK,"Let no-one pretend that Oliver Stone's original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wall-Street/dp/B000Y9Q59W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wall Street</a>, a legend in its own right, wasn't a cheesy, glitzy, bombastic pastiche. That's what made it so good: Stone's singular genius has always been his ability to harness the oceans of cheese, syrup, paranoia and hyperbole at Hollywood's disposal to make his point. To complain that this long-awaited sequel is frequently simplistic or corny, at least by comparison, is therefore well wide of the mark.

Stone doesn't do art house, and you can expect, among flowing rivers of stock-tickers, coursing Madison Avenue traffic and tumbling dominoes, to be walloped fairly firmly over the head with every significant development in the film. You may have no fear of blinking: you won't miss anything. Except, perhaps, the significance of the rheumy-eyed and wizened old grandee who pops up at critical points in the drama to do portentous whistling bird impersonations. That stumped me completely, and I dare say I wasn't the only one.

Instead, give thanks that Gordon Gekko is back: An aged Michael Douglas has a whale of a time throughout: the eyes may be dimmer, the brow more creased, but the sparkle is there. As it is with the film, as long as it follows the money (advice Gekko would endorse): it is liquid, volatile, assured, intelligent, incisive and surprisingly even handed in its assessment of the latter day moral hazard.

It gets more mired when it goes offroad into the illiquid, sticky depths of the tangled Gekko family history: Carey Mulligan, as Gekko's daughter Winnie, battles with a conflicted (bordering on nonsensical) role prone to winsome smiling, floods of tears and a tendency to walk out at (and sometimes before) the first sign of trouble. Gekko's motives are confused: the film can't decide whether he's in this for reconciliation posterity, for revenge, or simply ""for the game"". Perhaps, in a way, that's the moral point.

Similarly, Shia LaBeouf's Jacob Moore fluctuates between cocksure, instinctive prop trader, misty eyed eco dreamer (he thinks he's stumbled on something sounding awfully like a perpetual motion machine) and dopey, gullible rookie kid depending on how the situation presents itself. Moore is more&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ralph-Maccio/dp/B000NJLQ88/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ralph Maccio</a>&nbsp;than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Charlie-Sheen/dp/B0009KKWAY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Charlie Sheen</a>: he's too earnest by half, and too nice by three quarters, it being the 2000s and all (apparently mankind gave up philandering in the late 1980s). As a result, despite talking a lot about it, the film never quite generates the same electricity that its predecessor mustered in 1987.

Gordon Gekko remains the beating heart of the film.  Around him twirl flying ticker tape, bouncing stock charts and bubbles of all shapes and sizes: bubbles which, as we know, cause destruction, but which Stone gently reminds us (as in a children's party) can transfix us with fascination, (as in the Cambrian explosion) are the source of all life and (as in the womb) are the source of regeneration. This is no anti-capitalise screed: We need bubbles: it is a lesson of physics as much as economics that there is no return without risk

In 1987 Gordon Gecko carefully qualified his famous statement: ""Greed,"" he said, ""for lack of a better word, is good"". With his allusion to evolution, revolution, the passage and renewal of life and the inevitable cycle of human frailty, in 2010 Oliver Stone has found that better word: greed is inevitable.

4333768,3,B004DMIIPK,"I found this an interesting and enjoyable movie--not an action film, but an information film.

As the film opens, xxx Gekko (Michael Douglas) is being released from an 8 year prison term for insider trading and xxx.  His daughter is in a serious relationship with xxx LaBeouf and she is still very angry with Daddy.  She blames him for the heartbreak in her family and wants nothing to do with him.  Her boyfriend is a Wall Street analyst and is pretty good with alternative energy investments.  Wanting to help father and daughter resolve their differences, he steps in between them.  In doing so, he gets to know daddy a lot better.

Within the story, you meet LaBeouf's former boss (Frank Langella), who is no longer at the top of his game.  You also meet Brolin's son, a stop-at-nothing billionaire investment firm owner.  Even Eli Wallace (The Good, Bad and the Ugly/The Godfather/many other films) has a part in the world of money as an aged mentor to the big money guys.

Although I didn't understand a lot of the investment terminology, it didn't really matter.  It was easy enough to follow the greed, power, money plays.  In an ""eat your young"" world, you are on top one minute and have lost everything the next.

4333769,3,B004DMIIPK,"This film is a sequel to Oliver Stone's 1987 masterwork which brought to light the corrupt practices of unscrupulous stock market traders.  That film ended with the powerful Gordon Gekko, played by Michael Douglas, going to jail.  And so this new film opens with the supposedly older and wiser Gordon Gekko now getting out.  Years have gone by but the man has not changed much and even though he professes that he has changed, the audience knows better.

In this film, like the previous one, there is a young, smart and ambitious young man working in a Wall Street firm who is in the process of learning the tricks of the trade while watching the destruction of some of the older leaders who are losing their businesses because of worthless debt.  In a twist to the plot, he's also involved romantically with Gekko's daughter.  How this all plays out makes the film drag.  It's the money and the trading that is the most interesting, not a simple romance which has no surprises.

Some of the casting is excellent, especially Eli Wallach who, at age 95, is perfect in his role as an aging Wall Street executive with a sense of honor. There are also some real life newscasters playing themselves.  In some ways the film feels as fresh as recent headlines.  But in other ways it just doesn't have the cutting edge that the previous film had.  There is also just too much dependence of special effects and computer graphics.  This kind of stuff might be nice but it just doesn't compare to a good script.

Generally the acting was good, but Gekko having a change of heart just didn't seem in character for him.  And the greediness and corrupt behavior of Wall Street executives is not a surprise to anyone nowadays.",1286755200,2,1711,4.622516556291391
4333770,2,B004DMIIPK,"Marginally better than the original stinker Wall Street, there were spots in this film that were engaging, even if I was checking my watch at other times.  While more mature cinematographically and done with a larger budget, Money Never Sleeps is still marred by Oliver Stone's heavy-handedness, tin ear, and inability to create believable plots and characters or to cast appropriately.  Like the original, this entire film rides not on any artistic merit but on the inherent sexiness of money and power and Michael Douglas' ability to embody it.

My theory is that the script for this movie started life as an art student project about a girl who raises money to discover alternative energy by kissing a young Wall Street frog and turning him into a leftist eco-prince.  Then Oliver Stone got hold of it and added board room scenes and a styrofoam villain and made it ""topical"" by mentioning the housing crisis, which is really only incidental to the film.

The only possible real drama in the film--the relationship between Gordon Gekko and his daughter--is gutted by a Deus ex Machina sonogram, and even this is ruined by a lame ending in which Gekko shows up and convinces the lovers to get back together by pointing out that nobody's perfect.  Much more interesting would have been for Gekko to keep the money he steals but point out to his daughter that her behavior of sacrificing her family out of rigidity proves that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.  She is in her own way just as selfish and short-sighted as her father.  Then we could have seen some real struggle and growth, but it wouldn't have been PC, so instead the girl sacrifices nothing and gets to live in a giant expensive apartment while acting like a poor Earth-friendly hippie and the guy ends up in a purple cardigan.  The most satisfying part of the movie was knowing that when Gekko gives back the movie, he's already dec-tupled it so he still has plenty of bank.

And you know that scene where LaBeouf tells the girl ""this thing's going to happen again and again because want to hear comforting stories""?  I'm sure the execs were sitting around puffing cigars and laughing over this line because it really describes Hollywood.",1286755200,,2214,4.754569190600522
4333771,5,B004DMIIPK,"I loved the film, the cinematography, and the music score. But I think it is not as a heavy weight as the original Wall Street film in the realm of ideas. But in the world we are living today, a cautionary tale about dangers of moneymaking on insider information is no longer valid. Today, a spread of the global communications, rise of derivative instruments - futures, options, and swaps - made it a mundane thing for the investment banks and hedge funds to gamble on information. That's why the Stone's sequel isn't about using insider information; rather it's about using disinformation and profiting from it.

The first film was a film of ideas: it was an age-old story of Faust retold. The Wall Street Mephistopheles, the Grand Seducer by name Gordon Gekko made young trader Bud Fox (played by Charlie Sheen during his more coherent years) do immoral things for profit and for the sake of power. Fox paid the price (imprisonment), and in the end he redeemed himself. The villain's darkness helped to illuminate the important things that had been obscure to Bud Fox in the beginning.

This sequel, while still good and filmed with quirky zoom-in and zoom-out camera, nevertheless doesn't position itself as a Foust-like tragedy. As a critique of the American capitalism, it is tongue-in-cheek. The Brolin's character (CEO of the evil investment bank Churchill Schwartz, a veiled portrait of Goldman Sachs) is not a real villain. He is like George W. Bush (Brolin's previous role) - firm, combative, but insecure, one-sided and vengeful. Also, there is no Gretchen he can offer. Brolin isn't a villain of the Gekko a la 1987 caliber. Where is the villain? It is not Brolin, not aging Gekko 2010, not Churchill Schwartz, not even capitalist system per se.

I think the real villain is missing - what Stone wanted but failed to flesh out is a deformed capitalism which has so far captured the U.S. - a laissez faire-ish financial capitalism based on ideas of neo-liberal Chicago-school economics. It was sold to the American ruling class who thought that the progressive social agenda could be piggybacked to the deregulated markets espoused by that type of capitalism. Obama has changed nothing - his economic policies are being shaped by the same people - many of them with close links to Wall Street (like Tim Geithner, N.Y. Fed President at a time - also a personage in the film). These people helped to dismantled Roosevelt's curbs on the banking system during the Clinton era. In the end, Stone shouldn't lament that the American politics have been captured by a financial oligarchy. After all, why we would be watching his movies if this weren't the case?

As for me, I think the situation is far more radical and we all are already living in the simulated world of dystopian Matrix, a simulacra, surrounded by a digital rain of symbols and signs, meaningless, but all-pervasive. If this is what Stone wanted to show - I think we may have seen some glimpses of that in the film.",1286496000,,2987,4.816764132553606
4333772,3,B004DMIIPK,"There are a lot of great moments in Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps (2010), director Oliver Stone's sequel to the landmark 80s film Wall Street (1987). I wish I could say that all those great moments add up to more, but they don't. Wall Street 2 is a good solid movie and well worth seeing for anyone who has seen the first one, but I feel like it lives a bit in the shadow of the original, like so many sequels. A few rare sequels that I think outshine their masterful predecessors are The Bourne Supremacy (2004), Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980), Superman II (1980), and Clear and Present Danger (1994). But those sequels are the exception to the rule to say the least. I give the original Wall Street 3.5 out of 5 stars and the sequel 3 out of 5 stars. Both movies have scenes that are a perfect 5, but the narrative that wants to tie these unbelievable scenes together in both movies doesn't quite work. Something doesn't quite gel. Regardless, both movies are well worth watching, and the timing for the sequel is perfect. I saw it in the theater on Friday, opening day. I'm curious to see the opening week box office numbers to see how others responded to it. The trailers were perfect and got me extremely psyched to see the film right when it came out. And there are some great scenes in the film not revealed in the trailer.

Shia LaBeouf is excellent as the young whipper-snapper protege replacement for Charlie Sheen, along with Carey Mulligan as his love interest and the daughter of Gordon Gekko. Josh Brolin plays the new 2000's Gordon Gekko replacement bad guy with perfect ease. And Gekko himself is reprised by the great Michael Douglas. There's no question in my mind that Douglas deserved his Oscar win for Best Actor as Gekko in the original Wall Street. It was and still is the role that defines him in my mind. The Academy got it right with that award for that particular role and not another. No one ever wonders who else could have been Gekko. Douglas owns this role. And we see flashes of that same brilliance 23 years later in Wall Street 2. The thing about film sometimes is that it has to age like wine. It might be bold and exciting when its young, but its true impact and depth can't always be appreciated until years later after it has sat awhile. The original Wall Street is now clearly an iconic and defining film from the height (and end) of the Reagon 80s...that ""greed is good"" time in our history that brought us to the collapse now in 2008-2010 when greed is no longer just good, it's legal, as Douglas quips in the new movie. I recently re-watched the original film and loved getting back into that time of cell phones the size of sub sandwiches.

What I'm left with from both of these movies is a realization that money and greed really aren't the game that's played on Wall Street. The game is ""King of the Hill"". Money is simply what's used to keep score in the game.",1286236800,8,2931,4.435992578849722

Unfortunately, the person he's trying to swindle this time is someone very close to him, which makes him look like even more of a villain than he did in the original.  However, will he stay that way or come to his senses?  That's what you'll find out if you see this movie.

The cast is full of actors I like: Michael Douglas, Frank Langella, Susan Sarandon, Carey Mulligan, Eli Wallach and Josh Brolin (yes, Shia LaBeouf too if I am able to get ""Transformers 2"" out of my mind).  And I'm usually a fan of most of Oliver Stone's films.  However, the storyline in this movie just seemed too predictable and dragged slowly along.  I had trouble not daydreaming about other things while some of the slower, uninteresting scenes were taking place.

If you saw the original ""Wall Street"", you almost have to see this one to see how it all turns out.  And, yes, you do get to see Charlie Sheen as Bud Fox for a short time.  But overall, I don't think this sequel lives up to the original in terms of a fast-paced plot that keeps you intrigued.

4333776,5,B004DMIIPK,"Michael Douglas is in top form in reprising his most famous/infamous character - financier Gordon Gekko. His young co-stars (Shia LaBoeuf and Carey Mulligan) try to keep up but don't quite get there. Don't fault them - few can run with Douglas, especially when he's deconstructing the contradictions that undergird modern commercial society.
 Gekko is out of prison and out with a book. He's talking about moral hazard and the twinkle in his eyes tip us that he's willing put up his dukes again in the game of hazard even though he talks like a recovering addict.
 It turns out that Gekko and would-be son-in-law Jacob (LaBoeuf) have the same target - a master hazard duker named Bretton James. Someone needs to scour the original ""Wall Street"" to look for the James character. I suspect he's not there.
 Josh Brolin plays James. Director Oliver Stone cast Brolin as Bush 43 in ""W."" Some might suspect Stone of needling the Bush White House through the casting but Stone is fair to Bush. There's even a line where Gekko and left-leaning daughter Winnie (Mulligan) agree that W. and Co. didn't cause the meltdown. The fact that Obama can't get Stone to throw a propaganda rabbit punch one month before the mid-term election is the surest sign yet that Barack may be a one-termer.
 Charlie Sheen makes a cameo (no Daryl Hannah, though) and that's the closest we come to flashbacks to the ""Wall Street"" of 1987. New music from the incomparable David Byrne keeps our minds straddled between the two eras but the only talking heads we're treated to are the financial junkies' favorites - CNBC's Maria Bartiromo, David Faber, and Sue Herera et al.
 The ""Money Never Sleeps"" subtitle is the recognition of 24-hour financial markets and their worldwide power. Greed, fear and our complicity in the mammouth profligacy are themes Stone strongly weaves into his script. We should be sobered by Gekko's explanation of the ""ninja"" generation.
 Stone gets close to identifying the Federal Reserve's destructiveness when Gekko talks of the bubble created when interest rates were driven down to 1 percent after 9/11. Later The Fed poses as savior. The bailouts are at odds with justice, but as Stone shows us, there's no easy way out (for the record, the banks did repay the government). The Fed is not completely the villain either since if Washington balanced its budget the central bank could largely escape being bubble-maker of last resort. As Gekko, summarizes it so well, ""Human beings...Got to give them a break. They're all a mixed bag.""
 That's a good prayer but the lack of religion among the ""Money Never Sleeps"" characters is conspicuous. It probably explains why Wall Street thinks the end of Big Finance is the end of life on Earth. They're self-absorbed in a colossal way. The human race will find different forms in dealing with this age-old problem of material provision. ""There's nothing new under the sun,"" King Solomon says in Eccelsiastes. (Interesting that ""Wall Street 2"" hit the theaters during the holiday of Sukkos, when Eccelsiastes is read). Contra Ben Bernanke, Hank Paulson and Larry Summers, Big Finance's waterloo is not the same thing as nuclear holocaust. Gekko ties it all together again by showing how the absence of religion boils everything down to a fetid struggle for power. The financier tells Jacob - ""It's not about the money. It's about the thing between people.""
 For those interested in getting out of the labyrinth and resurrecting stability, the way was shown by Moses in Egypt. The courage of President Reagan and Paul Volcker during the 1982 recession is a modern example. It comes down to living with the facts that corrections take time and things will get worse before they get better (and don't be fooled by the false dichotomy of government ""help"" versus ""doing nothing."").

The movie also lacked an original storyline. However, like the first one, this one was at least also entertaining with its devious characters.

Offensive to women: The main actress, played by Carey Mulligan, was wronged many times by two men (won't give details as it would spoil the movie if you do watch it). Each time she not only stayed quiet, but took them back without a fight, as if women cannot possibly live without men in their lives to save them. At another point, a woman and a man fought for an investor's money; the man won (surprise, surprise).

Lack of diversity: All the characters were white except for one Chinese investor. I realize this is unfortunately probably a reality of Wall Street, but it would have been nice to see more diversity, even in smaller ways.

Lack of original storyline: The plot was basically the same as the first movie, with a predictable ending.

The premise was entertaining, but I wish it would have been executed differently. So, unfortunately, though money never sleeps, it seems that we should have, instead of watching this cringeworthy movie.",1522368000,,1246,4.78139534883721
8425733,3,B004DMIIPK,"i have to disagree with a comment,

i think that michael douglas's gordon gekko in this sequel, sounds changed
from his previous wall street installment

and i kinda have to compare how gordon gekko in this film changed respectfully
to how another michael douglas character, tom sanders, in the warner brothers film disclosure,
had to go through redemption after being bullied by a co worker
to try to confront bad people at the work place

and how this ties to the scenario with gordon gekko is, that
people can change",1521504000,,519,4.7444444444444445
