3165880,5,B00170JQAC,"""Western Lights"" is an amazing and very entertaining movie.
It has restored my confidence in the good in human nature and in the desire in
people to get along with others. It is appropriate that this lesson is taught by a
group of boys.

This is an adventure movie and it documents a sailing trip following in the footsteps
of Christopher Columbus from the Continent to the Americas in 1492.

The trip is undertaken by a group of 12 boys who have prepared themselves well
for the trip. They all have a good knowledge of the Columbus voyage and are
enthusiastic to learn more. They all know the basics of good seamanship - how to
navigate and set a course and how to rig and sail the ship. They all possess other
skills which may prove to be required. With a group of boys this large and all living
close together, you would expect some disagreements but this did not happen.
They all very quickly became good mates. They listened to and respected each
others views and were eager to share with other boys their own personal
knowledge and opinions.

This is an adventure and probably the biggest adventure that they will
experience in their lives. They visited all the ports of call and prominent landmarks
on the way. They took exploration trips on land and sea, visiting at times the
most inaccessible places. They also participated in snorkeling activities.

What a pleasant experience both for the boys and the viewers of this movie. All
parents and their children should be encouraged to view ""Western Lights"". It is
both entertaining and educational and there is a lot to learn from it about human
behaviour and tolerance.

I believe that this film has been condensed to a two hour running time from a 13
episode documentary made for French television. It may be regarded as a documentary
but it is also a story about individuals. The dialogue is spoken in French and
there are English sub-titles. However, don't let this throw you. It is worth
every cent that I paid for the disc.

The movie doesn't specifically follow Columbus' first voyage, but rather visits places he visited during his four trips to the new world.  A visit is made off the Paria Peninsula of Venezuela and then north past the islands of Grenada, Martinique, Guadeloupe, and others in addition to a visit to Central America where Columbus visited on his fourth and final trip to the Caribbean.  Throughout the movie the boys ask questions about ancient findings they come across while their shipmates seem to have an answer for them.  The photography is good and we see underwater scenes as well.  The boys speak French throughout the movie which adds some exotic flavor to it, but this requires an English translation which can be annoying when you are trying to view the movie instead of having to read the spoken words in English.

8264451,3,B00170JQAC,Michael Noll's home video version culled from an original French Television documentary is both adventurous and historical.  Twelve boys who are students from an experimental school are given an assignment to work on board a sailing ship navigating the route  Christopher Columbus charted sailing to the new world.  On board the ship Karrek Ven the boys encounter adventures and learning  experiences not found inside the classrooms.  This cinema is an amazing historical account of what Columbus discovered on his way journey to the new world.  WESTERN LIGHTS combines the excitement of twelve young students working together and discovering a new world for themselves.,1408406400,2,670,5.456310679611651
8264452,5,B00170JQAC,"When I was the age of the boys in this film our family had a sailboat which gave me many great memories growing up. This movie gave me a way to relive a bit of my childhood while at the same time being educational. The boys would have discussions with each other about Columbus and then reenact how he traveled over here.

While I enjoyed this immensely I thought some of the information was incomplete in that it skipped over a lot of the really bad parts about Columbus personality such as his brutal treatment of his slaves and of the native people. This was a really import part of his story so I wish it hadnt been white washed.

Also as a major side note to the movie itself the video quality is very poor and is in desperate need of a major restoration. I wonder if someone could create a Kickstarter campaign to fund its restoration? I would love for that to happen. I should mention that my rating does not reflect the films quality only the actual movie itself.

It is too bad that the price has inflated to such absurd heights. As of this writing you now have to pay $180 to watch it (legally.) That is the problem with places like Amazon that are based on supply and demand. I checked it out at my local video store, Scarecrow Video, for about $1.80 for a full week. It is sad that many people don't see the value of brick and mortar video stores these days. Stores like this provide great value for people looking for hard to find titles but they are closing down left and right.",1404691200,,1492,4.283687943262412

8264454,5,B00170JQAC,"This documentary shows the involvement a group of teenagers has in their quest in tracing Columbus route to the New World.

Now if we can only see a group of American teenagers get this much involved in any project, that will really be something to see.",1382227200,,431,4.468354430379747
8264455,5,B00170JQAC,"Observing the boys as they follow and learn about Christopher Columbus' journey, and about the other history of the places they visit was interesting. This is not a scripted movie, but rather a reality show, before reality shows were a fad. It is also more interesting than most of the reality shows on TV today.
The movie is only part of the thirteen episodes which showed on French television, I think I would enjoy watching the full thirteen episodes.
The boys are shown not only learning about history, but are also shown learning about archeology, geology, navigation, sailing (they are both students and crew), and wood working (they build some items out of wood to install on the boat while they are staying in one of the ports along the way). I am sure they also have to study regular school courses, but that is not shown.
I am also sure a lot of boys would enjoy school a lot more if they could attend wearing their swim suits, or cutoffs, to say nothing of the extra excitement and fun of learning these subjects with an hands on approach instead of just out of a book.
The pace of the movie is not fast, but it is a lot of fun.
There are a couple of brief skinny dipping scenes in the movie. Once off of a rocky coast line where all of the boys are seen nude from the rear while getting in the water and playing about. The skinning dipping scene lasts about 30 seconds. Later the boys swim nude off the boat, this scene last about a minute, but actually less nudity is seen due to back lighting and camera angles.",1375660800,,1525,4.373239436619718
