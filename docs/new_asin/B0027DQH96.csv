One could lament song selection , play time , etc or simply marvel at this beautifully photographed and recorded 22 Yr (thank you Mr. Tibbetts) old concert as easily  .",1458777600,,301,4.788461538461538

8354591,5,B0027DQH96,"This is the kind of playing I love to hear from Rypdal. It's unusual without being irritating or off-putting. The whole show delighted me. If only he'd show a bit more consistency with great music and playing and less of the exasperating stuff such as Vossabrygg and ""And the Sky Was Coloured With Waterfalls and Angels"" from his Melodic Warrior album. Btw, I noticed some regrettably empty seats even at the small venue this band played in. I only wish I could see him in concert.",1431561600,,481,4.604651162790698
