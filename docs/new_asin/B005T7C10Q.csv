8485973,1,B005T7C10Q,"I guess it is not fair that I give it a 1 star. In all fairness, I did not watch this video all the way to the end. From the parts I have seen, I was not impressed. I don't think it is fair that people can post poor quality videos of their family vacation and title it as a documentary on Sasquatch. This video, like several others by Mitchell Waite, include several hours of filming trees with a low quality hand held camera and personal theories about the ""Mogollon Monster"" from Northern Arizona.

If you are looking for real interviews of close encounters, scientific feedback from experts, or the latest of irrefutable evidence on this mystery.....keep searching. This is a homemade video, not a documentary. Don't get me wrong, the Waite family has probably done a better job than I could do making a video and they get out there more than the average ""researchers"", but this video was not what I was expecting.

I feel the Waite family really does believe that what they are providing is actual evidence but I think this video demonstrates wishingful thinking, not evidence. This video is more of an example of how some researchers allow their imagination to get the best of them.",1429315200,,1187,4.62085308056872

8485976,1,B005T7C10Q,"What kind of Lowlife leaves an awesome review on his product in hopes that someone will read his review and think the DVD is worth buying? Michael Waite is one such lowlife. I grew up in the White Mountains of AZ and the Mogollon area, and know of no such monster.",1378684800,,264,4.196078431372549
8485977,5,B005T7C10Q,"This is one of the best documentaries that really shows Bigfoot Research as it really is. I like they way that it is not glamorized much like the Bigfoot TV shows. It is lots of hard work, and then lots of sheer terror when you find something. These guys worked hard at it, and I hope there is much more to come.",1336089600,4,312,4.048387096774194
