3445773,5,B001A64KHW,"This DVD is about a year in a garden.  It happens to be the Queen's garden at Buckingham Palace, but it could be any garden.  You do not have to be a royal watcher to enjoy this book.  There is lots of time lapse photooraphy of flowers bursting into bloom, fruit growing, etc.  It's spectacular.  They put cameras in bird boxes to watch baby birds grow.  We see birds, bugs, and animals in extreme close-ups.  The gardeners, beekeepers, historians, and others tell us about their jobs.  We learn what kinds of wildlife inhabit the garden.  We learn how the gardeners use the manure from the royal stables as compost, and other natural methods they use to defeat garden pests.  I'm not a nature lover or a royalty lover, but the time lapse photography made this a really cool video to watch.",1436745600,3,790,4.539007092198582
3445774,1,B001A64KHW,"This is not a garden tape, it's a nature tape.  It is a recording of a fifty year old film. Of all  (over 200) the dvds It is by far the worst!!!",1430956800,2,145,3.5

8276215,3,B001A64KHW,"I think ""garden""is ""English"" for the American ""back yard"", in this case you get to see what would normally be a limited access Park behind Buckingham Palace. Filmed over a years time it spends more time with the nature side of things than the ""history"" although it has a good serving of that too. The Royal family is represented mostly by The Queen and Prince William but you see some of the others too.
The DVD starts and finishes with a ""Garden Party"" that a large number of everyday Britons are invited to, you'll see more of it than they do I'm sureand probably more than tourists can get access to when the Palace is open for tours.
My DVD is as clear as the broadcast (one reviewer complained about image quality).
Worth owning if you have any interest in Royalty/Nature.",1495152000,,777,4.5177304964539005
