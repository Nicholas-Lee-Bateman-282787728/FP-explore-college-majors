3955562,2,B002N5L4W8,"Horrible cueing.  The segments for 1/2nd trimester had the host doing first trimester and the other girl doing second, but more often than not would not show the 2nd trimester girl.  The was frequent cueing without instruction (""tilt""...tilt what? and since the camera is only shoulder up I can't tell what you are tilting!).  In general, the camera angles did not allow you to view form effectively.  There are many other prenatal vidoes that offer the same thing but in a more effective manner.",1291248000,2,496,4.869047619047619
3955563,5,B002N5L4W8,"I love this workout.  I was an intermediate exerciser before pregnancy and found some other prenatal DVDs too easy after the first trimester, and others, like Perfect Pregnancy Workout, too intense.  This one strikes the right balance for me between worked out and worked to death.  The set is a bright, modern living room setting and the music is pleasant without being annoying.

I'm always bemused by people who diss workouts for not being intense enough, as though a puke-in-a-bucket workout is the only option.  I bought this workout in the 2nd trimester and found that the 2nd and 3rd trimester sections combined with either the Core & Butt or Flexibility section gave me a great 35 to 40 minute workout that left me feeling energized, not drained.  I especially like the Core section that has a section that works the obliques in cat pose and it stretches my lower back out nicely.

This was my first Tracey Mallett purchase and I like this workout enough to try her other DVDs.  She's not the best cuer and there are a few microphone glitches, but nothing serious.",1286668800,9,1072,4.725806451612903
3955564,3,B002N5L4W8,"I wanted to like this video, however it just isn't challenging for me.  I am now in my third trimester and when I tried the third trimester workout it was just a waste of my time.  Ditto with the core/lower body segment.  I have stayed very fit throughout my pregnancy, working out nearly every day, and I don't need to hold on to a chair while lifting a 3 lb. weight with one hand!  Prior to pregnancy I was high int/low advanced and have been working out pretty consistently for about 17 years (!), so perhaps this dvd would offer a challenge to someone less experienced.  There is very little cardio involved in the cardio sections.  I do prefer weight lifting to cardio but when I am doing a cardio segment I expect to actually do cardio.  The dvd back cover recommends 3-5 weights; upping that could help make this more effective.  Very few reps are performed.  Also I find it annoying that the dvd reverts back to the menu in between each circuit.  Mine did not allow me to program it.  I want to work out, not be continually reaching for my remote.  I intend to trade this away as soon as possible.",1281916800,2,1105,4.362745098039215
3955565,5,B002N5L4W8,"I am in my 2nd trimester and I really like this workout DVD - I just did it this morning, for the 3rd time overall.  It has three 6-minutes circuits to get your heart rate up.  During this time you are doing some cardio and toning with weights.  There is a lower body toning section that is pretty intense (and I am a regular exerciser).  I still can't do the ""toe up side leg lifts""!  That really targets the butt muscles, and I'm hoping to work up to doing them.  There is a short stretching segment at the end, which I wish was a little longer - I also wish the warm up was a little longer.  But all in all, I like Tracey Mallett a lot - she has great cuing for each upcoming move and her attitude is fun and friendly.  She is not pregnant, but she has a girlfriend (specific to each trimester) who is working out alongside her.  I feel like I've targeted my entire body after this workout and I feel refreshed, pumped-up and happy that I'm doing something good for myself and my baby.",1277337600,4,988,4.157894736842105
3955566,5,B002N5L4W8,I received this DVD as a gift from a good friend and I feel sooo good after working out every time I put it in. I started using this during my third trimester and the techniques are very doable and has toned my arms and strengthen my pelvic floor and legs. Being strong down there is very important during birth and I will keep working out until I give birth :-) So buy it now!,1276732800,,377,4.04
3955567,3,B002N5L4W8,"I tried this product during my second trimester and didn't like it.  It was too simple and repetitive for me.  I would maybe benefit more if I tried again during my third trimester when I have no energy. Nevertheless, I really like Tracy Mallet.  I will be using her 6 minute DVDs for returning back to my pre-pregnancy weight after the delivery.",1276473600,,346,4.548387096774194
8374699,5,B002N5L4W8,"This is a wonderful Tracy Mallett addition to my collection. I'm  a big fan of hers and trusted her judgement. I feel safe, encouraged, and my heat rate goes up just the right amount.  Thanks for another great workout!",1470355200,,218,4.564102564102564
8374700,5,B002N5L4W8,This DVD has alterations for every trimester/fitness level. I really enjoy her workouts. They are great and challenging! You can fit them in to a crazy day as well!,1388016000,,164,4.689655172413793
8374701,5,B002N5L4W8,Although this there is no crazy intense cardio by any means i do feel that the blend of cardio and weights gives me a well rounded workout. I also LOVE that there is a countdown per workout which for some reason is super motivating. I think it pushes me to do ALL the workouts EVERYTIME. I feel like when im tired and want to throw in the towel im can look at the time left and i just think keep going only 2 minutes left on this one. Also love that the exercises are shown by trimester.,1363305600,,487,4.030927835051546
8374702,5,B002N5L4W8,"Tracey Mallet does a fantastic job of keeping a calm, yet up-beat, full body workout for us pregnant women. It's a bit easy for someone fit, but still has great stretches and a little cardio too.",1361577600,,195,4.444444444444445
8374703,4,B002N5L4W8,"I already big fun of Tracy Marrett work out DVD so It was really works this one too:)
We don't have enough work out stuff for pragnency woman here in Japan so It is gonna be revolution for Asian woman! lol
I really cannot wait to use another DVD afeter baby barth!",1349308800,,264,4.096153846153846
8374704,5,B002N5L4W8,"This was the best pregnancy work-out video I found. Different work-outs depending on your trimester. Low-impact, but also a little more challenging than most of the other videos I tried. Tracey has a good voice to follow along to. For most work-out videos I have to mute the volume and play music, but I didn't with this one. It was almost sad after I had my baby that I didn't need to do fit for pregnancy anymore.",1335398400,,415,4.402597402597403
8374705,5,B002N5L4W8,"This is by far my favorite pregnancy workout.  I have been in shape my entire life and am an avid hiker, runner, swimmer and also enjoy weight lifting/working out with a trainer.  When I surprisingly found out that I was pregnant with twins, my doctor said because of my activity level, that I could workout, but only low impact workouts where I wouldn't overheat.  This workout actually gives me more energy and helps me keep a positive outlook.  I'm in my third trimester and still using it (I've used it 5 days a week from the beginning of the end of my first trimester), and luckily haven't needed bed rest.  I believe that the simple, targeted exercises have helped me avoid back pain, and my legs have remained strong.  I'm looking forward to trying her Booty Barre DVDs once the babies arrive and I'm cleared for exercise again.",1332201600,,835,4.608108108108108
8374706,4,B002N5L4W8,"This is my second pregnancy, I'm already modestly fit through running and some yoga.  I like this video, and here's why:

Tracy Mallett seems down to earth, and I do not find her chirpy and annoying.  The video itself is broken up into segments, which is annoying in part just because if you want to do a full hour, you have to actually click on the next exercises (past the circuit exercises), but it's not a deal breaker for me. The angles which the instructions are shot with are mostly OK, not annoying, and the production value is modest, but not over-done.  I've definitely gained some upper body strength from this workout, which is a major benefit for me.",1310169600,,663,4.546218487394958
8374707,4,B002N5L4W8,I found this DVD motivating and challenging. The routines are not boring.  It helped contribute to me having a healthy pregnancy and delivery. Plus there's a bonus segment for postpartum exercise.,1303430400,,196,5.32258064516129
8374708,5,B002N5L4W8,"I am on the 2nd trimester of my 1st pregnancy.
Before I was pregnant I was an intermediate exerciser that was used to interval training.
The first thing the doctor stopped me from doing was jumping and that was present in all my workout DVDs because it really burns fat.
I was a bit concerned because the workouts for pregnancy were mainly Pilates and yoga and that's great for me twice a week but not every day.
I think this workout challenging, effective, yet gentle.
This was the nearest I got to what I was used to and is my favorite workout.
It has a decent warm-up, cardio with strength training, a floor segment for belly buns and thighs, and stretch series that helped me very much to prevent back pain.
Cueing right on, I really like Tracey personality and I'm looking forward to try her post pregnancy DVDs.
I can't say much about the 3rd trimester segment because I still haven't tried it.
What I can say it that they use a chair for most exercises it seems overall the same workout as the 1st and 2nd trimester but with modifications.
I certainly recommend this if you wish to prevent excessive weight gain during pregnancy.",1301356800,,1136,4.519417475728155
