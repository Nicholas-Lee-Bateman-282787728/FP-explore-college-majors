4083344,5,B00386EZUY,"I've seen each these movies individually over the years and was very pleased to find them in a 3-pack. I'm not sure if I would have purchased each movie separately, but with all three, it was a no-brainer. Shyamalan is a brilliant director (with only a couple iffy films...) but The Village, Signs and The Sixth Sense were all very well done. Good value for your money.",1299628800,15,369,4.522388059701493
4083345,5,B00386EZUY,"I just had to get this DVD to send my daughter cuz she's a huge M Night Shyamalan fan and this is a secret find -- 3 of his most popular movies in one package.  She was thrilled to get this for xmas.  Do yourself a favor and check out Sixth Sense.  If you haven't seen it before don't watch all the special things before you see the movie.  Do the same thing for The Village.  You'll understand the cleverness of this director when you hear the explanation.  I just love movies with a twist -- these aren't bloody, gory things either -- suspenseful yes!",1294012800,5,553,4.219047619047619
4083346,5,B00386EZUY,"good points:

picture is great
these are very good movies

the bad:
i hate night shalyman's endings and he never does sequels too...",1290211200,4,190,4.4
4083347,5,B00386EZUY,"A great price for these movies; I would have paid as much for either ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""Signs"" alone, so to get them in a bundle was awesome.

4083360,5,B00386EZUY,"You have to love a DVD triple-pack when it has the three best movies a director ever directed.  And that is what we have here.  ""The Sixth Sense"" is legendary, no description needed.  ""Signs"" is actually a pretty tense Alien Invasion yarn with a (rare) charming performance by the deservedly-maligned Mel Gibson -- the ending is a little sentimental, but suits the story.  Last and probably least we have ""The Village"", which begins with a really intriguing premise and ends in eye-rolls, though it's saved by the wonderful humanity of Joaquin Phoenix.",1460592000,,552,4.967391304347826

4083392,5,B00386EZUY,"I love the sixth sense and the village... not so much Signs... but it is worth the few bucks.  The sixth sense is great story about a very adorable little guy who sees and speaks with dead people... the relationship he has with his Mom and Bruce Willis as his therapist... sort of ... The village is a story about a group of ""villagers"" who live simply..without money.. but all is not as it seems.  A great twist. I think these movies are ok for youngsters 10 and older with an adult (?) There is some language, adult themes, scary scenes.",1418342400,2,539,4.326732673267327

4083399,5,B00386EZUY,Excellent deal on a trilogy i love. The sixth sense was awesome (again) as well as SIGNS! Still spooky but not to much for kids. Sixth sense is up to the parents.. It gave me the willies again!,1406592000,,193,4.105263157894737
4083400,5,B00386EZUY,"I love the early Shyamalan movies, they're the only ""scary"" movies I can handle.  They are more story-oriented, with humor and good character development which is so lacking in the gore-porn industry. I hate that he got so much s*** for his work. I'm really tired of people bitching about his cameo roles, its not like its a new concept.

My favorite of these is probably ""Signs"" because it mixes in so much humor. The aliens were pretty scary, I watched this damn thing like, five times before I saw the alien by the chimney and almost crapped myself when I finally did. Joaquin Phoenix was adorable as the dorky ex-jock brother. All the actors were spot on. The alien at the end is starting to look a little dated compared to new computer effects, but that's my only beef.

""Sixth Sense"" has become an internet meme cliche I guess, but its great the first time you see it (provided some douche hasn't already spoiled it for ya).

And when I watched ""The Village"" in theater my bestie and I both ended up in my date's lap whenever the creature is walking toward Bryce Dallas Howard on the porch... And once again Joaquin Phoenix is eye candy. Also, Adrian Brody as a special needs guy was a tear-jerker. Like an attempted-murder-ing ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape.""

Family Guy does make the ""What a twist!"" jokes for a reason, Shyamalan does employ that in all his films, but in all seriousness its done pretty well in ways that, while maybe not all that gasp-worthy, are still at least interesting. Definitely worth watching.

Probably not for the hardcore, gore-and-bouncey-tits lovers. ""Horror-lite"" designation. Suspenseful, but not Liam Neeson suspense.",1402531200,3,1658,4.8
4083401,5,B00386EZUY,"Great Trio!  I had seen all of these movies before, but did not have them...then i saw them offered together!  I was so excited!!  I really enjoy them!  Thank you! :D",1393286400,,166,4.258064516129032
4083402,5,B00386EZUY,I bought this for a Halloween marathon at my house- my teenagers were too young to know these movies and they were as good as I remembered . I ordered with my Amazon Prime and got just in time for Halloween!,1388102400,,207,4.073170731707317
4083403,5,B00386EZUY,Classic movies.  I bought this set b/c my kids had never seen the Sixth Sense but they are all great.,1386633600,,101,4.05
4083404,5,B00386EZUY,"The seller didn't publish any details on this 3-pack, so I figured I'd try to help.

This is based on my 3-pack, so I can't guarantee all are the same:

You get 3 separate discs, one for each movie...all in the one case:

The Sixth Sense:
Widescreen; PG-13; Surround Sound/Dolby Digital; French Language track; Digitally Mastered; Canadian Rating: 14A;
Region 1; *

Signs:
Widescreen; PG-13; Surround Sound/Dolby Digital; Digitally Mastered; THX-certified; Canada Rating: PG; French Language Track; Region: 1; *

The Village:
Widescreen; PG-13; THX-Certified including THX optimizer; Dolby Digital 5.1 EX Surround Sound; Enhanced for 16x9 TV; French Language Track; Canadian Rating: PG; Digitally Mastered; Region 1; *

Concerning all 3 discs:
*Some content on these discs may not be subtitled; some players may not be able to access all features; Dual-layer format: layer transition may trigger a slight pause.

None of the ones I received were Blue-Ray.

Personal note: I love The Sixth Sense and The Village (and Unbreakable, not included here) most of all Shyamalan films, but can recommend them all (including Devil, for which he just wrote the screenplay).  The thing I don't love is when sellers don't give you the info on what you're buying, which is far too common on Amazon.  Hope this helps!",1375574400,38,1302,5.1571428571428575
4083405,5,B00386EZUY,Three terrific movies at a wonderful price.  What more do I need to say?  We have enjoyed watching all of them.,1372377600,,111,4.238095238095238
4083406,5,B00386EZUY,"All three are great stories!!  I can't believe I was able to get ALL THREE in one shot!!  Well worth the $$$!!  Another good one of this director's work is ""Unbreakable"" with Bruce Willis in it, as well.  The only drawback with ""Unbreakable"" is that while overall the film is well paced, the ending seems rushed, as if another ten or fifteen minutes & they could have filled it out better,gaining It more meaning & punch.  But, back to these three-in-one, a great buy!!",1370995200,,469,4.535714285714286
4083407,5,B00386EZUY,"This was a gift but I've seen all 3 movies.  I love Sixth Sense.  One of the best movies ever.  The cleverness of setting up the plot was remarkable.  Many of the scenes are still scary to watch.  The ending is one of the most touching moments I've seen in movies.  It makes me cry every time.
Signs is also dynamite.  I loved the settings and atmosphere through the entire movie.  The dialogue was very clever and entertaining.  Their acting was just superb.  Some may think a couple scenes are hokey--(seeing the movie you'll know what I mean), but I didn't.  There was lots of suspense and drama weaving in and out of the plot to keep things very interesting.
The Village is somewhat slow.  It's an o.k. movie, but wouldn't watch it a 2nd time.  The premise is very interesting, a bit suspenseful and the conclusion surprising.  Don't give up watching it, see it through the end.",1362268800,,882,4.5
4083408,4,B00386EZUY,Three great movies all together at a great price. If you like suspense you like this suprise endings! Good Find,1359936000,,111,4.6

4083411,5,B00386EZUY,"I loved all three movies, but I wish the collection had included ""UNBREAKABLE"", which I always regarded as sort of a sequel to ""THE SIXTH SENSE"" (but, maybe because I originally saw those two movies in that order).",1357344000,,214,4.657894736842105

4083415,5,B00386EZUY,"Though I really enjoy only two of these movies, it was a better deal to buy it this way.  I actually bought this so I could show The Village to a class and do a comparison/contrast with a novel we had read.

8391075,4,B00386EZUY,"The story line and acting in The Sixth Sense was great.  Signs story line was terribly disappointing.  I have historically loved the acting of Mel Gibson.
