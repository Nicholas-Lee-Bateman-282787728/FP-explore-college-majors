2404926,5,B000B7QCR2,"This is the final box set of garfield and friends and like the other four volumes available it delivers. Included here are episodes that haven't been broadcasted in roughly 10 years. Just a taste of what to expect is a sequel to the picnic panic on volume 4, The garfield tin pan alley review, A few episodes with Penelope and some stand out U.S. Acres cartoons including Grape expectations a 2 part cartoon in which Roy faces the music by the big cock-a-doo due to the disappearance of a single grape. All in all if you love the series you will of course enjoy this final volume.

There is one major gripe however. The series final theme song which was a rap is not included in the episodes or anywhere on the dvd's. Decent extras are once again absent. I would have loved to have heard commentary from the remaining castmembers, writers or directors on their take of the show. Still these issues aside, you can't go wrong. The perfect end to the perfect series.",1135036800,2,963,4.502857142857143
2404927,5,B000B7QCR2,What can you say. I didn't miss this show when I was in school. This show is a classic in every way. I of course have collected the prevoius volumes. this one features the last 9 episodes of season 6 and all season 7. A very good plus for me is that it fetures the spanish audio from the latin american version. Now those episodes that couldn't be seen on syndication ( that would be all of 'em in this volume) will be watched and enjoyed by all. Makes a great christmas present for all.,1126656000,3,487,4.136842105263158
2404928,5,B000B7QCR2,"Since the first Garfield & Friends Volume, I have been anxiously awaiting the remaining 4 Volumes to make the 121 Episodes complete!  On here you will find 97-121, for an episode guide please view my review of Volume 4 for the web link since it keeps getting 'deleted' on this review???

scroll down to see which shows this includes.  The 'final' garfield intro song will start somewhere in here (probably just for season 7 I imagine...episodes 106+) possibly in the final few episodes as back when this was on TV regularly, the final theme song (""He's fat and he's lazy..."" rap-like theme)appeared what seemed weeks before the show went off the air.

I am quite excited as none of the upcoming episodes stand out in my memory so it will all be basically new to me.

Those who have not yet got Volume 4...that one is a Roit, I am still cracking up over some of them shows...check em out!",1126051200,11,887,4.51875
2404929,4,B000B7QCR2,"I haven't watched this show since I was 8, but I think everyone who watched this show will agree that its greatest moment was the Ants Song.  This season has that episode.  And for that one reason alone you should get this set.  It's worth it.  That song is not available anywhere on the internet.  This is your only way to get it.",1125705600,6,331,4.190476190476191
2404930,5,B000B7QCR2,"Great series, I loved watching it growing up as a kid. As far as the DVDS goes what is this stupid overpriced crap at almost $100 per volume? All 5 five volumes should be available at a reasonable price for about $20 each, stop trying to rip people off who want the DVDS!",1415059200,,271,4.132075471698113
2404931,5,B000B7QCR2,"One of the best cartoons ever IMO.  I grew up on this show, and the dvd's are all great.  The chapter breaks are between mini-episodes, so it's very convenient to click through episodes looking for the mini you want to watch.  Really nothing to complain about in these dvd's, and I can't think of anything more I'd ask for (other than not having the FBI warning and all that crap you can't skip through at the beginning)",1400630400,,420,4.428571428571429
2404932,5,B000B7QCR2,"I bought the whole series for my adult son's birthday, as he had such fond memories of these Garfield cartoons from his childhood.  He has been enjoying watching and reminiscing on what he calls ""probably the most wholesome cartoons ever aired on TV!""",1392076800,,251,4.837209302325581
2404933,3,B000B7QCR2,"This is the final season of Garfield and Friends.  I was disappointed that the final shows are not as imaginative and fun as the earlier shows.  Several episodes include aliens and monsters, something that really doesn't match up with the theme of earlier shows, and doesn't reflect the humor that Garfield had in the past.  Several of the ""plot lines"" were repetitive, as if the writters had run out of ideas.  This season is ok, but I would recommend spending your money on one of the four earlier seasons if you want a good laugh.",1384732800,,533,4.578947368421052
2404934,5,B000B7QCR2,"Since DVDs will have gone the way of the recordplayer by the time this volume is put out in downloadable format (Seasons 1&2 are only just out now...), I highly recommend picking up Volume Five of Garfield & Friends. While Binky the Clown doesn't appear in this set (yes, this means no Screaming With Binky mini-cartoons), nobody complains much. Also gone are a number of the early characters- Cactus Jake, Ralph Mouse & his incessant Have Me On The Show More Often whining...so this isn't really a bad thing.  Most of Victoria Jackson's appearances as ""Penelope""- Davis' inexplicable substitute for Arlene in the G&F show- are on this set, as are great moments in Garfield cartooning like ""Sit On It"", a Barney knock-off and ""The Legend of Johnny Ragweedseed"". Great conclusion to a great show- and vastly superior to the awful French-designed ""Garfield Show"" now plaguing discount racks near you.",1374537600,,898,4.986666666666666
2404935,5,B000B7QCR2,I bought this volume as well as volume 4. It came to me like new and arrived ealier than expected. If your a fan of Garfield and enjoyed the show in the late 80's and early 90's this is a must have to add to your collection,1355702400,,223,3.765957446808511

2404937,4,B000B7QCR2,"...This is a great set.

I loved this show when I saw it on CBS in 1995(as a rerun); it might be their best season.  One of my favorite Garfield episodes of all time, Top Ten, is on here(Top 10 reasons Jon's dates don't last long will have you on the floor), as well as a favorite US Acres toon, with the twisted fairy tales.

The only things I didn't like are how they changed ""US Acres"" to ""Orson's Farm"", and how they didn't use the actual season 7 opening which I was hoping to get(apparently I was supposed to hate it according to some guy on youtube).  Either it was because such a fanbase hated it so much the company went with the usual syndicated opening, or they couldn't get the rights from whoever sang it or whatever.

Please don't let that stop you from getting this, the cartoons are just as good as they've always been.",1282694400,,835,4.2594936708860756
2404938,5,B000B7QCR2,I love the Garfield & Friends series.  I own all 6 series and watch them all the time.  They are classics in my opinion.,1251417600,,120,3.9583333333333335
2404939,1,B000B7QCR2,"The same situation here, I buy this DVD on may 30, and I haven't received my order, I wrote an e-mail to the company about my situation but no one has gotten in contact with me. I would like to know the status of my order. Please pass this message to how may concern. I want my DVD.
Thank you.",1246320000,,293,3.9
2404940,5,B000B7QCR2,"A must for all the Garfield lovers, both and new.  Who can resist Garfield?  One of the best cartoons of all time.",1221955200,,114,4.136363636363637
2404941,4,B000B7QCR2,The Garfield was a great show that I never saw as a child because no one carried it.  So seeing it on DVD was a real treat and it is a must see for any Garfield fan.,1210377600,,165,3.4594594594594597
2404942,5,B000B7QCR2,"Jim Davis ceases to amaze his fans with his talent and humor through Garfield and his cast of friends. It's just as good as all of the other seasons I've seen. Filled with fun as well as a set you'll return to time and time again. The modern day cartoons just don't measure up to what ""use to be"".",1198627200,,297,4.0508474576271185
2404943,5,B000B7QCR2,"If you love Garfield (and, really, who can resist the lazy, lasagna-eating, sarcastically funny orange guy?) then this is one DVD set you need in your collection. This one is good for hours and hours of enjoyment (and, yes, some of us--especially those of us with kids--actually sit down and press ""play all""). From the hilarious, regular episodes featuring Garfield, Odie, and Jon to the ""And Friends"" part of the show (starring our barnyard pals on the farm), this is the perfect DVD set. Lots of fun regardless of your age--and your viewing preferences.",1179100800,,556,4.925531914893617
2404944,5,B000B7QCR2,i love everyone of the volumes mainly bacause i use to watch garfield and friends every morning before school which is also why i love garfield comics now as an adult!! Thank you jim davis for releasing these on dvd!!,1169337600,,217,4.45
2404945,2,B000B7QCR2,"Don't buy this unless you're a hardcore Garfield cartoon series fan.  Twentieth Century Fox did a sloppy job on this one.  The first disc has a bunch of advertisements in the beginning of it.  The color quality is less than professional you'll notice some bleeding here and there.  For some reason, they changed the name of the ""U.S. Acres"" cartoon segament in the series to ""Orson's Farm"" on each of the episodes but did not update the same names in the episode indexes.  The ""Special Features"" are simply trailers for the movies ""Like Mike 2"" and ""Dr. Dolittle 3"".  It would have been nice if they included in interview with Garfield's creator Jim Davis or some of those who did the voices of the characters.  They could have included a pitch reel or other background stuff but they did not.  At $39.95 for a 3 disc set this was a real let down.",1153180800,3,847,4.490196078431373
2404946,5,B000B7QCR2,Ok This is Garfield and yes some of us sit down and press play all. Thats what days off are for watching Garfield and one or two epesodes just aint enough for me. I have all the volumes and the seperate individual cartoons. In my hous Garfield has its own case for it. Simply put if ya like Garfield get it its worth every penny.,1152835200,3,329,4.076923076923077
2404947,3,B000B7QCR2,"Garfield and Friends premiered on CBS in 1988, and was so popular that in 1989 it went to an hour. Syndicated in 1993, it was rebroadcast on Cartoon Network in 1995. At last, in 2005 and 2006 it found its way to DVD. Good, very good and great. What could be wrong with that?

Merely this. Why do TV DVDs have ""play all"" in the menu? Would you really play an entire season of cartoons in one season? More likely you'd play one a day or one a week or have a crazy marathon session and play two episodes in a row. You'd do that by selecting ""episodes"" in the menu. But to do that you have to get to the menu. And here's the rub. Volume Five starts, right out of the box, with ads for Strawberry Shortcake, Garfield and other DVDs. If I hit the ""Menu"" button on my remote, I get that little circle with a slash through it on the screen, indicating that one may not skip to the menu at this point. This means that I'm treated to the full comport of ads every time before the Menu screen comes up. At least on Disney DVDs you can skip the Leonard Maltin intros after the first time (enlightening as they are) by pressing ""Menu"" on the remote.

I sincerely hope that this is a problem with my DVD player and not with this set. If you're able to skip the ads on your player please write a more positive review. In the meantime I offer as my model of a good DVD set Rocky and Bullwinkle Season Three. Great packaging, easy to navigate, and of course, excellent cartoons. Does the fat cat deserve less?",1148774400,4,1492,4.159169550173011
2404948,5,B000B7QCR2,My daughter is 3 and she just loves Garfield.  She is happy with these shows therefore I am happy with them.  Garfield use to be shown everyday on Disney channel  and then they just out of the blue stopped running them.  That made me mad because my child likes it so much. So I looked on good 'ol Amazon and there they were. All of the Garfield series. So I bought Vol. 5 because it had shows that she had not seen. I like Garfield as well so we did good with purchasing Vol. 5,1144281600,4,477,3.9894736842105263

8082910,5,B000B7QCR2,"If you're wondering about the ""rappy"" theme song for the 7th and last season of Garfield & Friends, many fans will love to hear it's not here due to these episodes being International prints, via U.S. Acres still being renamed Orson's Farm to the very end, and ""We're Ready to Party"" being in every show here. The series ends here with the final 25 shows on a 3-disc set; 8 apiece on every disc of this collection, except the very last disc contains the last 9 shows. What's more, none of these shows have been televised in the USA since they debuted on CBS in 1994, and they're not in the syndicated bunch of shows. What makes this review even more exciting is that this one's my 100th review here on Amazon! What a way to conclude Garfield & Friends; through a toon expert's memories, hence my nickname here! If you've noticed, Binky the clown, Cactus Jake, and the Buddy Bears haven't been in the show for quite a while, to Garfield's enjoyment, until one episode of the final season when Binky tells Garfield he's back in the show, even though that was his last animated appearance. There's a beloved birthday classic in here, and it's not the 1988 special ""Happy Birthday, Garfield"" which remains unavailable on DVD even in 2015; only this time, Garfield tells Jon he wants a 12-course dinner for his birthday, to the tune of the 12 Days of Christmas. Ironically, it was Christmastime in 1994 when the show finally ended, with Garfield saying this quote in the theme: ""For 7 seasons, I've said everything I could possibly think of in this spot."", and this line to conclude the show once and for all: ""I'd rather eat the boat."" There's even a spoof of a certain famous purple dinosaur in here, and it's not Dino from the Flintstones! If you've already collected all 5 volume sets long ago and still have them, be grateful for what you have, since Anderson Digital ain't making any new DVD sets for them, only remastered in HD like the 2D Holiday Collection from 2014. It's hard to believe that the original TMNT series outran Garfield & Friends' famous run on the same channel, CBS, and now both entire series are on DVD now, if you wish to own it too. (The classic TMNT series is in 10 season sets separately and in 1 big collection!) If you don't like Garfield and the TMNT's spin-off series, why not just stick with the originals on DVD? After all, nothing beats a lovingly-made original, and that doesn't just apply to genuine DVDs or any other home video format!",1432684800,2,2471,4.555056179775281
