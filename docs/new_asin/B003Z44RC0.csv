8409917,5,B003Z44RC0,"If you are a fan of classic ECW (1993-2001) This is a must see
It's very interesting Francine was amazing at coming off as the biggest *****
But, she seem like a generally sweet nice human being
It's kind of sad fans never seen the real Francine in ECW
It's very interesting she talks about being picked as Stevie Richards g/f /stalker
her bra and panties match with Beulah,(This might have been the first real gimmicky sex sells type match before WWF)
Being the Manager/valet for the Pitbulls, turning on The Pitbulls and becoming the head cheerleader for Shane Douglas
The heat Shane and herself got after the broken neck incident/angle her relationship with Douglas
(Selling there torrid affair even with the boys in the back)
There's a lot of interesting behind the scenes info, stories during the boom of ECW
If you are a die hard ECW fan it's a very interesting look behind the curtain  8.5/10",1450310400,,899,4.689873417721519
