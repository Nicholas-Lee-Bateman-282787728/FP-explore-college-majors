8271727,5,B00192RY7U,"I watched ""The Tender Trap"" as part of TMC's tribute to the late, great Debbie Reynolds.  It's a sweet little flick, but I found the performances of David Wayne and Celeste Holm superior to those of Reynolds and Frank Sinatra.  Debbie Reynolds was typecast as usual as the sweet ingenue, Sinatra as her selfish playboy boyfriend.  They do their best with their cardboard characters, but Wayne is much more sympathetic and interesting as the probably in a mid-life crisis and happily-married-but-bored vacationing friend.  He shows a heartfelt wisdom in the second half of the film that's moving and charming, and Celeste Holm equally so for the same reasons.

The first half of the movie is bland, but stick around.  It does improve greatly, and how everyone involved winds up in a happy ending is both creative and believable. This is a good date-night or chick flick movie from Hollywood's golden era. Well worth a look.",1485907200,,922,4.916129032258064
