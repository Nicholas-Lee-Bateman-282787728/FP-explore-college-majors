1413941,5,B00005ALOU,"Wow...one of the year's finest.  I love the beautiful scenery and the soundtrack reminds of Herbie Hancock's ""Rockit."" Julie Strain proves herself in this intense thriller to be one of the best.  The Kings of Crap give it two thumbs up. This movie is best watched with pound cake!",1034380800,2,280,4.6938775510204085
1413942,3,B00005ALOU,ok julie strain film. but beware an unrated version with about 15 more minutes is around. try to find that version. the cuts in this movie are evident. just when something steamy is going to occur the movie abruptly cuts to next scene...overall good action.,1030838400,14,257,4.733333333333333
1413943,5,B00005ALOU,One of the better sci-fi movies with Julie Strain in it. The plot is good along with the acting of the cast. Some sexy scenes in the movie to wet the appetite. It is one worth putting in your collection!,1018137600,6,203,4.1
1413944,3,B00005ALOU,"I got this movie because I like Julie Strain movies.
If you like Julie Strain movies then you'll like this movie.
Overall, the most dissapointing part of the movie is that it doesn't have enough action, or Julie Strain kicking butt. And, I would have liked to seen her in a better outfit also. The outfit on the front cover isn't worn in the movie--darn!
The acting was O.K., but needed to be a little better.
The break out star of this movie(DVD) is Eva Dawn Nemeth as Pricilla, but unfortunately she doesn't have enough screen time.
The part that makes this DVD worth getting is the half hour close up of Julie Strain, as she's just plainly interviewed at her house...that's the best part. Julie seems...well at home there.
Maybe she'll do a sequel, and get a better costume, and have some more action in it; that's what I'd like to see.",999648000,15,839,4.490196078431373
1413975,4,B00005ALOU,"I am a big julie strain fan, and if you are then you will want to see this movie.  The plot i not stong and there are alot of holes in this tale of a future earth that was devistated by a comet resulting in a sort of second ice age.  We don't really know how the bad guys came to power or why they want to experiment on the sewer peopl but we do know that Julie is a high class call girl by day and the avengger of the sewer people by night.  This is an above average Sci-Fi B Movie with all the elements, Mad Scientist, Bad guy in love with the heroine and the child that unleashes the maternal instinct of our hero.  There is a fair amount of nudity as is common in this kind of movie but not as much action as one would expect and just not enough Julie.  over all it is a fun watch.",1316563200,2,785,3.791411042944785
1413976,5,B00005ALOU,... for lovers of sexy amazons. Worth watching after a hard day at work !,1168300800,2,73,3.933333333333333
1413977,4,B00005ALOU,"I've said this before, but persons who dislike this kind of campy sci-fi should not review it. I do not review romance movies because it would not be fair to the readers. But I know everyone is trying. This is great camp- as in very good entertaining movie with a beautiful half nude action actress. So, if you've watched Robotrix three times, then you should get or rent this. I did not read anything about this before watching, and I could find no wrong with it at all. Still, it is a very low B movie (which I usually like much), so my rating stands at 4. Definitely not for the over-serious or easily offended. For average movie lovers (who don't appreciate strong camp), consider this film average, but still very entertaining for a one time viewing.",1155427200,3,755,4.518248175182482
1413978,4,B00005ALOU,"I was expecting this movie to be pretty bad when I rented it, but after watching it, It's actually a pretty decent movie! Be advised, that I'm a ""B post-holocost-type-scifi-movie"" junkie. What I didn't expect when I rented it, was that this was the movie that was ALMOST porno.",1126483200,3,277,4.673469387755102
1413979,2,B00005ALOU,"This movie is about a post-apocalyptic world (an asteroid has hit the earth), in which there is the ruling class (consisting of about 5 people) and the ruled class (consisting of about 6 people).

Basically, the whole thing looks like it was filmed in a furniture store.  Julie Strain is a terrible, TERRIBLE actress.  If she has three lines to speak, she'll do the first one with a bored expression, the second one with an angry expression, and the third with a happy expression.  It's impossible not to groan.  She walks around topless a lot, but the whole thing is done in such a sleazy way that it's not the least bit erotic.  And then she speaks some monotone text and any possiblity of sensuality is completely lost.

The plot consists of her being the head madame for the ruling class.  She lounges around at parties and talks like a sleazy madame.  Then she decides she doesn't like her ""john"" any more, so she joins the resistance.  They fight against the rulers, and guess who wins?

This is full of really bad stuff.  If, like me, you look at the cover art and think that this movie couldn't possibly be bad, think again.  Imagine the employees of a strip club making a movie - that's exactly what this is.  Sleazy, not at all sexy, horribly produced, acting that is WAY below even B-movie standards...they couldn't even get the theme music right.  The one person who really steals the show is another member of the stable of females.  She doesn't have any lines, and believe me, in this movie the less you say the better you look in comparison to the rest of the cast.

Avoid at all costs.",1093046400,10,1601,4.503472222222222
1413980,1,B00005ALOU,"The cover-aft of this movie is the best thing about it. No Joke. I threw away the movie after watching it, and kept the cover. The movie wasn't even closed to ""B"" quality (somewhere around ""Z"" if there was such a rating). Most of the outdoor shots are done in very poor lighting, and appear to have been filmed with a normal camcorder (very grainy, and lot's of jerky movement). The acting is somewhere in the relm of; a college project being made for class to out of work ""never been"" actors picked up off the street. Honestly, Julie Strain is the obvious reason anyone would watch this movie. Well, she wasn't in enough scenes. And when she was part of the scene, the quality of the movie, the set, the other actors/actresses, just drug everything down. If you are a Julie Strain fan, there are much better titles out there for you to choose from. If you just have to see this movie, look for it on a $1 day at your local video rental store, cause that's about all I feel it's worth.",1091059200,6,985,4.3297297297297295
1413981,4,B00005ALOU,"Well, well, well. Bad plot:check, Lots of senseless nudity:check, Horrible acting:check, Bad fights:check, Julie Strain: roger we are ready to move out. This may sound like a horrible movie and it is but the dialogue is great. Not great as in good but great as in ""I can't act"". The facial expressions and sheer lack of talent (except Julie) are priceless. Seeing an actor start to laugh as he says his lines with pride is classic in my book. The look on almost everyones face makes it seem like they are lost and unsure of what they are doing. To see people behave in this way is just funny. Kinda like real life.(You do meet some charactors out there.)
But in all seriousness, If you want to relax and watch something thats not complicated then this is about as bad as it gets.",1075852800,4,779,4.454545454545454
1413982,4,B00005ALOU,"First off, I am a huge fan of Julie Strain. She is in my top five hottest women in the world. This movie actually has a plot that isn't to stupid to follow. There is just enough of Julie naked to keep you watching until the plot unfolds and then you might actually care about what's going on in the movie. She is, of course, a bad ... and a babe and in this movie she shows some emotion. Julie is not some bimbo, like Anne Nicole Smith who couldn't act if she had to, it seems like Julie is really trying not to be just another T&A piece. I do want to mention there is nothing wrong with some T&A, the harder the better. If you are a fan of Julie Strain or even action movies then I would Definately look into this movie.",1044230400,3,721,3.9793103448275864
1413983,1,B00005ALOU,"It's hard to beat PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, but this super turkey comes close. Pure garbage. Even Julie Strain's enormous assets (none of them related to talent) cannot keep the adult viewer's attention for more than a microsecond (teenage boys may be exempt from this). The budget is non-existant. The same sets are used again and again and again, and look more like poorly made high school drama backgrounds than anything approaching real. Yes, Julie is repeatedly nekkid, but she has no acting ability whatsoever, and it is painful to watch her and all the actors struggle through something more resembling trash can refuse than a screenplay. Hopelessly, impossibly bad. And yes, not a single ""battle queen"" to be seen anywhere! Watch at your own peril!",1034553600,6,758,4.9763779527559056

7935474,3,B00005ALOU,"The Earth has been hit by an asteroid and has become a two tier society. The Elite take young women and turn them into comfort creatures with Gayle (Julie Strain) being their instructor...but she has not forgotten her underground low tier roots or family who she sneaks food.

If you have ever seen a Julie Strain movie before, you know what to expect: Poorly choreographed scenes, a bathing scene, a sex scene, and a Julie Strain interview extra where we see her modest home. She now has a maid as it looks like her kid sister has moved out. As a film, the plot is closer to soft core production than an action SF movie.

Film has sex and nudity. Julie looks like her augmentations had augmentations. Minor full frontal. Plus a lot of silicon extras.

7935478,2,B00005ALOU,"About 15 minutes gets edited out for this DVD, and I'm not sure what we missed out on, but I don't think it would have changed my mind about ""Battle Queen 2020.""  Julie Strain was actually in decent shape physically - for her age, when this film was made.  Same goes for Eva Nemeth, the other alleged starlet of this feature.  The premise is a meteor strikes earth, destroys over 90% of the people, causes a nuclear winter and most of the ones left live underground.  A few privileged people live above ground in limited accommodations, called the ""elite.""  The elite get to have the finest things in life, best food, the warmest environment, and the most beautiful women.  Julie Strain is the obvious favorite, and predominates this picture way too lopsidedly.  Prostitution and exploitation of women abounds, and the narration, the acting, and the sets leave the female nudity to carry this film, but for that genre, this time it falls short.  Think of this as a softcore film but with even less story line, and with 5% of the anticipated softcore.  Rated R, filmed in Timmins, Ontario, Canada, released in 2001.  Brigitte Nielsen was considered for the lead actress role, and THAT may have made this film float.  She wasn't in it.  2 stars for the scenery, nothing, for everything else.",1332979200,2,1289,4.7309417040358746
