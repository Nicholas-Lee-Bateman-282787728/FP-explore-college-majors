7925709,2,B00004WMD1,"I purchased the order, but I thought it was a very poor example of the talents of Latinos. I am African American, this movie Is basically the Stepin Fechit  version of the Latino Community. No Jimmy Smits, Selena, Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony, Benjamin Bratt, Mario Lanza was mentioned, but he was made to look like a buffoon. I wouldn't recommend it.",1390694400,,351,4.754098360655738
7925710,5,B00004WMD1,"his book is great not only as Hollywood Book, but as a book of History and Sociology. Of course is not a dull academic work, but we see the prejudices, the problems and alsi the victories of people like Rita Haiworth.",1380672000,,217,4.317073170731708

7925713,3,B00004WMD1,"Likewise with Carmen Miranda... She was not ""hispanic"" (of Spanish descent) but rather born in Portugal and raised in Brazil.  How ironic that a collection that seeks to highlight Latin American contributions to Hollywood should so casually fumble over the most basic ethnic terminology.  Oh, well.",1213056000,3,298,5.456521739130435
7925714,3,B00004WMD1,"Gives a good overview of Latin Americans in film, especially during Hollywood's golden era. Worth seeing just for the movie footage/scenes from certain films.  Notable also for a huge, glaring ERROR.  U.S. actress Dorothy Lamour was NOT ""Hispanic"".  Whoever did the research for this production was incredibly poor. Versions of her bio are all over the Internet, for goodness sake! Her ""real"" name was never mentioned in the DVD, nor the city or state where she was born.",1117065600,3,471,5.012820512820513
7925715,3,B00004WMD1,"This 100-minute documentary discussed actors and actresses of Latin American and SPANISH descent in the US's Hollywood.  It's a long ""who's who?"" that gets exhaustive at points.  However, it clearly demonstrates that Latinos are not just a new presence but have always been on the screen.  Two things stand out.  First, this movie mentions all the Latino actors that fled Hollywood for Mexico, fled the stage to go behind the camera, or fled film and returned to theater in order to escape from limited or stereotypical movie roles.  Secondly, it mentions MANY actors and actresses that have committed suicide or were tragically killed to show that fame is not all fun and glory.  Surprisingly, the film focuses much more on the 1920s and 1930s than the 1980s and 1990s.  I liked ""The Bronze Screen"" much better than this documentary.  Here, there were so many old film clips, movie stills, and old interviews of actors that the whole work felt old and pieced together.  The film includes Quincy Jones and Reverend Jackson for a touch of person-of-color unity.  There is one Latino scholar that says a lot on Latinos in modern society and almost nothing about them in film, so his presence is odd.  They interview one Afro-Latino academic, but otherwise the absence of Afro-Latinos in film is barely brought up.  It is great how the film illustrates that American history affected how Latinos were portrayed on the screen.  Still, there was something about this documentary that felt a little amateurish.  I wonder if it were made for TV.",1077321600,9,1538,4.910852713178294
