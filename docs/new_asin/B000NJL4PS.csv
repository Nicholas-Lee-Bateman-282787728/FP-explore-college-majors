8178389,5,B000NJL4PS,"Pride Legacy 4 is a 5-DVD set featuring Pride FC 17-18 and 20-22. For those used to American MMA, Pride presented a unique brand of Mixed Martial Arts with different sets of rules, judging, and round structures. The Japanese crowd was unusually quiet and respectful during a match. This period of Pride saw the growing career of some contemporary stars such as Fedor, Wanderlie, Rampage, and Anderson Silva.

Each disc has its own Special Features, these include 'Photo Gallery', 'Fighter Bios', 'Rules', 'What is Pride FC?'. Some of these are repeats from earlier discs. For Pride 20, Rampage does a special voice-over commentary for his match being a clown as usual. Terrific set showcasing Pride during an era when it rivaled the UFC.",1306281600,8,2180,5.3226744186046515

8178392,4,B000NJL4PS,"This is a nice collection of Pride events from 2001-2002.  Included in the collection are Pride 17--Championship Chaos 11/3/01, Pride 18--Cold Fury 2 12/23/01, Pride 20--Armed and Ready 4/28/02, Pride 21--Demolition 6/23/02, and Pride 22--Beasts from the East 2 9/29/02.  All these events took place in Japan.  Missing from this is Pride 19--Bad Blood 2/24/02 and Pride Shockwave 2002 8/28/02.  I can understand Bad Blood being left out since it was released as a 2 disc special edition.  Shockwave 2002 has never been released in the US on dvd as far as I can tell.  Shockwave, Total Elimination, and Final Conflict were always the really big shows for the now defunct Pride FC so I can see why they would want to release them on their own, but Pride is dropping the ball by not even releasing the event at all.  These Legacy sets are terrific for fans wanted to collect Pride events, but they are making things confusing when they don't have to.  Now that the UFC owns the library you may see the catalog released in chronological order.  Really some great events here with many fighters you are seeing pop up at the UFC recently.  Henderson, Jackson, A. Silva, Herring, Nogueria, V. Silva, and hopefully one day Feder.",1191024000,5,1221,4.771428571428571
8178393,5,B000NJL4PS,"This dvd set is really worth the money!
I have watched all of the Pride Legacy series so far and i think this is the best.
There are some great fights, one of Rampage Jacksons slams has amazing results.....watch out for it.

Go ahead and get it I don't think you'll be displeased with it at all.",1184716800,,295,4.175438596491228
8178394,5,B000NJL4PS,"If you have seen the earlier Pride Legacy dvds then you will see this as a continuing step towards the great pride events of today.  Many of the early Pride events had great matches but are not even close to being great events.  Today, the MMA fan wants excitement and a variety of styles and personalities.  This volume of Legacy has all of those and not just for one match per event but for almost the whole events.  Some of the discs are better than others but everything is good.  If you do not have any Legacy sets than this is where you should start collecting old events.  Then move backwards till it gets too boring for you to stand and dismiss any event past that threshold. But I highly recommend this one.",1182902400,3,716,4.345864661654136
