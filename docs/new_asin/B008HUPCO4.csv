5165464,5,B008HUPCO4,Movie starts slowly evolving to a crescendo with music that inspires suspense and fear until the zombie-like takeover is complete. Great cinematography and angle shots to create suspense and build the characters internal strife. Main characters are young fresh and believable.,1352764800,2,276,5.7560975609756095
5165465,1,B008HUPCO4,This movie had a good idea but poor execution. The movie starts slow and really doesn't build any momentum. The acting is subpar and the story doesn't make alot of sense. The characters acted like no normal person would. I wasted my money buying a movie I would't watch on tv. Avoid at all cost.,1352764800,2,295,4.381818181818182

5165480,5,B008HUPCO4,"I am not connected to this movie in any way, and while it may not be the pinnacle of horror ( go to "" The Canal"" a recent release from Ireland for  that accolade possibility)  ""From Beneath"" is everything previous reviewers have stated  and more. Yes the actors and director may be expanding on a film made for a film/theater class, school final, but I am standing behind it...a combination factors make it worthy...it is not stupid as some claim (go to our friend and trailblazing hero ED WOOD for that)...it is an errant psychological thriller... ARTLESSLY EFFECTIVE,... gruesome and noteworthy as such, for me it carries a GENIUS/AWKWARD/SURREALIST label and if you were once semi intelligent and understand the real definition of surrealism watch for free with (car accident brain damage will certainly be helpful) open mind ,Dal Lazlo said "" it appears there is something going on here... something very, very objectionable is happening here"".

5165510,1,B008HUPCO4,"Wow, where to even start.

The dialog is extremely canned and often read just as if off a sheet of paper and with poor timing. Ever so often, after some mock arguing, one of the characters will look at the other and just say ""I love you"" out of nowhere. Ultra-campy synth keys will play and they'll kiss. These scenes are so robotic and without feeling they reaches uncanny valley levels.

The music is sometimes OK, if a little canned, but aside from the terrible synth piano, there is also this irritating guitar strum that permeates the movie. We get it. Your friend's rock band told you they could totally do the music for your movie.

The decisions make are laughable at best, including just wandering around strange property of a relative without them being home and going swimming for approximately a minute in a small pond whose water quality is unknown and hidden so far back in the property that it may not even belong to Sam's sister. After this, when Jason's leg gets a parasite in it and looks gruesome and infected with striking black lines along his arteries from the second day, their plan mostly involves sleeping and gently bickering while making no attempt to get Jason any real medical help. Indeed, the majority of the movie is filmed in the yard of the house and in the living room as the two alternatively attempt to brew contrived suspense and sleep. Yes, this movie has a lot of sleeping. other gems include sleeping in a house with a corpse, again, while making little effort to get help, running into a dead-end basement to escape a pursuer, and later hiding in another enclosed outdoor shed to again escape the same pursuer who easily traps the victim there.

It also suffers from some of the worst horror movie clichs of all time, including, dead phones, a mysteriously breaking car, and everything being explain by the use of secret government/evil corporation experimental toxic chemicals. Although the movie half-heartedly attempts to explain some of these problems, it's underwhelming. Mixed in for good measure are irritating inconsistencies in the writing, such as the varying degrees of Jason's aversion to light as he transforms. Sometimes the sun just irritates him. Sometimes a simple 40w bulb will burn him. However, another room and hallway lit with a 40w bulb, moonlight, and outdoor floodlights do nothing to him later, while a flashlight still burns his skin and causes him a great deal of pain. At some point, after Sam has burned Jason with light from a light bulb and sees him his skin cook, she has a meaningless series of flashbacks linked together in which she pieces together that Jason is sensitive to light. The point of this is beyond me. There is also the fact that although Sam's sister's entire family never left, they leave behind no vehicle, leading me to wonder how they even moved into the house in the first place.

There is a twist ending of sorts, but in order to explain why the ending is so bad I need to revisit the classic twist. A great twist ending is usually an ending which is hinted at by subtle but very easily overlooked clues in the story that encourage a re-watch to spot. An at least OK twist ending in a horror movie may provide a cheap jump scare. This ending is less of a twist and more of a non-sequitur that has little to no context in the scope of the movie. In fact, based on what we see during the film, it doesn't even seem possible and the last scene left me more skeptical and confused than anything else.

The only thing from beneath about this movie is the genuinely interesting idea, which is buried under poor writing, bad camera work, and a greasy film of low-budget, standard definition messiness. Lauren Watson, based on her other castings, seems to be a fairly competent actress, so maybe she just got a raw deal. I would have liked to see more emphasis on Jason's infestation and a payoff shots of the creature, but as it stands now, it's not worth the time.",1391558400,3,3956,4.63623395149786
5165511,1,B008HUPCO4,"It was boring, The acting was very poor. I was very disappointed. It wasn't even a thriller.

5165512,1,B008HUPCO4,The move is so awful I didn't get through the first quarter of it. Why? Because the acting was horrible. Can't blame them when they're doing their job right? So I'll blame the writer for this. The dialogue between the couple on top of what you should do when your boyfriend has a parasite burrowing inside his leg is unbelievably callous. Don't waste your time people.,1383264000,3,368,4.590909090909091
5165513,1,B008HUPCO4,"I have just read several reviews on this film, in reading you would think that they were two seperate films. First the acting if you could call it that well,it  sounds like the drivel they are spouting was written by someone with a disabillity and the two people in the film reading the lines like they were doing it off cue cards. I won't spoil a bad watch by revealing to much as why should I be one of the ones to suffer this horror of a movie (not horror movie)there was one saving grace with my copy and that was that it froze at the 52 min mark and saved me wasting anymore time on it. There are just so many rediculas things happenening in this movie it goes into my top ten stinkers for the year with ones such as the Mooring and Snowshark and many more the movie didn't cost an arm and a leg so with all the drama concerned with posting it back from overseas I won't bother so what happens (and I don't realy care) to these poor souls will reamain a mystery as will the reason to finance this mess is.

5165514,2,B008HUPCO4,"This was on par with the usual amateur offerings.  The photography was a bit better but the plot, acting and effects mundane.  If you have nothing else to watch go for a walk instead.",1374883200,,183,4.352941176470588

The actors can't act, at all. They read and act like robots.

The soundtrack is AWFUL. It's not atmospheric, it never fits the mood, and it's just plain annoying. It's literally noise just droning on and on.",1373760000,2,295,4.584905660377358

5165529,2,B008HUPCO4,"Whether intentional or not, From Beneath (2012) is reminiscent of a really badly made horror film from the 1970's.  The story is weak, the acting is poor, the dialog is terrible, and image quality is not very good.  As the characters continue to do ridiculous things, time loses meaning, in this very slowly paced tale.  It soon becomes clear, that anyone expecting a decent story will be sorely disappointed.  (Some spoilers follow)

Jason (Jaime Temple) and his girlfriend Sam (Lauren Watson), arrive at Sam's sister's house, located in an isolated area in British Columbia.  No one seems to be at home, so the couple goes for a swim in a small pond, where some kind of wormlike creature enters Jason's leg.  Through an unlikely chain of events, the couple is unable to call for help, and wind up staying at the house for days, as the injured Jason's condition continues to worsen.

While it may be a major personal accomplishment for writer and director David Doucette, to have made something out of so very little, unfortunately for horror fans, his first feature film offers little in the way of quality.  The passage of time comes to have no meaning, as Sam and Jason drift along, in a series of disconnected scenes.  Saying the most absurd things, the couple are neither believable nor likeable, and just seem incredibly inept.  Some suspense is occasionally generated, but usually dissipates quickly, as the loss of either character, would essentially end the film.  When one of the characters does finally perish, matters do quickly conclude, and in a rather predictable way.

Even Prime members who can see From Beneath for free, may still feel cheated by very disappointing effort.  A two star rating might be too generous.  Unless you are personally connected with this movie, there are probably much better ways to spend your time.",1365638400,3,1844,4.903225806451613

5165533,5,B008HUPCO4,"Movie starts slow. Real slow but it gets much better as it goes along. Good story line, although not great material for the actors. Both actors did a great job with what they had to work with. The film had potential to be really good, unfortunately the budget just wasn't there for it. Again the team did a great job for what they had to work with. The cinematography was great and the scoring of the film was very fitting for the film. The special effects make up was terrible. Lauren Watson carried the film. I would've like to have seen more of the ""monster"" and would like to see both actors again in roles with stronger material to showcase their talent. Overall a great little indie flick.",1355443200,4,695,4.4375
5165534,5,B008HUPCO4,"The beautiful & Talented Lauren Watson made the entire film. She has such a star quality that you can't take your eyes off of her & her natural talent was undeniable !  I look forward to seeing many more films with her in it!  I felt Jamie Temple was slightly ""uncommitted"" in his performance & very difficult to hear at times. I may have gone in a different direction in terms of a lead actor.  The cinematography was top-notch & I really enjoyed the effects for the ending lake-scene.  A very strong showing for an Indy horror film !",1353888000,4,535,4.373737373737374
