8532222,5,B008XKTUJQ,"I love how it was narrated, the scenery and the background music is just beautiful....

May the holy Cross be my light,
Let not the dragon be my guide.

Begone, Satan!
Suggest not vain things to me.
Evil is the cup thou offerest;
Drink thou thine own poison.

May his presence protect us in the hour of our death.

Amen",1362096000,2,319,4.266666666666667
