1903200,1,B0000A7W10,"It's some sort of evil, right-wing, Bizarro Dennis Miller from a parallel universe.
What happened to the guy who used to think independently? who is this republican shill?
Where's the guy who used to talk politics on his show with Tim Robbins? the guy who called George W. Bush 'insipid""? the guy who lambasted McCain for endorsing Bush? the guy who wrote a beautiful piece in his book 'the rants' calling for a return of true liberalism?
the guy who used to actually be funny?
Never in my life have I seen someone do such a 180 overnight to keep a sagging career alive. And what did it get him? He plays second banana to Sean Hannity.
Dennis should be ashamed for dumbing himself down to appeal to the fringe right. Anti-french jokes? Calling for people to beat up antiwar activists?
He's become as fake as his bad hairplugs
The Real Dennis Miller R.I.P.
1953-2002",1071100800,20,865,4.587096774193548
1903201,1,B0000A7W10,"Is there truly anything as sad ( and equally pathetic! ) as a stand-up comic who misguidedly believes he has something of true relevance to say? Dennis Miller, in an astonishingly desperate attempt to revive a somewhat flagging career, now fancies himself as a comic in the vein of the brilliant Lenny Bruce or Mort Sahl. Though, and equally as sadly, a stand-up comedian whose asperations seem to far outdistance his somewhat limited talents. And after being subjected to "" Raw Feed "" I've come to the conclusion that this is a performer whose fifteen minutes of fame have decidedly come to an end.
Swaggering out on stage to, not one mind you, but 'TWO'  ovations ( before Mr. Miller had even utterted a single syllable! ) tells me that this Chicago audience was more then just simply enamored with this entertainers less then remarkable talents. And with laughter that seemed almost Pavlovian in nature one would think that the audience had been 'packed' with friends or relatives of Dennis Miller's thereby awarding him with gracious applause and laughter that was bestowed upon this entertainer. All by virtue of simply showing up for work! Well, I will say that whomever 'primped' this audience beforehand certainly deserved their very own HBO special.
Regarding Mr. Miller's monologues it becomes painfully obvious that as a stand-up comic he commits the ultimate 'sin' when performing his craft. Simply put... Dennis Miller is painfully "" not very funny! "" Its one thing to be pretentious and aspire to 'say something' in your routine but its simply something far worse when you sacrifice any real humour in hopes of being relevant and ascerbic. Dennis comes across, for the most part, as an odd mixture of Bill O'Reilly's pomposity and CNN's in-house crumudgeon Jack Cafferty! Taking his cue from the far-Right Mr. Miller's not-so-unique observations concerning the Middle East, the French ( who Dennis seems to truly loathe! ), the upcoming war with Iraq, Saddam Hussein and finally the old stand-by religion grow increasingly tiresome and ultimately I found myself weary of a routine that centered around this comedians almost pathological need to prove himself as an entertainer who was intellectual enough to speak of current events. Although the more he spoke of todays issues, sadly, the more he proved himself who seemed clueless as to showing any intellectual acumen, much less understanding of todays complex problems.  Of course through out his monologue Dennis Miller constantly tries to drop references to popular culture icons. All done in a cheap attempt to show how incredibly savvy and 'hip' he misguidedly believes he is. Add to this unfortunate mixture a seemingly endless amount of cockiness and sarcasm that permeates his 'routine' and it makes for one truly bizarre evening.
Ultimately, I found many of Mr. Miller's remarks/observations to be remarkably harsh and unfeeling... with little true humour to be found. But if your idea of real knee-slapping humour is your local morning radio 'shock-jock' then Dennis Miller is certainly your man! Its truly sad to see a performer whose resume includes working on "" SNL "" and one who had his very own HBO program resort to this contrived and truly desperate self-styled aggrandizement. Very uncomfortable indeed! Well, in an obvious attempt to find his audience I suggest that Mr. Miller look no further then his local chapter of the RNC! No doubt many of those on the far-Right will be amused by this performers endless 'witticisms' and less then sterling thoughts on todays current events. Can it be long before Mr. Miller has is very own far-Right radio talk-show?",1070496000,14,3642,5.058236272878536
1903202,1,B0000A7W10,"a formerly intelligent, funny comedian who deals with career death by dumbing ican politics overnight, blindly sucking up to power, advocating nuking civillians, and spewing racism while appearing on Leno nearly every night

1903203,5,B0000A7W10,"Wow. Until his recent comments about the various states of the world at large on Jay Leno, the news and print, I knew him only from Saturday Night Live and Joe Dirt (I realize it's an abomination of a movie but it does have Christopher Walken). Upon reading about his various quips relating to the world today and various entertainers and celebrities constant whining, I knew I had to see his act.
Dennis Miller is a rare breed of entertainer. He talks to you, not at you. He doesn't espouse slogans and chants, he speaks with clarity, reason and incredible wit. Even when he's not particularly funny, he speaks with the mind of someone who; at the very least, is incredibly observant. He completely brushes aside the agendas of the whiny left and the argumentative right and breaks it all down the middle with common sense. He leans in neither direction but instead steps back and views the world from an objective stand point and even when you disagree with him, you still hang on every word because he speaks like someone who thinks constructively and free of the sheepishness of a good number of people. And, to top it all off, he is very funny.
What can I say... I'm sold.",1063670400,27,1177,4.556603773584905

A sense of humor is the ability to laugh at yourself, especially when others make the observation.

The humor here is thoughtful, frank and intelligent.  So much so that when Miller goes for the cheap laugh it ends up going over your head.

1903467,5,B0000A7W10,"What a delightful hour with someone who can be argued as one of the best Humorists/Satirists around today. This DVD was recorded at Miller's performance in Chicago in 2003,and is a joy to listen to today,and loses none of its punch with the passage of the past 5 years. If there ever is a good test of great humor,it has to be time. One of America's greatest humorists has to be Mark Twain and that holds true for him;and I feel Miller's humor is similar, and will likewise be long lasting. As someone who loves history and politics:I would love to see Miller do a show on past politicians such as Harding,Kennedy,Nixon,Carter,Johnson,Truman Lincoln,Grant,Hitler Mao,Stalin,Churchill, and any number of others. To really enjoy political humor one must put their political party prejudices aside to see the real humor--and Miller can do that. I don't think it makes any difference which party wins the upcoming election or any other;Miller's style and insight will find plenty of humor to feed on and entertain us.
 I really wait for and enjoy Miller these days on Fox News. O'Reilly,who is never lost for words,is frequently left speechless,when Miller comes up with his take on things. If you listen to Miller,and just wish you could hear more from him,this DVD will be right down your alley. Though my many years in the Army,Engineering School,and ""misspent youth"" in Pool Halls have hardened my ears to rough language;I would prefer that Miller avoided it. Many stand-up comics today feel they have to sprinkle it through their humor,but I feel it shows a lack of ability;and Miller does,not need it as a crutch. The great comics in the past avoided it,and their humor was better for it.
  Miller is definately a thinking man's comic and his mind takes a subject and works at it as would an artist, and is a master at crafting humor out of it. When you watch him,and you must watch his eyes and expressions;you just know he is loading up a thought that when he comes out with it,is really going to be good,original,funny and above all else --to the point.
 If you enjoy Miller,you'll love this DVD.",1219536000,3,2101,4.763736263736264
1903468,3,B0000A7W10,"Even before his veer to the political right, I was a Dennis Miller fan.  I watched him all the time on SNL when he was a Reagan hater and saw his live show in college while he was firmly planted left of center.  It is refreshing to see an entertainer of any sort that is willing to take up traditionally conservative causes and points of view, and, in Dennis's case, make them funny.

Raw Feed, though, is weak by Miller standards.  Recorded on the eve -- almost literally -- of the Iraq war, Dennis's takes and predictions, five years later, seem...well...uninformed.  Only a handful of jokes got a laugh of me.  The rest ranged from cute to painfully ""esoteric"" (as he would put it.)

If you're a liberal, and you cannot laugh at the causes you hold most dear, don't watch Raw Feed.  You'll just be upset. For the rest of you, especially Miller fans, it's worth a rental but don't buy it.  You'll probably not watch it a second time.",1207612800,10,935,4.421052631578948

Here in Chicago, Dennis is brilliant, sharp, irreverent, and everything one wants a comedian to be, but--if ""NeoCon"" is your favorite curse--you will give The Raw Feed a low rating.

Furthermore, Black on White from the late eighties was one of the most inspiring, hilarious hours of comedy in history, but we should not compare late Dennis to early Dennis. It simply is not statistically possible for anyone to be that hysterical forever. He's very good now and he makes us laugh and smile. What more can we ask for?

1903472,1,B0000A7W10,"Dennis Miller started his career with such zeal and a great zest for standing up to anyone's authoritative morality that he was a great shining star in the Saturday Night Live cast.

He has placed spotlights on the wrong doings of so many people and institutions that his perceptions became a comedy language that many understood and wasn't ever duplicated.  He was a great comedian.

Then, something happened to him that is the death of any great comedian.  He stopped being impartial and became fanatical.

Great comedians have one trait that they all share:  They have faith in NOTHING.  When you chose a side, it means that you have placed people and ideas as ""off limits"".  All of a sudden, there are topics that you don't make fun of anymore.  This then presents a problem to your audience, because they start questioning your sincerity in your commentaries and in your humor.  In other words, why is this not funny anymore, but this is?

He went from being funny, to telling us what is funny.  This is not a true comedian. This is a ""preacher"", and since 9/11, we have witnessed what he considers is his ""religion"".

Many have said that he has always been this way, but for someone who has followed his career from the begining, my feeling is either:

1) This is True, and thus he has been lying to us all these years.

or

2) This is False, and has degenerated into a human fanatic.

In either case, I did not buy this video to be preached to, I bought it to laugh, and I sure as hell didn't laugh.  The aggrivation I had to go to return this product was traumatic enough that I will never buy another product of his ever again.",1150848000,15,1636,4.451178451178452

1903475,4,B0000A7W10,"Dennis Miller tilts to the right...so what? He's funny, he's smart, and he's unconventional. He is also unafraid to get into uncomfortable areas where most comedians fear to tread due to guaranteed politically-correct criticism. I find it interesting that the people who give this a one star review claim it's because Miller is a shill for the far right. Actually, he's not. He is essentially a libertarian (look at what he says about gay rights for a clear illustration of this) who believes in the defense of the United States, and doesn't mind stepping on toes in the process of defending his beliefs. I am sure the people who gave this one star think that Al Franken (Miller's personal friend, but politically his nemesis) is an utterly brilliant, totally unbiased comedian of great depth and insight. Please. I happen to think that Franken is also a very funny guy, and has as much right to espouse his own beliefs as Dennis Miller. The point is this: Dennis Miller has the right to his own viewpoints, too.

If you are totally close-minded to all but the far left wing, this DVD will undoubtedly offend you. If, on the other hand, you think it is refreshing to see a comedian take a logical (if politically incorrect) stand in the post-9/11 world (with bonus points for a pointedly hilarious anti-French monologue), this is the best DVD money can buy. I would give it five stars were it not for the sometimes excessive language that renders it unsuitable for all audiences.

Now, I don't want to get of on a rant here, but I used to think of Dennis Miller as a talented comedian. He would rail on pretension and idiocy wherever it was to be found.

In Feed, however, this once credible comic regresses dangerously close-to within spitting distance of Ann Coulter's hat size, by my estimation-to TV dinner and women driver jokes. Where he used to be intelligent and analytical, he's now shrill, tired, and-in the sense that he seems to be giving a 19-pound baby-like wide-birth to carefully chosen issues and Fox News sacred cows-the worst kind of cowardly, hypocritical, conservative shill.

In short, his shtick might best be summed up in the words of a real comedian:

He's stated that one of the reasons for his ""180 degree turnaround"" was that 9/11 changed him, and I'll buy that...if it was a deliberate career move and he means none of what he says now then he's easily one of the the most brilliant comics of all time.

Flash forward ten years.  Quayle's dumber doppleganger is now President and lies the country into an unwinnable war and Miller inexplicably can't suck up to him enough.

His realization that his former political views were vacuous, prefabricated, and, well, fabricated has transformed him into a humorous critic of the partisan shills he probably still counts among his friends.  Miller's intellect has begun to do him some good.

Miller was funny on SNL.  I still laugh at his jack-o-lantern / Dan Quayle joke.  But making jokes about Dan Quayle is like carrying coals to Newcastle.

As one may have noticed, the party above all, single party state advocates have heaped plenty of abuse on him.  I think his statement on the Tonight Show that he was proud to have George W. Bush as his president must have driven up the blood pressure and bile level in many of those blue jean millionaire elitist showbiz lockstep know nothings who, meanwhile, are trying to circumvent McCain-Feingold by establishing parallel organizations.

Campaign finance reform applies to others, not to them.  Just thought you'd like to know.

Anyway, this disk by Miller is okay.  It's a solid three stars.  It's not as funny as his Rants have been in the past, possibly because he's toning it down due to the reaction by his colleagues.  He wants to have a career in five or ten years, y'know.

I was for the most part completely disappointed. He reminded me of Michael Moore. As a liberal, I find Michael Moore a complete embarassment: vulgar, polemical, and utterly incapable of properly understanding the opposing team. This is Dennis Miller. In what must be an homage to the spaghetti western, he portrays conservatives as the champions of justice and the fonts of widsom (white hats), and liberals as drooling, weak-kneed morons (black hats). Not particularly funny, nor even all that original. It's not that I'm offended, it's just that if someone is so intelligent, he would realize that there is plenty to lampoon on both sides of the political aisle.
Yet even when he's not discussing politics, Miller just isn't particularly entertaining. His jokes are almost too byzantine. He does, on occasion, raise some interesting points, but his delivery is so long-winded that it kills the laugh. Exempli Gratia: Dennis Miller, who is so incogitably loquacious and prolix that his droleries become not risible but rather irksomely drudging, is unmitigatingly a pontificating and supercilious jerk. So Dennis went to college; that doesn't make him de facto funny.
Another weakness: much of his material is as hackneyed as the slips-on-banana or pie-in-the-face gags. Maybe I'm wrong, but jokes about the French and Catholics just aren't funny anymore--even with Miller's verbal window dressing.
To be fair, there are a few--a FEW--moments of genuine humor, and, in some inexplicable way I'm glad he's out there. I suppose that's because he's more intelligent than most.

He lost me -forever- at ""I like Dick Cheney."" and his ensuing comments about Cheney making money.
Of all the most despicable lumps of flesh in the world today, Cheney still ranks high on the top ten list. Anyone that promotes even a tiny bit of his malevolence deserves a one star rating (or maybe tarred and feathered then run out of town on a rail?) but since the rest of the skit, up to that point, was, more or less, brilliant I gotta give it another star. It could have gotten more except I fell asleep so part was not really that good.",1499040000,,566,4.2407407407407405
