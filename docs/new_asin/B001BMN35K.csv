3494625,5,B001BMN35K,"I have just finished watching this amazing film .
I was amazed that they didn't shy away from or tip toe around any of the issues,it was clear as day and directly to the point. Unlike many films with content of this nature,meaning sexual ambiguity,Inter Sexism,Transgender issues or anything that strays away from the male or female ""norm"". Norm or normal not being my words but society's.
XXY is heartbreaking and tense in some scenes,Loving and accepting in others. Most of the acceptance comes from her father who thinks she ""Alex"" is perfect just the way she is and she herself is accepting of who she is so she stops taking the female hormones that will alter her body to be more feminine because  she is confused and not sure what gender she really identifies with or maybe she just identifies with both. Something most people do on some levels. This film brought me to tears in several scenes because I understand the pain and weight of the ""what if someone finds out factor"". The surgeons son that is visiting Alex's family starts hanging out with Alex and she becomes quite sexually aggressive with him straight out of the gate.
He shy's away at first,not because of her XXY condition  because he is unaware of it even though his father is there to see if all involved will allow an operation to fix Alex's so called handicap.
When they do have sex I was shocked at what occurred and that they showed it. I wasn't shocked as in it doesn't happen but as in that they had the guts to actually show the act itself.
There is also a very disturbing scene where three boys ""older"" decide they want to see for themselves what she has as they say ""down there"".She was so tough and bold throughout the film that when this occurs you finally see how emotionally and physically vulnerable she really is. It's a film that would be entertaining to anyone not just someone close to this issue. I say bravo to the film makers and writers for being so brutally honest,after all this is how it really is.",1265932800,7,1996,4.526315789473684
3494626,5,B001BMN35K,"A letter to Luca Puenzo:

Dear Lucia, thank you for your amazing film XXY. I just finished watching it on DVD and I am truly moved not only by your artistry and confidence in filmmaking but also by the subject you so sensitively depict.  You created an immense emotional human drama from a taboo subject.

Fortunately social norms are in constant change, but we are still living with so many stigmatized topics from the past, and films like yours bring a great contribution to slowly but surely erase society's negative behavior about unusual or dissimilar people.  We are all human beings made of the same stuff.

Your film is HONEST.  You succeeded to create a non-exploitive wonderful film encouraging us to be sensitive to each other, understand and enjoy the diversity this noble nature is offering.  The major characters in your film are interesting, different and talented, young Alex and Alvaro are convincing and touching.

I will cherish this film for a long, long time to come.  I will recommend to all my friends and eagerly waiting for your next creation.  You are a talented artist.

Respectfully,
Adam",1254441600,22,1116,4.882978723404255
3494627,5,B001BMN35K,"I'm still reeling from watching this film last night. I'd watched it because someone had mentioned seeing it (a friend on Facebook) and she'd described it as ""disturbing.""  Living in PA, a relatively conservative area, I'm assuming now it was not a positive ""disturbing"" that she inferred.

My take away on this film was it's beautiful simplicity.  I ache for the decisions and categorization that those who are not ""gender specific"" must go through.  It can not be easy.  But who are we to make these breathing, living, emotional people feel that they must categorize themselves? The girl, Alex whom this story is about summed it up perfectly ""maybe there is no choice.""  I'd like to know more about the background of this film, the actors, etc.  But taking it as a movie, I know there are many who have had to deal with this situation and it can't be easy.  Are we as society forcing them to deal with what they were born as/with?  Yes, to some extent we are.  But we must also realize that with both male and female traits and body aspects, comes hormonal signals that must be very difficult to deal with.  Knowing that you look like a girl on the outside, but act with agression at times due to the male aspects of yourself, yet being attracted to one particular sex or both, can not make it any easier.

It is a two fold (society and self) anxiety that these folks must deal with (just as transgendered/transexual folks deal with).  Some don't have both sets of genitalia but their minds or bodies often do not agree with the physical representation that they present, male or female.  We as a society have a long way to go to accept people as they are.  Who are we to judge? We can not know what a person feels (unless it is ourself!).

I love this film, the contrast of the simplicity of dialogue, the slow pace of the film with the extreme pain this character was experiencing.  The beautiful thing in this film was the undying support that her parents provided.  They had the option to have the situation surgically ""taken care of"" at Alex's birth, however they opted not to, the father stating that when Alex was born ""she was perfect.""",1247097600,2,2146,4.52987012987013
3494628,5,B001BMN35K,"This is an Argentinean film about an Argentinean family coming to terms with their daugther's crossroad in choosing her sex gender.  By getting away from the controversy about homosexuality and whether it is acceptable or not, this film centers on the emotionally charged situation when gender is not clearly defined.  Although the family had chosen reclusion (""staying in the closet"") as the movie unfolds so they are forced to ""come out of the closet"" and face their own reality.  The born-girl is not alone as she has her parents' love for who she is, but they also have to deal with their own adjustment.  This is surely a very emotionally involving movie which will bring a very animated discussion after watching it.  Do not expect any Hollywood-style superficiality and/or commercially profitable catchy scenes as the subject is deal with very tenderly.  A must see.",1246233600,5,873,5.027777777777778
3494629,5,B001BMN35K,"Born into a modern Argentine family of three daughters, hermaphrodite has during fifteen years to date been grown as a girl. The recent experimenting with a family friends' bit older teen son has brought about a different experience and feelings, confusing and dividing even own parents with a choice their offspring facing and responsible for solely.

A nice intelligent movie on a rarely screened topic is, perhaps, of a much better purely technical quality than DVD a reviewer owns presents.",1241654400,,494,5.175
3494630,4,B001BMN35K,"This is truly a fantastic film, marred only very slightly by one strange and slightly mystifying scene that feels almost condescending (more on this in a moment).

Alex's parents have not, in fact, decided to have her ""normalized.""  Her father, Kraken, convinced her mother, Suli, not to let the doctors operate on her when she was born because she was, in his words ""perfect.""  Instead, he wants to protect her until she's old enough to make up her own mind.  Suli, is less certain about what would be best, and invites Ramiro (the surgeon) and Erika (his wife) to visit from Buenos Aires.  With them arrives their adolescent son, Alvaro, who becomes fascinated with Alex.  Ramiro is a distant and uncaring father, but his relationship with Alvaro is explained almost entirely in a single scene where he reveals his disappointment with Alvaro.  The contrast between Kraken, who can love Alex despite pressure from the larger world to make her ""normal,"" and Ramiro, who is afraid his son may be gay, is so sharply drawn that it feels manipulative and obvious.  This is unfortunate, because the rest of the movie is so steeped in ambiguity that the cliches here really stand out.

That said, this is a very worthwhile film, and Ricardo Darin (Kraken) especially completely inhabits his role, exuding both love and uncertainty in equal measure.",1237939200,4,1342,4.902654867256637
3494631,5,B001BMN35K,"The chromosomal abnormality of XXY has been labeled as Klinefelter's Syndrome, hermaphroditism, and Intersex.  The 'conception' defect results in a child with both male and female organs and when detected at birth usually results in a decision between physicians and parents to surgically alter the child to be one or the other phenotypic assignments - male or female.  In this remarkably sensitive film based on a short story 'Cinismo' by Sergio Bizzio and adapted for the screen by writer/director Luca Puenzo, XXY becomes a story of understanding and acceptance of a diagnosis by both child and parents and the conflicts such gender variation can present.

Alex (Ins Efron) is the XXY patient of the story, having been raised on the isolated coastline of Uruguay as a girl with the aid of supplemental hormones until age 15, the age when her loving Argentinean parents Kraken (Ricardo Darn) and Suli (Valeria Bertuccelli) have decided she should have her 'offending member' removed, allowing her to become a completely phenotypic female.  Alex is deeply conflicted about her situation, refuses to take her medications and enjoys being 'one of the boys' in secret.  When Alex's parents invite their surgeon friend Ramiro (Germn Palacios) and his wife Erika (Carolina Pelleritti) to their home to advise them on the surgical alternatives, they are accompanied by their artistic son Alvaro (Martn Piroyansky). There is an attraction between Alex and Alvaro and this ultimately results in a crisis that results in the coming of age and self-acceptance of both youngsters. Luca Puenzo and her fine cast sensitively explore the interaction between parents and children and the coming to grips with choice of identity.  This is yet another challenging and rewarding film from Argentina, one that stands alone as a fine movie, but one that also would be wise to add to the film libraries  of high school and college students and of patient resource facilities who deal with problems of gender identity.  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, October 08",1225065600,81,2042,5.182370820668693
3494632,5,B001BMN35K,"15 year old Alex (Ins Efron) was born intersex; she resembles a female (and takes hormones to enhance this), but has male genitals. As she has grown older, her parents moved her from her home in Buenos Aires, Argentina, to an isolated fishing village on the coast of Uruguay, to avoid the questions of friends and relatives. Her mother is desperate for her to become wholly female, and invites a plastic surgeon (along with his wife and son) to their village to discuss surgical options. The son, Alvaro (Martin Piroyansky), is questioning his own sexuality...which becomes all the more confused as he and Alex grow attracted to one another.

XXY (Spanish, English subtitles) deals with age-old themes (social stigma, parental conflict, societal demands for sexual conformity) in a refreshing context. What does it mean to be 'male' or 'female'? Is the pressure to choose one gender or another innate, or socially-enforced? Are the neuroses that young people suffer wholly attributable to parental desire for social orthodoxy? A post-op female-to-male acquaintance of Alex's father advises: ""Making her afraid of her body is the worst thing you can do to a child""...(oddly reminiscent of Van Dijk's classic quote: ""Sexuality is something granted to everyone, and to teach a child to abstain from this evident intimacy is perhaps the first form of sexual violence to which it is subjected""). XXY does not seek to resolve these (perhaps unresolvable) questions, but does an excellent job of casting light onto such neglected areas of social life.

The acting is remarkable for what must have been challenging roles; completely natural and unselfconscious. The lead characters do a superb job of conveying (frequently through body language and eye movement) the turmoil that they undergo, but credit also to an exceptional supporting cast, including the powerful performance of Ricardo Darn in the role of Alex's father. The camera work and lighting combine with these other aspects to result in a moody, poignant and most memorable film. Highly recommended.",1223424000,46,2055,5.224242424242425
3494633,5,B001BMN35K,"Being adolescent is hard enough.  This film touches up on much more complex issues.  What can parents do to help their child choose his/her sex when that child has both?  When a person is born with both sexual organs, most parents decide the sex of the child shortly after birth.  But Alex's parents felt that is should be their child who should decide their sex.  Alex is raised as a girl.  But puberty is bringing some hard decision for Alex, her friends and family.  Shall Alex remain a girl and have an operation to remove her other organ?  This would be easier to answer is Alex knew her sexual preference.  She feels she is a boy but there is a fragility in her that is very obvious.  There is a moment in a film that I found heartbreaking.  Alex sits with her closest friends: high school girlfriend who is sexually active,intrigued and not frightened about Alex's body; Alex's best friend from the local schoool who was stunned to discover that Alex is not just an ordinary girl.  Alex's accidental lover, a slightly older boy who discovers after being with Alex that he is really gay - to the shock of his own parents.  The bravest decision Alex can make is to acknowledge publicly  what she is, not have any surgeries and let time show on who her live partner will be as the time goes by when she can sort out her own emotions.  This film is like no other film I have seen so far.  It will get you thinking about how complex human sexuality and our emotions really are.",1222387200,30,1479,4.402214022140221

Now at birth of this child they were given the chance to allow surgery to correct this situation but then that brought about many problems and so they allow their child to grow up as a girl. Nearing the age of 15 she, however, began to realize that her male part is influencing her more, causing her to stop taking the medication to keep her femininity. But now she has a boyfriend and a male cousin; both showing great affection toward her, thus creating some more problems for her concerning her future and most importantly their acceptance of her (or him) regardless of the decision she (or he ) makes.",1488412800,2,734,4.526315789473684

1. The title of the film refers a genetic condition called Klinefelter syndrome, in which a person has an extra sex chromosome, which makes them genetically male and female. However, the title is a little misleading.

2. It's about a teenage girl named Alex, who is intersex (which is actually not the same thing as having Klinefelter syndrome), living with her family in Uruguay. The family invites a surgeon and his family to stay with them because Alex's parents want her to consider having surgery.

3. Alex's situation is escalated when she makes a sexual advance on lvaro, the son of the surgeon. This incident sets off a subplot about lvaro, who is discovering his own sexual awakening.

4. The movie is written and directed by Luca Puenzo, an Argentinian film-maker who focuses a lot of her work on issues of body modification.

5. I don't think I've ever seen such a sensitive portrayal of the intersex community (no, The Crying Game doesn't count).

6. Alex is played by Ins Efron. The way she portrays a person caught between genders is mesmerizing. You can really feel her rage and confusion and shame, knowing she doesn't fit into society in even the most basic of ways.

7. There is a scene of sexual assault that, while not physically damaging, is emotionally excruciating.

8. The evolving relationships between Alex and her family show a few of the difficulties that the families of an intersex person must face. Many issues are brought up in both families, and just like real life, they aren't really resolved.

9. Topics such as gender fluidity and sexual fluidity are being more openly discussed in today's society. But this quiet little Argentinian film from 2007 is the best illustration of the subject that I've seen.",1455062400,,1774,4.8283828382838285

SPOILER:  We have a teenager born with a genetic defect, both X and Y chromosomes resulting in development of both male and female sexual organs and a mixture of secondary sexual characters.  After dragging through the entire film experiencing the horrors of social problems created by the genetic anomaly, she decides at the end that it's just fine to be a hermaphrodite and stops taking the hormones that would have made her fully female.  Nothing in the film gives credence to her decision; it's just the ha-ha-fooled-you shocking ending.  Inept storytelling at its worst.",1448064000,,718,5.0508474576271185

This of course in addition to her sexual exploration made for a little bit of a discomfort for the viewing eye. Not in a sense of visual grossness or being unnatural, but more in a sense of ""wow. I don't think homeboy was prepared for that and neither was I.""  I thought this movie was a great eye opener, and about as realistic as it can get for any relatable situation.

3495077,3,B001BMN35K,"A brave film treated with a small dose of medical  information or folkloric mentioning. There's very little the world knows about hermaphrodites, although they do exist and appear occasionally as folkloric beings in history rather than legitimate human beings.

I haven't heard about androgynous individuals since Boccacio's Decameron three decades ago; these individuals possess both genitals, a penis and a vagina; folklore has them as being of feminine, beautiful appearance, shy and introverted; one may say antisocial. Nothing like that is  portrayed in XXY.

The film has homosexual undertones which, in my opinion, tend to divert the attention of the public to something that might not be. An example is the translation, the original dialogue is written in proper Spanish, while the translation is rather vulgar and trashy. Then the hermaphrodite's character behavior is out of context, it rapes a boy with anal sex, and they both expressed they liked it. The classic submissiveness, timidity and sheepishness of the hermaphrodite is totally shattered in this film.

Ricardo Darin who plays the androgynous' father is one of the most recognized actors in Argentina, one of his better films is The Nine Queens, a good suspense film. It appears that after it, he came out of the closet and became an activist for the lgbt movement down there. Which is fine, people can do what ever they want with their lives.

As afore stated, there seems to exist very little public or medical information about this condition of gender and sexuality, since I watched the film, I've been gleaning and skimming the surface and could not find any more that I had already known; perhaps if I make a more profund search I might find better explanations and consensus on the matter. But I don't have the time or desire to become an erudite on hermaphrodites.
I do, however, recommend the film, I watched with more than a grain of salt, but it treats an area many don't dare to film.",1433289600,2,1967,4.963525835866261

*** In Spanish with English subtitles ***

Alex (Ins Efron) is born intersex and her compassionate father insists no surgical action be taken to specify his child's sex. They leave Buenos Aires and raise Alex as a female in an isolated coastal village of Uruguay where they will be unknown.  Using supplemental hormones to avoid the appearance of masculinity, Alex keeps the nature of her gender a secret.  Yet at 15, Alex chooses to abandon her medication.  In doing so her aggressiveness and sex drive appear to increase.  Her secret is out and one conflict after another begins to emerge.  To complicate things further, her mother is now pushing for a surgical choice to finalize Alex's sex. It's a time for Alex to come to terms with her identity and explore who she wants to be and how she is willing to be perceived.

This was a very interesting story.  I thought it opened kinda slow and wondered just where it would go.  Alex seemed to be very immature and I wasn't liking her character too much at first.  Initially, I didn't make the connection of how stopping her hormones might be affecting her behavior. But she's aggressive enough to get in a fight and make a sexual proposition. There is one sex scene here and I'm absolutely shocked (in a good way) at how it played out, lol.

Once the town knows what's going on, there is some expected negativity.  But I was glad the film didn't turn into a complete downer. The drama between Alex's potential surgeon and his son was weakly played out and implausibly cruel. I didn't care for that at all.  But the fact that Alex's father is so supportive in her decision to choose a gender, or even none at all, was a very uplifting aspect of the film.  Many intersex people never get to choose. Not that this made everything free and easy... but it sure didn't complicate her life more.  And I think this positive model is the very best aspect of the story.

If you don't know much about intersex people (not to be confused with transgender or transsexual)... google a fact sheet.  Many doctors will choose a sex assignment for the intersex child at birth.  Surgery and hormone treatments have been used for decades to make intersex babies resemble the gender the doc determined (even though the intersex person may identify otherwise at any point, like puberty or later).  And it became one of those things people just didn't talk about.  Things are changing.  And the research available along with the effects of these surgeries are definitely worth reading about.",1407283200,2,2530,4.676470588235294
3495112,5,B001BMN35K,"The excellent cast of XXY help focus a cinematic eye on an intersexed teen. The film's perspective is delicate, but doesn't skirt truth. Often, a film on this subject humors the hungry curiosity of those who just want to ""see."" But for the intersexed person, condition and psyche twist in a way no dialogue can explain. The actors therefore use several moments of silence to sculpt a true picture of a difficult life. This film turns ""normal"" into a questionable reality and ""freak"" into a non-existent state. With its display of true frustration, love, hate and confusion, this is really a beautiful film.",1401840000,,606,4.893203883495145

3495114,3,B001BMN35K,"The opening credit sequence for Lucia Puenzo's 2007 xxy consists of either deep sea or intrauterine life forms, floating and pulsing in a formless void. The movie is about Alex, an ""intersexed"" or hermaphoditic child of fourteen who does his/her own version of pulsing and floating in a formless void. It was filmed on what appears to be an isolated island off the coast of Argentina where Alex's parents have retreated in order to provide a safe environment for their sport of nature. Alex's mother leans towards a surgical intervention to make her definitively female; her father does not want to force the issue, preferring to let Alex decide. Alex alternates between boyishness, intense curiosity about boys, and a little girl's vulnerability. None of the characters, including a visiting plastic surgeon eager to reassign Alex's sex and an assortment of adolescent boys simultaneously fascinated and repelled by Alex's condition appear able to communicate with one another. This strikes me less as a reflection on Argentinean machismo as that they are all in the kind of international art house drama in which extreme personal alienation amounting to social mutism is de rigeur.

3495118,5,B001BMN35K,"XXY is a sensitive and poignant portrayal of the issues facing intersex people. The issues raised for both the intersexed person and their families, the callousness of the medical scientists (to whom the intersexed person is an object for study rather than a person) and how town communities react were unflinchingly examined. Humanity is supposedly civilised, but still as cruel as ever to anything considered different from the norm (the parallel cruelty to the endangered turtles was also significant.)

Both acting and directing in this movie is superb.

Ins Efron as Alex, and Ricardo Darn as her compassionate father Kraken, were both outstanding. With her father's love, support and understanding behind her, Alex's search for her own definition of individuality and sexuality, although it will be lifelong and excruciatingly hard, may be easier than young Alvaro's search, for his homophobic and arrogant father (the surgeon brought in by Alex's mother to ""assess"" her) spends his time making people ""normal"" by surgically removing ""deformities."" Kraken, on the other hand, as a marine biologist working to save turtles whose sex cannot be determined from the outside sees Alex as ""perfect.""

Luca Puenzo's direction is subtle, exquisite and deeply thought provoking. XXY is a thoroughly engaging movie and deserves all the awards it won.",1328400000,5,1346,5.369668246445498

Ines Efron is captivating in her role as an intersex teenager, who has to face some rather horrid and emotional events in her growing-up experience.

Argentine superstar Ricardo Darn (The Secret in Their Eyes) is also amazing as Alex's caring father.

Excellent and lyrical movie.",1292544000,,446,4.620253164556962

Some of the central characters and their motivation are not very well developed but the main characters are very authentic and the story is engaging. The actors did a great job and were very believable. The themes dealt with in this film are what many people live through everyday. The details may be different but struggles with identity, pressure to conform to some a culturally acceptable norm and bullying are themes that nearly everyone if they are being honest can relate to. If you are unable to accept that people may not fit your ideas about gender norms and sexual orientation watch something else.",1524787200,,746,5.024193548387097

We must stop mutilating people to ""normalize"" them into one of two checkboxes to fit our established social structure, when clearly our culture is the problem, not the other way around.",1514678400,2,457,4.871794871794871

8283579,4,B001BMN35K,"Its an odd and querky little film. I wanted to give this one a 3 star just because I felt the story plot was unfair by creating Alex as such a mean snot at first. That part bothered me, because too often stories make the 'not so normal' people out as monsters just because they are different. but the story goes into a brave opening that others dont. So it won a star back. I loved how the father instantly accepted his child's decision to discontue the 'normalcy' conditioning of pills. And here was this visiting surgeon, and his family, that was supposed to be a better man hating on his son over an assumption that he might be gay,  I felt bad for that kid because he was only coming to realize that he was at least Bi and found a freeing comfort, only to get leveled over by his father's oldfashion, macho bulls**t.

What cost this film a star was all the awkwardness of the adults. Its almost like the directors didn't give anyone but Alex and his/her father any lines. Everyone else had to adlib. Making everyone coms across as estranged. Very odd. There were others things that were thrown in there that could have developed further to give this film some real depth, but instead seemed to just be used as meaningless filler. Shame.

Lastly, to leave on a good note: the cinematography gets a A+",1496275200,,1303,4.420833333333333

8283581,2,B001BMN35K,I almost gave up on this movie when nothing happens for the first 15-20 minutes. There's a plot twist that kicks off the real story and from then on it picks up a bit. The B plots are really just tacked on and don't add much to the story. There's a kinda forced parallel with the turtles but the movie would have worked without it.,1490486400,,331,4.107692307692307
8283582,5,B001BMN35K,"This is clearly not the type of film Americans are accustomed to.  Yes, it is a ""dark"" film, also filmed from a very intense human interest viewpoint.  It is a quiet film. The main characters are in the final stage of struggling with their feelings of rejection or acceptance of their situation, the 15 year old hermaphrodite XXY teenage ""girl"", a sexually confused teenage boy, rejected by his machismo Argentinean surgeon father, and the parents of the girl who are struggling with the moral burdens of deciding whether to let their daughter decide on her ultimate sexuality or to yield to society's pressure to have her castrated and have her male parts amputated. The actors and actresses are well chosen and as they are not ""beautiful people"", do not distract from the central emotional and moral issues involved.  If you are interested in find a titillating or sex oriented movie, stay away from this; you won't either understand it or like it.  If you are interested in viewing a depiction of personal struggle and eventual resolution, this should be for you.",1489017600,23,1066,4.87292817679558
