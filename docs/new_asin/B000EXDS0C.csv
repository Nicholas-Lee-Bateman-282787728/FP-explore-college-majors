2544464,5,B000EXDS0C,"After a quite lengthy wait between releasing Seasons 2 and 3, Fox is quickly releasing Season 4 to the joy of NYPD Blue fans everywhere. In Season 4 some things change: Det. Adrianne Lesniak (Justine Miceli) leaves, replaced by Det. Jill Kirkendall (Andrea Thompson), and Det. James Martinez (Nicholas Turturro) finds his future wife in PAA Gina Colon (Lourdes Benedicto), while some things remain the same: Detectives Bobby Simone (Jimmy Smits) and Diane Russell (Kim Delaney) are still experiencing growing pains in their relationship as Diane accepts an undercover assignment and has the added pressures of her family.  However, the main theme of the show - the redemption of Andy Sipowicz (Dennis Franz) - is still ongoing after losing his son and falling off the wagon. The personal relationships between the characters to one side, the series continues to impress as a realistic, first-rate crime drama, thanks to the writing of David Milch and the technical expertise of Bill Clarke, plus the natural chemistry between Franz and Smits as co-workers. Those who come to the series for the first time will be as hooked as anyone who followed it during its 12-year run. We fans can only hope this set does well enough to spawn a Season 5.

2544491,5,B000EXDS0C,"Season 4 begins with the continuation of Simone & Russell's relationship and how Bobby has to come to grips with her unexpected reaction to his proposal at first. The storylines throughout the season dealt with Andy's psychological scars beginning to heal after the death of his son Andy Jr.  Towards the  end of Season 4, there is tension between Bobby and Andy over Simone's working with the FBI and the stonewalling he must do to keep secret a favor he was asked to do by an old acquaintance (Joey Salvo).  The final two episodes are taut with tension as IAB presses Bobby for details on what he knows about Salvo.  Scott Allan Campbell's work as Sgt Martens (IAB) is particulary noteworthy and is commendable, esp as he works the squad for info involving Bobby & Salvo.

Kim Delaney earns a well deserved Emmy for her work as Det. Diane Russell, whose character gets involved in an undercover operation with Jimmy Liery & tries to maintain sanity and sobriety as she deals with demons in her past that involve her abusive father.  She had such on screen chemistry witn Jimmy Smits, even as the Bobby/Diane relationship goes through its ups and downs...

Special recognition for Andrea Thomspon's work as Det. Jill Kirkendall who arrives in the 6th episode; she shows a calm but take-no-crap approach in the cases she works with the 15th Squad.

The season finale is a cliff hanger & leaves fans wondering about Simone's future after one final meeting with Salvo that reaches an ultimate conclusion.",1468627200,,1502,4.794573643410852

2544910,5,B000EXDS0C,"NYPD Blue is one of the great TV dramas ever produced.  The cast was magnificent and even when cast members changed, the shows did not miss a beat. Without a doubt, the one cast member who kept the drama together was Dennis Franz.  Andy Cipiwitz was the one constant and his love/hate relationship with Lt. Fancy (James McDaniels) was a real life example of race relations in a turbulent time in  a Northern big city.  I don't think American television will ever see a longer running drama and its average number of episodes of 20 to 26 per year. is unheard of in today's short TV seasons.",1445472000,,589,4.4766355140186915

2544935,1,B000EXDS0C,Sipowitz is a rude and ignorant idiot. Russell needs to be replaced. Too many unnecessary face sucking scenes.

2544954,5,B000EXDS0C,"Season 4 of NYPD Blue is where the show was really firing on all cylinders. Jimmy Smits as Bobby Simone has true and visceral chemistry with partner Det. Andy Sipowicz played by 2X Emmy Award winner Dennis Franz who is still grieving the murder of his older son, while also providing for his wife D.A. Sylvia Costas (Sharon Lawrence) & baby boy Theo. Simone's budding relationship with Det. Diane Russell (Kim Delaney) is put on hold while Diane has to face up to personal demons before making any kind of commitment.
A mid-season treat is in store for any fans of NBC drama ""Law & Order: SVU"" who will see Christopher Meloni in a sharply contrasting role of a street hood Jimmy Liery, who is the polar opposite of his well-known role of Elliott Stabler. While season 4 contains no major bombshell that changes the beloved 15th squad, the brilliant acting, writing, and directing gells this cast as the most iconic of the 12 seasons NYPD Blue. The sad fact is, they just don't make them like this anymore.",1441497600,5,1005,4.620111731843576

2545353,5,B000EXDS0C,"This show is simply awesome!  We were living in Australia when this show was on, so we missed out...but thanks to Amazon Prime we are enjoying this great show!  There are SO many 'cop' shows out there, but I don't think any have caught what is really going on in the police department as this one.  I think the only show that had the same kind of 'grit' as this one was 'The Shield', but I was never a huge fan of that one although it was very good.  Check it out if you have not seen it already.  Jimmy Smits really hit a career high with this one, and Dennis Franz is simply worth the price of admission - we look forward to a 'Sipowitz moment' on every show!! The Sipowitz character reminds me of the 'politically incorrect' days of All in the Family with Archie Bunker, and I really think we need MORE of that in our shows today!",1413676800,,833,4.149068322981367

What makes this show such a standout for me is the way the creators and writers blend the Police Procedural aspects with the personal stories of the cast. Andy continued to grow as a person after a slip following the murder of Andy Jr. who was in training as a cop. Bobby has begun to utter some funny one liners from time to time. If you are upset by the gratuitous violence portrayed on moe recent crime shows, then take a stroll down memory lane and enjoy some NYPD Blue, There are 12 seasons on Amazon Prime and I still have 8.5 left (almost 200 more episodes).",1412985600,,687,4.172932330827067

2545425,3,B000EXDS0C,"A lot of drama and interesting shows however, the sexual scenes are not necessary and merely an expression of a director that want's to cross over the line. Dennis Franz is consistent and shows his acting skills with a lot of good people in other supporting roles. Franz should have been the headliner, not Jimmy Smitts, who later ended up playing a skid row part in ""Sons of Anarchy"". James and Greg play their roles very well and are fun to watch their characters dwell on unimportant subjects and roles during the program.",1400544000,,525,4.655913978494624
2545426,5,B000EXDS0C,Nice to watch a program that still shows the Twin Towers.  When things were bad in the Big Apple at that time it seems so much milder than after 9/11.  Just an eye opener today.  Still nice to have some believable heros with a few flaws but with good intentions.  Life has changed.  Seems nicer than watching new cop shows today.,1400544000,,329,4.327868852459017

The police detectives are very professional and as tough as nails.  The series also follows how these detectives  react to different social issues, and the personal issues that can develop in the course of their everyday lives.",1400284800,,377,4.9523809523809526
2545429,3,B000EXDS0C,"I have been a fan of the series for many years but the fourth season is not as good as the prior three seasons.  Although Dennis Franz carries the day he can not do it all alone.  The writers are weak and repeditive and the story line is boring and slags in places.  Sometimes I just want them to get it over with.

The original premise of the series was about the police officers and their lives, private and otherwise.  The soft porn was what sold and what made an ordinary police show something worth watching.  The critics got involved and now it's just another show.",1400025600,,571,4.339622641509434

2545450,5,B000EXDS0C,This is the police show that started all the police shows! It is incredibly real to life and the character development is wonderful. There are so many actors in the series that I had forgotten - people who have gone on to a lot of fame. This is a great series with a lot of surprises. You can never take things for granted...even with the main characters.,1396396800,,355,4.313432835820896

2545458,5,B000EXDS0C,"This is a great series, possibly the best series ever created. The depth and gritty reality of each of the characters speaks well of the writing behind the series; it tackles controversial subjects head on, teaches good moral lessons, yet still has plenty of humor. I've watched each of the--I think--261 episodes at least a couple times each. The other thing that's nice about this series is that it doesn't get old; there are so many episodes, and several sub-plots going on in each one, that you don't get bored re-watching them, to pick up nuances you missed first time around.",1395014400,,581,4.762376237623762
2545459,4,B000EXDS0C,"Well, I can't give the accolades to this season that I gave to the last couple. I found this season to be interesting, but devoid of any deep story arc. It was like a bunch of Murder She Wrote episodes. Well, not as bad because the writers had the class to not have the bad guy ""spill the beans"" at the end and ""explain him/her self"". That was one of the formula's that made me not like cop shows in the first place. You know the formula - each episode is about one or two cases that get solved in an hour with no real story arc taking you through the season as if the whole season was one big story. The art of the Story Arc has improved over the years and I believe is a big part of why shows like Breaking Bad, The Sopranos, and The Walking Dead are so intensely popular. Each week, you don't end the show thinking that you might miss next week but you won't miss anything important to a long range plot. With shows that have their traction in a long story arc that traverses an entire season - or in the case of Breaking Bad - the entire show - fans cannot miss the next episode no matter what. I didn't find that to be the case with NYPDB Season 4. I could have watched the entire season in random order and not missed a thing, except for the two episodes at the end that were about Simone's brush with IAB.

But that being said, for the type of show it is, it still is very strong. Sipowicz is the best thing on the show and I hope he never leaves because if he does I won't watch it anymore. I doubt I would have watched it had this actor not been at the helm of the delivery of this complex, intense, scary yet lovable character.

All in all, a great show still, even though the writers aren't long range thinkers.

2545521,4,B000EXDS0C,"First there was Hill Street Blues, then NYPD, then Southland; great ""sign of the times"" cop shows, ea. a little more authentic than the last.  My only criticism is Kim Delaney/Diane, Bobby's ""love interest"".  Aside from not caring for DL's acting skill, the character seems to be a mismatch, and all she does is pull down the people around her.  Amy Brennigan basically tanked John Kelly's (David Caruso) career from him trying to help her; now Bobby Simone spends half his time trying to deal w/ a loose screw.  Doesn't add to the show/story, IMO; detracts from the drama.  Aside from that, NYPD is one of the best shows out there.",1375056000,,632,4.657657657657658

2545551,5,B000EXDS0C,"With all the characters ready to jump, indeed they did jump.  James McDaniel as Lt. Fancy gives a stellar performance as he supports the squad individually as well as collectively.  Jimmy  Smits as Bobby Simone was at his finest hours.  He was in love with Diane, he understood Andy and buoyed Andy up when Andy's personality became obstructive.  Dennis Franz as Andy Sipowicz continued to develop and grow in his character.  The thing about Franz is that I sensed from day one at NYPD BLUE, he knew who Sipowicz was and where he was going from Season 1 through Season 4 and throughout Season 12.  He was just so consistently Andy.  Kim Delaney as Diane Russell was an outstanding female character for NYPD BLUE.  She was an astonishingly subtle and instinctively strong character.  BLUE always placed her, Kirkendall, Medavoy and Martinez in the secondary ""case"" of the week.  Delaney never smarted from the mid-1990s female minor subjective rolls.  She stayed true to her character and in spite of its minimal role (next to Dennis and Jimmy) she stood tall and became her own ""strength of character.""  This season introduced a racial component that to me seemed forced from both Sipowicz and Fancy.  Beyond that discomfort, the season flowed flawlessly and today is one of my greatest seasons of NYPD BLUE as well as all of tv series.",1365033600,,1336,4.828193832599119

The few police drama shows that remain are poorly written and use blood and guts plus loud background music in an attempt to keep viewers awake.  NYPD Blue was produced back when the entertainment industry employed actual writers to develop the stories.  Thanks to Amazon and NetFlicks, I can still find programs produced during the period when Hollywood was willing to pay for quality.  The character Detective Andy Sipowicz played by Dennis Franz is a real gem and the entire cast do a great job.

Since revisiting it thru Amazon Prime I have been convinced that the acting, storylines, and character development have never been matched.  Andy Sipowicz has to be the funniest, most compassionate (in his own way), and long-suffering character ever. Very few of the main players in this show have ever been less than stellar and many have been brilliant.  Bobby Simone, Dianne Russell, Fancy, Medavoy, Sylvia, gay John, all wonderful portrayals and there are many more that I won't mention here.  It was obvious that all involved in this compelling show took great pride in their craft and it holds up well to repeated viewings. My wife and I watch a couple of episodes regularly and always are moved by the great acting and the stories.  Great television, makes most of what passed for drama these days look fairly pathetic.

I have a friend who is a police officer - he and all of his fellow officers are still huge fans and would really love to see the whole series released on DVD.  Some of them have homemade VHS tapes, but they only last so long before they wear out.

One reviewer stated that Fox would not release any more seasons because of poor sales of the first four.  We believe the reason for the poor sales was because they were released a while ago and the price was $50 - $60 per season.  Most people just cannot afford that!  However, years have passed since the series ended, so they wouldn't be able to charge that much now and therefore the price could be more affordable, so sales would definitely pick up.  I think Fox Studios would be pleasantly surprised at how large a market there still is out there for this series.  So how about it Fox, are ya listening????",1284854400,9,938,4.201117318435754

In season 4, Sipowicz's son Theo is born, and we see Andy mellow just a bit. Medavoy forges a friendship with a gay (female) cop who asks him to become a surrogate father.  There's a lot happening in the personal lives of the whole squad.

I would rather buy the dvds but I think I will just take the remaining seasons off the air as Fox does not intend to release them.  I hate it when series are released and then just stopped because 'sales do not justify further seasons'.  Does Fox not bother doing market research to see what the demand is prior to releasing?  I have never season any advertising for the sets so maybe there is your answer.

I would rather not have a series than to have a situation like in Season 4 of NYPD Blue where there is a cliffhanger in the final episode and I will never know what happens next.

Fox has done the same with 'Hill Street Blues', 'St. Elsewhere', 'Picket Fences', 'The Practice', etc. so the excuse is wearing thin as you figure they would learn from one experience.

2545605,1,B000EXDS0C,"The series is fantastic - I have no quarrel with that - unfortunately each and every NYPD BLUE series season discs that I have bought to date are of a very cheap quality and additionally, take a lot of the pleasure out of the viewing. After the obligatory FBI warnings and 20th century logos the disc goes straight to ""episodes"" with no ""play all"" option or ""set up"" option. Clicking on an episode then takes you to a perfectly useless submenu where you can either choose ""play"", ""set-up"" (for language and subtitles), ""scenes"" or ""disc main menu"" which takes you back to the irritating episode guide.

I generally like to watch TV Series when I am feeling unwell - I tend to doze when I am ill and having a favorite TV show playing in the background is usually soothing - not so with NYPD Blue as there is no option for a smooth transition from episode to episode, which is particularly annoying when the previous episode ends with a cliffhanger!

I know that discs can get scratched during shipping but this is especially liable to happen and ruin a disc when there are dual sided discs involved - they become dislodged during shipping and the B-side gets scratched by the very thing meant to hold them in place!
I am truly disappointed that Amazon does not give any ""menu"" info - after having purchased four seasons of NYPD Blue I would never willingly buy another DVD like this, regardless of how great the series is.

2545607,2,B000EXDS0C,"I'll skip the glowing praise for the show in this short review, and instead address something I feel has been largely ignored: the packaging.

Seasons 1 and 2 came in a nice fold-out boxed set and ran at 6 DVDs. They played great on all my DVD players and were as beautiful as the content on them. Unfortunately, someone decided to save money by using 2-sided DVDs and reduce the count to 4 (and smaller packaging as well) with Seasons 3 and 4. For those of you not familiar with dual-sided discs I say this . . . Ordinarily, if they are used it's to have a 1-side is fullscreen (pan and scan) 1-side is widescreen movie disc. This is in itself no great hardship, since the main issues with such discs (there's nowhere to safely touch but the inner ring and outer edge, which is damn difficult putting it in or taking it our of a case) is mitigated by the owner's preference of 4:3 or 16:9; That is, you'll always play one or the other so the inevitable fingerprints are not that big a deal, since you'll touch the 'top' you never play.

Unfortunately, the episodes in NYPD Blue are on both sides of all the discs, so the inevitable fingerprints (and I imagine scratches, sooner or later) prevent you playing episodes. Not to mention that out of the box I had issues playing them on one of my DVD players. I don't know if it's bending the spec on compression, oversized discs, or some exotic new copy-protection mod, but I will say this: I resent buying discs that appear designed to fail and cost me to replace later on. I, for one, would gladly pay extra for the single-sided DVDs and larger packaging they used previously. I'm Extremely unhappy with the new packaging\discs and would advise anyone looking to get the series to think twice if they have problems with newer or dual-sided DVDs.

Short form? Horrible changes I suspect were just to boost a profit margin at the fans' expense. Not only am I unlikely to pick up Season 5 or later if they stick with the format, I'm seriously considering unloading what I already bought.",1180828800,17,2033,4.489189189189189

2545622,4,B000EXDS0C,"This set should've rated five stars easily with my criteria. The show was at its peak, with great story lines, great characters and fantastic writing. The extras on the set were solid, with three commentaries, including one from two actresses from the show and two from producers. There was a featurette looking at the new characters and another focusing on the ""Look"" of NYPD Blue, which in and of itself was basically a character on the show.

What made this set so tough was the continued use of double-sided dual discs. I know that this saves money and without these types of disc, which were also used for season three, we may not have seen NYPD Blue after the first two seasons, but I just have to complain. I had one disc that the main menu wouldn't pop up, which left me scratching my head on how to get past the first episode (which automatically played when I hit play). I finally had to go into the program portion and program one episode at a time for the final three episodes on that disc. In addition, there were a few episodes on a couple of discs where the action and sound weren't in sync and others where the disc almost froze. I couldn't locate any scratches, but I imagine they were there. This type of disc just screams for problems and unfortunately it happened on a great set of a great season.

The fourth season of Blue featured a few new characters in the 15th precinct, but the story still revolves around Andy Sipowicz (Dennis Franz) and Bobby Simone (Jimmy Smits), partners in the detective squad. The end of the previous season saw Sipowicz slide back into his drinking habits after the death of his son. While he is able to conquer that demon again, he finds himself dealing with more and more issues in the fourth year as he deals with being a parent again with wife Sylvia Costas (Sharon Lawrence). He helps fellow detective Diane Russell (Kim Delaney when she was at her hottest) keep away from the drinking and works with his partner to put away countless criminals. But he is still Sipowicz, the guy who certainly has some issues and they always seem to come out. Franz played this character to perfection and it would be hard to imagine anyone else playing that role. A highlight for the Sipowicz character in this season was the attraction of Jeri (guest star Debra Christoffersson), a PAA in the office to start the season. Her attraction to Sipowicz and her strange behavior made for some great lines and particularly facial moves from the veteran detective.

Simone and Russell experience a number of growing pains in their relationship. They have to keep their engagement a secret due to department rules, but before the engagement comes along, they run into trouble. Russell's undercover assignment strains the relationship between the pair and Simone's involvement with the FBI, which leads to his being suspended by IAB in the season finale, doesn't help matters any. These two characters always shared good chemistry and it is in good form this season. Simone also inherits an apartment building with many problems of its own, including a jealous son who thought he should've inherited the building when his mother passed (guest star Willlie Garson).

Detective James Martinez (Nicholas Turturro) wins election as the union delegate in the early stages of the season and that plays into some stories throughout the season. Perhaps his best storyline is meeting Gina Colon (guest star Lourdes Benedicto), the squad's new PAA. He is smitten with her from the start and stands by her side after she is brutally attacked. This is a good story line for Martinez, as viewers finally get to see him find luck in love, something that hadn't happened a lot in the previous year.

As for his partner, Greg Medavoy (Gordon Clapp), the opposite is true. The bumbling Medavoy thinks he has found someone to be with, but it turns out that officer Abby Sullivan (guest star Paige Turco) is gay. However, she and her partner ask Medavoy to donate sperm so they can have a baby. The scene at Abby's apartment where the three have dinner has to be one of the best awkward scenes in television history. Clapp played the part to perfection.

Lieutenant Arthur Fancy continues to oversee the detective squad. His biggest storyline of the year happens when he gets pulled over by a racist cop and gets his revenge by first transferring the cop to a black neighborhood and eventually to the 15th. He also is caught in the middle as Simone is dragged through the fire by IAB as the season draws to a close.

Andrea Thompson joined the squad as Detective Jill Kirkendall. She wasn't in the credits this season, but appeared through most of the year. Her character was a refreshing change from Adrienne Lesniak, (Justine Miceli), who's story had kind of petered out at the end of season three.

The shocking final scene makes a viewer anxious for season five to head to DVD. Watching it, I found it hard to believe what happened. Being as it has been 10 years since the episode aired, I don't exactly remember how it turned out in season five, but I know that as the sirens wailed and Simone stood, shocked against the wall, I found myself wishing for season five to come out as soon as possible.

There were a number of great guest stars who would go on to star in other shows: Leland Orser (ER), Christopher Meloni (Law and Order SVU), Ken Jenkins (Scrubs), K Callan (Lois and Clark), Benedicto (Dawson's Creek), and others graced the screen. In a strange turn of events, Currie Graham did a turn as a criminal at the end of the season. In the show's final year, Graham would star as the squad's boss. Just a kind of interesting note.

As I mentioned, there were some great extras on the set and I am anxiously awaiting word on season five. Now, if they'd only do something about the discs.",1156636800,31,5812,4.655945419103314

The first season was on single side disks but seasons 2,3,4 have all been double sided.",1153785600,3,505,4.326315789473684
2545628,5,B000EXDS0C,"If you don't mind David Caruso buy season one.  If you really can't stand the guy, buy seasons 2 thru 4 and so on, as each season is released.  You won't feel like you missed all that much by omitting season 1 from the collection. Beginning with season 2, the acting is better, the chemistry is there and the scripts are fabulous.  Never a dull moment, Jimmy Smitts is superb and Dennis Franz steals the show. A must have series.",1153440000,3,429,4.3375
2545629,5,B000EXDS0C,"Season 3 of ""NYPD Blue"" was my favorite season of my favorite TV show of all time.  That was where ""Blue"" hooked me - throwing me into a drama I had never seen the likes of before on TV - especially network TV.  I suppose there were similar plot elements and storylines explored in past shows or done more graphically in feature films, but even having seen some of this before, I had never seen it done so well and so effectively.  Credit the writing, the performances and a sense of in-your-face real world authenticity - we feel we know these characters - they ARE real.

There was a lot of hoopla surrounding this series when it began over its frank depictions of racism, alcoholism, sex, violence and rough language (all this, of course, is what made it feel like something of a docudrama versus just another police serial); and again in its second season with the whole David Caruso, Jimmy Smits thing.  Season 1 had plenty of great storylines and season 2 was riveting as a season of change; full of new ideas, different from season 1.  It retained the gritty realism of the first season's police stories, but managed to become more involving on a character level.  Season 3 was so spectacularly effective because, unlike season 2, this is not a season of change.  Where season 2 got much of its drama from everything being shaken up, in season 3 we knew and cared about all the characters on a much deeper level.  Sensing this - using this - the writers decided to pull the rug out from under us resulting in some of the best drama I had seen before or since.

Season 4 had some mighty high standards to live up to; and for the most part it does.  It hits the ground running with an episode that immediately sets a few major plot points in motion that will effect the rest of the season:  The squad gets a new PAA named Geri, who sets her sights on Andy, and later she desperately needs his help, Greg's weight concerns introduces him to a cop named Abby who will play a pivotal role in his life this season, Martinez's victory against Vince for delegate leads to pivotal episodes for each of them, Martinez also meets a cute young PAA who will play a major role in his life, Jill Kerkindal joins the squad halfway through the season, Fancy, feeling the victim of racial profiling, is forced to examine his own prejudices, and Bobby asks Diane to marry him and her response sets off a chain of events that becomes the dramatic center of this season.  Andy's issues, although they surface from time to time, take a backseat this season as the dramatic focus is placed more on Simone and Russell, both together and individually, than ever before.  This results in some truly captivating episodes that effect both the individuals involved, as well as those around them:  Russell and her undercover assignment with James Leary gives her character a big overhaul, but it also shows cracks in Simone's generally cool demeanor; you see his weaknesses and what makes him tick.  And Simone, in probably the best story arch of this season, gets screwed by the job and the FBI as he is told to get close to, and do favors for, a former childhood pal turned wiseguy.  This assignment and the secretiveness with which Simone must carry it out, as he gets in deeper and deeper over his head, enrages both Russell and Andy and leads to two terrific episodes: ""Is Paris Burning?"" in which, between a horrible murder of a witness, Simone's tightening noose with IAB, and his own feelings of frustration and helplessness, Andy just loses it.  And the season finale which I remember shocked the hell out of me back when it first aired.  If you are going to try to make fans salivate for a shows return the following season, this is the way to do it.  That was a long summer.

But if there is one, lone standout scene this season that all by itself demonstrates this shows depth, honesty, terrific writing and extraordinary performances; without any flashy nudity, foul language or violence; it is a 3 minute scene between just Andy and Bobby in the locker room (which has over the years became the squads confessional, sanctuary and boxing ring) at the end of ""Where's Swaldo"" where Andy explains in great, sympathetic detail his prejudices and shows a glimmer of hope for overcoming them, while Bobby goes from sensitive, to disgusted, to understanding, to cathartic in his few, but powerful lines of dialogue.  It is a brilliant showcase for these two actors' tremendous talents, as well as a perfect scene to submit as evidence of this show's excellence.  It should also be required viewing in any sociology class.  I bet more people will relate to it than any number of pages trying to explain such a situation in any text book.

As proven by the above mentioned scene and countless others, none of the drama, rough language, sex and cringe-inducing cases on ""Blue"" would be at all effective if we didn't care about these characters so much.  And it is to this show's awesome credit that we do.  Dennis Franz and Jimmy Smits are simply wondrous in their performances.  And everyone is great, but always better when interacting with the two extraordinary leads. And David Milch and the rest of his writers have created a cop show with stories and characters unlike any other.  ""Blue"" goes to some dark places.  As such, it emerges as so much more than a cop show.  It is a fascinating character study of tragic heroes and flawed souls; good people and their problems.  In other words: human beings.

""NYPD Blue"" may not be just another cop show, but it never forgets it is a cop show.  Where the characters and their issues are always front and center the writers never forget to give us compelling cases, interesting mysteries and criminals that range from brilliant, to diabolical, to insane, to comical.  Sometimes this can be said of the fellow officers as well.  In season 4 there are a handful of memorable cases:  topical at the time (and probably still today) Russell and Kirkindal investigate a baby shaken to death, ""Upstairs, Downstairs,"" a classic in which the detective squad (upstairs) investigate one of the cops in the house (downstairs), Simone and Sipowicz investigate the shooting of a uncooperative rap star (Sipowicz's ""bow tie"" line and Simone's response is a classic scene), and in the second episode, as the squad investigates a missing girl, there is a heartbreaking scene in which they discover her whereabouts.  The scene is done as well and as effectively as any of its kind I have ever seen.  As it would for the cops in real life and as it is supposed to, the scene saddens and enrages the viewer in equal measures.

And that is just a brief overview of what season 4 has in store.  Yes, this and all the other emotional drama is just another day for the tormented cops on ""NYPD Blue.""

It is impossible to over-rate this show.  And if you have never seen the show or always blew it off, you simply do not know what you are missing.  Even now it holds up.  FX has followed this mold of gritty, realistic drama with shows like ""The Shield"" and ""Rescue Me.""  While those shows, being on cable, have gone even further in terms of sex, language, and violence, ""Blue"" still feels blue.  You can have all the shock value you want, but it will always be more effective when it is smartly written and happens to characters you truly care about.

And that is, and has always been, ""Blue's"" biggest asset.

The show deserves more attention as a classic and deserves to be remembered as something much more than just an old cop show.  Hopefully with DVD that will be possible.  The 2 and a half year wait between seasons two and three, and a step down in quality and quantity of this boxset, compared with seasons 1 and 2, doesn't make me optimistic that Fox will be doing ""Blue's"" legacy proud.  But at least they are back to putting them out.  For those of us who cherish this great series and want to have these season sets around for the rest our lives, it may just be enough.

Amazon has a great suggestion that you buy this with Season 3.  Do that and you will be getting the two best seasons of the best TV drama ever (at a price slightly better than in stores).  Do yourself a favor and take them up on their offer.  Or get it eslewhere.  But get it.",1150848000,83,8268,4.563008130081301
2545630,4,B000EXDS0C,"After the long, long wait for S3 on DVD, I'm ecstatic that we won't wait long for S4. Hopefully this is just the start of DVD releases on a regular basis to S12.

It is with some disappointment though that I note from the previous reviewer that S4 will continue this new trend from DVD production companies of using double-sided disks. These always look and feel like a cheap option to me and I hate how impossible it is to keep the surfaces clean when using them, since there is no 'safe side'.

Double-sided disks take some of the shine of my enthusiasm. But what the heck - guess it's better than having no season at all.",1146960000,13,624,4.3247863247863245
