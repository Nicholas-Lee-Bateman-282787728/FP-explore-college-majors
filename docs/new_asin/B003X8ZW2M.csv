For one who remembers watching this kind of musical production on 1950s U.S. television back when there were millions of people who'd truly appreciated this kind of musical entertainment ""I'm A Lady Now"" is heartwarming nostalga full of charm & grace, assurrance proof ""light music"" hasn't totally disappeared from living memory.
