2548026,5,B000F1INZS,"This is a beautifully told, engaging series for young and old.  My husband and I watch together with our 9 year old daughter and 4 year old son; we all look forward to each episode.  They are delightfully staged -- haven't found a clunker yet!  I love having my children see the costumes, cultures, landscape and architecture of so many other countries.  I also love that we've had many a lively discussion about the lessons imparted through these simple, gentle folktales.  Highly recommended.",1148428800,34,494,4.903614457831325
2548027,5,B000F1INZS,"Having never viewed this series when it originally aired, I had the privilege of viewing it while the DVDs were in preproduction. The large variety of tales from all over the world is impressive. I also didn't expect the episodes to be so entertaining or well-produced considering native speakers and actors were used to film each tale in the land it came from. This is the most comprehensive and collection of folktales on film for family viewing to date. It is also highly recommended for public libraries and similar collections. With 65 episodes, it is also reasonably priced. In the end, this series is entertaining and educational.

2548028,5,B000F1INZS,"I had watched these episodes as a child. For years I would often think about how I could find & view them again. I would ask others if they recalled the episodes or knew anything about them. I had also forgotten the name of the series. Only one person recalled what I was describing.. I started to think that maybe I was confused about what I had watched, yet I will never forget the cartoon singer in his Robin Hood style clothes- lol. I had a crush on him- yes a cartoon. I finally looked for them on youtube after finding out the name Storybook International and through my research - came to find that I could buy them on Amazon- but only in the USA. I was slightly worried about this at first. I thought there may be problems with it being an overseas sale as I am from the UK. The box set did come later than stated about 7-10 days. Packaged very well.

It was a present for my 41st Birthday. I requested it from my eldest son. The Cartoon man has a different voice & states he is John in America- Yet on one of the stories I was excited to hear the original voice that I had heard sing it as a child- where he was John in England - The voice is slightly country bumpkin style, which made my children laugh. I was very impressed with the DVD box - the Menu on the DVDs is especially impressive. I love it- it has brought back such fond memories. I left it running while I was in the kitchen one day & my children who are 18 & 14 were mesmerised. It kept them glued to the sofa for a full 5-6 stories. We also watched more tonight- so many to watch.... We sit and laugh at some of the stories which are so funny with them being very dated. We always chat about the moral of the story after each tale. One of the tales states it is set in England - yet clearly it was filmed at St Fagons in Wales- very amusing.

In fact I am going to order another set before long, just in case any of mine gets damaged or lost. A bit over the top maybe but it holds so much sentimental happiness for me - I value it greatly. Well worth the money. For those of you who have never watched any of the stories - the narration is so relaxing, interesting imagery from all over the world & well overall -you won't be disappointed.",1298073600,3,2213,4.061784897025172

Instead of racing to the remote like we do when the kids finally get sick of iCarly or Spongebob, we found that we, the parents, were actually enjoying these fairy tales even without the kids!  We kept playing the stories, especially at night since the soft background music and pleasant voice of the narrator created a peaceful atmosphere to settle down to.  Pretty soon, our kids started asking us to put on the dvds and now they know all 65 of the stories!

2548037,5,B000F1INZS,"I came across this title unexpectedly and, based on the previous two reviews, decided to give it a shot.  This set of 10 DVDs covers 65 folktales from around the world, and each episode is filmed on location and acted by indigenous actors.

Our reaction:  We watched our first episode tonight.  After a lovely song introducing the series, we watch A Hundred Cattle from Africa.  My kids loved it and were very intrigued by the people, their way of life, and how they handled problems.  This particular story was narrated, and the narrator spoke the actors' parts as the actors, through facial expressions and gestures, illustrated the story.  The overall effect felt like being read to as the book's pictures came to life.  I suspect all of the episodes are done this way.

What You Get:  The boxed set consists of two cases, each containing five discs which are stacked on top of each other.  I've never seen DVDs packaged this way before.  I'm tempted to buy thin cases to hold each DVD separately to avoid damage.  Also, the set contained a loose disc to replace disc 5 from volume 1.  I'm not sure why - I presume it replaces a defective disc.  I'm glad they corrected the problem before I found out about it the hard way!  The shows are over twenty years old, but the picture and sound are acceptable.

Warning:  I bought this used on Amazon without ANY problem.  However, while researching this title, I discovered that some dealers are confusing ""The Ugly Duckling"" with Storybook International - perhaps because of similar UPC codes?  Beware of prices below $15, because you might get ""The Ugly Duckling"" instead of this - ask before buying.  I paid under $30 for this set and got what I paid for--I'm pleased with my purchase.

Based on one episode, I think this set of folktales is an amazing value.  My children are looking forward to seeing more episodes--and so am I!",1177891200,26,1880,4.64741641337386

My sister and I enjoyed the stories immensely. I introduced my daughters (12 & 11 three years ago) to the stories and they enjoyed them. It was a good way to teach them about how values differ around the world. We also enjoyed the family time.
I now teach at a Primary school and have introduced the stories there and children from Preschool to Standard 5s enjoy them now. The feedback from the children has been very positive. They even like the Narrator! ( I thought this would be a turn off to today's high tech child).

As an adult, I am thoroughly pleased with this wonderful set of stories... being filmed in their country of origin using actors from those countries and a narrator who speaks my language (English).  Really, this couldn't be better than the way it is on these DVDs.  The stories are all timeless tales... and having them in this form can only keep them alive a good while longer.  I can't express how thrilled I am that I grabbed one of these sets at the last minute and can watch these forever.

I sincerely hope this collection gets another release so others can discover them like I did.  Funny, I discovered this myself after having some interest in Shelley Duvall's shows...  I enjoy Fairy Tale Theater, but Storybook is a bit more entertaining for me personally.

I noticed this entire program is on youtube.  I watched the first story, called Clever Manka, and was hooked.  When the set arrived in the mail I watched that one again. Wonderful!  These reminds of stuff I actually did grow up on, like tapes of Superscope Storyteller, or shows like ABC Weekend Specials and Wonderworks on PBS.  Quality television for kids that was so good at the time, even with me approaching 50 I can still sit back and enjoy them even when nostalgia isn't the only thing driving my enjoyment.

Now when it comes on, we all sing it together like some sort of cross-country car tune.  The stories themselves range from incredibly endearing to downright weird.  They provided some great topics for family conversation and an opportunity to discuss issues that make our cultures so alike and so different.

The production quality is much better than I expected.  These shows are very old, but have stood the test of time well.  They are narrated extensively and have the feel of a person reading you a story while you watch it play out.  If your children have an extremely short attention span, or are not used to the style, you may have some difficulty selling them on this set.  Also, there were several of them that kind of freaked my smaller children out a little bit.  There are some odd characters that pop up and will need to be explained to your children.

There is a good representation of countries in this collection and a good variety of stories.  Most stories have a moral lesson to be learned, although some stories are weaker in the lesson.  Overall, I would recommend this collection for home or library purchase.  The DVDs could be individually divided into cases for library patrons to borrow!",1298160000,,676,4.775862068965517
