3876315,5,B002953ERU,"I am a dancer (ballet, contemporary, and lyrical) and have been for many years now. I got very much out of shape after suffering an injury and bought this DVD with the belt to get back in shape before I go back to company in a few months.

I have to say, I LOVE it! I hate exercise (even dance rehearsals sometimes) as a general rule but I love this DVD. The 10-minute solutions thing is a great idea because I can do it in little blips throughout the day. The moves are definitely dance-inspired and are helping me get back into shape for real ballet dancing.

I would HIGHLY recommend this DVD. I love it!

PS-Like the other reviewers said, get it at Wal-Mart instead of online, it is only $15 there. :)",1277424000,6,705,4.246268656716418
3876316,5,B002953ERU,"This DVD is terrific! For the first time ever, I found myself smiling as I was exercising! Andrea does a superb job at explaining the moves as you go along.  You get to practice them all seperately and start bringing each move together after learning a new one. Even though I'm sure I didn't look as smooth and coordinated as Leslie did, I had a great time dancing to the DVD.",1271980800,,376,4.295774647887324
3876317,5,B002953ERU,"i just got this today at walmart. ($15 dollars there instead of 26ish on here)
i got this because i was looking for something to work my abs and such not really to loose weight. and yes i got this because it came with the belt!
hoping this works! but yeah get this at walmart because its about 10-15 dollars cheaper! ( i did this review even though i havnt used it yet but to tell you about the price)",1267315200,,401,4.025
3876318,5,B002953ERU,I usually don't like workout DVD's but with the winter months I cannot go outside. I love this DVD. It's fun and the dance moves are fantastic. I'm not the most coordinated person- but I could do all of these moves. This is a must have.,1265846400,3,236,4.1521739130434785
3876319,5,B002953ERU,"I have several 10 Minute Solution DVD's which I enjoy, so I thought a new one would be in order to give some variety.  This one contained the weighted belt which I wasn't sure would be helpful.  Believe me--the belt is helpful!  The belt really works the core, obliques, and hips, and I have started using it with all my 10 Minute Solution dance DVD's.  The dance routines are fun and I am enjoying a different instructor.",1264809600,4,422,4.441558441558442
3876320,5,B002953ERU,"The instructor, Andrea, is very pleasant to watch and to listen to. The music and choreography is an A+.  The music is perfect for each segment and is a great motivator.  I enjoy her choreography, it reminds me of showgirl type dancing. Not too many steps like Petra Kolber's.  Lots of hip and core movements to take advantage of the weighted belt, which is not too heavy-it's always an option. This type of dance is in my rotation of 10 Minute Solutions and one of my favorite cardio workouts, plus it helps me with my coordination and memory.",1261180800,14,544,4.530612244897959
3876321,5,B002953ERU,"I am not a dancer, but this was fun and easy.  In fact, I thought it was so easy it probably wasn't doing me any good as far as being ""real"" exercise.  Two days later I learned how wrong I had been!  My abs and obliques definitely let me know they had been worked.  I have a new respect for dancers, indeed.  No wonder they have such great bodies.  The instructor teaches you each small step of choreography and then adds another and another until you have done an entire routine.  I exercise 4-6 times a week with purpose.  I am over 40 and about as coordinated as a water buffalo, but I enjoyed this dvd.  It is a fun worthwhile workout to add to your collection!  Oh, the weight belt is a good addition, although it's only 1-2 lbs or so.  It is also adjustable.  Sometimes I wear it to walk.",1255219200,45,794,4.151315789473684
8357491,1,B002953ERU,"disk never played, checked it for scratches perfectly fine. Checked on 2 different DVD players. Had different packaging then another seller for the same set that played fine.",1492819200,,174,5.25
8357492,5,B002953ERU,I LOVE THIS DVD. By far my favorite workout! Well worth the money.,1408579200,,66,4.153846153846154
8357493,4,B002953ERU,"I am not much of a dancer but I really liked the variety in this workout.  Andrea is a pleasant instructor.  I knocked a star off because she was not perfect in equally working the right and left side.  I found that three times.  It is noticeable for me because I use 2 lb wrist weights in addition to the weighted belt.  If you don't think this is hard enough, try adding wrist weights, especially during the Ballet Sculpt.  Another plus about this workout is that it does not take up much space.",1359504000,2,497,4.290322580645161
8357494,2,B002953ERU,I only give this two cause you do actually get a workout but only cause your trying to keep up with her. Not the easiest workout to follow.,1358985600,,139,4.0
8357495,1,B002953ERU,I ordered a DVD and it doesn't play in any of my dvd players.  It says that it cannot play in this format in this region or state.  I have never heard of such a thing and I am really upset that I can't play it.  I would love to have it replaced with one that can play in the USA.  Thank you.,1305590400,,291,3.5714285714285716
8357496,5,B002953ERU,This workout was very fun to do and I sweat a lot while doing it.  She is fun to watch.  It is a bit fast paced but after a while you learn the moves.  I use the belt and when I take it off I feel like I just removed 20 lbs.off my body!  Its a great workout and I love that I can choose to do as many 10 min. workouts as I want daily.,1297814400,,334,3.3552631578947367
8357497,4,B002953ERU,"The ""10 Minute Solution"" series never seems to disappoint as it consistently releases entertaining yet effective workouts.  ""Dance Your Body Thin"" was no exception as it's easy-to-follow and fun dance moves made working out a breeze.  Andrea Leigh Rogers is a very friendly and motivating instructor that never misses a beat;  her enthusiasm is contagious, and she is a really good teacher.  Also included with this DVD is a 2 lb. toning belt to snap around your waist.  It is supposed to work your abs while you're doing the workout, but I honestly can't say I felt it do much.  Like with all ""10 Minute Solution"" DVDs, this one was divided into 5 sections which were each 10 minutes.  The sections are:

Smooth and Sexy Moves - This routine had a jazzy and broadway feel to it with flowing moves that add a lot hip movement.  You will do some hip dips, hip swings, grapevines with throw downs and throw ups, broadway kicks, and more in this rather simple routine.

Dance Toner - This section is not a dance routine and was what I felt to be the weakest of all the workouts.  I didn't feel much of my body toning, therefore not really getting a good workout.  You start out with some hip isolations for your warm up before moving onto chest isolations.  Next you do shoulder rolls using the whole arm.  The rest of the workout is mostly full of plies, squats, and lunges with a few added on arms and leg extensions.

Get Fit Club Mix - With techno music in the background, I found this routine to be composed mostly of house and hip hop dance moves.  It was really funky and one of the best of the five sections.  Moves included are heel pushes with arms, raise the roofs, walks in a circle with arm swings, kick ball changes, body rolls, and more.

Cardio Dance Party - This was the last cardio dance segment, and it had a jazz funk feel to it.  It combined strong steps with flowing moves.  Some of the steps were lunges back, knee crunches, fast and powerful chest isolations side to side, throw downs, and more.

Ballet Sculpt - Once again, this segment was not a dance routine but rather toning, dance-inspired moves, and unlike the other section like this (Dance Toner), I actually felt this one.  Pretty much the entire time you are doing some form of plie or squat with arms lifted.  I not only felt my thighs and butt work but also my shoulders.

Overall, this DVD is highly recommended by me as a fun dance workout that's not too complex mixed with some rather basic toning work.  I kind of felt like the belt didn't do anything, but that may be different for someone else.  It's not the most challenging workout I've ever done, but it was still pretty amazing, and I would definitely give this DVD a thumbs up.",1295136000,3,2722,4.459514170040486
8357498,5,B002953ERU,"this is my very first review!

when i first watched this video, the moves looked a bit silly and more jazz oriented than ""club mix"" or ""dance party"".  however, do the dvds to feel the burn as the choreography seems to really concentrate on getting the most out of each move and focuses on that core (you will feel your abs!)  this will probably be the most effective dance video you will own even though you probably will not be taking any of these moves to the club. lol.  oh, and the belt does work!  I have Andrea's other 10 minute pilates video which is probably my most favorite video!  i'm a fan!

more videos Andrea!",1289865600,2,623,4.318965517241379
8357499,5,B002953ERU,"I think this is a good exercise dance DVD. I am somewhat of a dance beginner and do not find the moves too hard. She doesn't give you a whole lot of time to learn the steps but they are also not that hard and sometimes I improvise. Have only done the full dvd twice. It is divided into 10min sections, of course, with 5 different sections. Each section has a brief stretch at the end so if you are continuing to the next one, it's not like you will cool down much before you begin the next one which is good otherwise I would have skipped to the next segment immediately. I do wish there was a final 10min stretch session at the end but I guess all 10 min solutions DVD's only have 5 segments. I enjoyed the first two segments (#1 Smooth and Sexy Moves and #2 Dance Toner) and worked up sweat. The third section ""Get Fit Club Mix"" is my least favorite because I think the moves are pretty silly and I would not even want someone looking at me doing that section. But that's just me. Maybe 20 somethings and younger would like it. It's obvious her dance training is mostly ballet and jazz and I think she could have left the club mix to someone with better moves but she is a very likeable instructor and never irritating the way she speaks. However, it's only 10 min and I don't have to do that section but I want to do the whole 50 min so I suck it up. The 4th section ""cardio dance party"" is pretty good and the final ""ballet sculpt"" is my favorite. You do not need ballet training for it. Just be prepared for your arms to ache from holding them up so much.

Also, the weighted belt is helpful and I do think it increases the burn. It is not hard to dance with it on and it is adjustable so that it can fit a good range of body types. It says you can wear it on the waist or hips. It is more comfortable on the hips and that's where the instructor wears it too. This DVD is pretty fun and I will keep using it, probably more than others I have. The music is appropriate for each section and the studio is nice and not distracting. You don't need a lot of space for this workout either. I recommend this DVD to anyone looking for a dance workout. However, I bought this  DVD at WalMart for around $15 so it is definitely overpriced here.",1288224000,4,2239,4.097949886104783
8357500,1,B002953ERU,"I just did this DVD for the first time.  It skipped once.  But my main problem was in the first segment there is a lot of ""step touch"" which I don't consider dancing.  This DVD may be fine for people with zero dance experience, but I do have some dance experience and was so bored I couldn't finish it.",1283472000,3,302,4.084745762711864
