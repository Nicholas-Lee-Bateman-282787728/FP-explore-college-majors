4706083,4,B005HWAOCU,"Only 4 strs, although this is very important, historical and superb material. But with a complete set on the way that includes ALL SIX episodes with the Stones it seems a bit silly to buy this one now, you either miss out on some fantastic tracks (Around & Around, Time is on my Side, Gimme Shelter, Love in Vain, Honky tonk Women) and an extra booklet with many photo's and a ton of other entertaining material or will find yourself buying that one as well and find that this first release is a bit superfluous.

The extra star goes to the other set, for completeness.",1317427200,11,569,4.419047619047619
4706084,5,B005HWAOCU,"Can't wait for this release on Tuesday! Some of my favorite songs are on this collection including Paint It Black & Gimme Shelter.  The best part is seeing Mick, Keith, Brian and Charlie when they were so young and still making a name for themselves.  This is a great collection as we approach almost the 50th anniversary of The Rolling Stones.",1317340800,7,344,4.622950819672131

Anyway the product itself does not have all of their performances on the ed Sullivan show so its not complete I really wanted to see time in on my side...",1529539200,,283,3.982456140350877

8473740,5,B005HWAOCU,"This great dvd is a time voyage to the past, to an era era when the Rolling Stones were at their Very Best, with their five original members! Five Stars!",1336348800,,153,4.133333333333334
8473741,5,B005HWAOCU,"I really love these Ed Sullivan sets. The complete shows with commericals
give you the feeling of excitement the audience felt at home and in the studio
during that time frame.
I'm a bit confused why they have packaged these programs in  3,4 or 6 shows. Maybe they thought the Stones would be hard to market. That can't be true, just look at how successful Keith Richards book as been!
It's still great rock n roll history, and Stones fans will not be disappointed.
Oh..I bought the 4 show pack and I'm still kicking myself...go for the 6 pack.",1321142400,2,544,4.494949494949495
8473742,5,B005HWAOCU,"i bought this item thru AMAZON because if it say's Rolling Stones, then i am on it.  they are fantastic and full of energy and great to watch at any time.  have not had time to watch, but i just had to have it.  whatever they do, together or separate, is worth the time and money it takes.",1320278400,,289,3.9482758620689653
8473743,3,B005HWAOCU,"It seems weird not only that this ""4 show"" set is being released when the Stones COMPLETE Ed Sullivan show appearances (6 shows) is coming in a few weeks, but consider this: the two missing shows are their FIRST (10/25/64) and LAST (11/23/69) ones !

Obviously - if you're interested enough to buy this one, a complete set would be more appealing. If they HAD TO put out two sets (though I can't fathom WHY), it might have been better to split them up as ""Volume 1"" and ""Volume 2"" without the overlap.

Again - great stuf on here, but (excuse the cliche`) ""it'll leave you wanting more"". Go get the full one.",1317513600,6,608,4.371681415929204
