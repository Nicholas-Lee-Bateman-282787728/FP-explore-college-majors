540904,4,6303052487,"Of course, I love the movie, the plot, and everything to do with it.  Lee Van Cleef is outstanding!  However, the DVD sound quality is miserable!  It sounds like those cheap Chinese imports about Kung Fu.  The quality of the video is also poor.  I know it's not my DVD player, because (1) my player is brand new-high quality, and (2) right after I saw this one I put in the ""Hang Em High"" DVD, and the sound and video quality was quite good.  So, in summary, I love the movie and Van Cleef, but I hate the video and audio quality on the DVD.  Can't they clean it up with all the high-tech equipment that they have?  If they do, I will buy the cleaned-up version.",1011139200,16,662,4.15748031496063
540905,3,6303052487,"Sergio Leone defines the genre, but there are other Italian directors who know their way around the spaghetti western. If they have Lee Van Cleef to work with, well, the audience is in for a really good time.
Death Rides a Horse is the relatively unknown masterpiece in an era that produced westerns of varying quality. It has all the plot prerequisites: blood and mayhem galore, a wrong the needs righting, and an interesting relationship between the avenging good guy and the man who crosses his path with an agenda of his own that needs taking care of.
The music is quirky as only Ennio Morricone knows how make it; and the photography, if you are lucky enough to watch a good copy, has that hot, stark quality favored by the directors of these films. The acting is another matter. At one end of the spectrum is John Phillip Law who has the personality and delivery of a piece of cardboard, on the other, Lee Van Cleef who is grand mastered of the sinister glance and soft-spoken line. It's Van Cleef's movie all the way, right down to his last gesture of self-sacrifice in the end.
It's a shame that this movie has been allowed to deteriorate, but Turner Broadcasting has a good copy. Maybe if we leave enough requests on the TCM web site, they will run it for us sometime.",997660800,16,1277,4.508620689655173
540906,4,6303052487,"As you see the spagheti westerns are geting very popular nowdays. I think that this kind of story telling is very rearly shown on the sp. spoof,like FFDM,whitch is an other great example withe two great acters: CLINT EASTWOOD & LEE VAN CLEEF.with similar story. I rememberd when i was 12 year old when my father showed me for the first time DEATH RIDES A HORSE on VHS.I felt in love with the movie,even though after is sew THE GOOD ,THE BAD AND THE UGLY,whitch is an other great SERGIO LEONE'S western. The film is classified as one of the best non-Leone SP- WEST with consistent story flow, superb sondtrack and good use of time element,mutch like Leone's sense of rythm. Vincenzoni did his best to apply Leone recipe for that film, and assigned many of Leone's crew members like:MARIO BREGA, LUIGI PISTILLI, JOSE TORES,ANTHONY DAWSON etc. LUCIANO VINCENZONI is the screenwrighter. One of the best screenwriters of the sp- genre. LUCIANO VINCENZONI was also the writer of SERGIO LEONE's two great westerns: For a few dollars more & The Good The Bad & The Ugly. DEATH RIDES A HORSE ,the director GIULIO PETRONI was supervised by VINCENZONI up on UA's directions. What i can sagest is that the copy of DEATH RIDES A HORSE on DVD is of poor print ,it should be  sheame when you compere with the other LEONE'S westerns on DVD ,when you look at there quality. I can count if the studio re- releases with mutch better print and better sound, because this movie stands one of the best classics of NON - LEONE'S spaghetti westerns at all times.

In the film, he was imprisoned for 15 years for being involved in a robbery, deaths, and murder. Now released, he wants revenge against the gang that turned him in, at least payment from each of $15,000, a thousand for each year.
During the event fifteen years earlier, a father, mother, and daughter were shot. The two women were raped. The son, just a boy, hid and was not seen by the hoard, although when they left, one of them saved him from the burning house, for the hoard took what they wanted and burnt the rest.
Now fifteen years later, the boy is grown and very proficient with guns. But he lacks many gunman skills, such as not shooting all of his bullets before he is certain there are no more outlaws and checking who is behind him.
Since both he and Cleef have the same goals, he wants to join Cleef, but Cleef does not want him because of his lack of the mentioned skills. So each goes alone with the same mission and run into each other often.
The film has lots of action and some humor. I watched it twice.",1474416000,,1257,4.330508474576271

541148,3,6303052487,"DEATH RIDES A HORSE

Released in 1967 and directed by Giulio Petroni, Death Rides a Horse is a Spaghetti Western about an orphaned boy who grows up (John Phillip Law) to seek vengeance on the savage thugs who slaughtered and raped his family members. He teams-up, sort of, with an ex-convict (Lee Van Cleef) whos after the same scumbags.

This has most of the attributes of Italo Westerns: Shot in Spain, poor dubbing, grim caricatures rather than three-dimensional characters, comic book violence, women existing solely to be abused, revenge (or greed) motif, awkward editing and a quirky score by the incredible Ennio Morricone. Both Law and Van Cleef are fitting and effective for their roles but, curiously, Law is typically lambasted by critics as wooden while Van Cleef is extoled. Actually, Law played the role as written and directed; sort of a Man with No Name type who constantly chews on a toothpick.

While this is a worthwhile Spaghetti Western its hampered by a one-dimensional revenge story, over-length (for the thin plot), a lack of any prominent female character (and no notable secondary characters either) and a half-interesting/half-dull vibe where you find your mind periodically wandering. However, the relation that develops between the two protagonists is good. Reportedly, Death Rides a Horse was a favorite of Quentin Tarantino and it influenced his Kill Bill.

The movie runs 114 minutes and was shot in Spain.

GRADE: C+

====================

CRY BLOOD, APACHE

Released in 1970 and directed by Jack Starrett, ""Cry Blood, Apache"" is a low-budget American Western about a group of white dirtbags with gold fever who murder a camp of Apaches while allowing a squaw (Marie Gahva) to live in order to take 'em to a gold mine. Meanwhile a relative of the captive, a silent brave (Marcus Rudnick), tracks them down and gets vengeance one by one. Jody McCrea plays the only redeemable person of the bunch while the director plays the hypocritical Bible-quoting nutjob. The burly bearded guy was Leif Garrett's father, believe it or not.

This is actually a late 60s/early 70s exploitation thriller in disguise. Some of the Apache's torture methods, like hanging a person upside down in a stream and placing a bag with a deadly snake over someone's head, are rather chilling without being overly graphic. ""Cry Blood, Apache"" is a barbaric revenge yarn produced by the protagonist Jody McCrea, who enlisted his dad, Joel McCrea, from retirement to play the old-aged version of his character in the prologue and epilogue for (I guess) name recognition.

The director went on to better things, like 1975's ""Race with the Devil,"" but here he was obviously hampered by the low-budget and the movie comes across inept in some ways (like some of the editing, acting, dubbing & dialogue), which will spur a lot of viewers to hit the 'stop' button (or switch channels). But the film has some rewarding elements despite the tediousness and meaninglessness of it all. For instance, you can't beat the gritty realism. The main characters come across as a group of degenerates with gold fever in the desert, with the questionable exception of Pitcalin (McCrea). Their disheveled and torn clothing looks right. And Rudnick is quite credible as the laconic, merciless and torturous Apache warrior. The obvious question is: Why is Pitcalin riding with these moral-less swine? I suppose because he's desperate and needs the money. While he obviously laments the needless murders, he probably ""writes them off"" as expected collateral damage.

""Cry Blood, Apache"" is gritty, dismal, desolate, inhospitable, nihilistic, torturous, tedious and inept. It's also unforgettable.

The film runs 82 minutes and was shot in Arizona and Sequoia National Forest.

It's an excellent tale of revenge with great gun fights, great acting and a wonderful movie score by Ennio Morricone (I didn't spell it right but I don't care to look it up so kiss my fat a$$).

541774,4,6303052487,"A highly-regarded second-tier Spaghetti western, this one stands out to me for several reasons, but first and foremost the clever braiding of two Western archetypes into one narrative thread.

John Philip Law plays a young man, haunted by the rape and murder of his entire family that he witnessed as a child. After being rescued from the burning farmhouse by a mysterious stranger, the clock is turned many years forward, and we witness him training his shooting skills in a scene that presages many kung-fu training sequences we'd see on screen later in the decade. While that sequence is very much euro-western in feel, Law's character is pure Oater - he ""reckons"" a lot, he drops lines like ""before anybody kills me, they gotta get my okay. And I don't think I'm gonna give it to 'em!""

He crosses paths with Lee Van Cleef, a mysterious gunslinger straight out of jail and hot on the trail of those who framed him. Cleef's character is Pure Spaghetti West, and that's the clever hook of this film - the kid is the old school, pure-Oater, twangy white-hat western hero, and the oldtimer is the New Wave.

There's tension, they cross swords more than one, and each wants his pound of flesh without the help of the other, but over the course of the film they naturally become a team. The tension comes in knowing that they'll have to settle with each other down the road, if they both live long enough. It's reminiscent of the even better THE AVENGING EAGLE that way.

Well worth a couple of hours of your weekend afternoon, and Wild East gives us a nice-looking transfer.",1402185600,6,1573,4.64748201438849

541779,4,6303052487,"Back in the '60s, in the wake of Sergio Leone's wildly successful Dollar trilogy, came instant clamor in the international market for more Spaghetti westerns. One of the better ones is 1967's Death Rides a Horse (a.k.a. Da uomo a uomo). It's a gem of a shoot-'em-up, a diamond-in-the-rough that features a typically understated yet masterful Lee Van Cleef performance, Giulio Petroni's sweeping storytelling skills, and Ennio Morricone's distinctive, moody score - three elements that more than compensate for John Phillip Law's rather stiff acting.

I don't know that Death Rides a Horse has ever gotten its just propers. It at least has enough swagger that it influenced a young Quentin Tarantino, so much so that, in Kill Bill Vol. 1, Tarantino lifted (or paid homage to) several flourishes from the 1967 western, such as those revelatory moments in which our young hero identifies one of his family's killers and a flashback scene superimposes over his face (same thing happens whenever the Bride recognized one of her betrayers). Tarantino also uses Morricone's memorable theme music for when the Bride challenged O-Ren Ishii at the House of Blue Leaves. Morricone - who, between 1964 and 1968, scored over 80 pictures - had professed himself flattered over Tarantino's almost reverential nods, so it's all good.

The plot dusts off that old bit about a terrible wrong that needs righting: Fifteen years after the slaughter of his family and a trail gotten cold, a driven Bill Meceita (Law) at last embarks on his mission of vengeance. During his quest, he continuously crosses paths and matches wits with Ryan (Van Cleef), a savvy ex-con with a score of his own to settle.

After years and countless hours of target practice, Bill has developed into an expert marksman. Except that, time and again, Ryan goes on to demonstrate that Bill still requires tutoring in the art of killing. Ryan's tips include sage advice such as don't waste bullets when one would do, make damn sure no one sneaks up behind, boots behind a curtain don't mean the ambusher is behind the curtain, etc. But Ryan fails to mention the one about watching out for trap doors in shady bankers' offices, but that may be too esoteric. Lee Van Cleef is once again on point. He's so good at playing these sinister, ambiguous roles. Will his character turn on Bill? Or will he back the kid's play? Van Cleef conveys levels of meaning with just a casual gesture or an ominous squint. Yeah, he owns the movie. But there's also something to director Giulio Petroni's knack for propping him in such interesting widescreen backdrops. Petroni has certainly got a stylish eye for detail. Add in the flavoring of Morricone's amazing film score, and Death Rides a Horse, thematically and tonally, achieves something that Sergio Leone himself would be mighty proud of.",1394323200,,2829,4.951578947368421

542083,4,6303052487,"Death Rides a Horse (1967) is a fun spaghetti western from Italian director Giulio Petroni which features another competent performance from spaghetti western movie star Lee Van Cleef. This is another preeminent Van Cleef Spaghetti western. Lee Van Cleef is the real justification to see this rather debilitated spaghetti western.

The storyline is commonplace, one of the typical and ordinary for a spaghetti western. Cleef is an old, favorable bad guy character turned virtuous. John Phillip Law has revenge on his mind, he goes after a group of vicious killers who slaughtered his whole family when he was a boy.

I expected a disappointment of a spaghetti western film when I began watching, and since the first thing you notice is the horrible print and unpleasant sound, I thought I was in for a stinker but it's an okay spaghetti western.

542088,3,6303052487,"At some point, I realized Netflix (or was it Amazon?) was recommending movies to me because they were connected to Quentin Tarantino. The spaghetti western in question here was mentioned in Quentin's KILL BILL. As a matter of fact, part of the score was also stolen, and bits of the revenge story ripped off. At least Tarantino was up front about what he was doing. I guess. In DEATH RIDES A HORSE, (the more popular title for this flick,) Director Giulio Petroni (who never directed much else,) casts perennial fan favorite Lee Van Cleef in one of his first starring roles. If you don't already know... There's never been anyone in a western more believable than Van Cleef. John Phillip Law is also surprisingly good, as our other bloodthirsty revenge-seeker. I dare you to watch this one and not become invested in seeing the bad guys get what is owed them, and the friendship/rivalry between the men pursuing them. A simple story, but well-paced and plotted. At least one scene you won't soon forget. And a hell of an ending.",1367798400,7,1028,4.716666666666667

542185,4,6303052487,"My late night movie last night was ""Death Rides A Horse"" starring Lee Van Cleef and John Phillip Law. It was a Spaghetti Western and came from a large collection-set of DVDs I've had for at lest five years. I'd ran out of other movies and had to go to the lower-regarded archives. However, this was a fairly good movie, I must admit. It had the standard Spaghetti Western settings of an ultra-dry and desolate landscape, windy and dusty weather, stark and desolate little towns and some really bad hombres. Almost everybody wore rumpled and dirty clothing and looked like they'd smell bad. It was not the kinda place you'd wanna be.

The movie got off to a good start with a murder and sexual assault on a family in which everyone ended up killed except for a small boy who observed the atrocity. Van Cleef (one of the perpetrators) took mercy on the boy, took him out of his burning house and set him free. Fifteen years later, Van Cleef was released from prison (for another offense) and returned to the town. The young boy was now a grown man (John Phillip Law) and had grown quite handy with a gun, and was looking to right the score on his childhood catastrophe, if he could only find the killers. Van Cleef and Law met and become sometime friends and allies against some really bad dudes. One by one, Law managed to track down and do away with his family's killers. Van Cleef was a vital aid on more than one occasion. Finally, the young man realized that Van Cleef was present, albeit late, at his family's demise, which created a thorny moral dilemma.

It's an interesting movie and rather well done. I'd have to say that it's a rather good Spaghetti Western that ranks somewhat below the Clint Eastwood sagas, but is not too far off. There's a lot of gunfire. A lot of people die. There's a lot of violence and destruction. The filming and sound are good, at least on the version I watched, although it looked as if the DVD was made from a well-worn copy of the film.

542187,5,6303052487,"The release of Director Guilio Petroni's 'DEATH RIDES A HORSE' aka 'DA UOMO A UOMO'-1967 is a revelation. It took Wild East Productions to release it after all these years of poor pan and scan budget DVD's in its original aspect ratio of 2.35 and it shows the contempt that MGM/UA has for its own product.  The company is sitting on alot of Spaghetti titles but it took Wild East to give this film its just due.  Released after the success of Director Sergio Leone's Dollar trilogy, it helped make Lee Van Cleef a star after he decided to stay on in Italy and the films storyline also resembles Director Tonino Valeri's 'DAY OF ANGER' aka 'I GIORNI DELL'IRA'-1967.  The brilliant photography in startling close ups by Carlo Carlini is enhanced by the crispness of the transfer making the opening massacre sequence a cross between Horror and Western Gothic.  John Phillip Law is also quite good and would go on to cult stardom in Director Mario Bava's 'DANGER,DIABOLIK'-1967 and Director Roger Vadim's 'BARBARELLA'-1968.  You'll also spot burly Mario Brega, villainous Luigi Pistilli, and British actor Anthony Dawson as the brutal Manina.  The music score by Ennio Morricone meshes the operatic storyline culminating in the brilliant climactic showdown between Van Cleef and Law. The assistant direction is by Giancarlo Santi who would go on to direct Van Cleef in 'THE BIG SHOWDOWN' aka 'THE GRAND DUEL' -1972 also available in a beautiful transfer by Wild East. The release also has a picture gallery, US trailers and TV spots and a nice audio interview with Law in 1996 commenting on some great behind the scenes stories and experiences.

Here's the scoop. A young boy stands by and watches as his father, mother and sister are murdered by some thugs. Their farm house is set on fire and he's pulled out, at the last minute, by someone and avoids death. Fifteen years later he's working on his shooting skills to find those bad guys and do them in. Lee VanCleef is just out of prison after fifteen years and wants to do in his bad guy buddies who double crossed him. Turns out both men are looking for the same men. They form an uneasy alliance.

As far as Spaghetti Westerns go this isn't bad. It's directed well enough and things like editing and sound mixing are pro level. The problem is that Leone is a tough act to follow. He had great, colorful characters in his movies. He also knew how to frame a shot. His movies looked great. Here, the two main characters are lackluster. VanCleef is Okay but he seems to be the same character as he was in ""For a Few Dollars More"" and ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly."" John Phillip Law is wooden as the hero. He has nowhere near the charisma Eastwood had. A few of the secondary characters you'd recognize from the Leone films. The story is a simple revenge tale. There's nothing particularly clever or engaging about it. It's directed decently, but nothing to make you go ""Wow!.""

542253,5,6303052487,"So begins this superb Italian Western, with the rape and murder of a simple God-fearing peasant family.  The slaughter at Maseda Ranch.  Yet they made one mistake - the criminals left behind a 10 year old son, who remembers everything.

  Now 15 years have passed, and the lad is a 25 year old young man, on a quest for revenge...  This is one of the finest Italian Westerns, of the more serious variety; yet not completely without the eccentric humor that so typically characterizes them.  It is quite dry here, though.  The young man, ""Bill"", really assuming the position of ""the man with no name"", has blood that runs as blue as the sky, and with intelligence to match.  But what he lacks in experience, and to an extent, knowledge, is made up by the friendship he strikes with an elder ex-convict, Ryan.

  ""Revenge is a dish that has to be eaten cold.""  And as the years have passed from that night at Maseda Ranch, the criminality, the debt, has in no wise decreased.  The debt to sin does not expire.  And as time goes by, though occasionally gently annoyed with the young man's precociousness, Ryan develops a growing respect for him...  Watching this powerful, unusual film, I have found myself musing, at times, on what is really is valuable in life; and this is really to the director's credit...  The whole movie is presented through the vision of the young man, played by John Phillip Law in a remarkable performance, Lee Van Cleef is Ryan, and with a music score by Ennio Morricone, this is a Western not to be missed!  As an Italian Western, it is possibly only exceeded by Sergio Leone's masterwork ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"".

This is another preeminent Van Cleef Spaghetti western.  Lee Van Cleef is the real justification to see this rather debilitated spaghetti western.

The storyline is commonplace, one of the typical and ordinary for a spaghetti western. Cleef is an old, favorable bad guy character turned virtuous.  John Phillip Law has revenge on his mind, he goes after a group of vicious killers who slaughtered his whole family when he was a boy.

I expected a disappointment of a spaghetti western film when I began watching, and since the first thing you notice is the horrible print and unpleasant sound, I thought I was in for a stinker but it's an okay spaghetti western.

However, Van Cleef brings a real humanity to his role as the wisened, elder outlaw helping out the youngster; and there are a few moments of distinct charm between Van Cleef and Law. No one ever accused Mr. Law of being a good actor, and he is certainly a bit stiff here; but he is not bad enough to be a hindrance, and his piercing blue eyes go a long way in helping his cause. The pics runs 2 hours but moves along briskly. There are always a bunch of people milling about each scene everywhere throughout the film, which suggests a big budget. The riding and fight stunts are all well done and the music by genre fave Ennio Morricone is exquisitely haunting and suspenseful.

542372,4,6303052487,"I am no expert in the genre, but lets tick off the boxes here - Ennio Morricone score, morally dubious heroes, revenge driven story, nasty Mexican bandit baddies who laugh at anything remotely unpleasant, terrible dubbing -yep, must be a Spaghetti Western!

If you are a fan of Spaghetti Westerns, this is among the best, and if you have just been tempted by the Clint Eastwood / Sergio Leone, then I thoroughly recommend this as the next step (right after `My Name is Nobody', the next best thing to a Leone Western).

This is a fast moving revenge Western with an apparently simple plot filled out with memorable characters and situations, and a genually satisfying conclusion.  Sure, it does not have the style or panache of Leone, and Morricone's score is not his best - but a less than perfect score from Morricone is still better than most others, and it is a memorable distinctive musical treat.  The alternating themes of strumming guitar and choral voices bring his usual uniqueness to the movie, and the movie benefits greatly from it.

The story follows a young boy who witnesses the brutal rape and murder of his mother and sister, and murder of his father.  He grows up as a respectable community member (John Phillip Law), but shuns responsibility while he harbours one thing in mind - revenge.  This lies latent until he crosses paths with Ryan (Lee van Cleef), an ex con whose similar drive of revenge seems to coincide with Ryans goal.  They form an uneasy alliance which teeters between help and competition to be the one who kills the bad guys.. mostly competing to make sure they get there first.

The movie is not fantastically shot, but not bad - the story is good, but quite epic - what redeems the movie above all else, is the fantastic turn by Lee van Cleef, who easily equals his work in Leone's Westerns here.  This is the mode he was seemingly born to play, and he has immense screen presence, especially with all those close ups of his craggy but clear eyes..  Law on the other hand is a charisma free zone, and the movies weakest point - you can almost imagine how those shoes filled by a greater or even more interesting actor could have made this a classic - but Law walks through the role failing to convince - his only acting trait seems to be when his eyes go wide and his body goes rigid, and you know he has seen one of the bad guys!  The rest of the cast are mainly bad guy ciphers, but you can spot a familiar face or two (Mario Brega - who appeared in every one of Leone's movies I am aware of..).

There are some great set pieces - not as epic as they might be, but inventive - the final shootout in the middle of a dust storm must have been a nightmare to shoot, but is very effective - best of all, the director does not linger too long, and gives the film a nice pace which make the movie a well balanced thoroughly enjoyable 1hour 50 minutes.

In short - no extras, but a cracking good film, with an excellent transfer (hardly a blemish on it).  Lee van Cleef is on top form, and it's one of Spaghetti Westerns finest moments.",1170460800,3,3071,4.420212765957447
542373,4,6303052487,"Death Rides a Horse is one that Spaghetti Western fans (and fans of Lee Van Cleef) would thoroughly enjoy. The FILM is most watchable (read below about the DVD), and Van Cleef is at his best in this one, playing a thug who is betrayed by his compadres. We usually see him playing the ultimate bad guy in most of his films, with his knife-deep stare filling the screen. At times, though, Van Cleef exposes his compassionate side for just a tease, and then just as quickly masks his inner humanity behind The Stare, as he plays Ryan, who arm-wrestles throughout the movie with stubborn youngster Bill, played by John Phillip Law, who has foresaken his lady and his life by embracing only revenge - and a single spur - after watching his father murdered, and then bearing witness to his mother and older sister brutalized at the hands of an out-of-control gang, greedy for gold.

The matchup between Ryan and Bill is one that plays itself out quite well, as Ryan acts as surrogate father, dishing out advice through some memorable quotes, teaching young Bill with his words and actions. Bill's anger is worn heavily on his sleeve, while Ryan steadily and calmly works out his own dishes of revenge, suppressing his anger even better than his empathy for Bill, which he touches on even as the pair first meet. Phillip Law was okay, but not thoroughly convincing as a bitter young man who witnessed his family's killing. Every once in a while, he might could have done just another take or two.

I wouldn't want to go deeper into reviewing the movie, except that there's a nice plot twist somewhere inside the film. Many of the actors seen in this 1968 film have been in films by the great Sergio Leone. It seems that there was a core of actors who performed in a number of Italian Westerns, and for good reason: the chemistry was there. Add a good dose of Ennio Morricone film scores, and you have the potential for a quite watchable film. Most spaghettis would crumble if not for Morricone music, which acts as an unseen, yet incredibly talented main character.

Once in a while, the dialog (like Bill's hokie delivery: ""I'll find out who he is. If he is who I think he is...get ready to get mad"") detracts from the pace of Death Rides a Horse (that line makes me want to Kill Bill, myself), but the overall storyline works well enough to entertain Spaghetti Western fans. There are very few plot holes to discover in the film, which has an air of dread or darkness throughout much of its length. A lighter moment always seems to pop in just when the viewer might like to come up for air (like the old man who offers Bill a kiss).

For those concerned about bad or unbelievable endings, Death Rides delivers without disappointment.

Now, for the DVD: Sadly, there seems to be no region 1 release that does this nice yet overlooked film, justice. Mine, which is a 2-4-1 DVD with ""God's Gun"" on the same side, and ""Quality"" as the title logo, is horribly lacking in anything but bad quality, perhaps one of the worst DVD productions I have EVER seen. The letterboxed picture is cropped to pan/scan, and there is not one frame that has any kind of decent image quality with respect to color, tone, or saturation. Its terribly washed out and either too contrasty and bright, or muddy and dark, without any texture. And in some scenes, the image degrades to a pixelated mess, which you'll see in the opening scene, and it returns of and on throughout the presentation. The only reason I watch it again and again is to enjoy the Morricone tracks and view an entertaining film. MGM has released a PAL-Region 2 DVD, which was well-received. It has the original letterbox (2.35:1) and infinitely better video quality. Check amazon.uk as I will, and once I get it, I'll burn my copy.",1157587200,6,3770,4.579259259259259

542435,4,6303052487,"I'm not the world's biggest connoisseur of spaghetti westerns, but I'm really surprised that I'd never heard of this film before I found it in the local bargain bin.  The title, DEATH RIDES A HORSE, automatically catapults it somewhere near the top of best-named westerns (the original Italian title is DA UOMO A UOMO, which Altavista's Babelfish translates as the singularly uninteresting ""From Man To Man"").

The film stars Lee Van Cleef (""the bad"" in THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY) and John Phillip Law (known to Mystery Science Theater 3000 fans for his roles of Kalgan in SPACE MUTINY and of Diabolik in the film of the same name).  As a child, Law's character witnesses a gang shooting his father, and raping and killing his mother and sister.  During the attack, the child notices a distinct feature on each member of the gang.

Flash forward fifteen years, and Law is an angry young man who has trained himself to be the finest marksman in the West.  But his inexperience is his weakness as he begins a journey of revenge against the evil men who took his family from him.  (Luckily for him, his targets haven't thought to remove the distinguishing pieces of jewelry and clothing in the intervening decade and a half.)

Cleef has just finished serving a fifteen year term of hard labor and he has his own score to settle with the same gang who killed Law's family.  The two protagonists -- while potential allies -- find themselves at odds when their methods of revenge don't exactly turn out to be compatible.  Their conflict is what drives the film, as well as providing some of the (very) few laughs.

The acting is what one can usually expect from Spaghetti Westerns - everything from professional actors right on down to people one assumes were random folks who showed up at the film location with their own rags.  Lee Van Cleef, I had only before seen in the two ""Man With No Name"" movies, but he's as collected, smooth, tough and just plain cool here as he was in those.  John Phillip Law is fairly wooden (no surprise there), but his style fits the character he's playing.

Behind the scenes, there are a fistful of connections to the well-known Clint Eastwood and Sergio Leone trilogy.  Writer Luciano Vincenzoni had co-written FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE and THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY.  Composer Ennio Morricone, who composed for THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY, contributes the score.  For my money it's just as good as what he wrote for that better known film. (As an aside, I've read on the Internet Movie Database that Quentin Tarantino used part of this music in his KILL BILL.)

In the past I've poked fun at the hilarious typographical errors present on the Digiview Productions DVD boxes.  I've tried to refrain of late, partially because my own typing skills are nothing to write home about, but mostly because it's like shooting fish in a barrel.  But I must make note of the phrase written across the bottom of the front cover.  The tag line states, ""The Lenghts (sic) One Man Will Go to Take His Rewenge (sic)"".  Rewenge?  Who's their copy-editor - Peter Cook's character in THE PRINCESS BRIDE? (""Rewenge!  Rewenge is what bwings us togewah today!"")

The sound quality is abysmal.  Since the movie was dubbed into English, I'm assuming that the original soundtrack wasn't very clear either, but the version on this DVD seems particularly poor.  It's extremely muffled, making the dialog difficult to discern.  At times you'll wonder whether the sound is coming out of the TV in front of you, or your next-door neighbor's speakers.

The picture quality is acceptable, although not what anyone could realistically describe as good.  The worst problem is that the film is presented in full-screen and it was obviously shot with wide-screen in mind.  There are a number of scenes where it's obvious that the audience is missing something because of the inferior aspect ratio.

DEATH has everything that a good western needs.  It's got action, revenge, and treachery.  The script is peppered with delightfully tough and macho one-liners.  It's as stylish as any spaghetti western I've ever seen.  The plot moves very quickly and in sometimes surprising directions (although if you don't spot the final twist before it happens, then you were clearly not paying attention).  If you're a newbie who wants to try a spaghetti western, then this is a perfect one to start with.  And, thanks to its budget DVD release, you can get it for about a buck or so.  Though, I should point out that this is a detriment, really, since it means that no studio will bother putting out a cleaned-up (and wide-screen!) version.  Which is what this film richly deserves.",1126310400,10,4674,4.750620347394541
542436,4,6303052487,"O.k, if you love spaggethi westerns your gonna love this movie. Sure it's a little formulaic, but hell it's a spag western what do you expect.

Now the bad part. The transfer is beyond terrible. This film was originally shot on a very wide scope (like most spag westerns) and has a stack of tight focus shots. All of the above works against this full screen pan and scan version. Basically it's like trying to watch the movie through a pin hole.

542439,3,6303052487,"Spaghetti westerns are, in my opinion, generally the best fictional films about the American West. You can argue that John Wayne made a bunch of great movies about life in the Old West, and you would be right to say so, but for some reason the Italians perfectly captured specific elements of the era that made their movies seem more realistic. The frontier was a dirty, violent place full of unsavory types trying to get rich quick. Italian westerns capture this mood expertly whereas American films portray characters whose outfits look like they just came back from the dry cleaners. Hollywood films also tend to apply a black and white dichotomy on the characters, the old ""good guys wear white, bad guys wear black"" philosophy that obscures the reality of the time and place. Not so in Italian films, where even the good guys often have decidedly unsavory traits. It's too bad spaghetti westerns went the way of the dinosaurs a few decades back; I never tire of watching these films even though I am not an expert on the genre. ""Death Rides a Horse"" was one of my first excursions outside the standard Sergio Leone canon. After watching the film, I can unequivocally state that this film deserves an elevated place in the genre. It's that good.
""Da uomo a uomo,"" the film's Italian title, introduces the viewer to two powerful characters. Bill (John Phillip Law) is a young man with a phenomenal command of firearms seeking vengeance. When he was a child, he watched as a gang of ruffians slaughtered his entire family. Even though he couldn't see the men's faces due to masks, he burned into his memory specific identifying features of each of these killers. Later, as a grown man, he rides the countryside looking for a tattoo or a scar that will tell him he has found his man. And woe to the outlaws responsible for the murder of Bill's family if this gunslinger ever finds them. Playing opposite Bill is Ryan (Lee Van Cleef), a recently released convict who just finished a fifteen-year stretch for robbery. Ryan's overriding goal in life is to find his former partners, a gang of miscreants who cheated him out of his take in the robbery and left him behind to take the fall. The former outlaw isn't seeking violent retaliation for what his compatriots did to him; he just wants his money and plans on moving along.
Predictably, Bill and Ryan soon meet up. They don't like each other at the start although they soon build up a grudging respect for each other's determination and talents. Clandestine admiration doesn't stop Ryan from trying to leave Bill behind so he can resume his search for his former partners, but it also doesn't stop the two from continually meeting up. Ryan heads to a town where it is rumored one of his former partners runs several lucrative businesses. Not surprisingly, this guy isn't happy to see Ryan up close and personal. He gives Van Cleef's character a song and dance about not having the money and then tries to double cross him. Oops, one bad guy down for the count. The next stop on the pay-off highway sees pretty much the same result. A few of these one-time outlaws are going legit and the last thing they want is a reminder of their shady past. That doesn't mean they have changed their violent ways, though. When Ryan's surviving partners decide to put a stop to this loose cannon for the last time, the action moves down into Mexico where Bill and Ryan duke it out with the bad guys. A twist ending, one that shouldn't be that great of a surprise, pits the two uneasy partners against one another.
""Death Rides a Horse"" is an atmospheric, character driven spaghetti western sure to entertain fans of the genre. Lee Van Cleef is excellent, of course, as the wronged Ryan. With a short glance, a movement of the body, and a brief word, Van Cleef can and does convey a whole range of emotions. The same cannot be said for John Phillip Law, who as a central character in the unfolding drama emotes with all the range of a rock. The bad guys are great, seedy looking villains without an ounce of sympathy for anyone who gets in their way. Check out those ultra scary looking banditos they hire to gun for Ryan and Bill. It looks like I'm slipping into that dichotomy I blasted Hollywood for, namely the good guy/bad guy separation. Van Cleef's character, however, is only good in the sense that he's trying to get what he is due. He could care less about righting wrongs or bringing these guys to justice. He just wants his cash so he can take off. If that means stomping on toes that just happen to be bad, so be it. Ryan would just as likely step on good people.
This DVD, from a company called Direct Source, is a huge disappointment. Sure, you get a few crummy extras (a trivia quiz and a few lean cast bios), but the picture quality is so bad, so atrocious, that it looks like the cousin thrice removed of a seventh generation VHS duplicate. Moreover, the picture is a badly cropped fullscreen transfer. ""Death Rides a Horse"" desperately needs a decent disc release because this film is one powerful spaghetti western effort. Watching Lee Van Cleef duke it out with the baddies is an event always worth celebrating. Here's to hoping we'll see a better DVD version in the future.",1086393600,42,5231,4.601713062098501
542440,3,6303052487,"I have always liked this obscure Italian western.  Lee Van Cleef is outstanding and off sets to some extent, the dull monotone performance of John Phillp Law.  Leone stalwarts Luigi Pistilli and Mario Brega also are in the film. The DVD quality is atrocious, the picture is horrible and is in miserable pan and scan to boot.  Hopefully one day this film will be restored and given proper DVD treatment.  Widescreen folks! Pan and scan just does not make it.  That was the big mistake VHS made.  If this had nice picture quality and was in widescreen, I would give it 4 stars easily.",1085961600,2,582,4.548076923076923

542443,3,6303052487,"For fans of the spaghetti western genre, Death Rides a Horse will remind them of For A Few Dollars More, one of Sergio Leone's Dollars trilogy starring Clint Eastwood.  While very similar the film is still worth watching.  Lee Van Cleef is awesome, as usual, with John Phillip Law giving a decent performance albeit without much emotion.  Usual cast of supporters in the genre with Luigi Pistilli and Mario Brega and even a small part with Anthony Dawson.  Excellent storyline with one of the best endings in the spaghetti genre.  However the DVD is of very poor quality with no extras offered whatsoever.  Do what I did and wait for Turner Classic Movies to air it in widescreen and tape it. Only reason I give this DVD 3 stars is because of the quality.  The movie on its own would probably be closer to five.",1043020800,7,811,4.551724137931035

7835515,3,6303052487,"Death Rides a Horse is a revenge spaghetti Western. As a child, young Bill hides in his ranch house and witnesses the rape and killing of his mother, as well as the murder of his father and older sister by a vicious gang of Mexicans. Emblazoned in his memory are details of each gang member  a pierced ear, a tattooed chest, a scarred forehead. When the house is set on fire, Bill is rescued by an unseen stranger. Now, 15 years later, Bill (John Phillip Law) has become a fast gun with a thirst for vengeance.

Ryan (Lee Van Cleef) has just been released from prison for a crime he was framed for. Like Bill, Ryan is obsessed with seeking justice for his years behind bars.

Director Giulio Petroni tells these parallel tales of vengeance with full spaghetti-Western treatment, including lots of violence, anti-hero short on words, long on action, and a score by Ennio Morricone. The pace is slow, building suspense by switching back and forth between events in the past and the present. Van Cleef, who had appeared for years as a bad guy in Hollywood films, is given a chance to show some real acting ability, though its hard not to wonder how Clint Eastwood would have played the role. Luigi Pistilli is excellent as a bandit leader turned politician. Director Petroni draws on the zoom lens a bit too much to make a dramatic point, but its repeated use wears thin and becomes tiresome, drawing more attention to cinematic technique than to story development.

The opening scene is brutal and unrelenting, setting the tone for what is to follow. Later scenes don't quite come up to that level of horror, but nonetheless depict torture, agonizing killings, and sadism.

Bonus materials on the Blu-ray release include audio commentary, and original theatrical trailer.",1510272000,,1769,4.786885245901639
