1691582,5,B000063TOO,"this movie is the type of movie that u would watch with friends and laugh because its so lame. Surprisingly the plot is very good, but how it is executed, the actors and actresses, and the acting are terrible. I rated it a 5 becuase of how lame it is which makes the movie insanly funny.the scene that was bad was the part where they showed the 80 year old grandma with no cloths on. EEEEKKKKK. hahahah its a funny move otherwise.",1074816000,,430,4.2560975609756095
1691583,2,B000063TOO,"When I first watched Dead and Rotting, I thought it was one of the worst movies I'd ever seen.  As I saw more of these horrible B Movies though(such as KillJoy 1 AND 2, Prison of the Dead, Killer Klowns from Outer Space, etc), I realized that strangely enough Dead and Rotting is one of the better ones.  Let me just repeat: this movie is really bad.  I would not suggest buying it unless you are in some way related to anyone who was involved with it and simply don't want to hurt their feelings.  It IS, however, perfectly good for renting if you plan to watch it with a group of people.  The reason for this is that it is just so bad that it is hilarious.  The basic plot focuses on what happens to three guys when they upset a local witch by trespassing and then later messing with her cat.  The dialog is unrealistic, and there are plot elements that just don't make ANY sense at all, but that is exactly why it is still a very enjoyable movie to watch with friends if you keep in mind that it is not being watched for its cinematic value.  The bottom line is that this is the kind of movie that is fun to make fun of.",1065830400,7,1123,4.095890410958904
1691584,2,B000063TOO,"Yea, it was pretty bad, dumb, generic. Only good points, it was dark, had mild creepy aspects about it, and the pumpkin child scene was pretty nasty, I gave it an extra star for that, that was cooL! barely worth a rental, have seen worse though, also seen a million better",1058486400,2,272,4.352941176470588
1691585,2,B000063TOO,"Hated it. Don't need to say much more.  If you like ultra-low budget movies with bad acting, then you might like it.  To me it had no redeeming values.",1057017600,2,151,4.172413793103448
1691586,4,B000063TOO,"It is a dark and stormy night. Or in this case, a dark and tranquil night. The air is still and quiet, so quiet in fact, even the trees rustling in the soft evening breeze can be heard. Suddenly, the silence is disrupted by a soft, gentle humming which invade your ears, beckoning you. The humming quickly comes to a stop. A bizarre nursery rhyme faintly fills the air. ""Do you know what it's like when you're dead and rotting? Your flesh turns putrid and your clothes start spotting. Your belly bloats up, your guts turn to chum. Your eyeballs turn purple, like over-ripe plums.""

Those are the chilling words uttered by 100-year old witch Abigail in make-up and special effects guru David P. Barton's directorial debut, DEAD AND ROTTING. Barton describes the film as ""a movie about unintended consequences and escalating vengeance framed as a modern day fairy tale,"" with Debbie Rochon rounding off the terrific cast.

The story goes like this: Three prank playing buddies accidentally get themselves caught up in a life or death struggle with a powerful backwoods witch(the aforementioned Abigail) after accidentally killing her son Pox. Along the way, several characters get caught by the witch and are fed her regurgitation, which causes them to rot while still alive. Definitely not BLAIR WITCH, but if you were to categorize it, I would say it is along the lines of PUMPKINHEAD. The combination of Barton's enthusiasm coupled with the special effects work of Ron Karkoska make DEAD AND ROTTING an unusual and exciting experience roughly akin to being one of the first to discover the early works of Wes Craven and Tobe Hooper.

Dead and Rotting is a clever, well-crafted tale, brimming with suspense and atmosphere. It's low budget is evident but the tale is so fascinating and intense, all that can be looked past.",1055721600,,1822,4.889967637540453
1691587,2,B000063TOO,"Full Moon has really lost it's touch as of late.  First Retro Puppet Master (ugh), followed by Subspeices 4 (double ugh).  Than a whole series of other pieces of garbage (Hell Asylem, Prison of the Dead, Cryptz) and this is no better.
The story invloves a group of men who love to drink,love practical jokes,  and love women.  One night they drive up to a witches house in order to pull the prank on a friend.  The bet is that if they can make him wet himself than he owes them 12 beers.  The prank goes off well mostly due to the fact that the witches son show up to drive them off.  Later when at the bar the son shows up for a bowl of milk (?) and when he grabs a waitress they drive him off and beat him up.  They later hire two stoners to throw rocks through the window off her house.  They screw up and boil her cat which by a strange circumstance happens to be her son.  She grieves for a few minutes than makes a concoction in a bathtub, gets naked (and yes you see most of her, my eyes) and comes out stunning woman (who is just as naked).  Her first act is that she ""gets it on"" with all three in the same hosue at the same time (or consecutivly).  She than goes home and what can only be assumed as ""releasing her bowls"" mixes that with a pumpkin to create three zombies.  Oh and she goes after the stoners as well.  Beyond that it's just a matter of survival of the hokiest.
Basically this is just typical low budget blaw.  The movie itself was filmed in current full moon style with barley any style or class.  This is just another step down from a once respectable direct to video organization.  It's a shame that they can only produce garbage like this and it's hard to believe that they made such classics as Trancers, Puppet Master, Pit and the Pendelum, and Dollman.  Now they are just as bad as Troma (Class of Nukem HIgh 3  <1 star>) or the new guy Brain Damage (Terror Toons <1 star>).  Unless your a fan of garbage horror, than avoid.",1034467200,5,1956,4.165333333333334
1691588,3,B000063TOO,"hmm another full moon pictures film.  well it's definitely better than hell asylum.  definitely worth 3 stars though, pretty entertaining film with good special f/x.  zombies were very nicely done and a pretty good storyline.  nothing great but a real good film for full moon.  definitely worth checking out, has some pretty funny moments in it also.",1027814400,4,350,5.0701754385964914
1691589,4,B000063TOO,"Dead & Rotting is a groovy film and well worth a look. The story involves a group of friends who's clowning about upsets the local witch. It is said that she has a potion that keeps the victim concious while they decompose. And while the're fertilizer she makes the best of it, growing plants from them.
I won't spoil the story but can mention some of the scenes I thought were espicially heavy, like when the old witch pours a potion into the bath tub and gets in, then comes out a young and stunningly beautiful lady ( in the form of the fabulous Debbie Rochon! ). Also the whole concept and depiction of the witch creating the ghouls is very unique and creative.
My only complaint is that the film didn't have enough gore, especially when you consider the title, but still it is overall an excellent horror flick. The story has a lot of creativity and is well acted.
Personally my favourite actress in the whole world is Debbie Rochon, so I watch and buy a lot of her movies. Her performance is awesome as it is in all her films. Trent Haaga from Terror Firmer also stars and that guy defintily has his own kind of screen presence.
I bought the limited special edition of this film on DVD and found it tight as a drum with special features, including an entire low budget comedy featurette thrown in as an extra, in which Miss Rochon plays a nerd in a twisted cinderella type story. It is very funny especially when Debbie is acting out the geek persona.
I think this DVD is a really decent package, very cool horror flick, hilarious bonus featurette, lots of great extra's, so if this is the type of film that would interest you RUN OUT AND GET A COPY, IT'S LIMITED EDITION!!!",1019779200,13,1680,4.405144694533762

Well I got it in the mail on Wednesday started to watch it & had to turn it off after watching it. This movie isn't my cup of tea I'll try to watch it again but still feel the same way.

And some magical counter attacks. There are some very interesting creatures in the film. And there is some very interesting humor in the film here and there.

7959643,3,B000063TOO,"This is one of the better Tempe videos. Three young men get into a tussle with a witch and her son. Things escalate to a point to where ghouls are involved. The surviving man gets help from a stripper named Rose, who is also a part time witch.

The acting, plot, dialouge and sound track are far better than most of the Tempe videos out there. If you can't stomach this low budget attempt, don't bother with other Tempe films.

This is a blast with a very original story and a cool cast of bone headed guys.

My only real complaint is the minimal amount of T.& A.

If you like B movies like I do this is the top of the pile and you can buy it used for less then you can rent it.",1150329600,3,484,3.6346153846153846
7959646,1,B000063TOO,"Full Moon used to produce some top quality films from great director's such as Stewart Gordon and the like. Unfortunatly from about Puppet Master 4 onward, things have been looking VERY grim.  The quality in there films have taken a drastic turn, apparently due to lack of funds...

...or cut backs in order to increase profits, who knows. What evert he reason, they can't seem to find a decent actors, directors, FX crews, Costume Managers, etc. For ANY of there films. I swear you can buy half there props and costumes at about any arts and craft store.

This movie sux, and not in a good way like Bad Taste, it's not so dumb and crappy it is funny, NOTHING!!!

Well except for the naked old lady, that in itself is worth the rental, infact if they would cut out the rest of the film save for that one scene, I'd say it would be worth buying.",1097452800,3,844,4.356687898089172
