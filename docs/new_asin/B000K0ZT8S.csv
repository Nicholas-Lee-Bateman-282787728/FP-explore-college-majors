It's graphic images are testimony to the Linda McCartney quote: ""If slaughterhouses had glass walls, we'd all be vegetarians,"" and invite each of us to reexamine how we view the other living, feeling beings with whom we share this planet. Don't miss it.",1175731200,16,392,4.9393939393939394

2681096,5,B000K0ZT8S,"Meet Your Meat is not fun to watch, but it is something anybody who supports the meat industry should see. Its big advantage over other powerful documentaries is that it is only about ten mintues long. How can somebody who says they care about your heart, refuse you ten minutes? Buy this video and ask your family and friends, as a present to you, to watch it. It may change their lives, and the lives of countless animals.",1199059200,6,424,4.448717948717949
2681097,5,B000K0ZT8S,"Forget what the meat, dairy and egg industries tell you about how they treat animals.  See for yourself!",1198972800,5,104,4.777777777777778
2681098,5,B000K0ZT8S,"Meet Your Meat is a powerful yet brief introduction into the treatment of animals raised for food; it is, for all practical purposes, one of a kind.  It won't make for pleasant viewing, but it is information very worthy of our consideration and is presented in an accessible, succinct manner.  For those concerned about animals or in making the world a kinder place with less suffering in it, this is a must see.",1198972800,4,412,4.63013698630137
2681099,5,B000K0ZT8S,"Meat Your Meat is a powerful investigation into the routinely cruel treatment of animals in the egg, dairy, and meat industries. Anyone who cares about animals -- and what they're eating -- would be well-advised to watch it.",1198972800,8,224,4.921052631578948
2681100,5,B000K0ZT8S,"A incredibly eye opening video. No wonder the slaughterhouses are kept from public view, why they call dead animals ""pork"" and ""meat."" It sounds so much less related to reality. It is sad to see how animals are born and raised,just to meet the fate of a horrible death. And there are so many, so many.

The movie is compelling and very worthwhile. If you want to see reality in food production, if you want to know, and not shelter yourself, from what went into making your ""burger,"" see this movie.

To see what goes on behind the scenes is enough to make me give up meat for ever. I think anyone who calls himself or herself compassionate will do the same.

2681101,5,B000K0ZT8S,"An excellent piece that raises consciousness about how that piece of ""meat"" got on your dinner plate.  10 BILLION animals---10,000 every 30 minutes--are slaughtered so that hmumans may have their mouthful of flesh.  This film reveals the incredible amount of animal suffering that goes into that mouthful and the ethical dilemas that confront the human species for participating in it.",1198972800,6,385,5.4
2681102,5,B000K0ZT8S,"After watching this deeply moving video there's no way you'll ever want to go back to eating meat. Every day, millions of animals are brutally killed for food in the United States. Their lives are cut short as they are crammed into factory farms, forced to live in their own filth, never to feel the sun of their back or grass beneath their feet. As they are drugged to grow so fast in such a short period of time, many animals will die before they even reach the slaughterhouse, the victims of their own misfortune.

Alec Baldwin narrates this piece and shows such cruelties of our world today. After coming face to face with such horrors, you'll want to know more about the true tragedies of factory farming. So, the next time you sit down to eat dinner, take a good look at what's on your plate. Is it comforting to know your dinner may have once had a face?",1179705600,10,861,4.38125
2681103,5,B000K0ZT8S,I am so glad I watched this video -- a real eye opener for those of us who have never seen how animals are treated before they end up on our fork. Highly recommend.,1175731200,14,164,3.8529411764705883

Eating meat account for over 90% of modern diseases.  The violence involved in killing advanced life forms like sheeps and cows has no place in an evolved society.",1397692800,,302,4.788461538461538
8153743,5,B000K0ZT8S,"A terrible, yet well done documentary that anyone should watch, especially non-vegans.  I watch to continually remind myself of the reasons I became vegan.",1397433600,,155,5.458333333333333
8153744,3,B000K0ZT8S,"As as comments about content, I mostly agree with the 5-star reviews posted (20, at the time of this writing).  My disappointments are of a more technical nature.

(1)  It's only 13 minutes long. This is clearly stated up front, but, unlike other reviewers, I didn't find that satisfactory for reasons explained below.  I found myself searching for more when it was clear everything to be shown had been shown. There was no menu from which to select; you hit your Play button, period.

(2)  The video case touted ""Updated"" and Amazon's site claims ""Bonus features include videos starring Pamela Anderson."" I'm no fan of Anderson's, but I wanted to see the extra features. My order came with a single video as described above. I so need to believe proceeds of this relatively high-priced 13-minute video go to PETA; otherwise, I feel cheated. Not blaming Amazon, but something went wrong somewhere. Vendor error maybe?

I think ""Earthlings,"" narrated by Joaquin Phoenix, is a more compelling, engaging, informative, comprehensive video.  If I had to choose only one of the two, that's the one I'd recommend.

Unfortunately, I'd had the video a long time before watching,  so it didn't occur to me to return it, or at least check with the vendor about missing features. Had I received the wrong video?  Or was this false advertising?  I'd suggest to anyone who does order that they be prepared to address these potential issues.  Another possibility:  You might first check to see if it can be streamed to your TV or computer either free or at a reduced price.",1387843200,,1558,4.830188679245283
8153745,5,B000K0ZT8S,"Meet you meat is hard to watch.  It is disgusting, sickening, and unfortunately true.  These clips are not the worst examples seen in rarity at factory farms.  Sadly, these examples happen every day, all day.

I would recommend this only if you want the TRUTH.  Though, its probaly not good for children.  I disagree with PETA on many issues but kudos for putting this video out.",1301788800,,379,4.666666666666667

8153747,5,B000K0ZT8S,"Where does meat come from?  Not from the classic, Old MacDonald farm popular in images on packages of bacon and butter. The modern factory farm is a place of horror for sentient creatures. This video is brief enough to fit into a coffee break, but packs a lot of information into each segment. Very well done.",1277596800,,309,4.517857142857143
8153748,5,B000K0ZT8S,"SIMPLY, I TOTALLY AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THE 5 STAR REVIEWERS GAVE FOR THIS DVD.  IT IS VERY HARD TO WATCH, BUT A MUST SEE FOR EVERYONE!  Don't pass it up.  Buy it, and see exactly what is happening to the animals that we need to speak up for.",1274572800,,242,4.0
8153749,1,B000K0ZT8S,"The Drug Companies are very much interested in stopping all animal research.  It is during this research that we discover some of the unsuspected side effects of the chemicals that they are developing for treatment of various human conditions.  It is one thing to try and prevent unnecessary harm to our fellow species, which we all can agree on.  It is another to try and turn such a worthy cause into an excuse to stop drug research on animals.
Think about where the big money comes to support PETA and other radical groups that help these big companies...",1272844800,,558,4.673469387755102
