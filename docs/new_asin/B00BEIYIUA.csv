5597951,3,B00BEIYIUA,"""What if love was stronger then gravity."" Adam (Sturgess) and Eden (Dunst) have been friends since they were kids. They only thing that keeps them apart is gravity. The world they live in has two separate gravities and they live in two separate ""worlds"". After an accident leaves Adam thinking Eden is gone he moves on with his life. After seeing Eden on TV one day he decides to risk everything by finding her again. This is a movie that is very hard to explain without giving anything away. I have said that I'm tired of the same 5 movies being remade over and over again with nothing original coming out. This is one of the most original and visually stunning movies that I have ever seen. The only downside I have with this movie is that they seemed to spend more time on the effects then the actually story. While the story is really good it does seem to drag and repeat itself a few times but overall I would recommend this. Overall, worth seeing and one of the most visually stunning movies I have ever seen, very neat effects. I give it a B.",1369440000,18,1049,4.357142857142857
5597952,4,B00BEIYIUA,"This story is a unique one in deed. Two worlds on the same axis with different gravities as well as cultural and resource differences. Two people in love breaking these boundaries to be together.
Storyline is good. Visual is outstanding.  Makes one see and realize just how difficult it would be to live in a demension such as the one in the movie.
You'll have to watch this sifi love story to at least be very impressed.
This was produced in 2011. Very surprised that marketing was not as impressive.",1369094400,,501,4.566666666666666
5597953,5,B00BEIYIUA,My son and I saw this at a sneak preview.  It only showed at a more independent theatre.  Too bad!  Never even saw it advertised.  Both my 11 year old son and I loved this movie.  Good story with the most Increadable eye candy.  Was looking to see if it was released to own yet.  Looks like we'll have to wait.  Can't wait to watch it again.,1367971200,4,341,3.985074626865672
5597954,5,B00BEIYIUA,"Most viewers will regret they could not see this at the movie theaters due to a lousy distribution deal. Not a perfect movie, but definitely a one of a kind visual experience.

5597957,4,B00BEIYIUA,"Imagine my surprise when this movie showed up this weekend out of nowhere, without any advance advertizing, on a single screen for all of Greater Cincinnati. I figured this wasn't going to play very long here so I went to see it right away.

""Upside Down"" has a very intruiging premise: there are two worlds very close together but each with their own gravity. As the movie opens, we are informed of the basic three rules: 1. All matter is pulled by the gravity of the world that it comes from, and not the other. 2. An object's weight can be offset by matter from the opposite world (inverse matter). 3. After some time in contact, matter in contact with inverse matter burns. Wow, get your head around that! As the movie opens, we see young/eventual teenagers Adam (played by Jim Sturgess) and Eden (played by Kirsten Dunst) find each other in striking distance from opposing sides of a high mountain. Adam pulls in Eden with a rope, and as Eden is hanging/resting upside down in a rock, they kiss (hello, Spiderman upside-down kiss replay, anyone?). Eventually they are found out and as Eden is trying to get back to her ""Up"" world, the rope is shot and she takes a bad tumble, causing amnesia. Fast forward 10 years, and by complete chance Adam (from the ""Down"" world) see that Eden is now working at TransWorld, the 'evil' company that controls everything. Adam is developing an ""anti-gravity"" matter that also serves as an ""anti-aging"" creme. That appeals to TransWorld and he gets hired. Adam is bent on finding Eden and reconnecting with her, even though she has no memory of him and her teenage romance with him. At this point we are not even half-way into the movie, but to tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several commments: first and foremost, this movie is the most visual original movie that I have seen in a long, long time. It is slightly reminiscent of ""Inception"" in its visuals, but then does it one or two times better than that, just outstanding. I just couldn't stop marveling at how the images of the two ""upside down"" worlds were presented to us. That said, I thought that Sturgess was badly miscast as Adam. Even though he is in reality older than Dunst, he just looked like a boy next to her. On the other hand, Dunst just shines in this movie, continuing her strong streak in recent movies like Melancholia and Bachelorette. Kudos also for the nice soundtrack, scored by Mark Isham, a favorite of mine. The screening that I saw this at today here in Cincinnati was poorly attended (only 2 people besides myself), so if you get a chance to see this in the theatre, do not wait, or otherwise catch it on DVD. The plot lacks some emotional pull but the visuals will win you over.",1363910400,108,2780,4.558
5597958,5,B00BEIYIUA,"Just wanted to say that if you are a sci-fi fan and enjoy outstanding visuals, like me, you must see this.
They probably got the visuals concept from ""Inception"" but actually used them in the plot instead of just for show (not that I didn't like Inception - I did).
For me - and I guess I can say I've probably seen it all - this is the most artistic outstandng visual movie I've seen in, say, the last 2 years or so.
It has got an interesting uplifting love story with a rather uncommon arc that might keep you guessing until the very end.
Get ready for something... different.",1363564800,64,578,4.263636363636364
5597959,4,B00BEIYIUA,"Eschewing the physics of reality, this film weaves a wonderfully fascinating tale of two young people in love. An astrophysics tale of Romeo and Juliet as the star-crossed lovers separated by a complex Escher-esque world of haves and have-nots.

Jim Sturgess and Kirsten Dunst portray Adam and Eden respectively.

Adam lives in the frigid, dirty, and dank oily world of Downbelow. While Eden's home is Uptop, a dreamlike existence of warm bright air and glittering palaces of light. Two planets who share every basic elemental aspect, but are divided by an unspoken social and fiscal chasm. But there are special places, natural features of great height, where the two worlds almost touch one another. A place like the Sage Mountains.

A chance encounter between a thoughtful young boy and a young girl searching for her lost dog, accidentally bumping into one another at their respective peaks, begins a desperate dance as two halves of the same soul find, then lose one another.

Like all children, they're born without hate in their hearts. Eden and Adam become friends. And as the years pass, become more than friends. Despite the monstrous illegality of their relationship, love blossoms in secret. Until one fateful day as the teen couple encounters a group of angry Downbelowers who attack the pair for their illicit romance. While helping Eden make her escape, Adam is shot. Losing his grip while attempting to lower her ""up"", the freefall drop ends with a sickening crunch. Striking solid stone as she crashes back onto her world, a widening pool of blood is the last image he has of her.

Ten years pass.

Now working as an electronics repairman with asides as an inventor, Adam unknowingly stands at the brink of a discovery that will revolutionize both worlds. Believing that his soulmate died on that fateful day, he goes through the motions of an infinitely empty existence. Until a pirated television program from Uptop catches his eye. It's her - she's alive. And he will do anything to again be with his one true love. Anything. Even prostitute his incredible creation to the corporate slave masters of Uptop's largest corporation, Transworld, for that single solitary chance.

Finagling his way into and through Transworld - he's stunned and horrified to discover Eden doesn't know him.

Nearly beyond words, he learns that the fall all those years ago caused blunt force amnesia; she has no memory of her childhood and teen years except when she sleeps and dreams.

Undaunted, Adam undertakes the ultimate risk.

The twin worlds' equivalent of a terrorist attack is to cross over without permission. A strictly forbidden act, permission is never ever granted. But he's going to cross over - repeatedly. His only hope is to encourage her memories to return by consistent re-association. But a Downbelower noticeably, and literally, stands out (up) from the crowd. As Uptop's gravity slowly burns through his illicit Up-gravity weights, Adam has to manage and mask his increasingly uncomfortable state while his custom bodysuit tips at the verge of combustion. And in a world full of Up citizenry, desperately has to avoid drawing public scrutiny to the fact that he's threatening immolation with every passing moment.

Authorities from both sides are in hot pursuit, no pun intended, and closing in on the repetitious violator.

A very entertaining romance for a 21st century audience. And, uncommonly, a good fit for both men and women, as this film captures the emotional aspects of a chick flick while carefully balancing the taut scifi and adventure aspects of a guy movie.

There were a couple of very small weaknesses that prevents a full five stars, but this incredible visual feast is as strong a four as I can imagine.

Movie Note:

- Despite the fact the two planets share an equal orbit, I thought it cleverly profound that Director Juan Solanas never shows Downbelow as ""up"" when viewing the two worlds in the context of right and wrong, or even good and evil.",1360886400,71,3990,4.978947368421053

5598122,5,B00BEIYIUA,"It is a shame that Upside Down had such a painful and unpromising commercial launch. However, its painful birth has nothing to do with the merits of the finished work of art. As a finished movie, it is a beautiful work of art. The movie brought me in to an expansive, magical world. The rich music, the tango, the soaring spaces and height reeled me in. The ""Dos Mundos"" (two worlds) concept was a powerful metaphor for the gulf between two lovers and between two social classes.

On a political level the movie was a rebuke of any coercive aristocracy where a supposedly superior upper class uses police power to oppress those ""below."" In the end, that divide was rebuked by the individualism of the movie. Adam was obviously as smart as and as worthy as anyone from the upper world. And Adam and Eden deserved every right to love each other.

The movie was sumptuous, soaring, a magical romantic sci-fi fantasy. I loved it.

Incidentally, I am just a fan. I have no connection with the movie. I was looking to see what subsequent movies the writer/director, Juan Solanas, has done. I am very saddened that I could find none. I hope he is actively working on something new and great, and that the commercial failure of this movie has not deterred him. Mr. Solanas is a great director/writer. The vision in this movie is unique and beautiful.

Boy on mountaintop in Down Below (the down-at-heels planet) looks up to see girl on mountaintop of the wealthy planet. Love at first sight. Tragically separated for ten years. But boy, now man, spots her on TV and goes hunting for her. This is where the story gets lost in a welter of plot details that are hard to follow and make little sense. Plot holes big enough to drive Peterbilts through. And when it ends on a treacly, trite plot point that was totally unneeded, I go: ""Man, did you really have to do that?""

It's so badly done it's almost worth owning, but maybe not at Amazon's price (a friend gifted me after finding it in the $1 bin at a local store).  First a warning: The ""3D"" may give you a terrific headache. Watching it, my eyes kept involuntarily shifting focus, trying to make sense of the 3D imagery. Examples: At times, Kirsten Dunst's hair floats 18 inches behind her face, rock outcroppings in the visual background are positioned in foreground planes. A few of the upside-down scenes are charming -- imagine M.C. Escher scenes come to life -- but most are simply bewildering, especially in 3D. There's a scene where Jim Sturgess' short leap onto the top of a descending gondola car reads visually as if he jumped the breadth of the Snake River.

5598326,4,B00BEIYIUA,"I found this 2012 Canadian-French SF romance quite watchable and I am glad that I saw it. However, with some minimum effort to improve the scenario it could have been a much better film. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Like in fairy tales, this is the story of two very different ""kingdoms"" (worlds). They are very close one to another, but gravity works in them in opposite directions. The story is told mostly from the perspective of Adam (Jom Sturges), who is poor and lives in the world of Down Below. When he was a child, he once climbed to the highest mountain and saw up there Eden (Kirsten Dunst), a rich girl from the world Up There, who also climbed to the top of the mountains in her world. The film tells the story of their gravity crossed romance...

The original idea is very good and visually this film is quite impressive. The romance is a nice and pleasant thing. Eden is a particularly likeable character. Kirsten Dunt played her in low key, as a ""girl next door"", rather down to earth (even if from the point of view of her beau she mostly is up there with clouds and heavenly angels - but after all men in love always think that of girls of their dreams) but also very warm, almost maternal. That is only fitting as - !! SPOILER HERE !! - her apparent destiny seems to be the mother of the (better) Future.

The scenario on another hand is not really terrific, quite predictable and cliched, full of enormous holes and with a completely ""deux ex machina"" ending. Still, the film is quite watchable.

The main hero works in a company managed by the privileged people from the Up There world - which allows the viewer to satisfy the fantasy of seeing all the bosses hanging from the ceiling...))) On another hand this uncomfortable positioning may explain, why this company is so poorly managed and especially has the worst security system (and security staff) EVER!

The film also quite usefully showsm that the solution for most of development and poverty problems, created in large part by the protectionism and state intervetions, is a mixture of free trade, free enterprise, free circulation of capitals, technological advances, scientific progress and taking chances by investing in start ups. A very wise vision of the reality.

Bottom line, this is a 3,5 stars effort, not expecialy good but quite watchable, entertainig and ultimately rather pleasant. I am glad that I watched it, but I am also glad that I rented it, instead of buying, as it is a thing to see once really. Also, it is mostly recommended for total SF buffs (guilty) and great fans of Kirsten Dunst (innocent here). ENJOY!",1454457600,,2643,4.660944206008583

5598510,3,B00BEIYIUA,"Sadly, I wasn't all that blown away with this movie. Don't get me wrong. The visuals and special effects were gorgeous and nothing short of breathtaking. But the overall story line was pretty weak. It has the effect of looking like some really groovy MT music video. When I first saw the previews of this movie I got the impression that Kirsten Dunst had a 50/50 role shared with Jim Sturgess. But as you watch the movie you soon learn that it's really pretty much about Jim's character as the protagonist and quite frankly, he's kinda flat and borders uninteresting. Kirsten's lines were weak and insignificant (actually the dialogue throughout from everyone's role was pretty much uninteresting). I think this movie could have really done a lot better if she were allowed to shine like she normally does. You Kirsten fans know what I'm talking about, right? I thought this role for her in this movie was be a bit stifling.

I left with the impression that the writers, director, producers and/or whoever else relied too heavily on beautiful cinematography and computer animation and not nearly enough on a thought provoking or, quite simply, compelling dialogue to complement the beautiful visuals.

I purchased this movie when it was on sale but quite honestly I don't think I will ever care to watch it again. I kinda wish I just rented it and not paid the money for it. I would like to give it two and a half stars because I found it to be less than ""okay"" but I don't dislike it, per se. I'm more disappointed and it's unfortunate as I thought, from the well executed previews, that I would love this film. It simply didn't deliver.",1430352000,5,1638,4.664359861591696

5598584,3,B00BEIYIUA,"Bottom Line first for those with little time: If you have a 3D TV then BUY THE 3D Blu-Ray now!

Otherwise I give it a 4/10.

First of all the movie has Kirsten Dunst. She caught my eye back in the movie The Virgin Suicides. She is just adorable in anything she does.  The setting is a rare phenomenon in the universe where a double planet exist where the worlds are so close to each other  you could literally build a tower whose base is on one planet and whose top is a base on the other planet  and they have done that in this movie. Its a love story.

I have yet to see the movie in 2D. I am a big 3D fan. The visuals may still be amazing in 2D. But in 3D it is stellar. Just stellar. You cant take your eyes off the movie. The movie/screenplay could have been written so much better. Things seem to be happening too quickly to make things less credible (regarding the people  not the sci fi aspect of the movie). The actors do their best with what they are given.

The blu-ray has a couple unremarkable deleted scenes, but this is a situation where they not only could have kept the deleted scenes IN the original movie, they needed to film ADDITIONAL scenes to add more credibility to the story.

I am trying to avoid giving out spoilers here. But towards the end of the movie Eden is embracing/talking to Adam and mentions something (well just say something relationship related), and I just started to shake my head. This is not something you just slip in whether in real life or just a movie (well you can - but it just doesnt work here in terms of credibility in this movie). But at the same time I didn't shut off the movie or feel disappointed.

For those who struggle to buy into the sci-fi aspect of the movie  this double planet scenario  do not judge the rest of the universe based on what is in our own solar system. From what I understand double star scenarios are just as much or more common than singe star systems, such as our own. And even though we are talking about double planets here  what I have heard and seen - keeps me way too open-minded to have any issues with this.

Enjoy the movie.",1420675200,2,2115,4.215880893300248

5598635,4,B00BEIYIUA,"I mean, why would we keep showing the Star-Crossed Lovers, again and again, in so many different ways, if it weren't a good one? Romeo and Juliet remains iconic, but only a token for all the different stories that play out the same way. And, if it matters, this one has a happy ending even if so many R&J knockoffs don't.

So, the love story works (amnesia, overcoming all obstacles, one more at the very end that would be a spoiler), but doesn't carry itself. Very competent actors help, not least Dunst looking wonderful. Nice, but they don't make it either. The real stars are the one you almost don't see, the effect-meisters doing the whole upside-down thing, and doing it with such utter fluency that you forget to howl ""That's just stupid"" at all the points that so desperately need it.

Visually riveting, passable story, and premise that almost holds together - a good evening's entertainment, if you don't think about it too much.

It mustve been a limited release. It kind of reminds me of Elysium. Two worlds, the one on top has it good, the one down below is cruddy. Two star crossed lovers from each side come together against all odds, like a futuristic Romeo and Juliet. The most interesting part of the movie is the rules of gravity. If you come from below you are pulled to that side and if you were born above you are pulled to that side. There is a company called Tri-corp  that both side go to work, so you see people walking right-side up and upside down or visa versa or what-ever. Its really weird and cool how they do it. Even objects from each side are pulled to the side of their origin. The visuals are pretty cool. At one point, Jim Sturgess has weights weighing him down to the top side and when he takes them off he flies up into the air and lands in the ocean on the other side. Its a really neat looking effect. Kirsten Dunst plays his true love from the other side, whom he meet as a child on a mountain top where they could see each other upside down from each other. Its hard to describe. You really need to see it just to see what I mean. Theres a scene in a restaurant where some of the couples are dancing on the floor and some are dancing on the ceiling. That would be so funky to live in a word like that. The love story between the two is beautiful and heart warming. Its such an honest innocent love. Jim Sturgess is just great.

I would say that including top directors of hollywood should look into these kind of new concepts than getting lost in the ""dark"" woods.

5598706,5,B00BEIYIUA,"Upside Down
Movies can move us, they inform us, they amuse us, they make us curious, they make us happy, they make us cry and sometimes, not often, they take us to such strange worlds we find, at the end, that not only can we not imagine such a place existing but also can't imagine a universe in which it doesn't  exist.

Those films are rare.  The ""Wizard of Oz"" is such a film and Oz is such a place.  So is the world of Peter Pan.  And Edward Scissorhands.  Terry Gilliam gave us ""Brazil.""  Robin Williams took us to the afterlife in ""What Dreams May Come."" We've had Hogwarts and Middle Earth and now there's ""Upside Down"" and the world of pink pollen, where rain falls up and imagination soars and little boys can stand on their tippy toes to kiss a little girl clinging to the underside of a cliff on another planet so close they are connected by a skyscraper known as the mega corporation Transworld.  And of course it's a romantic allegory and while we are certain we understand the simple technology used to create a mirror image when the sum is so much greater than the parts what we have is magic, not the magic that is illusion, but the illusion that is magical.  And we are transformed, as we watch, into something wiser, better somehow and we know we can never unsee what we've seen or be the same person we were the moment before the title played across the screen.

It's a tale of two worlds and it's as familiar to us as home.  It's a tale as old as time.  It's our story.  It's the story of Adam and Eden from different worlds and how they made it work.

I simply don't want to tell you anything more.  I've told you enough.  This is a gift wrapped in a wish and delivered by the magic that is streaming video.  And you too can learn about Aunt Becky's pink powder.  And the line, ""Mostly it just feels like something's missing.""  And we know if we just figure out what that something is, everything will be all right with the world, every world.

It was $10 on amazon (at the time I bought it). I figured, if it was horrible, I only spent $10 and I might be able to get some of that back. No need. This is a brilliant, amazing movie. The story is Romeo and Juliet at its core, with an amazing sci-fi twist. The CGI in this movie were terrific and the plot and script were great as well. The story made you feel sad and happy, excited and angry, all the great feelings you want to get from watching a movie. It was truly worth the money.

5598750,5,B00BEIYIUA,"""Upside-Down"" was apparently panned by critics and ignored by viewers, criticized for its abstract, physics-related concepts of physical gravity, looking for scientific exactness rather than just accepting that the setting is a small part of the film.
  To enjoy this, it's essential to forego analysis and view it as the story of young lovers who, due to the worlds in which they live, can never physically be together unless they can pull off a virtual miracle.  The message is clearly that love is a greater power than gravity, with a subtext that a single soul can split in the Great Void and become two separate people who unknowingly will devote their entire lives to being reunited.  You have to believe in at least some of this philosophy; it's well worth the effort.
  It's a dark film with a golden heart, visually beautiful and romantically believable.  Jim Burgess (a terrific young British actor here using an American accent) lives on the impoverished world below, looking up at the world above, where Kristen Dunst lives.  They connected as children, were separated by circumstance, and discover each other through coincidences which necessitate scientist Burgess finding a way for them to be together despite physical and political boundaries that seem insurmountable.  This leads to a slightly awkward action theme of the upper earth bad guys trying to rip off Burgess' discoveries.  But how could a 3-D movie not involve action?
  I strongly recommend this film although I realize neither its theme nor its backdrop will appeal to everybody.  It's worth watching just for the visuals - but there's deeper beauty on so many more levels if you just sit back and enjoy the ride.",1395878400,4,1693,5.003571428571429

It is a quirky little fantasy...maybe more fantasy than sci fi, but I've now seen it 3 times and also introduced it to my daughter, who also loves it.  I plan to watch it at least every couple of months or so.  It is charming and lovely and sweet.

Upside down is a good story with a good cast and the plot progresses at the expected rate for most of the movie, but near the end the everything speeds up and then ends abruptly.

Basically, this is a story of forbidden love where the privileged girl from the upper world loves a poor  boy from the impoverished lower world. Both worlds are controlled by the same major corporation that only cares about profit. Contact between the worlds is forbidden, except what the company deems necessary. Throughout the movie, there is a lot of danger and the main characters are in constant peril, but at the end, once the two figure out how to defeat gravity to be together it jumps to where both worlds play nice with each other and the narrator (the main character) says that he could explain how all of that happened, but that is a tale for another story.",1394409600,,866,4.538461538461538

5598769,1,B00BEIYIUA,"This is ridiculous; I can't believe I watched the whole thing. I'll leave the plot and story and dialogue out of this, and just get right to the part that makes no sense whatsoever.

This: The planets are either round or flat; they can't be both.

If they are round, they either rotate, or they don't. If they don't rotate then only one particular part of the planets would be lined up to each other, not all parts. If they do rotate, then no parts would be permanently aligned to build structures between them.

If they are flat, then structures could be built between them, if they are stationary, however you would have issues like the oceans running off the edges and daylight only lasting for an extremely limited time twice a day (assuming this ludicrous pancake world is rotating on a common axis).

The movie depicts the planets as round, showing them as such, and showing beautiful sunsets and sunrises, yet the storyline acts as if they're flat with buildings attached between them, or two mountain peaks nearly touching each other.

It gets even weirder. If they were round, and the premise of the gravity of objects and planets were true, when the world rotated people from either side would fly off, or when on the opposite side of the world from the other world, they would be able to walk around normally. Assuming the crazy idea that gravity is in a general direction for either people, and not an attraction of mass between objects.

So none of this makes sense in any way whatsoever.",1393027200,3,1501,4.62406015037594
5598770,3,B00BEIYIUA,"Upside Down is not a good movie. To introduce its original premise, it begins with a ton of back story told in confusing ways. I lost count of the number of times I just didn't get what was going on. Where did those fences come from? Why did the big evil corporation leave Bob's exit pass on?

And there are contrivances galore such as the convent amnesia and recovery of memory by Eden. The narration is often over the top and silly.

Yet, it's not a horrible movie, it safely fits into the so bad it's good category. More often than not, their imagination of Upside Down Worlds lead to stunning visual effects. Even though our hero is constantly in over his head, there's something delightfully charming about his old mad dash. It's entertaining and enjoyable in its own right, if for nothing than all the questions it raises and never answers.

some nice CG graphics in many places.  The plot seems
absurd in its major elements (that 2 planets could be almost
touching each other but each one has gravity that works
in its own direction and doesn't affect the gravity of the other
such that they remain almost touching--then we're supposed
to believe our ""hero"" finds a way to travel to the other planet
even though his gravity would make him fall upward there...
In addition to being totally unrealistic, the ""plot"" is formulaic,
the dialog uninteresting, the chemistry almost nonexistent;
frankly I don't really recommend anyone waste their time on it.

Kirsten Dunst is luminous though, the only reason for watching this all the way through. I saw this over a month ago and almost nothing has stuck with me - that can't be a good sign!

The acting is superb, the visuals are stunning (not an easy feat these days), and the plot is both well-developed and well-paced. The issue of ""perspective"" alone--as reflected in the camera angles and interplay  of physical properties--is presented in a truly captivating and novel fashion.

5598877,2,B00BEIYIUA,"Le sigh. This movie is just pure eye candy. >,< Let's breakdown what I like about this movie, shall we?

a. Premise- Check.  Very original. It's not every day that I would come across a movie that is about 2 planets that are so near to each other that the different inhabitants could see and talk to one another. Heck, they could even work at the same company.

b. World Building- Impressive and the almost merging of the 2 planets is very seamless.

What I didn't like?

a. Characters-  Jim and Kirsten just lacked the chemistry to make it work.

b. Romance- Dull. It didn't have the intensity that I was looking for. It felt very high schoolish.

c. Beginning- The beginning was a major info dump with Adam lengthily narrating the whole idea about the 2 planets. Instead of showing, he's just telling us. >,< d. Plot- The plot was clearly driven by the bland romance. And of course, the story was riddled with plot holes.  For example, it didn't explain why ""down below"" is poor while the ""up top"" is rich. And why the freaking people are prohibited to be in a relationship from those from the other planet when it's okay to be working alongside with them in the office.

e. Ending- Huh? Was that the ending? Just like that? The obstacle faced by our hero and heroine was easily solved. And then there's a glimpse that the down below has already been improved implying that Adam's invention made wonders even if it wasn't shown how they were able to convince the government to implement the said changes.

All in all, if you're looking for a romance movie that would sweep you off your feet, better stick with Titanic.",1386201600,,1620,4.513698630136986

It has some interesting ideas, but either they edited out a lot or they just had a basic idea that they didn't have time or money to flesh out.  The  ""happy happy look at our bright future"" ending seemed forced.  Just felt like there was a lot not shown or given the chance to develop.

Adam lives in a world that is quite literally upside down - or right side up depending on how you're looking at it. A more accurate way to put it, perhaps, is to say that he lives in a ""lower"" world, while a ""higher"" world - which looks much like his world, only upside down - hangs above his head at all times. And if you're having a hard time envisioning what it is I`m describing, then I guess you'll just have to watch ""Upside Down"" for yourself to get the full picture. And what a picture it makes, as Adam falls in forbidden love with a girl from this reverse-gravity place, a land where all the wealthy people live and which is run by an all-powerful vulture corporation that literally looks down on the people below and runs their lives as much as possible - making this perhaps the farthest-out take on ""Romeo and Juliet"" ever put on film.

Adam decides to go to work for the TransWorld Corporation when he finds out that his Juliet, known as Eden, works there. The problem he has in getting together with her is twofold: 1) she is suffering from amnesia as a result of an accident and no longer remembers him, and 2) it is virtually impossible for anyone from the bottom world to cross over to the top one without being detected and summarily punished for the violation. Bob has also invented an anti-wrinkle cream based on the principles of anti-gravity that he hopes to market to the world above. But his main reason for being there is to reconnect with the woman he loves (and don`t think the two characters don`t wind up living up to their allegorical names in the end).

Written and directed by Juan Solanis, the French/Canadian ""Upside Down"" is one of those rare science fiction films that actually expands the limits of one's imagination.  Overflowing with you-really-have-to-see-it-to-believe-it art direction and visual effects, ""Upside Down"" takes us to a place we've never been to before and will likely never see again. It's simply that unique and visionary.

Jim Sturgess and Kirsten Duntz are utterly winning, charming and engaging as the couple caught between two opposing gravitational forces, and Timothy Spall is equally fine as Adam's co-worker from the upper world who befriends this starry-eyed newbie from below. And even amidst all the dystopic ""Brave New World""/""1984""/""Fahrenhiet 451"" - style tropes and trappings, Solanis has managed to create one of the most thoroughly captivating love stories we've encountered in quite some time.

5598909,4,B00BEIYIUA,"There aren't a lot of films out there that try to put you in a place that is totally foreign to what you are used to. I can name a few off with films like What Dreams May Come, The Dark Crystal, Labyrinth and more recently Avatar. Many of these types of movies create a whole different world around you. Upside Down makes what is very close to the world we live in now, but messes with the laws of physics and gravity to the point where what you get a completely new and fascinating experience. While this movie is not a high adventure or exciting action film it does thrive on its visual merits and solid, even if simple, story.

Upside Down is essentially a love story done in a fairy tale styled presentation. The story is about two people who fall in love, but live on different planets that are placed so close together that interaction between the two is possible. The downside is you are bound to the gravity of the planet you are from. So our lovelorn boy does everything he can to find a way to defy this reality and find his lost love. That's the story. Nothing complicated. And to be honest a more complicated story may not have lent well to this film. This is not to say there isn't a larger side-plot forming, but that is mostly there to tie loose ends. Besides the simple story does lend itself to giving you lots of opportunity to just soak in some breathtaking visuals.

Upside Down is full of fun scenery that plays with the whole two planets vying over each others gravity as well as simply beautiful landscapes, cityscapes and even ""office-scapes"". Yeah that picture on the cover is one of the more prominent sets and on a big screen it's nice looking. Those sets that play with the opposing gravity are creative and give that fantastical feel. If you like visually stunning movies this one will definitely win you over.

While I personally enjoy this simple love story set on this almost unreal setting I do understand the limitations of the plot do tend to downplay a pretty broad scope this universe introduces us to. More could have been done. I am okay with it not being done, but some of you may now. Also as much I try to wrap my head around this concept of ""inverse matter"" they use to help further the plot I have a hard time accepting the science behind it. Still it is a plot device that moves the story forward, and nobody said this was a hard science kind of film. As far as suspending disbelief it's not hard to simply accept the rules the movie has made for itself.

The Blu-Ray looks wonderful. The colors are sharp, and with every scene having a different color aura it only adds to the visual splendor. The image is clear, but I still note a light grainy texture that gives it that cinematic look. Audio is really impressive with the Dolby True HD 5.1 really taking advantage of the capabilities of surround sound. This is one of those films that enjoys putting atmospheric sound around you and the lossless track excels at it. I never saw the film in theaters in 3D, but the 3D Blu-Ray sure does impress. That aforementioned scene on the cover felt like the office area went on forever in 3D. You get a decent list of extra features that are on both the 3D and Blu-Ray disks. Interestingly enough on the 3D disk the special features are in 3D as well. Kinda cool even if they weren't made for it. Here is the breakdown:

The Making Of - This is a really good documentary. It covers a lot of details from the early concepts of the film to production, cast and more. It's good to see a good making of documentary on here. The last few movie extras I've seen lately this feature was more marketing hype than informative. Quite the opposite on this disk.

History of the World - An alternate opening with storyboards and commentary by director  Juan Solanas.

Deleted Scenes - Less than two minutes of footage from two extended scenes. They are incomplete with no special effects added. Not bad, but nothing was lost when it was taken out.

Juan and Jim - An odd short (like about 20 seconds) that is made to look like an old reel to reel short from the 1920's. Kinda fun to watch as a distraction.

Preliminary Sketches - 24 full color pre-production conceptual artwork.

Tango Storyboards - A short comparison of the final footage and storyboard artwork shown on a picture in picture screen.

Missing Forest Storyboards - Storyboards of a scene that was never filmed along with director commentary.

Sage Mountain, Office and Final Shot Previz - 3 short featurettes showing the previsualization of the scene along with director commentary.

Previews - The Upside Down trailer along with five other trailers that come up when you first put in the disk.

Upside down is a visual treat with a light dramatic/romantic story to give you an excuse to view all the great scenery. For me it works, but if you want a plot as big as your settings you may find the film lacking. Don't let that stop you from at least seeing it. For those of you who crave that cinematic grandeur of beautiful settings this is for you. In 3D would be optimal for at least the more far reaching sets, but it's not required. If in doubt maybe rent Upside Down first, and then decide if it's worthy of your colletion.",1383091200,,5221,4.4580712788259955

This is a basically a love story disguised as a sci-fi movie. The visual effects of an upside down world really are spectacular and this will be one to eventually buy. The story line flows pretty good and you actually end up rooting for the two lovers beating the system. This system juxtapositions the two worlds of haves and have nots and keeping each in their own place. Of course, our two lovers happen to be on opposite sides of the system (worlds) and must fight the powers that be to fulfill their love. For true sci-fi fans, you won't be disappointed.

Boy loves girl, something happens they are pulled apart then they find each other. This movie just brushes conflict off in order to move forward.

Not an easy thing to do in the film genre.

Yeah, I could pick it apart for some of its flaws and logic, but the same could be said of any movie that bends the laws of physics.

It's a solid premise backed by amazing visual effects. This movie is beautiful to watch and touching to the heart.

5598971,5,B00BEIYIUA,"I didn't realize till the end why I was loving this movie.

Its not an entirely complete story, not fully explained, its open.
Its a short story, or a novella.

I read a lot of short story anthologies, I'm a huge fan. This is set up like them, and looking at it that way, I see how pretty damn awesome it is.
My mind is left open on purpose, a lots left up in the air, and so the titles even more appropriate.

I hate sounding snobby, but its true what so much of the rest of the world sees Americans as, we expect a formula, and certain types of stories are the norm. Not all Americans, don't get me wrong. But too many loud and opinionated people see anything outside of what is their norm, as worth ripping apart. Movie goers themselves, nitpicking critics, a lot of people.

Well this isn't made in the USA, its French/Canadian, and I'm glad.

5598972,2,B00BEIYIUA,"This movie is a fantasy (it is set in an impossible world). It is not science fiction. You have to accept that premise, I think, for starters.

Even so, this movie didn't work for me very well. I gave it 30 minutes and then fast forwarded to the end.

I think it has two main problems:

1) It stretched credulity too far. I was not able to ""suspend disbelief"" and accept the world and its bizarre physics. I guess it's possible for a movie to be too imaginative. The hero's accent (New Jersey?) didn't help - why is a guy from New Jersey in this fantasy world?

2) The pace was too slow. It needed more urgency. The hero was too laid back. We needed to see him desire the girl more. We needed more tension and more tangible opposition to the characters' goals.

Also, Kirsten Dunst is a very appealing person but I just don't think she's a good actor. At least the director didn't bring that out of her.

Like I said, I didn't finish the movie. Did the characters grow by the end? If not, then that would be needed too.",1380585600,2,1019,4.22680412371134

5599007,4,B00BEIYIUA,"I do tend to gravitate toward stylish movies. Terry Gilliam, Marc Caro/Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Guillermo del Toro will always be among my favorite directors. So, when I heard ""Upside Down"" was a real piece of work I figured....go for it. It's a mixed bag.

Here's he scoop. You have two opposing worlds really close to one another. Each has its own gravity. The 'upper world' is the ""haves."" The 'lower world' is the ""have nots."" The upper world gets oil from the lower world which they turn into electricity to sell back to the lower world at exorbitant prices keeping them impoverished. Adam from the lower world falls for Eden of the upper world. Fate tears them apart only to have them meet up again years later. Can they overcome their class related predicament?

This is not unlike Gilliam's ""Brazil"" in that you have true love trying to be found in the midst of a repressive socio-political environment. It also can be seen as an indictment on the class widening in the U.S. as well as the west's siphoning of oil from the mid-east where all but the elite live in abject poverty. This is a great looking film to be sure. Great production design and color palette. This has style to the 9s. The cast is good as well. Kirsten Dunst, as Eden, is always likable and they paired her with Jim Sturgess (Adam) who might be a bit too cute and in need of a better hair stylist. But he, also, is likable. You want these two to make it. The problem here is the script. It's not at all a bad idea. It just needed punching up. Certain turns in the story needed more umph and it just wasn't there. And Dunst reveals something in a later scene which was out of the blue for me. Was something in the script that was left on the editing floor to lead up to this point or was it left out of the script entirely? Either way it was a screw up.

This is a really decent watch. Were it that bit better I'd consider a space for it in my library. As it stands, one viewing is enough for me.",1380153600,,1972,4.295698924731183
5599008,3,B00BEIYIUA,"""Upside Down"" starts with an unusual vision of dual planets close to each other, but the French-Canadian movie is primarily a love story about two lovers from totally different worlds. In this unique universe any communication between the rich ""Up Above"" and the poor ""Down Below"" is strictly forbidden. Also, it is physically impossible for the people of the Down planet to live on the other planet, and vice versa, because, due to the ""double gravity,"" they would be ""falling"" onto the ceiling.

Adam (Jim Sturgess), inventive resident of Down, infiltrates a big company, disguising himself as an employee from Up, in order to meet again Eden (Kirsten Dunst), a girl from Up he met in the mountains ten years ago.

The ""double gravity"" of the film is the force that divides the people into two. The stark contrast between the haves and have-nots is nothing new in sci-fi films these days (as seen in ""In Time"" and the new ""Total Recall""), but in ""Upside Down"" the conflict is visually presented by the upward/downward force.

The interesting concept serves as a metaphor for social issues like North-South divide, but it becomes tiring pretty quickly. The characters are not fleshed out enough, and action is often confusing. The most disappointing part is the ending, where it looks like the director suddenly stops telling the story as if he could not think of any better idea.

""Upside Down"" has stunning visuals of the dual planets, but is in need of a story that can interest us for more than 90 minutes.",1379980800,2,1511,4.822393822393822

5599012,5,B00BEIYIUA,"A beautifully filmed and sweet romance wrapped in one of the more intriguing and unique stories to come out in a while. Like Safety Not Guaranteed, this film asks you to make a leap of faith, though in this case that is made literal and is not left in question.

This is Dunst 's second foray into a unique genre film in as many releases. Her previous, Oscar nodded performance in Melancholia challenged audiences as well, though in very different ways. She brings just the right level of sweet naivete to support this story. Sturgess (Across the Universe) likewise brings a beautifully child-like, heroic drive and desire to the challenges that endears you to his cause. This sense of innocence and joy is important to the style and in no way weakens the movie.

Innocence is important because the script and logic only work if you take it as a fable. Certainly the opening implies you should. Whether that was a fix or an intent, I'm unsure and there was no commentary to fill me in. But be warned, if you are going for a solid science fiction piece, you're going to gnash your teeth at the incomplete logic and plot holes. On the other hand, if you watch as a fantasy or, better yet as I indicated, as a fable, you won't be disappointed. It is a glorious fable of love, life, romance, power, politics, and creativity.

Writer/director Solanas made bold choices and had a great time conceiving both the flow and the setting of the story. He has you fall into his world and plays with your perception without apology. It is a rich tapestry with a great deal of fun and thinking that went into it.

As a first major release for Solanas, it is magical and shows immense promise. I will definitely be watching for his next project. And, in the meantime, we have this incredible piece of magical romance to feed upon, and it isn't a meal you should miss.",1379721600,,1851,4.516417910447761

Second, the visual effects were awesome. It was a feast for the eyes. I felt wonder and awe as I watched this stunning story and visual effects. Third, it was full of love and hope. I walked away from this movie feeling wonderful. Really, no bad scenes!  So...why is this movie not even known to me until now!!!! Because it doesn't have the usual sex scenes and violence that comes from Hollywood movies. It relied on a well written story and great visual effects. It also relied on human strength and love.

5599020,2,B00BEIYIUA,"Just thought you might like to know that, if you didn't already.

Some stories are not meant to be told on the big screen.  They are too convoluted, detailed and heavy handed.  You can usually tell right off the bat which films these are.  About ten seconds into `Upside Down' I told my wife that Juan Solanas was trying too hard and that this story would be better suited for a video game.  When you have to introduce your movie through voiceover by explaining rules to understanding your story then you know you're off to a bad start.

`Upside Down', conceptually, is pretty interesting, but the first half is somewhat of a chore to get through and the simplistic afterthought of a love story becomes somewhat sketchy as Solanas starts breaking his own `rules' and pretty much throws his entire introduction out the window.

Why do you have to make things so complicated only to lazily uncomplicated them?

The story tells that of a poor kid named Adam who falls in love with a rich girl named Eden.  The `Romeo + Juliet' doomed relationship / Adam + Eve beginnings of creation aspects of this film are in full swing, and it becomes obvious by the films end that Juan Solanas is a dreamer and he wants us to be too.  I'm cool with that, to an extent.  Here's the trick, Adam and Eden cannot be together, not simply because Adam is deemed inferior and it is forbidden but because they physically cannot be together.  They live on twin worlds that are held together by dual gravity and so Adam walks on land beneath (or above depending on how you look at it) Eden.  Adam (or should I say, Jim Sturgess) explains all this in the intro and quite frankly it is tedious and complicated and, as I mentioned, was trying too hard.  The basic point is that if Adam goes to Eden's world he'll start to burn up and die.

Still, they meet as children in this place where their worlds come together and they form a relationship only to have a tragic accident separate them for years.  Adam is determined to be with Eden, no matter the cost, and quite frankly that cost could be his life.

Alright, the plot is thin, despite all the complicated details.  As I mentioned, Juan Solanas (who wrote and directed the film) is determined to create something unique and then he spends the better part of the second half of the film trying to skirt around his own creation.  The `burning up' aspect of transferring to the other world is a big hole in this plot because the time frame surrounding the `burning' seems to change every time Adam goes over.  One time he starts to burn after a few minutes, the next time hours, the next time it's almost like he never burns.  Then you have the `plot within a plot' regarding conjoining their gravity, which is interesting but underdeveloped.

Couple this with the fact that the film feels about twice as long as it really is, and you have a bad thing.

But there is good here.

Set aside the poor scripting, the underdeveloped plot and the lackluster acting (why is Jim Sturgess squandering his potential by continuously playing the lovelorn Romeo?) and you have a richly textured fantasy world that is mind-blowing in execution.  I'm serious when I say that these graphics are the best I've seen in film in YEARS, maybe ever.  The dual worlds, hanging above (and below) one another are seamlessly created and strung before us, and the visual depth of these sequences are astounding.  In fact, the whole technical side of this film, from the sets to the score to the beautiful cinematography are near perfection.  I've never wished so badly that a film was better than it was, because I'd love to look at it again and yet the idea of watching it a second time makes me anxious.",1379462400,3,3701,4.533132530120482

If they were trying to create a great storyline with a nice climatic ending then they failed miserably. I won't get into the physics of why things are like they are on their planet(s?) or the anti-big-oil undertone that may or may not have been intentional. The theme of forbidden love has been beaten to death. There was no depth to the characters. Nearing the end of the movie, I found myself not caring what happened to either one of them. I was getting bored with the effects because I started thinking about how beautiful our planet is. I'm thankful I don't have to look up and see a city-scape in the sky.

Two teenagers (one from each world) meet, fall for each other, something happens and they don't meet again until they are adults. Their goal is to be together but, they have an evil corporation with some prejudices and gravity issues to deal with.  Interesting ending that changes much.

5599181,2,B00BEIYIUA,"A French Canadian sci-fi romance that feels more foreign than it actually is. The scoop here is twin worlds, floating side-by-side through the cosmos with inverse gravitational pulls. What's up for one is down for the other and all that jazz; certain mountaintops or skyscrapers venture close enough to actually touch the opposite landscape. A lot of time and effort is sunk into explaining this concept, which seems like wasted effort because not only is it mostly self-evident, but the finer laws (like the idea that matter from one world bursts into flames after an hour on the other) are often broken without consequence as the plot gradually develops. The film's best qualities are undoubtedly visual. A concept like this one will often live or die by how it's visualized on the screen and, despite never completely shaking a major case of disorientation, it's a dazzling, vivid, mesmerizing display that downright demands our attention. It's a real pity those visual heights couldn't find an equally interesting story to partner with, because Upside Down's plot is a real paint-by-numbers stinker. It's shallow, predictable, slow and empty, without a voice of its own. Terribly acted and even more terribly written, with zero chemistry between its star-crossed leads, it's borderline insufferable and often makes for great unintentional comedy. Worth a quick glimpse, but strictly for the visuals - I'd recommend you watch it on mute.",1377129600,2,1440,5.211206896551724

I also feel like the movie was a bit slow in building momentum. It gets a lot better toward the end, but it took too long to get there. In fact, it almost lost me.

IMHO, Sci-Fi movies that sell a relationship as the overriding plot theme tend to fail in that regard almost every time on selling the theme. In this instance, as stated in the opening credits, the love theme overrides the laws of gravity (""changes the world"") as they relate to the worlds presented to us.  In addition to basically ignoring these laws from the outset, except where it conveniently fits the story line, the movie fails to present the chemistry between Dunst and Sturgess to sell that premise.  A good job is done in with the effects and some great ideas about how such a world may work in particular practical purposes and is worth seeing for that alone.",1376438400,,688,4.725

If you're looking for a quirky love story then I'd suggest something from Baz Luhrmann instead. In fact, I wish Luhrmann had directed this one.

That being said, and suspending ALL scientific disbelief, and categorizing this film as a complete FABLE (which is perfectly fine by me), I did enjoy it. Once the viewer takes a gigantic leap of faith and decides to let go and view this movie on a purely visceral level, the ride is pleasant and clever. I don't regret purchasing it, although I prefer sci-fi to be grounded in, at the very least, scientific THEORY - and fantasy to have strong mythical roots.

I must, however, sadly agree with a number of other reviews presented here that the 3D process here is VERY poorly executed; almost non-existent. I should have saved the half-dozen bucks or so, and just got the regular Blu-Ray.",1376006400,,995,4.77906976744186

5599299,1,B00BEIYIUA,"Spoiler Alert:
Okay; first of all if you only have a grade school education or perhaps watched a few episodes of The Universe on cable, then you are going to find the entire premise of this movie utterly absurd.
Gravity is one of the four fundamental forces of the universe. The more mass an object has; the more it attracts other masses. The very idea that two worlds only several hundred feet apart would not crash into each other is ridicules.
Secondly, you, or any other object on one world, would be equally pushed down towards each world. The objects in this movie act more like they have positive or negative magnetic poles.
Third; how is it that on one world (the wealthy world), which is about 15 stories away from the other world, has warm sunny weather while the other is cold and rainy? ""Their"" Sun would shine equally on each world, and actually where these two worlds are almost touching each other they would never have the Sun at ""high noon"" because it would always be blocked by the other world.
Also, anyone living below each world's equator would never be able to see the other world from where they are. And why do the people in the ""poor"" world keep saying they live down below. Everyone on each world would have to look ""UP"" to see the other world, so there wouldn't be any ""down below"".

But this movie is suppose to be about a romance so strong that a man from the poor world is willing to risk everything, including death, to be with a woman he hasn't seen in 10 years, and only knew an apparently short time when they were both young teens.
To be believable, that early relationship would have been paramount to carrying you through the rest of the movie; But instead it has a relatively short screen time.

The whole jest of this movie is that these two people, from two different worlds (which have their ""own"" specific gravity) will find someway to solve this problem and be together. In that regard, it seemed like you are left to figure out if that ever happened.

The special effects were only so-so (these days that bar is set pretty high), and the ""upside-down"" everything becomes a bit weary after awhile.

I watched one of the ""extras"" on the making of this movie and the French writer stated the entire idea came from a dream he had in which he saw these two people at the top of two mountains (inversed on two worlds) reaching out to each other. Might have been a nice painting, but NOT a 60 million dollar movie.

FYI: I'm not sure if the Blu-ray DVD would make this movie any better because that disc did not work for me. Amazon, with their great customer service, took it back without question. That is why I try only to buy items sold by Amazon, and not another retailer linked to their site.",1375747200,9,2734,4.438247011952191

The love story wasn't terribly strong, and I really didn't feel invested in the couple's future (which you MUST feel in a great love story). Parts of the upside-down world were interesting and kind of cool, like the office scenes, but overall I found it distracting to the storyline.

5599301,1,B00BEIYIUA,"Two different worlds exist right next to each other where all matter is pulled by the gravity of the world that it comes from, and not the other, an object's weight can be offset by matter from the opposite world (inverse matter), and after some time in contact, matter in contact with inverse matter burns. With such an interesting and unique dystopian sci-fi world you would think that Upside Down would be a compelling and entertaining film, but writer and director Juan Diego Solanas found a way to turn what could have been a good sci-fi film in Upside Down into a lifeless bore.

Upside Down follows Adam (Jim Sturgess) who lives in the poverty stricken Down world. The Up world is the prosperous of the two worlds full of wealthy citizens and lords over the Down world controlling and using the Down world for its own benefit. Cross contact between the peoples of the world is outlawed and forbidden unless it is regulated by the Up world government. At a young age Adam sneaks into a restricted area and encounters Eden (Kirsten Dunst) who is from the Up world. The two quickly fall in love and spend many hours and days together until the very young couple is caught and separated never to be seen together again. Ten years later Adam is researcher scientist working on so sort of anti-gravity product that could change both worlds, but fate has other things in store for Adam as he sees Eden on television who now works for TransWorld an Up world corporation who controls much of the Up world. This new element sets Adam on a race to see his lost love, and sadly ruins what could have been a quality sci-fi film.

With an interesting premise as two worlds right next to each other with two different gravity and types of world you would assume writer and director Juan Diego Solanas world focus on exploring the worlds, how they came to be, their histories and peoples creating a different film from what we are given, but instead Solanas decided to focus on the romance between Adam and Eden. The romance might have been more compelling if the characters, and their roles better performed by the actors playing them. The audience is supposed to root for Adam and his quest to reunite with Eden, but Adam is an uncharismatic bore which I blame both on the writing of Solanas and the acting of Jim Sturgess (Across the Universe, Cloud Atlas). Whatever Sturgess had in Across the Universe and Cloud Atlas he has lost here in his performance as Adam. Sturgess just lacks the charismatic charm and acting prowess to carry a film like Upside Down on his own. There is also Sturgess/Adam's lack of chemistry with Eden/ Kirsten Dunst which was just horrid to say the least. Kirsten Dunst (Original Spiderman trilogy, Interview with the Vampire and Wimbledon) has an empty shell of a character to work with in Eden. Solanas did not write Eden with a fully fleshed out backstory and the character pays for it. Plus Adam's and Eden's romance just is not believable with the characters and actors lack of chemistry. Dunst and Strugess had no chemistry what so ever which really hurt the film. Maybe if the film had a compelling and heart wrenching romance the film could have at least have been a decent romance film, but Upside Down completely fails at that. Usually if the stars of a film do not have what it takes to carry a film than the director and stars can count on the supporting cast to support them, but the supporting cast in Upside Down is nonexistent.

For a modestly budgeted film the effects are pretty good as they do an effective job of showcasing the world Juan Diego Solanas has created highlighting who the two worlds and their gravities operate, and at certain points in the film the effects are really impressive. It is too bad that Solanas did not write an interesting story to go along with his unique world that he had created. Speaking of director Juan Diego Solanas, I believe the Argentina was out of his depth with Upside Down. The director is unknown to me, but I believe that if he had gotten help with the script and directing to bring his vision to life than Upside Down could have been a higher level of a film.

When it comes down to it with Upside Down we are left with what could have been. If the film had a stronger narrative and better written characters that explored the unique sci-fi world and vision of Solanas than I believe Upside Down could have been a really remarkable sci-fi film, but instead what we have gotten is a terrible romance film with sci-fi elements in the back ground along with some good effects, bad acting, and even worse directing turn Upside Down into a unremarkable mess that audiences should just plan skip.",1375660800,4,4676,4.596407185628743

5599303,4,B00BEIYIUA,"Their is no doubt Upside Down is a genuine marvel to look at. The story itself is your archetypical tale akin Romeo & Juliet with a sci-fi edge thrown in for good measure.

The 3D is a step behind the rest of the movie however,which is a crying shame. Don't get me wrong,the 3D is decent,but theirs so many missed opprotunities it really left me scratching my head. For instance,this film has quiet a few moments were we see a lot of snow,yet it's never given a pop out 3D treatment. Watch the Imax 3D film ""Rescue"" and then compare it's snow effects with Upside Down. Their is none. The best supplement the 3D offers is it seems to really compliment the cold and isolated feel of the movie itself. I definitely think the 3D adds a certain amount of look to the film,it's just I saw so much potential unfulfilled.

 In conclusion Upside Down offers us nothing new in terms of the timeless love story,but it does place it in a very strangely beautiful setting,and I kept thinking about the film after I watched it,so it's very apparent something about it stuck with me.

There are so many inconsistencies for convenience sake, you'll spend the entire movie remarking on them. Maybe that's the most fun you'll get out of this flick. Watch it with someone else so you can enjoy being snarky.  Anything difficult to explain happens automagically off camera. The script is dismal. There are multiple long make out scenes to fill in the time. I mean looonnnng scenes of making out. Just making out. Long. It feels like the director just doesn't care. One of the 5 worst movies I've ever seen, except for how it looks. It could have been really interesting if a different director had made it as the premise is promising.

I really liked Inception, but the Inception plotline let the FX folks do just about anything with the people and props because  -- it's just a dream and who are you to say what my dreams are like?  But Upside Down's theme was a science fiction account of twin planets sharing an atmosphere. They somehow stayed in such close proximity that they formed a ceiling-floor relationship to each other, and their highest peaks were mere yards apart. Further, objects on the each planet obeyed rules such that they were subject only to the gravity of their own planet; if they were somehow moved to the other planet, they would 'fall up'.  Right away, such plot devices made me start thinking about why such schemes would not work, rather than concentrating on the narrative, which in itself was thin gruel.  It was basically Romeo and Juliet, where one planet is populated by overlords and the other by serfs.  I don't think one can be fully entertained by the acting and the plot.

5599392,1,B00BEIYIUA,"This was the worst 3D I have ever seen. It was converted to 3D after the movie was shot, but I guess they didn't have the budget to pay someone to do a professional conversion. Not only is a there a lack of depth, but there is a very strange, disturbing look to the picture, especially when there is any motion going on. It's hard to describe, but there's sort of a flashing or strobe effect going on. I thought maybe it was an artistic effect, but it was actually starting to give me a headache.

After ten minutes I had to give up on it. I thought that maybe the disc was defective, but it was brand new from a sealed box, and when I switched from 3D to 2D mode the strobe effect stopped and the movie was watchable. Unfortunately it still wasn't interesting. Some of the other reviews here have pointed out some of the flaws of this movie, so I won't bother to repeat them all. Visually, even without the horrible 3D conversion, it looks monochromatic and not very exciting.

It's a pity. I get the feeling the people who made this movie were trying to do something a little different and really tried hard to make it work, but the end result feels overly obvious and boring. And they can't possibly have thought the 3D conversion really looks any good. That was just a cynical marketing effort. I've learned my lesson... only main stream big budget movies can afford to do proper 3D conversion. I suggest you don't waste your waste your time and money on this.

One final observation: After looking through some of the other reviews I didn't see any that described the botched 3D conversion in any detail, as I've attempted to do. Why is that? I couldn't really say. Maybe someone did describe it, but I just didn't read every single review. Or maybe people who bought the 3D version want to sell it and feel bad reviews will hurt their chances of making a sale. Personally I wouldn't feel right trying to sell it.

But the large looming figure is that the story is so rushed that many things are left out or are so unbelieveable due to lack of explaination or planning. The end is the WORST ending I have quite literally ever seen in a film. Now on to the 3D aspect of the film. With so many animated parts and potential for screen pops this movie is flat.

Apart from that, I was not too impressed.  There were just too many instances where the physics, or continuity fell apart.

In one scene, his tie is perfect.  In another, it's suddenly pulling a ""Dilbert"", pointing up.

Dialogue between the two love interests: ""What are you doing here?""  ""I'm looking for my dog.""  (What?  On the top of a mountain? They are each on the top of a Mt. Everest type of mountain.  Your dog?  Really?)

5599484,2,B00BEIYIUA,"This film was a total waste of effort by the effects team because it attempts to deal with story built upon a preposterous and inconsistent premise.  The fantasy of negative gravity could have been interesting if there was some consistency in its application.  However, the screen play chose to ignore its premise whenever convenient to further support a manufactured story dependent upon the premise.  What the viewer gets is a circular mess of inconsistency that is almost comical in its execution and a screenplay that seems to make things up as it goes to get one to a very predictable conclusion.  While I think Jim Sturgess, and to a lesser extent, Kirsten Dunst made a decent effort with such weak material, it is a shame that the effort put into a premise without regard to consistency, made the entire film a meaningless waste of time for the viewer.  I can admire those filmmakers who successfully use a hypothetical setting to add a contemporary relevance to an old story, but in this case, it stretches credulity so much as to cause the viewer to completely discount the premise.  The only entertainment provided by this film is the visual depiction of a world within a world where negative gravity can exist.  If you can get past the absurdity of the premise, you will not be able to accept the convenience of inconsistency in its application.  A Romeo and Juliet who must overcome gravity is an absurdity that I can do without.  What a shame so much visual artistry was wasted.  I suppose it only demonstrates that visual effects, no matter how well done, cannot be the foundation of  a good film.",1374624000,3,1611,4.738351254480286

I won't spoil the ending, but if you follow the storyline about what gravitates towards what planets, etc - it makes you feel like they had no better idea of how to end the story, so they just picked an idea out of a hat.

5599491,4,B00BEIYIUA,"The film opens with a lengthy narration explaining the fictional scientific laws of the worlds and how society is structured. It is a bit confusing, but as soon as you see it in action, it becomes apparent. This is a love story about people from two different worlds. The film oozes with symbolism about our society. People who are rich are attracted to the rich world. The poor live as mudlarks valuing anything from the rich world. A heartless corporation forms a link between the two worlds exploiting the poor for the sake of the rich. They rob them of their raw materials and sell back the manufactured product.

The scenery and special effects was excellent. Kirsten Dunst's character Eden, was never developed. We didn't know much about her. Adam (Jim Sturgess) we knew more about, but he needed a haircut. They kept his hair greasy and unkempt for effect, but for me it was a needless distraction.

The attraction the couple had for each other was carried to an extreme. After being separated for ten years, Adam hasn't moved on. Seriously? Eden, has amnesia and is unattached. The story line needed tweaking, but then don't most romances.

5599590,4,B00BEIYIUA,"This movie is visually stunning, but don't expect a coherent story. The plot is essentially a planetary version of Romeo and Juliet, with an interesting astrophysical premise. However, there are plot-holes galore in this movie and often the romance seems forced and fickle. That's not to say that if you wake the story at face value you won't enjoy it; even though I nit-picked every little detail while watching it (and there are a lot of glaring inconsistencies), I still enjoyed the movie as a whole.

What this movie has going for it the most are the settings and cinematography. If you are a fan of the Final Fantasy series of video games, this is definitely a movie you would want to watch. It very much resembles Final Fantasy in its setting and visuals. If they would have called it Final Fantasy XVI: The Movie, I would have believed them. A lot of the technologies, story ideas, and setting concepts seem straight out of those games.

Some of the major problems I had with the movie, however, emerge from the combination of the two aforementioned components of the movie: its romance story and the setting/aesthetics. One problem I had is that this seems way too massive of a concept to have just been shunted to a simple romance movie. The movie really tried to make the romance live up to the epic qualities of the universe in which it took place, but I don't think it quite made it. The universe seemed much more epic in scope, and the love just seemed to dumb things down. The reason Final Fantasy works (and, perhaps, why the actual FF movie didn't) is because those games have large universes that you can explore for more than 2 hours (the time a movie allows you). I really think the concept of this movie would have worked better as a video game (if the mechanics could be made to work right, this would make an amazing MMORPG), TV series, or novel. (Or, as a series of movies, but, seeing as the movie got overwhelming negative reviews for some of the elements that I am highlighting, that seems unlikely.)

The reason I would have liked to see this more expansive format is because the interesting lore parts of the movie, and the more in-depth elements, were ignored and just pushed to the beginning and end of the movie, where they were just explained by a narrator's voice. This was so we could get to the love faster. However, as I've said, the romance plot was full of holes and, without other plot elements to go along with it, distilled the movie down into something less epic than it should have been.

I think this movie has something, but we just aren't given enough of that something.",1373846400,,2616,4.559574468085106
5599591,2,B00BEIYIUA,"To begin with the idea behind the central theme wasn't thought out well enough to be believable. The acting was good, but character development was missing.  Too bad I wasted my time and money on this film.",1373846400,2,206,4.5675675675675675
5599592,2,B00BEIYIUA,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

Wow, what a mess. Judging from the trailers, Upside Down had the potential to be really good. The concept of two worlds with opposite gravity is one that I've never seen before and it looked like a strong basis for a good story. Unfortunately, Upside Down never takes advantage of what it could have been because the entire film feels flat. The story, the acting, everything, it all feels so lifeless and dull. Add that to the fact that they do a very poor job of explaining how the gravity between these two worlds work and you have a mess of a film. I actually had to look up the rules of their gravity once the film was over to get a better understanding of how things worked. They tell you at the beginning of the movie, but they kind of blaze through it and it doesn't give you enough time to process because you haven't seen these rules in action yet.

In the movie they kept saying that there were two worlds - Up Top and Down Below - but it never felt that way. Instead, it always felt like one world that was split in two halves which resulted in their gravitational pulls being switched. Tell me this, if two worlds really were circling around each other, would the people be able to see the towns and cities of the other world in detail? No, that wouldn't make sense. Well, would they be able to be connected through a huge corporate structure called TransWorld? No, that would require a really, really, really tall building. This is what I mean. Instead of labeling these as ""two worlds"", they could have come up with a solid back story for one world instead of not giving us anything for either of them. The only thing we truly know about these worlds is that Up Top is rich and prosperous while Down Below is poor and dirty.

Upside Down follows the story of Adam (Jim Sturgess), a man who grew up in Down Below. As a child he met Eden (Kirsten Dunst), a girl from Up Above. It's law that people from Down Below are forbidden to speak to those from Up Above. Well, over time, these two gradually form a relationship until they eventually get caught. After a major fall, Adam doesn't see Eden for ten years. While at work one day he sees Eden on a game show and sets out to find her. It doesn't take long before he finds out that she is suffering from amnesia which is a result from her fall ten years ago. Adam's mission has now changed into a journey to win back the heart of the woman he loves all while not getting caught by the authorities.

While I originally thought the romantic story between Adam and Eden looked captivating, I now realize that it made Upside Down wasted potential. Part of this is because Adam and Eden aren't terribly interesting characters. Not only that, but the scenario of two individuals being separated because of social class has been so overdone in film that in no longer seems to have any sort of impact on me. I found that I was more interested in the world and how it worked and I really didn't care about either of these characters. In fact, the only character I actually liked was Bob (Timothy Spall), an employee of TransWorld that Adam befriends. Sadly, he is only in the film for a few brief scenes.

The things is, there were times where Upside Down embraced what it could have been. You'll find these occasional moments of brilliance during the films 107 minutes, but, sadly, there's not enough of it. There was a point towards the end where Adam was in Bob's house and they were mixing matter from both worlds to create a gravity resistant material. When I saw that my jaw literally dropped and I couldn't help but ask myself why there wasn't more intelligent, thought provoking scenes just like it. Everything goes back to the wasted potential and I feel like Upside Down could have been a brilliant film had it been done right.

Don't get me wrong, Upside Down isn't all bad. Visually the film is gorgeous and I wouldn't have a problem saying that Upside Down's visuals are its strongest attribute. There's an obvious difference between these two ""worlds"" and I think the grey and yellow/gold contrast each other beautifully. My only complaint about the visuals is that, at times, I felt like Down Below was too bright. Whenever Adam was walking outside I found that I had to close my eyes because they began to hurt. It was really weird. I think part of this is because there's so much grey and white in the surrounding frame that it became slightly overwhelming. Other than that, though, the film is truly a thing of beauty when it comes to the world(s) these characters are inhabiting.

Overall Score: 4.25/10 - Unfortunately, you need more than some pretty colors and landscapes to make a film enjoyable. Upside Down is another one of those films that attempts to do so much, but accomplishes so little. The plot was boring and, at times, predictable and the two leads weren't anything to write home about either. While Upside Down may have had a solid idea, it's brought down by a poor script and a somewhat generic story. I really wanted this film to work out in spite of all the negatives comments I read while watching the trailer, but that's not what happened. While I can't say that I would watch it again, I would recommend giving it a viewing on the visuals alone. While it may not be the best film in the world, it's one of the most visually beautiful movies I've seen in a while.",1373587200,,5406,4.47112462006079

That being said the story, or better yet the plot falls pretty flat - a bit more than I expected actually. The premise of this movie is not that bad, but while watching it I could not make up my mind if this was trying to be more of a fantasy or a wanna-be gritty story. It also seemed as if the plot was not fully developed or pushed where it could have gone - interaction between the characters and line of events felt a bit disconnected, and I ended up wandering about several things that were left unresolved. Some scenes, dialogue and narration I found plain cheesy.

The 3D effects were nothing special and they really did not take advantage of that tech.  The visual effects were pretty cool, minus the 3D.  I had a real problem however with the inaccuracies of the story.  This is not really a spoiler as you learn this in the first 2 minutes.  There are 2 worlds, each with their own matter that CANNOT commingle - be KEPT in the other world.  It's actually the entire basis of the movie.  However, in scene after scene after scene you see walls, windows, clouds and rain in both worlds.  There would have to be a definitive separation (going by the storyline) on ALL of those items - on every item - and there is not.  That is just sloppy sci-fi.  Take a look at the office scene on the cover even.  There MUST be a seam in the windows (and walls) where one world's glass meets the other world's glass.  There is not!

I know, I'm being picky.  But hey, when your entire story hinges on the FACT that NO matter from one world can live in the other world and you constantly make this visual mistake all throughout the movie, I gotta call FAIL.

So:  Story is boring, 3D is lame, visuals are pretty cool, neat sci-fi idea executed poorly.  Waste of time soon to be forgotten.",1373328000,2,1406,4.310344827586207

5599656,2,B00BEIYIUA,"The trailer originally attracted us to Upside Down and after watching it we believe it is an odd movie without execution on all the high notes.  On the surface, the concept of two worlds, sharing an atmosphere but separated by a distinct gravity is exciting.  The two worlds are a new concept.  A science fiction lover would appreciate the subtle anarchistic slum of below as a sharp contrast to the perfect distopia of the above world.  The graphics are stunning, and always poetic.  Sharp, mountain vistas give way to an inverted gleaming skyline.  Pay attention to the breathtaking paraselene effect on the summit of the two worlds.

Character development on the other hand is not this movie's strong point.  At first my wife and I thought Kristen Dunst was cast too old for this movie.  My wife suggested Jennifer Lawrence!  After conclusion Kristen Dunst was appropriate for the movie, and that's not a good thing.  Her role as *spoiler* an amnesiac, starry-eyed ex-teenage lover didn't leave anything to act.  We've seen this play before, but never on an inverted stage.  Kristen Dunst used all of her talents, the girl next door gaze, and the adoring smile.  Alas, Eden as a character is one dimensional and a shameful romance novel trope of lover/amnesiac.  She even manages to sneak in the disgusting and derivative ""Spiderman kiss"" except she is the one who is upside down!  The actor was very good, and played his role as the nerdy, obsessive scientist to the T.

If you're still reading, you must wonder why I am writing this review.  This movie is a warning.  It is a warning to those in Hollywood who would release a genre bending Sci-fi/Romance movie and fail to execute either the romance plotline, or the sci-fi plot to any acceptable resolution.  Give us two, deliver one plot line to a climax, but don't drop both balls!

We have the romance plot starting with 3 strikes against it: Its a flashback driven teenage lusty relationship, amnesia has been done to hell in other movies, and the actress is neither sufficiently beautiful to desire or complicated enough to be interesting.  The entire romance part of this movie was the first 10 minutes in the beginning of the movie, 5 minutes of flashback, and the ""kiss in the sunset moment"" of the finale. What was the rest of the movie about?

Now as a male, sci-fi lover I am very sad to say the rest of the movie was setting up the glorious inverse worlds.  I love the interesting class warfare undertone, with the oppressed begging to have some justice.  Unfortunately there exists no justice, and as one character puts it ""the top side always wins"" which was a overt scolding of the audience who expects a glorious revolutionary climax.  Critical plot technology is revealed in the first 10 minutes.  I had expectation of a Deus Ex Machina moment, like Star Trek where Wesley Crusher puts two screws and a tricorder together to save the Enterprise!  Unfortunately while those of us in the audience are expecting the protagonists to use this technology to emancipate the underclass, or at least, give a finger to the man, the protagonists use this technology... to make babies.

To my relief, even the said making of the babies was an off screen conception.  In conclusion, we have an A+ film school class project movie with AAA visuals tied to a boring, been there romance plot and an interesting sci-fi stage.  There are some glimmers of brilliance in the office scenes, especially the subtle references to managerial desk being high above on the ceiling!  The end of the movie leaves so much to be desired, it screams that the producers were banking on a sequel.

Unfortunately their target market of sci-fi lover and and romance lover were highly teased but never satisfied.  For a movie featuring two opposite worlds, it never succeeds in uniting sci-fi lovers with romance junkies.",1373155200,2,3856,4.801213960546282

None of our group of 9 people (adults & kids) had seen the trailer or knew anything about this movie, so we had zero expectations going into it.

+ Yes, the visuals are perfect for the mood they are trying to create.

+ Yes, the soundtrack adds to the mood of the scenes. I wound up getting my hands on the soundtrack later...great music.

+ Yes, Jim Sturgess is great in his unassuming manner.

- No, Kirsten Dunst didn't get a chance to do a lot of ""acting"" in the movie in my opinion, as she was more of a supporting role, so it could have been nearly any actress playing the part.

+ Yes, the science/science-fiction was intriguing with the possibilities the script could have taken the story in could have been more and did in some cases. Some missed opportunity, but enough sci-fi that it adds to the plot.

+ Yes, Timothy Spall turned out to be my kid's favorite character.

- No, the movie didn't fill every plot hole...holes remained.

- No, the ""renewed"" love between the characters seemed too sudden, as if they knew they needed to end the movie so the script accelerated things

OVERALL: Beautiful movie to watch. Some tense moments. Good sci-fi / science elements. Could have done better without the rushed ending, but our entire group of five adults and some teens/kids enjoyed the movie a lot.

If you like movies with fantastic landscapes, then this movie may be up your alley.  You also need to really like fairytale romance stories.  Even if you like both of those movie elements though, ultimately this movie would probably disappoint unless you just are enthralled with the two main romantic characters.

<***spoiler alert***> The plot is just a very unevenly paced love story that is missing all of the social revolution elements needed for the love story to actually happen.  I mean, she has amnesia for ten years, sees him, of course, after a few days remembers him and their teenage romance, and then is madly in love with him suddenly?  Things just overall happen too sporadically.  How does he go from being a nobody to suddenly being a goose with the golden egg for the Transworld Corp., but no one notices him hopping planets?  You'd think they'd have paid more attention to his comings and goings.  But, all of that aside, you kept expecting him to use his pink powder to create a revolution for the people ""below"", not anti-aging cream.  It is completely foreshadowed and really the only way you can imagine the love story working out. They can't be together ""happily ever after"" unless their worlds radically change.  They basically tell you, yes, we changed the world, with the last 2 minutes of the film, but say ""that is another story""?  WTH?  That would have been the story to tell.  Changing the world for the love of your life would have been an entertaining plot.  Getting my butt handed to me only to have other people suddenly come to my rescue is not a great story to tell.  So again, (and even with what I have laid out, I don't think I given away too much of the plot), if you still want to rent the movie, make sure you are just a tissue abusing romance junkie who digs special effects.

The visual side is amazing, that's a given, every scene is like one of those futuristic abstract artwork I used to be a fan of from big sites like 2advaced or Chpater3.

The romance.. I say they pushed it, I like both Kristen Dunst and Jim Sturgess appearance, I think they have ok chemistry, but just don't expect something like lets say Jack and Rose that kind of tension.

Its over all easy come and go movie, they have an interesting idea  but they're limited on what they can do, and they round it up to what is being seen now.

Personally I think if this is a musical like Across the Universe would be much better.

5599726,3,B00BEIYIUA,"The best thing I can say is that ""Upside Down"" might be the first real art film that's accessible to tweens.

It's visually stunning. It's evident from the start that the film was made by an auteur. It's a unified creative effort that comes straight from one individual's heart and was interpreted by others who *FELT* the auteur's vision. The actors lovingly render to the best of their abilities some really bad dialogue. So ""Upside Down"" certainly scores an A for effort!

But sadly, the film doesn't really work because the screenplay feels cobbled together with no sense of cinematic storytelling. The lack of narrative clarity throughout ""Upside Down"" speaks to why most films follow a three-act story arc.  Sometimes a lack of structural integrity can actually work onscreen (see ""Holy Motors""). But it doesn't work here because ""Upside Down's"" linear, fairytale sensibilities are undermined by its lack of plot cohesion. And I could tell about ten minutes into the film that although it's an English language movie, whoever wrote the dialogue was thinking in another language.

""Upside Down"" has soul and it's easy on the eyes, but its lack of brain undermines its heart and style. I do hope the director finds a proper writing muse to work with on his next effort, because there's a lot of genuine talent and vision on display in ""Upside Down"" that's not fully realized.

Final word? Worth seeing despite its many flaws. It's something special, but not at all perfect.",1372204800,,1477,4.939516129032258
5599727,2,B00BEIYIUA,"There may be spoilers...

Not having read anything about this movie, the premise seemed interesting and I'm always up for some science fiction nonsense.  Unfortunately this film by Juan Solanas has the visual gravitas but lacks interesting leads and a script that led me to shaking my head.

Actually more of a fantasy than sci-fi, there are two worlds, twins if you will, that apparently rotate together in orbit but a few feet apart.  Each has its own gravity, so in a common office scene, the people above you appear upside down.  Each world has its own political and cultural system as well.  One world is inhabited by the working class.  It is ugly, mostly barren and in need of an influx of capital.  The other world in controlled by a giant corporation and is where the wealthy live.

Travel between the two worlds is prohibited and physically problematic otherwise.  Young Adam (Jim Sturgess) likes to scramble to the highest peak, never mind how he manages to get there.  He meets a young woman named...wait for it...Eden (Kirsten Dunst) who also likes to hike to this same peak but on the wealthy world.  Recalling Dunst's upside down kiss with Spider-Man, the couple manages to hook up this way until they are discovered by the authorities.

As the years pass, Adam discovers that Eden was working for the corporation bad guys.  He had thought she was killed during that earlier confrontation with the cops.  Nope.  Just lost her memory.  As luck would have it, Adam is also a top notch chemist and has discovered an anti-aging cream that gets him a slot at the corporation.  This of course, gives him the opportunity to reconnect with Eden.

While this might sound interesting, it isn't.  Dunst and Sturgess do what they can with the lame script but their relationship is boring as hell.  At the end of the film Eden tells Adam that she is having twins, I'm thinking when the hell did that happen?  I actually think there's a good movie in there somewhere, but this isn't it.",1372204800,9,1987,4.682080924855492

5599729,1,B00BEIYIUA,"I bought this movie based on reviews here, and couldn't be more disappointed. It's just a plain stupid production about gravity and upside down people on different parallels portraying infantile little tricks you can do between upright and upside down people to bring these worlds together. Illegally, of course. Movies don't have to make sense to be enjoyable, but this really tests that bleeding edge. Makes you wonder who comes up with this kind of stuff, or worse yet, agrees to dump money into it. Now I need to go watch another movie to shake this one from my head. Where did I put that Spice Girls movie I've been wanting to see?",1371859200,5,636,4.6371681415929205
5599730,4,B00BEIYIUA,"I enjoyed this a lot. It's not a shoot 'em up space-ship type sci-fi movie. More on the lines of Ursula LeGuin.

Such a crazy idea and cool special effects make up for the main actor's lame voice-over and inexperienced performance. Plus, more Kirsten Dunst! She's under-used here, and she's always great whatever she does. The visuals make this film worth a second look. Really different.",1371427200,3,388,4.878787878787879
5599731,5,B00BEIYIUA,"I had not even heard of this movie and after seeing the trailer bought it. Obviously you must suspend belief at every turn but it still boils down to the basic love story of two people that can never be together. It was very good, action for the guys and romance for the girls. It's worth the time to watch it.",1371254400,,310,4.098360655737705
5599732,2,B00BEIYIUA,"God, what a waste of time this was to watch. In a world with no explanation as to why, Earth, I presume, has another version of itself right next to it. Somehow gravity and laws of physics allow the two planets to co-exist. There is a building that magically never breaks as the two worlds spin that is joined to each other. One is considered the poverty world, and one the richer side. Two kids from each planet end up meeting on a high enough mountain where they communicate with each other. They end up falling in love, and then something happens and he thinks she's dead. Only she isn't, so the next day he goes to work in the building with an idea to make an anti-wrinkle cream based on gravitational pull, while secretly trying to find her on the other world. There so called Romeo & Juliet tale is not, it was a boring story and no emotion to any of it. But I get it, two loves forbidden, blah, blah, blah. It would have been a better movie if they focused more on the plot and making these characters something more than just two people who met, and you know exactly how it will end. Instead the attention is mostly focused on the CGI work, hence, another Matrix movie... little plot, no interesting story, just a bunch of visual effects to say, ""Hey, look what we can do with computers... oh yeah, throw any old story around it, who cares, people will love the effects and not worry about the plot"". Nope, not the case here. Nice visuals, terrible movie.",1370476800,4,1463,4.362637362637362
