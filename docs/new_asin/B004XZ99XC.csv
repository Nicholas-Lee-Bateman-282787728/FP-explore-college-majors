Also, Mom has Alzheimer's & I thought this would bring back some old memories.

Yes, I would recommend this product.",1452038400,6,379,4.6716417910447765
4498479,3,B004XZ99XC,The first 15 minutes of this DVD is advertising for old TV show you can purchase.it will not let you fast forward through it so your stuck watching the ads. The Honeymooners shows are great but I only watched one episode so for me to see the rest I will have to sit through the advertisements to watch the next episodes.,1434153600,4,320,4.262295081967213

4498487,2,B004XZ99XC,"The thing that really bugged me about this DVD is you have to sit through 20 minutes of commercials before you get to the Honeymooners episodes.  There is advertisement after advertisement for other DVDs and the main DVD menu is disabled until you watch all the advertising.

When I buy a DVD and pay money for it, it should be totally free from any advertisement or it should clearly state on the box that the DVD contains mandatory advertising that you must watch in order to get to the main feature.

Tried to return the DVD because of the advertising, but the local store said they were not allowed by laws passed by the movie industry to give a refund on any open movies.  They are allowed to exchange only.",1404604800,10,712,4.453846153846154

4498490,4,B004XZ99XC,I am not a fan of Honeymooners but I got it for my husband.  He loves it.  You can see that it is old film.  If you love Jackie Gleason buy it.,1394496000,,143,3.40625

4498496,5,B004XZ99XC,"I was a bit worried because I had read mixed reviews but this dvd really did have lost episodes and the best part is that they are unusually long episodes not of the 20 mins type but more of the 35-45 minute shows that were not so punctuated by commercials. Another thing I like is that they do not have the usual Honeymooners stage backdrop. All of the shows have some real physical scenery, i.e, on the streets of NY.",1370736000,24,419,4.25
