It is a case of several couples trying to pretend to be in love with somebody else in order to make their boyfriend or girlfriend jealous.  It all turns out quite comical.  It is a movie from the more traditional era of Mexican films.  Taking place in Jalisco and featuring lots of the charro songs and culture.  Elvira Quintana really shines in this movie as the camera really captures her beauty and she has some very pretty song solos.  She's very flirtatious in this movie in the more light and traditional Mexican way.  An excellent movie that I highly recommend!",1210032000,,638,4.584070796460177
