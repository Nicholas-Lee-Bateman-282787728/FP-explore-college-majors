We had many of these movies already, but several were VHS versions & having them all in one place is a great space saver as well. With the additional information and organization, it was a wonderful way to increase his collection of anything that has to do with the ""Duke"". He was especially excited over the belt buckle & it is proudly displayed next to other items he has received over the years. Now I have several VHS & DVD movies to pass on & his collection of movies is almost complete.",1473638400,3,621,4.271186440677966

6249608,1,B00I46NYIM,"I did not buy this collection but read the reviews.  I also am a great fan of John Wayne and have 45 plus dvd's of his, mostly the newer ones, but also the important older ones like Stagecoach.  Again dvd's since they are much cheaper than Blue Ray.  However, if you really want one of the best collections of John Wayne movies, try John Wayne Century Collection.  Amazon has it.  It is worth the money. A few of the movies in this collection are not in it, but they are the ones I really was lukewarm about anyway.",1441324800,3,515,4.214285714285714

6249613,5,B00I46NYIM,"I have loved John Wayne movies since my father introduced me to them as a child, back in the days before VHS and DVD.  This collection contains many of his classic movies, as well as some early films I had not seen before.  If you have not already gotten the various classic Wayne films in this collection on DVD, then this is a worthwhile purchase.  If you already have gotten most of his classics (e.g., The Searchers, Rio Bravo, The Shootist, etc.) or are just interested in his best films then this collection might not be for you.  I personally get a kick out of what some people would call lesser films like McQ (John Wayne aping Dirty Harry) or the Green Berets (generic WW II style action movie, but in Viet Nam) so those plus the early stuff made it a good choice for me.",1433635200,,780,4.321917808219178

The Comancheros; Sands of Iwo Jima; The Quiet Man; Brannigan; Red River; Hondo, Stage Coach, Flying Tigers, McLintock, The Undefeated, and Big Jake to name a few. If you're going to put in How the West Was Won, (where he had just a small part), why not include The Longest Day, (where his part was longer).

Why isn't ""Stagecoach"" here? The early cowboy westerns are fun, but ""The Man From Monterey"" is like a bad high school play, the acting and dialog are so stiff.

Heck, my Mom's been gone for a while now but just noticed HER favorite - ""The Sands Of Iwo Jima"" is missing too!",1399248000,38,443,4.091954022988506

8639140,5,B00I46NYIM,"One of the most important things anyone would want to know about a set as large and pricey as this is how the picture quality is, especially the really old ones from the 1930s. Unfortunately I couldn't find that info in any of the reviews. I'm NOT an expert by any means so im not going to get technical. To come straight to the point, ALL THE MOVIES LOOK FANTASTIC!! The really old ones look as good as the old Twilight Zone episodes from the early 60s. Any Twilight Zone fan will tell you that those Twilight Zone episodes look great!! The only difference in these old early John Wayne movies is the first 5 minutes or so are scratchy looking but quickly clear. The sound is also excellent. These films are coming from the companies that have the best known film elements, so you won't find them anywhere else, looking and sounding this good. AS far as I know, this is the absolute BEST John Wayne set there is in DVD format. Buy it now while you still can at a reasonable price.",1483574400,,981,4.336956521739131

8639142,3,B00I46NYIM,"I got this gift for my husband and he loved it!  Down side is I ordered this 2 months before giving it to him, as we have gone through the dvd's watching them, 4 so far have had glitches and stopped playing.  Since I gave this to him after the 30 days there is no return option or trade in for a different one, it wasn't a cheap gift and really wish he could watch all of them.  We have not gone through all of them yet but very disappointed that 4 of the 8 we have watched we were not able to finish, we still have many more to go but at this rate only half of them have played all the way through without issues.",1482278400,8,614,3.8188976377952755

8639144,4,B00I46NYIM,"Missing some movies such as ""Rio Grande"" , ""The Quiet Man"" and ""Hellfighters"". is a good collection but could be better if have added others.",1478390400,,141,4.68
