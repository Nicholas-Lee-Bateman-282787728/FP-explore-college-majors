5337160,4,B009H6YF9K,"I know I didn't buy my copy on Amazon and this says 2004, but the truth is the guy who made this got it released just this year. There's two fan made episodes, both project 131 made with actual cast members and a pilot for a new YCDTOTV. The pilot looks a like it was made with a real shoe string budget, but you can feel the effort put into making it. What really stands out though is that this guy even got an interview with Roger Price! If you're waiting for them to release the show, this can tide you over with some of the things you might not have known. Otherwise, please tell me the number of fish in Lake Superior.",1353801600,13,623,4.073170731707317
5337181,5,B009H6YF9K,"Rather than critique this video (which is worth watching for both nostalgia and insights into the show) I'd like to take my space to rant on my mystification that YCDTOTV has YET to get a dvd release and only a partial streaming reissue.

You Can't Do That On Television is not just a footnote in children's television. It was a FANTASTIC show with unique qualities. It had some great assets - principally the incredible and versatile Les Lye who could give anyone on SNL a run for their money for characters. Christine McGlade, Lisa Ruddy and of course Alastair Gilles are the true teen stars that could. And unlike other shows before or since, they more or less played themselves. The structure of the show, the understanding that all the cast was fully aware that they were employees of a cheap cable TV show, was an innovative device that allowed them to play themselves while exploring single topics from every angle possible.

Alanis Morrisette was on the show. Les Lye gave us at least 3 memorable, classic characters - Ross: the company shill, Lance: the bum father and the grotesque Barth. The show spawned many catchphrases like,  ""I don't know."" ""You got a point there Valerie!"" and ""I heeeard That!""  And famously the show gave us GREEN SLIME. This element is still used today, not only in Nickelodeon promos and shows, but also Disney and other kids shows. Whenever you see a show where a character receives a comeuppance with a large pile of muck sliding down over their face, that is the legacy of YCDTOTV!

It was probably the only show that recognized the dark genius of truly embarrassing children. Which is what it subconsciously feels like to be an awkward and powerless teenager. Where as today's shows herald a world of hip, obnoxious, crafty youth who live to get everything they want, YCDTOTV wanted to humiliated it's kids as much as possible. It chose NOT give the kids what they desired by making them have a father who was a dirty, slovenly BUM that was possibly an alcoholic. Make them eat at a disgusting, vomit-inducing restaurant run by an unhygenic derelict. Educate them in an oppressive Monty Python-esque school, while they were forced to work under a cranky, shifty producer (Ross) who barely paid them anything.  Sounds closer to real life!  They then had their egos shrunk by getting watered, slimed and hit with pies as often as it could be written into the show. There is even a subversive educational element to the the idea of punishing someone when they ""Don't Know,"" something. Be smart kids...BE SMART!  As a viewer there is even a little subliminal trauma in the fact that cast members disappear from season to season or episode to episode. Some age out, while some are there for just one or two episodes. Then wooosh, they're gone - with no one addressing it.  Did they get turned into sausage for Barth's Burgery?

So why, after all these years is YCDTOTV not on DVD? There must be a rights issue somewhere. But the show has no music rights to clear and this was a cheap show made in Canada no less!  All I can assume is someone is being an A-hole or completely underestimating it's status, audience and money making potential. The show ran for 11 years and then countless years after in re-runs on Nick. The show probably has a 15 year span of kids who are now adults who watched it. Why sit on the property? As time passes this interest will simply wane - and we are quickly moving out of the DVD era of watching. Yet there are only a few episodes available to stream (not restored, either). How difficult can all this be? I have a hard time believing this can't make SOMEBODY money! Sometimes I believe there is something going on behind the scenes - that there is an issue with Nickelodeon being embarrassed or undermined by its existence somehow or that the rights owners feel the content would just be too scrutinized today - i.e, ""The show is too mean!""",1422835200,3,3909,4.642547033285094
5337182,4,B009H6YF9K,"This was pretty good. The only disappointment was that I wish they would have showed clips from the show. As a kid who loved You Can't Do That on Television, and SLIME, I'm glad someone put the time into making a documentary on it. It could have been better but it is what it is and I appreciate it. I loved seeing everyone all grown up and finding out facts about how things worked behind the scenes.",1422230400,,401,4.220779220779221
5337183,5,B009H6YF9K,"For me, summertime was You Can't Do That on Television!  I grew up watching this show and have remained a fan of it.  I've seen Project 131 and Slimecon and now this and I believe this is the best of the lot.  I love all the real insider view on how the show was actually done and what the cast thought about all of it.  I thought it was put together extremely well and it certainly has brought up many fond memories of watching the show.  This program is a must for any true YCDTOTV fan!",1421539200,3,488,4.041666666666667
5337184,5,B009H6YF9K,This was my favorite show as a kid. Well this and pinwheel. Loved seeing everyone grown up and hearing the history.,1410652800,2,115,4.523809523809524
5337185,1,B009H6YF9K,Do not buy this DVD. It doesn't have any of the skits on it. The whole DVD is just lectures about the show and cast.,1410220800,,116,3.68
5337186,5,B009H6YF9K,"Your childhood was awesome because of Roger Price. The man conversed with David Bowie and the term Homo Superior gave us Oh! You Pretty Things and The Tomorrow People, the good one. He makes a kids' sketch comedy show in Canada we get Jagged Little Pill, that creative force which is Adam Greydon Reid, and green slime.

The technical side of this DVD doesn't matter, it's about the interviews, the information, the joyful little bits you learn about the most awesome kids show ever made. And it was as awesome to work on as you thought it was. The grown up kids speak with honesty and delight, and some times deep emotion, about their time on the show, co stars, and production staff, and especially Les Lie. Writers and crew let you in on the secrets of the success on why the show lasted so long and why a PBS clone failed including reasons it probably wouldn't fly today.

This is an absolute must for any fan of You Can't Do That On Television. Being that Amazon offers a few volumes for viewing you'll be able to convert more people. This is what fun TV non educational that allows you to abandon your cares for a few minutes is all about. Looking at the currant crop of Nickelodeon shows we'll never have it again.",1394582400,7,1221,4.446428571428571

5337188,3,B009H6YF9K,This DVD had a few good moments but not enough for 4 or ever 5 stars.  Poorly put together.  I really wanted to like this. . .,1374969600,,126,3.6296296296296298
5337189,5,B009H6YF9K,This video was very good and I was glad and happy to see it again :) I would recommend it to anybody that saw it in the 70's and 80's that like it or loved it as a kid or teenager or an adult :).,1369958400,2,195,3.3555555555555556
5337190,4,B009H6YF9K,It was a good documentary and the new DVD episode was funny and a original episode.  I would recommend it.,1364688000,3,106,4.3
8541588,4,B009H6YF9K,"Considering the director had little to no budget and couldn't use actual footage of the show, it is very informative and well done. Strictly for fans who fondly remember YCDTOTV.",1525478400,,178,4.966666666666667
8541589,4,B009H6YF9K,"The only thing I have to note about this, is that it is a Fan made film. Although the interviews are good, the quality of the video varies from excellent to very grainy and bad. It was great to see and hear all of these interviews with the cast, just wish the video quality was better.",1496966400,,285,4.107142857142857

8541591,4,B009H6YF9K,"It was nostalgic and enjoyable to see the former child cast members as adults, to hear from Les Lye and to learn about the empowerment of youth that Roger Price supported. I would have liked to see more clips of the past episodes. I think the flow and nostalgia would have been better  had pictures of each of the former cast members as children been shown when they were introduced as adults. I was impressed with Adam Reid's thoughts and realization that in today's stifling and oppressive politically correct climate, this show could never be recreated. I agree with him that if someone isn't ""getting offended"", there is no point in the show. Overall, for the fan of YCDTOTV, this film is worth a watch!",1459209600,,707,4.656
