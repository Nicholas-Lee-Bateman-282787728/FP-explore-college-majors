1194412,2,B000006GDN,"Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer was created in his 1947 novel ""I, the Jury"" at the very peak of film noir and he went on to be featured in numerous films including ""I, the Jury"" (1953), ""My Gun is Quick"" (1957), and ""The Girl Hunters"" (1963). He was played by Biff Elliot (1953), Ralph Meeker (1955), Robert Bray (1957), and even Mickey Spillane (1963). The character is most associated with Stacey Keach who played him in film (1983, 2003) and on TV (1984-7), although personally I prefer Darren McGavin's interpretation (1957-8).

Unlike his fellow literary gum shoes Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe, Hammer tends to be more pragmatic and brutal, and the film is true to the novel in that respect, as it is with Hammer's secretary being more than a pretty face. But the story has been updated for the 40s to the 80s, and given a slick James Bond type opening, and I'm not sure this works as well.

Tough guy Armand Assante (1949) plays Mike Hammer. New York born Assante is best known for his gangster roles in films like ""Hoffa"" (1992), ""Chicago Overcoat"" (2007), and ""American Gangster"" (2007). He was nominated for a Golden Globe 4 times and won an Emmy for ""Gotti"" (1966). Unfortunately he mumbles so much in this film it's really hard to understand him.

Sexy Barbara Carrera (1945) plays the femme fatale. She is best known for her role as Fatima Blush in ""Never Say Never Again"" (1983) for which she received her second Golden Globe nomination. The film has Carrera in full frontal nudity, as well as lots of soft porn elements which may offend some people.

Lovely Laurene Landon (1957) plays Velda, Hammer's loyal secretary. She's probably best known for her role as a female wrestler in ""All the Marbles"" (1981) and the stewardess in ""Airplane II"" (1982).

Paul Sorvino (1939) plays Hammer's detective friend. Sorvino is best known for his recurring role on ""Law and Order"" (1991-2) and as the mob boss from ""Goodfellas"" (1990). He always gives good performances - I like him best as Henry Kissinger in ""Nixon"" (1995).

Comedian Alan King (1927-2004) has a small part even though he is billed third.

The film is directed by Richard Heffron (1930-2007) who is best known for ""Futureworld"" (1976) although he worked primarily in TV (""The Bold Ones"", ""Banacek"", ""The Rockford Files""). This was his last film.

The NY Times liked the ""spectacular chases and ingenious gore"" and said Assante's ""charming half-sneer and easy registering of delight and pain are almost irresistible.""

The top grossing films in 1982 were ""E.T"", ""Tootsie"", ""An Officer and a Gentleman"", ""First Blood"", and ""Rocky 3"". Oscar winners were ""Ghandi"" (Picture, Actor, Director), ""Sophie's Choice"" (Actress), ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" (Supporting Actor), and ""Tootsie"" (Supporting Actress). Other notable releases were ""My Favorite Year"", ""Personal Best"", ""Fast Times at Ridgmont High"", ""Victor/Victoria"", and ""The Verdict"".

The plot is kind of crazy, with sex therapists, CIA agents, sex fiend killers, mob bosses, corrupt police, and who knows what else. Since the sound is so poor, you can barely understand what's going on anyway, which is probably a plus.

Bottom line - not the worst Hammer film, but certainly far from the best.",1330905600,,3215,4.968342644320298

The film captures the Mike Hammer character well though I do feel Stacy Keach was the best and Assante's portrayal gave him an interesting Italian feel. Great visuals from wardobe, to feel of the city, to the eye candy.

Lauren Landon ... what is there to say.  But the story is awful.

1194418,5,B000006GDN,"No doubt he was compared to Pacino at the time, but Assante IS  Mike Hammer. His tough as nails attitude that he brings to the role is mesmerizing. The opening title sequence, with music by Bill Conti was very well done. I also think that the filmakers were hoping this would be the first of many sequels or chapters ( much like James Bond 007 ). Sadly, this was the only one starring Assante. I would have loved to have seen a series of Mike Hammer adventures on the big screen, but we were instead jilted into the awful TV Series starring Stacey Keach. I, the Jury, remains a first class thriller. The plot is complicated, but Assante steals the show as the womanizing PI. If this movie were made today, it would be unrecognizable. The gratuitious nudity would easily offend today's feminists so that would be cut. Then there's the graphic violence which would be too much for today's overly sensitive audiences. I,the Jury, is filled with politically incorrect scenes and roles, but that's what makes it great to watch today. The supporting cast is also wonderful to watch: Paul Sorvino as the police Captain, Alan King as the Mafioso boss, and Barbara Carerra as the Sex Clinic doctor. The action is swift, the music is first class, and the women are goregous. Assante delivers on all levels and the direction is as sharp as the dialog. If you can handle the pace of this mystery-thriller and the no-holds- barred Mickey Spillane, then buy this one today. ( Not on DVD yet-Only VHS )",1179532800,12,1487,4.611320754716981
1194419,3,B000006GDN,"This is a 1980's updating of the classic 50's pulp novel by the great Mickey Spillane  and it has its fair share of  violence and sex -and is not recommended for those who find such elements unacceptable .

The script is by Larry Cohen -who was originally slated to direct but was removed from the project after shooting began .His script has little to do with the original book and if you want a movie that follows the Spillane plot then you need to go back to the original .

Mike Hammer goes hunting for the guys who killed his old army buddy and in so doing finds himself up to his ears in a complex plot involving the Syndicate , the CIA and mind control techniques being used to create robot assassins .There is also a sex clinic stirred into the plot along the way .

The story is frankly untidy and sprawling  and the movie would have best been served by adhering to the pure lines of the original novel rather than pursuing then modish ideas and plot devices .The movie is thus incoherent at times and it seems as if some quite large chunks of plot exposition were jettisoned in order to make room for more action sequences

Ignore the confused and disjointed plot however and there are some good things about I, The Jury -the action scenes are well handled ,there is the odd sharp and cynical line and the acting especially from Armand Assante as Hammer is good .

Its not a bad movie but given the talent involved it could and should have been a lot better .Watchable -if you are stuck for something better to do",1104796800,7,1523,4.3568904593639575

1194421,3,B000006GDN,"This is pretty much a 1982 by-the-numbers rehash of both the Mickey Spillane 1947 novel and the 1953 film of the same name.  Here, though, Mike Hammer's secretary Velda not only carries a gun but can use it as well as her boss.  And here as well, unlike the 1953 Hollywood Code restrictions that kept film directors from showing all the naughty bits, director Richard Heffron can display Armand Assante's Hammer and Barbara Carrera's sexy Caroline Bennett going at it with wild abandon.
This movie moves through its Spillane-juiced plot fairly effortlessly.  Assante is fine, Paul Sorvino is appropriately tight-lipped as Pat Chambers, Mike Hammer's police force contact, and the women all flagrantly disobey women's lib edicts of equal status and respect by submitting (either immediately or eventually) to Hammer's virile presence.
Spillane was known, when he started out, as the number one purveyor of pure pulp in detective fiction--i.e., overt sex and violence.  Heffron's film gives a few sly winks at this; the director realizes that juxtaposing some of the writer's themes with '80s mentality fits and doesn't fit, both at the same time.  This paradox mostly works because nobody watching the film has to think much about anything at all--it IS pure pulp.  Hammer is subjected to the pain of seeing the corpse of his best friend and to some gritty torture, later in the film, and this all adds to the juicy pulpy ride.
Not great, but not bad.  An evening's diversion for those of you who don't mind a slightly sarcastic ""return"" to the mores of the '50s couched in '80s 'hipness'.",1038528000,11,1588,4.947368421052632

1194452,5,B000006GDN,"I have always been a big fan of Mickey Spillane's hard-boiled, two-fisted private detective Mike Hammer, the original ""badass"" way before the term was coined, from the literary to the film and TV versions.  Since the character's introduction in 1947 in Spillane's first Mike Hammer novel ""I, The Jury,"" Hammer has been played by numerous famous and not-too-famous actors, including Biff Elliot (in the 1953 adaptation of ""I, The Jury""), Ralph Meeker (1955's ""Kiss Me Deadly""), Darren ""Kolchak, The Night Stalker"" McGavin (the 1958-1960 Mike Hammer TV Series), Mickey Spillane himself (1963's ""The Girl Hunters""), Kevin Dobson of ""Kojak"" and ""Knots Landing"" fame (in the 1981 TV Movie ""Margin For Murder"") and Rob Estes (in a 1994 re-imaging of the character in the TV movie ""Come Die With Me"").  Of course, for TV viewers of the 1980s-1990s, the actor most identified with Mike Hammer was Stacy Keach who played the role in three TV series and several TV movies.  Somewhere along this long list of Mike Hammer incarnations was a 29-year-later re-make of ""I, The Jury"" starring then up-and-coming tough-guy actor Armand Assante, who eventually ""made his bones"" playing sinister anti-heroes and Mafia mobsters (like the title role in the 1996 HBO ""Gotti"" movie, where he won a Best Actor Emmy Award).  Critics and audiences back then felt Assante (who had strong Italian features) was miscast as Hammer while lambasting the overall quality of the film as more of an ""exploitation""-type flick.  In retrospect, the 1982 version of ""I, The Jury"" is actually fun to watch for some laughs, cheap thrills and uncut gratuitous sex and violence.  One can forget production values and quality when Assante's charisma and femme fatale villain Barbara Carrera ignite the screen.",1467936000,2,1765,5.153846153846154

A buddy from 'Nam is murdered senselessly and Hammer sets out on revenge to find out who did it and why. The road is paved with the wrong intentions from lots of suspects, even his buddy in the NYPD, Pat Chambers (Paul Sorvino, ""Goodfellas""), who may be playing both sides. A sex therapist (Barbara Carrera, ""Never Say Never Again"") isn't playing it straight with Hammer from minute one, until he delves deeper. A CIA operative named Romero tries to stop Hammer when he gets too close to anyone connected with the murder, and sends a terminal psychotic (Judson Scott) to run interference, who dresses up his female victims like redheads and then kills them! Along the way, a mobster (Alan King, ""Just Tell Me What You Want"") is also an accomplice.

1194523,4,B000006GDN,"TV-like in scope, but cinematic enough in its flavor, Richard T. Heffron's film of the old Mickey Spillane crime potboiler is in many ways a very good movie to watch. And by this, I mean that there is plenty to see here: beautiful naked Playmate-like women, a bizarre sex clinic scenario, a few chillingly violent murder scenes, some rampaging car chases, Armand Assante toting a M-16 rifle while chasing down bad guys, and a steamy as winter windows love scene between the gorgeous Barbara Carrera and Assante. Visually, the picture offers much, but story wise, it seems to go for an ""I'm too sexy for my script"" approach and loses some of the menace that came with earlier black and white films involving the Hammer character. In fact, it seems in the end that ""I, the Jury"" depends upon the sexual appeal of its great cast more so than it does a commitment to Spillane's grim source material, despite the fact that the film has some slasher-movie moments and some harrowing chases that attempt to elevate it beyond the usual erotic thriller film. Nonetheless, the movie is a quality mystery in many ways, making a good double feature with something like ""The Big Sleep,"" or ""The Man with Bogart's Face,"" or even the old Mitchum sleeper ""Farewell, My Lovely."" Beginning life as a screenplay composed by Larry Cohen, the production's troubled history is documented elsewhere, but I enjoy this final remnant of the American Cinema company--despite the fact that films like ""The Octagon"" and ""Dogs"" aren't necessarily on the higher end of film preservation lists, American Cinema did give the world many memorable titles...despite its ultimate corruption of Cohen's written material, I doubt that it was ever possible to ""miscast"" Mike Hammer (considering the fact that Ralph Meeker, Darren McGavin, Stacy Keach, and even author Spillane have essayed the role of the character at one time or another, on both the big and small screens). However, Assante does play Hammer a bit more flippantly than Robert Bray in 1957's ""My Gun is Quick"", for example, lacking the savagery and misanthropic detail that others put into him; yes, the picture is rushed, unrealized, and scattershot, but even though it may be a real loose canon of a film, it is still entertaining enough to register (no matter how ""cheap"" and inconsequential it may ultimately be). Still, ""I, the Jury"" is a good example of Hollywood ambition at its sexiest; Assante is attractive, the women are unbelievably hot, and the pacing is pretty intense. While the violence is not quite as graphic as I recalled in my memory, some of it is still pretty vicious (and I don't remember if the Fox Movie Channel version was a widescreen print or not), and this is an old-style detective picture that is better than any of the dehumanizing films that we are being fed today (sadly, there do not seem to be any good lone individual private eye movies being made of this caliber anymore). If you are offended by the nature of the film's graphic sexuality and its rather flippant violence, ""I, the Jury"" may not be to your taste, but if you want a brave and adventurous movie that shows signs of having way too many creative hands stirring in the pot, then pick this one up (whether you can get it on video or on DVD--a Blu-Ray, I'm afraid, only exists in my dreams).
Apparently, ""I, the Jury"" is now available for purchase as a DVD-on-demand item through the Fox Cinema Archives line (the ""release"" date of this item is listed as March 17th, 2015 on Amazon's page), finally restored in a 1.77:1 frame and in a letterboxed format. Sadly, I didn't realize this when I paid out a bit extra for a very good--but out of date--original VHS tape copy instead--but I'm not too bummed, since I am a collector. Still, while the VHS is not in widescreen, it appears to be a 1.33:1 TV print--pretty good overall, since it doesn't cut anyone's head off or push any characters out of the frame during a scene, but I may end up springing for an archive DVD print of this one. Why other American Cinema titles have been released widely on DVD with fine extras and restored picture quality and sound (such as ""The Octagon"", etc.) but ""I, the Jury"" continues to be ignored my major quality DVD distributors is a mystery in itself that I can only attribute a problem with mainstream distributors securing the rights to this one for home video. Not the best movie ever made, sure, but if you like the tough and gritty Mike Hammer mysteries, this is one curio worth checking out and keeping. B+",1427241600,7,4522,4.725316455696203

1194528,4,B000006GDN,"First, Armand Assante is a perfect Mike Hammer.  I've read some of the books by Mickey Spillane and I think he nailed the role.  The storyline is a bit different from the book, but filled with action, sex and tough-guy attitude.  Not for the kiddies, but a great popcorn and wine (or beer) movie for a Friday or Saturday night.",1411084800,2,327,4.416666666666667
1194539,5,B000006GDN,"Good 1980's film.  Not enough flesh for my tastes, but then graphic skin/sex didn't market well in 1980's America.  Still, Armand Assante's wonderful body should have been accentuated a LITTLE more than it is.

Interesting and a little titillating.",1409616000,,248,5.3076923076923075

Sorry for the inconvenience but it was Ok,Please don't refund the money.

1194542,4,B000006GDN,"If you like detective movies with a lot of drama and action this is a very, very good movie.

1194544,5,B000006GDN,"I liked it because it was based on a Mickey Spillane novel. It has action, drama, real sexual content, rape, murder, and etc. Barbra Carrera is great in her role as is Armand Assante. Very good movie to see and add to your collection.",1391299200,,234,4.340909090909091
1194545,3,B000006GDN,"This movie has a rousing score by composer Bill Conti. In fact, the score is what keeps the movie moving, that and a good performance by Armand Assante. There are several excellent chase scenes and although very gory by the standards of the day, modern day zombie-killer shows and movies are far, far worse.

The plot is a little(!) convoluted, but at least Mike Hammer keeps focused on his personal goal: Who killed my buddy? Barbara Carrera is beautiful and does a good job, as does Paul Sorvino, but everyone else is just routine.

So, great action score + exciting chases + Armand Assante = Pretty Good Movie",1383868800,,612,4.657407407407407
1194546,4,B000006GDN,Very enjoyable film about Private Detective Mike Hammer (Amande Assante) and his investigation into the death of a friend which leads to Run-ins with the Mob and CIA. Fast paced and great funny dialogue from Assante who is very good in this film. Great supporting cast and great chemisty between Assante and Laurene Landon. Solid action scenes and great story. I won't give any more away. Definitely worth a rental or purchase from Amazon Instant. Glad that this was finally available to buy in HD instead of just rental only as this film is not yet available on Blu Ray or DVD. Worth the $11.99 purchase.,1358726400,2,605,4.716981132075472

1194548,5,B000006GDN,"Cannot understand why this very entertaining Mike Hammer is not out on dvd yet, at least not that i know of. It's got just about everything you would want in a private eye movie as another reviewer indicated, and is fast paced, excellent cast, and many eye-popping moments for a film of that time. Come on whoever owns the rights, get it out so we can enjoy the wide screen version remastered, should be able to put some features on it as well, but considering no-one's bothered to even release it on dvd maybe no features will be included but JUST GET IT OUT !!!",1347580800,,563,4.371428571428571

7904440,3,B000006GDN,"It's OK but really dated and brings back memories of the early 80's when a tough guy was actually only an unreasonably lucky wiseguy.  Some movies age well but this is not one of them.  I'm not sure if I ever saw the 1953 movie version, but remakes are in general embarrassingly lame in comparison.  The book was written in 1947 and I suggest you do yourself a favor and skip this movie remake and read the book.",1499299200,,412,4.256410256410256
