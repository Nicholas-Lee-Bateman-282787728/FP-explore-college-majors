7913990,4,B00000JYIT,"A low-budget Depression-era potboiler without much going for it - except for Burt Reynolds. He gives one of his greatest performances as a borderline psychotic moonshiner who doesn't want his daughter involved with a WWI veteran. What would have been a completely despicable character with anyone else is actually sympathetic and likable with Burt's deft, multi-faceted and understated portrayal. A highly entertaining film which ends up being far better than it would have otherwise been.",1207353600,2,489,5.533333333333333
7913991,2,B00000JYIT,"It would have been better without Carradine (What is with that stupid smirk on his face?). Haley Du Mond is beautiful and talented. It must have been a chalenge for her to act as though she loved Carradine's character. Reynolds was good but the flowing long hair in the 1920's? The diologue was also inconsistant with the time period, as were many other details. The sound quality was [poor]. It is too bad because with a little effort this could have been pretty good.",1031875200,,469,4.595238095238095
7913992,5,B00000JYIT,"Richard Weinman does a lot with a little budget in this vehicle for Burt Reynolds with some of his most colorful work in years.  When have you seen Reynolds cry?  -- after committing murder. He is sardonic, evil and sympathetic.  The ensemble work is superb with Keith Carradine solid, and Pat Hingle wonderfully venal. Newcomer, Hayley DuMond, carries her weight and often the weight of the movie itself.  She is the center of the emotional storm, complex and driven.  Weinman's choice of authentic folk music is worth the visit alone. I had a good time.",985392000,9,555,4.8
7913993,4,B00000JYIT,"I have always been a big fan of Burt Reynolds.  Even though I haven't enjoyed all of this movies,  i think that he isa highly underrated actor.  It does me good to see him in a great role.  Hunter's Moon is one of those films that you see sitting on the new release shelf at your video store and you wonderto yourself why you've never heard of it. It could mean one of two things.  It is absolute straight to videocrap or could be an overlooked gem that is actually worth your time.  this is one of the latter.  I was very suprised at how enjoyable it was.  There is a great sense of atmosphere through the effective use of musci and Reynolds does some of his best work in years. I'm sure that he signed on (to steal a line from Smokey and the Bandit) ""mostly for the money"" but here he gets to have fun playing a complete mad man.  The( )main( )plot( )is fairly straight forward but the side plots do add texture.  All in all, it's a lot of fun and it's worth a couple hours of your time.",978912000,7,989,4.077720207253886
