1859890,1,B00008RUY6,"I got this movie on the strength of Tomaselli's first film ""Desecration"".  His debut had promise, and although somewhat flawed, it showed a talent for atmosphere and the macabre, obviously influenced by eurohorror directors.  I expected as much if not more from this sophomore effort, but I found myself seriously disappointed.  It's not the disjointed structure of the film that bothered me but the amateurishness in the setup of many scenes, the floating pumpkins, the black goat wandering into the left hand side of the frame at the beginning, the changing portrait a la Dorian Gray, are some examples of the awkwardness here, the effect was laughter on my part, and I'm sure that was not the director's intention.  Another fatal flaw is that there is nothing that is remotely scary or tense and the horrid acting certainly doesn't help.  I'd hate to think of Tomaselli turning into the next Ed Wood, as there were too many good signs in his first film for things to end up like that.  I hope he finds his way with his next effort, but as for this one, I just can't recommend it.",1056931200,3,1082,4.668421052631579
1859891,5,B00008RUY6,"After watching Dante Tomaselli's first movie DESECRATION, I was awe struck at the raw talent of first time producer Tomaselli.  When I found out that he was releasing his second film I ordered it right away, hoping that HORROR would be half as good as DESECRATION.  Tomaselli has once again proven himself a master of a compelling puzzle of psychological horror and gore.  Another familiar face in HORROR is the star Danny Lopes (Bobby in Desecration).  Lopes gives an amazing performance, sharpening his acting skills and drawing in the viewer.  This is one of the summers hottest movies, that you will be sorry you missed.",1056758400,3,624,4.904761904761905
1859892,2,B00008RUY6,"This film is plodding, incoherent, and put me to sleep two nights in a row.  Sure there are some frightening visuals (not as crazy as Desecration's scissor scene, however) and an eerie circular plot structure, but this film is just hard to get pulled in by.  I kept wanting to pay attention and get ""into"" the story, but I found it too out-there to follow.  I'm very glad to hear that Tomaselli's new film ""Satan's Playground"" will have a strong script and a plot that the audience will be able to follow.  Buy this film if you like; however, I do expect you will be a bit disappointed in this sophomore effort from a hopefully soon-to-be-great filmmaker.",1054944000,3,655,4.572649572649572
1859893,5,B00008RUY6,"Horror is completely entertaining. The scares are frightening, and it's impact is indescribable. Director Dante Tomaselli blows my mind once again. After viewing Tomaselli's first and highly recommended film ""DESECRATION"" I knew I couldn't miss out on this unofficial sequel. Gorgeous colors and amazing sounds keep you hypnotized to the screen. HORROR is addicting, it lives in my DVD player. A classic for sure! Not just for horror fans, but for movie fans. Horror has a little bit for every one, of all ages. You definitely want to add this DVD to your collection. Enjoy.",1054166400,,574,5.052631578947368
1859894,4,B00008RUY6,"I thought the DVD, ""Horror"", was excellent.  The opening sequence was extremely eery and gave you an uneasy feeling going into the movie.  You had the feeling throughout the movie that you were having a hellish nightmare.  You never knew what was looming around every corner. I especially liked the in and out appearances of the goat.  He was one scary goat!!!
Overall, I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes to view a good movie.  It will be a living nightmare.",1054080000,2,472,4.63855421686747
1859895,4,B00008RUY6,"(Note: my four-star rating above is really closer to three-and-a-half.)
 Independent filmmaker Dante Tomaselli is a talented visual stylist who loves to conjure up macabre, grotesque visions and hallucinations. He's primarlily interested in the feelings and moods evoked by classic horror films and irrational childhood fears, and narrative takes a very definite backseat to all of this. What little plot there is involves the escape of four teenagers from a drug rehab clinic and their subsequent nightmarish encounters in some sort of supernatural netherworld. It's basically a reality vs. illusion puzzle. Some of what goes on seems to be paranormal, but you have to take into account the fact that some (but not all) of the characters are high on magic mushrooms. In a manner reminiscent of David Lynch's recent films, past and present become confused, the ending dovetails with the beginning, and the characters seem to be caught in a nightmarish loop. If you can't do without a conventional storyline no matter how enthralling the imagery or intriguing the narrative puzzle, you'd best give Tomaselli's films a pass. As with Tomaselli's first feature, Desecration, Horror veers awfully close to pure surrealism; if you enjoy films like Un Chien Andalou or Eraserhead, you'll likely enjoy Horror. Not that Horror is in the same league. Although a better film than his first in almost every respect, Horror suffers from some weak acting and bad dialogue (though Lizzy Mahon and Kreskin do turn in solid performances). Also, Tomaselli has an unfortunate tendency to oversell his scares, occasionally resorting to overemphatic, in-your-face camerawork, and his busy, incessant, wailing-banshee soundtrack--which he obviously put a lot of work into-- tends to contribute to the problem. Less is almost always more in this genre, and a quieter, subtler approach would have been more effective.
All in all, Horror is a step up from the flawed but promising Desecration. For his next film, I'd love to see Tomaselli collaborate with a good screenwriter, someone who could help shape his ideas and provide strong dialogue and a better sense of character. He's not there yet, but Tomaselli just might be creeping toward greatness.",1054080000,,2226,5.270422535211267
1859896,4,B00008RUY6,"If you enjoyed ""Eraserhead"" and thus don't really have-to-know exactly what's going on at all times during a film... then you are in for a treat.  Tomaselli definitely has a style of his own (with only 2 films - that I am aware of) and even though constricted by a limited budget and actors that range from promising (Lizzy Mahon) to down-right bad (most of the rest) has created a truly fascinating dream-like entertainment... I honestly couldn't take my eyes off the screen right from the start!  A lot of very informative extras are included on this disc (Elite EE6666) with a Director's commentary that completly 'fills-in-the-holes' (story-wise) for those viewers that require such.  The 5.1 audio remix is also a definite plus for it enhances the experience greatly.
Now if only a smart Producer would give Mr. Tomaselli carte blanche to create the masterpiece that I know he is capable of... much like Alfredo Leone did for Mario Bava and ""Lisa and the Devil.""",1054080000,,967,4.848484848484849
1859937,5,B00008RUY6,"Dante Tomaselli truly outdid himself with Horror.  The strangely beautiful imagery is what makes his movies truly disturbing, and therefore truly effective.  I really think that this director is going places.

From what I understand, Dante is being considered for directing the new ""Halloween 9"".  I believe that a big-budget horror movie in the hands of Dante Tomaselli could easily wind up a classic of the genre.  There is a petition here: [...] that you can sign if you'd like to see that too.  If you love his movies so far, imagine what he could do with a big budget.",1141689600,,573,4.68
1859938,3,B00008RUY6,"[good things]

Some things that I liked about this movie was the locaion. The location reminded me alot of Children Of The Corn meets Wendigo. The story was good, it's too bad the acting comprimised the outcome of the movie. The directing was alright, but the story made no sense. Felissa Rose has a small appearance in the movie, that was one of me main reasons for buying this.

[the bad]

I understand this is a very low-budget production, but the actong was horrendous. It was very hard to endure the movie in some parts because of the acting. I also didn't dig the whole goat thing either, but all in all it worked out well. The lighted jack o' lantern heads didn't make much sense, and looked quite ridiculous. The blood and gore was also lacking, but keeping the budget in mind it was pretty satisfactory.

[final thoughts]

I originally bought this movie after hearing about director Dante Tomaselli's other production Satan's Playground and seeing that Felissa Rose made an appearance. After watching it I am not sure how much I liked this movie. Some parts were good, and others were painful to watch. I guess that is the risk you take with inexperienced actors. I wonder how many people bought this movie for Felissa as I did. Dante is a great genre fan, and he is bringing back old genre favorite actors and putting them in his movies (much like Scott Goldberg). I'd really suggest checking this out, who knows you may really dig it.",1136246400,,1445,4.607003891050583
1859939,4,B00008RUY6,"This is not your typical linear horror genre film, but it is not intended as such.  Tomaselli carefully crafts a disconcerting nightmarish vision.  Each frame is well thought out and visually captivating.  The pacing is fast and the acting, while not exactly captivating, is perfectly acceptable for this type of film.  The special features are also worth a look, with some intriguing behind-the-scenes footage and interviews regarding the legitimacy of the Amazing Kreskin's powers of suggestion, a look at Tomaselli's previous work ""Desecration"", and insightful commentary from Tomaselli that is consistently interesting and more insightful than most.

While it would be interesting to see what Tomaselli would do with a screenplay or story by someone else, his ideas and presentation distinguish him from the rest of the pack, and I look forward to his upcoming films, including his latest ""Satan's Playground"".

""Horror"" is not for everyone.  This film has much more in common with the works of directors like Bava, Argento, and especially Fulci, who's ""The Beyond"" this seems particular influenced by, rather than mainstream American horror films.  Tomaselli is more interested in creating atmosphere than telling a tale.  This may not be the scariest or most coherent movie that you've ever seen, but it is different and definitely worth a look to those whose tastes wander outside the mainstream.",1126656000,,1403,5.340909090909091
1859940,5,B00008RUY6,"Dante Tomaselli's ""HORROR"" is one of the most original pieces of artwork that I have ever seen! This is a perfect example of creativity,imagination & natural skill crushing any budget problems. ""HORROR"" is like a beautifully creepy painting come to life! Its very hard to explain. It is definetly one of those movies that you have to see for your self just like a FULCI,ARGENTO or a BAVA film!!!! I'm also very sick & tired of listening to mainstream conditioned so-called horror fans rant & rave about horror movies that don't make perfect sense! I mean whats your problem people? Does everything have to be spelled out in big black & white letters & sitting firmly inbetween the lines for you to enjoy it????! Can nothing be left unexplained? I mean (YOUR)god forbid if you have to read between the lines every once in a while or draw your own conclusions for a scene by useing your own imagination, OH YOUR LORDY LORD NOT THAT!! Forget you horror fan wannabe's! For people who actually enjoy GREAT original horror movies loaded with beautifully creepy atmosphere then this movie is right up your walk way. Dante Tomaselli is a definite breath of fresh air. I believe he is carrying along the legacy & traditional style of great italian horror maestro's that came before him along with his own original flavor & I am now a huge fan of this new maestro! I see nothing but great things coming in the future from this guy! This man did his horror home work & I have to completely disagree with the editorial reviewer! movies don't have to make perfect sense to be scary as hell & there also isn't a set way to make horror movies! horror movies can make all the sense in the world & still sukkk! As well as a horror movie can make no sense at all & still be a masterpiece like Dante Tomaselli's ""HORROR"". THIS IS WHAT NIGHTMARE'S ARE MADE OF!

1859944,4,B00008RUY6,"The second effort from independent filmmaker Dante Tomaselli, ""Horror"" blazes much of the same trail set forth with his first film ""Desecration"".  ""Horror"" is a non-stop assault of strange imagery, drugged-out hallucinations, unexplainable continuity jumps and zealous religious fanaticism.  Despite the obviously limited budget, ""Horror"" manages to raise some serious scares and contains some memorable scenes.
5 drug-addicted teenagers escape from a rehab clinic, steal a van and head on their way to the house of Salo, a psychotic preacher who visited them while they were locked up and offered promises of salvation.  On the drive to Salo's house, the youths indulge themselves in all the booze, marijuana and mushrooms that their hearts desire.  Upon arriving to Salo's house ""Luck"" the leader of the gang and most intoxicated of the group, stumbles into the house to find a young woman (Grace) being physically abused by what he sees as two demons. After shooting them both with his revolver, he discovers that he has in reality shot Salo and his wife, Grace's abusive parents.  Somehow, the killings trigger a supernatural force over the house and its surroundings.  The woods bordering the house are now filled with satanic symbolisms, trippy-looking trees with candy canes and Jack-O-lanterns attached to the branches and hordes of night-crawling ghouls.
It is noticeable right away that ""Horror"" is trying mightily hard to be a scary genre effort.  For the most part, it succeeds.  The woods bordering the house are filled with mist and fog and impending doom.  This is one of the best examples I've seen in a while of a movie that effectively employs the use of sound as a tactic to scare the viewer using such devices as creaking doors, insane female giggling and blowing wind.  And shooting the movie in the middle of winter amid heavy snow and blistering cold add to the feeling of dread.

Curiously enough, one of the things that failed to spook me was the goat itself.  On the DVD cover as the film's mascot and a species that has long been linked with Satanism, the goat appears in several scenes, usually as the terror factor is mounting.  But instead of being scary I found this goat, with its fluffy fur and ""who me"" look of innocence, to be kind of cute and cuddly-looking.  I'm quite certain that's not the effect the director was hoping for but that's how I took it.  And of course this being an indie low-budgeter, the acting is at times quite horrid.  Although Reverend Salo Sr. (played by ""The amazing Kreskin"") and the character of Grace (Lizzy Mahon) gave admirable performances, everyone else's acting left LOTS to be desired especially the woman who plays Marissa, one of the 5 escaped addicts.  To say that woman couldn't act her way out of a paperbag would be putting it kindly.
Despite the low-budget cheapness, I found ""Horror"" to be highly enjoyable and very creepy.  Dante Tomaselli is a stylistic director whose work conjures up flashes of Mario Bava and Dario Argento's classic Giallos.  I admire Tomaselli for playing it straight-up and going for scares instead of resorting to comedic gore or self-referential nonsense like so many horror movies that are manufactured for the masses.",1071878400,3,3223,4.968342644320298
1859945,4,B00008RUY6,"Having seen Dante Tomaselli's first feature film, Desecration, his latest, Horror, demonstrates that this up-and-coming filmmaker is perfecting his own style of filmmaking. While he does harken back to Italian horror maestros like Mario Bava and Dario Argento, the complex soundscapes Tomaselli creates for his movies are quite reminiscent of David Lynch's movies. And like John Carpenter, he also composes much of the soundtrack for his movies. This puts Tomaselli in good company indeed.
Horror is a creepy, waking nightmare a la Lost Highway where the protagonist is eternally damned. There are some truly striking images in Horror that linger in the brain long after the film ends. This is a truly unsettling, old school horror movie that is a breath of fresh air after the self-reflexive cycle of Scream films.
The DVD is packed with some nice extras. The real stand-out is the audio commentary by Tomaselli. He provides many fascinating insights into what inspires and influences him and unravels a bit of the ambiguity that the film creates.
Along with Larry Fessenden's Wendigo and the low budget Canadian werewolf film, Ginger Snaps, Tomaselli's Horror heralds a new wave of horror films that echo the no-holds-barred aesthetics of the '70s generation. Horror is definitely worth a look and remember the name Dante Tomaselli -- he's a filmmaker who's going places.",1058745600,10,1373,5.217194570135747
1859946,5,B00008RUY6,"Dante Tomaselli's ""Horror"" is a chilling portrait of five damned souls standing before Hell's open gates and gaping at the terrors that are stretched out before them.  Logic is swept in a flood of bizarre and frightening imagery (a sinister black goat, leering, demonic jack 'o lanterns, legions of the undead), leaving the viewer just as frightened and confused as the characters.  The film is a puzzle.  Those seeking an easy answer, or any answer for that matter, will be sorely disappointed.  Tomaselli exhibits great courage as a filmmaker in this age of happy endings and by-the-numbers scripts with easy to comprehend themes.  Those willing to take this hellish journey will find much to like, and be frightened by, in ""Horror.""  It is a scary little film that will get under your skin and haunt you long after it has ended.  See this film... if you dare!",1057881600,,862,4.8231292517006805

It is our job to figure out what is going on, what is real and what is a hallucination, and what is the chronological order of the scene in relation to the other scenes.

While attempting to figure things out, similar things happen such as the appearance of a goat and pizza melting faces in the mirror as well as zombies. I really don't see the appeal of this production unless you're sitting in the dorm at Christmas time with a few 'shrooms trying to kill some time with some brain dead individuals.

7986559,2,B00008RUY6,"I just watched Horror last night after buying it on Amazon for $7 and it was brand new, I generally had low expectations from the film with it having a 2.6 out of 10 on IMDB from 800 voters, it seemed like it was going to be terrible. Horror is Definitly a weird flick but I am actually into weird films such as Dreamcatcher and The Number 23 for example so that only interested me more. The plot concerns drug addicts who have recently escaped from a rehabilitation center having just killed one guard to get out, the leader of the group Luck has snatched up a bag of drugs and candy given by Reverand Salo Jr. who told Luck that after escaping could hide out at his secluded home, there demonic stuff happens. The movie never makes any sense even though I think I understand the ending just slightly. The kills are nothing special and the acting is absolutely terrible and when I say terrible...I mean terrible. On the other hand, The visuals and atmosphere are amazing and creepy as hell.

Overall, Horror does pull together some really good scenes such as any scenes with the demonic goat and the painting scene which I thought was really creepy but horrible acting and poor directing bring the film down majorly and it could never fully recover in its hour and thirteen minutes that is if you don't count credits.

I kinda forgot about this movie till I cam across it while looking for dvds to add to my Netflix queue. I had no idea someone would actually put money inot releasing this piece of shitaki mushrooms onto DVD! ""A living nightmare in Hell caught on film"" -Cult Cuts Magazine. The real quote should be ""A living nightmare in Hell is having to watch this movie!"" Don't get me wrong, when I saw this movie at age 14 at a horror movie marathon in Columbus, OH (which featured guest Bruce ""Don't call me Ash"" Campbell! WOOT!) I laughed my head off more than I had in probably a long time at that time. But the fact is, this movie is 1 star quality, but 3 stars worthy in terms of being good for a laugh. But don't watch it alone, this is a movie that you need to watch a la Mystery Science Theater 3000 style with some friends. I lucked out having an entire theater to laugh along with.

Even if I had watched it recently I couldn't give a proper plot description because there's barely a plot to be had. Oh sure some kids escape a drug rehab clinic and there's some old man who's a religious nut, and a demon goat. The special effects guy was at the marathon and he said that they used a goat becuase they couldn't get a spider (how you go from goat to spider I have no idea) and towards the end of his speech I personally yelled at ""NEVER SHOW THIS MOVIE TO ANYONE!"" Later in the lobby some kid who was a couple years younger asked if I had ever made a movie or knew what went into making one and of course I said no; and he responded with how can I judge it. Of course I responded with ""Are you $#!++ing me?"" And while in my life so far I've only made two short films, I've also watched many many MANY making of features on DVD's so I do have a good idea what goes into making a movie. Some of my reviews on here poking fun of the more artsy films has made people comment that I should stick with Jackie Chan movies or something I guess not much of a thinking movie.

I love plenty of crazy and or artsy and or avant-garde movies. But that's if there is a real point to it, not just because is doing it to appear that way. The image of a the man with the goat head is crazy for sure, but it's not enough to sustain the film really. It's not a long movie i recall, but it feels longer than it should be because it is terribly slow. It's never a good sign when the movie starts off with every single credit appears before the movie. Some could argue that's because it's a throwback to older films, which is cool, but it seems more like it's because the editor knows that nobody is gonna wanna watch the end credits so they might as well get that over. There's a scene where a kid's face turns blue and I suppose that's because he's detoxing, hard to say. The special effects aren't bad, but at times they are just so random and stupid and don't fit in with the movie. The main kid will start making out with his girlfriend and then start to puke blood (seems to be a bit pre mature if you ask me). The audience was literally freaking out when they saw that the movie wasn't quite over after it faded to black and faded back in. Tahnkfully it was just a preview for his next movie or something.

Their minds create a hallucinatory nightmare that drives them to murder and madness as they attempt to escape from their own personal hells. HORROR adheres to a surreal dream-logic, where scenes bleed into one another and dreams blur into reality without ever distinguishing between the two. Director Dante Tomaselli focuses entirely on creating a frightening aesthetic, atmosphere, and mood, rather than establishing a linear story structure. Backlighting, fog effects, color filters, high- and low-angle shooting, each of these techniques are combined to heighten the constant state of unease and terror. HORROR also introduces a number of truly disturbing images that are accompanied by an unsettling score. The performances by the untrained cast are also forgivable given the size of the picture and the minimal dialog. Tomaselli comes through with this twisted vision of hell from the same vein of Horror as the works of Jim Ven Bebber.

I was quite fond of Tomaselli's first feature, 1999's Desecration, though judging by its IMDB rating I was one of the few. In any case, when I had a chance to see his second movie, Horror, I jumped. Once again I'm in the minority; while I laughed at the jack-o-lantern demons just as much as everyone else did (and no, they're not supposed to be funny), I found the movie quite watchable, and not nearly as confusing as everyone else seems to have. (Here's a hint: look at the final scene as a well-worn horror movie trope, though to tell you which one would spoil the entire film.)

The plot: Revered Salo, Jr. (Vincent Lamberti, who previously worked with Tomaselli on Desecration), visits a drug rehab facility to spread the good word. He also spreads some goods of the more illicit variety, while telling certain of the patients to come see him when they get out. (This all happens before the opening scenes.) When we open, a number of those patients, high on said goods, have decided to take him up on his offer by breaking out, stealing a van, and heading for the good father's farm. When they get there, however, they find out that perhaps the good Reverend may not have had their best interests at heart. The preacher's family is, shall we say, a little off. And what's up with that goat running around all over the place? The only halfway normal one of the bunch is Grace (In and Out's Lizzy McMahon), who may or may not be Salo Jr.'s daughter, but she's been messed up with years of brainwashing by her insane father. Her grandfather (played by the Amazing Kreskin-- yes, really)is the only stabilizing force in her life, but he's not exactly a rock in this ocean of chaos. Yes, this is one messed-up family, and it's about to get even more so with the advent of five tripping teens. And a pair of jack-o-lantern demons that were probably bought at the local discount store.

Even the movie's harshest critics have admitted that the film is a visual delight, and that is certainly the case. Tomaselli, younger cousin of Alice, Sweet Alice director Alfred Sole, learned his trade from a man who directed very few films, but always brought his A game when he did. Tomaselli is no different in that regard visually, as both Desecration and Horror show. Yeah, some of the special effects are about as cheesy as they come (do I mention the jack-o-lantern demons again? It seems I must), but they're at least well-framed. Tomaselli knows his way around a camera, that's for sure, as does cinematographer Tim Naylor (who would team with Tomaselli again three years later for Satan's Playground).

As for the negative charges often aimed at the film, yes, some of the acting is less than perfect. Most of these actors had never been in front of a camera before, and the amateurism does show, but then, as with Desecration, you're looking at a film that had essentially no budget; do you really expect DeNiro and Pacino? Many have also dismissed the plot as nonexistent or far too confusing. Granted, the movie does take some paying attention to really get what's going on, but I didn't find it all that hard (and I watched it while playing poker, as I do with many movies these days, so I wasn't paying complete attention myself and I still kept up with it with no problem). I think that may say more about the reviewers and their lack of exposure to microbudget horror films than it does about Tomaselli's movie. The same criticisms were levelled at Desecration, and I found them equally spurious there.

Overall, I found it enjoyable. Your mileage may, and probably will, vary, but approach all reviews of the film--including this one--with as much salt as necessary. ***",1227052800,,3707,4.653435114503817
7986564,5,B00008RUY6,"HORROR is meant to be disjointed, disorienting, and disturbing. It achieves all three objectives. Like any nightmare, things jump around in time and space, or mutate into something completely different. Being off kilter is a big part of the fun! The imagery (that devilish goat, the jack-o-lanterns, etc.) is all part of Dante Tommaselli's bad dream / funhouse approach to horror film-making. It's said that H.P. Lovecraft wrote his stories based on his own nightmares. I believe Tomaselli does the same. The main character, Grace Salo (Lizzy Mahon) is doomed to roam this terror-scape, at the mercy of forces unspeakable. Her mother (Christie Sanford) and father (Vincent Lamberti) are depraved demons in human form. They keep Grace doped up w/ injections so they can carry on with their kidnapping and God knows what else. A group of rehab escapees -(high on alcohol, pot, and mushrooms)- stumbles right into the middle of this insanity. They've been invited to the Salo place for a little party. Due to the combination of drugs, a constant dream-state, and the forces of evil, the story twists around like a non-linear pretzel. In dreams (as well as in hell) time and space don't really matter. HORROR only makes sense to me if I accept it on it's own maniacal terms. There are plenty of great horror movies w/ perfect chronological order. This isn't one of them! This is a mindf***, designed to leave a dark impression in our minds. That's what I like about it...",1204156800,,1467,4.895582329317269
7986565,3,B00008RUY6,"LOL. Anyway, this is my first film by Donte Tomeselli, and I'm not really interested in his other films after seeing this. I liked the dreamlike, surreal quality of the story, but it somehow didn't live up to all the hype it generated. I guess I was just expecting more. It's not an awful movie, but not amazing or original either...just ok and some parts were pretty freaky (i.e. under the bed and that goat *shudders*).",1185408000,,421,4.552631578947368
7986566,4,B00008RUY6,"....chances are this one'll blow your skirt up.  The look and feel of the film are very similar to early Argento (Inferno ex ).  Stunning, disturbing visuals that make no sence.  Surreal artsy-fartsy.  And very effective at that. The first time you watch ""Horror"" you will probably be left scratching you head with a wtf?! feeling.  But, the haunting imagery and slow-burn sence of dread will stay with you long after the credits roll.  It's like you've been given a window into someone else's subconscious and are witnessing a fevered nightmare play out infront of you.  Not you traditional b-movie fare, yet definately worth a look for those with a love of all things weird and wonderful.  It's not perfect.  But I can see what the film makers where going for and appreciate their effort.  My advice; rent before you buy.",1174176000,,823,4.773049645390071
