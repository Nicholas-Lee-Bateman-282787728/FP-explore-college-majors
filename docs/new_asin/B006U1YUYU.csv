5018917,5,B006U1YUYU,"I am a fan of indie movies and low budget movies, and I liked this movie. Most major actors in most majors movies act like actors, not real people. However, in this movie, because the actors are young and many are first time actors, they act like real people, which gives an almost documentary feel to the movie. They talk and interact like people I've known, with all their vulnerabilities. The plot kept me interested throughout the movie; i needed to know what happens next. One thing i can say about the 'props' in the movie is that they looked extremely real. i have no doubt that they were real.
However, if you are offended by the sale and consumption of drugs (marijuana and cocaine) which permeates through the film, then this movie is not your cup of tea. If you are not into low budget indies, then this isn't for you.
I've watched many movies and given up after the first five or ten minutes, but i enjoyed watching Five Pounds from beginning to end.",1478304000,,962,4.471590909090909

5018919,1,B006U1YUYU,Bad. Bad. Bad. Inexperienced high school actors at best. Slow direction and amateur editing. Even for no charge this movie is overpriced. Don't waste your time.,1477699200,,160,5.1923076923076925

8504358,4,B006U1YUYU,"For an ultra low budget thing this was a nice piece of work,.This had cool cinematography, cool soundtrack, i think there was some cool scoring here and there too, and acting way better than chris pratt or J-lo. I mean it might not be the coolest movie but for what it was, it was effective and had continuity and it was just a good piece of work for sure, and was kind of cool.",1520640000,,378,4.121621621621622
8504359,5,B006U1YUYU,"I love this movie. It kind of reminds me of Pineapple Express & Half Baked, but it just has it's own potential. You guys did a great job. Keep up the great work. :-)",1515110400,,165,3.8823529411764706

8504364,3,B006U1YUYU,"The movie is watchable only if you're stoned. The direction is terrible, it looks like it was filmed on a cell phone. But Alec Burns is fabulous, it seemed like he was carrying the entire movie. I would love to see more of him. He reminded me of a young Jack Nicholson.",1494374400,,269,4.1923076923076925
