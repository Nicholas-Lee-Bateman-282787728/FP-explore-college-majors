8528083,1,B008H6GHUQ,"Starting with episode two this series has some of the worst audio mixing and design. Those episodes overlay the narration with annoying, loud music and overdone foley especially in the introduction. This series was produced by a Canadian which perhaps explains why apparently undue credit was given to a Scotsman for invention of the television. He used advances made by others to come out with a mechanical television system that was not successful. So who was the true Father of Television? This ubiquitous invention, like many others, had many people contributing to its creation. It's obvious, however, that much of the credit for making electronic television should probably go to Philo Farnsworth. Court after court hearing Farnsworth v. Zworykin acknowledge that his ideas found their way into the first commercial systems built by RCA.",1520726400,,843,5.298507462686567

8528085,3,B008H6GHUQ,"Inventions 101 for the 20th century. This set is a great starter set which does a nice overview of a number of great inventions of the 20th century, from 1900-1999. However, the overviews are done only in 10-15 minutes per invention increments, and many inventions covered are not the ""better"" inventions, Instead, they should have done overviews of inventions only mentioned in passing, such as the Ford Model T, an invention that I am sure you would agree, deserves a thorough overview,  All in all, this is a nice set for a quick overview which can lead to further study, and the cost of the set makes it worthwhile.",1470700800,,619,4.678899082568807
