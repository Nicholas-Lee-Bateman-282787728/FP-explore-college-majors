8375021,3,B002NF7NLE,"I don't see why anyone would release a DVD with so little video on it.  This disc contains what looks like two episodes of Thor spliced together and one episode of the 1967 animated Spiderman series.  This must have been a limited edition release to be selling in the $35-50 range.

In my view, the price isn't worth it.  If you're into cheesy 1960s cartoons with primitive animation, you'll probably enjoy this DVD more than I did.

Some 1940s animation (like Fleischer's Superman), was much better quality than superhero animation of the 1960s.  Would someone please explain this to me?  How did animation quality slide so far downhill in the years between?  I don't get it.",1355184000,,676,4.767241379310345
