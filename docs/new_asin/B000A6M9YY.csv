8074935,5,B000A6M9YY,I'm as much a fashion maven as I am a sewists and for both this is a great series.  Watching the ladies work in the atelier is so charmingly delightful and of course seeing the product of their labors is exquisite.  The lovely lady who weaves/makes the trims is equally charming.  It explains why the whole garment at Chanel is so treasured!,1487894400,,341,4.467741935483871
8074936,5,B000A6M9YY,"This DVD is a must for fashion mavens out there. You really get to see a the behind the scenes inner workings of The House Of Chanel. One of the highlights of this documentary is that you get to see how Chanel trim is made. It is in French, and it is a region 2 DVD, so just invest in a region free DVD player. It's worth it.",1392681600,2,325,3.7941176470588234
