8424497,5,B004D07DPS,"It's a pretty good DVD! Not filled with extras, but the price was good for the 8 DVD. And finally I could enjoy my childhood favorite sitcom. The picture quality is not as good as you expect it in 2011, but much better than the VHS recorded pirated versions you can find on the internet. I say it's worth buying!",1299456000,,312,4.216666666666667
