8603626,3,B0006U5V6M,"Not a fan of Tagalog (Filipino Language) movies but I actually enjoyed watching this movie. Great performance between Aga and Kristine... I enjoyed viewing the places they went on this cruise. Purchased movie came in a box type case w/ 2 disc. 2nd disc has extras and music video of Gary Valenciano ""How Did You Know"". The English Subtitles included in this movie helped out a lot since there are some words not in my vocabulary. Recommend to all looking for a great love story... However, ISBN on my DVD is 1775070832019.",1111622400,,522,4.684782608695652
