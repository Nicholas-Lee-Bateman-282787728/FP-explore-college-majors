1077867,5,6305812721,This movie gives meaning to my otherwise meaningless life.  The actors are worthy of emmys and the director is my new hero.  Everyone will watch this movie or answer to me.  Then they will go and rent camp blood 2.  They are both the best movies I have ever seen.  Anyone who doesn't like this movie shouldn't be allowed to live in this fine country.,1027209600,4,350,4.323076923076923

1077872,4,6305812721,"This movie is so much fun to watch with its poor cuts, mediocore acting, and music that sounds like it was taken from Resident Evil. This is definitley very entertaining and very enjoyable. If you want a horror movie to laugh at, ""Camp Blood"" is one of your best bets.",970358400,,268,4.38
7895284,3,6305812721,"This film opens with what looks to be a goofy early 30s couple shooting a documentary in the backwoods of Camp Blackwood they're exploring when suddenly they decide to get it on with each other right there in the middle of the woods (you already know where this is going). They're interrupted when the girlfriend hears the sound of a rare bird she was looking for. They set out to look for it but are brutally killed by a person in a clown mask with a machete.

The story then jumps ahead to 4 young people/2 couples: Tricia and Steven & Jason and Nicole, all of whom look to be in their early 20s, preparing to go camping in Camp Blackwood for the weekend. As they draw close near Camp Blackwood's opening, they encounter a madman named Bromley Thatcher who warns the group that the camping ground is now called Camp Blood due to the fact that a psychotic killer roams the woods there and advises to them to turn around and drive back home. They don't listen and advance through anyway.",1451433600,,987,4.423076923076923

7895286,2,6305812721,"It lacks a good story but all in all it was well put together. I know there is a lot of hate towards this movie but for such a low budget I thought it was superbly done! I have no idea why people have to be so hard on this movie.... put the directors in your shoes... it must have been as back-breaking and complex to make as ""The Evil Dead (1981)"" was! My main concern for this movie is how many movies it rips off!

Plot: four friends and a guide go for a little adventure in the quiet solitude that the dense thick woods of Camp Blackwood (A.K.A. Camp ""Blood"") provides even though they heard of a missing girl in the same area and they were flat-out warned about it and told not to go. But as they settle in for a night's rest they hear screams in which they also ignore but come to find out that there guide has been barbecued in there illogical fire that can engulf in flames by just throwing a match in it! Now the four friends are being stalked by a lunatic and are being picked off one by one.... who can survive the long day of the Camp Blood nightmare!

Review: As I said earlier this film rips off many movies mainly being ""Friday the 13th Part One"" and it even has ghost tales around a camp fire about there being a lunatic in the area just like in ""Friday the 13th Part Two""! Another film that really inspired the ending scene for this movie was ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre""! It really copied a lot from that ending as seen the killer slices at the girls back with a weapon and the ""SPOILER ALERET"" killer is hit by a truck and there are two killers that chase after her in the end ""END SPOILER""! And what is with the extended nudity scene that inquires no actual sex but just her looking all seductive towards a man that clearly is as dumb as they come! This film was well put together which I had mentioned earlier and it was. But it doesn't make it superbly excellent! It only gives it a little under decent score in my book. This film will be forgotten in 10 more years more than it has already been and that is a crying shame but for films like ""Avatar"" that will be remembered because of how cool it looked but in my opinion I thought it was stupid! To end this on a good note I will say that although it was on a micro-budget it still did what it set out to do and that is give us something cheesy and entertaining!

Acting: The screaming girl played by Jennifer Ritchkoff (and yes I had to look that up because this and Camp Blood 2 were pretty much the only real movies she played in and that makes her not well known) is wicked annoying but she does show how much she is into acting and I can appreciate that... the other actor I'd like to point out is Tim Young (Whom also acted in Scarecrow ""2002"") who plays Jay the fowl-mouth jerk that his girlfriend (who is played by Betheny Zolt) pretty much only puts up with it because he has money! I wish more was put into this not just acting wise but script wise as well!

Gore: a gory impalement with a machete, a body with cheap bloody cuts all over it, a really weak and fake decapitation, a machete sliced into ones head, a bloody eye gouging (but after the eye gouging the eyeballs seem to be intact just with the eyelids shut), some stabbings, and little more! It looked unreal but hey at least they had money for blood and gore!

Bottom Line: Director Brad Sykes is a great director and therefore I give him the upmost respect... I do believe that each camp blood movie was better than the one before it and for that I give him even more applause because he directed all three of them! The film wasn't that great or even decent but it was watchable and entertaining/funny and that is hard to do with a script that looks bad and sounds bad. It seemed like Mr. Sykes didn't like where it was going so he added a little humor to help boost the film along! In the end it was a little under decent!

Suggested MPAA: Rated: R for strong violence, language, sexual content, and some nudity

Besides, the anaglyph version doesn't work at all. The images aren't assembeled well. It's a waste of time unless you can find an original disc.

7895288,3,6305812721,"For a movie with a budget this low, it was actually very impressive. It looked like a group of friends went camping for the weekend, got sauced, and came up with this idea for a movie. It was good in a really funny/retarded way. I think that I write stories that have a better storyline than this.
Now the acting, it wasn't that too bad, but it was bad. I did not know that the person who was the killer would end up being it, but I did know that the helper person had something to do with the killings, and I think that it had a twist-kind of-in the end.
If you  like movies that are suppose to be scary, but are acutually funny as hell,and movies that look like they were made on a maximum $1,000 budget, check this movie out,, but if you like movies that actually look like they took more than a week to make, stay the hell away from this. In my view. I liked this movie, but I don't have the same opinion as a lot of people.",1209600000,2,928,4.0162162162162165
7895289,5,6305812721,"i honestly can't remember the last time i laughed this hard at a movie.

people are looking way to far into this, but in reality, if you can't laugh at this you don't have a sense of humor. it is right up there with return of the living dead.",1138406400,2,242,3.938775510204082
7895290,3,6305812721,"Let's see a group of campers go to a place called 'Camp Blood', but they are warned not to go by a crazy old man on the side of the road. They end up facing a homicidal maniac who kills them with a machette. Do you think they might have lifted this from 'Friday the 13th'? Well there you go for a plot.

The blond birdwatcher who gets killed in the beginning is the hottest chick in the film, she's also the only one with a topless scene and she looks real good. The other girl that sparins her ankle is cute, but she keeps her clothes on, as does the overweight girl with the huge chest. Harris the guide is pretty butch, but she also keeps her clothes on. So if you're looking for T&A, it's over before the opening credits.

The acting isn't that bad. Except for the rich kid with the cell-phone. He's pretty hammy and lays on the schlock pretty thick.

Spoiler ahead be warned.....

This is pretty stupid because HArris is the first to die. She's hacked up and burned when the campers discover her in the morning. They are killed one by one until the overweight chick with the short haircut runs down the killer in a truck. It turned out to be Harris the guide. Yeah right, OK.

The end of ther flick has the survivor in an insane asylum and all her friends arrive as a doctor, cop, and a nurse. The last scene is the clown approaching with the machette.

This is a pretty stupid movie. Not much more can be said.",1104796800,4,1416,4.206642066420664
7895291,1,6305812721,"I rarely have problems watching a shot on video production. I figure budding new filmmakers have to start somewhere in the quest for a Hollywood career. If that means picking up Mom and Dad's camcorder and shooting a film with your buddies, so be it. It's not like you can walk into a Tinseltown studio with a script tucked under your arm and get a job making a summer blockbuster by the end of the week. Making films is a lot like writing; it takes a great amount of time and effort to create something other people will want to experience. I have seen plenty of movies where the director had almost nothing to work with yet created a truly engaging picture. Look at David Cronenberg's ""Shivers,"" for example. He had so little money that he couldn't film anywhere other than in an apartment building, yet the movie works nicely because the idea is original. Unfortunately, ""Camp Blood"" is an example of the other extreme, a prime example of sloppy filmmaking, bad acting, and a horrible and highly derivative script. ""Camp Blood"" looks bad, feels bad, and is bad. I find it incredible that you can rent this atrocity at the video store.
A group of young people (sigh) decides to camp out in the woods near an abandoned summer camp that the locals in the area have since rechristened Camp Blood. We know the place is dangerous because a couple looking for rare flora and fauna die horribly at the hands of killer clown (!) before the kiddies get there, and the locals tell our hapless heroes not to go there. Well, one local tells them, a guy dutifully fulfilling the clich ridden Crazy Ralph role seen in the early ""Friday the 13th"" films. As the campers arrive on the scene-two guys and two girls-they meet up with their ""guide,"" a tough looking chick with a sinister attitude who seems to know more about Camp Blood than she is willing to let on. The gang tramps out into the woods, sets up a few tents, and promptly falls prey to a guy shuffling around in the woods wearing a cheesy clown mask. Everyone expires except one of the girls, a portly young lady whose screams of terror must rank as the funniest expressions of terror ever recorded on celluloid...oops, I mean videotape. The ""twist"" ending is so incredibly thickheaded that I felt not only robbed of the few cents I spent renting this clunker, but actually considered shelling out a few more bucks to hire a private detective to track down everyone associated with the film so I could personally tell them what I thought about the movie.
I didn't bother watching ""Camp Blood"" in its 3-D format since I don't have the necessary eyewear. Doing so wouldn't have made much of a difference anyway. The movie reeks, period. Everything you could imagine going wrong with a movie happens here. The acting, for example, is downright awful. One of the guys on the trip is such a mouthy jerk that watching his performance is the equivalent of dragging daggers over a chalkboard. He's always yelling at the top of his lungs, swearing at somebody, or threatening to harm his friends. Never mind the fact that he's a skinny little runt who would drop like a stone at the first punch. The second place award in the ""most irritating"" category is the heroine of the film, a whiny gal who constantly berates her friends about the trip. She also takes center stage in the lamest scene in the film, the all-important chase at the end between her and the killer. I've seen people with walkers move faster than these two. And she wails away like a siren the whole time. Even worse, the actors reappear at the end playing entirely different roles without any explanation.
As for the special effects, cinematography, and pacing-forget about it. A bit of blood shows up from time to time, but not enough or done well enough to get fired up about. The cinematography, strictly home movie camcorder all the way, looks like a three year old planned it. The pacing slows down to a snail's pace within seconds of the opening credits. I think the movie only ended up running for roughly seventy plus minutes, but it felt like I could have read ""War and Peace,"" ""Moby Dick,"" and ""The Count of Monte Christo"" in the time it took to watch the picture. I have already said it, but it bears repeating-nothing about ""Camp Blood"" works. The only mystery in this movie has little to do with the killer's identity but everything to do with how I could sit still long enough to watch this car wreck from start to finish. I am not strongly urging you to avoid this film; I am ordering you not to watch it. Just keep moving right along when you see the case on the shelf at the video store.
The DVD contains a few extras, mostly trailers for a couple of other schlock shot on video films like ""Hunting Season"" and a zombie picture. I got the impression from the trailers that the same people behind ""Camp Blood"" had a lot to do with these two films. If so, I know I won't watch them anytime soon. Why? Life lasts only so long, and there are other things I could do with my time. Like cleaning my navel, organizing my sock drawer, and polishing the plastic tips on my shoelaces. I guess we should give it up for ""Camp Blood"" in the end, though. By making such an atrocious film, every other film now has a standard against which they can judge their own innate badness (or goodness). Give this one a wide, wide berth.",1081987200,5,5338,4.515495867768595
7895292,4,6305812721,"Wow! What can I say about this movie? I fell in love with it after just 1 viewing. I saw it in a video store shortly after The Blair Witch Project hit the theaters and rented it. It is independently-made so the camera work isn't spectacular, but the special effects make up for that! The characters and dialogue are believable, and the action is intense and scary. A must-see for all horror movie fans!! Needless to say, I own this and the sequel.",1059264000,4,447,4.397590361445783
