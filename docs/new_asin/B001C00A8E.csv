3503358,5,B001C00A8E,"We purchased this collection for the Fat Albert Christmas special alone. What a nice surprise to find 2 more Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids episodes, a full length Casper Christmas movie, along with the Christmas Gumby & Pokey there are several holiday episodes including Thanksgiving, and George of the Jungle includes a few more other than his Christmas episode.. Memories of childhood aside, this item is well worth the price. The transfer to dvd is clean and clear, and the audio is nice. Even the menus are user friendly and not complicated. Children and adults alike will enjoy this collection.",1292198400,,599,4.9405940594059405

This set of cartoons is a lot of fun to watch. As an adult, it brings back a lot of memories from my childhood. When you put the discs in, the menus feel very old school, no problems with functionality, just not the slick menu systems that new DVDs have.",1286064000,16,814,4.625
3503360,5,B001C00A8E,"Boy, talk about old school packaging.  It is a large clamshell package that looks like it could hold at least 6 discs, but for 2 discs.  I was a bit nervous as I never heard of the company that put this out, but quality seems to be quite good.  They even throw in bonus episodes which is a nice surprise especially since they do not show them on the packaging nor is there any paperwork at all included.  Very plain and more generic than I was hoping for as it'd been nice to read a description of the shows and tell a little about each one.  Other than that, Very good quality and cool to see these shows.",1261612800,5,606,4.101694915254237

8285399,1,B001C00A8E,"Why are these shows placed together in a compilation...? They were all decades apart and none (except maybe fat Albert) could even remotely be considered a classic/a favorite?

8285404,4,B001C00A8E,"My 8 year old kept asking why we didn't have any Cmas movies (other than Elf which is the best of all time!) so I decided to get a few to bring out each year and enjoy. This disc was a great price and instead of just one, I got 4 movies! My children loved them! It was nice sharing with them some of the past characters from when I was a child! I would recommend this for others wanting those special movies that you take out just once a year and then pack away with your decorations in order to enjoy them each and every holiday season! :)",1395532800,2,540,3.963302752293578
