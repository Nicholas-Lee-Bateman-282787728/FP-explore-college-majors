8356223,5,B0028H8ESI,"I bought this 'cause I love the book it's based on (""Perfect Skin"" by Nick Earls). This movie is about skin only in the metaphorical sense. It's about a young man and his baby daughter. He is pealing away the layers of protection around his heart that are stopping him from ""moving on"". Although there is a little love story, I wouldn't really call this a romance. Although there is plenty of comedy and some romance in the story, it isn't really a RomCom either. It's just a story, and a good one. This movie is missing a few of my favourite bits from the book but nonetheless, I loved it. I can't speak Italian, so I relied on the subtitles, and still it was fantastic. In some senses, my inability to understand the language made me focus on the acting more than usual. All the main actors do a fantastic job and I was totally convinced by the main actor and his relationship with the baby. The movie is delivered in a down-to-earth style, including a couple of touching scenes that might produce tears from the more tenderhearted watchers, but for the most part it is warm and amusing. There are a couple of extremely funny scenes are necessarily delivered with almost farcical style (which suits). My husband has watched this movie, loved it, and rewatched it more times even than me!! This is a real keeper. It's a shame it's not available for region 1. It's worth investing in a region-free DVD player just so that you can watch this movie.",1312243200,2,1447,4.505703422053232
