8032745,5,B0002VEP8U,"This was a wonderful little DVD.  We used almost all of the ideas on the DVD for my daughter's first sleepover.  It was a huge hit with all of the tweens at her party.  It's really not something I would use over and over, but for a first-time party idea, it was great, worth every penny I paid for it!!",1303776000,,302,4.0
8032746,5,B0002VEP8U,"Not only did my six-year old daughter love this movie (she won't stop watching it), but my eight-year old son enjoys it too.  My daughter loves the actresses, who are very good, and now she wants to do all of the activities in the movie.  I've started giving it out as a gift to my daughter's friends and they all seem to love it too.  Highly recommended.",1076457600,2,355,4.268656716417911
