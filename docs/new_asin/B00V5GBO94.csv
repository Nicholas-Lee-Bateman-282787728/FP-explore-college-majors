People who persevere through the extensive dialogue will enjoy the different important spiritual lessons covered in this story. All the actors were good but you, Royce (Jackson), were exceptional and ""real"" in your portrayal. Thanks for asking for my opinion.",1436400000,,370,5.396551724137931
8709279,5,B00V5GBO94,"""Best Friends Eternally"" - let me begin this review by saying the plot of the movie was GREAT - very interesting and  enjoyable! The actors and actresses played their parts very well. After viewing the movie I can truly say that I was pleased with the resolution of the various issues presented during the film.

I was so impressed with the part of  ""Jackson"" - knowing Royce Henry as a Man of God - and as a Best Friend for over 10 years - I was wondering how he could portray an atheist. Very well done Royce. Every actor and actress was very good in their roles - they each portrayed them so well - it was easy to stay interested in the story.

I liked the message presented in the film. I thought the story was very well written by Donald James Parker.

Thank You Mr. Parker for writing and producing Christian films - I will be eagerly anticipating the next chapter in your ""Best Friends"" series.

God Bless!

8709280,3,B00V5GBO94,"I have just watched this film, I loved the music at the beginning....I enjoyed the story line very much...Royce Henry did an excellent job, his part was believable and at times humorous and even heart wrenching.  I cried when he gave his heart to the Lord and when he talked about his and Tony's experience in Viet Nam.  I did feel there were some negatives in the film...too many religious issues dealt with that did not relate to the film causing the film not to flow but seem disconnected at times. The issues distracted from the real message of the film and maybe should have been saved for a documentary film.  Beyond all that Jackson's salvation, Tony's fall from grace and his renewal was a great story line.....loved it.....",1428969600,,732,4.658914728682171
8709281,5,B00V5GBO94,"Donald James Parker has written another masterpiece! Best Friends Eternally starring Donald and Royce Henry as two veteran friends who have bonded over experience serving in Vietnam War and a game of chess serves as a must see for every individual, family, community, and especially churches abroad!  The many messages I walked away with were those pertaining to what a true friendship means and is, character, challenges, grace, mercy, and redemption along with so many more about discipleship and engaging the church, sinner, and saint in the process of discipleship. I watched very engaged as the granddaughter come to stay with Donald  while attending college and how her witness for Jesus led several to the Lord including Donald's friend Royce who was an atheist. The generations to come will also be empowered by this message. Every youth Pastor would benefit from showing this movie to their youth ministries. I am blown away by the humbleness depicted on screen as well as the down to earth realness in the whole script. I was blessed and this means I will  be honored to rite this review and several  others where needed to help in getting the message out; Jesus Saves!!"" Thank You Donald and Royce, humbly. It is my pleasure to share how two veterans changed their world around them and had their own lives changed in the process of transformation inside and out! Sincerely, Dolores E.

8709282,5,B00V5GBO94,"This is really a good movie and one that I recommend. A christian movie about two friends that have been friends along time. One knows Christ and is very concerned his friend Jackson, doesn't. I won't give the movie away. Watch it! You will enjoy every second of it.",1427760000,,266,4.448979591836735
