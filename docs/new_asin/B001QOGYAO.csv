3766318,3,B001QOGYAO,"The great disappointment of Peter Jackson's ""The Lovely Bones"" isn't that it's so unpleasant, but that it tackles unpleasantness in a way that, for the most part, isn't compelling. It tells the story of Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan), a murdered teenage girl whose spirit wanders in a kind of emotional purgatory, and even in death, she's angry at her killer and desperate for her family to move forward; while the idea is indeed a powerful one, the structure of the film is so disjointed and psychologically confusing that it's difficult for the idea to completely sink in. This is a well intentioned story, and there were individual moments I thought were handled nicely. But on the whole, it falls short, lacking focus, precision, and the right balance between plot, spectacle, mystery, and heavy-handed drama.

As the spirit of Susie wanders through a spectacular dreamscape of vast oceans, immense mountains, and sprawling fields, she periodically interjects with voiceover narrations, which not only diminish the power of interpretation, but also are so shamelessly poetic, mature, and philosophically profound that they really just belabor the point. If there's anything we learned from Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner,"" it's to trust that the audience will understand what's going on without the aid of droning verbal explanations. I'm well aware that Alice Sebold's original novel was written in the first person, but must I remind you that books are not movies and movies are not books? When a story is finally given the visual treatment, when the words on the page are reinterpreted for the big screen, long stretches of expository dialogue are simply not necessary.

Neither the novel nor the film made any secret of the identity of Susie's killer; we know right off the bat that it was her neighbor, George Harvey (Stanley Tucci). It's much easier to believe in this character when he's alone in his house, methodically toiling away on finely detailed dollhouses and precise scale drawings for underground hideaways, ones that will eventually be made from branches, wood, and earth. He's isolated, addicted to routine, and always scheming - a man obsessed. When he's in the presence of other people, however, he isn't even remotely convincing as the man no one would suspect of being a serial killer. Not once does he seem like a ""normal"" neighbor, not even when the police are interrogating him in his living room.

Caught in the middle of this tragedy is Susie's family, who for months endure painful uncertainties. Her father, Jack (Mark Wahlberg), is especially hard hit, eventually becoming so obsessed with discovering the truth that he drives away his long suffering wife, Abigail (Rachel Weisz). Of all the things ""The Lovely Bones"" gets wrong, it's portrayal of the Salmon family is just about right, Jackson apparently understanding that everyone mourns in their own way and that some have a harder time of it than others. The only exception to this is Susie's grandmother, Lynn (Susan Sarandon), who I never once believed was capable of bringing stability back into the Salmon home; she's a hard-drinking, chain-smoking, wise-cracking hurricane of a woman so stylistically out of place that it's impossible to accept her.

Other characters, most notably Susie's would-be love interest (Reece Ritchie) and misunderstood former classmate (Carolyn Dando), are adequately played but serve no real purpose other than to provide Susie with another outlet for wordy narrations. Even Len Fenerman, the detective assigned to investigate Susie's disappearance (Michael Imperioli), isn't given much to do except generate tension within the Salmon family for failing to find leads. I was, however, taken with Susie's sister, Lindsay (Rose McIver), a strong-willed, independent young woman who goes the lengths others aren't willing to go. This leads to the film's most effective scene, when she breaks into George Harvey's home and searches for clues. The suspense is palpable, to say the least.

If only the rest of the film had been as well-crafted. There's no denying that deep emotion courses through the story, and yes, much of it is relatable. In addition, there is something to be said for sparing the audience from disturbing visuals that would have amounted to nothing but shock value, namely Susie's murder and dismemberment. And, of course, the scenes of Susie in spirit-world are visually creative; I especially enjoyed a shot of gigantic ship-in-a-bottle kits sailing on a turbulent ocean and crashing against the rocky shore, which happens just as Jack angrily smashes his own ship-in-a-bottle collection. None of this is an issue. What is an issue is that, for everything it was meant to be emotionally and visually, the inconsistent tones and development of character made none of it convincing.

That being said, I'm sure many will respond to this movie, regardless of whether or not they've read Sebold's novel. Not everyone can relate to the pain of losing a loved one, especially if violence was involved, but most can imagine what it must be like, and the simple truth is that Peter Jackson knows this and uses it to his advantage. Take from this movie what you will. I personally would have preferred a more coherent screenplay, one that relied less on narrative passages and more on plot, plausible character development, and style. It would be too much to say that ""The Lovely Bones"" is a bad film; in spite of the end result, its heart was in the right place. It would be more accurate to say that it's awfully misguided, like singing when you know the words but not the music.",1261526400,42,5609,5.084690553745928

3766366,1,B001QOGYAO,"We were watching this movie during family movie time. For mostly part at the beginning and through to middle we loved it. However at the end everyone were extremely disappointed, actually very mad. The murdered girl was dead for over a year, no one could find the murderer, then her sister risked own life found the evidence, but the murderer was able to escaped and moved forward. The murdered girl used her last power to use a real girl body kissed her boyfriend instead of protecting her body evidence been permanently erased by the murderer. All the girls killed by the murdered in the past seem so easily and lightly forgot what they have been through. The cops could not do anything for the bad guy. He killed over a dozen girls and still live a normal life. His death in the end was hilarious, hit by an ice and fell of hill. Honestly we were all totally lost. What the movie was trying to bring us. If it was trying to teach us let those things go in your life and let karma to take care of murderer, it then is absolutely wrong and fake. Justice needs to be implemented not wait for happening by itself. The movie sets a bad example for younger generation as it teaches acceptance only instead of fighting for rigihts.",1515801600,,1227,4.433628318584071

Susie's neighbor, George Harvey, manages to convince her to join him in his underground den in the local cornfield. She is murdered and taken to a safe in Harvey's home. Susie's father begins to frantically look for her and this causes stress on his marriage. The mother gives up and eventually hates her husband Jack for continually dragging on the pain of the loss. When her little sister breaks into George Harvey's home and finds evidence she is able to call the police.  By this point, the parents have finally come to an agreement that Susie is gone and are able to overcome the past and reconcile their relationship.

3766402,2,B001QOGYAO,"*WARNING: Review may contain spoilers*

I can see the director's intent, add this movie did honestly have an intriguing concept; a girl loses her life prematurely, and is in some sort of in-between Heaven, trying to move on. In the meantime, because she is having trouble moving on, her family is also having trouble moving on from her death. That of itself was an interesting plot.
However, it was how Susie dies that is the primary issue with this film. She did not die from cancer or an accident, but was murdered by a neighbor. The scene of her screaming when she sees her neighbor washing away her blood was too hard to watch. It left me feeling emotionally sick and angry. The murder and rape of a child does not fly with audiences. The audience is more involved with the story involving the neighbor, rather than the supposed primary focus, of Susie moving on to Heaven. You are more anxious to see the neighbor receive karma for his disgusting crime, and when he finally does, it leaves you far too unsatisfied.
It does not help the movie changes from this grim secondary plot to the light-hearted moments in the primary plot from time to time. It all meshes together poorly and it makes the switching of scenes jarring.
I do not blame the director too much, since this movie was based on a book. Thus, the author shares the blame as well. If they had Susie die in any other way, then the story could have been much better, and it would leave me feeling actually satisfied.",1500508800,,1481,4.526119402985074

3766426,4,B001QOGYAO,"This is an excellent film by Peter Jackson. It's wonderfully shot. Thrilling and tense. The surreal elements are stunning and inventive, and yet it is probably more compelling in what it chooses not to show. The acting is solid all around (Wahlberg is sort of the weak link here, but not terrible by any means -- if anything, he seems miscast), but the real stand-out is Saoirse Ronan. It's amazing that she can be so young and yet display such sensitivity and nuance in her performance. This isn't just raw talent but the polish of an actress many many years into her career. The conclusion, I thought, wasn't exactly fulfilling. It felt a little too simple and very much lacking in seeing through the telos of all the emotional turmoil Suzie's death had wrought. The reconciliation as well felt rushed. There was definitely a beat or two of story missing from it. But up until this moment I thought it was a pretty incredible ride.",1497830400,,933,4.66060606060606

This is an artistic production taking a difficult first person story to film. There are some changes, but most are for the ability to portray author Alice Sebold's amazing story.

CAST is outstanding, each portraying the book characters very well. Casting Director did an excellent job.

Susan Sarandon -- the alcoholic grandmother -- perfect portrayal from book's character
Rachel Weisz -- excellent casting as Susie's mother
Mark Wahlberg -- the perfect choice for Susie's dad. Plays bereavement for his daughter very well.
Stanley Tucci -- as Mr. Harvey is excellent portraying the pedophile neighbor. He is creepy.
Satires Ronan -- excellent young actress portraying Susie Salmon (like the fish), the fourteen year old daughter murdered by Mr. Harvey

3766499,3,B001QOGYAO,"There is a lot to like about this epic Peter Jackson take on a remarkable short novel by Alice Sebold. My main issue is that Jackson seems obsessed with taking relatively short books and telescoping them out into Epic film treatments - a.k.a. The Hobbit one, two and, really, three? In some respects, once you decide to do this, the relationship between the book and the film becomes tenuous, at best. I am not a big ""the book and the film have to agree"" people (i think that argument is stupid) but when you do this kind of short-book-to-long-film adaptation one problem you have is either you use a lot of visuals to make up for the sparse dialogue, or you make up dialogue, which I think is a mistake. Here Jackson creates stunning visuals (in doing the former) but the lack of dialogue hampers him. Especially with Marc Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz. This may be Wahlberg's worst screen performance, and Weisz - once of our most interesting English-language actresses -- is pretty much wasted. On the bright side, Saorise Ronan is revelatory in the main protagonist role and Stanley Tucci is remarkable in a role he reportedly really, really did not want to play. I would give it four stars if it had been shorter.",1479686400,,1214,4.625

3766504,5,B001QOGYAO,"The main theme depicted in the film The Lovely Bones is family. The film is about a 14 year old girl, Susie Salmon, and her family being torn apart after her abduction and murder. The mental strength of each member of her family is being tested during this time. As the family is it their job to provide the structural, relational, and functional dimensions to one and other in times of need. Susie's family does almost the opposite of that. Susie's mother portrays an idea of what society has constructed to be a bad mother. She selfishly leaves her family in a time of need dumping all the weight of the family on her husband Jack. Jack fulfills both parent roles quite well until he suffers a heart attack and barely has the will to live. Susie's sister Lindsey then steps up to care for herself and her little brother Buckley. This is a great example of family working together to survive in dark times. Lindsey is quite determined to figure out who Susie's murderer was and she puts herself in a load of danger just to find out. At the end of the movie the mother returns after realizing her love for Jack and her family and knowing she was wrong. The family does their best to put certain events in the past and move on with their lives while still remembering their sweet daughter Susie.",1477094400,,1294,4.4641350210970465

The characters are likable and well developed. But there are constant distractions from the central plot which has a couple very promising threads that go nowhere.

Spoilers

The girl medium.... goes nowhere. The father's investigation... nowhere. The daughter's discovery....nowhere. The resolution is crammed into 10 minutes and we are supposed to accept that moving on (without any real resolution to any of these) is the Important thing. And its wrapped up hurriedly with an accident....... WTF!! This is about existential musings and characters.... but ultimately the plot meanders and walks off like an Alzheimer's patient.

Dragged out.
Full of holes.
Didn't make sense.
In poor taste.

Deeper into the movie, I realized that it was not something for the kids, but I was still intrigued. I have just cried the biggest tears of my life!!! I had never read book, but have just put it on hold at the library. This writer invokes emotions and feelings that do upset you, but reminds you that sometimes life is unfair and it hurts.

Everything about this movie has captivated me since I first saw it. After I did see it, I remember I kept thinking ""I need to watch that again!""

I don't want to give away too much of the movie, so go watch it! But I will say that the actors' are phenomenal in this movie and although some things are dragged on quite a while, the message and the visual pleasure was still very powerful. I think this also perfectly illustrates how criminals aren't always seedy looking people with run-down houses or visibly distraught, some criminals and ""bad men"" are in plain clothes and are actually good at covering up their tracks. They know that they must appear normal to be viewed as normal, while some movies continue to make criminals out to be ""obvious.""",1456358400,5,1047,4.5396825396825395

3767007,5,B001QOGYAO,"Watched ""The Lovely Bones"" years ago in a theater, then again tonight.
Few movies connect twice like this one.

There are movies about murder. Some reviewers appear to have believed this is a movie about murder.

There are movies about the effects of sudden senseless violent death. That is what this movie is about. There is plenty of tension but most of the violence is implied/understood rather than splattered all over the screen. In fact, the cinematography is very, very good in every aspect of the movie. It raised the subject matter to a level that made me think about cultural aspects of the senseless killing of young people as  the movie's events unfolded.

The movie's events are detailed by other reviewers better than I can do it. In sum, a hopeful child is murdered by a serial killer-pedophile. The murder is not solved quickly. Individual and family problems are magnified as a result. These are portrayed about as tastefully as personal and family problems can be. Events are witnessed by the murder victim, whose eyes brought to mind the eyes of other young victims of senseless violence, and whose own character development continued throughout the movie in a beautifully surreal purgatory between adolescence and heaven.

The emotion the movie left me with is best described as worthwhile melancholia. How can we validate the lives of murdered children? Is Karma, or having the law punish child murderers enough? My feeling is, probably not; yet, what else can there be? My feeling is the closest most of us can  get to validating the life of a murdered child is wishing it didn't happen so often. My feelings about murdered children are not too different from my feelings at The Wall. Senseless violence is not easily contemplated, but some movies do it better than others.

I will watch this movie again. And wonder the same things again.",1454112000,,1861,4.888888888888889
3767008,4,B001QOGYAO,"Read the book to understand the movie. The book has less dreamscapes but more rich  plot development where  characters are believable and fully engaging. Small things like Susie s charm bracelet, and minor characters play a more intricate role in the book.  The movie did an amazing CG work of weaving Suzie and her Heaven and outreach to her family - but misses the richness of the books probing depths into the rape of innocence , both the child and the era, the 1970s.  Stanley Tucci gives a superb performance and truly captures the chilling sociopath without including all of his characters totally vile and depraved nature you will find in the book. I'm glad I had the roadmap of the book to light the way and bring the text to life----all the characters in the book are perfectly, well, brilliantly cast and when I read the book a second time the movie illuminated the authors vision in colorful and imaginative detail.",1454112000,5,926,4.697530864197531

It is hard to describe this movie because it was beautiful, sad and violent at the same time.  It is about a young girl who is murdered by a serial killer.  Her spirit tries to lead her father to her murderer.

It is beautiful because it shows that love survives death.  It is sad because a young life is taken.  It is violent because of what this serial killer has done over the years.",1453161600,2,527,4.158415841584159

3767126,4,B001QOGYAO,"Normally avoid movies in the fantasy subgenre, but this one touched on several emotions of the human heart: loss, anger, longing, meaning, and so on. Rich in imagery.  One delicate, ethereal young girl, whose emotions and pain are contained in her own innocence now moving in an unearthly dimension, is starkly opposed to the most violent and savage desire and behavior of those who are on earth. At some point the two words collide, though through flashes the viewer sees the connection between these two words.

3767320,5,B001QOGYAO,Both this book and this movie stand out in their own genres as there are no other stories quite like this one. The book is geared toward adolescents who easily grasp this girl's spiritual crisis and tragedy. Teenagers don't fear the question of what happens when we die. The movie is geared toward both teenage and adult audiences. I believe it is the adult's inability to both identify with the teenage girl and also to face the questions the movie forces them to face about the afterlife and perhaps their whole spirituality that prevented this movie from becoming a commercial success.,1441152000,2,588,4.8316831683168315

I had not thought through how painful the subject matter would be to watch, as a mother. There were three times I was so frightened and horrified I could barely breath, and had to leave the room.

The communication between the slain girl and her family continues for a while through simple imagery in spontaneous moments. No one can control or direct these moments, they just arise. At times they are wonderfully understated - a shadow passing, a gazebo loosing the paint, a whithered flower....at other times they are enormous and surreal.

3767536,1,B001QOGYAO,"Alice Sebold's The Lovely Bones is one of my all-time favorite novels. Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy is an excellent book-to-film adaptation. What went wrong in his cinematic interpretation of Sebold's masterpiece? Just about everything. While there are great films that match or exceed their source material, the constant dictum of bookworms that films rarely do the original text justice has a good amount of truth to it, and that is probably never more true than in this case. Jackson discards major and critical plot points and turns a smart, subtle, brilliant (and quite possibly unfilmable) novel into a big Hollywood blockbuster that doesn't work at all.

Even more egregiously, Jackson doesn't really seem to get what made the book so great in the first place. At its heart, Sebold's novel is about a horrific crime and while it captures the impossible horror that its young protagonist Susie Salmon goes through with honesty, it also finds a way to breathe life and even beauty into the bleak worldview that it establishes. It's a very delicate balance, one that many writers would fail miserably at, but Sebold handles it perfectly. On the other hand, Jackson fumbles for 139 minutes in trying to make some sort of inept and whimsical fantasy film that defies categorization and is ineffable for all the wrong reasons. I'll leave it at this: never judge a book by its movie, particularly if that book is The Lovely Bones.",1425945600,6,1443,4.938271604938271

I was stunned by the beautiful visual effects and camera work, and the beautiful retelling of the story as a film.

First I want to commend the author, Alice Sebold, for writing this great fictional story. Im not only an author, but Im screenwriter too. Therefore, I can imagine how difficult it was for the screenwriters, Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, and Peter Jackson, to write the script. Well done!! Young actress, Saoirse Ronan, was a perfect choice. What amazing blue eyes she has, her voice is like that of an angel, and her acting is superb!

This film was directed by Peter Jackson and I'm not normally a fan of his films, but I think he did an amazing job on The Lovely Bones. I've read the novel and there are some slight differences but overall, I thought the screenplay was a classy and faithful adaptation. Saorise Ronan is a superb as the protagonist, Susie. Ronan is a gifted actress, she is wise beyond her years. The emotion in her eyes and face is spellbinding to watch. I wish she did more films because I think she's brilliant. Stanley Tucci also gives a chilling performance as Mr. Harvey, the man who ends Susie's life early on in the film. This is not a happy story but it's an important story. It's beautiful to look at and beautifully written. I highly recommend it!",1407715200,,865,4.551282051282051

What a beautiful young lady. The whole cast did a wonderful job even stanlely tucci who I admire as an actor. This movie definitely tugs at the hear and soul and touches on the realization of a somewhat unknown reality of heaven and murdered souls. I though this was a lovely portrayal of a beautiful soul robbed of life and the justice that God brings. I know it touched on a lot of deep subject in a general sense but we all know deep down that sense of justice we all long for especially in cases of murder... this movie reminded me of a scripture and I think rightly so this movie accurately portrayed a heavenly beauty... 2 cor. 7:11For behold what earnestness this very thing, this godly sorrow, has produced in you: what vindication of yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what longing, what zeal, what avenging of wrong!

3767959,3,B001QOGYAO,"Lovely Bones is a long convoluted story of ""I was murdered"".  The movie deals with the atrocity and aftermath of it all.  It shows the family slowly crumble and wither.

Clocking in over two hours, Lovely Bones could have dropped 30 minutes more to the editors and cutting room floor in order to keep the viewer from losing both patience and interest.

Stanley Tucci's make up looks like one of Bruce Willis' characters in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Jackal/dp/B001VM0LAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Jackal</a>, or, as I also saw Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Pink-Panther/dp/B001H1UQDW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Pink Panther</a>. Tucci does an awesome job conveying the calm and portraying George Harvey, the murderer of at least 10 girls and young women in the Northeast during a 10 year period.

Only his need to have to keep a souvenir of his victims does Harvey leave a trail in which victim Susie Salmon, ""Like the fish,"" younger sister Lindsey expose the truth.",1399680000,,1115,6.167741935483871

3768006,5,B001QOGYAO,"This movie is not a huge blockbuster, action packed or gore packed film.  It is a very quite film actually, but one that really has the ability to stir very deep emotions because of the excellent script and acting.  I had not remembered seeing Saoirse Ronan until she starred in The Host, but since then I've become very aware of her body of work and I think she is an actress to watch.  She is very beautiful in a very understated way, has a soft soothing voice and when acting always seems genuine, never wooden.  The description of this movie is a little misleading - it says that she is watching over her family, when actually she is in an ""in between"" place - refusing to move on since her killer is still on the loose.

The movie shows how much losing a child can tear a family apart from inside and how it changes each from in different ways.  I found myself crying, with tears running down my face many times during this film, hurting for the family, hating the killer - knowing that this happens in America every day.

Again, don't expect a fast action blockbuster - this is more of a movie that is gear to get you to really THINK about the family, the child, the killer and his victims.  I don't want to give the ending away, but I will say that I was heartbroken at the end with how her body was never recovered (even thou you do see where it ends up) and that the killer does get justice - but it's not at the hands of the police.  I would have like seeing him rot in a prison cell, because I know how other prisoners view men that kill little girls.

Give this movie a chance, it might move a little slow, but it has a very deep message that IS very common found in today's news headlines, unfortunately.",1397692800,,1717,4.223241590214068

3768012,1,B001QOGYAO,"This story is so bafflingly awful - and poorly told - that is hard to know what to focus on? Hm...
So let's say you were raped and murdered. It's awful, but that is what happened in the movie. When you come back from heaven, what you would you do with your one last moment on earth:
A) tell the cops/your parents/anyone how you were murdered and where your body is,
B) tell the dude who is unknowingly helping your murderer dispose of your body, ""hey dude, call the cops, this guy's a murderer and my body is in this box so like don't help him. M'kay?"", or
C) have creepy sex with some dude you had a crush on in school, which is an odd choice since you were RAPED before you were murdered?
I guess if you answered C you won't mind that the rest of story is as equally imbecilic, lacking rationale or motivations that any normal/sane person would engage in, and/or that the awful murderer [spoiler here - but really I am saving you. Your welcome.] is never caught. He just falls off a cliff. That's how he dies?! I really couldn't think of anything more absurd. What? No anvil to drop on his head? No clown car to run him over with? Nothing? So he's never caught. There is no justice. Or closure for anyone in the book or the reader, for that matter. Just random nonsense. Call me old-fashioned but if I endure a movie that is essentially about some girl getting raped and murdered - EXPOSE. HER. KILLER. so I can pretend I didn't waste 2 hours of my life.

It turns out to be a beautiful movie, one that is not soon forgotten. It is not overly mushy.  I thought the casting was great - especially the part of the murdered girl.  Perfection.  It comes from a novel, which I've read.  The movie is much like the book, but the book has a bit more detail.  Tastefully done, it is a good gift idea for some.",1395964800,2,652,4.078740157480315

3768040,4,B001QOGYAO,"{4.25 stars}

At first glance, THE LOVELY BONES looks like it could be rather corny and underdone. Nevertheless, this is a very unique and satisfying film. Though some of the acting and directions are not the greatest, Saoirse Ronan and several others give good performances here. THE LOVELY BONES is one of those films that is at once heartwarming and heartbreaking.

THE LOVELY BONES is an interesting mix of fantasy, teen drama, and horror with Disneyesque--and I mean that in a good way--special effects and props. The afterlife scenes are absolutely breathtaking, and, although the plot-line wavers in places and has its share of holes, it's never dull, keeps your attention, and doesn't come out anywhere near as predictably as you might think. Set in the 1970s, THE LOVELY BONES captures that period most convincingly. While it sometimes has the feel of an After-School Special, there is one pretty gruesome (for a PG-13) post-murder dream sequence, which contributes still more to its interesting blend of qualities.

Never seen anything like it, and highly recommend!",1395446400,5,1076,5.172413793103448

I feel like the ""meat"" of the many stories going on was missed by taking that time for cinematography fluff. I was disappointed and feel like I need to finish reading the book. I know you can't put every detail from the book in the movie - but I think they could have done a much better job.

3768102,5,B001QOGYAO,"This is a murder movie done so tastefully that it makes grown adults whine about it. The blood lust crew can't stand that this movie avoids the graphic horror and instead captures the raw pain that the victim and the victim's family felt.

If you are open-minded and willing to accept the screenplay at face value, you too will give this five stars. It is one of the most compelling movies I have ever viewed. It is beautifully filmed, much like Half Light. If you like ghost tales, you will like Half Light and The Lovely Bones.

This movie is packed with surreal images. These are the things the author and director used to fill in the blanks of the Unknown. It supercharges the emotional impact while skipping over the burdensome closed-minded contentions.

It is odd to hear people argue that this movie wrongly depicts heaven. I assume that the reviewers are still alive, and thus unlikely to have visited the place. Yet, they are so limited in their cognitive fortitude that they argue a position they cannot ever hope to backup with proof.  Is God so limited?  I hope not. After all, He allegedly created the entire universe, as well as the minds of humans who conjure up images such as are portrayed in the movie. But that is a beach ball for another shore. LOL!

I found the essence of this effort to be about the innate justice which is built into our existence. Some call it Karma. But the movie is neither pretentious nor definitive about any position. It could be said that, in the long-range scope, the movie depicts good triumphing over evil. It could be said that it speaks to the necessity of accepting fate and letting go.

Nowhere in this movie, in my opinion, did it EVER imply in any stretch of the imagination that the murders were ""God's plan"" and so it was okay. The reviewer who espoused THAT position may wish to study the difference between plasterboard and actual crack. Smoking plasterboard can vividly affect one's perceptions, and leave a gaping hole in the wall.  LOL!

The One Star Bandits like to leave reviews like ""THIS SUCKS! SAVE YOUR MONEY!""  I cannot grasp why anyone thinks such a comment is helpful to potential movie viewers. One must be of the belief that all who read such a review will be automatically swayed to act like a lemming and follow suit. FASCISTS!  Ya gotta love em. I guess.

Actually, in my opinion, this is one of the best movies made. It tastefully deals with a disgusting subject, packs lots of emotional roller coaster ride, explores the thoughts and feelings that the dead may have, deals with coping and the emotions the survivors may have, and delivers a unique visual experience with a high degree of creativity, imagination and artistic content.

I only render Five Stars because AMAZON will not allow TEN!  This one goes on my TOP TEN LIST, along with the likes of HALF LIGHT, SIGNS, and THE SIXTH SENSE!  Watch this movie without preconceived prejudices, and receive all the wonder, awe, and raw emotion that it so effectively delivers.

PS: Help me understand why people want a movie to mirror the book version?  If I had read the book, I would expect something different in the movie. They are not the same. They should NOT be the same, otherwise why make the movie. The movie version is typically the adaptation of the book by some third party screenplay writer.  Book readers and movie-goers are NOT the same audience. Sure, there is SOME overlap, but by-and-large, it is well-established that the two tribes are separate. Also, elements of story-telling that work well in the minds of readers do not translate well to video imagery. This is why we have the latitude of a wide range of media for expression.

3768156,4,B001QOGYAO,"Adapting Alice Sebold's widely-read novel about the murder of a 14-year-old girl and her afterlife to a film would be a daunting task for any filmmaker.  Those who admired the book would deplore any deviation, whereas those who had not would question the propriety of making a film about such a gruesome topic in the first place.  Peter Jackson - forever chained to his reputation as the director of the Lord of the Rings films - was excoriated by the critics for his adaptation; criticism which was generally unjustified.

Many critics attacked Bones on the basis of the scenes of the victim's afterlife.  Many of them sneered at the computer graphics involved, comparing them unfavorably to those seen in the Rings films.  Some said that ""no new ground was broken"" by the effects, whereas others complained that any CG images smacked of idiotically saccharine sentimentality.  A fair evaluation would be whether the effects seamlessly served its narrative purpose in the film; it did.  Those who disliked the whole afterlife schtick would have disliked it in the novel as well.

Some disliked the jolting shifts between the two moods of the film: sentimental and brutal.  That juxtaposition was the entire point of both book and film.  If the viewer couldn't handle it, more is said about the viewer than the filmmaker.  In any case, Jackson had difficult decisions to make about how much violence to show.  He avoids showing the killer in action, but he doesn't avoid showing the blood that remains afterwards.  Different directors would have made different choices, but Jackson's approach is valid and - insofar as he's addressing a distasteful act - tasteful.

The casting is strong; Saorise Ronan as the murdered girl is remarkable.  Stanley Tucci - so solid in so many roles - is somewhat miscast as the murderer; though he conveys evil well, he's not very credible as an outdoorsman.

My main problem with the film is the depiction of the killer's end.  It implies an act of vengeance from the girl's spirit, thereby making a fairly innocent and very sympathetic character somewhat... ignoble.  An ironic ending - one in which the killer comes afoul of another felon's trap - would have served the film much better.",1391212800,,2223,4.93010752688172

3768268,3,B001QOGYAO,"The Lovely Bones was an award winning novel, turned into a major motion picture in 2009. Peter Jackson signed on to Direct and Steven Spielberg was the Executive Producer, so the budget for this film was massive, but it didn't do so well, leading people to believe it was a bad movie. While it was different from what the readers expected, the film was still better than average. The story is told by Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan), a 14 year old girl, who was murdered. Susie introduces us to her family and to her killer in what I saw as a mix between Ghost and What Dreams May Come. The story is extremely strong and very well written, but it isn't without it's problems. For instance, we learn the identity of the murderer almost immediately. There are also huge gaps in the story between when we see Susie in purgatory and when we see her families again. Saorise Ronan plays Susie and continues to amaze me. I honestly haven't been that crazy about most of the films I've seen her in, but she never seizes to amaze me. It really is only a matter of time until she's in the right film and gets national attention. By then, not only will people know her name, but they'll know how to pronounce it too. She is supported by some big names like Stanley Tucci, who at this point in his career has convinced me that he can play just about any role. The Lovely Bones is a great story, but it wasn't done in a way that appeals to mass audiences. The scenes in purgatory were never ending and there are big holes in the story, but the cast is terrific and the story is really good. If you're into films that stray from the norm, you might really enjoy this one.",1387324800,,1654,4.321543408360129

3768270,4,B001QOGYAO,"I've seen this film reap more than its fair share of criticism, an outcome I find disappointing as this film is far better than it has been made out to be.

Indeed, there are flaws to be seen in the film. I personally did not read the book so I cannot judge whether it digresses from the book distinctly. The timeline is not always clear, some scenes feel out of place, like they should have gone elsewhere. The film is muddled and unclear in places. Yet these criticisms, while certainly valid in their own right, truly miss the spirit of the film.

This is not a film about justice, crime solving, or spirituality. One need only keep in mind emotion to enjoy this film. It does a remarkable job of tearing your heart out and eating it alive. Throughout, you follow the characters through successive stages of heartache and grief: you share their worry when Susan goes missing,  their agony when they realize that she isn't coming back, you feel the wound of loss, the deep gaping hole which will never be filled. You feel your world collapse around you as the characters do. I, as a grown man, was teary-eyed throughout. Eventually, one must move on, yet, even though you do, you share the change that these sad events has forced upon the characters. You can truly be sucked into this film, feel its emotion, on account of the remarkable performances by all the actors involved. I truly felt like I was sitting beside them, sharing in their pain. The soundtrack is somber and reflective, and always does its job of amplifying emotion.

Now, the reason this film merits 4 instead of 5 stars. This can be summed up quite succinctly: if you go into this film trying to be critical, trying to spot the flaws, you will not enjoy it. This vortex is difficult to escape at times, but if you can overcome this, you will truly enjoy this movie.",1386979200,5,1837,4.524096385542169

And without giving away too many details there is a happy ending and Susie's spirit does find some resolutions to what she has missed out on.

I did read the book, and I found the movie ( although at times not true to the book) wonderful, and haunting. The acting was superb, and I think there are two classes of people who like and do not like this movie: those who are spiritual/mystical and question the afterlife, and those who are practical-minded and do not. This is a movie where you have to ""read between the pages"" and open up your mind to the questions it so deeply portrays. Sure, we are all used to Peter Jackson directing the ""Lord of the Rings"" stuff, and this is certainly ""out of his box"", but that does not mean it is an ill-fit.
My husband has not read the book, and he thought the movie was deep, challenging to the mind, and very well acted. He is not one who usually likes ""slower"" nor ""deeper"" movies. Why Rotten Tomatoes gave it a low rating... who knows? I am so glad I not only read
the book, but viewed the movie as well. In my opinion, ( and I'm not an avid television or entertainment watcher and do not own a television, nor do I have cable), this was masterfully and thoughtfully done, and was worth every bit of the watching.",1381449600,2,1186,4.252212389380531

3768390,5,B001QOGYAO,"The movie has its graphic moments, which was the reason I turned off the movie midway. However, the depictions of the afterlife and Saroise's soul penetrating eyes got me watching the movie again after reading the spoiler in wikipedia. The second time around I saw details and screenplay that I completely missed on the first viewing. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. The plot gave us a good message in the midst of tragedy, namely healing begins with moving on. The screenplay was full of unexpected twists and turns. For instance, the movie watcher did not even know the antagonist of the story died until 3 scenes later when the antagonist sees her murder soaking in a bathtub.

The acting --- it was beyond compare. Saroise Ronan (Susie) had a way of looking at you that utterly penetrated our soul. Her facial expressions were nothing short of magical - the watcher can read her every emotion and can't help but feel compassion for her. How can a 13 year old portray so perfectly such grave subject matter? I wanted to cry every time she cried. Wow. The murderer had the perfect look. He gives you goose bumps just by his slow and deliberate actions and his almost emotionless face - fitting of someone with no conscience. Perfect portrayal of a serial killer.

The symbolism - they are everywhere - the gondola, the candle, the tree of life, the bracelet, the safe, the iceicle, the sinkhole - just to name a few. But you'd miss them if you watch the movie just once. Along with the message of the movie, these symbols glue the plot elements together in a way I have never seen in any other movie. Focus especially on the icicle, the gondola and the sink-hole. Watch the movie twice and you'll see what I mean.

The message. Regardless of your faith, the movie has some positive messages behind an otherwise tragic plot.
  - healing begins with moving on
  - to move on once must confront one's fears and confront reality
  - our loved ones live on in our memories, but don't let it be a barrier to moving on

Overall, despite the critics' negative reviews, I think it is an extremely well acted out movie with an exceptional screenplay built on a surprising plot that manages to portray healing and growth after tragedy. It is a phenomenal movie. Just watch it more than once. Better yet, read wikipedia and then watch it.",1380758400,3,2336,4.59375

Basically show how the murdered girl has a great time in limbo and the the killer dies from an incident (as if it was meant by an almighty power, but what did this not happen the first time to get rid of this killer???)

Other situations seems just unjustifiable, when the sister of the murdered girl finds proof of the killer but decides to withhold it because ... her parents just got happy .. really???

Who writes such dumb stories. This movie should be labelled ""For teenage girls only"". what a waste of time!

Come on Peter Jackson, admit it, you directed this lame movie just for the money. He made murder movie into a fairy tale :(

CGI is cool but I have seen this done before. Does not really add to the story.",1375488000,2,849,4.3081761006289305

3768480,5,B001QOGYAO,Very good movie.  Background scenes in New Zealand are awesome.  Peter Jackson has done another great job.  I don't like the minimum word thing for reviews.  I shouldn't have to write a novel to say if I liked or disliked something,1374796800,2,231,4.560975609756097
3768481,5,B001QOGYAO,"Even though I heard this movie was good, I put off seeing it for a long time because of the subject matter. I feared it would be gory and very depressing. However, I was very pleasantly surprised. It was actually a beautiful, tender film -- not terribly graphic at all. The murder scene was kept more PG -- with the details of the murder more implied than graphically shown. They focused less on the murder itself and more on the girl's spirit struggling with the idea of leaving her loved ones behind and going on to Heaven or staying and helping them to get over her death and catch her killer. It was very dreamlike -- sort of like Ghost meets What Dreams May Come -- two movies I also enjoyed very much.

It portrays the rape and murder of an innocent young girl, and her subsequent narration from heaven about how her absence effects those in her life. Stanley Tucci nails the despicable serial killer's friendly banter and style as he attempts to gain the trust of those he encounters.

I first read the book in 10th grade and loved it. had to read it again before the movie came out, too.

3768560,4,B001QOGYAO,"When I first saw the movie, I actually didn't like it.  This is the problem when you've read the book first.  The book has so much more ""meat"" in it that didn't make it into the movie.  You don't really see the full impact that occurs to the family in the movie as you do in the book.  Characters are not developed to the point as they were in the book.  The mysterious world of Heaven is not explained as well in the movie.  This story has several interwoven plotlines.  First, Heaven is not what Susie expected it...for it certainly goes totally against the typical view of it.  Second, there is the unraveling of her family due to the stress of her death...and how it is rebuilt, and how each character develops.

However, the movie would have lasted forever if they had included all of this.  Overall, I would say that they chose the most important parts.  The actors were very good--particularly Susan Surandon--who stoled the spotlight.  The movie may be slow moving for some people.  This isn't a murder mystery or action film.  It is one of those ""slow-moving"" sort-of philosophical type of movies.  It is also sort of a coming of age story, though it actually probably more a ""coming of terms"" story since the main character is dead.  What I found particularly interesting about this story was how optimistic it could be...""a feel good story""...when it deals with such a horrible topic.

The entire movie feels a bit cold...disconnected, almost. It only spans over such a short period of time and a considerable amount of important events were missing completely. Sebold takes time to depict Susie's world as it is, and that effort was clearly lacking from the movie.

After reading the book, I guess I had high standards. Unfortunately, this just couldn't live up to what I saw as Susie Salmon's world.",1367452800,,592,4.6380952380952385

Our protagonist was amazing, I was so impressed with her. I went to eh Host movies base don this performance. Stanley Tucci steps out of his usual quirky and funny roles to play the villain, and i think he pulled it off with a surprising level of believability. Everyone in the move was great, Susan Sarandon (she's always great) and Rachel Weiz. Even the unknown girl playing the sister (forgive me, I didn't recognize her) gave a powerful performance.

3768846,2,B001QOGYAO,"I think the plot of ""the Lovely Bones"" is enormously appealing as a concept.  Who wouldn't want to think that a loved one who just vanished was watching over them in Heaven?  And maybe that's the way it really happens...nobody will know for sure until they make their own voyage to what Shakespeare's Hamlet called ""the undiscovered country.""

But I just couldn't bear to watch the movie beyond the horrendous opening where the narrator meets such a horrific end...brutally raped, murdered, and dismembered by a pedophile.  It was just too nauseating even though they didn't actually show the rape and murder taking place...just showing the killer taking a bath in a room spattered with blood was too much for me.

And knowing that the movie would have the murderer as a major character and that he would continue to abduct and murder young girls was just too much for me.  Even if the killer got his just desserts in the end, that doesn't undo the evil and grief he caused.

For those who liked aspects of this story but couldn't accept the ugliness it unfortunately contains, I'd like to recommend a TV series that was on Showtime about a decade ago called ""Dead Like Me.""  It centers around a young woman who meets a tragic end and lingers on as a spirit who lives on the Earth who takes souls out of the bodies of the living when they die so they can go on to the afterlife.  She appears as a human and can even watch her family cope with her death but she can't interact with them.  That series is at turns poignant, humorous, and deeply moving and at no time did it ever trigger the revulsion that ""the Lovely Bones"" movie made me feel.

And those who love the ""Lovely Bones"" would like it too I think.

3768904,4,B001QOGYAO,"It's hard to categorize this film but if I describe it as a fantasy drama, that would probably be closest. It was produced by Peter Jackson from a novel by Alice Sebold. It is a story about 14-year-old Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan) who is abducted by serial paedophile killer George Harvey (Stanley Tucci) while she is wandering dreamily through a cornfield. The fantasy description comes in because, after representing her family's anguish at her disappearance, much of the film is taken up with Susie's view of life from the afterlife and how the disappearance of her body affects the lives of the rest of the family. The father in particular is keen to avenge the death of his little girl. The parents, Jack and Abigail Salmon, are played by Rachel Weisz and Mark Wahlberg. There is little more than a cameo part for Susan Sarandon as Susie's grandmother. We know almost at the start who the killer is, so it's only a matter of whether or not he will be caught.

3768909,4,B001QOGYAO,"After loving the book, I was thrilled to hear Peter Jackson was doing a movie based on it. When I saw so many negative reviews from both critics and the general public, my enthusiasm was gone but my curiosity wasn't. After finally seeing it I can say that while it's not as good as the book (few movies are), it's still very good.

Some storylines were omitted, such as the mother's little affair with the police officer and the investigation into Ray as a potential suspect. There were some small changes to the plot but I didn't feel any of them detracted from it. One example was the police finding a lot of blood at the crime scene instead of finding a body part later on. The change seemed to be done to accelerate the police process - right away they basically knew it was a murder not a kidnapping. Most of the important story elements were here - the actions of the father and sister in pursuit of the killer, the ultimate outcome for the killer. The rape and murder itself isn't as graphic as in the book but it's still done very effectively and is more than enough to make one feel creeped out. Even though I knew what was going to happen, I still felt ill at ease during the scene.

I enjoyed Jackson's portrayal of Susie's ""near heaven"", particularly the scene with the crashing bottle ships. It was a bit more fantastically shown than it's portrayed in the book (this is the same director as ""Lord of the Rings"" after all), but it worked well with the story rather than overwhelming it. The characters each seemed faithful to the book and the acting was very good all around. Throughout I felt the movie did a good job walking the line between depressing and hopeful.

The film has some beautiful moments but I just wish Peter Jackson had restrained himself on the VFX which are over the top, too polished and gooey for the nature of this story. As with all artists he had the right balance in Heavenly Creatures VFX all those years ago when the technology was much more primitive, but with this it is a case of too many flourishes and poor design.

There aren't many movies I look forward to watching a second time, and even fewer I want to watch a third time.

3768979,3,B001QOGYAO,"***SPOILER ALERT COMING****This film could have been mind blowingly good. However, certain details really ruined it. I read the book and not all the flops are the film's fault. The book employs a similar philosophy of dying as ""What dreams may come."" I somehow saw the version of The lovely bones with the rape scene before it was deleted to make a better rating. The scene was so disturbing, yet I felt was courageous in showing what our society obviously doesn't think about enough; the rape of children. The death was so horrible that it is too much to ask us that Susie's character wouldn't go through more emotions than just one moment of rage while watching her father get attacked.***** SPOILER ALERT**** It was a very interesting and cool move to have Susie meet the other victims in ""the between"" and to hint that they were connected and needed each other to move on, but why was that only hinted at? Why wasn't it explored more? You see Susie crying when she sees them and they are all smiling but isn't this a little unrealistic? When you deal with a terrible situation you go through many more emotions that this and it would have been great to see them somehow deal with it together. Like the girls in the movie ""FoxFire."" Why is Susie crying? She loves her family so much, why are we supposed to be satisfied with her heaven when it is solipsistic and ""her own world."" That is a very western individualistic value. Like, ""what dreams may come"" it is assumed that heaven would be a place of your own like an automobile you buy or a house you own? That is ridiculous. Susie loves her family so much, why are we to think she would be completely satisfied in a heaven where all she has in common with those who great her is that the same creepy guy killed them?

3769006,5,B001QOGYAO,"I don't own this movie (yet!) but I'd certainly like to.  This is one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen.  From the very start it pulled me in, and made me attached to the characters.  I found it heart-rending and terrifying, the idea of a young girl being murdered, and the person responsible going on with normal life, as if nothing has happened.
Most movies don't trigger as strong an emotional response for me as ""The Lovely Bones"" did.  I felt almost vulnerable, even sitting here, safe in my own home.  I felt disgusted and hatred at the type of person who would brutally murder someone, especially a child.
I was a bit hesitant to watch this movie, as I wasn't sure whether it would tend too much towards violence, and/or I was worried it would just be rather bizarre and not all that great.
First of all, there is hardly any violence actually shown in the movie: the violence is mostly implied, so there is not really a ""grotesque factor"".  Secondly, in order to appreciate this movie, you have to accept its artsy, other-worldly feel.  To me, it is not simply a movie, for entertainment's sake; it is a very realistic, emotional piece of artwork, that portrays life and death both as harshly and as gently as is possible.  By the end of ""The Lovely Bones"", I did not feel a deep sense of longing, or emotional distress: I surprisingly felt a deep sense of relief and peace.
""These were the lovely bones that had grown around my absence. The connections, sometimes tenuous, sometimes made at great cost, but often magnificent, that happened after I was gone. And I began to see things in a way that let me hold the world without me in it.""-Susie Salmon, ""The Lovely Bones"" (IMDb)",1334016000,2,1694,4.5493421052631575
3769007,2,B001QOGYAO,"I was very open in my review for the novel of my thoughts here.  The story just does not justify the hype.  This has been lauded and rendered a revelation by fans (the novel that is) and yet while reading it I couldn't help but feel extremely underwhelmed.  I wanted so much more, and instead of feeling inspired and deep and profound, `The Lovely Bones' felt amateurish and slightly cheap.

When I read that Peter Jackson was taking this on, I was intrigued for a number of reasons.  I am not the largest Jackson fan, but his more intimate works are really inspired.  He should make more `Heavenly Creatures' and less `Lord of the Rings', but whatever.  The idea of him taking a premise that could meld both worlds seemed inspired in his hands.  Any reservations I had with the source material seemed insignificant at that point.  The same story, told in more capable hands, can prove to be an entirely different experience, and with Jackson, Ronan, Weisz, Sarandon and Tucci on board (eh to Wahlberg, but whatever) I was really interested to see the turnout.

Sadly, this was actually worse than the novel.

The problem with `The Lovely Bones' is that it has no real identity.  Even in film format, this story feels almost skeletal.  It really needed a core, something to beat through the barrage of clich&eacute;s to create something that felt original or even remotely inspired.  Instead, `The Lovely Bones' builds on familiarity to create something devoid of anything compelling.

Ronan is an inspired actress, and she nails her performance.  She grasps the delicate naivety that floats in and out of our protagonist.  Her wide eyes wonderment soaked into the roots of the film to give it a slight heft in areas.  Sadly though, her performance isn't enough to save the film from itself.  The rest of the cast is barren.  Wahlberg is a mess, as expected.  He oversells his scenes and comes across highly unrealistic.  You can always see him acting.  Weisz is barely there, Sarandon is a caricature and Tucci is just plain awful, but I blame a lot of that on Jackson's too `on the nose' direction.  The way he frames his shots is gross.  I hate the way he shoots Tucci to be this `evil incarnate' instead of allowing the audience to be absorbed in the performance.  He has to tell us too much with the way he shoots each scene.  The music, the lighting, the pacing; it just all is too direct.  The visual effects are at times stunning, but other times it is rather garish and `too much'; like recent Tim Burton fare.  Jackson has had an issue with this in the past.

Some directors don't know when to stop adding buttons to the sash.

So, much like the novel, this is an underwhelming feature.  Ronan is wonderful, but the barrage of mediocrity here is too much to ignore.",1333065600,5,2775,4.622950819672131

3769064,3,B001QOGYAO,"To sum it up, this was a beautiful and disturbing film. The filmmaking and acting employed in this film are top-notch and credible. The imagery and visualizations of the ""inbetween"" are stunning and the vivid dream-like interpretation is gorgeous. Like I said, a beautiful film. The acting is very real and there are some stunning performances by Saoirse Ronan and Stanley Tucci. Even Marky Mark gives a good performance.
Now, with all that being said, the film is disturbing and extremely intense. It is not a film for the faint-hearted. If you know anything about the film, then you know that the story surrounds some very dark and horrid content. The film is about the murder of a 14-year old girl (Saoirse Ronan) and the search for her killer (Stanley Tucci). The scene where the murderer catches the girl in his trap is a long, uncomfortable, and nerve-racking moment in the film. But the most disturbing element of the film is not the crime itself, but the getting to know more about the murderer through the eyes of the little girl. The murder takes place 1/4 through the movie, the last 3/4 of the film focuses on the murderer and how creepy he really is. It's always uncomfortable to get inside the mind of a slaughterer. Tucci does an excellent job portraying this killer, and his believability really contributes to the power and eeriness of the film.

**Spoiler Alert**
While it is true that the men who commit similar crimes are rarely found, I hated that he got away in this film. The end of the film tries to give you some satisfaction by showing him fall over and bounce down a cliff-side to his death, but that wasn't enough for me. I felt that his death was too simple a fate for his crimes, I wanted him to suffer. That's how you know that a film does an excellent job creating the enemy; the audience's desire to annihilate him by the end of the movie.
You know, most inmates do not take kindly to child rapists or murderers. So, if I had my choice, I would have the guy get caught, and then have a final scene where a thug walks up to him in jail and says, ""I hear you been murdering little girls... I don't like that."" And then just show the killer slowly looking up at the thug, trying his best to compose his fear - and cut! I would have been satisfied with that.

Overall, I really liked this film, but due to it's content, I can't say it's one that I would watch very often.

As far as questionable content:
There are quite a few disturbing images.

I just watch movies because I love movies. I don't care what the critics say including those here. I did miss the beginning of the movie but I saw it online when I ordered it from Amazon. They provided it online for a day. I thought I would have it for 30 days but it was only one day. I found it disturbing because it really gives you a glimpse into the mind of a child serial killer. This man was a neighbor of Susie's. He wasn't a complete stranger so she followed him. What I found disturbing was how this can happen in real life. My grandchildren are in middle school and high school. There is a field between their schools. It isn't nearly as big as the one in the movie but a field never the less. It isn't as isolated as the one in the movie either but it gives me a sense of where this man killed Susie. This could happen in life and it scares me a lot. I always worry about my girls and it makes them nuts. They think nothing bad could happen to them. I don't want them to be afraid of their own shadow but I wish they would be more careful. I don't know if Susie was killed in the field or back at the killers house. The scene in his bathroom makes me think he brought Susie back to his house. My whole point of writing is to say this could happen and people need to be vigilant about their children and the children need to be aware of their surroundings. Think about where you are and what you are doing. Bad things do happen to good people and I don't see this changing any time soon. This is a great movie because I found it so realistic. I read some of the book and I am glad they didn't show the actual rape or murder. This is a child after all. Even on shows like Criminal Minds they don't show the murder of children.

I found the movie fascinating and disturbing. It was the brutal murder of a 14 year old girl. There was nothing beautiful about it. Maybe they were talking about the scenery but I couldn't get the image of this child being lured away and killed. It was amazing though the way they showed her idea of Heaven and her being able to watch her family as they struggle with her death. I watched the trailers and realized I did miss a lot from the beginning. I ordered the DVD and the book. I was able to read several pages of the book online and it goes into much more detail about Susie's murder than the movie showed. I did not know what this man did to her. The ending was kind of poetic justice for the killer but I wish her family would have gotten more closure. Don't want to say to much in case someone reading this and didn't see the movie.

3769068,3,B001QOGYAO,"If you're Peter Jackson, you have what you need to do what you love:  A terrific digital effects company, more oscars than you have fingers, and the motivation to to simultaneously lose fifty pounds while adapting old classics into new ones.

However, before you become an elite, you need to know the feeling of disappointment.  It's happened to the greatest; mediocrity does not discriminate and, for some reason or other, it eventually finds all of us (unless you're a Coen).

That said, for everything going against him - an obscure source material, his inability to learn from his editing mistakes, and a project that grew saturated under overproduction - Jackson could have done far worse.  Financially, he's experiencing his first flop but, as a visionary, it's less of a downhill free fall, and more of a short tumble down the stairs.

Evidence may suggest that Jackson knew the predicament before he even slouched into the director's chair.  Ostensibly, ""The Lovely Bones"" is an example of terrific execution:  Powerful imagery, strong performances, and a good message, all wrapped around an unconventional concept that resonates with children and adults alike.

Unfortunately, some stories simply don't translate well into other mediums.  Although ""Bones"" certainly is of no exception, The issue lies with Jackson's overconfidence in his ability to lather visual wonder over something that is inherently disjointed and anticlimactic.  It works for archetypes like the Ring trilogy; it works for old favorites like Kong; it doesn't work here.

Jacksons' flaws had been obvious for years, but the strengths ultimately offset the glaring flaws.  It's easy to forgive when everything else works so well and, for hopes of not sounding overly critical, ""The Lovely Bones"" is a very good movie.  Its ability to fuse the tangible with the intangible is a joy to watch, and sequences featuring ""the in between"" are breathtaking, even post-Avatar.  You've seen a lot it all before, but not quite like this.

The absurdly awkward pairing of Wahlberg and Weisz notwithstanding, each actor does their best with what they're given.  But the real standout trio is Tucci, Sarandon, and relative newcomer Saoirse Ronan.  Ronan's striking innocence makes her ascent into the supernatural voids compelling, if not entirely heartbreaking, while Sarandon and Tucci, especially,  are absolute revelations.

Nearly undone by the shallow, fractured foundation that lies just underneath the surface, Jackson proves once again that his presence makes things better than they really should be.  Only time will tell precisely when the toothpick breaks the back but, for now, we can all enjoy the director's majestic visions while they last.",1324166400,,2721,5.296037296037296

Didn't the police take fingerprints in the hidey hole? There were certainly enough objects the killer handled there. The other was the heavy safe that took two men to roll ponderously over the ground to the dump. How did the killer get it up (or down for that matter into the underground hole) from the hole, onto his truck in the first place? Where were the brains behind these scenes which were so obviously illogical?  Other than those serious glitches, I applaud Stanley Tucci for his performance. Tucci has played disparate roles in the past as Julia Childs' fond husband, the wardrobe master for Meryl Streep, and was superb in each.

I have to admit to being baffled by the vehemently negative reviews and opinions of this film. I'm not quite sure what the viewers were expecting to see; did not one of them even think of reading the book first? I liked the book and Jackson remained remarkably true to the story, all the way unto its unsatisfying conclusion. But for some reason, while Alice Sebold's book was a bestseller, Peter Jackson's faithful retelling is jeered at. Neither the book nor the film were the best of the best in their respective categories, but for some reason the film gets criticism that the book never has.

As a parent of a teenage daughter the same age as Susie (AND the same age as Jackson's 2 children,) the story was guaranteed to reach me emotionally. It's set in a time when, as implied, missing/abducted children weren't often heard of, certainly not WASPy kids in middle-class suburban neighborhoods. That the Salmons are sitting at dinner, after dark, joking about Susie being so late getting home (while she is being raped and murdered) without really being concerned about where she was or why she's late just wouldn't happen that way today. We are acutely aware these days of the numerous dangers that can happen to kids who might be out and about, alone, for just a weeeeee bit too long. We have ways of keeping in close contact with our older kids (how did parents in previous generations manage without cell phones?) and, for the most part, are able to trace to some degree where they've been and where they're going. (Though they do get clever in their later teens; yes, they most CERTAINLY do.)

The special effects that have become Jackson's trademark are all here. There were lots of CGI scenes of Susie's ""heaven,"" just as there were manymanymany pages in the book devoted to Susie's ""heaven."" The characters are as well-developed in the film as they are in the book. The scenes of agony and grief experienced by Susie's family and friends are just as poignant in the film as they are in the book. The ""ghost story"" aspect of the film is also faithfully told, particularly from the POV of one of her classmates. A couple of the other extraneous storylines from the book have been cut from the film, but I didn't miss them; at its heart it's the same story. Saoirse Ronan is staggeringly good; amazing to watch. If you don't watch it for any other reason, rent it from Netflix and FFWD through all the non-Susie parts to just watch her practice her art (and pick up Atonement, while you're at it.) She's really something special. I like that they chose actors in their mid- to late-30's to play teenage Susie's parents rather than casting middle-aged actors simply because they might look more mature. People married and had kids younger back then than they do now, so for 36- to 37-yo parents to have a 14yo child is perfectly accurate for the time.

Stanley Tucci is also terrifyingly good, but it was hard not to notice the appliance they made him wear in his mouth supposedly, as they explained later, to ""change his jaw line."" I don't understand why they thought that necessary and I don't know why they stuck with it after they began filming. He is never able to talk clearly around it and it becomes distracting any time he speaks more than 2 lines. They could have at least looped much of his dialogue in post. An unnecessary change was Ray Singh's age; in the book, he's Susie's age, a high school freshman, but here he's a senior, which makes his possible infatuation with the still-childlike Susie a little creepy. I can only suppose that they liked the actor so much they decided to change Ray's age from 14 to 17, because Reece Ritchie could not pass for a 14yo boy. Actually, he also looks too old to be 17. I've gone on record elsewhere about my annoyance of actors in their 20's being cast as high school kids. Some do look young enough (Kristen Stewart, Ellen Page) but most don't. Reece Richie is a fabulously attractive guy in his early 20's. And he looks it.

In an odd, rather personal twist, I actually have a definite memory of the ""real"" December 6th, 1973: my parents were splitting up, and that was the very day my mother, myself and my siblings left my dad's house and flew to her parents' house where she grew up.

In the end, I cannot understand what people were expecting from the film that caused them to be so disappointed with the result, particularly if they were familiar with the book. Even now there are the kinds of furious debates raging in various forums about this film that are usually reserved for politically/socially/culturally driven films. It can't be because of the special effects; people flocked in droves to see Avatar, which was NOTHING BUT CGI, and praised it to high heaven (pun not - well, yeah, pun intended, a little) while I barely made it through that film without falling asleep. I get the impression that the negative opinions are some kind of backlash against Peter Jackson, but I can't imagine where that comes from.",1320624000,,5053,4.652855543113102
3769084,5,B001QOGYAO,"SPOILER ALERT ---

Peter Jackson is a wunderkind. Everything that he touches is brilliant. And so it was with Lovely Bones. The movie's lead,Rose McIver, the young Kiwi actress, was brilliant as the innocent girl who was brutally assaulted and murdered by a senseless animal of a man.

What gripped me about the movie was the intertwining of the hereafter and the now and how the twain did meet. Definitely not biblical, but it was an interesting take on the issue and reminded me very much of _The Invisible_ and come to think of it, even of the Sixth Sense, where the dead have a connection with the living - especially those who are attuned to them.

Besides all the creepy stuff, the movie was truly beautiful, in its cinematography and in the wonderful cast who made this - despite it's dark theme - an excellent movie to watch. I'd recommend this movie to all as a precautionary tale about the need for us to be vigilant and to ensure the safety of the frail and the young in our society. I would also recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch a master story-teller (Jackson) tell a memorable story that will stick with you long after the credits roll.",1318896000,2,1166,4.516587677725118
3769085,4,B001QOGYAO,"I'd suspect that anyone viewing this film who has not experienced a tragic and unexpected loss might be more likely to dismiss this as new age folly. I have, unfortunately, been intimately familiar with, and acutely aware of the overwhelming sadness and chaos that this situation can bring. While I won't go into my own detail, I will say that this film hit me so very deeply, in a way that isn't easy to do; there were parts that caused me to weep openly and I understood the dilemma of the dead girl's surviving family.

My slight peeves with the movie... Jackson seems to hang a lot of what are meant to be emotional moments on what I perceived as blank stares. The same long, staring moments that visually punctuated scenes throughout King Kong. It just doesn't do it for me and doesn't seem natural. The moments when the father and sister put two and two together as they converse with the murderer seem strongly acted, however, and were very tense and emotion-filled. The casting of Mark Wahlberg - well, he's never struck me as a really emotional guy and his presence is very flat. There were weird instances in the movie that I don't think I'll ever comprehend...maybe it's a part of the book, not sure as I haven't read it.

A spoiler: the murderer does get his comeuppance, and it struck me not as a just moment, or your standard triumphant Hollywood pinnacle, but a matter-of-fact, zen-like moment, just an event in time. It seemed unlike any story I've ever seen in that sense, and it really was fascinating to watch it unfold.

Not for everyone, but I found it thought-provoking and it filled me with wonder as to why things happen the way they do, and that there are still no easy answers in life.",1318809600,,1711,4.548701298701299

The biggest highlights of the film are the beautiful art direction, wonderfully tacky 70's costumes & the music choices.

Throughout the film, you will be sitting there on your sofa totally amazed and guaranteed to express a TON of emotion such as crying and feeling sympathy, and even wondering yourself whether dying is anything like the way the girl in the film witnesses it.

The special effects showing the magical places in between heaven and life are absolutely *spectacular* and gorgeous, constantly shifting from snowy mountains to beautiful country fields to spectacular lakes and enchanted forests... it's truly a sight to behold and really enhances the story because the atmosphere grabs ahold of your personal inner feelings and refuses to let go.

Whenever the switch occurs from the real world to the pre-heavenly area of land, it's always a wonderful surprise when you're treated to how the girl communicates with, not only some of the people she meets there, but how she tries to reach out to her family. It seriously makes you wonder if any of this can even be possible.

Now the OTHER part of the storyline is the real life situation involving the cops and the girls family trying to track down the killer, who coincidentally happens to live right down the street from the family's home.

3769219,4,B001QOGYAO,"My advice after seeing the movie for the first time was to buy the book and save your money on the movie. This is an okay movie if you watch it not caring that it's not true to the book.  Otherwise it will be a disjointed, disappointing muddle like it was to me.  Maybe if I hadn't read the book first I wouldn't have had any expectations when I finally bought the movie. The book is one of my all-time favorites, a strong storyline that sweeps you through from beginning to end and won't let you put it down, and I expected the movie to be just as riveting and suspenseful. I was disappointed enough to give it 2 stars when I first started this review - somebody took the general idea of the book and rewrote a whole new story which just jumps around with seemingly unrelated scenes that left way too much of the book out to end up even making sense.

I was so confused after the first viewing I had to read the book again (it had been a year) to see what was supposed to have happened.  The biggest gaffe is showing the newspaper clippings of Lindsey through 1977 making her age 4 years BEFORE the bat beating in the cornfield, so you would expect everybody else to age too.  Buckley appears to still be the same kid??  This one little scene messed up the entire timeline. Instead of 4 years later like the movie, the bat beating in the book was only 8 months after the murder.  The body was dumped right away, not at the end like the movie but that wouldn't have made for as much suspense.  The murderer was gone in 1974 one year after Susie's death, he didn't ride away in the sunset like at the end of the movie.  Ray Singh was one year older than Suzie, what was the point of making him a senior?  The book is worthy of a much better movie, I hope to someday see it remade more true to the book.  I did think all the actors were perfect for their roles except Susan Sarandon, she was a jarring note in an otherwise cohesive 'real' cast.  Especially sweet Susie, she is awesome!

After watching the movie two more times to try to judge it on its own merits instead of comparing it to the book, I changed it to 4 stars because of the acting and special effects.  More narration from Susie explaining some of the disjointed scenes to tie them together would have brought it up to 5 stars.",1294012800,,2291,4.212814645308924

Things unfold in a realistic way on the earth plane and she is able to influence this earth plane enough to get resolution and ""let go.""

Visually stunning.  True to form in regards to the afterlife.  Deeply moving for anyone who has faced the loss of a loved one and needed help in letting go.

3769224,4,B001QOGYAO,"I haven't read the book so this critique is based on knowledge of the movie, itself.  Generally speaking, however, it's difficult for a movie to 'live up' to the book on which it was based because 1.  movie scenes are usually more limited than 'scenes' in a book and 2.  books rely on imagination far more than do movies.

With these limitations in mind, I quite enjoyed this surreal and touching movie.  No, it isn't perfect and the story--perhaps necessarily--isn't linear and logical but addresses an extremely painful topic--the serial murder of lovely young people--in as delicate and moving way as may be possible.

I would have given this film a full 5 stars but thought the ending was unnecessarily weak.  Yes, the killer's own death is foreordained in previous scenes but I, at least, would have preferred the satisfaction of vengeful temporal justice.",1291593600,,861,4.9375
3769225,2,B001QOGYAO,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

The 'Lovely Bones' reminds me of the film 'Ghost' in that the protagonist has been murdered and now exists in a limbo-like nether world. In both films, the protagonist has 'unfinished business' not only in terms of resolving conflict with a principal love interest but also ensuring that the person who murdered them gets his just desserts.

In Ghost, Patrick Swayze's 'Sam Wheat' is tormented by the fact that he never told girlfriend Molly that he loved her. He gets that opportunity at the end of the film when he inhabits the body of Oda Mae Brown, a spiritualist. Similarly, in the The Lovely Bones, Susie Salmon is tormented by the fact that she never got that first teenage kiss from Ray Singh, her handsome Anglo-Indian high school chum. Susie also gets to inhabit someone else's body, in this case Ruth Connors, a neighborhood girl who also possesses psychic powers. But whereas the relationship between Sam and Mollie is decidedly developed and resolved in a quite satisfying manner, the resolution of Susie's angst over the missed kiss is nothing more than mere puppy love.

Ghost is also far more satisfying in terms of drama since Sam actively pursues his killer by tormenting him through various means including levitating inanimate objects in his direction . He also communicates with the living, aided by his trusted ally, Oda Mae. Susie, on the other hand, can do little to bother her murderer, George Harvey (the twisted serial killer, well-played by Stanley Tucci). Occasionally she startles him (he catches a glimpse of a shadow inside his garage which appears to be that of Susie riding her bicycle). And when Susie finally does get the opportunity to communicate with Ray, instead of telling him to warn her parents about Harvey, she is merely content to obtain the kiss she missed out on before she was murdered.

Susie is truly stuck in limbo since she has no external arc to resolve. Her conflicts are not with the survivors on earth but within her own mind. In addition to obtaining the kiss from Ray, she also must face the reality of the nature of her demise. Director Peter Jackson pulls out all the stops with his CGI effects, depicting Susie's gradual triumph over her own fears, taking in the history of Harvey's murderous forays. Jackson is perhaps most creative when he offers up the nightmare scene (a la Stephen King) where Susie learns of the fate of each of Harvey's victims.

Even if one is impressed with all those beautiful special effects in the nether world, the machinations back on earth are strictly soap opera. There is not enough space to catalog the absurdities of the Lovely Bones plot, but I'll mention a few here: 1) Instead of phoning the police, 14 year old Susie, who obviously doesn't know how to drive, plays hero by driving her brother, a choking victim, to the hospital; 2) Harvey constructs an underground den in a clear field and no one notices what he's doing 3) Susie is missing a scant few hours but instead of waiting for the police, her father runs outside, hands out flyers like an idiot, believing that somehow that's the best strategy for finding his missing daughter; 4) Susie's father, who has been hounding the investigating detective for not doing a good enough job in finding his daughter, delays the investigation by not developing all of Susie's film all at once. Instead, he wants to 'honor her memory' by developing one roll each month at a time; 5) Instead of staying with her children like a normal mother, Susie's mother, Abigail, abandons the family and goes off to pick fruit on a fruit farm; 6) Grandma Lynn (played by an over the top Susan Sarandon), can think of nothing better to do but drink copious amounts of alcohol while the family needs a strong parental figure to hold things together; 7) Susie's vigilante Dad goes after Harvey with a baseball bat despite having no evidence whatsoever (except a hunch) that he's responsible for his daughter's murder; 8) Harvey somehow loads that heavy safe into his car and makes a fast getaway but later can barely drag the safe with the help of another man a few yards, where he finally disposes of it in a ditch.

Perhaps the most ludicrous part of the plot is sister Lindsey's decision to break into Harvey's house where she finds the incriminating journal. How can Detective Fenerman possibly go after Harvey since the evidence was obtained illegally? After learning that Lindsey had broken into Harvey's house, wouldn't he have been obligated to arrest her? And wouldn't the journal have been inadmissible evidence in a court of law? Certainly no Judge would have given Detective Fenerman a search warrant to enter Harvey's house on the basis of illegally obtained evidence!

In the end, The Lovely Bones has the dubious distinction of turning the story of the murder of a 14 year old girl into a comforting tale of reassurance. The full horror of the murder itself is reduced to a series of creepy Stephen King-like horror scenes and the victim somehow 'triumphs' when she finds the courage (in an illusory limbo) to overcome her fears at looking at the reality of her demise.

Further reassurance comes in the form of a comeuppance for the evil serial killer. Unlike the book where the killer is not apprehended, nature (or even God perhaps) conveniently has an icicle drop on the shoulder of the villain, where he is promptly dispatched by falling over the side of a cliff.

Despite the clever special effects, for those who are not completely convinced of the overall ludicrousness of this flick, please consult the IMDb message board under the topic, ""100 things we've learned from the Lovely Bones Movie"". It's a thread that should leave you in stitches!",1291507200,2,5738,4.805471124620061
3769226,1,B001QOGYAO,"I really wanted to like this movie as a shared experience with my S.O., but except for Stanley Tucci's outstanding performance, this piece is an unmitigated mess. The writing is long-winded, meandering, and requires a complete suspension of disbelief. Pass on this one, any other use of your two hours would be an improvement.",1290902400,2,326,5.055555555555555
3769227,4,B001QOGYAO,"This film was very heavy. In an age where children turn up missing every day and many are found slain in the most heinous ways, ""The Lovely Bones"" is remarkable in that it has the courage to tackle such a difficult subject that most people would rather pretend wasn't part of the real world. Unfortunately, it IS a part of the real world. This film, while well-made and effective in its own way, suffers from some flaws that I feel could have made this film even better and perhaps even Oscar worthy.

Such a subject is almost impossible to explore when trying to secure a ""PG13"" rating. These days, big films studios and big name directors try to water down films as much as they can to secure a rating which will allow anyone admission to see it. And guess what their motivation is? Yeah, that's right ($$$$). Even with its ""PG13"" rating, I don't think this is a film most kids are going to be totally wanting to see anyway. And had Peter Jackson not been the director of this film, it may have been treated with the dignity that Sebold's novel deserves. Ryan Gosling was originally attached to play the father in the film (Mark Wahlberg's character), but left due to creative differences with Jackson. It is clear that Jackson has his own (lighthearted) interpretation of Sebold's novel and that is fine. It's just not as effective as it should have been. And because of this, I think the film suffers. Which is tragic, because in its own way, the film is very beautiful and goes to such a ""height""... but it never quite makes it to the summit.

Why is Susan Sarandon in this film? Out of ALL the middle aged actresses in the world, Jackson selects Sarandon to be the grandmother. Instant killer for me. Love her or hate her, she doesn't belong here and her presence immediately sets the film off balance. Maybe Sigourney Weaver or Meryl Streep? I don't know... but not Sarandon. Mark Wahlberg was great in the role as the father, though he may not have been my first choice. Stanley Tucci's performance is nothing short of AMAZING here, what a fine actor and an excellent choice in casting. His Oscar nod was well deserved.

Finally, the afterlife sequences. Most of these sequences were breathtakingly beautiful, however, there were a few in there that were just ridiculous and further depreciated the effect of what was the matter at hand. I understand that the central character is a very young girl, but some of these sequences were too silly for me. I don't know, I guess the world has made me hard. Giggling and playfulness just doesn't seem to belong here. Aside from these few sequences, the vast majority of the afterlife sequences will make your eyes water.

All in all, this was an interesting take on Sebold's novel. It's a film that you will either accept or reject depending on your individual beliefs and ideals. With the exception of the ""keeping it safe"" approach to secure a ""PG13"" rating, Susan Sarandon's unbecoming presence and some of the silliness in the afterlife sequences; I accepted this film.

The first half hour starts off quickly and you become involved in the story with a stunning amount of dread Ive not felt with any recent film Ive seen in several years.

When you realize she has been killed and is in a netherworld, thats when the pace starts to break down.  It seems that Mr Spielberg got carried away as producer and added too much visual eye candy in this netherworld of the little victim.  I know he wanted to soften the blow of her death but all it does is confuse the message of how evil can destroy our lives on this earth.

The film has some high notes until the end but it continues to drag out with more confusing messages that try to make it sound like the murderer is ok and besides we all die sooner or later anyhow!  HOGWASH  I say he deserved to be doled out the same cruel death he gave to the little girl.  Until we face the fact that evil must be dealt with, it will continue to flourish.

The imagery was perfect.  The movie's dreamy sequences pulled me in completely.  I was heartbroken when I saw that this movie received poor reviews, and even more saddened when I found it to be absent on DVD shelves everywhere I searched.

I guess as a mother, this movie might have more emotional impact on me as opposed to someone who isn't a parent. Also, I want to mention, I have not read the book (but now will). The main character, Susie Salmon was superbly acted by Saoirse Ronan. She really made me feel every emotion. I felt the effervescence of youth, remembering those feelings of being 14 and admiring a boy....I also felt the fear and gut-wrenching anguish Susie felt and the sadness...I really was so sad and could feel the pain. I thought the whole cast was stellar and perfectly cast. One message I think I got from this movie was how much you take for granted. Susie missed her first kiss....makes you wonder how something that seems trivial as an adult (now), how much would most of us would have regretted not having that experience in our youth? I would definitely watch this movie again, it was mesmerizing and I couldn't not watch it.

3769253,4,B001QOGYAO,"Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan) is the fourteen year old heroine of the unusual, moving film. She is killed by a neighborhood predator after being lured into his secret lair.

At first, Susie is not aware that she's dead. She comes to a slow realization of this fact as she is drawn deeper into the world she now inhabits, a fantastic, seemingly perfect Limbo, where she is awed and moved by the otherworldly sights she sees.

She is alternately terrified by her own dawning awareness of her hideous murder. She can also see the world and life she has left behind, and is deeply saddened by the agony her family suffers in her absence.

THE LOVELY BONES is deeply spiritual, and deeply engaging, but it is also deeply disturbing. It is a thought-provoking film, with a great many strengths, not least of which is the coltishly pretty, ethereal Ms. Ronan in the lead, who carries this difficult role very confidently on her young shoulders.

This was Peter Jackson's ""art"" film, a film he could only create after his spectacular commercial success with THE LORD OF THE RINGS. THE LOVELY BONES, surprisingly, has some elements in common with the trilogy. It's depiction of ""heaven"" is a bright, calm pastoral fantasy, punctuated by the darkness and fear of the murder scenes.

THE LOVELY BONES is the type of film that stays with you after even one viewing. It, however, lacks the kind of ""entertainment value"" which causes people to buy DVDs. Very few people will say to the family, ""Hey! Let's watch that movie about the murdered girl again tonight! Anybody up for it?"" though it might be the kind of film a family coping with loss might watch for comfort and openhearted communication.",1288224000,3,1683,4.769759450171821
3769254,3,B001QOGYAO,"The shortcomings of this film were a bitter pill, when it had such rich material to work with from the book.  What should have been compelling and visually stunning commentary on soul healing and  bonds strengthened across the veil ended up confused communication and a disempowering and dissatisfactory question of how the story resolved.  The film split between the story of Susie Salmon's family after her rape and murder, and Susie's reticent experience of moving on in the afterlife.  For the most part the scenes of her family's life after her death were solid, except for the places where Susie intervened and touched their lives.  There was definitely an emphasis on sentiment in those moments, forsaking continuity and smooth delivery of the story.  The scenes of Susie in the afterlife were pretty but light.  They did not move the plot as they should have, which for someone who hadn't read the book would make them completely pointless.

The fact that they chose to keep the film PG13 when dealing with child rape is telling in and of itself.  Often the decision to reach a wider audience kills a film's deeper allure, and this one is a perfect example.  Indeed, child rape is hinted at, but the fact that many nongraphic, yet revealing details of Susie's murder, thus of Mr. Harvey, are left out, the significance of her story and experience are diminished.  In fact, I don't recall the word rape ever being used in the film. This is highly relevant info that shouldn't have been muted, and not naming it exactly what it was is an insult to what Susie endured.  That omission doesn't allow enough of a picture of what Mr. Harvey truly was.  Susie gets a glimpse of it in her discovery of his murder of other girls, but Susie's experience is handled so carefully that the impact of it becomes dulled.  Had the foil of Susie's observation of  her peers going through the luxury of puberty been sustained through the film as it was in the book,  the breakdown between events in her family's life after her death and Susie's experience in the afterlife would have been clearer in the film.  She wasn't just seeking the end of Mr. Harvey, she was seeking peace in the tragic loss of her own selfhood.  This message is thinly veiled alongside the references of her being 'Daddy's girl,' and her resistance to completely move over for her family's peace.

Susan Sarandon was the stand out talent in this film.  Tucci's Mr. Harvey was impeccably cringeworthy.  In the end, the film was overall very well acted and even directed.  The final edit detracted from both of those accomplishments significantly.",1287532800,,2609,4.776785714285714

Oh man! What a complete freakin' trainwreck. If you are even vaugely considering watching this movie, do something far more constructive with your time instead like ripping your eyeballs from their sockets and shoving pencils deep into your ears. Here's a helpful hint: Start with the pencils-in-the-ears part because if you yank out your peepers first, trust me, you're gonna have major trouble locating those pencils. And believe me, doing those things would be time much better spent than watching this one-hundred-million-dollars-to-make abomination of a movie. Either the book is good or the book sucks but hey, I'll never know because I'll never read it. These days, amidst cascading foreclosure numbers, raging unemployment rates and plummeting property values, why would I want to spend what little time I have for entertainment being bummed out reading about child rape, murder and dismemberment? I wouldn't. No one in their right mind WOULD. I'm already bummed out enough. You probably are too. Whether the book sucks or not, the movie most definitely does. It's slow, plodding and ponderous. It's a tragedy. It's a comedy. It's a music video. It's all of the above. It's none of the above. And when the ""comedic"", flash-cut sequence of a loaded Susan Sarandon knocking back tumblers of brown liquor and puffing away on long-ash cigarrettes like a buzzing tweaker came on the screen, it was so far out of place that I thought my dog had sat upon the remote control and had accidently changed the channel, I am absolutely serious. It's an indulgent waste of time, money, special effects and film stock; a total mess. There were characters whose actions and inactions were so stupid, so completely brainless that they made me wince repeatedly, embarrassed not only for the writers, the actors and the director but for myself as well for actually sitting all the way through this complete caca-fest. And oh yeah, there are muliple plot holes so big you could drive a fleet of jumbo jets filled with locomotives through them. I could go on but what's the point? Do not watch the movie. Don't read the book. Just answer me this: How many great, small or independent films could have been made with the massive amount of cash that was wastefully shoveled into this gaping sinkhole of a film?

However, the book is rather heavy on content, and this is understandable. Go into this movie with an open mind, ready to be easily pleased by things other than an engaging drama. The visual effects are top-notch, and that is part of what made the movie for me, personally. At some points, it's almost like watching a lesser Avatar. The story, although somewhat convoluted, still manages to work and does pull the viewer in at some points, sometimes not others.

3769270,2,B001QOGYAO,"Because of its gruesome title, I wasn't interested in this story until I found out it was about a murdered 14-year-old girl making contact with her father from beyond the grave.  Traces of morbid elements don't excite me, but bate a bleak title with eerie connections, and I'm hooked.

It was this attraction that drew me to the book, which I was fortunate enough to have read before viewing the film, which fared miserably in comparison.  Like most screen-play adaptations dealing with complex emotions and deep thought processes, the movie needed to plot its action scenes and dialog carefully.  This movie was especially challenged because it needed to convey a long-term healing process within one sitting, but instead of using its time wisely, character development was lost to over-indulged, super-surreal images of heaven that did nothing to transcend Susie's story or that of her grieving family.

Like the book, the movie reeled me in quickly as the horror, suspense, and tragedy of Susie's death was totally real and heartbreaking.  But this hold gradually lost its grip as the story unwound.

While the movie effectively conveyed the need for both the living and dead to move on, Susie's father was the only fully developed and painfully tortured character.  Susie's mother appears more sympathetic on screen than she did in writing, but her need to leave was not felt, and her departure seemed more like weeks than years.

There was no secret as to who killed Susie, but we learn little else about this man other than the fact that he killed before and builds dollhouses.  But Susie's connection to the other victims was portrayed mainly in the afterlife, and the dollhouses themselves reveal nothing about their builder.  It would have been so much more interesting if a subtle but vital clue was discovered in one of the miniature houses.

But the most under-developed characters were Susie's sister Lindsay and Susie's former classmate Ruth.  Slightly rebellious and highly suspicious, Lindsay was the sister who was left to grow up, but we miss out on a lot from the time she receives a friendship necklace from a boy to when she's seen pregnant at the film's conclusion.

Gone were the camp scenes which would have drawn more attention to Ruth, who was obsessed with Susie's death and her images of souls wondering the earth.  The book provided the camp for academically-enriched students like Lindsay and Ruth to draw a comparison to a contest to depict the perfect murder to the ironic way Susie's non-captured killer was finally brought to justice.  The absence of these scenes was also a missed opportunity for a bit of comic relief among young people in an awkward situation.

Ruth's growing friendship with Susie's boyfriend Ray was also under-developed, and again the passage of time was lost.  And while we see Susie using Ruth's body to make one last physical connection to Ray, unlike Whoopi Goldberg in Ghost, Ruth's role as a medium was more like an afterthought thrown in to conveniently wrap up the story and send Susie on her way.

Those who read the book are likely to be disappointed in the gaps the movie left open.  And those who didn't read it are likely to feel let down from the initial momentum provided in the early scenes.",1285632000,,3264,4.8892921960072595
3769271,4,B001QOGYAO,"Peter Jackson does Hitchcock, and then some.

What makes this interpretation of the Sebold novel so memorable is
his signal sensitivity for the subject - the butchered life of a teenage girl.
I suspect that this is secretly Jackson's Zodiac: a loving revisitation to his
70's adolesence - complete with period psycho killer.

I confess I never thought I would have much enthusiasm for a story
that was once an Oprah Book Club pick-of-the-month, or whatever,
However, I found this to be one of the rare movies I have seen in quite
a while that, fittingly, refused to be forgotten; that haunted.

Some of the many reasons why:

Brian Eno.  His contribution to the soundtrack as well as many of the
sound effects is subliminal, simple, perfection.
Andrew Lesnie's lensing: recreating the overexposure, graininess
and gold/blue contrasts of period film stocks and which
always accentuates the choices of the art direction.
Saoirse Ronan.  Aside from facial expressivness, the true test of a actor
is the ability to convey voice-over narration convincingly. This young lady
should have a long and happy career ahead of her.
Last, but not least, Stanley Tucci.  A thankless role for sure, but one
which rivals Perkins' Norman Bates.(I suspect Jackson realised this inevitable
comparison, particularly during the cleanup scene.)  And please don't squeeze
me for suggesting, but I also suspect there is a sly and twisted
resemblance to a certain TV commercial character from the past:
check the name on the street sign in the shot when Harvey is returning home.

All this, along with some superb editing (By itself, the scene of Lindsay's
intrusion and escape from the Harvey house deserves close and repeat study),
as well as beautifully masterful interweaving of imagery,
much of which is only apparent and truly meaningful after repeat viewings,
frees The Lovely Bones from most of its defects.

But most importantly and evocatively of all, this is a movie that pays long
overdue respect and tribute to those who are so often neglected and treated
like mere statistical news fodder - even worse, the consequence of some creep's
""disadvantaged"" past.

As much as we would prefer to look away, the children who are victims
of the cruelest fate must always be remembered.  In some small yet
significant way this movie provides an eloquent elegy for their loss.",1285459200,3,2352,5.033505154639175

Here is what I liked: the acting is good, especially Saoirse Ronan, and the way in which Suzie's heaven is portrayed I think in ways that enhance that aspect of the novel.

Once again, however, Peter Jackson shows a lack of judgment in relation to tone and editing. The soundtrack is often jarring, whith 70's rock infused at moments which should be moving, or at least not play like something from VH1's ""I Love the 70s"" (though I have to admit it was kind of cool hearing some Brian Eno in a major studio film). No spoiler here, just an inconsequential example: one sequence has the grandmother running round doing chores etc. while the soundtrack blares a rocknroll song from the era, with the whole sequence edited like a bad sitcom or a lame Disney movie montage. Jackson's inability to maintain a consistent and appropriate tone ruins what had the potential to be a classic. I also think there are moments of less consequence (plot-wise, character-wise) which could have been edited down in favor of developing more important items; for example, the interplay between Suzie and her sister, an important aspect of the  novel, is all but lost as too much time is spent showing the killer's POV.

A movie can never be as complex and thought provoking as the novel it is based on; but the message of both came through clearly; namely that out of tragedy, violence and horror, can come not only healing, but a transcendant spiritual triumph as well. Susan Sarandon's portrayal of the grandmother gave a touch of comic relief, perhaps to reminder that life always goes on, in bumpy uneven ways.

3769277,4,B001QOGYAO,"""The Lovely Bones"" is based on Alice Sebold's hugely popular 2002 novel of the same title. Like almost all adaptations it takes some liberties with the source novel's story, but I think it manages to preserve the essence; so that you feel the story more even if you do not understand it as precisely. Unfortunately most of the comments and reviews are rather useless for anyone thinking about viewing the film or for someone looking to better understand what they just viewed. So here are a few random points to consider.

  The film is basically a blend of ""The Dust Factory"" (2004) and ""Speak"" (2004); with elements of ""Silent Hill"" (2006) and ""What Dreams May Come"" (1998). If you like that type of stuff you should get off on ""The Lovely Bones"". If this sort of story is not your cup-of-tea there is still enough quality acting and imagery to make it time well spent for a technical film buff.

  As in the novel, the entire story is told from the point-of-view (POV) of 14-year-old Susie Salmon who became the victim of a serial killer. The main character tells her story in flashbacks and subdued voice-over, as she observes the world from a personalized transitional realm between earth and heaven. Looking into the world much like the penguin in the family's snow globe, as her grieving family tries to cope with her death and her brazen killer goes largely unnoticed.

  The distanced voice-over gives Susie more dimensionality; her calm tone is often contradicted by what is happening in the frame and it contrasts nicely with the shallow (but normal) teen qualities of her character before death. ""Depth"" is an important symbolic element in the story, which is full of juxtapositions between closed places (sinkholes, basement, a compartment under the floorboards, dollhouses, ships in bottles) and bucolic vistas. There is an especially effective montage early in the film as the editor cuts back and forth between the trapped Susie and her unsuspecting family at the dinner table; with each cut Susie looks smaller and younger.

  ""Atonement's"" Saoirse Ronan plays Susie, and her subtly expressive performance elevates the film to ""must see"" status. A young actor this instinctively talented and effortlessly charming only comes along about once in a decade, and rarely are they matched with a role this perfect for them at a particular point in their careers. Ronan should have a lengthy and very successful acting career but it is unlikely that she will again play a character that is such a perfect physical and emotional fit. For serious film buffs this is one of those historical moments.

  Ronan's performance transcends the genre, unexpectedly causing the film to work as a very affecting coming-of-age story. Susie clings to a living world that is lost to her in much the same way that Georgia Lass did in the ""Dead Like Me"" series, and in the process experiences things that positively change her, even after her death. Allowing her to reconcile things and to even appreciate ""the lovely bones that had grown around my absence"" as she comes to terms with ""the world without me in it"".

  Director Peter Jackson chooses to emphasize her in-between world with a lot of expressionistic special effects visuals. While this was not a point of emphasis in Sebold's novel, film is a visual medium and these provide an opportunity to introduce symbolic connections between the two worlds and to showcase Susie's journey. Even more importantly, Jackson nicely fills the frame with Susie's innocent features as she bravely navigates her strange land with looks of wonder and on occasion looks of terror. Using a 14-year-old girl amplifies the emotional power of this stuff, it simply would not have been as effective with someone a different age.  Lurking beneath his psychological thriller storyline, Jackson steers the film toward a rather deep allegorical take on an existential theme. It explores the isolation of someone as they realize that they no longer belong in the world.

  I am not a Peter Jackson fan; his films, from minimalist efforts like ""Heavenly Creatures"" to exercises in excess like ""King Kong"", have never really connected with me. And he was probably not the ideal choice for a film like ""The Lovely Bones"".  But his only real misstep here, the insertion of Susan Sarandon's comically overplayed grandmother into the middle of the story, was not significant enough to be a fatal flaw. And another director might not have chosen to emphasize the process of Susie growing stronger, which I found to be the most appropriate emphasis for a ""practical"" adaptation of the original story.

  Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1281225600,2,4667,4.9512820512820515
3769278,2,B001QOGYAO,"The Lovely Bones, is a book written by Alice Sebold back in 2002. A book which caused much controversy over its subject matter of rape,and murder and its aftermath on a family and community. Its also a book that is much loved by its fans and I have to say that when I read it one of the first things that popped into my head when I finished it was ""This will be a hard book to turn into a movie"" and I was right.

I was wrong.

The movie sets looked good, I really got that ""we are in the 70's"" vibe from it. Outfits, houses, knick knacks, hairstyles, cars, posters on the walls, it all gave us a good solid place to start from. It was cast pretty good as well, Mark Wahlberg belongs in that era for sure. Susie Salmon played by Saoirse Ronan can carry a drama as we have seen in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Atonement-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B0013XZ6X4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Atonement (Widescreen Edition)</a>, and the rest of the cast was adequate. Too bad that none of them really needed to have any acting skills, because Peter Jackson didn't write a movie that required them.
All the skills needed was a good set designer, hair and makeup and CGI expertise.

This movie basically just took the story from the book, barely touched on the good parts or left them out all together, and then expected us to connect some dots that were never on the same page at the same time. Even if you had never read the book, you would leave feeling like something was missing. There was no character development, no crafting of the sense of Susie and her family and what they meant to eachother. There was no descriptions of the community in which this horrible crime took place, or any in depth look at the investigation itself! The scene where her mom and dad are in bed and crying about how she is gone forever...flat and deviod of any real emotions. We aren't shown how this affected this family except for the father breaking his ships in a bottle and even that was empty.

The Lovely Bones needed to be made into a movie, but it should have been done ina way where it honored the book and how powerful it was. This version, didnt. I cannot recommend this to any fan of the book, or even someone looking for a dramatic movie to watch.

a reviewer from [..] said it best ""The Lovely Bones is pretty much what I anticipated from the director of an epic trilogy of plus-sized fantasy flicks and an oversized remake of a classic, lean thriller. Jackson is so in love with the material and the premise that he can't resist expanding upon its themes, conflating them with his own ideas on grief, mortality, and the rich fantasy life of teenage girls. The film veers uneasily between entrancing poetry and wrongheaded melodrama, stopping along the way for left-field slapstick and old school cheap thrills""",1280966400,5,4080,5.118618618618618
3769299,4,B001QOGYAO,"""The Lovely Bones"" is Peter Jackson's visionary adaptation of the bestselling novel by Alice Sebold.  Sebold's audacious conceit was to have her story told from the viewpoint of a 14-year-old girl (touchingly portrayed by Saoirse Ronan) who has just been kidnapped and murdered by the neighborhood pedophile (the movie takes place in early 1970s suburbia).  Susie's adventures in the afterlife are placed in direct apposition to a family's inconsolable grief, their attempts to come to terms with an unimaginable loss, and the efforts on the part of local law enforcement to bring her killer (creepily played by Stanley Tucci) to justice.  And what role, if any, can Susie herself play in effecting such an outcome from her place in the great beyond?

There are those who will balk at the undeniably morbid nature of the material - and, indeed there are times when the why and the wherefore of it all seems as elusive to the storytellers as it is to the audience (the script was written by Fran Wa, Philippa Boyens and Jackson).  Still, this is a technically accomplished, visually stunning, and eerily mesmerizing melding of the worldly with the otherworldly, as Susie and her father (Mark Wahlberg) both learn the importance of letting go and moving on.

In his direction, Jackson flows seamlessly between the dual ""realities,"" refusing to set up clear lines of demarcation between the two.  The result is a fluid work that feels all of a piece - one that rarely jars us with gear-grinding tonal shifts or heavy-handed transitions.  Moreover, the mood is greatly enhanced and sustained by Brian Eno's haunting and ethereal score.

All in all, a stylish and engrossing film.",1280880000,,1675,4.996402877697841

It would have been better had Spielberg and Jackson given the movie a different title.  The book, while not great, is a very good story.

3769334,3,B001QOGYAO,"Adapted from the Alice Sebold novel, The Lovely Bones is directed by The Lord Of The Rings' Peter Jackson. It tells the story of a young girl who is raped and killed, and who finds herself in some kind of netherworld, looking down and seeing how the events of her death unravel. She wills her father and sister to find her killer, and watches on as her murderer plans more attacks. She sees her family fall apart, as she in turns struggles to move on and truly find peace in the afterworld.

First of all, let me say that I am a huge fan of Peter Jackson. What he did with the Lord Of The Rings trilogy is an absolute masterstroke. Unfortunately, since then he has seemingly been given too much time and money to indulge himself. Hence, his subsequent movies have been overlong and bloated. This movie had a very interesting premise, a great cast, and an award-winning team at the helm. Why then is it such a complete mess? There is no cohesion- it is tonally all over the place, and complete scenes seem so jarring and misjudged that they completely throw the film out of sync. It seems that Peter Jackson wasn't quite sure what approach he wanted to take with the film, and as a result he ended up going in a myriad of different directions. What is really annoying though is that there are glimpses here of how good a film this could have been.

I won't spoil the plot here for the uninitiated, but I do have to mention the awful scenes played for comedic effect in the middle of the movie. Susan Sarandon's character is woefully misplaced here. She comes in and does what is essentially a comedy routine in the middle of what is supposed to be a gripping and involving drama. I also have to mention the terrible CGI elements of the purgatory that the young girl finds herself in. Did Jackson dedicate so much of the film to those scenes simply because he has the Weta Digital team at his disposal and wanted to give them all something to do? If so, it was a bad mistake. The CGI here is shockingly bad in parts, which is a huge surprise after all the wonderful work they did on LOTR and King Kong.

There are so many things about this movie that didn't work, that you could write a whole thesis on it. All of which begs the question- how did Peter Jackson drop the ball so badly? Maybe it's time he was reined in a little, and didn't surround himself with yes men. If he is allowed to continue like this, he will surely become the next George Lucas- and that's no good thing.

If it sounds like I hated this movie then I can assure you that that isn't the case. It was intriguing and involving at times. I liked a lot of things about it, such as Mark Wahlberg's performance as the grieving father. I loved some of the inventive ways in which the film was shot, and whole scenes had me mesmerized. The score was beautiful and the look of the film is terrific, if somewhat inconsistent. The problem is that all the good work is undone when you consider how great actors are given nothing to do for large chunks of the film. I haven't read the book, but it would appear that there are a lot more interesting things going on that the film completely ignores.

So, all in all this is an overlong and ambitious mess. I do hope Peter Jackson can return to past glories and deliver better things than this in the future. Lord knows he has the talent and the dedication to deliver fantastic films. Unfortunately this is the nadir of a wonderful career so far.",1278288000,2,3453,4.347286821705427

The book by Alice Seebold was good, not fantastic, but a solid, well written little drama about coping with the loss of a child. The twist being that the murdered child looks on from her in-between heaven above. The strength of the book clearly lies in the strong characters, the human emotion and the genuine interaction betweeen the remaining family members. This is totally skipped in the movie. It is af if Peter Jackson chooses a few dramatic highlights and forgets everything in between. It seems horribly shallow and the poor actors Mark Wahlberg, Susan Sarandon and Rachel Weisz are left with almost ""half-roles"" - cause people will be wondering why the hell they're doing what they do. Now of course it could be that half the movie ended up on the cutting floor, but then again director Peter Jackson obviously has enough minutes to fill with an absolutely obnoxious cgi-heaven consisting of big pink roses, purple skies and stuff that looks like it would have fit better in a Narnia-movie. Jackson used to be really good at directing ""smaller"" things - think ""Heavenly Creatures"" and ""The Frighteners"". Now I just think he should stick to big productions with thousands of trolls.

3769359,4,B001QOGYAO,"_Lovely Bones_ (2010) is a fairly good movie about a horrible tragedy and the afterlife.  The movie features very vivid and impressive scenes of the afterlife.  The movie involves a young girl whose life is brutally taken by a serial killer and the attempt to right the wrong of this great evil.  The girl becomes a ghost trapped in a purgatory between here and there until her soul and remains are laid to rest.  The film shows the struggles of her family to come to terms with her brutal murder (although the reactions of some of the family members seem somewhat superficial, particularly the grandmother).  The girl exists as a ghost in a beautiful and lush paradise along with the souls of those who were also killed by this evil man.  Ultimately, after much ordeal the father comes to suspect the real killer and attempts to bring him to justice because the police no longer take the situation seriously.  The sister of the girl sneaks into his house and discovers a lock of hair from her sister and thus attains the necessary ""evidence"" the family so strongly desires.  However, before the police can arrive the killer manages to escape just before he tosses the remains of the girl into a sinkhole where she can be buried forever.  I felt it was unfortunate however that in the end the killer will not have to face the justice of man but only falls prey to a sort of cosmic justice (and presumably justice in the afterlife).  The movie features beautiful scenes and imagery and shows us a view of the afterlife that is perhaps different from what some have come to expect.  I felt it was a good film but very brutal and depressing, though in the end the wrong appears to be righted (somehow).",1277510400,,1699,4.574257425742574

I think this would have been a better story if it had just focused on the family dealing with the death of a child ,sans the big color trip..  The villian was very unbelievable. The ending was a big let down. Susan Sarandon's role was weird.  Not really sure why her character was involved.

3769361,4,B001QOGYAO,"Having read the book and not thinking much of that, I decided to rent the Peter Jackson film of the same name, The Lovely Bones.  I was surprised how Jackson cut out a lot of the stuff I did not like about the book and kept in the important parts I did like.

Susie is a bright, happy and creative girl who gets lured into a pit by Mr. Harvey.  Though not shown at the start of the film, he kills her.  And as in the book, Susie runs and touches the strange girl Ruth before Susie goes off into the unknown.

And as in the book, her mother can't cope and eventually abandons her family and goes off to California.  The book though got deep into mom's feelings and heartbreak which are merely touched on in the film.

Another aspect of the book I did not like was the concentration on the people in Susie's former life to a point of exhaustion.  Yes, they're getting on with it, but there is next to nothing being done about getting the murderer.  With the book, I was expecting more of a murder mystery and got too much soap in my soap opera.

With Jackson's film, he at least pouts more emphasis into the dark soul that is Mr. Harvey.  The deep shadows the fear, despair and desire are prominent in all dealings with this guy.

The ""In Between"" area where Susie is hanging is misunderstood by some critics of the film.  She is not in heaven.  She's in a Purgatory of sorts.  I do agree with critics though in the light and airiness of her life off earth -- too unrealistically happy and cheerful soon after being raped and chopped up.  Wouldn't happen.

The book explores a lot into her former relation with Ray, which was just getting started.  In the film, his family, the accusation that he may be ""the one"" and so on are not explored at all --- and that's OK with me!  Too much exposition was in the book to a point of boredom and ""let's get on with it"" from me to author Seybold.

Comedy relief with the mother-in-law, the drinking & smoking, the 70s music and her getting her nails done by her 8 year old grandson are priceless, silly and cute.  The cuteness doesn't last long in this film, however.

Blue Horizon: it changes and grows with her emotions and realizations and her obsession with her family.  She knew that her father would never give her up.  ""He loved me as much as he could -- I had to let him go.""  Wow, what a switch!

Moments like this, such as the crumbling gazebo as she realizes she needs to let him go are particularly poignant.

Going over the dead of Harvey's victims is pretty gruesome, but again the book did not delve much into it.

[Spoiler]

The film does what I wanted the book to do, to concentrate on the murder, the evil behind Harvey and really solving the crime (rather than taking over Ruth's body and having sex with Ray -- which the movie does anyway!  Seriously, why doesn't Susie say who her murderer is rather than take over Ruth's body to get a kiss??  Oh brother).

[End Spoiler]

The whole touchy-feely stuff with the former victims all  happy in the Blue Horizon with Susie was something out of the Sixties, all the moody music and harp music, didn't do much for the story nor for me.  Happy and beautiful rape & murder victims?  Nah....

I do enjoy Jackson's way with making the slightest motion increase abnormally or making scenes unusually bright or dark pitch to represent mood and ""flavor"" of the film.  Occasional tense moments such as Susie's sister sneaking into Harvey's house to get evidence of her sister's murder is intense and has you on your seat's edge!

Bottom Line:

Overall, not a bad film.  Certainly not Peter Jackson's best, but as book adaptations go, not too bad.  The book suffered from too much secondary characterization and padding and Jackson cut all that out.  The ending he kept (unfortunately).  The ""In Between"" Blue Horizon of the spirit world was a bit too happy and light considering it was made up of murder and rape victims!

Recommended for those who've read the book.  And the Sixties guitar ballads are tolerable!

3769366,5,B001QOGYAO,"I know this movie has taken a big hit, so I wasn't expecting too much at all.  I had read the book, but that was 8 years ago and I really didn't remember all the details, so I can't even comment on how far it strayed from the authors version.  I in no way think the book has to be read to enjoy the movie.
  I was very glad the movie didn't not go into great detail about Suzie's demise, my 14 year old daughter wanted to watch the movie very much, and she wouldn't need to see all that.  I do hope it was an eye opener for her.  Too many weirdos still out there.
  I loved how they filmed it like it was the 70's, the houses, cars, clothes, even posters of David Cassidy in Suzie's bedroom were just so fun to look at.  Will bring back some nostalgia if  you went through that time period.
  The in between heaven and earth scenes were a nice break in the storyline, showing you the current state of Suzie.  I really liked the way these parts were done, as sad as it was sometimes, it was still uplifting quite a bit.
  I don't know, I just thought the movie had it all, suspense, family drama, life after death, lost romance, some amazing CGI effects as well as that good old visit from life in the 70's.

3769379,3,B001QOGYAO,"There are easy film reviews to write and there are tough ones. But this one balances in-between. The main reason for this is that I read (and loved)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-book-by-Alice-Sebold/dp/0316044938/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the book by Alice Sebold</a>. Deep and richly developed characters helped round out this sometimes depressing yet engaging story surrounding the murder of 14-year-old Susie Salmon (""like the fish""), and how she views her afterlife ...and looks on as her family attempts to deal with her disappearance.

Sebold incorporated a ton of information that was crucial to our understanding within the Salmon household, and the community as a whole. But much gets lost in translation. This isn't too much of a surprise, as Hollyweird requires directors to cut-cut-cut so that movies run shorter and thus can be shown more often (i.e., a three hour movie will only show about three times in a day, whereas a two hour flick jumps up to five a day).

Peter Jackson took on a major task here, but nothing compared to his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lord-of-the-Rings/dp/B000X9FLKM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lord of the Rings</a>&nbsp;series (which I found to be brilliantly done, by the way). But Jackson is more of a visual artist. Which was wonderful for Middle Earth fans. But for fans of a story that has such a heavy character background (like this), I think he floundered a bit. In place of story, we get more stunning visuals. Although I didn't mind them (in fact, I found them wondrously eye-catching), it did tick away precious seconds and minutes that otherwise could've been put toward the characters. Fans of the book will be highly depressed to learn that there's nothing in here regarding adultery, and a time-line that is skewed so that we have a more warm and fuzzy ending. Entire characters are removed (including an Indian neighbor), while others are moved around to fit an obviously tightened time-frame for the film.

Still, THE LOVELY BONES is entertaining. The special effects/green screen visuals will have your mouth hanging open. And Saoirse Ronan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Atonement/dp/B002VWNIA4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Atonement</a>) as Susie is played exceptionally well.

When he lures her into his trap, you can feel the skin prickling on the back of your neck. Tucci's Best Supporting Actor nod at the Oscars last year was well-earned.

If you haven't read the book, much of what I said here probably won't mean anything. But if you have ...well ...beware.",1275696000,,2934,5.912735849056604

There is also short shrift given to the girl's mother and little brother; it's the father and the sister that get more screen time and attention.

Oscar-winner Peter Jackson adapts his extraordinary visual style seen earlier in THE LORD OF THE RINGS and KING KONG to bring Susie's ethereal world to life as she crosses between two planes of reality while attempting to expose her killer. Jackson's imaginative fantasy worlds succeed from a visual standpoint, however his kinetic filming is smothered with constantly-sweeping camera movements that are overly dramatic and completely unnecessary. Alice Sebold's heart-felt characters are realized by the considerable cast, with Saoirse Ronan standing out above all others as the fading Susie. While Stanley Tucci manages to create the creepy and uncomfortable persona that the role of Mr. Harvey required, many of the awkward mannerisms he brings with him make it difficult to accept his character completely. Unfortunately, the motion-picture adaptation lacks the same level of suspense and heightened emotional response present in the novel. Had it been structured differently with a quickened pace and darker tone, it may have proven to be far more effective. Even still, THE LOVELY BONES offers a harrowing story built on strong characters and performances that should appeal to fans of the written work and newcomers as well.

I think many of us were surprised when it was announced that Peter Jackson would film ""The Lovely Bones."" My curiosity vanished since I remember well how he had dsstroyed one legend--the hideous remake of King Kong--and now he had his hands on a fragile novel that's narrated by a murdered girl.

When I finally got around to watching it last night, on Blu-Ray by the way, my hopes were high. At least, viually, it began promisingly. But then the plot holes began popping up. Although I stuck it with it until the end, it only got worse for this viewer.  What was mainly lacking for me was any sympathy for the survivors of the young girl's death. You never see any of it. You have zero sympathy for her or her empty-headed mother who decides to run away and ""find herself"" leaving the wimpy Mark Wahlberg to face the aftermath of the murder.

In one scene, Wahlberg runs out into a cornfield to find the killer. Instead< he encounters a young couple and the boy tries to kill wahlberg> Why?  When the mother suddenly shows up again, no one cusses her out for her selfishness.  Wahlberg embraces her with a ""Welcome back.""

The scene where the sister uncovers crucial evidence in the home of the killer is also nutty. Although she hears the killer enter the house, she continues to study the evidence while the pedophile racss up the steps. When the girl makes it safely back home, she doesn't give her grieving fathe the material. Instead all eyes are on the just arrived mother--so the girl gives her evidence to the alcohoic, chain-smoking nutjob a relative--played over the top by a miscast Susan Sarandon. In fact, you can't really connect with any of the characters since none of them are admirable or tragic. Wahlberg has the personality of a marshmallow and his shrill, boring wife is also a loser. The demise of the killer is also frustrating. You really want to see bloody justice. Instead, his death is such a boring anticlimax that you feel like screaming ""No!""

Thougout the movie, any sense of suspense or poignancy are destroyed by the directors penchant for showing the girl in a Walt Disney version of heaven. None of these scenes have any connection with the earthly tragedy. All these scenes of after-like look like music videos you'd see on VH1.

It's bizarre that a movie which deals with such a horrible tragedy has zero poignancy or tenderness. When the movie ended, instead of shedding tears, my only reaction was: Am I glad that's over with.",1273795200,27,2482,4.663615560640732

3769428,3,B001QOGYAO,"THE LOVELY BONES is a quiet novel about horrendous events described eloquently and with spiritual insights by author Alice Sebold.  While the book, being a rather introspective version of the murder of a young lass, would be difficult to translate to film, Peter Jackson (with a screenplay adaptation by Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Jackson himself) should call this version an idea inspired by Sebold's book.  If desiring a reenactment of the novel is the viewer's desire, skip this film, but if simply watching a 'different' Peter Jackson epic is your cup of tea, this film will romance you.

The young girl Susie is well played by Saoirse Ronan, and her parents are rather one dimensionally brought to celluloid by Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz, with a lot of help from the over-the-top portrayal of Susie's meddling kookie grandmother as molded by Susan Sarandon.  Susie's sister Lindsey (Rose McIver) gets to experience all the things the deceased Susie wanted to experience, Ray Singh gives an interesting bit of strange aura as Ray the one Susie would have loved had she lived, and Michael Imperioli serves well a the policeman who continues to endlessly track the murder.  But the film holds together because of the smarmy  serial killer George Harvey, yet another stellar performance by Stanley Tucci.  He is terrifyingly believable and should scare everyone who watches is sick mind work.

The special effects are 'pretty' in a sort of Hallmark cards way and Jackson tries his best to make us follow this maladaptive transformation of Sebold's novel.  But given all the negatives THE LOVELY BONES  is still worth watching, if only as a momentary diversion.  And it would be a shame not to see this performance by Stanley Tucci!

3769439,2,B001QOGYAO,"I noticed some people compare this film to What Dreams May Come.

The magic about What Dreams My Come comes from the fact that we don't know what is happening to the main character.  He doesn't even know he is dead.  We learn as he does as he goes along his 'death' journey.  Heaven can be an awesome place and we get to experience some of that through him.

With the Lovely Bones we know everything already.  The main character is going to die, we know if from the beginning and so does she.  We are then stuck in a limbo (which she knows about) with her as she tries to come to terms with her death.  The limbo that the main characters wife in What Dreams May Come undergoes is a much more convincing depiction.

Yes The Lovely Bones has some updated effects compared to What Dreams My Come has but the 'journey' is just not there.",1273622400,,833,4.2215189873417724
3769440,4,B001QOGYAO,"Upon hearing Peter Jackson had done this movie even though i knew very little about it i gave it a shot. I actually saw an advanced copy and was pretty impressed, the second time i watched it i can't say it got better but still stayed about the same, although the people i watched it with were not as equally impressed as myself. The Lovely Bones is a love or hate relationship, there is really no grey area to be found here, much like with Lord Of The Rings. You really have to have a creative, and spontaneous thought pattern, and also be creative when viewing a film like this. Its definitely a unique film that won't appeal to all audiences. Not to spoil the movie for people who haven't seen it, but the young girl Salmon(Suzie) is murdered by a local man in her neighborhood, and while being in between worlds, of heaven and earth, she tries to point the way to help her mourning family find her killer. So actually what i'll do is break it down in pros and cons to tell the good and bad points of the film.

Pros
1. Stellar effects as expected from Jackson for the in between world seens, just beautiful
2. The storyline has been done before, mainly in a movie like Ghost but is a lot more in depth this time around.
3. Good performances from Mark Walburg, Steven Tucci(up for an oscar), and an ok performance from Saoirse Ronan(suzie).
4. The reactions of the family were very plausible, though a little underwhelming in some spots.
5. Great music throughout, and great cinematography.
6. Just a good overall feel that the movie was very well planned and thought out.
7. Interesting but strange on where the title The Lovely Bones came from, a bit disturbing actually.

Cons
1. Some pretty disturbing moments and visual content, possibly an R rating? Especially when involving young girls.
2. Susan Sarandon while good is totally misplaced in this film as the grandmother.
3. That being said Susans Sarandons character seems very unmoved, numb, and even seems happy that Suzie is gone, she comes to take care of the other children and makes it the comic relief of the film.
4. Not the ending you want in anyway, but effective, the killer doesnt seem to get what he deserves.
5. The wife of the film is pretty lousy, and leaves the family to be on her own, why? To mourn? It doesnt really specify and she is never seen again after about half way through the film.
6. Some of the dialogue in a bit off base with not knowing whether to be serious or funny, or how to take it.
7. Mark Walberg is a total wimp in the film, but a good father.
8. It is never really explained why the killer did what he did, to Suzie, or the other people you find out he has killed, a major stone left unturned. Pervert, serial killer, child molester? You never find out.

So all in all i liked the film because of its unique and intriguing ghost type premise and the visual effects, Peter Jackson is still right up there with Lucas and Spielburg, but he needs to make his next 2 Hobbit films great so we can see his real talent at work. The Lovely Bones is a good film (to me) but not stellar, i give it four stars because even with all the cons it still had a pretty positive impact on me, its just better if you share the movie with someone else, but a bit boring by yourself. Btw your young kids really shouldnt see it, the moments that are a bit improper really would make children feel violated, and as i said i think they should have beefed it up to an R rating because of that fact.",1273622400,,3474,4.333333333333333
3769441,3,B001QOGYAO,"As I was thinking about what to write on the review, I realized the glasses of the ""bad guy"" are modern-style. Ie, this movie takes place in the 70s but his frames weren't thick plastic or the lenses didn't seem to be large plastic lenses (compare to the Superman I Clark Kent image of him wearing his glasses).  That's not a complaint but for some reason I thought I'd mention it for trivia or something.

I thought this movie might have a tearjerker ending, but I went through with no problems.  In fact, the ending seemed kind of anti-climactic, not the typical ending that a movie that presents a mystery might end with.  Especially when the movie has a girl who can see dead people, but the fact that her ability didn't affect the movie's progress makes me wonder why it was important to have this character in the movie.  Perhaps the book goes into better detail and spends more time with her skills.

The other strange thing in this movie is that, as several people experience some kind of supernatural moment, none of them freak out.  The little brother mentions several times about seeing his dead sister, and the adults in the house don't even correct him or try to find out if it's true.  The dad and boyfriend-interest see things that should surprise or shock them at least, even if they later accept it, but their reactions are different from what I had expected.

I think it's a movie that you could see once, to see what it's about.  I enjoyed the soundtrack.  As a film that seems like it might have some shocking moments or tearjerker parts, I didn't experience either of those emotions.",1273449600,,1604,4.554006968641115

One moment you have a child killed by a pedophile, then we're stuck watching a ten minute song and dance routine by Susan Sarandon, who is so miscast in this movie it's painful.  Wahlberg is terrible, and he never causes you to feel any pain for a father's loss.  The dreamy effects of the dead girl's ""limbo"" are pathetic and straight out of a bad Disney movie.  And how old was that guy in high school that she had a crush on, about 35?  Give me break, I've heard the book was actually good.

Although it may be the most brilliant Blu Ray you'll see this side of Avatar, aside from the stunning picture quality there's not much to recommend. When the villain of the film actually laughs an evil ""muuuwahahhahha"" laugh...then and there I knew we were in dire, dire trouble. Between the absolutely ridiculous Susan Sarandon character ( who seems to have escaped from a Lifetime TV movie), the bizarre tra-la-la afterlife scenes which are overly precious, and plain bad story telling ( plodding, awkward structure and no real emotional linchpins) it is easy to see how the movie was a box office disappointment.

The Blu Ray presentation itself is stunningly gorgeous, however it isn't supported by any kind of quality storytelling.",1273276800,6,809,4.948529411764706
3769444,3,B001QOGYAO,"The Lovely Bones is a 2009 film directed by Peter Jackson, based upon the 2002 novel of the same name authored by Alice Sebold. The film stars Saoirse Ronan as Suzie Salmon (the lead role), Mark Wahlberg as her father Jack, Rachel Weisz as her mother, Abby, and Stanley Tucci as George Harvey. Susan Sarandon and Rose McIver put in appearances as Lynn (Suzie's grandmother) and Lindsey (Suzie's older sister).

In 1973, Suzie Salmon was fourteen, living in Norristown, PA, a nice suburban town and was dreaming of becoming a famous photographer. She lived with her mother, father, older sister and younger brother. The best parts of her life were the camera that she received for her birthday and the crush that she had on a boy that she went to school with (and who was appearing to return her affections). Suzie narrates the film - it's almost entirely in her perspective - and she tells of her murder by a neighbor (Harvey, played by Stanley Tucci) as well as the impact that it has on the people that she loves. The murder happens early in the movie, so it's no surprise. We also learn a lot about her killer - a scary, single man that has an obsessive interest in making dollhouses and big glasses. This guy gave me the creeps as soon as I laid eyes upon him, even before the homicide occurred - just by his appearance. After she is murdered, Suzie wanders around the afterlife in an attempt to figure out how to close things out on Earth so that she can move on to eternal bliss in Heaven because, apparently, one cannot move from one realm to the other without that closure.

There were two shining glories in this movie - the performances of Stanley Tucci and Saoirse Ronan.  They both added to their roles in a way that the rest of the cast didn't really even come close to.  Ronan was an eager and likeable actress that brought these qualities to her vision of Suzie Salmon.  I think that a big part of the reason that I liked Suzie was because I also liked Ronan.  Tucci was rightfully nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. That nomination was well deserved. He WAS the character (well, I hope not really in real life. I'm assuming he's not, which is why his performance as so amazing).

There were other parts of the move that were difficult to deal with - sometimes, it was tedious.  The movie itself was way too long for what the characters' motivations were - the movie could have been much shorter than it was. Jackson also made the afterlife a little too literal - almost everyone that believes in the afterlife has an opinion as to what it looks like on the other side and Jackson threatened to isolate many people. Also, if you're looking for a murder mystery/police procedural then this isn't the movie for you because the murder and its perpetrator are identified right off the bat.

Generally, an ok movie.  I enjoyed it.",1273017600,,2864,4.532945736434108
3769445,3,B001QOGYAO,"So I wrote a review of this film the night I first saw it at a sneak preview here in Portland, Oregon on January 12, 2010.  Unfortunately, I had written it directly into a text box, and never saved it along the way.  So my review is lost for now.  However, I did purchase the DVD and anticipate a final summation of the film, separate from the book at some point.

I believe that Alice Sebold's ""The Lovely Bones"" is one of the most remarkable stories and also one of the greatest publishing feats in my lifetime.  40,0000,000 copies sold well before the film even went into production.  The novel has been translated into 28 language.  It sat ON the NY Times TOP TEN fiction seller's list for 54 weeks straight.  That's more than a year!  No one accomplishes that these days... not even Stephen King or other pop fiction writers.  With no doubt, Sebold's novel will remain within my top 10 reading experiences ever.  Please go out and buy it.  In the meantime, based on the sneak preview in Portland, our film critic, Shawn Levy, a much heralded film critic across this country, shared his insights into the FILM in our state newspaper the very next day; he stressed he had never read the book.

I am chiming in here by sharing the letter I wrote for publication in ""The Oregonian"" a day after Levy's review hit the stands.  I hope for those of you who have read the book or have seen the movie - but not both - that my letter helps to draw some distinguishing facts about this DVD, the history behind production and how I'm still on this horrible fence trying to turn something I'm frustrated by into something definitively more OR less meaningful to me.

I feel privileged to have Mr. Levy living in my city.  He understood key themes and managed to fill in gaps in the film based on his intuition, intelligence and his keen eye for knowing when a scene has ended up on the cutting room floor, even though he never read the book.

""Mr. Levy's Take on 'The Lovely Bones'""
Levy fan, here, for years. BUT, the film is rated PG13, not R - which weighs HUGE significance in what ended up on screen and what was omitted.  I'm happy to have come across Levy's review, which is by his admittance, a review of the film and that he is unfamiliar with the source material of Alice Sebold's immeasurably successful novel. Some books are meant to stay just that; books. Brave Jackson took on the adaptation, but the film does not stand on its own. It tries, desperately to rush everything from the book onto the screen with a rather embarrassing lack of confidence, fluidity or true closure. I followed everything I could about the production of the film. Too many hands in a cookie jar. Too many compromises. For the average viewer not familiar with the book, I'll assume very few will see it for what Jackson haphazardly tried to message (though Levy surprisingly culled out what must have been left on the cutting room floor as he pieced it together and for the most part, was correct!).

First, it's a fable, folks. If not seen in that light, the viewer won't walk away with even part of what the novel accomplished. The film captures a time and place that is resonant for any parent in suburban 1970's or children who grew up at that time, too. The most commonly misconstrued notion of this story is that it's all about a serial pedophile. In fact, the book is steeped in the culture of sex in the 70's. The characters are drawn from a time and place in our country where households became more and more insular after the radical 60's.  Families held many secrets from one another, and often lived two lives (how about those car-key swapping swingers parties and then taking the children to church on Sunday?).  The plot keenly captures the politics and dynamics of a family and a community, deepened and fully disclosed through the naivet of the story's protagonist, an innocent 14-year old girl who is brutally raped and murdered within 10 minutes of the start of the film (or a few pages into the novel).

Over the proceeding years, she watches over her family as it splinters and mends and becomes something she first does not try to understand, then resists when her loved ones change over time and she isn't, and finally only when she accepts the fate that rests within each and every other character does she obtain closure. How universal are those themes?!? Jackson's filing down of the story to an ""emotional thriller"" (his words) -- ""with supernatural elements"" (again, his words during production) -- is appalling. His interpretation would have been fine... had he not continued to flush what he brought to the screen with his poor pick-and-choose methodology of the source material, perhaps he could have made something of his own. I think of screen adaptations where a director and screenwriter achieve greatness from a book that was less than extraordinary. Think the horrid, flat novel ""Fried Green Tomatoes"". Now think: How did the movie nail everything quite perfectly when the source material was so poorly written that they really aren't comparable? Same can be said for Rick Moody's excellent book ""The Ice Storm"" when the adaptation took the story miles away in terms of real impact for the film viewer.  Jackson failed in his mission, and ironically did so after desperately trying to faithfully translate the novel to screen.  This film was in the can and ready for a December 2008 release.  Much tinkering, debate and ego bruising in Hollywood saw this film remain in the editing room for another 13 MONTHS before it finally hit screens.  Come on.  The more hands on anything simply dilutes the final delivery of the finished ""product.

BTW, Heaven, Mr. Levy, is not to be confused by 40 million readers who commonly identified -- through language, life, geography, culture, religion and spirituality, with the ""In Between"". Hence, the power of ""The Lovely Bones.""  [END]

So there you have.  My review would actually point out the following:

Hugh Jackman didn't bite at playing the father which is great, but I wish they had stuck with Ryan Gosling in the role during preliminary shooting instead of mutually agreeing he was too young looking for the part.  (Hello, can't that be said for every single film Leonardo DiCaprio EVER has made????).  Heck, Rachel Weisz' part is so walk-through, they should have fired her and found Ryan a match (which they originally had been considering Helen Hunt as the mother).  Bringing Walberg in?  Wow.  You could tell that actor that everyone in his family drop dead of simultaneous brain explosions and he'd still look like someone splattered menthol on his eye lashes to make him ""cry"".  His performance was so uneven, it was embarrassing.  Stanley Tucci was brave to take on the role of a pedophile killer, but did so to create one of the most memorable (if creepy) characters on screen in the past year or more.  Saiorse Ronan was BORN to play the part of Susie Salmon.  I cannot imagine any young adult actress who could have pulled off what she commanded.  Watch her facial ticks and listen to her vocal tonations, match your ears to the cadence of her voice, and how she can express 20 different emotions within a three minute scene, and do so without uttering an actual word.  Just shifts in her body, her eyes, her stance, the wisping away of a hair in her eyesight, her flinch or uncertainty.  Her total lack of being comfortable where she is.  No ""child"" actor has pulled off such range since Haley Joel Osment starred in ""The Sixth Sense"".  Susan Saradon played a stock character, but at least wasn't too cloyingly boring.  Picking an actress who in real life is actually is SIX years older than Ronan to play her ""younger"" sister... uh, I can't even go there, though I enjoyed seeing Rose McIver in a larger part of a major movie.

Then there were the scenes literally dropped to the editing room floor that were very key in understanding motivations, background characterization and a more dense, yet explainable story on film.  Parts dropped I will not go into detail here and spoil the novel.  But Rachel Weisz, Michael Imperioli, the character of Ray Singh's completely missing mother, Ruana, and actress Carolyn Dando's role... they ALL were substantial to the storyline.  They should have been included or left in.  They connect such significant plot lines.

See, here's the takeaway.  Jackson didn't own his own story.  His choices in what was left out versus in, the poor manipulation of Sebold's time line and attempting to create THREE different endings (and USE THEM ALL!!?!??), rather than use the expertise of Sebold's wonderfully closed ending were all just bad decisions.  I'd still rate the movie 3 stars since the rest of the crap on our t.v. and theater screens sucks far more than this failed attempt at retelling the contents of Sebold's dense, real and surreal novel.  Oh, and for every review I see on here where people gripe about ""Heaven"" or ""Pedophile"" or ""Boring"" or ""I just didn't GET it"" or too many ""CGI"" effects, read the novel since you clearly didn't understand what was presented to you or why.  Not necessarily your fault, but criticizing something that collectively is cohesive for many others, well, that's odd.  It is not ""Heaven"" it is the ""In Between"" and if you don't like character driven movies that don't end in explosions everywhere or really sophomoric humor, then don't pick a DRAMA and then pee all over it.

3769475,2,B001QOGYAO,"I've read the book twice, and in addition to the failures elucidated by other reviewers, especially Jackson's infatuation with special effects and the lack of emotional connection to the characters, the movie is not faithful to the structure of the book. In the book Susie is murdered, cut up into pieces, put into the safe, and the safe dumped into the sinkhole, at the very beginning. Jackson cuts away from all of this, apparently thinking he is respecting our tender feelings.

 Toward the end, the icycle is shown falling on Mr. Harvey as though impersonally, when in the book it is clearly Susie who causes it to fall.

 Also, it isn't one charm Mr. Harvey keeps, it is the whole charm bracelet.

 When Susie breaks through and takes over Ruth's body, she and Ray Singh make love two or three times. Jackson shows only the kiss. Again, it seems that a certain pudeur on the part of Jackson has kept him from showing us the real story.

 The characters of Ruth, Ray Singh and Ray's mother were well developed in the book, but in the movie they appear only for a moment as stick figures.

 Not that the book is perfect. The zany grandmother was lifted right out of Ann Tyler. So were the names, Buckley, Holiday -- these are Ann Tyler names. Samuel Heckart, the boyfriend of Lindsey, has very little reality.

 Toward the end of the book everyone returns to the town because the sinkhole is going to be filled in. This gets our attention, because Susie is in the sinkhole. But Sebold drops that whole idea with a clang and proceeds to the ending. The family is all together again and Susie reflects that her death is part of a structure yet to be completed, a structure involving all her loved ones. The title THE LOVELY BONES is derived rather clumsily from this concept of a new structure, but I daresay it sold Sebold some books.

 I think the book is filmable, but only with different writers and a different director. There is a saying to the effect that: ""After you've made Lord of the Rings and King Kong, you can't go back to your original talent. That talent was young. That talent was hungry. You're not young or hungry now."" The director of Heavenly Creatures was out of his depth here.

She is in another world between heaven and earth and is trying to help her family cope with her loss and help lead them to her murderer. However, her good intentions to help her family backfire and her father becomes obsessed with trying to figure out who murdered her. Her mother becomes numb and gets a job picking fruit to avoid dealing with the pain of the situation.
The murder of Susie is not played out on screen and you don't know exactly what happens but you get a basic understanding. I am now curious to read the book and see what the film cut out.
One flaw that I found with the film was the love interest of Susie. The two seemed to be quite mismatched and lacked chemistry. However, I liked it overall and didn't think I would.",1272499200,,1096,4.299516908212561
3769511,4,B001QOGYAO,"Based on Alice Sebold's 2002 novel of the same name, this movie by New Zealand's Peter Jackson tells the alternatingly haunting and uplifting story of Suzie Salmon, a young girl murdered by a neighbor in the early 1970's.  In death, Suzie watches her family from above as they deal in various ways with her disappearance.  I haven't read the book, but I have learned that it is much more graphic and intricate than the film version.

Lead actress Saoirse Ronan plays Susie, and Miss Ronan is a true find!  She carries this film, which is no small feat considering how often it teeters toward being both maudlin and saccharine in its depiction of ""the in-between"", the not-quite-Heaven zone in which she finds herself after she dies.  She doesn't achieve access to Heaven until her murder has reached some sort of closure in real life.

For all its flaws (the often overly-fanciful effects work) this film mostly works.  The acting is very good all across the board.  What was most interesting to me was that it veers from genre formula by not engaging in last-minute heroics in one particular scene near the end.  As a viewer, you root for the villain's deeds to be discovered at a particular moment.  Instead, it takes a heart-breaking turn toward sadness and disappointment which is almost immediately erased in favor of a somewhat ethereal optimism  --  Suzie is perhaps less concerned with seeing her murderer meet justice than we are  --  she has different priorities at that possible moment of revelation.  We want to see justice, but Suzie is still trying to find her joy. [""Huh?  What?""  Just go with me on this one.  You'll understand when you see it.]  Suzie is not interested in seeing justice served.  Her goal is loftier --  to allow her family, her father in particular, to let go of her and live free of the exquisite pain of her loss.  [Or something like that  -- just watch the damn thing]

The film was not a huge success at the box office and received more than its fair share of negative reviews (notably from those who disapproved of its absence of religious themes).  But as a stand-alone experience, it is quite unique and worth the trip.",1272499200,,2161,4.683510638297872

The moral of The Lovely Bones is don't let anger destroy you.  A beautiful but extremely difficult film to watch, one with a powerful message.

3769513,5,B001QOGYAO,"I think a good test for whether this may be the movie for you to watch is how well you liked the movie WHAT DREAMS MAY COME starring Robin Williams.  This has a very similar look and feel to it, especially in terms of what an afterlife and heaven might look like. The premise is the same as that film as well: someone dies a very violent and sudden death and suddenly finds herself in the afterlife, trying to reach back to her family.  In this situation the girl has been murdered by her neighbor, Stanley Tucci, who is a serial killer. I read about half of the novel when it first came out but I found it too depressing and couldn't finish it. The movie is not as depressing which makes it easier to experience that the novel.  This is NOT a ""who done it.""  You know exactly ""who done it"" within the earliest parts of the movie. This is also not a movie about a serial killer. It is simply a given that he is one and murders her.  Tucci does a very good job in a thankless role.  The actress playing the girl is also quite good and Marc Wahlberg, as usual, turns in his usual superior acting job. Peter Jackson of LORD OF THE RINGS  fame directs and he certainly makes this material as palatable and visual as it can be made.

What did he do with all the dirt?? LOL..nobody notices this?? He approaches his victim in broad daylight in middle of said field..nobody notices?? How did he destroy his den?? He kept a ton of keepsakes in it..the police couldn't get one clue out of it??  How did get that 500 pound safe up from his basement to his car by himself??

The way the film is shot makes for an amazing play on emotions and tension.  This film is almost poetic in the way it is offered.  As a Christian, I must emphasize that the film's view of the afterlife is strange and not particularly Biblical.  However, the film was so haunting that it has had me thinking of its rich landscape long after it was over.  Saoirse Ronan's acting is absolutely top notch.  Her portrayal is riveting and beautiful.

Maybe it was because I was expecting so little, I came away from my first viewing pleasantly surprised and moved by the beauty of this film.  I love Peter Jackson's work.  Heavenly Creatures is one of my favorite movies of all time, and I think this film surpasses that one in visual beauty.  While this movie is not a literal adaptation of Sebold's The Lovely Bones, it remains faithful to the spirit of the novel and to its most important plot elements. The movie does a wonderful job in exploring the evolution of the victim's character, after her death.  My only quibble with the film is that I wish that it had spent a little more time in developing how her family gradually became reconciled to her passing.  But no matter, this is still a beautiful movie that handles a most brutal crime in an unflinching, yet transcendant manner.",1272240000,,905,4.590062111801243

The movie is beautifully filmed with gorgeous fantasy other worlds matched with stunning vistas of the real world.  While Mark Wahlberg, Rachel Weisz and Susan Sarandon are fine in their roles, the movie belongs to Saorise Ronan and Stanley Tucci.  Ronan is stunning as the murdered girl caught in a purgatory torn between her lust for revenge and a need to provide solace to her grieving family.  Tucci's quietly malevolent killer is chilling.  I would have preferred a more appropriate finish to his character, his ironic death is disturbingly satisfying.  Not the classic it should have been, THE LOVELY BONES is nonetheless quality film-making.",1272067200,,760,5.34453781512605
3769520,5,B001QOGYAO,"I've been waiting for ""The Lovely Bones"" as an offering on my satellite service. It came last night! I read the beautiful, but very sad book--its basis-- when it was first published. How can a movie depict ethereal, esoteric, other-worldly even adequately? Peter Jackson, director extraordinaire, could do it! He did it!

His ethereal success--there is no way to do justice to a review of this movie without spilling spoilers,the biggest being Susie's murder early in the story and by a  neighbor. When the movie first came to theaters, several actors appeared as guests on ""The David Letterman Show"" to promote the film. Letterman was appalled at the subject matter--the death of a child and could not recommend such a subject. Now that he has his own child, Letterman sees the world through the lens of a father and could not imagine the horror Mark Wahlberg went through as Susie's father. His stunned facial features gave no false impression of this movie!

You see, that is the success of Jackson's directorial powers--making viewers feel sick at the loss of life of this sweet little girl (14 and looking forward to her first kiss). The actress is a darling and the audience comes to love her during her sojourn in the afterlife before going forward. Everyone is stuck at the time of Susie's disappearance--father, mother, sister, brother, a boyfriend in the making, grandmother. Even the murderer is stuck in that he lives and relives and relives the murder (much blood was lost, according to the detective on the case).

The strange, eerie sequences that show life after death, at least for Susie, will puzzle the viewer. These do not jibe with standard religious motifs. Just go with the flow here. Alice Sebold wrote the novel this way. She is the creator of this world--beautiful, pure, ethereal, but, I found, also vaguely terrifying. My personal taste is that the director keep to the author's world and not create his own. A beloved book made into a film is expected to be faithfully rendered from the word to the screen. Jackson does this. Thank you.

This may be a small point from the movie as a whole, but the single most disturbing incident is the destruction of the underground chamber. He took great pains to create a cozy spot, then tore it up, like a spider's nest. Kill the victim, then destroy the nest. Such detail, such effort for one murder. Ah, wow, little girl, what a prize you were. (I'm intending this to sound sick because the man is very disturbed. As the family comes unraveled, so does the neighbor, until he, too, is flicked off the spider web.

Knowing in advance that this film is not fast-paced, but rather delivers through characterization, nuances of plot development, and esoteric, ethereal episodes, you will be prepared. This is a film you will love and appreciate for its artistic and faithful details or dislike for its slow and confusing passages.",1272067200,3,2896,4.828629032258065
3769521,4,B001QOGYAO,"In a time in american history when people did things like sleep with their doors unlocked, talk to strangers, and basically trust those who lived in their neighborhoods, the last thing on anyone's mind was child adbduction. Even more gruesome, child murder rears its head and says ""here I am,"" taking the life of a 14-year-old girl who liked to take pictures, imagined herself as a wilflife photograpger, and helped her Dad build ships in bottles. The crime struck hard, and harder still was the acceptance of this tragedy by both the girl and her family. And all the while a killer walked their streets, looking at other Salmon to swim his way.

One thing I can say for The Lovely Bones was that it had many asthetically pleasing parts. There were the portions where we saw the place in-between, and these were rich and vibrant. You could see the Peter Jackson of new in this, with his directive toward special effects here. I also liked the narration that the girl added to the mix, making the story touching and sad for everyone involved. You could feel her plight as she watched life pass her by, and you could see her worry about those people she cared about but could do nothing to comfort.

On the flipside of this, I thought that the movie really played down some of what had transpired. When i call a child killing a visually appealing movie, it seems like an odd thing to say. Still, the PG-13 label says a lot about what you should expect - and that is sad considering how well the characters come to life. From the father to the killer, I thought there was a lot to be explored. Still, with the the time ticking away, I knew little about the killer in this and, well, I thought this was somewhat important. I know it was her tale and I know that it was aiming for a different level but, in the end, the killer wasn't painted in the light I thought he should have been.

All this said, the movie was still good and I still liked it and would say watch it. I thought it had a lot to offer to someone and I cannot say I didn't enjoy the film. I thought the ending, like a spin on a Karma-laced wheel, was a little much and I really didn't like that. I would watch but buying - that's another matter altogether.",1272067200,,2219,4.3421686746987955

3769523,3,B001QOGYAO,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film - it may not have the world's best script, and is quite possibly not the best movie of the year, however... i liked the direction in many ways, this had some lovely sequences in it, especially the 'in-between' worlds sequences, simply beautiful. The casting was quite adequete. Susan Sarandon was sensational, she is becoming quite the 'Bette Davis' of our era i think. The consummate actress who, i think, due to her talent, will never stop working, and there will always be a role for her. I always find Rachael Weisz interesting to begin with - but she never ends up taking me anywhere too interesting, or holding my interest at that! The best performance of this movie is Stanley Tucci as Mr. Harvey. Anyone who remembers him in 'Shall We Dance' must reflect on that film after seeing him in this one, and conclude that he is truly one of the most versatile and talented movie actors of our generation. He makes every scene of this characterization of the child killer - although seemingly simple man - so intriguing and interesting to watch - I was captivated by his every scene.

The story and the subject matter - based on the well known novel of the same name - is disturbingly shocking, and ultimately terribly heart-breaking. Peter Jackson's depiction on film of this story helps the audience 'feel' the sublte aspects of the relationships - and this is what I like most about the film i think.

I am very surprised there is no Special Features on this DVD. I would have thought there'd be at least a featurette about the making of the film, if not a Director's Commentary. I would be very interested in watching this movie with Peter Jackson's commentary - as i liked the direction very much.",1272067200,,1734,4.644951140065147

Is it the book? No.  It is its own work and every bit as entertaining and engrossing.  Every element of the film drew me in; it was paradox of sorts, as real as it was surreal.  I found myself cringing at one moment and tearing up at another.  I never noticed the acting because I believed the characters to be real; the movie brought to life the 70's in a way few have for me.  Now, an hour after I finished watching it, I find myself wanting to re-visit the film, this time paying more attention to the craft of the thing.
Years ago, when I was young with small children, I lost my husband to a sudden, violent death in a plane crash.  I understand the spiritual connection that lingers.  I imagined many times what the transition might have been like for him as he left behind those he loved. I still at times catch my breath as I think of him and wonder if he still sees us and remembers.  Perhaps that is the reason I love this film: it is part thriller, part exploration of death.

utilizing great special effects throughout.
Saoirse Ronan captured the ill-fated Susie Salmon to a tee!
She exudes all of the sunlight of a cherub and brings forth
the uncertainty and self-absorption of being a 14-yr old girl
who is full of life, loves her family, and is beginning to have the
unmistakable pangs of her first love before she is brutally murdered
by her neighbor, played with reptilian cunning by Stanley Tucci!!
Tucci's cold calculating and deeply disturbed Mr. Harvey is by far
the break away performance of the film!
After Susie is murdered, she is caught between heaven and earth in a
beautiful purgatory-like netherworld where she can see her family as
they deal with the aftermath of her murder. Mark Wahlberg turns in a
very passionate performance as the father of Susie.
Susan Sarandon is great as the alcoholic eccentric hot mess of a grandmother,
who comes to live with her daughter and her family after the murder of Susie
to supposedly help them along, but she does more harm than good!---She's funny though.

Michael Imperioli plays Lt. Fennerman, the detective who's assigned to solve
Susie Salmon's murder case, but is struggling because there isn't a whole
lot of evidence & viable leads, and forensic DNA profiling is still
30 yrs in the future. (-:
In the book, there are a lot more layers to this story and
Lt. Fennerman and Abigail, Susie's mother, even have an affair together.
Comforting each other...she in her pain over her daughter's murder,
and he, still grieving over the recent loss of his wife to illness.
Fennerman's character in the book is much more developed than in the movie.
Without going into a blow by blow detail of the movie, I'll just say that
I still found it to be interesting and entertaining.
It was just kind of muddled in some places, and they had to summarize
alot of the original story to make it work for Hollywood sensibilities.
I'm glad that I rented this movie first though...not to say that it's
not worth buying, but it ranked as just okay overall in my book....
Meaning it was interesting, entertaining, but not strong enough for me
to add it to my collection. Of course, that's just my humble opinion...
You can judge for yourself. (-:

  ""The Lovely Bones"" is a contagious novel, however, it is quite disturbing.  The book opens with the rape and murder of a young teenage girl.  The narrator and murder victim, Susie Salmon, is brutally mutilated, and then reaches her own personal heaven after leaving this world.  The majority of ""The Lovely Bones"" takes place in heaven, where Susie narrates her life story, about her family, loves and losses.  At times though, she embarks on tedious flashbacks, while at other moments, the reader experiences anger and sadness with Mr. Harvey, her murderer.  Generally, the book was entertaining, but its sticky-sweet ending soured the book slightly.

  Numerous other Amazon reviewers praise the book for its genius.  They say that there hasn't been a book like this in ages, and that its words are like a sweet melody compared to other books' choppy plots.  A few said that even though the book was sad, they took the utmost pleasure in reading it for its sentimental value.  I personally think that the book, as a whole, was very good, but it is more than shy of a masterpiece.  The flashbacks and real time transitions throughout the book were tough to keep up with.  Also, there were science fiction-like parts to the tale that were hard to accept.  The unrealistic parts and the too-good-to-be-true ending took away some of the impact of the overall message.

  The author, Alice Sebold, however, knew exactly how to make the reader feel the full impact of Susie's terror, based on her own personal experience.  Sebold, herself, had been raped as a young woman.  She describes Susie's terror dramatically.  You can tell from her passionate writing that she wants to emphasize how easily girls and children are persuaded and manipulated. Sebold makes it clear that ""Stranger Danger"" is not a stranger.  As a best-seller, this book has brought to light the horrific problem of child abuse and torture.

  Overall, this is a wonderfully frightening, and enlightening tale.  Even the kinks in the book don't ultimately matter because the take-home message is so powerful. The reader cannot help but to feel a new consciousness about the world and its dangers.  Ms. Sebold has definitely created something to remember and touched thousands of readers' hearts in the process.",1271894400,3,2294,4.994708994708994

3769540,3,B001QOGYAO,"Having watched this film, i have a lot to say about how it was made. For the good, the obvious whould be the acting. Stanley Tucci plays one of the better performances of 2009 as Susie's murderer, George Harvey. Saoirse Ronan does an outstanding job portraying the main character, Susie to a degree which was worthy of all awards she was nominated for or won. The cast is rounded out nicely by great performances from Mark Wahlberg, Rachel Weisz, and Rose Mclver as Jack, Abigail, and Lindsey respectivley. Other pros for this film include great direction during suspenseful/action sequence for which Peter Jackson is good for (Lord of the Rings Trilogy, King Kong). But as for the bad. I finished reading the book by Alice Sebold a few months ago after having it recommended to me by a friend. The book quickly became my all time favorite book because of how it branched off into several different plotlines and was able yet to wrap it up extreemly well at the end. I do not usually get emotional over books but this novel got me. Especially when (spoiler alert)Buckley learns of Susie's fate via monopoly pieces (end of spoilers). However be that as it may, Jackson had a very tough time bringing that same sense of emotion that i felt while reading the book. The film had its moments but at the end it left me of a sense that the main purpose of the book had been lost within an attempt to change the book's story into a ""CSI"" esque film inwhich the only plotline to show was the one of Jack's struggle to expose Harvey. I felt that this movie should not have left anything out of the book since it was all equally important to what made the book so great, no matter how long the final product whould have been. Another thing i personally had wrong with this film was the art direction taken for Susie's ""in-between"". The overall concept of her heaven was completley changed and i felt that was not cool. And because of this, the ""in-between"" was made with poorly edited sequences of CGI (namely the scene where the ships in the bottles where crashing on the shore). This movie was good had its viewer never read the book. It was acted out excellently and had a mostly good outcome but being that the book is my favorite novel ever, i felt deeply disappointed by what Jackson did.",1271808000,,2283,4.516908212560386

It tells the tale of victim who strives for justice in the afterlife, and her family who is hoping for justice while trying to move on with their own lives. Her family struggles to maintain some semblance of a normal life, but with great difficulty. This makes for a very emotionally draining performance from these actors. The victim, Suzy Salmon, is forced to deal with the uncertainty of finding peace in death. Confusing and unclear, death forces Suzy to focus on what her life meant for others.

The movie is a cut and paste job of the book that tries to do too much with too many characters. Jackson switches point of view just enough to never allow us to connect to anyone in the film.

It's also a meditation on the horror and creepiness of child molesters. And the wistfulness of lives cut short. These themes are not for kids, so beware. It will give them nightmares.

But it's hard to say what this movie is supposed to be. She doesn't seem to have much power to affect the outcome, so there's not much connection between her and the ""real"" world.

Now, I realize this statement might be controversial, but all those scenes lingering on little girls (alive or dead) and physical teen romance seemed to border on a sort of unhealthy vibe. I don't know if that was the intent.

3769546,5,B001QOGYAO,"What happens when we die by a murderer. In a manner of such brutality that makes those left living go crazy. Peter Jackson took a leap and said how about this concept. I love it because it is unique. Everyone with a ridged view of what happens when you die will be upset by this film. Since we need to always examine new ideas look at this film from a fresh perspective don't assume anything if you can. What happens after we die is a mystery that is still fascinating.

I Think about how the tale unfolds what force brings about the finding of a body so hidden so lost that it should stay hidden.
Could it be the will of those whose life is taken the deep and intense desire for justice I believe it most certainly can.
You'll love this film if you can think outside the box and keep an open mind. Peter carefully creates the terrible scene of her murder without making us sit through the event minute by minute we know what happens and its done with love for the victim and her family. However the reality of what she suffered and lost are intense but done with dignity.

Real Cases
Walking on a trail in the Mountains leads to a partial skeleton. The long lost daughter comes home.
I am thinking of how a skeleton surfaces in the cameras of people out for a look see around Aruba's coastline.
I am thinking of a of a little girl who was buried under cement till a fisherman thought he saw something and began to dig.

How with the tides and wind and storms erosion and the coming of spring the dead come home to tell the tale.
The murderer is always surprised they are so sure nobody will ever find the body! How foolish to believe they are safe even after the victim dies.",1270598400,,1676,4.247648902821316
3769557,1,B001QOGYAO,"It is utterly stupefying that such a dreadful mess as The Lovely Bones could have come from such a proven visionary as Peter Jackson. This is the man who made the awe-inspiring Lord of the Rings trilogy, and the overstuffed, but remarkable King Kong just five years ago. He also made the brilliant Heavenly Creatures, perhaps a prelude to this movie, considering its combination of fantasy and serious drama. But in the time that has passed since Heavenly Creatures (roughly 16 years), it seems that Jackson has lost a lot of his flair.

Fourteen-year-old Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan) is brutally murdered by her neighbor, child murderer George Harvey (Stanely Tucci). She ends up in a sort of purgatory, which in this case is a world full of colorful and elaborate effects, and Disney World type magic. It is sometimes a paradise, sometimes a leaky realm that allows Susie to see what's up on earth. Her father (played effortlessly here by Mark Whalberg) is trying to track down Susie's murderer, and as it becomes more and more his obsession, his family deteriorates over the loss.

There is more to the plot, but it would be pointless to address it here, I think. As Susie guides her father from the other side, and the killer manages to pop in and out in effectively creepy, but clichd scenes, and Susie's grandmother (Susan Sarandon) shows up to help out around the house in one of the goofiest, most out of place sequences in recent memory, the movie slowly and painfully falls apart. I honestly felt embarrassed at what I was watching on screen at times: embarrassed for the actors, for the writers, and particularly for Jackson, who can and obviously has done much better work.

One of the most disturbing things about this movie, aside from the utter absence of Rachel Weiz, who plays Susie's mother but is rarely on screen, is the message that we are apparently meant to receive. Susie is murdered and possibly raped by a sadistic child-killer, and alas, she wakes up in a never-never land full of joy, fantasy, color, magical things like giant turntables, and she has a grand old time. So what are we supposed to take away from this? That the killer did her a favor by sending her to every young girl's utopia? It is remarkable how so much drama was left out among the grieving family, including her parents' apparent separation, which flew right over my head.

The acting is fairly strong in this movie. I think that Whalberg is very good as the obsessed, grief-stricken father, and Tucci does a nice job as the typical creepy kid-killer with a speech impediment. Susan Sarandon's presence is a mystery to me, seeing as how she is really just a caricature of the boozy, cynical grandmother who is always sucking on a cigarette. It adds nothing to the movie, and it's a clich. The very talented young actress Saoirse Ronan does her best, and is good in parts, but most of her narrative lines feel contrived for the sake of the movie. At 14, she is too young to be having many of the thoughts that she has, and because all of her scenes take place in the CGI world that Jackson cooked up with his effects team, she is also in the most boring scenes. The best scenes are in the real world, and even those get tiresome after a while.

I have never read Alice Sebold's acclaimed novel The Lovely Bones. I am curious to know if it is as bizarrely appalling as Peter Jackson's film adaptation, or as withdrawn from its characters. My guess is that it's not. I speculate that Jackson has taken a very promising and intriguing concept, and sacrificed all of the most vital dramatic details in lieu of high-priced, and in some cases, downright cheesy special effects. Special effects absolutely cannot substitute for real emotion and drama, and this is what happens when it is attempted.",1270425600,15,3789,4.674662668665667
3769558,5,B001QOGYAO,"You can lead a horse's ass to water but you can't make-em think! No guns and car chases or sophomoric sexual innuendo and many people are lost evidently. The ""Saw"" movies got higher ratings than Lovely Bones, for god's sake-what does that say about the intelligence of the movie going public. I won't waste my time ranting in ignorance against something I just don't understand, instead I will talk about the film and what I liked.
Peter Jackson has made, what i found to be, a fascinating film, equal parts dramatic suspense, artistic fantasy and psycho horror movie. I thought it succeeded on every level. It is unpredictable, held my attention for the duration of the movie and elicted many emotions out of me. Except for being slightly long towards the end, a sin most movies commit, something one doesn't mind so much when they re-watch their favorite movies, it was a taut thriller and ironically, a light speculation about the after life. The actors all did fine jobs, especially Susan Sarandon, creating a funny and dynamic alcoholic mother-in-law.

She tells the story from Heaven, showing the lives of the people around her and how they have changed all while attempting to get someone to find her lost body.  I have never read the book but the movie is great. It is very interesting. The visual effects are great and the score is perfect. In my opinion, the movie is creative and entertaining. I'm sure the book is more elaborate so I might have to read it. A must see movie.",1269993600,3,542,4.366336633663367
3769560,3,B001QOGYAO,"Had I watched The Lovely Bones before I read the book I am not sure if I would have understood much of what happened in the movie.  In my opinion, all the movie needed to really be ""great"" was time.  Unfortunately, as a theatrical release -- there isn't enough time to expand a story.  It's herd 'em in, herd 'em out.  Check out the current movie time lengths at your local theaters and see that many are less than 90 minutes these days (and that's with credits!).

If they could have put the stunning photography into a TV mini-series and kept the gritty-ness of the storyline in it as well, this could be a masterpiece.  It, of course, will never happen.  You will have to settle for the book, which is absolutely absorbing.  I picked it up at my local store, read the first few pages (which is rare for me) and realized I had read the entire first chapter.  The writer grabs you and doesn't let go.

The acting was excellent, but again, much too abreviated plots that were eliminated or altered for the movie leaves them little to work with. They cut about fifteen years of life out of the book, for Pete's sake. The leads did not disappoint acting-wise at all.  I also felt that some of the best acting was from Susan Sarandon who really captured the essense of the grandmother from the book.  Not that she was my favorite character, but again, she carried the spirit of the original character.  Stanley Tucci delivers a real sense of smarminess that actually brought George Harvey to life even better than the book, and that is hard to beat.  His performance was excellent but extremely hard to bear.  Watch Tucci's own expression as they played one of his scenes preceding his winning of an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.  You could see his unease and actual loathing of the character he played.  I think Tucci is finally being recognized for his excellent acting skills.  The parents, played a couple of my favorites Mark Wahlberg and Rachael Weisz, had nothing to work with. Wahlberg at least had a couple of scenes that let him show his skills.  Michael Imperioli was left with almost nothing in the movie whereas his character was extremely fleshed out in the book and a major part of the storyline.  Of course, Saoirse Ronan was perfect as Susie Salmon.

For what time the movie was given, I think it stands fairly well on it's own.  The book was better.",1269648000,,2375,4.538823529411765

3769562,5,B001QOGYAO,"Some drama films are the kind that you feel emotional resonance for the characters, feel mildly engaged by the plot, think about it for a few seconds after leaving the theater, get into your car, get pissed off at a stupid driver, and quickly move back into your own life. The Lovely Bones isn't that kind of movie.

Director Peter Jackson, of Lord of the Rings and King Kong fame, doesn't seem like the most obvious choice to direct the adaptation of the seemingly untouchable Alice Sebold novel, but he does his best, by staying close to the source material, but occasionally taking things out here and there. He also brings alot of ah-mazing CGI shots that are so gorgeous, they may be worth the price of admission alone, and I doubt we would've had that type of a movie if anybody else had directed it. However, you get the feeling that Jackson paid too much attention to the CGI aspect, while he could've dealt with the center plot issue with more directorial sensitivity, mocking the same way the book was written, and that's what stops this from being a perfect movie.

The plot centers around Susie Salmon (played by Saoirse Ronan), a 14-year-old girl who is raped and murdered in 1973. Ronan was absolutely perfect in this role. She showed promise in the 2007 film Atonement, where she also played a terrified youth who is dealing with an unbelievable situation. In the film, Susie is watching over her family, the boy she was in love with, and her killer -- from her own personal heaven.

Stanley Tucci nails his role, playing the demented serial killer Mr. Harvey. He gives a particularly chilling, and uncannily believable performance, showing more versatility with every film he makes, you can tell that he really got lost in this role, because his part isn't one of those where you find yourself wondering what the actor has previously starred in -- you see his character, and he does a damn fine job at it.

Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz and Susan Sarandon play Susie's family, and each of those roles require the actor to display quite alot of emotion, grieving her loss, and they all do terrific work, causing you to feel the extreme remorse that their characters do, and I really don't know if better actors could have been selected to play the respective parts.

Nikki SooHoo plays Holly, a girl who Susie meets in heaven, another victim of Mr. Harvey. Her role is particularly memorable, serving as something of a reassuring voice to the Ronan's character, and I see her doing great things in her future, because, while being an unknown actress, she shows just as much talent as the other actors in this all-star cast.

The core of this movie, however, the reason to go and see it in a packed theatre, doesn't lie in its acting, or the writing, or even the direction. It lies in the story. We've all wondered what happens to us after we die. The Lovely Bones suggests that we go to a world that we think is perfect, but we're still haunted by the things that troubled us in our lives. And while the movie leaves you heartbroken, wanting to spend every day you have on this earth as your last, it leaves you pondering your own life, the significance of it, how you'll be remembered. And that's something I particularly like in a film, when it not only moves you to the point where tears are flooding your eyes, but when it leaves you with a great deal of psychological issues to ponder, about your own life, and what comes after your life is ultimately over. And that's what The Lovely Bones does. And while staying true to the source material, that's all a fan of this story can ask for.",1269475200,53,3608,4.577399380804954
3769563,2,B001QOGYAO,"Susie is a 14 year young girl living in the perfect family of 5. Just when she's ready to taste love and her first kiss, she falls victim of a murderer living in her neighbourhood.

She goes to a place between heaven and earth, and hangs out for a while till she is ready to move into Heaven proper. Looks like a real funky place not unlike Disneyworld. Anyway, so we see all the usual ghost story stuff. Dead people unable to leave for some unfinished business, dead people temporarily moving into other people's bodies, etc etc. Add to that a truckload of CGI and you've got yourself a silly story dressed up in some even sillier clothing.

There's a serious issue of losing a child to murder, trying to find the culprit and/or some closure. But there's the totally laughable premise of heaven, in-between, ghosts, and especially the infantile CGI which really makes a mockery of the entire theme.

Interestingly, the actual crafting of the film is not half bad, it has a nice pace, well-made moments. But like another reviewer stated it, good craftsmanship does not a good story make. The whole thing lacks focus even if you would believe in an afterlife.

I've been used to seeing such childish stuff from Peter Jackson, if I had know he was the offender of this particular crime, I would have avoided it no question.",1269475200,3,1321,4.608510638297872

3769586,3,B001QOGYAO,"For all the critical acclaim this movie got, it never was very good. I went with a couple friends to check it out- after seeing the trailer, I thought it looked really good, so we dug into our pockets for the money and went.

When the lights dimmed, and the screen brightened, I was excited.

And when the screen blackened as the lights came back on, I sat there, blank, thinking, huh?

Perhaps one of the more delicate topics to shed light on (I'm guessing certain parents would never dream of wanting to see this movie), this movie had potential. With a curious, unique plot and a blood-chilling villain, it looked good. But there were so many things I didn't like.

First of all, the movie just feels... weird. Maybe it's because it deals with a man who rapes and murders a teenage girl, one of the more horrifying topics, but I always felt uncomfortable in the theater. The scenes were slashed and the whole story felt like long string of tales smashed together. If the director had carved away some of the odd elements of this movie, I think it would have been better.

For example, there is a girl in Susan Salmon's neighborhood who appears to see beyond. But why? We never were explained why this girl could connect to Susan. They had to throw in a lover boy who grieved for Susan- when he says, ""I love you, Susy Salmon,"" I couldn't helping laughing. And really, the whole attempt to connect the living world with the dead is bizarre; somehow Susan watches her father nearly beaten to death by a boy hidden with his lover in the corn stalks (a strange scene in itself), and her world is freaky to the point ""magical"" and ""heavenly"" just don't do it. The ending is awkward and unfair, as the killer seems to get away when throwing Susan's body into a sinkhole, and Susan somehow meets her lover, Ray, one last time- but it made no sense, and I didn't really know what they were getting at.

So the movie isn't terrible- it's just put together weird, and doesn't feel like a real movie. The death of the killer is laughable: he slips when an icicle hits his shoulder, and falls down a cliff where he turns into a faky mess of CG and wax-dummy. The audience is released when Susan's parting words ring in our ears, wishing us a safe and long life or something, and it feels so cheesy.

Now, since I've gotten my ranting done, I can give the reasons this movie isn't a one-star production.

Despite the odd elements, it is a good scary movie, and the fright is well done; I truly felt terrified as Susan sat in the strange underground clubhouse with the killer, her neighbor, alarmingly close. And Stanley Tucci does a great job as the twisted murderer; he may be the shadow of the movie, but he is also the brightest flame that makes this movie watchable. He is obsessed and sick, and well-portrayed. The only protest I have against the killer is that he killed what feels like too many people; as Susan realized the sick truth and walked through his past to see all the women he killed, she just keeps listing names until I began to feel bored. If there's one last scene I could mention, the part when Susan's younger sister begins jogging and is seen running through the park, and Stanley's character is standing perfectly still among the trees, watching, obsessed- wow. One of the scariest scenes I've ever seen.

Anyways, our lead actress, Saorise Ronan, does an okay job as the murdered girl who tries to find her family again; not amazing, but just fine. The dialogue feels choppy at places, but it's passable.

So really? It's not a bad movie. It's a fine movie, but just... bizarre. Not worth the buy, but worth the rent.",1267574400,2,3634,4.492424242424242
3769587,5,B001QOGYAO,"I chose not to read other Amazon reviews because I wanted my opinions to be original, without prejudice. I never read the book. I am, however, familiar with the work of Peter Jackson, and his amazing ability to create a different world, from that which we think we know. ""The Lovely Bones"" is worthy of consideration, from a film perspective. Jackson's apex was the LOTR trilogy, brilliant by any standards. There's a definite look to a Jackson film, mostly the ethereal colors and cinematography, and always a fine script. ""Heavenly Creatures"" brought Jackson to the attention of the American public, followed by the unbelievable ""The Frighteners"", with Michael J Fox, one of the most enjoyable fantasy/adventures  I've ever seen. Other-worldly things seem to project Mr Jackson to greatness, and ""The Lovely Bones"" is no exception. Saoirse Ronan, after an auspicious debut in ""Atonement"" (Oscar nominated) seems a seasoned pro in the central character, complex in her confusion, dissappointment and tremendous love and compassion. I never doubted for a minute that she was talking to me with utmost sincerity. Darlings of the Oscar: Susan Sarandon, Mark Wahlberg, Rachel Weisz are all terrific...add to that newly nominated Stanley Tucci (long overdue) for his oily, snakey and thoroughly fleshed-out performance as the creepy catalyst. Rose McIver is excellent as the younger sister. Whether or not you're comparing the film to the book, this definitely stands on its own as a fine achievement in film-making. Peter Jackson's ability to project the viewer to another place is exceptional. The book may not have been filmed without the vision, sensitivity and grace of a visionary like Mr. Jackson. I enjoyed the film very much.",1267488000,3,1730,5.223021582733813
3769588,2,B001QOGYAO,"""The Lovely Bones"" should have been a great film in the hands of Peter Jackson who had directed acclaimed ""Heavenly Creatures"" back in 1994 (feature debut for Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey). ""Heavenly Creatures"" is a film about intense fantasy and grim reality, some intriguing combination of topics in common with the story of a murdered 14-year-old girl Susie Salmon, the heroine of ""The Lovely Bones."" Sadly, what we have here is a big sloppy mess of a movie that just doesn't know what it wants to do.

Peter Jackson, so intent on the effect-ridden world, never allows us to connect to the characters, including Susie herself. A horrible thing happens to her family, but we don't know much about her parents, young brother and sister. Yes, computer graphics are pretty impressive, but soon we realize this has little to do with the story, or possible themes like metaphorical and spiritual meditation on the loss. Indeed, the story doesn't know where to go, and the film hits the nadir when Susie's free-spirited grandma steps in as ""comic relief."" Judging from this (and the film's cloying finale), Peter Jackson seems to have forgotten that Susie has not just died, but is brutally murdered.

One cannot blame the actors for portraying one-dimensional characters. Saoirse Ronan, so impressive in ""Atonement,"" is pretty good, considering the difficult role she is required to play. Cast-against-type Stanley Tucci is not bad. Actually, he is so good at becoming the character he plays that we start wondering how come people around him missed the obvious thing.

Not having read the original bestselling book, I have nothing to say about the liberties Peter Jackson had taken to film ""The Lovely Bones."" I only imagine that Alice Sebold's book is far more subtle and thought-provoking. The hugely disappointing adaptation is not likely to appeal to either the readers or the viewers.",1267488000,9,1891,5.05448717948718
3769589,3,B001QOGYAO,"""The Lovely Bones"" is an progressively tedious film somewhat redeemed by the second excellent performance in the short career of Saoirse Ronan. Burdened with the tricky task of livening up the solemn 14-year-old Susie Salmon of Alice Sebold's pretentious source novel, Ronan, presumably on wits and instinct, injects a crucial dose of life into a unpleasant, clunky thriller. Her sky blue eyes and eager grin appear to inhabit one film, while director Peter Jackson and the rest of the cast toil away at another. The movie doesn't do justice to her, the overrated book, Heaven, Earth, or anything else.

If you fancied Jackson a top-shelf director, consider ""The Lovely Bones"" a rebuttal. His impulse to veer away from the territory of Sofia Coppola (the perfect match for the novel) is fine. Turning it into a serial killer showcase - replete with a sweaty, bizarre turns from Oscar-nominated Stanley Tucci - is not.

Opening in a Pennsylvania winter, 1973, the movie briefly glimpses the life of Susie (Ronan) a mousy-haired, budding photographer teetering between goofy and artsy, with a crush on an older Indian boy named Ray (Reese Ritchie) on whom she spies at the mall. Her mom Abigail (Rachel Weisz) and dad Jack (Mark Wahlberg) are ex-intellectuals who border on eccentric. Abigail's mom Lynn (Susan Sarandon) is a blowsy booze hound. Susie has a brother and sister, a new stocking cap with a jingle bell in it, and a date with Ray, Saturday, in the mall gazebo.

And then she's raped and killed by George Harvey (Tucci), a dollhouse maker who lives down the street. Mr. Harvey - as he's known in the book - builds an underground clubhouse in an empty cornfield, and lures Susie into it. Although Jackson shows little of the violence - for some reason, this irked critics who apparently require, for the sake of fidelity, the disgusting sights and sounds of a girl getting raped - we get the picture well enough when Susie's elbow is recovered by a police dog.

Plot? Oh, there's a truckload. ""The Lovely Bones"" is not a short film. Susie heads to a colorful, yet fearsome ""holding pen"" between Earth and Heaven. Father Jack searches for the killer with a detective (Michael Imperioli) while Abigail mourns in silence. At some point, Sarandon's character, cigarette and sherry at the ready, moves in. Abigail moves out. Sister Lindsey (Rose McIver) matures into a young woman. Susie spies on her family and, in the briefest of moments, influences them. Meanwhile, Mr. Harvey eludes capture and plots a new murder, while reliving his pleasure in Susie's.

Jackson pushes so many emotional and visual buttons - he aims for an epic amidst intense personal drama - that he loses track of the story, and ends up lingering on the faces of his two best performers: Ronan - open, searching, evocative - and Tucci - leering, maniacal and sweaty.

Tucci, a superb actor, is given the thankless role of a remarkably obvious weirdo - balding, pudgy, raspy-voiced, slightly effeminate - who appears to possess supernatural abilities to detect movement and remain invisible in plain sight. In other words, he's a bogeyman complete with lurches, grimaces and growls. Jackson likes to position the camera just below Tucci's nostrils, or in super close-up of Tucci's thumb as he caresses the key charm on Susie's bracelet.

I understand why he resorts to repetitive stock shots. Sebold's novel is a Literary Work; that is, the kind of book that trots out poet Juan Ramon Jimenez on its first page, and Erica Jong not long after. What's ""profound"" about the book isn't its commentary on grief - it's the usual anger, confusion, guilt and strife - but its conceit of putting a smart kid in a postmodern heaven with murky rules and ""literary"" trappings. It's a mildly clever dirge, in other words, with a handful of exceptionally-written passages. So the minute Jackson commanded an army of CGI for Susie's heaven, he was stuck trying to dramatize Earth, too - and those roads lead to Mr. Harvey`s subplot. Sebold's novel is modest and minor. Jackson's bold, broad brush strokes are a bad fit .

But that doesn't excuse a chase scene heading for a climax, only to be interrupted, at the very second of the big reveal, by a family reunion. Or jaw-dropping lapses of consistency, as when it takes two men several minutes - in slow motion - to flip a safe, end over end, into a sinkhole, when Mr. Harvey must have carried it from his basement by himself in the previous scene. Or when Mr. Harvey leaves his house for what appears to be a location scouting trip only to return minutes later, without the incriminating items he took with him. There's a good half-hour of this slasher nonsense.

""The Lovely Bones,"" then, reduces best to a series of moments, most of them involving Ronan. Susie's aborted kiss with Ray is just a masterwork of tenderness and timidity, while Susie's eventual entrance into Heaven possesses, surprisingly, the power we hoped it might. The Heaven in Sebold's book belongs to no religion; Jackson's movie makes subtle nods toward Christianity - the tree of life, a little girl's earrings - without underlining in a way that would turn off most agnostic (or just plain childish) reviewers. Wahlberg lacks dramatic heft but you like him anyway, while Weisz's considerable skills go largely unused. (Her effortless beauty doesn't.) Time for Sarandon to retire. Tucci, worthy of pity, earns his Oscar nod in the sense that he commits himself to looking like a nerd, irritates the heck out of the viewer and fully deserves his bloody demise at film's end. You're supposed to hate the guy. And...you do.",1267488000,,5609,4.871069182389937
3769590,2,B001QOGYAO,"My mother and I saw the previews for The Lovely Bones one day, and they caught both of our interests. We decided to read the book BEFORE we saw the movie, so collectively we read the book in a week and a half.

Alice Sebold's book was amazingly descriptive, heartwrenching, and a true work of art. She draws Suzie's expiriences from her own life. The Lovely Bones was excellent, a book I will make my children and my grandchildren read when the time comes. I feel that this novel is an important piece of art that benefits the American culture a great deal. There's nothing I can say but I LOVED the book.

So we went to the movie, expecting differences between movie and book as every book-to-screen adventure has. But this movie...it was NOTHING like the book. It follows obvious plot lines, such as Suzie's rape and murder, and her kinship with Holly and Ray, and her family's quest to right the wrong that was her violent murder.

Some of the things that weren't quite right: I may be wrong about this fact, but Holly was not murdered by George Harvey. Where was Franny, Suzie's intake counselor? And when, in the book, did Ruth ever live by the sinkhole? One of my favorite characters was little Buck, and he was in it for about five minutes, and then we didn't see him again, at all.

There were some redeeming qualities about this movie, though. One of which is Susan Serandon's portrayl of Suzie's grandmother. She is such a great actress and I loved everything about the way she played her role. Another was Mark Wahlberg as Suzie's father. He carried across the emotions from the book to a T, and his expressions were amazing. And Lindsay was great, too. The best scene in the whole movie was the break-in at Mr. Harvey's. Which leads me to Stanley Tucci. I already knew he was a great actor BEFORE I set out to see this movie, but I was several pegs above impressed. His portrayal of Mr. Harvey was stupendous, and if this movie doesn't get him the highest award of awards. AMAZING.

And the most disturbing of all: Suzie's heaven. It was never fantastical or full of things you wouldn't find anywhere else. Suzie's heaven was a demonstration of how her life would have gone if she hadn't died.

While this movie wasn't top notch, it was still alright and worthy of some acknowledgements. The emotions in the movie were pure and raw and Suzie's narrations really created a mood of mystery and desperation. Saorise Ronan is a blooming actress and she will go quite far in her career.

It's beautiful, it's haunting, it's the kind of film you cannot walk away from and not be moved by it or dare I say even changed by it.  Susie did an awesome job acting and should have been nominated by the Oscars as she was by the Golden Globes.  Her murderer was rightly so nominated.  It departs somewhat from the book, if you recently read the book and then see the movie, the departures may bother you.  Best case scenario is if you see the movie first or haven't read the book in many years and then see the movie.  I love both the book and the movie.  While this is fiction, it takes a subject that we all know is quite real and it does so, so beautifully, so eloquently, so respectfully, I dare you to watch this movie and walk away with a dry eye and unaffected.

3769592,1,B001QOGYAO,"ok, first, let me say I am a huge fan of Peter Jackson. I would probably say he is my favorite filmmaker, actually. He is without a doubt one of the most visionary directors of our time. so many classics; Dead Alive, Heavenly Creatures, need I even mention the LOTR? Also, I read the book of ""The Lovely Bones"", and i thought it was very good. So i was very excited to hear the Peter Jackson would be turning into a film, then, i saw it.

There is so much wrong with it, were to begin? First, character development. At no point do you really know why anyone is doing anything. The main characters sister's motivations are the most puzzling. Bizzare attempts at levity only make the audience feel strange and awkward, as clearly the actors must have felt when filming it. The laughably bad acting of mark walberg only adds to this. And the ending made absolutly no sense at all, it felt so rushed and sudden. And of course the strange thing that happens with he main characters love interest, i don't want to say more because i don't want to give any spoilers.

This film failed on every level. The most notable, for me at least, was its complete inability to connect with the audience on an emotional level. The script was so badly throw together that it made it impossible to care about what was happening on screen. Im not some ogre, i do tear up in movies when its appropriate, but in this case it was impossible. I really don't understand it when i hear people talk about how they cried throughout the whole film, that really makes no sense to me at all.

I don't know what kind of moronic yes men told Peter Jackson this was a good movie, but he knows, his collaborators knows, and I know how bad it really was. PJ, if your reading this, for the love of god, please make your next movie a good one, your career might be depending on it.",1266883200,25,1841,4.3304347826086955
3769593,2,B001QOGYAO,"""The Lovely Bones"" is about Susie Salmon, who after being raped and murdered, watches from heaven as her family and friends try to move on with their lives and she comes to terms with her death. Oscar nominee Saoirse Ronan is Susie; Rachel Weisz is her mother Abby; Mark Wahlberg is father Jack; Susan Sarandon is Susie's grandmother, Lynn; and Stanley Tucci is George Harvey, Susie's rapist.

First of all I have to speak on the odd casting. I think the parents should have been older, but that's just me. Ryan Gosling was originally picked to play Jack, but turned it down because he thought he was too young.

Second, Lynne Ramsay had been, for years, readying to adapt Alice Sebold's novel, but didn't get a chance to, which I think is a shame. Peter Jackson did not do this story justice. He should really stick to hobbits. Most of the movie is spent on fantasy elements instead of the characters or story. Jackson makes it seem like Susie was happy to have been raped and murdered. He spent five years writing the screenplay and he should've did more with the dialogue instead of focusing on only the special effects. The ending of the movie is just as laughable. Good acting from Ronan and Tucci, but a big disappointment.",1266537600,9,1229,4.607305936073059

3769605,3,B001QOGYAO,"The fantasized perfection that is Lord of the Rings has not translated well to The Lovely Bones, whatsoever. I'm not entirely sure what Peter Jackson was trying to accomplish but in the end, The Lovely Bones is just a plain, weird film with fantastical elemets that seem entirely out of place.

I have not read the book the film is based on, but from what I do know, it was changed up quite a bit. Either way, movie-wise, it is a big dissapointment. For a film that deals with a murdered child, a distraught family and a perverted serial killer, there isn't that much drama or mystery surrounding it.

Saorise Ronan plays said murdered child, and she narrates the story from a heaven-type of place. She watches over her confused family and wishes for a life she can never have. It SHOULD be depressing and morose and painful, but I felt nothing of that. Is the movie a fantasy? Is it a mystery thriller? A redemption tale? It is very hard to place and the pacing really throws everything off. The killer is revealed, purposefully, pretty much in the beginning so suspense-wise, there isn't much there.

The main problem, I think, lies with the fact that too much time was spent in the fantasy world which doesn't do much for the rest of the picture. It is two different worlds and they didn't mix all that well. I felt dissapointed as I had high hopes for this, especially after utterly adoring the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Even Jackson's earlier and brilliant Heavenly Creatures mixed elements of fantasy with perfect drama and it worked beautifully. Here, it falls flat and just feels plain odd. And the ending didn't help matters either. Hopefully, Jackson will get it right the next time around.",1265587200,4,1701,4.644518272425249

I found myself holding my breath not wanting to even breathe for fear of missing the moment, to take in the scenes (and there are so many amazing ones). This movie had scenes that really touched my heart and if you really stop to think about the symbolism you will appreciate Peter Jackson's work! And let me just say Peter Jackson is amazing he was diligent in paying attention to details, like the way he angled the camera putting you in the mind and shoes of a 14 year old girl, the magnifying effect was just so heart palpitating...the usage of sound making things magnified 10xs to put you in that state of fear and the unknowing. It was just crushing seeing how much Suzie just wanted to get home (what 14 yr old...heck any age...doesn't want to be safe with home and family?) The direction was great at letting the viewer sense the overwhelming WANT of a little girl's defiance to leave her family, friends and everything she loves and wanted to accomplish because some MAN got an itch to do atrocious things to little girls. Every child molester should watch this movie to get a different perspective (the victim's perspective) This movie really helps you value life and be thankful there is still time for you...so do things you wanted to! Do things you love and care about! And do yourself a favor...WATCH THE MOVIE! I guarantee everyone will come out feeling SOMETHING and if not than you are probably heartless and have no imagination and that being the case I feel sorry for you, sorry that you aren't even LIVING life!

3769607,3,B001QOGYAO,"""The Lovely Bones"" is a memorable book; the narrator, a fourteen-year-old girl is dead and tells the story of her death and how her parents cope with the tragedy. If anyone might seem to be the perfect choice to adapt this book to the big screen, it is probably Peter Jackson, the force behind the enormously successful ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.

But there is just something wrong with the movie adaptation. It just doesn't work as well as you would expect or hope for from a director of his caliber and his writing partner, both of whom worked together of enormously successful collaborations in the past.

1973. Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan, ""Atonement"") lives happily with her mom and dad (Rachel Weisz and Mark Wahlberg) and her brother and sister. One day, taking a short cut home from school, she walks across an abandoned cornfield and meets one of the neighbors, Mr. Harvey (Stanley Tucci). Mr. Harvey has been watching Susie and wants to become her friend. In fact, he is excited to show her a little clubhouse he has built for the neighborhood children. Would she like to see it? It isn't far. In fact, it is built in a hole in the field they are currently walking across. Susie is eager to see it and follows Mr. Harvey into his clubhouse. But things quickly go wrong. Later that evening, Mom and Dad begin to get worried when Susie doesn't come home. She is a good kid and doesn't normally come home late. They call the police and Detective Fenerman (Michael Imperioli) arrives to help them out. When Susie doesn't show up and they can't find her, Jack and Abigail begin to unwind so Grandma Lynn (Susan Sarandon) comes to help out, to take care of her other two grandchildren, Susie's younger sister and brother. Susie is watching all of this from the ""In Between"", narrating the story of her life and death for us, giving us a look into how this family copes with the loss of a loved one.

Set in the early 70s, the film is a fairly straightforward narrative; a family mourns the loss of their fourteen-year-old daughter. When Susie dies, and begins to narrate the story for us, this makes everything more interesting and more intimate. Because she is viewing everything from the ""In Between"", Susie has knowledge about everything affecting her family, giving us an intimate knowledge of their emotions and feelings. This allows the author and filmmaker a certain amount of creative license; for the author, she can give us details we would not necessarily have otherwise. For the filmmaker, it allows him a little license to interpret, to be creative, to play with his special effects toy box. But Jackson takes this license too far. Yes, the film is set in the early 70s, but despite the high production value, as Susie and her new friends (other teenagers caught in the ""In-Between"") begin to explore their new landscape, it looks like a cross between ""The Lord of the Rings"" and a flashback Greg Brady might have after sniffing too much glue while making a model airplane with his brothers. They walk through lush green hills, past burbling brooks of crystal clear water. All of this instantly brings to mind the lushness of the New Zealand landscape featured so prominently in the director's films. But Susie looks into the water and sees a giant rose blooming under the surface. Another time, she is walking past huge glass ships that begin to crash into one another. It just seems a little too ""Hippy Dippy"".

As in the book, you know from a very early stage who kills Susie. And Stanley Tucci's portrayal of Mr. Harvey is the best thing in the film. Suitably creepy, it is easy to see how someone who is innocent or unsuspecting might fall for his trap. He seems nice, so it doesn't seem like a huge stretch when Susie agrees to go and look at his new clubhouse. And when Tucci has to turn on the creeps, he is able to do that. Years after Susie's murder, Harvey returns home and suspects something. He sits silently at his dining room table, his ears alert. Finally, he hears a noise and springs into action.

Saoirse Ronan is also very good at portraying all of the values you would expect in this girl. Mom forces her to wear a knitted cap a relative has made for her, she appears even more innocent than she already is. But the fact Susie reluctantly puts this on, after leaving school, shows she is not a very rebellious sort, even at fourteen. She trusts people and doesn't really have a lot of reason to not trust people. Yet. But unfortunately, she will learn too late.

It is also nice to see how her unrequited love for the new student at her school is handled. She is instantly attracted to Ray Singh (Reece Richie), a handsome boy who has recently moved to the small town from London. Admiring him from afar, she doesn't have the courage to approach him. Then, he makes the first move and this makes Susie swoon. She dreamily thinks of Ray as she takes a shortcut home from school. She is in such a good mood, she takes a few extra minutes to check out the new clubhouse Mr. Harvey has built.

Susan Sarandon is amusing as the grandmother who realizes she has to suddenly act like a grandmother, to help her grieving family. She is quite a sight to watch; Grandma Lynn vacuums the floor with a cigarette dangling from her lips and a glass of scotch nearby. Grandma would rather be doing a lot of things and we instantly realize domestic chores are at the bottom of the list.

Mark Wahlberg seems out of place as Jack, the patriarch of the family. He just doesn't seem like an adult and he seems like a teenager playing the head of the family in a high school play. It doesn't help that he is unable to change anything about his voice, to reflect any of the differing emotions he has throughout the story.

Michael Imperioli plays Len Fenerman, the detective assigned to the case. Throughout the film, Imperioli seems to miss some key moments to demonstrate any emotion for his character. Jack pesters the detective with his theories and ideas about Susie's disappearance. He just calmly listens. When the case goes nowhere, he seems quietly resigned. When they close in on a suspect, he doesn't seem all that excited. When he interviews Mr. Harvey, his suspicions aren't raised, so you begin to wonder if he is any good at his job.

It's too bad that so many people in the film seem to have been directed to play everything low key and with so little emotion. This is a story about a family who loses one of their own, why shouldn't there be some emotion, some fury. Wahlberg shouts a little, but it isn't enough and isn't very believable. Weisz, who plays Abigail, the mom, is okay, but she isn't very emotional either. In fact, Abigail leaves the family at one point, unable to deal with all of the emotions. Without any apparent emotion, the end just falls flat and doesn't register with the intensity you would hope for or expect.

3769609,2,B001QOGYAO,"This movie doesn't come close to doing justice to Alice Sebold's extraordinary book.  While it has a lot of lovely special effects, the gist of the story falls flat; the excitement is gone.

The story is about a young girl who is murdered by a serial killer.  Her family is torn apart by the ordeal and each of them, in their own way, can't get over the murder.  The murdered girl watches over her family from a semi-heaven as she, too, can't fully let go of  her life.  The actors in the movie (Mike Wahlberg, Susan Sarandon, Rachel Weisz, Stanley Tucci) are usually top-notch.  However, in this film, their performances are rote.  The only performance that stands out is Stanley Tucci's as the creepy murderer.

I recommend you see this on DVD or skip it altogether.  Do yourself a favor and read the book.  It's astonishingly beautiful.",1264723200,4,839,4.639455782312925
3769610,3,B001QOGYAO,"THE LOVELY BONES isn't really a bad movie, exactly.  It's not even fair to say that it's a disappointment (although I had certainly hoped to be moved more by it), because as I think back on my feelings after reading the book, there were flaws aplenty there as well.  Unfortunately, the flaws seem more obvious on screen and the strengths fade somewhat to the background.

Set in the 1970's, THE LOVELY BONES introduces us to the Salmon family.  Jack, the father (Mark Wahlberg) is an accountant, and mother Abigail (Rachel Weisz) stays home.  There a young son, a middle sister Lindsey (Rose McIver) and oldest sister Susie (Saoirse Ronan from ATONEMENT), who is about 14 or so.  They live in a nice, suburban neighborhood, wear nice earth-tone, corduroy clothing we associate with that time, and they have small arguments and little joys.  They also live down the street from George Harvey (Stanley Tucci), a mild-mannered loner...who one afternoon after school murders young Susie as she's walking home across a dried-out cornfield.

Because it's the `70s, there isn't yet a CSI to descend upon the scene, and as a body is not recovered...the investigation, led by Len Fenerman (Michael Imperioli) never gets anywhere near enough evidence to point them to the killer.

The Salmon family begins to unravel, as one can easily imagine any family doing in such horrible circumstances.  When Abigail's mom Lynn (Susan Sarandon) shows up to supervise the household, the results are both hurtful and helpful.

All of this would alone be enough for a potentially powerful story.  But the story also posits that we see much of it from the eyes of Susie, who is not quite able to move on to heaven because she is anxious to see her murderer brought to justice and to see her family achieve some kind of peace.  Her ""in-between"" location is a constantly changing marvel of CGI landscapes, full of beauty (Susie more or less conjures up her surroundings) and full of portentous metaphors.

This device, in the book, was interesting but not very gripping, to be honest.  Susie is dead and unable to really influence the world she sees.  We understand that she needs closure in order to move on to heaven...but it's hard to really get emotionally involved with that dilemma.  Yes, it's awful that she was killed...but knowing the heaven truly awaits her makes her ""torment"" merely seem inconvenient for her.  I don't mean to sound callous...but we know that an eternally happy ending awaits her.  It is the torment of those she's left behind that is the real power of the story.  These are emotions we can relate to.  And when the book explored them, we could be readily gripped by their power.  A father obsessed with investigating the crime.  A mother who can't even stand to live in the same house anymore...not only because of her missing child, but her distant husband.  A younger sister ripped by grief but also by resentment at the childhood she is missing.  A grandmother who is more accustomed to drinking and smoking and indulging, suddenly forced to step up and be a better mother than she had been before.  A cop emotionally shredded by his inability to make headway.  And a cold-blooded killer living in comfort down the street.  In the book, a fair balance is struck between the lives of those on earth, and the observations of young Susie looking down.

Writer / director Peter Jackson's singular mistake with the film is to let Susie's world and voice play a far more dominant role than in the book.  Some have complained that too much time is spent ""wowing"" us with the world Susie lingers in.  I didn't mind the scenery...it's just that we spent too much time there.  And Ronan's voiceovers are constant throughout the film...she's telling us the story, and this removes us somewhat from simply FEELING things.

There is power in the film.  The moments leading up to Susie's attack, when she goes against her own best judgment and allows herself to be cornered by Harvey are horribly effective.  Some have had the nerve to criticize that we don't see the actual attack.  I was worked up enough without that, thank you very much.  There are little moments of raw emotion throughout the film.

But by bringing things to the screen, THE LOVELY BONES feels less like a story of a family than it does a ghost story.  Various characters get glimpses of Susie.  Near the end, there is a ludicrous scene when Susie is, more or less, able to come back for a moment.  There appears to be a smidge of supernatural intervention in what happens to Harvey.  None of this was needed, because Jackson should have trusted to a simpler story and let his stellar cast go to town.  Mark Wahlberg shows us the anguish and guilt he feels...and given more script time, might have developed a truly unforgettable performance.  The normally reliable Weisz actually is given little to do, and Sarandon is saddled with a caricature rather than a character.  Imperioli was born to play this role, but instead, it is underwritten and generic.

Yet I must point out that the movie IS worth seeing, if only for 3 performances.  Young Rose McIver as the surviving sister feels remarkably grounded in her performance.  Her character is able to move on with her life, yet Susie is always a presence to her and she carried a healthy dose of anger with her.  She brings some real drama to the latter portion of the film.  Young Ronan is a striking presence, and while I disagree vehemently with how much voiceover time she is given...she does excellent work.  And best of all is Stanley Tucci, playing one of the creepiest killers we've seen in a long, long time.  Awards will come his way...but if the movie around him had been a little better, his psycho would  be right up there with the likes of Hannibal Lecter...except his character is cringingly credible.  Tucci is the actor of 2009, with his stellar work opposite Meryl Streep in JULIE & JULIA (where he is so likeable) and in LOVELY BONES, where the sickness practically drips from him.

So see LOVELY BONES for its good moments and performances, but also mourn what COULD have been if character had been allowed to win over the supernatural.",1264636800,,6172,4.744600938967136

3769613,4,B001QOGYAO,"I never read the novel, so that might be the reason I'm not as critical as most when it comes to The Lovely Bones. Peter Jackson as many critics have now said, may not have been the perfect fit for this movie. He is a wonderful visual director, but his vision of the in-between feels out oddly out of place. The CGI is well done and quite beautiful, but it did nothing more than distract me from the characters that I was beginning to care about. Thankfully these sequences were just short enough to not ruin the experience. The acting was pretty solid. Mark Wahlberg is often hit or miss, but he was suprisingly believable here. Susan Sarandon provided some offbeat humor and Rachel Weisz was decent, even though her role was thinly written. The two standouts were Saorise Ronan and Stanley Tucci. I see a big career in the future for this young actress. There is something about her that grabs and holds your attention. Stanley Tucci was creepy to the core, though I find it hard to believe that anyone would think he was normal. The way he looked and interacted with people should have sent up major red flags. There were two scenes of suspense involving his character that were well executed. The music hit the right emotional notes when needed and the story itself proved horrific enough to make a strong impact on me.

The Lovely Bones is getting bashed way too heavily by most critics. I know it has its share a flaws, but the fact that I was thinking about the film all the way home from the theater shows the true power it possesses if you go in with an open mind.

3769614,4,B001QOGYAO,"I'm a fan of the book this movie is based on, and although Peter Jackson took some liberties with the story, the result was an emotional and visually stunning film. ""The Lovely Bones"" tells the story of Suzie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan), a 14-year-old girl who is murdered by a neighborhood predator (Stanley Tucci). As the Salmon family copes with their tragedy, Susie's spirit hovers in the ""in-between"" that exists between heaven and Earth. Unable to let go of her previous life, Susie keeps a watchful eye on her family and her murderer, hoping that justice will ultimately be served and that she and her loved ones can finally move on.

I appreciated that the film didn't show Susie's violent murder on screen, which would have been extremely disturbing. The film does a fantastic job of portraying Susie in her in-between world, which is beautiful to watch. I wish Susan Sarandon was given more screen time, because she is hilarious in her role as the drunk grandmother. Tucci gives a terrifying portrayal of a child killer, and Ronan's performance as Susie is very understated and sincere.

And they are more bad than good.

I saw the film and i've read the book. I thought it was a great and fateful adaptation. Very, very sensitive and beautiful. Beautiful in it's sadness, of course. I seem to remember that they was a little fling between the mother and the detective in the novel, though. That wasn't in the movie and that was the only point i miss cause it showed... well, i don't really know what it showed but it seemed ""real"" nonetheless.

Real. That is the word here.

This film, like the novel, blends real life and fantasy. The fantasy part is of course well made. But i do agree that it was too long. More sad than joyful, really. I do think that it was the point as the main character isn't accepting her death. But i can't understand how some folks actually thinks that this is Heaven. The book AND the movie are clear about what this is.

As for the ""real"" life stuff, people act in ways that are not always logic or cinematic. All the characters in this film have their incongruities and weak points. I thought it was refreshing to not have all of them come full circle in a hollywood-type-of-ending. They are hurt. And in their hurting, they are also hurting their loved ones. They don't conclude their ""story-arc"" with cheap morals. They won't have peace but they will have to learn to live with their pain.

When the movie ends, i am left wondering what was it all for? Why write this? Why make this? After all, other movies about this subject have been made. Why this one? Was it so necessary? Why would Peter Jackson and Steven Spielberg be so interrested in this strange, mournful fantasy?

I am not sure i have the answer and i'm not even sure it matters that much. I think that it's a story about grief, about mourning and about real life - even though it deals with the notion of afterlife. Real life in the sense that after the film or the book ends, these characters will go on with their pain. And we, as spectators, weren't lectured or moralized. We simply were voyeurs and we take whatever we have to take from this moment we spent with these characters.

The Lovely Bones. A nice word ""lovely"" and a more dark one ""bones"". Good and bad. Both of them in our life. In our deaths. In our interactions. In our grief. I don't know. I'm thinking out loud, here. I don't have a specific answer. It's blur.

We went in. We come out and we're not sure what we're feeling.

And i do think it was the intention.

As the main character says in the end: ""I hope you have a good life"".",1263859200,,2922,4.335164835164835
3769626,4,B001QOGYAO,"Lovely Bones, directed by Peter Jackson, winner of three Oscars for his Lord of the Rings movies, director of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/King-Kong-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JO20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">King Kong (Widescreen Edition)</a>.  LB features Oscar winning actresses, Rachel Weisz, and Susan Sarandon.  Lead actress, Saoirse Ronan won a nomination for her supporting role in Atonement.

When a creepy neighbor kills a 14 year old girl, she gets caught in the in between world between heaven and earth. One wonders if the killer will be brought to justice, or will he continue his behavior unabated, and who might be next, and what will finally release her from her bonds to earth.

As you watch, Lovely Bones explore themes of spirituality, forgiveness and justice.  If you're wondering, it does not go into the gore and violence of her death, and like all such stories, if you care to look beyond the surface, and go deeper it has a cautionary tale to tell.  It might be instructive for a teenage girl, who, maybe is unsuspecting, to watch a movie like this, and for her parent to make a point of watching it.  It's good to know that while such things do happen, they are not common occurences.

In this movie, Peter Jackson creates a symbolic world of subconscious imagination and imagery, like snippets from a dream, so our girl lives in the in between, partly the creation of her own imagination, and partly the creation of her grieving father, with whom she has a close connection. So, while there is no direct communication by word, there is recurring symbolic communication, and you can notice many things.

You can notice, corn on the table, a cornfield, just planted and mature and inviting, a love letter that flutters through the breeze, and lands in different hands, a safe where remains can be kept, a trophy taken from a girl, and will the killer accidentally get caught with it.  You can notice lighthouses, the same tree, roses blooming and decadent, figurines, a safe, a sink hole, a street map that looks like a Film Four logo.  Hmm. Lighthouse Entertainment.  Hmm.

There are even parallels between the girl's father and killer. Both like to make small intricate models, and this becomes interesting when the ships appear. Ships in a bottle, ok.  Dolls houses not ok.

I particularly liked the performance of Mark Wahlberg, who emotes without overstating. Stanley Tucci, goes against his usual type, and gives a perfectly creepy performance as the killer.  He might even get an Oscar nomination. I found Rachel Weisz performance odd but very intriguing, somewhat under emotive or under acted.  I found the alternative world interesting, reminiscent of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-Dreams-May-Come/dp/B00007GZR5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What Dreams May Come</a>, which was more visually compelling, although a very heavy movie.

One thing that did not make sense was the safe.  This hugely heavy box, he is able to put in an underground structure, put the bones in, yet is unable to move the safe by himself, so how does he get it to his house, how does he get it out of his basement and into his car, yet he needs help moving it a few yards to a sink hole.

I liked this movie a lot, although it was a bit long, and there was too much narrating by the girl.  Part of the fun of watching a movie is your own imaginary experience, and a lighter touch on the narration would have worked  much better. I wonder if you found this review helpful..",1263686400,8,3574,5.125862068965517
3769627,3,B001QOGYAO,"As the story opens, the narrator, 14-year old Susie, tells us she was murdered.  We then see a cringe-worthy scene (that doesn't actually show any violence) and Susie leaves earth for ""the in-between;"" a nice place, but not quite heaven.  She watches her family as they cope with her death and the years pass.

I liked the book a lot, which is odd considering it's about a girl who is horrifically killed by a pervert.  Except for that one scene, however, the book was uniformly upbeat and uplifting and brought me to happy tears.  Susie loved being in her heaven, which looked like her beloved school and she could order peppermint ice cream anytime and never get told, ""It's seasonal.""  The movie changes quite a lot of important plot points, the most notable being that Susie's ""in-between"" is set in a big field amid beautiful mountains, but she's not happy there and is usually agitated or confused.  Instead of being joyous, the movie was very scary and relentlessly sad.

Young Saoirse Ronan (already an Oscar-nominee) is perfectly cast as Susie - all wide-eyed innocence.  Stanley Tucci is subtly creepy as her killer, but wasn't quite loony enough.  Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz were too young and beautiful to play her parents, and Susan Sarandon was obnoxious as her grandmother.  Several characters who played key parts in the book were reduced to bit parts.  The movie was very intense, but also very depressing, while the book left me comforted.

Bottom line:  If you haven't read the book, you may well find this movie enthralling.  I thought too much emphasis was placed on the strikingly visual after-life, while the hopeful message was missing entirely.",1263513600,11,1673,4.882978723404255

Unfortunately, the dream vistas portrayed detract rather than enhance the plotline of this bittersweet portrayal of Susie, a fourteen-year-old girl played to perfection by Saorise Ronan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Atonement-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B0013XZ6X4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Atonement (Widescreen Edition)</a>) whose murder by quintessential creepy Mr. Harvey (stellar Stanley Tucci as the loathsome 40-something loner) wreaks havoc on her otherwise winsome family living in a fairly well depicted early 70s suburbia.  As in the novel, Susie narrates her story from the vantage point of a confused child taken from life before her time, distraught over the injustice and waste of precious moments that she has not yet had time to experience.  However, whereas moments of Susie's revelation with regard to her limbo status--she does not want to leave the realm of her family or friends without facilitating some revenge on her killer--would have sufficed nicely complete with dreamscape scenes reminiscent of Vincent Ward's hokey albeit sunlit vision in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-Dreams-May-Come/dp/B00007GZR5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What Dreams May Come</a>,"" Jackson's interminable version of psychedelic landscape after symbolic panorama stuns the audience with too many images that somehow manage to induce sleep rather than awe.

Jackson, who co-wrote the screenplay with Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, attempts to faithfully follow the novel's guidelines, but fails to create secondary characters worth their salt.  The actors do not fail, but the writing does; the role of the mother, Abigail, played by Rachel Weisz is diminished in this film to the point where it seems unimportant.  The entire relationship between Abigail and Len Fenerman (Michael Imperioli), the caring homicide detective is whittled down to a few heartfelt glances between the characters rather than the emotional affair shared in the novel.  As the father, Mark Wahlberg excels as a frustrated man who loves his family yet fails to protect his oldest daughter.  His scene of incensed rage in the cornfield wielding a baseball bat is powerful yet weakened somehow by the otherworld intervention of dreamscape visuals heralding Susie's invasion on earth action of which she has little control.  Susan Sarandon as Grandma Lynn camps it up as a cigarette-toting alcoholic who means well with her ""tell-it-like-it-is"" attitude but just waxes sadly in too much eyeliner and mascara.

In addition, the novel's symbol of the silver charm on Susie's charm bracelet runs like a leitmotif throughout the film, but has no fundamental raison d'etre other than it acts as a worry bead of sorts for the Harvey character.  I wanted so much for someone to find this charm and connect the dots.  It doesn't happen.

Key scenes with contending boyfriend, Ray Singh (Reece Ritchie) are also omitted--we see his lovely mother floating about in a sari in the mall, but are not treated to her acerbic dialogue from the novel that ties in themes of the disintegrating suburban family during that time period with the general desperation and anger of the novel's other female characters. The closest that we get to glimpse at the idea of woman being burdened by her domestic responsibilities is during the opening credits where Abigail, once a bedtime reader of Camus and Kerouac, switches from her night table stack of esoteric authors to books on babies and child rearing.

Besides Wahlberg, whose slightly earnest post-flower child optimism expertly fades like the rose blooms in Mr. Harvey's front yard, the other actors to be commended are Saorise Ronan and Stanley Tucci.  Tucci, usually suave and debonair, plays oddball Mr. Harvey to frightening perfection.  In one masterful almost Hitchcockian scene, he made my skin crawl as he plays cat and mouse with Detective Fenerman bobbing through the tiny windows of one of the dollhouses he constructs to cover his other more sinister predilections.  Ronan will do great things in the cinema--she has the emotive genius of an actress many years her senior.  Nonetheless in this, her sequences in the netherworld amongst the other murdered victims don't really hit the mark.  I should have been moved to tears at the utter waste of these female lives, but I was not.  I wanted to watch Susie deliver just desserts to Harvey and I wanted this done in a thrilling calculating manner that built to a suspenseful crescendo and then blasted me with a climax that made me cheer from my seat.  This didn't happen.  The novel stretches over a longer period of time and weaves an archeologist's bone necklace that connects all the lives that Susie touched over the long haul.  The film abbreviates an action where unfortunately too much attention was focused on building an adolescent heaven than drawing bonds that connected the cast with the audience in the surging emotions that one would think would transpire.

Bottom line:  ""The Lovely Bones"" is not a great film.  The subject matter obviously cautions anyone of any age to beware of seemingly helpful or amiable strangers.  However, while the script lacks power, cohesiveness and the smack of a satisfying conclusion, the actors especially Tucci and Ronan excel despite the inadequacies of the screenplay.  Jackson's overt use of the wildly imaginative dreamscapes, although beautiful distract rather than add to the overall feel of the story.  Recommended nonetheless.

3769629,3,B001QOGYAO,"Peter Jackson's latest offering, THE LOVELY BONES, is an odd mish-mash of thoughts, images, and plots that we've seen before. The ads for this movie make it sound like the movie Ghost, and in several ways, it's very similar to Ghost. You have a murder, a stuck spirit, a sort of medium/ghost whisperer, and a final release. You even have a spirit affecting the material world, albeit to a lesser degree than Patrick Swayze's character did. And that's the problem, at least for me, with this flick. The murdered girl's spirit interacts with the physical world only twice, and one of those instances really left me scratching my head wondering who thought that scene was a good idea.

In the rest of THE LOVELY BONES, when we see the spirit of the young girl, I kept expecting to see Robin Williams ala What Dreams May Come. She's often portrayed as just kickin' it around in Heaven, frolicking about in the sun, with nary a thought for her family on Earth. It's boring really, since it doesn't advance the plot and really adds little or nothing to the film. There are some special effects that are interesting, but they are odd and isolated. Again, why? (As an aside, I did notice what seemed to be three Easter Eggs in Heaven, but probably weren't. They were all logos for film production companies: the tree logo from The Ladd Company, the lighthouse logo for Castle Rock Entertainment, and the classic Paramount logo.)

So what did I like about THE LOVELY BONES? Cinematography/atmosphere and Stanley Tucci.

The cinematographers and set designers for THE LOVELY BONES nailed the 1970s; the atmosphere and sense of time and place was darned near perfect. It was eerie, really. I felt like I was watching my parents' old home movies. The main character has an instamatic that she's always using. Whenever she snaps it, they show the photo in the old faded Kodachrome discoloration we're all familiar with. Really impressive. I'll also mention here Susan Sarandon's impressive portrayal of a Jackie O acolyte (at least outwardly). She, too, looked, to me, exactly like who she was supposed to be. I actually loved that she smoked and drank.

But the real gem of THE LOVELY BONES isn't Sarandon or Markie Mark or even top-billed Saoirse Ronan. It was Stanley Tucci. You may know him as Doctor Moretti on ER. I had just watched his low-key performance as Julia Child's supportive and loving husband in Julie and Julia. But I had to do a double-take when I saw him here. While his character's hobby reminds me of a few episodes of CSI, he is fresh as the creepy neighbor/serial killer. I've never seen him play anything like this and he was 100% convincing. I wanted very bad things to happen to him. My skin is still crawling.

Would I pay to see THE LOVELY BONES again? No. Would I watch it again if a friend really wanted me to? Once more, perhaps. But if you really want to watch a great movie in a very similar vein, go rent Stir of Echoes.

PS - I saw that No Country For Old Men was on TV today. For free. I'd watch THE LOVELY BONES again, like 7 times, before watching FRIENDO again, if that helps.",1263254400,6,3103,4.602169981916817
3769630,3,B001QOGYAO,"***NOTE: This movie does not come out in theatres until January 15th. However, as you internet pirates may or may not know, a high quality screener is floating around the net, which is how I got to see it.***

Peter Jackson is a visual artist, albeit with a strange way of transitioning into Hollywood. He started off with a 4-years-in-the-making gore film called ""Bad Taste"", which was his debut. He has since then made a hilarious puppet satire called ""Meet the Feebles"", the goriest movie ever ""Dead Alive"", and disturbing drama, ""Heavenly Creatures"". What's strange is that in this wake, he managed to transition into Hollywood movies, beginning with ""The Frighteners"". Then came LOTR and King Kong. And now, The Lovely Bones walk among us.

I, admittedly, have not read the book by Alice Sebold, but I do plan on reading it one day. I saw the trailer with a showing of ""The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day"" and decided it looked good. So last night I sat down to watch The Lovely Bones, and prepared myself for a real experience. And after the movie was done, I thought it was good... but that's where it stopped. While this is gorgeous visually, unfortunately in terms of storytelling it seems rather weak. Which is a shame since this movie is one with much potential.

The movie centers around Susie Salmon, a pretty girl who lives with her family in 1973. She is 14 and lives a very happy life. She is very interested in photography, and has developed quite a knack for it- She is seen taking pictures of herself, of her surroundings, of several things that are beautiful to her. She even has a crush on a handsome British guy named Ray, who sets up a meet-up in the gazebo at the local mall. One day, on her way home from school, she comes across an unsuspecting man named Mr. Harvey, who is a carpenter. He has built a fort for kids to hang out and decides to show it to her. While in the fort, Susie realizes she's being reeled into a trap, upon trying to escape, she has been murdered.

Her family, after hearing of the news, has a hard time trying to accept it and let her go. At the same time, having grandma over sure is quite odd- but it doesn't seem to be filling in the gaping hole left in the family. Nobody knows that Mr. Harvey is the one who killed her. Yet at the same time, he does come off as quite suspicious. Whereas in the afterlife, Susie is in a mysterious and magical world, her definition of a ""perfect world"". She has met other murder victims there too. Yet somehow she manages to see her family, and her family manages to see her. But her dad, played by Mark Wahlberg, has a tough time letting her go.

The Lovely Bones is quite a visual marvel- Jackson clearly has a great eye for shot and several of the film's scenes prove it. However, it's rather unfortunate that the story, while good, is rather weakly executed at best. It seems as if Jackson suddenly forgot what the story was and decided to fill in the blanks with some gorgeous CG. And while it is gorgeous, it can't make up for a bit of a lack in plot. It's lovely in visuals, but bones in storytelling, which does seem to drag the movie down a bit, because Jackson has managed to adapt Lord of the Rings and King Kong quite well.

That isn't, however, to say the movie is bad. It's far from it. The main reason to see this, IMO, is the performances from Ronan and Sarandon- both manage to excel. Ronan in particular, though, manages to carry the well of Susie Salmon quite well and is one of the best performances in a while. Even Wahlberg, who, admit it, we're all getting tired of seeing nowadays, manages to do a good job. This may be one of the best performances from Wahlberg in forever. And Mr. Harvey's actor sure is excellent, and manages to pull off the psycho role well.

In short, this movie was not bad and I enjoyed it, but be warned- don't look for the amazing level of entertainment Kong or LOTR gave us. It was worth watching, at least once, despite the rather convoluted way of telling the story.

IN TOTAL:
Entertainment: 6/10- gorgeous eye candy, shame about the plot
Sex: 0/10
Violence: 2/10
CG: Overload/10
Acting: Pretty decent/10
Saoirse Ronan: Is a great actress and I see lots of potential in her
Wahlberg: Think you've been in enough movies, mate?
Jackson: Clearly loves the novel
What does the title mean? Wait until the last 10 minutes

3769631,4,B001QOGYAO,"The Lovely Bones combines very good acting, suspense, drama and even thriller elements to make a good movie about a young girl who dies--and then has quite a few experiences--after she passes away! The animation was rather well done and the choreography works very well; the cinematography is particularly good as well. The script was also quite good; but I would say that the plot moves along a bit too slow; they could have edited this down by ten or fifteen minutes to make the plot tighter.

When the action starts, we quickly meet 14 year old Susie Salmon, (Saoirse Ronan), who lives with her parents Abigail and Jack (Rachel Weisz and Mark Wahlberg) and her siblings in a small Pennsylvania town in the early 70s. Susie is a happy child; and she has quite a crush on a young guy at her high school, Ray (Reece Ritchie).

However, things don't go well for Susie and her family. Unbeknownst to them there's a neighbor, George Harvey (brilliantly portrayed by Stanley Tucci) who is quite insane; he loves to lure both young girls and teenage girls into situations in which he can kill them and get away with the crime. Unfortunately, George concocts an elaborate plan to murder Susie and he succeeds.

Of course, we are left waiting to discover how--or even if--George will ever be discovered to be Susie's killer and then brought to justice. Moreover, we see the devastating effects Susie's murder has on the remaining members of her family. In addition, there's an excellent fantasy theme running through the film; we see Susie existing in a beautiful world all her own which isn't quite the real world anymore but not quite all the way into heaven, either. Susie wants desperately to use her mind to send signals to her dad and others to guide them to discover that George is guilty and that he must be brought to justice. However, this may or may nor happen.

In addition, there are other events that go on in this film that I won't give away here. I don't want to spoil it for you! I will say that you can look for an excellent performance by Susan Sarandon as ""Grandma Lynn,"" Abigail Salmon's mother; and Nikki SooHoo was perfectly cast as Holly.

Hopefully when this comes out on DVD there will be a ""making of"" featurette and a commentary with director Peter Jackson.

The Lovely Bones may not have been the most thoughtful, intellectual movie of the year; but I found it to be genuinely entertaining and that's very good.

3769632,4,B001QOGYAO,"This is such a wonderful movie that touched my heart while watching it. It was a skillful mixture of drama, suspense, love, and ghost story.  It is a story of a trusting 14-year old girl, Suzie, who was murdered and knows her murderer. Her murderer dismembered her body parts and hid it in a safe, then later threw in a sinkhole.  At some point the spirit of this murdered girl was trapped in some sort of ""in between"" worlds where other souls gather together in one world that seems perfect, and the human world where her family has been grieving for a long time and her parents are having difficulty in moving on.  At first she did not know that she has been dead, eventually, she realized that she was now just a spirit wandering and desperate to communicate with her family regarding her murderer. Mark Wahlberg is a versatile actor who played the role of a father and whose immeasurable love was displayed through his true connection with his daughter. He tried his best to solve the murder of his child and ultimately succeeded with the help of his other daughter. Justice was served in a different manner.  Rachel Weisz played just all right as the mother, however, I felt her emotions were not her best.  Susan Sarandon is an alcoholic odd woman, yet funny who portrays the role of a grandma and who tried to pull things together when everyone was falling apart after her grand daughter's death.
This movie has wonderful cinematography, colorful graphics and animations, and special effects. This is a movie for all ages, and even though the focus of this movie is not on life after death, or death and dying, some would really wonder what is life after death, and appreciates that there really is heaven.

3769633,3,B001QOGYAO,"Overall Grade:  C+/B-

I knew nothing about this movie prior to seeing it, nor the book upon which it is based. My thoughts, overall a nice movie but did not blow me away, felt very contrived, and too long (it is 135mn, could have accomplished what it needed to in 90) to the point where I lost interest and wanted to stop watching.

Rachel Weisz is by far underutilised (she's an academy level actress but has a small supporting role in this film). Mark Walhberg utterly unconvincing as a grieving father (generally I am not a fan of his, to be honest, but this was pretty bad acting from him). Susan Sarandon small role but excellent as boozing grandmother. Above all, Stanley Tucci as the creepy killer gives the breakout performance of the movie.

Thought that the movie copies a lot from What Dreams May Come (which is a movie I love) but seems to overstate and exaggerate the dream (afterlife) sequences in an ""in your face"" kind of way whereas WDMC had more of a fantasy feel to it. (With an all-white cast, they even copy that the ""guide"" in heaven is a non-white person, just like Cuba Gooding, except in this film it's an Asian girl). The sweet lullaby narration of the main character accompanied by the George Winston-esque piano got to be *highly* annoying halfway thru.... made it difficult to watch.
