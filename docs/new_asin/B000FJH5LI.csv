8123590,3,B000FJH5LI,"A young man, feeling no connection to the life around him, meets his dream girl, and gets something worth fighting for. That in itself would be a charming premise. But in this story, its nowhere near that simple.
The girl, Hikari, is from outer space, and appears about the same time as another girl, neither of which with any clue who or what they actually are. This results in strange transformations; deadly battles with strange creatures; and the appearance on the scene of a very strange scientist, with no doubt questionable motives.
 This story is complex, but it does have its moments of charm. For me though, the many questions that remain unanswered left me feeling uneasy. The end result was that I never really developed an attachment to the two girls who are the focus of the story, mainly due to the ever present sense that there is something not quite right here. Of course, that was probably the point. It just left me less than enthused.
In the end, what we have here is the beginning of a rather different sort of anime storyline. There is danger, there is magic, and there is menace. There may even be hope, but I'll leave that for you to decide.",1224460800,,1165,4.574162679425838
8123591,5,B000FJH5LI,"This anime is awesome.  The storyline is kind of hard to understand at first, until the next volume.  But this show caught me off guard with a bunch of quick hilarious remarks.  Definitely recommended for anyone.  Rated MA of course. =)",1177113600,,236,4.682926829268292
8123592,5,B000FJH5LI,"First of all, I gotta say: this anime comes from the group behind both Evangelion and FLCL. I'ma big fan of FLCL's style, but I never liked Evnagelion. So much wasted potential and two - not even just one! - mediocre endings.

I mention this only so you know what a leap of faith it was when I bought this DVD based only on what I read on the backs of the first and third volumes. I felt I could relate to the main character, Takero, so I ran with it.

I don't think I've ever enjoyed an anime more than I did these first episodes. Despite the presence of the classic ""boy morphs to fight monsters"" anime staple, this is not your kid brother's anime. In the first volume, alone, it immediately shapes into an excellent showcase of human - and not-so-human - emotion.

The anime can be said to have two flaws, though I only count one. First, and this is the one I count: the second episode. Too much happens too fast, the episode struck me as ... forced. Second: the American scientist. I'm a little disappointed in how ... not scientific she comes across, for the most part. She is clearly some wacky stereotypical view of American women, however, and I find that crazy amusing, so I let her slide.

Oh, I don't usually watch my anime with subtitles. I watched the English dubs. For those who care, the English voice acting ain't bad, at all.",1174176000,,1342,4.356
8123593,5,B000FJH5LI,"I am not to big of an Anime guy. I am very picky when it comes to Anime and I cannot stand 99% of the crap out there. I only like three Animes so far that I have found. I got into Yu Yu Hakusho and I am a huge fan of the Guyver, if you like sci-fi/fighting then I say check out the Guyver, but pre-order the new one Vol 1. It is from the TV series that aired in Japan and it just beats the other guyver stuff out there but enough about the guyver

Enough about that shall we get back on track. Anyways I picked this anime up without really ever seeing any episodes. I was just read on a forum that someone thought it was good so I thought I'd go to best buy and see if it was there and sure enough it was. I was a little nervous about getting it cause I bought volume 1 and 2 without ever knowing if I would like em. Right now I will just talk about Vol:1 since this is about Vol:1.

This first episdes is just amazing, it really got me hooked onto the series. I am more of an action/fighting type of a guy when it comes to anime, movies and games but the story line is I think what got me hooked. Volume 1 will fly by real fast cause there is only 4 episodes. You may think you might not want to get Vol:2 cause maybe it's sorta slow well just wait. I really think if you thought vol 1 was eh then check out vol 2 and then if you still don't like it, then sell them.

All I am going to say is when I got finished with Vol 2 i was like omg, now i have to wait until vol 3 comes out NO NO NO!!!! Amazon says this is for people 16+ but its really rated MA on the back of the dvd. Cause there is a lot of adult content on here like nudity, a lot of nudity. So make sure you don't have your little brother, sister, or other family members around while you watch this

Overall 5/5",1160524800,4,1775,3.763440860215054
8123594,5,B000FJH5LI,"i have already viewed this anime in its entirety, and all i can say is that it is quite unique and definetly worth looking into. don't worry, yes it does have alot of fanservice, but it does deliver an interesting story a little later into the series. it is definitely unique. plus the opening theme is so strange that its awesome. just one more thing, if you think that it is just a fanservice fest, you should see ""he is my master"", which was also done by gainax",1155340800,4,464,4.284090909090909
8123595,3,B000FJH5LI,"Volume one of This Ugly Yet Beautiful World wasn't a bad. It's just the expectations that it set for itself were way too high. Firstly, it's presented as GAINAX's 20th anniversary anime. GAINAX is the same company responsible for FLCL and Neon Genesis Evangelion. Honestly, I don't think that This Ugly Yet Beautiful World even comes close to what those two anime are or have achieved, and putting those names on the back of the DVD case really damages the integrity of this anime. It just isn't that good to be presented as a showpiece.

Another problem I found was the fact that the story moves way too slow. At twelve episodes, you'd expect things to really get down and dirty early. While the first episode was exciting, which I'll talk about later, it goes from there to introducing a slow stream of characters. By the fourth episodes, all we really know about the overall story is that two girls have come from space to freeload off a couple of good-hearted high school guys who are surrounded by a bunch of oversexualized friends.

In essence, this volume of This Ugly Yet Beautiful World was a fan-service extravaganza, aimed solely at pure exploitation. There is a scene where one of the characters, Jennifer Portman, invites one of the alien girls, Hikari, to take a shower with her. This, I'm sorry to say to everyone who actually enjoys useless animated nudity, is pointless and made nearly no sense.

If it wasn't for the exciting first episode, where Takeru first meets Hikari and has to defend her against a giant insect-like snake, I would have completely written this series off. But that episode promised a lot for the future of this anime, and though that promise doesn't come through in the following three episodes, I'm hoping that it will in the next volume. Another thing that made this volume a little more tolerable was the animation; yes, it was cutesy, but it was also fluid and highly detailed. So if you can stand a slow moving story and enjoy cutesy animation and some brief, if intense action, with a lot of promise, then I recommend This Ugly Yet Beautiful world to you. Otherwise, this is an anime that can probably be passed up.",1152316800,24,2162,4.684210526315789
8123596,5,B000FJH5LI,It is sad to see that girls from earth don't like Takeru cause he's kid of lazy and just an average joe. Earthly girls are so sincere and childish. That's why girls from outer space have more class and will love a man for who he is and not what they wish he would be just ask Hikari who's a real woman. The only thing that's getting in Takeru's and Hikari's relationship way is evil bad aliens that must of followed her.,1149552000,6,420,4.134146341463414
