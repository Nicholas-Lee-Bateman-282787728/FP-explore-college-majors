2665655,5,B000J10F7I,"Wow, I have not seen this one for more than ten years ago. Time sure flies. When I see this product in stores, I was a bit hesitating because I have seen the trailer in english dubbed and music changed. Once I have heard from friends who rented or owned it, they said the japanese versions were kept in tact. You know, they were right!. That made me happy. I tried to give english version a chance, but I cannot surpass the music, the new given names, and the new special effects during the race. It just not the same! Just to be fair, I will only review only the original japanese version. The picture and the sound are really clean for a first season TV series. The contents are kept intact. I do not recall any scenes have been edited out. I recommend who enjoys classic sport cars do battle and remind how good the cars in their time.",1202601600,5,838,4.24375
2665656,5,B000J10F7I,"Now that Funimation has the rights to Initial D its even better!  The DVDs contain  both the original Japanese production (for the fans) and the English TokyoPop version (for those who don't want to read).  Ive been a fan of the series for years now, and for those that are new to Initial D, I highly recommend picking this collection up.  Plus its much cheaper that buying each single DVD, which would cost around $150.

I just hope Funimation continues to release all of the stages in collections like this...",1173744000,10,511,4.633333333333334

2665751,5,B000J10F7I,"This really is the best racing anime you'll find. The effects are just corny enough to be entertaining to watch, and the plot's just as great as the racing scenes.",1313280000,,163,4.466666666666667
2665752,5,B000J10F7I,"Hey, I bought all of the new Initial D dvds from Funimation including the original ones from Tokyopop. The original Tokyopop dub only went to the end of the 2nd Stage and with these new Funimation dubs, you get to see the whole show from 1st Stage to 4th Stage if you buy them all. The aspect ratio is 4:3 and you have your choice of English or Japanese language. The Tokyopop dub is not on here. Just the new Funimation one. But you do get to hear the original Euro Beat music and the original sound effects of the cars. The video is also not tampered with and you see the original Japanese openings and endings. The dubbing sounds pretty similar to the Tokyopop one if you've already seen it. Obviously they're not the same actors but it's not bad. Starting off, this anime is kind of old. It's from the 90's and CG wasn't the best back then and animation was experimenting. But it does get better over time.
  The plot is about a high schooler in Japan who gets thrown into racing against street racers, who race up and down mountain passes illegally. The show follows this boy as he beats the various high end racers in his old car versus their new cars. One of the main plot points is whether skill and knowledge beat the make of a car. The show starts off a little slow but once the racing starts, it gets quite addictive.
  The show itself is pretty well done. The only things I would have to say that bother me are the actual dvds themselves. The aspect ratios aren't consistent between the stages. Of course I know the later ones are supposed to be 16:9, but they are in a 4:3 screen which makes the video surrounded by black. I also noticed a minor dubbing error or something but at the end of episode 23. Itsuki and Takumi are sitting next to the 86 and there's a lot of silence. Nothing wrong with that per say, but they then continue a conversation as if someone said something right there. I've noticed this on other Funimation dvds like Tsubasa Chronicle volume 12 where Fai is talking and no voice. So besides some minor mess ups with rendering or something, it's all good.
  This is a great series and if you're a fan of racing or of the underdog rising up through the ranks, you should check this out. Perhaps if a dvd release of the stages together comes out, they may fix those rendering problems. But they really are minor and shouldn't affect your viewing pleasure. Hope this review helps and if you have any comments or questions, let me know.",1305676800,4,2466,4.373362445414847
2665753,5,B000J10F7I,"All the disks arrived in perfect condition, brand new just as stated. I love this show and i was very happy to find it at this price. I don't know what else to say, it came in the saran wrap, sealed, with all the stuff. It made me happy",1288828800,,236,3.836734693877551
2665754,5,B000J10F7I,COMPLETE First Stage of the great Anime! Cant get any better! Perfect for any JDM-car enthusiast!,1281398400,,97,5.125
2665755,5,B000J10F7I,I grew up watching Initial D and it is completely awesome. The characters are engaging and every episode will drop some useful knowledge about automobiles and racing technique. I highly recommend the Tricked Out version with hip hop and pop electronic soundtrack and some CGI animations. The original version is very nice as well and you can watch it with English sub-titles if you do not understand Japanese.,1259971200,,409,5.029411764705882
2665756,5,B000J10F7I,"Let me start the review with the package. This box set is very well presented and includes a booklet with the characters and their respective cars, also this package includes a sticker with the FUJIWARA TOFU logo as a bonus.

This first season (of four) tells the story of TAKUMI FUJIWARA a dreamy high-school student and its introduction to STREET RACING. Takumi's friends don't know that he has drive the dangerous and complicated Mt. Akina for the last 5 years, delivering TOFU (the family business) for customers. One interesting thing is that he doesn't only drive in a legendary car .... his father secretly trains him to control the car like any other part of his body.

Some events lead Takumi to compete with a well know STREET RACING TEAM, called the RED SUNS and this is the beginning of a new world for Takumi. Something awoke inside him when he felt the rush to compete with a much higher powered car with a good driver inside.

Drama, love, comedy and too much action awaits you in this series that comes in 9 DVD and will give you many hours of fun. You will love the series for sure, even if the animation is a little bit different combining 3D CG with hand drawn animation.

You will be immediately drawn to INITIAL D universe in the end of the first DVD. Enjoy",1251504000,2,1278,4.495689655172414
