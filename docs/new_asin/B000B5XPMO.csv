8081748,3,B000B5XPMO,"This dvd isn't a 1-star or 5-star video.  It's average.  I think an average video camera was used to film the video, so it doesn't seem the most professional.  But it does have some good information and presents different topics in 5 minutes.",1372982400,,242,4.5813953488372094
8081749,1,B000B5XPMO,if you do not know anything this will not help. if you do know somrthing this is useless,1197331200,,88,3.9444444444444446
8081750,5,B000B5XPMO,"I was a little skeptical at first...especailly being a woman with NO plumbing experience at all!  I was amazed at how easy it was!  The dvd walks you through everything step by step.  Unless you are a complete idiot, this video is very helpful!",1151107200,,244,4.5
8081751,1,B000B5XPMO,Wow! Where did they get this garbage! The video is poor and audio the drifts off. As far as being instructional I suggest you buy a book. Waste of time!,1145923200,,152,4.1
