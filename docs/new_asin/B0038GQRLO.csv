4084558,5,B0038GQRLO,"Norman Finkelstein is an outstanding scholar. His failure to obtain tenure indicates that something is gravely wrong with American academia.
The documentary itself is fascinating and informative. My only complaint is that the DVD does not include an audio commentary.",1274313600,13,267,5.7
4084559,5,B0038GQRLO,"A riveting and engaging film portraying a tireless and amazing man fighting for freedom of speech and a just peace in Palestine/ Israel. Mr. Finkelstein's scholarship, passion, humility and humanity are unmatched and they come through so clearly in this film. He's an unsung hero of this country and I thank the filmmakers for bringing attention to him. Although the film does not go in depth into his scholarship and the issues for which the Zionist lobby, organized or individuals, have gone after him for, I still think the film succeeds in bringing to the surface the problems with academic censorship and Zionist control over the discourse in this country.",1271808000,34,661,5.0181818181818185
4084560,5,B0038GQRLO,"I recently got a chance to watch the documentary ""American Radical: The Trials of Norman Finkelstein"" and I'd have to say that this is such a poignant documentary that was put together remarkably well. It maintained an impartial and balanced objective as it managed to allot equal air time to both those who are on Finkelsteins side and those who believe that he is completely wrong.
How rare is that in documentaries?

Its very brave to be so bold and stand up for what you believe in, even when it costs you dearly...
That is completely respectable in my book, definitely turned me into a fan of this man.",1271376000,69,607,4.568807339449541
4084561,5,B0038GQRLO,"I really liked it. The current state of the media got to a point where the claim of ""fair and balanced"" can not be true. The bias in the mainstream media gets to its worse degree when it comes to the Israel-Palestine issue. This documentary might be considered biased in its own way, however, it's far more balanced than your typical ""mainstream"" media. The dedication Dr. Nnorman Finkelstein shows in this documentary is a good lesson to whoever wants to work in this field (raising awareness among Americans).",1271376000,28,511,4.818181818181818
4084562,5,B0038GQRLO,"Having listened to Norman Finkelstein speak at King's College last year, I was very much looking forward to seeing this film, and I was not disappointed. Leaving aside the politics, this film takes a deeply personal look at Finkelstein's life and analyses the roots of his beliefs regarding the Israel-Palestine question, exploring his mother's influence, her experiences in Auschwitz, and consequently, her inherent, all-pervading sense of justice.

Essential viewing for an objective view of the conflict, and it sends a strong, inspiring message for anyone wishing to uncover the truth. It certainly doesn't shy away from controversy, but the subject matter is handled with respect, as it includes commentary from both Finkelstein's advocates and opponents, including Alan Dershowitz (author of The Case for Israel). Simply a must for anyone who's ever needed inspiration to stand up for what they believe in.",1271376000,44,912,5.468085106382978
4084563,5,B0038GQRLO,"American Radical: Trials of Norman Finkelstein beautifully illustrates the conviction that Dr. Norman Finkelstein has for his beliefs and the great hardships, emotionally as well as environmental, he has faced to be honest to himself and speak the truth as he sees it. As a son of Holocaust survivors, Dr. Finkelstein has especially come under harsh criticism by many in the Jewish community. Not ashamed of his Jewish background, tough vocal critics try to assign the title of self-hating to Dr. Finkelstein, his career is a testiment to doing the right thing in the face of hypocrisy. An activist against violent agression, Dr. Finkelstein is not only inspiring for academics, but can be understood by the novice learning about differing opinions. This movie does an excellent job of balancing the private, public, academic and a bit tortured aspects of Dr. Finkelsteins live without compromising in a way that leaves Dr. Finkelstein appearing infalliable.",1271376000,17,958,5.26797385620915
4084564,5,B0038GQRLO,"This documentary excellently covers Finkelstein's life, private & public persona and the controversy surrounding his intellectual work. In it you'll find some of his finest achievement and public moments, along with a portrayal of what makes him up psychologically and (somewhat regrettably) the views of his detractors like Alan Dershowitz (shudder). This doc is a must-see for the Finkelstein fan and opponent alike.",1271289600,20,418,5.650793650793651
4084565,5,B0038GQRLO,What bravery it is to go against the grain. Norman has done that and paid the price.  Just like it was said that only Nixon could have gone to China then only someone like Norman can press for fairness in the Palestinian cause.  He is not hung up on being Jewish but rather the fact that so many have used religion to gain sympathy for their cause without sympathy for the victims.  I am proud to add this to my library collection of documentaries worth seeing.,1360108800,2,461,4.337209302325581
4084566,5,B0038GQRLO,Norman Finklestein is uncompromising and outspoken in his search for truth and justice.  This is definitely a must see documentary!,1357084800,2,131,5.55
4084567,5,B0038GQRLO,Professor Finkelstein is such a humble and beautiful person and this film just emphasizes on that. It captures the scenes behind Professor Norman's hectic life. It depicts the struggles he has gone through with the life his parents had as Holocaust survivors and the impact it had on him emotionally and mentally while growing up. You can clearly see that this man is standing up for justice and peace and AGAINST tyranny and oppression. It is amazing to see a man stand up for justice and human rights even though it is against his own people because He CLEARLY sees where the TRUTH lies and where FALSEHOOD lies. Which drives him to make a conscious decision to fight for the TRUTH.Professor Finkelstein was Influenced by the struggle and pain his parents faced during the Holocaust and for the remainder of their lives after the Holocaust. Love this man!!!,1356998400,,859,4.8108108108108105
4084568,5,B0038GQRLO,"For anyone who is interested in knowing more about the man, Norman Finkelstein, and the struggles he has immersed himself in for a just cause, this is the documentary. It comes as close as anything can to give a complete picture of Finkelstein's life, what he as a person is, the Israel-Palestine issue that he stands up for and his reasons for doing so, and the fearlessness with which he exposes the ""schmatta"" that pseudo-scholars like Derschowitz are. Not only will it allow you to see the other side of the picture and know what his opponents think of him, you will also get a very intimate account of his personal life and the way it has been affected because of his principles. Seeing a scholar like Finkelstein suffer because of his stance the way he does in a country that claims to be all for freedom of expression might even bring you to tears.",1355961600,4,855,4.52258064516129
4084569,5,B0038GQRLO,"This documentary follows Norman Finkelstein on various college speaking engagements after the success of his book The Holocaust Industry.
The documentary captures the highs and lows of his tour and the verbal assault on his name and character. All in all this is a great documentay and well worth a purchase.",1355961600,,308,5.0588235294117645
4084570,5,B0038GQRLO,"This documentary follows Norman Finkelstein as he begins a number of college speaking engagements. After the success of his book The Holocaust Industry, Dr Finkelstein finds himself becoming a target for his books criticisms on Israel and its right wing supporters, hence the title American Radical. This is an excellent documentary and it is worth purchasing.",1355961600,3,360,5.446428571428571
4084571,1,B0038GQRLO,"It is a known fact that Chomsky and Finkelstein are kept isolated by the academia, together with a number of other antisemitic Jews. The reason why this 'show' does not sell can easily be understood once you pay the cost - but then it is too late. I fell for this trick and soon I will ask Amazon to buy it back at any price.",1348531200,4,325,4.015384615384615
4084572,5,B0038GQRLO,"After watching this film I was moved to tears ( not crocodile tears either). Aside from Dr. Finkelstein's passion and drive, his demeanor and ability to laugh off an angry mob, I found his depth and humility staggering. Dr. Finkelstein's love for his parents and devotion to his mother's beliefs is something I, as a parent, hope to find in my own children. It seems as though he actually feels the pain and suffering his parents felt in the concentration camps. Whether you agree with Dr. Finkelstein's views or not, one must recognize and acknowledge what he has sacrificed to minimize or end the suffering of mankind. Dr. Finkelstein is genuine and sincere and has a heart of gold. Those who threaten, demean and retaliate against him should be ashamed of themselves. My hope is that you watch this film and acknowledge the depth of Dr. Finkelstein's soul.",1330041600,9,859,4.8108108108108105
4084573,5,B0038GQRLO,"Norman Finkelstein is a polarizing figure - in part because many people view any criticism of Israeli policies in the West Bank as an attack on Israel or Jews per se (Finkelstein as it happens is Jewish - the son of Holocaust survivors, but is still periodically smeared as an anti-Semite).

But also - he seems to sometimes use aggressive, even angry language, ostensibly feeling {not unreasonably} that while there is much room for debate as to Israel/Palestine, to a large extent, much of the public conversation amounts to 'defending the indefensible.'  In other words, whichever over-arching narrative one clings to, war crimes and violations of UN resolutions, when they happen, should not be subject to serious debate.  Yet Israel's commission of war crimes becomes politicized, accusations and suspicions abound, and the public debate becomes essentially Orwellian in tone and content.

With respect to people who are strongly pro-Israel, I do think they would find the film interesting, but they won't change their minds on Professor Finkelstein.  I consider myself a pro-peace moderate but largely agree with Finkelstein's assessment of Israeli war crimes in Gaza, Lebanon and the West Bank.  Parenthetically, I think the U.S. committed war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan, but just as one person's freedom fighter is another person's terrorist {cf. the King David Hotel and 1930s/40s Zionism} - sometimes our sense of identity and 'narrative' preclude an honest assessment of actions we would easily recognize as barbaric if 'the other side' did it.

I became interested in Finkelstein initially through some youtube videos, then read his book ""Beyond Chutzpah"" which, in my humble opinion, should be required reading for anyone interested in Israel/Palestine - with the caveat that it is not a ""neutral"" analysis, but a polemic, which marshals a great deal of evidence as to Israel's crimes against the Palestinian people.  Some reference is made to that book in the film - his battle with Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz {who is in my considered opinion an obvious plagiarist, and a pro-torture Jewish supremacist of sorts whose facile casuistry and shameless dissembling on Israel/Palestine should have led to his disbarment.}

It {the book} is not fair and balanced precisely because Finkelstein's view is that the narrative we tend to be given presents what is in essence a pro-Israeli, pro-Zionist view.  This does seem very largely true - American media simply does not give Israeli violence against Palestinians the same coverage it does and has of Palestinian acts of terror.  The fact that Israel has accelerated its colonial scheme in the occupied territories should make clear to even the most obtuse that it does not intend to end its occupation, and yet Americans presume Israel ""wants peace"" and can't get it because of those contemptible brown Arabs, who launch rockets at school children for no other reason than a primordial hatred of Jews.

I think it's very tough to respect the views of others on a topic we have a lot of emotional investment in - but I think this film is very valuable, and interesting because it shows a very polarizing figure as a human being in a way that, for example, ""Beyond Chutzpah"" might not.  The story of how the child of Holocaust Survivors came to a staunchly 'pro-Palestinian' view is fascinating in and of itself, and it may be that Finkelstein's strongest critics might come away with some fresh perspectives on both the man and the view he espouses to resolutely.",1330041600,8,3535,5.095155709342561
4084574,5,B0038GQRLO,"What a remarkable Being.

Resolve such as this unequivocally emanates from a very deep seated sense of Humanity.

He unwaveringly challenges with a banner of Morality and Ethics in one hand and Factual Truths in the other.

Such an Honorable individual, to stand against many of those within his own identity, knowing them to be Wrong.

This can only be true Righteousness.

Whether he is Jewish or not, appears to be far less relevant to him than are his guiding Moral Values and Ethical Principles.

His profound sense of Humanity was undoubtedly nurtured early in life by his mother and what she came away with, from her own persecution under the Nazis.

Simply put, he is a true Rebel.

Much has been written about the 'Humanity of the Rebel' thoughout history. Essentially, it is one who selflessly challenges Injustice, regardless.

What makes him a Radical however, is not his message, but rather that he does little to self-preserve. So tenaciously commited, is he, to the message, that he has forsaken better judgement when it comes to his own personal needs.

Unlike his mentor Chomsky who bucks the establishment from within, he does so from without, and hence, has found himself more ostracized, besieged, and assaulted. This has sadly brought him much personal sacrifice and pain, to say the least.

Otherwise as a Rebel, he clearly has no interest in personal empowerment, as evidenced by his plight. He continually and steadfastly reiterates the Truthful Facts as they stand, allowing them to speak for themselves.

He is such an extremely well-informed scholar that it has been virtually impossible for anyone to take him on based on the facts, whether in writing or in debate. He consistently attempts to remain intellectually focused and composed, not allowing anyone to derail him, nor deflect and escape his steel-trap mind.

To his credit, he has been unwavering in his onslaught against Injustice, inspite of the many risks, hardships and obstacles before him.

One can only hope, that in time, he will become more enlightened with regard to the need to effect change from within, however, even if so, it is likely too late, as he has found himself indeed a self-made pariah. Otherwise, he should continue in his noble pursuit of challenging Injustice, and hopefully without any additional peril to himself.

Unfortunately, for this Rebel, as with others in history, their goal is never fully accomplished, for Injustice will forever be part of the Human Experience.

As with all genuine rebels, he will be hailed and remembered long after he has gone.",1322784000,,2574,5.007042253521127
4084575,5,B0038GQRLO,Prof. Norman Finkelstien is highly committed to his principles. His one and only motivation is to reach peace in practice and to allow justice to manifest. He gives me hope.,1317945600,4,173,4.8
4084576,5,B0038GQRLO,"I was looking forward to watching this documentary as I have listened to many of Dr. Finkelstein's lectures and debates.  This documentary gave a much deeper understanding into the how his life has affected his morals and principles for which he has sacrificed so much for.

There was one thing that I did not like about the documentary (does not merit a star deduction) which was their coverage of the debate between Finkelstein and Dershowitz.  I think they did Dr. Finkelstein a disfavor by highlighting one point he had to make (arguably a weaker one) without the other glaring errors and proofs of plagiarism he brought forth in the same debate.  This was a very pivotal moment in his career as it affected his tenureship bids, etc. yet they didn't show the majority of the very strong arguments he made.

Overall, I think this documentary gave me a better glance for what this man stands for, why he stands for it, and the human elements behind his drive and consequences for his actions.",1315440000,7,994,4.722543352601156
4084577,5,B0038GQRLO,"Finkelstein is my kind of hero. A man who has a moral compass and is not afraid of the consequences of telling the truth to authority. After watching this documentary you will have a clear idea of who Finkelstein the man is, unless you are an unconditional supporter of Israel you will respect the man.
Highly recommended.",1308441600,9,322,4.666666666666667

4084579,5,B0038GQRLO,"Heartening is the only word that comes fairly close to describe how I feel. Dr. Finkelstein knows that exposing the truth is overwhelming as he's experienced first hand, but his moral compass would simply not allow him to be silent about the corruption and exploitation. I hope I'm alive to see the day everyone sides with him and factual reality. Wars and destruction would not come about if more leaders and politicians had the same mentality and ethical responsibilities as this brilliant man.

This DVD follows the lifework of a man devoted to bringing justice and peace to the Palestinians . . . as well as exposing the actions taken by the Israelis, that impede an agreement to be reached between the two.

4084582,5,B0038GQRLO,"Firstly, anyone who is going to watch this documentary in order to further advance their knowledge of the Israel-Palestine condlict and the Arab-Israel conflict is watching the wrong documentary. This documentary is about the man Noram Finkelstein not the crisis. It gives an interesting non-partisan assesment of who Noram G. Finkelstein is and what makes him ticks.

It gives equal time to critics, fans, freinds, rivals and neutral associates of Norman.
The documentary shows the life of a man who is forced to the edge of the intellectual, sholary, Israeli and foreign policy debate due to his views and his stern criticism.

However those Noram fans who think this documentary is going to show him in a godly manner are mistaken. This documentary attempts to be as critical of Norman as it praises him. I would recomend it to everyone who is interested in Noramns life work and har read his books.

I'm giving it a 5/5 not becuase of the fact that it is a documentary about a man that intriuges me and a man who I often agree with, but I am giving it a 5/5 becuase it truly attempts to be as non-partisan as possible being imbedded with Norman.",1305244800,5,1149,4.678217821782178
4084583,5,B0038GQRLO,"This documentary on Norman Finkelstein only reinforces my impression of his being a man with unqualified humanity who simply cannot tolerate social injustice.  The cameras follow him around the world as he gives speeches/participates in debates on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, mostly on college campuses, and it interviews his supporters as well as his detractors--those propagandists and apologists for Israeli occupation whose presence and voices in the mainstream media are pervasive.  They have called him a self-hating Jew, Holocaust denier and anti-Semite, slandering him all over the Internet, etc. (just as they've done to Noam Chomsky, Justice Richard Goldstone, and any other bearer of the news that Israel has committed war crimes in its 43-year occupation and in its asasult on Gaza).  And this despite the fact that he has NEVER denied the Holcaust and this despite both his parents being survivors of it--which obviously affected him acutely.  It is not ""self-hating"" or ""self-loathing"" to call out one's own ethno-religious group (although Finkelstein is secular) on their continued and longstanding denial of another people's human rights.  It is not ""progressive"" to try to prevent a man whose political opinions differ from your own to lose his tenure bid at the university at which he teaches.  It is not ""progressive"" to institute a massive letter-writing campaign demanding that a book, the findings of which you do not agree with and do not like, not be allowed publication (Finkelstein's ""Beyond Chutzpah"") because it exposes your own book (Dershowitz's ""The Case for Israel"") for the pseudo-scholarship that it is.  So much for Dershowitz's defense of the civil liberties of Americans.  I recommend this documentary to anyone who truly cares about justice in Palestine/Israel and who wants to hear the voice of a man who has been advocating for that his entire career, despite much personal cost.  Finkelstein is incredibly passionate, brilliant, a meticulous scholar, witty, quirky/eccentric, and a true progressive, unlike so many liberals who call themselves progressive but practice a selective humanity when it comes to the Palestinians.  I think two of the scenes that struck me the most were when his long-time Palestinian friend in the West Bank whom he was staying with expressed surprise (and perhaps slight embarrassment) to see Finkelstein cry after the Israeli army killed a Palestinian boy; and then in another scene, when talking about his parents being in extermination camps, he looked like he was about to cry, or wanted to cry, but didn't.  This is the portrait of a good man who, despite all the self-serving lies told about him by those who would like to shut him up and prevent his speaking the facts about this conflict, won't be quiet about an injustice that he obviously takes very personally.",1293840000,13,2847,5.248898678414097
4084584,5,B0038GQRLO,"Alas, this documentary clocks in at 90 minutes but one wishes we could get a lengthier portrait of the complicated individual at its heart. Finkelstein in his trademark measured tone truly fits his own definition of a radical: someone who sees the world as radically unfair and who sees radical personal efforts as needed to rectify those injustices. While he goes through personal tribulations caused by his unwavering beliefs, he seems to carry the day in arguments and debates that rage the world over as he takes on a panoply of opponents. The audience is left with respect for Finkelstein and a desire that he end up victorious, much as we doubt that will ever be possible given the power and ruthlessness of his enemies.

This documentary does not end on a hopeful note but it is inspirational nonetheless. It could have gone the easy way out but instead simply conveys stark truths and asks us to make our individual decisions regarding our own moral choices in life.",1292630400,5,974,4.7976190476190474
4084585,5,B0038GQRLO,"I have long relied on Norman Finkelstein as a main source for Middle East commentary.  This film is an accurate depiction of the Finkelstein that emerges from his books.  Not an easy task as they are two different mediums, and a film cannot capture the depth of analysis that a book contains.  I have to disagree with Noam Chomsky on one point he raises in the film about the Finkelstein-Dershowitz matter concerning Dershowitz's book.  Chomsky states that in his opinion he thought it a mistake by Finkelstein to concentrate on Dershowitz's book as an act of plagiarism of Joan Peter's book.  Rather Chomsky suggests it would be better to concentrate on exposing the errors of `facts' in Dershowitz's book.  However I think Finkelstein was correct in exposing not only the errors of `facts' but also the plagiarism.  Dershowitz claims that his book is making a `case' (legal exercise) for Israel.  However if the person making the case is not reliable on their sources or even on what is original work, then the case is dismissed on those grounds.  In a shell game at the carnival, there is no debate about whether it is an actual pea under the shell.  The carnival game or `case' is an entertainment to begin with, and not to be seriously considered.",1288742400,7,1252,4.75462962962963
4084586,5,B0038GQRLO,"What this film is not: It is not an introduction to the Middle East conflict. For that, you'll have to pick up a book or two. What this film is: This is a very touching film about one of the most passionate and tragic figures in academia. A well respected scholar on the Middle East conflict, the political scientist Norman Finkelstein is loved by his students and many of his colleagues but has garnered enmity due to his vocal voice crusading for the rights of the Palestinians. His enemies, many of whom are not scholars on the conflict and not worthy to sharpen his pencils, have mounted successful attacks to discredit him in the general media and in the public's eyes. That's unfortunate as many of his views are mainstream and not that controversial. He is for the Two State Solution and is for the consensus views on a variety of human rights and international legal issues. What grates his opponents so much is his acerbic tone, his unrelenting efforts, and his willingness to sacrifice even his own welfare (including his means to make a living) to live by the high moral standards he has set for himself. His enemies, such as the Harvard law professor, Alan Dershiwitz, are wealthy, powerful and very influential, and using that influence, have gotten him fired from his own academic institution (despite his stellar publication and teaching record). Finkelstein has been banned from Israel due to his critical stance towards the country, a country that gives Jews a Right of Return based on the rationale that Jews everywhere should always have a safe haven to go which they can call home despite the fact that both Finkelstein's parents are Holocaust survivors.

We see much of the history of the making of such a character. How the experiences of his parents in the concentration camps has solidified a kind of integrity and strength that refuses to compromise core principles in the face of evil. We see the price one sometimes must pay to live a just life in an unjust world. This is an unforgettable biographical portrait of a great scholar and activist.",1288656000,5,2071,4.784916201117318
4084587,5,B0038GQRLO,"I am an unashamed Finkelstein fan, and I loved every minute of this documentary.

The doco does not focus on arguing the case for or against Finkelstein's own political analysis but rather focuses instead on the man. We see Dr Finkelstein with friends, we see him in conflict with his academic opponents, and we see him alone, reflecting on his own life and work, and the man we meet in each context is impressive.

While in no way idealising Dr Finkestein or hiding his rough edges, Nick Rossier shows us a man who is passionate, committed, articulate, and extraordinarily humble. Indeed, it was the humility of the great man that most impacted me in this presentation and (dare I say) it was something I had not expected.

'American Radical' is not the best starting point for someone who is wanting to do research into the Israel/Palestine crisis, but neither does it pretend to be.  It is a portrayal of a man who has given his life to the cause of justice and peace, and it is an excellent portrayal.",1288656000,5,1005,4.597765363128492
4084588,5,B0038GQRLO,"Norm doesn't want to be put on a pedestal - because he lacks the ego that most adulated academics and politicians have.  This movie shows us what it is like to come out and speak about atrocities committed by a gang that has a very strong political backing and an almost airtight manipulative defense system. I watched Norm's detractors act like a bunch of (  albeit varnished articulate educated and IMMENSELY powerful) thugs. I didn't hear any factual arguments from these big name detractors against Norm- just emotionalism gang groupthink. Because they don't like it that Norm, a child of holocaust survivors- is a jewish jew hater ( their words) and a protector of the Arab side in the conflict- they make sure that he gets punished and big time. It's not enough to make sure he gets denied tenure and is broke and out of a job because he has offended some big names, but they want to see him evicted from his home in America, and he is forbidden entry into Israel. The film was eye opening for me - even in the highest echelons I see that these hyper acclaimed academics are no better than the Chicago mobs of the 30's- there is no room for dissent- Like another famous thug says- you're either with us or against us. I like Norm , he fights for who he believes is wronged even though it has cost him a great deal. I haven't read his works but may do so now as a result- and I will give him wide berth because I believe that he is uncorrupted and driven because he abhors injustice.",1288396800,8,1488,4.38768115942029

4084590,4,B0038GQRLO,"Prof. Finkelstein. Is he a saint or the devil? Neither, but I do think he is honest.

His parents were Holocaust survivors and his mother's life centered around her experiences during her captivity. It affected her profoundly and Prof. Finkelstein has taken her lessons to heart. When he sees injustice being done by the Israeli government, he is bewildered and upset by it.

However, he seems to be looking at the problem from one side only. When you ONLY look at one side of this conflict, it is very easy to take heart with that side.

Some (e.g. Alan Dershowitz) see him as a Jew-hater. I believe this opinion is as shallow as it is ridiculous. Jews everywhere have ostracized him, so it is understandable to me how Finkelstein has lost his affinity for the Jewish faith and taking issue with Israeli policies does not make one a Jew-hater.

Some problems I have with Finkelstein:

In the film, he says that his parents had no problems with his outspoken views, but at another point, he admits that his mother thought she had created another FRANKENSTEIN.

Though I think Prof. Finkelstein is indeed a creation of his parents upbringing, he (unfortunately) likes to look at issues (e.g. the Israel/Palestine conflict) from only one side.  NOTE:  This is not a unique quality!  Most people like to look at only one side of a problem and then come to a conclusion.  The only thing that makes Finkelstein unique, is that he is a Jew who doesn't latch on to the Jewish/Israeli narrative.  This doesn't make his viewpoint more valid.

This film won't tell you everything about Finkelstein's opinions, but it will give you a good look into this troubled man's soul.",1288224000,4,1663,4.736111111111111
4084591,5,B0038GQRLO,"Few characters in any documentary will display the kind of iron moral convictions and warrior spirit of Norman Finkelstein. ""American Radical"" is the portrait of a scholar taking on a world of lies, comformity and propaganda using the truth as his sword and finding himself viciously attacked by the gatekeepers of popular myth. Finkelstein's specialty is the issue of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories, using nothing but the facts he condemns Israel as a brutal regime that needs to stop what it's doing or suffer the consequences. But as Finkelstein himself states in the film, the truth is often a bitter pill to swallow.

""American Radical"" follows Finkelstein during his lecture tours and into his personal life. The portrait we get is of a man who's parents survived the Holocaust and who's mother raised him with a real hatred for injustice and compassion for human life. Finkelstein regularly cites his mother's convictions as having deeply influenced his own, and we see him confront pro-Israel hawks with fiery rhetoric which is never sensationalist. His words burn because they feel so honest and he uses facts like bullets, it is interesting to see pro-Israel fanatics like Alan Dershowitz dismiss Finkelstein as ""sick"" while they themselves virtually embody the word. Dershowitz especially hates Finkelstein because Finkelstein exposed the frauds and questionable sources for one of his books.

Some of the most intriguing moments in the documentary involve Palestinians in the West Bank describing their time with Finkelstein when he stayed in the occupied territories during the Intifada of the 1980s. In a moving scene a Palestinian man describes how Finkelstein broke down everytime he recounted witnessing the shooting of a Palestinian boy by Israeli soldiers. We get the sense that Finkelstein is the true definition of an internationalist, this is not a man who has the time for pathetic nationalist loyalties. In the film he travels to Lebanon and admits admiration for Hezbollah, not because of their political program, but because people have the right to resist the foreign invasion of their country.

""American Radical"" is not a probing look at Finkelstein's books, it is a study of the man. We see him at home and at the airport, discussing his convictions and attitudes. This is a surprisingly balanced documentary in the sense that it also allows his detractors to speak, it doesn't even attempt to paint them in a negative light because they do that themselves by slamming Finkelstein with offensive slurs while Finkelstein only responds with facts and truth. ""American Radical"" is a great introduction to Finkelstein the man for those unfamiliar with him, but hopefully it will inspire many to check out his actual work which ranks up there with the likes of Noam Chomsky and Chris Hedges. A fascinating, memorable portrait.",1278979200,8,2870,5.19438444924406
4084592,5,B0038GQRLO,"I recently saw ""American Radical:  The Trials of Norman Finkelstein,"" and I was bowled over by the immense power of this brilliant documentary.  Rarely does one see a film that is so hard-hitting and unafraid to speak the truth - a true testament to Norman Finkelstein, who has dedicated his life to telling the truth as he sees it and in speaking truth to power.  ""American Radical"" reminds us of Polonius's advice to his son Laertes, ""This above all: to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man.""  A difficult path to follow in these morally compromised times - but when were the times not morally compromised?  With ""American Radical,"" filmmakers David Ridgen and Nicolas Rossier have provided us with a superb creation - a wonderful gift - which should be seen by all of us who need reassurance that ""doing the right thing"" is the right thing to do.",1276819200,10,918,4.539393939393939
4084593,4,B0038GQRLO,"According to NF, his mother came to believe that she had ""Created a Frankenstein"", and there could possibly be some truth to this assessment.  From what I can gather, he has emerged as a self-made political and social pariah, and his unusual high-pitched voice adds a somewhat hysterical flavor to the overall oddness. At one point, he draws an analogy, comparing himelf to Albert Einstein. According to the film, he can't find a teaching job and hasn't been able to hold the ones he's had. By NF's account, this is due to his anti-establishment line, and the fact that his enemies are legion and relentlessly pursuing him for his beliefs.  One such critic is even demonized as a plagiarist, although the charges were later determined to be unfounded.  Keep in mind that there are many vociferous anti-establishment types who have succeeded immensely in academia--most notably NF's friend Noam Chomsky.

In any case, this film portrays a pretty angry man who now makes a fairly decent living eviscerating his critics and promoting his books to enthusiastic students in Canada, many of whom are shown wearing Middle Eastern garb.  He clobbers his opponents remorselessly, and there may even be something of a sadistic steak when he is questioned by weeping college student.  I think I read somewhere that NF (or his supporters) believe that that student was a ""Plant.""  But does it really matter?  NF thought she was genuine at the time.  Just saying.

In sum, I heartily give this film 4-stars for its originality, production values and the eccentricity of its subject. You will not be disappointed if you have any interest in things political. Judging from his modest living arrangements, success on the college speaking tour, his extensive international travel and notoriety, the man has probably accomplished many of his goals. How many of us can say the same? Or find ourselves actually starring in a movie?",1275696000,9,1911,5.0

8391300,4,B0038GQRLO,"I liked it a lot.
I liked the way the camera follows him and how this documentary
truly shows what Norman Finkelstein truly thinks as he said it himself he gives his opinion
and says what he feels.
I heard him say that he agrees with Hezbollah and that they are doing a good thing
( Israel needs to get hit on the head). Hezbollah is a terrorist group who has no problem
to kill civilians in Israel.
Not everyone in Israel agrees with its politics but Hezbollah does not make any difference.
 Norman Finkelstein  has something odd about him, he is not diplomatic at all and I truly
believe he was marked by his childhood by his mother's views who were quite radical
themselves.
Norman has hatred in him for the State of Israel and I believe for Jewish people themselves
unless they agree with him.
I thought something was odd about his behavior he seems a bit over the top and he
just cannot let go.
When he said Alan Derschowitz was a plagiarist he was full of contempt and he just
could not and would not let it go. He had to write about it and on and on.
I believe watching this documentary that Norman Finkelstein is not able to restrain
it is one thing to have an opinion yet it is another to incite people to do radical acts.
Just how he said Hezbollah does a good time is a violent comment and in my
eyes I feel Norman Finkelstein is a liability and I do applaud the state of Israel
to ban him to enter this small country surrounded by ennemies, especially when we
always hear the Jews in Israel need to be pushed to the sea.
I feel sorry for Norman Finkelstein's inner turmoil and at the same time
I am disgusted by his comments",1501286400,,1636,4.240384615384615

8391302,5,B0038GQRLO,"How can one write a review about an excellent documentation which proves that a single individual may be able to rightly debunk contemporary Jewish establishment's propaganda and, at the same time, mostly keeps utterly dislikable even for sympathizers of the Palestinian cause? A son of Holocaust (upper case) survivors who pathologically desires to suffer more than his late parents, Finkelstein has fellthrough his entire academic life. The documentary provides some revealing reasons. Of course, the most obvious, one has to seriously take into account of being smashed when challenging gloomy and wicked luminaries [sic] like Dersh in public. Finkelstein in all likelihood craved for being smashed, eventually ending up in a small flat in Brooklyn. Anyway tragic. We certainly need him.",1446336000,,790,5.537190082644628
8391303,3,B0038GQRLO,"A quick bio of Finkelstein, an outspoken Jew with bones to pick in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and an overview of the troubles spawned by his controversial stances. He's a rare voice in the sense that his opinions place him at-odds with his religious homeland, decrying the lack of a Palestinian state and brow-beating the Israeli government for their part in allegedly whitewashing the conflict. It should come as no surprise that such a vocal, incendiary stance has made him all manner of powerful enemies, and his sharp, confrontational personal nature does him no further favors in that respect. Finkelstein at his best is intriguing, an engaging speaker with a fiery streak and the credentials, both personal and scholastic, to back him up against any opponent. Sadly, he also seems doomed to a fate of self-contradiction. He often employs the very same methods in his own tricky public speaking engagements that he vehemently decries in the opposition, even if this documentary does try its very best to clip and trim around such moments. It's just one side of a very complicated debate, and while he does make some convincing points that refute the official story from the United States and Israel, it can be difficult to accept his story and make a judgment without an equally eloquent counterpoint in play.",1434931200,2,1321,5.036529680365297

8391305,5,B0038GQRLO,I can only repeat the praises of the other reviews. This is a very good documentary. Norman Finkelstein's personality is depicted with subtlety.

8391308,5,B0038GQRLO,"I just finished reading ""The Holocaust Industry,"" before watching this documentary, which was a nice lead in.  Dr. Finkelstein inspires through the courage of his convictions, the clarity of his thought, and his commitment to knowledge and scholarship.  In another age he would have been burned at the stake as a heretic for offending Mother Church.  In today's world he is denied tenure and the ability to secure a permanent teaching position, and hated by those who benefit from the modern power structures of state/corporate power. Through his mother, and the inter-generational trauma impact of the Holocaust on his family, Finkelstein has come to honor all who suffer, rather than placing a special significance or importance on the suffering of any particular group. Through possessing the moral integrity to universalize his understanding of human suffering, as his mother did, he shows himself to be humanitarian of immense moral courage, capable of inspiring even those of us who've seen too much, and who struggle to find or maintain hope for a better world for our grandchildren.  Thanks to Norman and to the film makers for encouraging hope, not through any mindless, ""let's all think happy thoughts for a better world,"" fluff, but through the example of tireless courage and moral integrity in standing with those the world prefers to pretend don't exist or don't matter.  Highly recommended as a reminder of what true strength and courage look like.",1364515200,,1463,5.156118143459915
8391309,5,B0038GQRLO,"In the limited time of a documentary, this film presents beautifully the fascinating personality of a Jewish man whose life has been guided by courage and principles, instead of self-centeredness, and mean interests, like most of our lives are.

In a country and in a world which praises and admires a Donald Trump, Norman Finkelstein may seem incomprehensible and outlandish. But since this world is not entirely corrupt, and since truth has the miraculous power of permeating man's conscience, his words and his actions never fell on barren land.

Normal Finkelstein is not one of the ""rich and famous"", shallow, worthless role models whom America adores. He is not a very well off man and he is a modest man, in spite of the assertive tone of his speeches; it is the intrinsic truthfulness of his idea which gives him the moral authority to speak assertively. He is a brave man and his life has been full of meaning and dedicated to truth and justice, notwithstanding the price he had to pay for that.

Dr. Finkelstein says ""Please, don't put me in a pedestal, 'cause you'll end up being disappointed""--this is an expression of his modesty, but in fact, a truism because every man is an innate sinner. But there are sinners and sinners. If man lost forever his primordial sanctity, there are, even in this degenerate world, men who strive to reach at least a certain facet of it. One needs to mention that Finkelstein is an atheist but I am convinced that at the end of the earthly life, God will wait for him in the Garden of Eden, the Hall of Valhalla or the Elysian Fields. In fact, this man is a living proof of that there is an Absolute Truth which transcends human reason but enlightens human heart like an inexhaustible beacon.",1361059200,3,1737,4.669934640522876
