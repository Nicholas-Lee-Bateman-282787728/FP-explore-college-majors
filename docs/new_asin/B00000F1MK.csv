7906284,4,B00000F1MK,"H.P. Lovecraft wrote a short story entitled ""The Unnamable"", about 2 friends in a park at night talking about a local urban legend.  In the story, the 2 are debating about whether or not something can truly be so horribly indescribable as to be literally unnamable. Of course, in true Lovecraft fashion, the story ends with the skeptical one being able to see for himself.

Lovecraft's stories are notoriously difficult to adapt to the medium of film because they rely so much on his fevered and desperate prose to create atmosphere.  At best, movies can only copy the concepts, names and some plot points and stamp his name on it to sell.  This movie is no exception;  it is about a group of college students that encounter the ""unnamable"", the creature that is the subject of the urban legend recounted in the short story.  The story itself is recounted in the film (as it is in the story) as the back story of the creature, and the house in the back story is where the college students end up spending the night.  Typical B-movie set up, this movie is very low budget and the film quality is horrible.  However, it has a fun, conspiratorial feel to it, much like the original ""Halloween"", appealing to young peoples' love of scaring themselves by doing creepy things at night in spooky places.  The creature is rather disturbing, considering the back story which is nightmarish if strongly familiar these days.  If you keep in mind what it is, a spooky, youth oriented, old fashioned tongue-in-cheek scream-fest, you'll enjoy this.  Rated R but not super gory by today's standards.  The sequel to this film features a lot of nudity, sort of takes the teeth out of the creature and incompetently tries to capitalize on the humor side of it.  Highly recommend the first, recommend the second with reservations.",1525132800,,1811,4.747603833865814
7906285,5,B00000F1MK,"One of my very favorite horror films of all time. Sadly, I cannot find it on DVD and I've been looking for as long as DVDs have been available. As reiterated by other reviewers, this really needs to be converted to DVD. What are you waiting for?",1508630400,,245,4.23404255319149
7906286,5,B00000F1MK,"Saw this when I was like 11 or 12 and have been trying to remember the title for years, now I remember it but it's not available for streaming anywhere.. I did find a ""link"" to it but it was in german...

boo ...  anyway, it's a fantastic horror film that nobody knows about really, it's not high budget horror but the makeup effects are great and the mood it sets in the house is scary enough to enjoy.",1506729600,,403,4.0886075949367084
7906287,5,B00000F1MK,"Great movie for Sci fi fans. Alida, hexed with a demon, is separated from the demon when a professor reads an unbinding spell. The demon wants her back and chases her all over town. Scary, funny, and worth watching. If you have kids, there is some mild nudity. I found this movie on VHS and bought it about 10 yrs ago. I have been waiting for it to be put on DVD. I have Unnameable II as well, the sequel, also a good movie for sci fi buffs.",1478563200,2,441,4.0227272727272725
7906288,5,B00000F1MK,"I was four years old when this movie came out. Since my father is a huge horror fan, he rented it and I was allowed to watch it. It was my introduction to the amazing world of monster movies. What better way to begin than with Lovecraft? I've been a horror junkie ever since.

The movie is actually a blend of The Unnamable, The Dunwich Horror and probably some more stories. Sure, its cheesy and pure '80s, but that's what makes it so enjoyable! Since this movie was my first, my review may be a little biased, but if you're looking for an atmospheric flick with a spooky old house, a cool monster, carnage and diddling college co-eds for your Halloween festivities, then look no further.

In closing, allow me to reiterate what fellow reviewers have stated... To whomever holds the rights to this gem, please GIVE US A BLU RAY AND DVD RELEASE! YOU RELEASED PART 2 ON DVD! WHY IN THE NAME OF OUR DARK LORD CTHULHU DID YOU SKIP OVER THIS ONE?!

(You can find both movies on DVD in a combo pack but they're for region 2 players and, if memory serves, rather expensive. So if you havethe cash to shell out for the discs and ccorrect player, by all means, go for it!)",1443139200,6,1164,4.330275229357798
