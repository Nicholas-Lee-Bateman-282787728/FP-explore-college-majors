8241126,5,B00119XOAM,"North Korea invited an ABC news crew into its country in 2005 to convince the world that they have nuclear weapons. The trip was the outcome of ten years of ABC efforts. Minders were with the group 24-hours/day, and provided translation (ABC could not bring its own). Pyongyang proved to have numerous tall buildings, but its stoplights were all off. No taxis were visible, and most of the populace was ordered out to transplant rice. The ABC team also showed Kim Il Sung's classroom and desk, but none of the reported 3.5 - 5 million starving citizens. North Koreans are taught that the U.S. started the Korean War, and its bombing killed a large number of civilians (the latter is true). Finally, the ABC crew also went onto the U.S.N. Pueblo, but the DVD failed to show the guide's response when asked ""Is there anything about the U.S. that you like?""

Current relations with North Korea deteriorated considerably during the Bush II administration - comments about the ""Axis of Evil,"" hating Kim Il Jong, and Rumsfeld's sense that the U.S. would not invade if North Korea had nuclear weapons are credited with creating considerable concern.

The DVD's last segment showed brief moments of the Korean War, and explained how North Korea's having missiles and nuclear weapons created strong leverage to prevent Japan's involvement in any future efforts to defend South Korea.",1245542400,,1375,4.9480519480519485
