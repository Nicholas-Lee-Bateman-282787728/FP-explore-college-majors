8499722,4,B006JN8702,"From my midwestern, American perspective, kangaroos are exotic, Aussie accents are exotic, and so is Aussie scenery.  This is fun viewing precisely because ""the grass is greener on the other side.""  I recently saw ""Raccoon Nation"" and while I enjoyed that an animal is getting smarter and learning to adapt to human environments, raccoons can be rabid.  Late one night I had one stand near my car and hiss at me.  When you open a garbage container and find a raccoon inside, be prepared to gasp.  Although kangaroos are much taller, they seemed so much more harmless.

They just entered human territories because there was a longstanding draught.  Once there was water and grass elsewhere, they went back home.  You don't see them knocking over garbage cans like bears or raccoons on my continent.  In fact, this work implies that pet dogs are more likely to harm them than the other way around.

Remember when they showed an Ewok get killed in ""Return of the Jedi""?  Well, not all the imagery here is cute.  One expert said mother kangaroos will throw away their young if they are being chased by a predator.

So many presentations of Australia show all kinds of exotic marsupials.  This work does not, however.  So if you wanted to see koalas and wombats and platypuses, you will be disappointed.

Like many a documentary, the work also pats the scientists on their backs who are finding new and clever ways to find out answers on animal behavior.",1329868800,,1449,4.736
