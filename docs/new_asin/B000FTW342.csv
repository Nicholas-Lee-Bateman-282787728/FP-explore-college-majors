2587983,4,B000FTW342,Bought when my son turned 4 - he's now 5 and still enjoys watching it. Worth the price. I am always impressed by Popular MEchanics for kids.,1247788800,,140,4.222222222222222
2587984,3,B000FTW342,"I hate to knock the Popular Mecanics videos, but I have to a little. On one level they are really well done, but the frenetic feel and the too wise kids, give it a harder edge, imo, than our other videos about rescue or science related subjects. I bought several of these videos and have pushed them to the back, in favor of those with more genuine real characters and a less intense feel. I much prefer Fred Levine's and one we have called ""Kids Love Fire Engines"" made by David and Cameron Barrett. I'll probably resell this one, I'm sorry to say.",1218499200,,549,4.339805825242719

8126606,5,B000FTW342,"""PM Kids"" videos are fantastic. I am amazed at how my 4-yr old retains facts gained from these videos. They are informative, interesting and a big step up from the little-kid videos we had (Here Comes a Train/Truck/Garbage Truck, etc...). I hightly recommend these - my boys love them, and they're far better than watching TV while I cook dinner!",1323129600,,346,4.783333333333333

The Popular Mechanics for Kids shows are lots of fun and teaches kids many things about science. I have bought most of the DVDs. My son watched the DVDs in a car when we were driving to the beach. It kept him busy for a while.,1280620800,,354,3.9305555555555554

In this dvd the kid hosts get to learn about fighting a forest fire, being a police officer. One even gets to shoot a gun!
Fly along in a helicopter on a man hunt. These kids get to do it all.
My 5 year old boy loves these programs. The first two were so enjoyed I bought the rest of the series.
This was a series on tv at one time, apparently. I hope they package the rest of the programs because the show was fab.
Each dvd has 4 episodes that are somewhat related. The 2 kid hosts explore different aspects of each subject.
Some are surprising but all are interesting, informative and they are professionally made.
In earlier reviews of this series I forgot to mention that grown ups find these programs interesting as well.
My husband and I love them as well.",1260057600,,1017,5.436708860759493
