8077850,5,B000AD23E8,"I wish this movie were available to US audiences in either

dvd or VHS format. I taped this movie a few years ago on a cable

tv channel and fell in love with it. I loved not only the story but also the cast. Pia Miranda, Kick Gurry, Anthony Lapaglia and Greta Scacci do an incredible job.

If you ever have the chance to see this movie, watch it. The motorcycle  on the bridge scene is a real adrenaline rush.",1134432000,4,603,4.271929824561403
