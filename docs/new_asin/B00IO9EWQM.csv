6283882,5,B00IO9EWQM,"""Fort Apache"" (1948) is a classic black and white western filmed in the majestic Monument Valley. It is also the first in the renowned director John Ford's Cavalry Trilogy. The other two are ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" (1949) and ""Rio Grande"" (1950).

""Fort Apache"" is set in a western frontier cavalry post in the 1870s. The post is monitoring the local Apaches who have left their reservation. John Wayne plays Kirby York, the sensible second in command. Henry Fonda is Owen Thursday, the new commander. Thursday is a vain, pedantic officer who wants battle glory in order to return to a prestigious eastern posting. York respects the fighting abilities of the Apaches, but Thursday ignorantly disparages them.

The regiment rides out to the Apaches' location. York meets with their leaders to begin their peaceable return to the reservation. Thursday, however, recklessly forces a needless battle, and sends York to the back of the line for alleged cowardice after he wisely counsels for a peaceful resolution. The result is the near annihilation of the regiment and also Thursday's desperate death. His horse is shot out from under him. He manically borrows another one to return to a stranded stand of soldiers on foot. There he is killed.

The movie ends with York, as the then commander, in his headquarters talking with a group of reporters. They all want to know of Thursday's ""heroic"" death, as York stands by a painting heroically depicting that death. Wayne goes along with the myth for the good of his beloved cavalry, which he poetically describes in its duties.

The movie has drama through the conflicting views of York and Thursday, and by Thursday's heedless, Custer-like actions. Evidently, also, Thursday previously accused the outgoing commander, an earlier friend, played by George O'Brien, of cowardice. This creates an underlying tension.

The battle scenes between the cavalry and the Apaches are exciting. The movement of the Apaches on horses and the cavalry on horses and in wagons is splendidly staged. The ""last stand"" of Thursday and his soldiers is movingly shot.

The film realistically portrays cavalry life on the 1870s western frontier. The uniforms and civilian dress and the military protocol and formations seem accurate. The buildings are rough-hewn, and the indoor decor fits the time and place. The ball for Washington's Birthday, with the historical dance movements, adds a touch of versimilitude.

Included are winning touches of Ford's trademark humor and camaraderie, supplied by Victor Mclaglen as a gruff but sentimental seargeant and by others of Ford's stock company. Ford's usual element of romance is not forsaken: John Agar, as a newly-minted West Point lieutenant, courts Thursday's smitten daughter, played by Agar's then real-life wife Shirley Temple. He received a presidential commission to the Academy since his master sergeant father, played by Ford favorite Ward Bond, was a Medal of Honor recipient in the Civil War. Thursday disapproves of the courtship, but to no avail. He snobbishly thinks the son of an enlisted Irish man is not good enough for his daughter.

""Fort Apache"" is a great movie by one of the best directors in the history of cinema, with a superb cast in leading and supporting roles. It is well worth viewing.

As an aside, Wayne and Fonda each made many wonderful movies with Ford, especially the Duke.",1462579200,2,3383,5.1030741410488245
