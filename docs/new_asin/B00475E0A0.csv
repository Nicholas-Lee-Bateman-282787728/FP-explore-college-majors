This DVD is one I have added to this list of mine.

4279481,5,B00475E0A0,"This is one of the long series of New Year's Day concerts from Vienna. It follows the usual and well-tried format, and on this occasion delivers rather more than the usual very reliable level of enjoyment. This may not come as too much of a surprise as Welser-Most's Viennese credentials have been recognised and supported by a major bank in Upper Austria for over 25 years as a cultural envoy for upper Austria. This level of commitment to Welser-Most is more than justified by this particular release.

Right from the start Welser-Most judges both the occasion and the feel of the music perfectly and chooses the perfect tempo, crucial to dance music, with unerring accuracy. On this occasion there are six works performed that have a family connection with the conductor. These are explained in the informative booklet supplied with the disc. Other items of unusual interest are the Mephisto Waltz by Liszt plus Hellmesberger II's Zigeunertanz.

The whole concert is infused by an unusual level of sheer joy. This is clearly felt by the whole audience who give prolonged and rapturous applause at the end. The players equally respond with enthusiasm and their customary skill giving Welser-Most the accolade of their own applause at the end too.

The recording by the highly experienced Brian Large is particularly excellent with sympathetic camera work and crisp imaging which is shown to good effect on the Blu-ray format. The sound is presented in DTS and stereo formats.

The bonus items include the usual ballet sequences plus a resum&eacute; of the orchestra's 2010 Baltic cruise.

This is highly recommended therefore and could well be on a short list of the most successful of this popular series. It is hard to imagine future purchasers resisting its many charms.

4279483,5,B00475E0A0,"Outstanding performance by mastero Franz Welser-Most and the Vienna philhormonic, together they bring back ""life"" of Waltzes very refind work done by both conductor and the ochestra.  Very impressive!",1302307200,3,200,5.896551724137931
4279484,5,B00475E0A0,"This DVD is a must-have for any classical music collection, especially if you happen to live in the USA where the day-of b'cast of this concert has turned into a nearly unwatchable torso of the concert that was actually given. The PBS concert typically does a great disservice to the affair, with poor sound, out-of-sync visual and audio, the addition of a narrator/host who adds little if anything to the concert, and worst of all, the cramming of the concert into a 90-minute format that necessitates the exclusion of one or two pieces from the concert to accommodate the addition of the host, etc (the worst of which had to be the generic and useless voice over that PBS inserted over the playing of the Radetsky March! Why they couldn't have waited until the music ended and placed their promotional announcement over the production credits scroll that continued to roll after the music had ended beats me).

None of those blemishes exist on the DVD, where one can enjoy the concert for what it was - a concert.

Franz-Welser Mst does an excellent job of it, playing a few interesting new pieces while delivering the goods on the tried and true. The Vienna Philharmonic is also on top form and responds beautifully to FWM.

After the disappointment of the 2009 concert with Barenboim on the podium, it's nice to see the VPO and the New Year's Day concert itself back on it's solid, traditional footing. And it's good that Universal continues to release these concerts on DVD. Otherwise, those of us in the USA would never get to experience this b'cast in anything but the messed-up PBS version.

Highly recommended.",1300060800,8,1619,4.771428571428571
4279485,5,B00475E0A0,"We originally saw this concert on PBS television and were completely overwhelmed by the beauty of the entire production. I am not much of a ballet fan but the performance here literally brought my wife and I to tears they were so beautiful. The venues in which they dance, the costumes and the talent of the dancers are absolutely beautiful. The music, of course is so fitting to the New Years celebration and the Vienna Concert Hall is breathtaking. My only criticism is the DVD is not exactly the same editing as the PBS program which I prefer. The dance sequences and some of the commentary are mixed in with the concert where the DVD shows 2 dances as ""bonus"" features. Still, I have purchased several copies to distribute to friends and this is a thoroughly enjoyable DVD. If your a fan of ballet, classical music, Strauss and the annual New Years Eve concert you will NOT be disappointed!",1296000000,13,894,4.628930817610063
4279486,5,B00475E0A0,"Several considerations seem to have guided the selection of items performed in the 2011 New Year Concert from Vienna. A least one was probably urged by the conductor, Franz Welser-Mst himself. It was at a Vienna dance hall, owned by the conductor's ancestor, that the 19 year-old Johann Strauss Jnr was given the opportunity to present some of his first compositions to the public, compositions included in this concert. Another consideration was the need to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Liszt's birth. Liszt's quirky Mephisto Waltz No 1 is included here; it shows what a very different musical mind Liszt had to that of Johann Strauss Jnr.
All combine to make this New Year Concert as rich an entertainment as can be found anywhere in any year. There are some luscious waltzes (and one less so) and the dance sequences are notable for their perfect coordination with the music. And watch to see where the dancers end up at the conclusion of ""The Blue Danube""!",1295308800,15,966,4.86060606060606
8417786,5,B00475E0A0,"As other reviews have pointed out these concerts are broadcasted, but the editing is always atrocious. It is nice to see the whole concert presented in its original form. While Franz Welser-Most seems to have annoyed people just about everywhere he has been is still one of my favorite conductors. 2011 is in my humble opinion one of the best in this long running series.",1488240000,2,371,4.723076923076923

8417795,5,B00475E0A0,Only to point out that AmazonUS says this disc has a running time of 60 minutes - which of course would mean a very truncated version of the PBS broadcast. But both AmazonUK and AmazonGermany say it's twice as long - 120 minutes.  AmazonUK also includes a track list of 18 individual pieces - very difficult to cram into 60 minutes.  All of which informs me this DVD is a full presentation of by the best New Years Eve concert I can ever remember. Especially compared to the lame 2012 affair.,1352073600,,492,4.395604395604396
