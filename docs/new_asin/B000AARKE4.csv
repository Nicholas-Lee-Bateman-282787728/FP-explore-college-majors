8077277,5,B000AARKE4,"This is a Sony Playstation Portable (PSP) UMD Media Disk copy of the first volume of the televised Cowboy Bebop. Any fan of Japanese Anime or animation in general is missing out if they haven't seen Bebop. It is simply one of the greatest works of art of that medium period. The disk is great as you will have a portable taste of Bebop wherever you go.

This leads to it's number one problem, it is only a taste. This is just the first two episodes which is all volume 1 contains. Plus as this is a UMD there aren't any further volumes of this classic being released, so it is likely to leave you wanting more. Still if you are building an PSP UMD video library (Which is a lot of fun to do) this disk deserves a place in that collection hands down.",1310342400,2,749,4.165517241379311
