1260877,5,B0000399WG,"I am really a big Batman Beyond fan. I had so many expectations and hopes for Terry McGuiness.  When it came out on television, I have recorded every episode since, so I have somewhat a little archive going.  In this dvd, you  get 4 episodes for the price of 2 on VHS.. at least I think theres two on  VHS. But either way, WOW. Not only do you get good episodes, you get the  outstanding quality of dvd.  By looking at the technical information, you  can see what episodes are on the dvd but you must buy the dvd to see the  episodes (um, it seems we have a paradox...well. I hope thats what the word  paradox means. Oh well) .  On the dvd you get to see the actual first  Batman Beyond movie and you can really get into it.  The music is, well,  beyond good.:-)  and I was extremely happy to have gotten it.  I still  watch it to this date.  Please say whether or not my review was helpful  and possibly even check out some of my others.  If you have any questions  for Batman Beyond, or some of my other reviews, please feel free to e-mail  me at ss9303goku@aol.com  . Thank you.",963014400,8,1081,4.145631067961165
1260878,5,B0000399WG,"Batman Beyond is totally one of the greatest action packed cartoons ever made. To me, Batman Beyond is much more better than the original. It's much more highteck and has much more action adventures. Totally 5 stars.",952732800,,216,4.864864864864865
1260879,3,B0000399WG,"I love Batman the Animated Series, and I was extremely anxious to see Batman Beyond.  However, I came out a little disappointed.  What really attracted me to Batman was the fact that if someone was rich enough, they  could really do it.  The gadgets, vehicles, etc. that Batman used weren't  too far fetched.  Also, I really liked that Batman was big and menacing  with a deep voice, and a big jaw.  He really looked the part.
This new  Batman, however, is more like Nightwing, who I liked as a side character  only.  He is short and skinny.  The technologies he has may not be far  fetched in the future, but you can't tell since we don't live in that  time.
That said, I love how they have incorporated Bruce Wayne as the  grumpy old man.  I also love how they have injected some life into the  Batman franchise.  I may not like the stature of the new Batman, but it was  most likely necessary to fit him into the mold of what is popular these  days.
As far as the DVD is concerned, Bravo!  They could have just  given us the Batman Beyond movie, but they took advantage of what the DVD  technology has to offer, and they added 4 additional episodes.  I hope to  see more of Batman Beyond on DVD in the near future.",946857600,2,1217,4.278761061946903
1260880,5,B0000399WG,"First off, I'm not that avid a fan of the new Batman Beyond series as Terry seems like a token Kyle Rayner(Green Lantern). Both have better powers/suits but don't quite know what to do with them yet. So, I won't  comment on the story as I'd be more critical of them, but I do like how the  dvd was packaged. You get the tv movie plus four more episodes, and the  quality of the source is great. Much, much better than the transfer they  did with the Mask Of the Phantasm dvd. I'd recommend this dvd on value  alone even if you don't like the new Batman.",946598400,5,553,4.130841121495327

This, is just speaking on the value vs. the VHS version.  The VHS version gives you 'The Movie' and that's it. The DVD gives you tons  more value, and it has a french language track for those of you who's  Primary language is French. Oui? Now. On to the story. Batman Beyond as a  whole is a wonderful departure but continuation of the legacy of Batman. We  get to see Bruce Wayne, not as the hero, but as a mentor for a new Batman.  Set in the future of Gotham City, Bruce Wayne has long since hung up his  cowl (although the opening scene has him as Batman but I don't wish to  spoil it) and has sit by and watched his own company become corrupt. There  are some nice references to the original Animated Series and it ties in  beautifully. If you're an Animated Series fan, I HIGHLY recommend this  great value on DVD.

Intro: Batman Beyond: the Future of All of the Batvillains; A 'Free verse' Poem: an Article

by

Mark Walt Meredith

The creators of BATMAN THE ANIMATED SERIES had reached nearly as far as they could go with the waning popularity of the stories.

The popularity of the Batman characters in an animated series was reaching the end for that time and the creators needed to revamp the series to give it a few more seasons, and that came in loud and clear from the lowering ratings numbers.

Something bad just had to happen to, the Batman, Mr. Wayne, to give him obstacles, to make, Batman, a supporting character, and there needed to be someone to become the revamped Batman.

As in the comic book version of The Dark Knight Returns the writers on the show had agreed that Bruce Wayne having heart problems was a cool idea.

The creators decided that they should have, Wayne, get old and have the spin off series take place in the future.

The voice of Jack Napier/the Joker had left the series, the voice of Robin 2, the Boy Wonder had quit, as well as Harley Quinn's voice had quit the animated series.

The creators of the cartoons had designed a costume that was more like a second skin than a costume.

The costume seemingly had no boots, no gloves, and no gray tights.

The costume was black so that, Batman, couldn't be seen in dark alleys; yet the mask part covered the whole face.

The only opening for the new Batman's mouth was a small one that made his mask look like the mask itself had a mouth.

The mouth made the outfit look even more like the new BATMAN had ebony skin.

Some people in the past have thought that, Batman, was always a giant bat or some kind of demon.

That fact is probably because there are some times when, Batman moves so fast and stealthily with Ninjutsu that all others would see are the shadow-filled cape, cowl and ""those eyes"" with the white contact lenses in them.

Criminals don't get to see, Batman's, shadowy lower face nor do they see the shadowy gray costume.

The cape and cowl are shaped as if the capes bottom were a bat's wings.

Look at, Wayne's, cape and look at a bat's wings and the truth of this comparison is clear.

Since Batman Beyond has come along, Batman, has employed the use of claws on, Batman's, gloved fingers to scare criminals as well as a cape made of faux leather shaped to look biologically as if they were cut off of some giant bat...complete with fake wing bone shapes in the fake leather.

Batman isn't the kind of super hero to actually cut criminals with, Wayne's, clawed fingertips but the claws make the Batman more intimidating to super-criminals.

Meredith-2 Intro: BATMAN BEYOND: the Future of All of the Bat villains; an Ar . .

In the future of the animated series Mr. Napier has disappeared for some reason and no one brings up what happened to Mr. Napier but ""now"" there is a notorious gang that is based in, Wayne's, city of Gotham.

Citizens of Gotham have to contend with a gang that robs people on the streets dressed as clowns and wearing Hallow'een' costumes.

The name of the gang is: ""Jokerz.""_

_ The new BATMAN the animated series was deluged with letters wanting to know where Mr. Napier had gone to and to have Mr. Napier back.

There were so many letters avalanching the creators of Batman Beyond that Joker's return would have to be a direct to-video movie called Batman Beyond: the Return of the Joker!

The makers of Batman Beyond talked to the voice actor that used to play Mr. Napier in BATMAN THE ANIMATED SERIES who happened to be Mark Hamil.

The creators of the Batman series told Hamil about the flood of letters that came in and the creators of the spin-off called Batman Beyond practically begged Hamil to work with the creators once again one last time as a guest appearance in the makers of Batman Beyonds' movie and Hamil said, ""yes!""

The makers of Batman Beyond asked the voice of Harley Quinn the Harlequin to come back as a guest star also and she agreed as well.

In the beginning of the ""direct to DVD"" ""Jokerz"" are being led ""in the background"" by a ""Mr. Napier/Joker"" that wears all black and short, greased back green hair.

It is a revamped ""Mr. Napier"" of the future that knows everything about, Wayne,...somehow.

It turns out that by the future ... Mr. Napier had been killed by being electrocuted by Timothy Drake Robin 2.

Mr. Napier had brainwashed Tim Drake into the evil ""Joker, Junior.""

During the final conflict at the destroyed Arkham Asylum ... Harley Quinn fell into a pit and supposedly died even though, Batman could never find the body of ""Harley Quinn.""

The Harlequin as a super villain had never been seen again.

In the end of the original Mr. Napier's last battle ""Joker, Junior"" finally turned on Mr. Napier as Tim Drake began laughing and crying, with two electric cables electrocuted Mr. Napier.

After that battle Tim Drake quit being Robin Boy Wonder, there was never a Robin Boy Wonder again.

Tim Drake blamed, Wayne, for the traumatic event and hadn't talked to, Batman, since that.

Batman had never tried to talk to Tim Drake after that..., Batman, blaming himself.

Tim Drake moved to another city and got a job fixing satellite dishes.

Batman never fixed things between, Batman, and Tim Drake.

Mr. Napier had put a tiny, metallic ""dot"" on Tim Drake with circuitry in it holding the ""sum total"" of Joker's personality that would change Tim Drake into ""Joker"" 2 in the future.

The Royal Flush Gang was in the cartoon named THE SUPER FRIENDS as a disguised man named only the King formed and gathered one-by-one a team called only Royal Flush Gang.

When King and after he created Royal Flush Gang...King revealed he was secretly ""Joker!""

Royal Flush Gang happened to be in BATMAN THE ANIMATED SERIES and, Batman, stopped Royal Flush Gang for a long time though eventually obviously they had reformed.

Royal Flush Gang had members like King, Ten, Ace and Jack.

By the ""future"" of Batman Beyond the leader of Royal Flush Gang was Jack who had by then become the King II.

Ace II was still the un-aging hulking android with all of the weaknesses of the Justice League of America: New Frontier built into Ace II's powers.

Ace II can change Ace II's surface to yellow for the Green Lantern and can use fire against, Batman, the Martian Manhunter.

The King II had hired a new bloodthirsty Jack II, the King III's new wife had become the Queen II and the King II's new daughter ""was become"" the new Ten.

Meredith-3 Intro: BATMAN BEYOND: the Future of All of the Batvil . .

Meredith-4 Intro: BATMAN BEYOND: the Future of All of the Bat . .

_ Mr. ""Freeze"" Victor Freis had gotten a disease in the past and had he frozen solid until humanity could find a cure for this disease.

By the time of the animated spin off Batman Beyond, mankind had found a cure and had unfrozen Freeze to cure Freeze.

Batman MacGuiness had shadowed him to see if he was on the ""straight-and narrow"" or not and the events turned out to be Freeze had turned over a new leaf.

 the future, there was an outbreak of designer drugs that had been outlawed by that point in time.

 The future had the abuse of a steroid that was used by, Batman's, old enemy to make ""Bane"" super-strong and more cunning.

The drug was called Venom and by that time, it had been synthesized into a patch form that could be absorbed into the skin.

Once the jocks in high school had slapped one of those Venom patches on their arms...the veins leading from the area of the patch would stand out immediately and the Venom abuser in general would become human looking hulks twice their size.

Batmanwent to find the source of the illegal patches.

Batmantraveled to the residence of ""Bane..."" ... and sneaked through the security guarding his mansion.

Batmangot through to ""Bane...""..., and then Mr. McGuiness saw that Bane was wearing an oxygen mask; unhealthily scrawny; lanky and sitting in a love seat, unresponsive.

When a Doctor saw young Batman...... ... Batman asked, ""What happened to him""?!

Meredith-5 Intro: BATMAN BEYOND: the Fu . .

The guard said, ""Too many years on Venom"".

_Mr. MacGuiness went out and found the real distributor of the patches who wasn't Bane, stopping the flow of the dangerous drug forever.

One of ""Jokerz'"" gang is a ""more modern"" version of Jonathan Crane the Scarecrow from the movie THE DARK KNIGHT and BATMAN BEGINS.

He wears a scarecrow Halloween' outfit and keeps weapons in a plastic Jack O lantern with a carrying handle that the Jack O lantern hangs from.

_Spellbinder from BATMAN IN DETECTIVE COMICS the comic book series shows up the time of Batman Beyond as well.

Instead of being a corny supercriminal from the 60's with an eye design on his mask forehead, a swirl insignia on Spellbinder's chest and a red costume ... Spellbinder in Batman Beyond has a full face mask with a red and black swirl design that continues down Spellbinder's skin tight bodysuit like an ""insane"" Spider-Man.

On his palm is an eye design that Spellbinder used to hypnotize people. . .

1260900,5,B0000399WG,"This ""movie"" is basically the two-part pilot of the series ""Batman Beyond"".  Nevertheless, it's a fine taste for anyone new to the new Dark Knight.  As far as origin stories go, this one is pretty good.  In fact, it holds up nicely when compared to the animated Superman's origin episode ""The Last Son of Krypton"".  When its characters, setting, and the story beyond this movie are considered, it's one of the finest superhero origin stories out there.  It also gives us the one thing that Batman:  The Animated Series never did.  But perhaps that's for the best as practically everyone knows Bruce Wayne's story and few knew Terry McGinnis's tale before this.  Again, it's very good, combining corruption and greed to intertwine the new Batman's beginnings with a cover-up and a nefarious international deal.  The new villain, Derek Powers, now the head of Wayne Enterprises after a hostel takeover, is evil and malicious in his own right, so comparisons to Lex Luthor shouldn't be made.  For one thing, Powers seems to be more willing to get his hands dirty as I'm sure Luthor would not have been anywhere near that loading dock.  His henchman, Mr. Fixx, is also very good.  Seriously, what's with that guy's eyes?  You may know he's no good from his first appearance, but you won't be prepared for what he's willing to do.  In the villains' category, I also liked these gangs called ""Jokerz"" who obviously are trying to emulate the Clown Prince of Crime himself.  They're a neat new menace and can certainly help draw fans of the original Batman animated series over to this new show.  This ""movie"" is a great start to a great series.

1260901,5,B0000399WG,"This is a good movie. But if you are going to buy the Batman Beyond series, season 1 starts off with this movie as its beginning episodes and continues on into following episodes. I recommend buying the series, it is a continuation of the Batman: The Animated Series and has the same character voices. I also recommend finishing the Batman animated story line with Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker. It has all the original character voices from Batman: The Animated Series and finalizes the entire story line nicely.

I like the crotchety misanthrope Bruce Wayne, but not the rest of the characters. A future Gotham City is an interesting idea, but the animation seems to be a bit off and the hero annoys me. I did not bother to pick up the whole season. Sometimes the villains are more interesting than the heroes and this is one of those cases.

I know it's blasphemy since it's not Bruce Wayne, but I just love the fact the show was almost a hybrid between Spiderman and Batman. I mean you have Spiderman's real-life problems coupled with Batman's money and resources to explain all the trinkets. I also just really like the suit with its powers to fly and invisibility. Maybe it's not ""Batman"" exactly but it was a great cartoon.

The movie is basically just the pilot of the series. It shows how Bruce Wayne stops being Batman and Terry McGinnis becomes Batman. It also introduces a pretty cool villain, the boss who has Terry's father killed. When I watch the series again I realized he wasn't in that many episodes, but I really like the guy. It's later in the series, but there's one time when Batman has him cornered and he asks ""Who are you?"" and Terri responds ""I'll give you a hint, you killed my father.""  The bad guy then responds, ""You have no idea how little that helps.""

#2: you get 4 episodes, eachone is about 25mins or so long, they are awesome, they introduce you to new villians and old villians in a NEW way.

This DVD is one of my favorites, even though I know the story of Batman Beyond almost word for word, I just can't get enough of it, the music is totally Head Banging to..and you will fall in the love with the characters.. the dialoge is never cheesy. its an action film first and for most, and an animation second.

This is must have for the new generation Batman lovers, screw the WB this is the real thing :D",1151020800,6,950,3.9842105263157896
1260921,4,B0000399WG,"Great DVD!  Starts off the Batman Beyond series.  The stories are interesting and though the style animation is not exactly new, but has the new and unique intersting twist of being staged in the future.  They have done a great job with it.

ONE WARNING!!!  If you want season one do not buy this!  There are 13 episodes on season one and this DVD has 6 of them!  This would get 5 stars if you were not able to get all of them on the season one DVD.  I felt just a little ripped off.",1146787200,38,483,4.010526315789473
1260922,5,B0000399WG,"In this future version of Gotham City, Bruce Wayne is an old man, long retired from being BatMan. Dick Grayson's fate is unknown (though its hinted in this series that he still lives), Babara Gordon is now the police Commissoner, her father James Gordon has passed on as has Alfred. Tim Drake, the second Robin, is AWOL (though we learn his fate later in BatMan Beyond: Return Of The Joker).

In a twist of fate, Terry McGinnes becomes the new Dark Knight with a reluctant Bruce Wayne as his mentor. This DVD features the premiere of this series as well as 4 additional episodes from the series.

BATMAN BEYOND (Pilot) - Bruce Wayne has been retired from being BatMan for over 20 years. In that time, his family company was bought out by crooked businessman Dereck Powers and Gotham is not what it once was. When Powers has a worker murdered to cover up one of his crooked dealings, Terry McGuiness (the worker's son) wants justice. Thus, through a series of events, he becomes the new BatMan to take down Powers.

GOLEM - A kid at Terry's high school becomes fed up with being bullied and uses a giant robot called The Golem to take revenge on those that bullied him.

WINNING EDGE - During a robbery, the new Batman discovers that one of the robbers is a kid at his high school. This mystery leads him down a trail that points to one of the original Batman's old enemies......BANE!

DEAD MAN'S HAND - The Royal Flush Gang returns to Gotham to loot and seek revenge on Batman......problem is, one of its members falls for him!

MELTDOWN - Still alive after 50 years, Mr. Freeze is given a new chance at life only to be duped into a dangerous experiment! Seeking revenge, he battles both Batman and a new enemy.....BLIGHT!

This DVD gives you a good introduction into the world of the new Batman as he battles new enemies plus updated versions of the original Batman's old enemies! I'd recommend this along with Batman Beyond: Return Of The Joker!",1125532800,10,1947,4.56160458452722
1260923,5,B0000399WG,"A few years after the end of Batman: The Animated Series, I saw an ad for a new series that featured a new Batman in a future Gotham City.  And, horrors - Bruce Wayne/Batman was an OLD MAN, unrecognizable from the form BTAS fans are accustomed to.  I refused to watch it, thinking it was kind of a travesty.
But when I mentioned my concerns to a friend, he said it was good.  So I checked it out, and am so glad I did.  BB is the continuation of the Dark Knight and the city he protects.  Bruce Wayne has become quite old, and even more stubborn.  Alfred has passed away, so the only companion for the old man is a dog, Ace.  Ace is no ordinary dog.  I happen to remember buying the comic when Ace was re-introduced in the 1990's.  Ace is Wayne's intelligent guardian and helper.  Bruce Wayne is secluded in his manor, all the memoribilia of his crime-fighting days lovingly displayed in the now unused Batcave.  Barbara Gordon, the former Batgirl, is now the aging commissioner of police, taking her father's former position.  The elder Gordon has also passed away.
Enter Terry McGinnis.  A brash, handsome young man with the same black hair and blue eyes as his predecessors, he stumbles upon Wayne and his secret.  Wayne and McGinnis clash, and through a touching series of events and flashbacks, there is a new Batman, with the original Batman at the helm.
Batman Beyond is proof that Batman lives, that his legacy is enduring and what he stands for will last forever, even if he will not.  Criminals will still look up at the night sky and shudder with fear just by hearing his name.",1088553600,14,1588,4.465277777777778
1260924,4,B0000399WG,"Terry McGinnis stumbles upon Bruce Wayne's secret, that he was once Batman!  McGinnis needs Batman's help, but when Mr. Wayne refuses, Terry has to BECOME Batman himself.  Armed with a advanced flying, super-strong, loaded to the gills with weapons, suit and with the help of Mr. Wayne's knowledge, Terry McGinnis brings to Gotham City what it needs most : The Dark Knight!
I had to take a star away because I don't feel the future Gotham City or the new Batman are as dark or as impressive as Batman:The Animated Series.  Bruce Wayne used smarts as much as devices to get out of the traps set up by them, and the fact he wasn't just a copy of Superman made him even more interesting.  Also, the old fashion evildoers were just better designed.  I mean, THE Joker was ten times better than a room full of Jokers!  And he had better lines.
Still, the DVD has the first movie and four bonus episodes, so it is good value for your money.  The artwork and plots also improved as the series developed, so I will be picking up more DVDs of the new Batman.",1080345600,7,1049,4.404145077720207
1260925,4,B0000399WG,"I enjoyed this alot, purists who like their Batman to be broody, mysterious.. and well, not a teenager with teenage problems... you may not enjoy this. The Batman Beyond Return of the Joker movie is a film which is simply brilliant, far outshining this one in animation and story.. if you are contemplating one or the other, take that movie instead!",1017360000,2,349,4.737704918032787
1260926,4,B0000399WG,"With FIVE new Batman DVD's being released on April 23, 2002 (including Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker: The Original Cut!) and Justice League quickly becoming the biggest show on Cartoon Network, I thought now would be a fine time to revisit Batman Beyond: The Movie.
I remember the night when 'Rebirth' (aka BB: The Movie)premired. I had a history project due the next day, but I made sure to block out an hour to watch the new series. I was definitely NOT disappointed. Unfortunately, the series didn't always live up to the high quality of that first night, or the quality of the shows before it. Fans who have watched all three seasons of Batman Beyond know that while the episodes have been good, only a third of them really harkened back to the spirit of the original series. Most of season 2, for example, was wasted with teen angst plots (a tough love boarding school, a psychotic robotic girlfriend) underdeveloped villains (a father is laid off, builds a power suit and turns to crime, a terrorist organization with a new ripped from GI Joe), and the character Max, the annoying sidekick who more often than not robbed Terry of character development by doing things for him. Granted, the episodes were always fun to watch, but they never really had the emotional and intellectual impact Batman: TAS was famous for. On the plus side of things, most of the episodes in the 1st season were excellent, and this DVD manages to deliver six of those.
BB: The Movie starts out with an intro that manages to develop the original Batman (Bruce Wayne), and set up why he gave up the cowl. It's a breathtaking opening, and features the new Batsuit in a not-quite futuristic world. The story then moves on to introduce Terry, the new Batman, his chance meeting with Wayne, and his motivations for donning the suit. There are lots of classic moments in this two-parter: Bruce beats off a gang of Jokerz, smirking at their attempts to imitate the original clown prince of crime; Terry banging on the gates to Wayne Manor, demanding for Bruce to let him in because he has vital info concerning a viral plague; Bruce and Terry talking about the death of Bruce's parents and how Terry's situation is similiar. All in all, a nice self-contained movie that sets up the characters and villains well.
The other four bonus episodes on this disc are just as great. One episode is a teen angst episode about a boy and his robot, but it's well done in the way that it focuses more on the boy than Batman, which is how the majority of the villains in the original series were introduced. Another episode has the return of Mr. Freeze (need I say more?). The third episode features a romance similiar to the Batman/Catwoman relationship of the past, and, though melodramatic at times, is fun to watch. The weakest episode is The Winning Edge, which features someone selling Bane's venom formula to kids on the street. The 'say no to drugs message' becomes overly obvious, and the surprise villain isn't really that great. However, six episodes still means two hours of entertainment, which makes it just as long as any feature length film.
I'd give this disc a solid recommendation except for one problem: One of the episodes, Black Out, is missing. Not only was this a fantastic episode, it also ruins the chronological order of the episodes on this DVD (all the episodes are in order, with the omission of Black Out). Because of the new DVD's, petitions have been created to release all Batman Beyond episodes on DVD. This might mean if you buy this disc now, another edition might come out later with the missing episode on it. This is nowhere near definite, but it's something to consider.
Based solely on this disc, not on what special editions the future might bring, I recommend Batman Beyond: The Movie. Great animation, music, and acting make this a must-have.",1010707200,19,3853,4.70962962962963
1260927,2,B0000399WG,"My friend from England once said: Adventure is a TIME not a place. And this aftermath of the phenomenal Batman series of the early 90s is proof. If you're not a fan of the early 90s Batman series, you may like this. But if like me you were a fan of the early 90s Batman series, chances are you are going to be REALLY disappointed by this. I will not simply say: ""Bruce Wayne is Batman."" But here are the problems. Any original Batman fan knows that while Bruce Wayne was ALIVE, he NEVER would have hung up his Batcape while crime was out there. Second, what made the early 90s episodes were the villains like the Joker, the Penguin, the Madhatter, the Scarecrow, and the Riddler. The people who imitate the Joker are quite close to laughable. I am not saying we can not reuse old ideas, and that we can't expand a little on the past. But throwing name on a wonderful old series proves the saying: ""Adventure Is A Time. Not a place."" With the exception of the one good scene where the real Batman saves Terry from a bunch of Joker wannabees, (the only good scene in the moive) Batman is really not given any justice....But what kind of reviewer praises everything he reviews?",996192000,2,1174,4.389908256880734
1260928,4,B0000399WG,"It's certainty been quite a lackluster decade for the Dark Knight of Gotham City with such massively disheartening creative travesties such as the departure of Tim Burton from creative helm ship over the film series, Joel Schumacher's (Batman Forever, Batman and Robin) misfortunately offensive one-dimensional cheapening of the entire Batman film franchise, the shamefully overly embellished stereotypical performances of Uma Thurman (holy horny Chlorophyll Batman), Arnold Schwarzenegger  (Oozing with frozen ham in every bite!), Tommy Lee Jones (Golden Raspberry quality for both performances), and Jim Carrey (Please give him some Valium!), Batman having been contradictory played by a different person in virtually every sequel (Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, George Clooney), the notable absence of a Knightfall film adaptation, and Kurt Russell being recommended as the next Batman might have suggested that Batman had finally been dealt a destructive fatal blow by an uncreative excessively formulistic Hollywood machine.
Thankfully however, Batman only required a timely and compelling revitalization of the Caped Crusader's mythos, atmospheric landscape, criminal adversaries, psychological complexities, and thematic significance as a crime fighter. All of which and substantially more were provided amply in Warner's Brother's new animated motion picture Batman Beyond: The Movie. Bitingly refreshing in its sheer story-telling audacity, Batman Beyond: The Movie chronicles the untimely retirement of Bruce Wayne as Batman after Wayne's physical prowess seriously fails him for the first time in his illustrious career after a botched kidnapping rescue attempt forces the once physically immaculate crime fighter to threaten a condescending hoodlum at gunpoint. Twenty years later, Gotham City had become profusely submerged into a searing plague of rampant youth crime, beleaguered by widespread fraudulent corporate treachery, and ultimately had deteriorated into a grotesquely dynamic breeding hotbed for countless hordes of technology competent super villains and physically aggressive social outcasts.
Purposely isolated and outlandishly secluded from the world he previously protected, Bruce Wayne steadfastly monitors world events in his lavishly dilapidated mansion ominously overlooking the Fritz Lang-eque metropolis below. Until one day, when a young impetuously irresponsible young man, Terry McGinnis, toting a similarly tragic past unintentionally unearths the nocturnal skeletons in Wayne's rather substantial closet. After numerous innovative progressive narrative twists, Terry assumes the Batman mantle and endeavors to bring law and order back upon Gotham once again.
Displaying a dash of Orwell's 1984, a minuscule aroma of Terry Gilliam's Brazil, and some of the visual bravado from Ridley Scott's Blade  Runner, Batman Beyond: The Movie represents quite a considerable narrative evolution for the animated motion picture. Enveloping the viewer with a massively intoxicating animated parable of Paradise Lost translated to comic book proportions, Batman Beyond: The Movie remains a vigorously gripping comic caper inordinately graced with uncommonly diverse characterizations, keenly perceptive sociological insights, profusely diabolical plot twists, and an inordinately gripping comprehension of it's source materials. I for one was extensively flabbergasted by the film's deft integration of the classic Batman motifs immersed with the sci-fi based innovations of the Batman Beyond's present storyline. Though hindered slightly by the pitfalls of having a teenage protagonist storyline crossbreed with the gargantuan Batman canvas, Batman Beyond atypically represents the definite potential of sharply conceived and breathlessly executed action animation. A sheer pleasure for anyone who likens themselves a Batman fan.
As for the film's DVD features, Batman Beyond: The Movies also contains four other Batman Beyond episodes and the film's theatrical trailer for your viewing pleasure. A Definitive Must for any fan highly sophisticated animation.
P.S. Substantial kudos should go to the Warner Brothers Animation Department for single-handedly reaffirming and redeeming the Batman legend for an entire new generation of prospective fans everywhere.",993081600,6,4283,6.148580968280467
1260929,4,B0000399WG,"Today, I finally recieved and watched the uneditted version of the movie in question... which deserves five stars, but lost one in my book for lack of artistical freedom. The uneditted AVI runs at 270+ MB, has the usual screen messages from time to time (""Not for sale. If you rented this tape, please call 1800 NOCOPY"") and Japanese subtitles put on by whoever digitized it (They're over the screen warnings) but these are minor annoyances which are quickly ajusted to.
I saw the two things I wanted to see: 1) Terry holding his own with out the fancy new batsuit 2) A transition into a more detective form of the dark knight again
The end, when Terry is standing on a rooftop like the classic batman did, and they play TAS theme (in an electric guitar form) it's just so powerful... I half-expected him to pull out the hook-gun or the bat-a-rang, and catch it on some flagpole, and glide into the darkness.
An exellent film which will make a welcome addition to my DVD collection if or when it is released in it's original form. For now, I'm thinking of converting the AVI to a VCD format and burning it on a CD-R as a temporary solution:).",976492800,2,1142,4.4688995215311005
1260930,5,B0000399WG,"It is truly unfortunate that the animated film is considered ""fodder"" for children in this country.  In Europe and Japan animation is given the respect that it so richly deserves.  The writers and artists struggle long and hard to produce quality stories and they are entitled to some recognition.
The genre is no better served than in this latest in the continuing saga of one Bruce Wayne, AKA Batman.  To place the character as an elderly man who finds a worthy successor in the form of student Terry McGinnis was truly genius at work.
The film has its share of violence that is essential to plot development.  Persons who feel that the violence is inappropriate for children need to know that this is not a film designed solely for small fry.  It is a movie for anyone who has ever thumbed through the pages of the comic book or sat in the theater watching the exploits of ""THE DARK KNIGHT.""
As was in the case of the other Batman series, Kevin Conroy provides the voice of the mature Bruce Wayne; Will Friedle provides the right vocal balance between student and ""superhero.""
Rumor has it that the ""Batman Beyond - Return of the Joker"" is being edited to ""tone down the violent content.""  If this is true, then one might want to buy ""Batman Beyond - The Movie"" before it is recalled and receives a hatchet job.",971568000,32,1314,4.546610169491525

7916976,4,B0000399WG,"The main characters are Bruce Wayne, Terry McGinnis,,Derek Powers, and Mr Fixx

The beginning has Bruce in his Final Bat Suit.  It was all black with a Red Bat Emblem on it's chest.  The suit had strength enhancement and electronic sensors built in.  It clearly served as body armor.  Finally it had flight capacity -  thrusters were built into the feet and Bat like Wings appeared during flight.

The main movie takes place decades after Bruce had retired.  He was no longer Batman and his company had been taken over Derek Powers - creating Wayne Powers Inc.

Derek was a Lex Luther type villain. His right hand man was a brute named Mr. Fixx.  Fixx was hired muscle, an assassin, and general mercenary.  Powers used the corporation as an empire and performed various illegal and immoral acts for profit.  The worst was producing a gas that was both mutagenic and flesh eating.

Terry was a 17 year old.  Some minor Juvenile offensives, but a decent and strong teen.  While fleeing an attack from a Gang, that idolized the Joker, he met Bruce.  Even as a senior citizen a street gang wasn't a match for Bruce.  By fate or accident Terry quickly found The Bat Cave.

Terry's Dad worked at Wayne Powers.  When he learned about the gas, Powers had Fixx kill him.  That started a chain reaction.  Causing Terry to bring evidence of the gas to  Bruce.  Then it getting stolen.  Then Terry sneaking into the cave and swiping the Bat Suit.  Him confronting Powers and Fixx.  Powers being exposed to the gas.  Fixx crashing the cargo plain full of the gas, apparently dying in the process.

The epilogue was two part:

1)  Terry officially became Bruce's assistant.  Unofficially was training with Bruce.  Bruce willing passed the mantle of Batman to Terry.

2)  Extreme radiation treatments save Powers from the gas.  But the radiation interacted with the mutational properties of the gas.  Powers's entire flesh became a transparent glowing green, leaving a black outline of skeleton visible.  Even physical darkness could no longer conceal Derek Powers evil.  Looking at his new form, Powers let out the maniacal laughter of one who'd just been reborn a Monster.",1482019200,,2159,4.797814207650274
