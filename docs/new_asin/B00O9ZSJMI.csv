6729593,5,B00O9ZSJMI,"I had the opportunity 20 years ago to travel to China on a tour that included a visit to the province of Xian where the underground mausoleum of life-size terra-cotta warriors was discovered in 1974 by some farmers. I was so excited about the visit then that I took lots of photos as we were hurriedly taken through the one (of three) tombs that was  at that time = partially excavated  that I really didn't learn much of how they got there, who crafted them and how long the project took. Since my visit both Chinese and British archeologists have spent years, using computer technology to learn lots more.  The summary of their findings is explored in the 53 minute episode of NOVA which is on this DVD. It is  in a word  fascinating.  The three tombs (only one is is being excavated now  were built to surround Chinas first emperor, Qin Shi Huang Di (for whom China is named)  who ruled over 2200 years ago! Many of the clay soldiers (there were 8,000 of them!) still remain though some have lost their heads or arms. Many of them carried spears and cross bows and  though time  the wood decomposed. But the metal parts of these weapons did not decomposer and scientists were able to analyze them. They ares used the precise locations where the arrow and spear heads were found to determine how small groups worked for what is estimated to be 40 years to craft the soldiers and the weapons.

This Nova production was co=produced by the British Channel Four TV network and includes some recreations to show what the live army might have looked like. I couldn't find any credits for these recreation battle scenes but that are of the quality you would find in a major motion picture. They are quite realistic with a cast of at least hundreds.

I cant recommend this highly enough for anyone interested in Chinese history or anyone who has seen the warriors in person. But anyone interested in craftsmanship will find this film a must see.

There are no bonus features on the DVD.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

With this movie it gave me the history of how they were made and all the work that the slaves put into it, they were some artist with so much work. It is a history of China, an art, and beautiful work that the slaveries left behind. Besides the intent, I just call it a beautiful art.",1482192000,,367,4.111111111111111

8682773,5,B00O9ZSJMI,"In 2013, I had the joy of seeing the traveling exhibit ""China's Terracotta Warriors"".  A year later, Nova produced this hour-long episode on the 1st emperor's burial complex. PBS crammed a lot of great information into this show.

First, it gives an abbreviated history of Qin Shi Huang, himself, pronounced chin shuh wahng. His name and dynasty  he took the throne in 246 B.C.E. - gave their name to the country of China. His home territory was in what is now north-west China. He conquered the lands to his East and South.

When he died, he went back to his homeland to be buried. As the narrator tells us, the terra cotta army is located a mile east of his tomb mound: ""It stands guard between the emperor's grave and the states he subjugated to the East.""

Commentators include Xiuzhen (Janice) Li (from the Terracotta Museum, China - TCA), Cao Wei (TCA), Marcos Martinon-Torres (University College London  UCL), Jonathan Clements (historian), Andrew Bevan (UCL), Mike Loades (military historian) and Andy Lacey (master metal forger).

These participants show us how the terracotta figures were hand-manufactured and assembled. We learn how Qin was a tyrant known for cruelty: ""Perfection was achieved through fear."" They analyze and recreate the state-of-the-art bronze weapons the ghost army held. As Torre says: ""These are freshly made weapons delivered directly to the Terracotta Army. I think it's obvious these are not representations for religious purposes. These are real lethal weapons made to kill."" Quin had amazing wealth to be able to ""waste"" so many real weapons by burying them in a tomb.

Now that so much work has been done on the figures in the pits, it's easy to forget the mess that was uncovered four decades ago. The figures had initially stood in an open space under wooden roofs covered by soil. After 2,000 years, though, dirt had totally infiltrated and covered everything. Anything made of wood rotted away  though sometimes you can still see the imprint of the wood.

The story of the Terracotta Army is fascinating, and not yet over. I very much enjoyed this TV show.

The museum exhibit I mention at the beginning was accompanied by a museum catalog that is so well-produced it almost qualifies as a history book. It is chock full of gorgeous photos:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/China-s-Terracotta-Warriors-The-First-Emperor-s-Legacy/dp/0980048494/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">China's Terracotta Warriors: The First Emperor's Legacy</a>
