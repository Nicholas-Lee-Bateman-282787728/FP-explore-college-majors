8328005,5,B001NWAAB8,"Wonderful footage, my father was stationed at Deopham Green and my mother was a local from Attleborough. I was surprised to find this and glad I did. Thank you to whoever put this together.",1449705600,,189,4.588235294117647
8328006,4,B001NWAAB8,This DVD was more of two people's stories and memories when they were at Deopham Green.  My father flew from there in the early months of 1944.  It gives a good insight of what the training was and how life was there.  I would recommend this book for anyone who is interested in Deopham Green or the war in the European theater.,1379635200,,328,4.258064516129032
