1711288,5,B000066733,"On this tape, Gohan comes down from Supreme Kai's planet to fight Buu. Gohan quickly gets the upper hand of the fight, until Buu self-destructs. Majin Buu heals himself, and challenges Gotenks instead of Gohan for a fight. Goten and Trunks re-fuse, and Buu absorbs Gotenks and Piccolo for an ultimate fight!! This is a definate buy for any DBZ fan!",1022284800,,348,4.721311475409836

7961658,5,B000066733,"I am glad to see that the 4:3 or original version of DBZ is still sold.
Here the english voices are not re-dubbed ( they re-dubbed the voices of majin buu in the orange brick version which is cropped, etc), and the disc offers the original japanese cast.",1392940800,,254,4.3125
7961659,5,B000066733,"After Gotenks' fusion unravels, things look bad. Gohan shows up at the last minute to save the day. He has been receiving training from the Kai's, and he's far stronger than Buu now. Buu can't stand this powerless feeling. He is able to absorb Piccolo and Gotenks. Doing this gives him even more power than before.",1355702400,,314,4.625
7961660,5,B000066733,In these sagas you get to see some real action.  The beginning is awesome though the other parts aren't.  It's really cool when Gohan does his backfist and with all the slow moo this is an episode to buy.  There is also 10 minutes of porno in the last 3 minutes,1116201600,,261,4.078431372549019

7961662,4,B000066733,"this one is rather clichee because there is always someone coming to save the day. if not Goku its Gohan. this time its Gohan. His hidden powers have been awaken, he is now Mystic Gohan. to everyone's surprise, Buu was already aware that Gohan was coming due to the fact that Buu can now sense Kai Energies. Gohan still proves that he is the strongest. Realizing this, buu self destructs to buy time so that he can get the opportunity to obsorb the fused trunks and goten as well as picolo. when Buu obsorbs the two, he transforms into super Buu, its trouble for Gohan because he has to deal with the mind of Piccolo, the strength and tricks of Gotenks, and the indestructable body of Buu!",1038441600,5,689,4.433070866141732
7961663,3,B000066733,"This one was typically frustrating--Gohan SHOULD have creamed Buu, but didn't(same old story on DBZ). I watch in English with the Japanese subtitles running to compare the differences & I have to say I liked some of the English lines better--Funimation pushed the head games much more than the original Japanese subtitles indicate--Piccolo WOULD use psych games on Gohan very effectively. One could hear Piccolo in the lines--forget that Goten & Trunks, being fused, wouldn't be having individual thougts, but Gohan doesn't know that--the audience saw that back at Kami's place.",1029628800,,578,5.362637362637362
