They make each series very clear, they go deep into it, and don't skip anything. They put all of the facts in front of you, and then explain to us, what did go wrong to cause these shocking disasters. The title SECONDS FROM DISASTERS sounds like near misses. But it is not. Its a full impact. Many may remember a terrible train disaster in Austria, a special train was takeing skiers up to the slopes. But going through the Tunnel, a fire was discoverd on the train, then the train suddenly came to an unexpected halt. Most of the passengers on the train were unaware of the fire, 150 people perished inside that Tunnel.  THIS IS A 6 DISC DVD SET. I will give you the names of the titles.  CRASH OF THE CONCORED......FIRE ON THE STAR......INFERNO AT GUADALAJARA......MELTDOWN at CHERNOBYL......TUNNEL INFERNO......COLLISION ON THE RUNWAY......AMSTERDAM AIR CRASH......FIRE ON THE SKI SLOPE......GARE DE LYON CRASH......PENTAGON 9-11......WRECK OF THE SUNSET LTD......BALI BOMBING.
