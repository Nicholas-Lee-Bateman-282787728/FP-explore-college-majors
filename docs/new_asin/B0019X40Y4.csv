8275534,1,B0019X40Y4,"Ok, I've purchased tons of reggae dvds and cds here on Amazon.com, and I've come to realize that there will always be a few that really should have never been released - and this is the king of them all. The sound quality is absoutely atrocious - overmodulated screaming like some angry teen working at Burger King, yelling over the speaker when all you want is a whopper, fries and a coke. I took a chance and bought this because I love George Nooks, Tarrus Riley, Wayne Wonder and Cocoa Tea...but most of the other ""stars"" I've never heard of - not to mention the fact that their names are misspelled on the cover, which I thought was actually kinda funny. This was definitely a mistake, and now I know not to bother purchasing any of the other dvds in this series. Trust me, spend that money somewhere else...or you'll be very, very sorry.",1225238400,,842,4.474025974025974
