3122313,5,B00144IMHO,"I practice Martial Arts and I had a hip tendon that was always inflamed and the pain would prevent me standing straight up after sitting for brief periods of time.  The techniques on this dvd were easy to follow/to do and after a few weeks, I noticed the pain was almost gone.  Now, not only am I pain free, I know how to avoid it in the future and my flexibility improved!  Jill Miller's work is revolutionary and applies to everyone.  If you want healthy joints and muscles, you need this dvd!!",1209686400,37,496,4.358695652173913

3122320,1,B00144IMHO,"This is not for the beginner at all.  I am a runner and cycle, I don't bend like a pretzel.  There was not even an option for modified.  Wasted of money for me.",1432080000,2,160,3.787878787878788
3122321,5,B00144IMHO,"I have practiced and taught yoga for 11 and 9 years (respectively), and this is one of my go-to practices at home. It was a godsend when I had an SI [sacroiliac] issue and then a hamstring attachment strain early on. It's about an hour practice that is a combination of strength and stretch training. I noticed a huge, immediate difference in the reduction of chronic pain/muscle spasms and also improvement in my yoga practice. If you're expecting a flow practice, though, this video does not offer it. Jill Miller jumps around from seated to standing and from one prop to the other. Her teaching style is reminiscent of Iyengar yoga, both in her very specific instructions and also the sequencing, although the exercises pull from not only yoga but other traditions as well. Her style is no-nonsense and instructive, but there is no overt focus on the meditative aspects of a body-mind practice--her focus is entirely on the physical realm. Once you're familiar with the video, it's easy to follow along, but it requires multiple props, and she jumps around from prop to prop so that sometimes you have to pause the video to get it all together. It's all worth it for the way my hips feel at the end.",1422057600,2,1202,4.6745283018867925

3122323,5,B00144IMHO,"I recently began martial arts again after 27 years of not doing it.  Upon restarting, I rapidly discovered that my hips are no longer the loosey-goosey things that they were when I was 16!  Side kicks hurt, axe kicks hurt, back kicks hurt, even sit-ups kill my hip flexors and psoas muscles.  My hips clearly need stretching and strengthening, and they need this on an intensive and deep level if I want to improve my martial arts practice.

This practice is the best thing since sliced bread!  Jill Miller works my hips from every angle, focusing heavily on stretching them and even strengthening them.  In working the hip muscles, the lower and mid back muscles and the abdominal muscles are worked as well, which I also appreciate since strengthening my core will also help strengthen and stabilize my kicks.  The practice is not easy, but it's also not as hard to do as it looks.  My hips are fairly tight, and I was able to do all of the things Jill asked.  There were some moves that I clearly need to improve, but I know that with time and practice my hips will be the way that I want them to be.  I just finished the practice and my hips are loose, warm, and I have a greater range of motion than I had before I did the workout.  This was a good investment!",1415923200,2,1265,4.363247863247863

Sure, its not yoga, BUT I find my hip flexibility is getting in the way of my yoga practice advancing. You can count on the safety of this instructor! She has amazing knowledge; but don't let her jargon get in the way. As she thoroughly describes the efforts in the 'workshop' section (prior to the workout where she puts 'em all together) she is addressing the skeptical physical therapist a bit.

3122341,3,B00144IMHO,"My living room is tiny and it's very difficult for me to have to rearrange my furniture to do some of the moves.  For props you will need the following:  2 yoga blocks, a yoga strap, a yoga blanket and she also uses something she calls ""yoga cubes"" which looks like a heavy bookshelf, but she makes it clear that instead you can use a table, bookshelf, or a window ledge and also a wall.  Without this yoga cube you will need BOTH a table or ledge and a wall.  Most people have walls and tables so that's no biggie, but the ledge or window needs to be at a specific height for some of the moves to work properly.  Like there's one move where you put your foot up on the ledge/table and she says that it needs to be paralell to your hip.  Well lets hope your ledge just happens to be at that height then.  Where my tv is in my little living room makes it difficult for me to have access to a wall where I'd still be able to watch the dvd while doing the move.

3122342,5,B00144IMHO,"I developed an injury related bursitis running some months before buying this. I tried cortisone shots, massage, what yoga positions I could find, chiropractic, homeopathy, foam rollers, acupuncture, resting, and still it would not go away. The day before I received the video, after a month of rest, I tried to run - very slow, very easy - and at the end it was apparent the bursitis was still going to be a problem. The next day I got this video, did HALF the workout, and felt great. Ran the next day and experienced only a residual tenderness, and now a week later, I don't even notice anything.

The workout itself is a combination yoga/therapy. There are some great strengtheners, some awesome stretches, and some stuff I can't do, even though I have practiced yoga before. At an hour long, it's not my favorite way to spend my precious workout time, but I'm working it in a couple times a week, and incorporating some of my favorite exercises from it into my daily stretches.

The IT band stretches are fantastic. That's a place us runners always seem to have problems with, and they are so hard to stretch!  If you're a runner with any hip or IT band problems, I highly recommend this!",1382486400,8,1193,4.591549295774648

3122345,2,B00144IMHO,"I generally love Jill Millers work.  However I have a newly diagnosed torn hip labrum and this dvd is waaaay to risky for someone with this kind of injury.  Its a great DVD but if you are injured, please respect your body, seek the advice of a professional and get a program that is tailored to your unique needs.",1374019200,4,313,4.288135593220339
3122346,5,B00144IMHO,"I've been a runner nearly all my life, and as I entered my 30s, starting having nagging injuries that have all been related in some way to my hips (IT band syndrome, runner's knee, ischial bursitis...you name it). This is partly due to the fact that my pelvic bone is rotated slightly ""downward"" so my muscles are constantly imbalanced. I've probably spent thousands of dollars on treatments trying to fix injuries associate with this muscle imbalance: deep tissue massages, Graston (look it up if you haven't heard of it - it's amazing), acupuncture, regular chiropractic adjustments, inserting heel lifts into my shoes to tip my pelvis more forward, physical therapy...I could go on for days.

I started doing yoga as yet another option to try to fix these injuries, really enjoyed it, and became advanced enough to feel comfortable in intermediate vinyasa (aka, flow) classes. However, I've always struggled with some hip opening poses, but not others. For example, I can move easily into pigeon pose and and be in correct alignment, but if I tried to move into cow pose, I could barely get my knees in alignment, let alone keep my sits bones on the floor! I started thinking I needed to do something else besides vinyasa and yin yoga to open up my hips, and bought this DVD after reading the reviews.

I've done this program ONCE and can already notice a difference! For the first time in months, my hip flexors don't feel tight or ache. At the end of this program, my glutes touched my heels while I was in child's pose, something I have NEVER achieved unless someone was pressing on my back.  I was also made of aware of how incredibly weak my adductors are and how much my abductors were compensating for this weakness. I am going to try to do these exercises 3 times a week and see how  I improve.  I can't wait!

A few things you should know about this DVD:
1. You will need two yoga blocks and a yoga strap in addition to your regular mat and towel. I didn't have blocks or a strap, and was able to improve with some old shoe boxes and a towel, but actual blocks and a strap would make it much easier.
2. You will also need access to a wall to do some of the exercises, as well as a table and/or sturdy chair (one that doesn't roll) to do some stretches.
3. Some of the strengthening exercises require the ability to ""slide"" your towel over a tile or wood floor, which can be a problem for those of us who only have carpet and have a microscopic kitchen. Jill says you can adjust for this by putting trash bags under your towel, but that didn't work very well for me. However, there are only 2 or 3 exercises that require sliding, so I will just look for an alternative.
4. The main ""program"" is approximately 60 minutes in duration, but a good portion of this is Jill Miller explaining the poses and guiding you through the routine. I think I will be able to do all of the stretches/poses/exercises in about 30-40 minutes (depending on how long each position is held) once I am more familiar with the program.
5. There is an introduction section as well as several ""shorter"" segments that focus on balance poses and breathing.

Can't wait to see how much I can improve my yoga practice as well as my running with this routine!",1373414400,2,3237,4.476271186440678
3122347,5,B00144IMHO,"Some back ground to contextualize my review:  I have danced professionally on and off for 30 years (retired from serious dance in 1992 after 2 knee surgeries), studied Pilates with a genius, later got certified to teach, taught full force full-contact self defense for 12 years, in depth practices of both kundalini and vinyasa styles of yoga for 30 years +/-. ETC.  So in addition to pretty consistent troubles from my knee, I have a diastasis  (a split of the rectus abdominus; something like a hernia) from 2 pregnancies at "" an advanced age"", which have caused, sometimes, debilitating back and leg pain.

SOOOO; Jill MIller's Hip Helpers video did more for my hip, back and knee mobility and ease than I had in years! After one particular exercise, THE FIRST TIME I TRIED IT, I had release in my lumbar spine that I have not had in YEARS!  I did these simple exercises, some of which are derived from yoga, some have a more PT reference, every other day...not even every exercise each time and my knee is better than it's been in years!

I have spent so much time and money and worry trying to solve the puzzle of my particular body. And these exercises have been the missing piece of the rehab puzzle.

All have enabled me to go back to a full yoga practice, play soccer with my kids, sleep better and most importantly feel more comfort and  OPTIMISM about the process of aging.

3122348,2,B00144IMHO,"There should be some disclaimers that indicate that these postures are not appropriate for real hip problems. My doctor, while recommending other exercises deemed these too extreme. They would probably be fine for experienced yoga practitioners with no medical issues who want to further increase hip flexibility.",1366243200,4,313,5.680851063829787
3122359,5,B00144IMHO,This is by far the best hip video I've had.  It's too soon for me to give any results but I'm certain I will be feeling better very soon.  I love it!,1364428800,,149,3.625
3122360,5,B00144IMHO,"I had knee surgery (orthoscopic) recently because I lost most of my cartiledge (old age sucks).  My Physical Therapist noticed that my hips were extremely inflexible and surmised that much of my knee problems probably came from this.  She noted that I needed to use my hips so my knees weren't overcompensating and taking all of the brunt of jumps, running, etc.  I tried different workouts on DVD and this one sounded really good...so I took a risk and bought it.

I was (and am) very happy with the reward for the risk.  Miller explains each stretch/exercise in (mostly) plain English so I could understand how to do it properly.  I've never felt such deep stretches (anywhere) in my hips before.  Here are few hints for how I got the most out of it.

I would jump straight to the ""Hip Practice"" and watch it first to see what each exercise is.  If you want more detail on a specific stretch, then go to the Hip Workshop (the Hip Workshop explains in detail).  While the DVD doesn't have ""chapters"" for each stretch (this would be nice for jumping to favorites), if you use the Fast Forward on your player, you can skip a stretch - which was nice.  There were at least two that I couldn't do because I didn't have the ""equipment"" needed.

I've seen other reviews that say this isn't really ""yoga"" and that she doesn't focus on breathing like yoga normally does.  I don't know what these reviewers were talking about.  I watched the into in which she talked about her extensive experience with yoga and how she is incorporating different styles and knowledge.  I take a yoga class weekly and I found I learned more about breathing techniques from this DVD than I have after a year of class.  She has a section on Breathing (15 mins) which I recommend.

All in all, I LOVE this DVD.  I do it daily now.  And the results have been astounding.  I'm still rehabbing my knee and the work my Physical Therapist had done with me was great...and was getting me back on the courts...BUT.  After doing this workout (actually only 30 mins of the 58), I played for the first time pain free.  I felt stronger overall.  This combined with improvements to my posture and the PT has done wonders.

I'm looking forward to trying out her knee rehab DVD next.  I also plan on buying this DVD as a gift for others.",1364169600,4,2295,4.472289156626506

3122363,5,B00144IMHO,"I purchased this DVD about 2 1/2 months ago and I am extremely pleased with Jill Miller's program. I read other reviews prior to purchase and can agree with all that is written about this video.

1. It works!
2. It's grueling...but worth it.
3. Jill Miller is right when she stated that hips take a long time to heal.
4. Some of the exercises are difficult to perform but it gets easier as your hips gain flexibility.
5. To get the most from this DVD it is important to watch the whole thing and treat it as a learning experience.
6. The breathing primer really helps with your practice of the exercises.

I am an avid runner and bike rider who was diagnosed with bilateral trochanteric bursitis about 1 year ago. Following the advice of my Orthopedic physician I received injectons in both hips and was told to rest until it felt better. Well that never happened. Accupuncture helped but only so much. After speaking with a Physical Therapist who said I needed to stretch my IT Band and Psoas muscles I knew I needed to do this on my own. I am very grateful that I found this DVD and that Jill Miller presents herself as experienced, truthful, and helpful to those who have purchased her DVD.

2 1/2 months ago I was not able to walk without pain. Currently I am walking and biking without pain. I continue to stretch with Jill Miller on her DVD and am finding that as my hips gain flexibility the stretches on her DVD become easier to do.",1341446400,9,1440,4.385767790262173
3122364,5,B00144IMHO,"I'm in my early thirties and have had minor to very annoying pain (causing a slight limp) in my left hip for 2 years due to a minor fall.  I bought Jill's DVD based on the reviews and am so glad I did. I could immediately feel the weak areas in my hip on day 1. After only a few days I could feel those areas strengthening. Now the areas feel wonderfully stretched and excercised - It's amazing how targeted each pose is! Two of the stretches feel too strenuous for my groin & knees so I replace with more gentle stretches for those areas, but everything else was 100% worth trying something new to help your self conquer your pain!",1323475200,6,632,4.223140495867769
3122365,5,B00144IMHO,"I read all of the reviews before buying this DVD, and I'd like to address the one 1 star review as well as add other comments that may help those of you who are ready to really work to improve your hip flexibility and/or reduce pain.  Although I love this DVD, I can relate to what the 1 star reviewer said.  ""Hip Helpers"" is not really a yoga routine, and Jill Miller alludes to that.  She mentions that these exercises will make your yoga sessions better, although I think the Hip Helpers routine is great all on its own.

The 1 star reviewer also mentioned that this DVD feels much like physical therapy.  I agree somewhat, although I think the format and setting are much nicer than any PT I've done.  To me, it feels more like yoga but without the focus on breath (which is a huge part of any true yoga practice).

Another reviewer commented that the practice gets grueling in the abductor series.  I agree, but that's because I have weak abductors and desperately need to strengthen them to loosen up my adductors!  I would bet that a person with flexible, supple hips can do those exercises with ease.

Anyone looking to really loosen up his/her hips needs to understand the principles of agonist and antagonist muscles.  It's actually easy to understand in spite of the fancy names (and you can learn much more by searching the web using those keywords).  The principle is similar to the ""equal but opposite force"" idea from Newton's Third Law of Motion.  The large muscles that are part of the pelvic girdle are categorized into groups based on their functions (flexing or extending the hip, adducting or abducting the legs, etc.)  As an example, when the hip abductors are weak, other muscles in the hip will work much harder to compensate.  That leads to chronic tightness and shortening in the compensating muscles, while the weak muscles stretch too much.  This sets up a vicious cycle, and stretching the chronically tight muscles will only help slightly.  The only thing that will really work is to figure out which muscles are weak and strenghthen those.

When your muscles are balanced (i.e. you have no weak agonist hip muscles and no overcompensating, tight antagonist muscles), you'll have supple hips and much greater range of motion as well as more power from your leg muscles.  You'll also transfer 'load' (your body weight) from muscles onto your skeleton, where it belongs.  Your bones are meant to bear your weight, not your muscles, tendons, and ligaments.  By balancing your muscles, you can avoid a lot of chronic conditions as you age and you'll feel a lot better.

That's a long-winded explanation, but I thought it might help those of you like me who sit way too much and sleep in a semi-fetal position (both of which can cause tight hip flexors).  People seem to think stretching is the answer to tight hips, but that's only a small part of the answer.  The Hip Helpers DVD really does work if you do it regularly.  Just don't expect overnight results.  It took a long time for you to get tight hips, and our sedentary lifestyles keep adding to our hip muscle imbalances.

Of all the things I've tried, I think this DVD is the most effective single way to balance the hips and make them supple.  I also like Jill's personable manner and the DVD's production values.  The studio she's in is well lit and serene.  You do have to use some props, but remember it's going to take some effort to get your hips realigned and in balance.  BTW, anyone with tight hips should always use props in yoga anyway; you should be able to truly RELAX into the stretches without 'guarding' your muscles against overstretching.  Tight-hipped yogis should sit on a folded blanket or other prop that lifts your hips above the level of your knees when you're sitting cross-legged.  If you don't, your spine will be in the wrong position, and you'll get uncomfortable and fatigue quickly.",1302307200,123,3897,4.675477239353891
3122366,5,B00144IMHO,"I am a marathon runner suffering from tight hips on long runs.  This DVD was recommended by a yoga teacher friend, and the exercises/poses shown have been great for relieving my hip tightness and strain on 18+ mile runs.  Well worth it.",1297209600,8,236,4.595238095238095
3122367,5,B00144IMHO,"The DVD is already helping my hip and back, and I've only done it a couple of times.  I love how she has a workshop prior to the session so you have a better understanding of the correct way to do or modify the moves, and also how she explains the names of the muscles involved.  I've found it helps me focus on the problem areas much better.  If you are new to yoga, take care not to strain yourself as some of the poses are challenging.  I've been doing yoga for 2 years in a studio, but I can usually only get there once a week.  This a wonderful addition to do at home for a daily practice, and I expect to use all three in the series for quite some time.",1294099200,,659,3.924812030075188
3122368,4,B00144IMHO,"This DVD is part of the Yoga Link series offered by Pranamaya. The instructor for this series is Jill Miller, who had previously created her own self-produced video series called Yoga Tune Up. This series from Pranamaya (which also includes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-Link-Shoulder-Shape-Up-with-Jill-Miller/dp/B00144IMHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga Link: Shoulder Shape-Up with Jill Miller</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-Link-Core-Integration/dp/B00144IMHE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga Link: Core Integration</a>) incorporates many aspects of Miller's prior work but adds excellent production values plus a variety of additional workout and DVD options. For starters, there are two main aspects to this DVD, the Hips Workshop, in which Miller uses live instruction to break down the individual moves in great detail, and the Hips Practice, where Miller presents the same exercises via voiceover for a more flowing experience. Also included is a 16-minute Breath Primer: this same segment appears on all three of the DVDs in the Yoga Link series, and it offers an opportunity to obtain detailed instruction on the types of pranayama, or yogic breathing, which Miller utilizes in these practices. Miller uses various props throughout this DVD, including a yoga mat, 2 blocks, a strap, a wall, and a chair/other ledge. There are also several segments in which she glides along her smooth wood floor on a blanket; if you have carpet instead of flooring at home, Miller suggests substituting a trash bag, but I found that this didn't work very well.

The Hip Workshop includes a 60-minute instructional session, 7 minutes of Hip ""Extras,"" and 16 minutes of Advanced Asymmetrical Standing Poses. The workshop itself focuses on the six basic directions of movement for the hips (a brief primer on this precludes the workshop). The Workshop chapters are broken down into Hip Warm Ups, Flexion/Extension, Internal/External Rotation 1, Adduction/Abduction, and Internal/External Rotation 2. Starting immediately with the long Warm Ups sequence, Miller brings fire and heat to the muscles of the entire lower body with Monk Walks, or static lunges; additional warm-up moves offer variations on lunges and hip circles. The leg stretches which follow are performed lying on the floor, and then Miller leads the viewer through a pelvic series which includes a slow cycle of Kapalabhati breathing.  Upon completion of the Warm Ups, Miller returns to standing for the more targeted stretching work. Some of these moves are more traditional, such as lunges, but Miller often adds unique variations, such as an asymmetrical element (e.g., placing one foot on a block or a chair). Then it's back to the floor for more rotational movements. The final sequence of Internal and External Rotation includes many types of rolling motions for the hips in both standing and lying positions. The two chapters found in the Extras segment, ""Sitting Seiza"" and ""Ankle Churning,"" focus on stretching mainly the ankles and toes in a seated position.

As mentioned previously, the 58-minute Hips Helper practice offers all of the same exercises that are in the workshop, but here Miller is instructing via voiceover for a more flowing routine. Also, she sets aside time to rest in savasana at the end of the practice (although she encourages practicing savasana at the end of the workshop as well). The Advanced Asymmetrical Standing Poses, part of the Workshop section, can be performed after either the workshop or the practice. In this 16-minute series, Miller teaches some tricks for working on warrior 2, side flank pose, and reverse side flank, using the blocks and the wall to demonstrate how to go more deeply into these postures.

The main goal of these hip exercises is to mobilize the hips from every angle, and Miller certainly achieves this objective (your muscles will no doubt achingly bear witness to this fact). Overall, Miller's advanced knowledge of anatomy and human movement shines through her teaching, and her easygoing, down-to-earth style allows her to connect with the viewer in a straightforward manner. Although the DVD case rates the intended audience for this practice as ""beginners to teachers,"" I think that those new to yoga are likely to be intimidated by the level of flexibility and endurance demanded by this practice. As an intermediate yogi myself, I find many of the exercises quite strenuous and grueling.  However, those looking to open their hips from every possible angle can't go wrong with this DVD.",1292544000,,4634,5.548797736916549
3122369,4,B00144IMHO,Really great product. I lucked out with this one purchasing it based on just the reviews. I am a martial artist and have Trochantric Bursitis in both of my hips. This video along with a styrofoam roaller has done wonders to stretch all those muscles in my hips and my IT band.,1292025600,8,276,4.326923076923077
3122370,4,B00144IMHO,"Jill Miller's hip, shoulder, and Kneehab DVDs have been good resources for me, in terms of increasing ease and range of motion in those joints. She really knows musculoskeletal anatomy and function, and it shows in her work. Her DVDs are well-done, with clear instruction, nice production values, and a down-to-earth approach. There are some nice extras included here besides the actual workout, and the workshop gives some good pointers for going more deeply into some standing poses. This isn't a routine that I savor the way I do others, but it works and is worth it.

I initially gave this DVD a 5-star review, based on how well-done it is and how thoroughly it works the hips from different angles. After spending a few more months with the DVD, however, I've changed my review to 4 stars. Items 2 & 3 in my list below are why I changed my rating. I'm a huge Jill Miller fan, so for me to dock this a star is kind of a big deal for me.

Some considerations about this Hip Helpers DVD:

1. Despite the title which somewhat confuses things, this DVD is not a demonstration of various yoga asanas. It has a broad selection of hip openers (including some yoga-flavored ones) that help loosen tight hips, and, if desired, prepare one for better performance of asanas that benefit from ease in the hips. If you're looking for a DVD that is all or mostly yoga, this isn't it. If you want help with muscle imbalances and tightness in your hips, this DVD can help you pinpoint and work with those.

2. I have knee issues (PF compartment), and the runner's-lunge-type exercises, as well as the related hip flexor stretches with the front of the foot hanging off of the furniture edge, are out of the question for me. These are very effective stretches, no doubt, but they are unsafe for compromised knees like mine. I feel like they could be especially risky if someone isn't using a piece of very stable furniture that's the proper height for the stretch. Of course, each person is responsible for his/her own safety, but it's all too easy to get into the middle of one of these stretches and then belatedly realize that one's highly flexed knee is the victim of unfavorable forces, especially in those seconds when the knee is hanging and unsupported by the floor.

Though they may not pack as much punch, there are safer versions of these stretches to accommodate my type of problem. Because tight hips can have such a negative impact upon the knees, a well-rounded hip stretching program is important to counteract tight hips, but I believe the DVD would better serve people with knee problems if it came with strong warnings to people with damaged knees about potentially harmful knee movements and recommended modifications in the workshop portion of the DVD.

3. A few of the exercises require a smooth floor (on which to slide a blanket for working adductors, etc.). I mention this so you won't be unpleasantly surprised if you have carpet, like I do. I purchased this DVD before there were reviews mentioning this point. There are other exercise DVDs out there that require a smooth floor, and I've always appreciated it when the product description lists everything that will be needed to do the complete workout, including a smooth floor. The product description for this DVD did not include that info, and it should have. Additionally, the instructor could have suggested alternative movements for carpet-owners within the workshop section of the DVD. In another one of her DVDs, she suggests using garbage bags under a yoga blanket to provide a smooth, slick surface. When using that DVD, I tried this, but it was clumsy and didn't work well for me.

4. This routine is prop-dependent. I use a mat, block, strap, and, for those various movements in which I need to elevate one foot on a piece of furniture, I use two things: a folding chair placed against a wall, and for a higher prop, a bookcase. You could use other types of furniture or props, as long as they're stable.

5. I'd describe my yoga practice as lower-intermediate-level. Although I've had a home practice for several years now, I've always had very tight musculature, and increased flexibility comes very slowly to me. There are some of Miller's hip helpers that I can do in only a very limited way--e.g., where she abducts one leg 90 degrees from the other leg, I can go only a few degrees and inches. But that limited movement, done in a controlled and focused manner, challenges me and works muscles that need to be worked. I'm also balance-challenged, and she integrates a little balance work into some of the movements. Overall, I find her DVDs very challenging, but not intimidating. I've gotten some good ideas from this DVD on how to better work my tight hip muscles.

If you're a beginner, injured, or lacking in flexibility, don't be scared away from Jill's DVDs. She's a wonderful instructor. If you have knee problems, do exercise special care with this one, though. While she is unbelievably (to me) flexible, she seems to endeavor to make her routines accessible and possible for people like me, who haven't yet developed significant physical confidence and flexibility. If you're unsure about whether her work is a good fit for you, check out her website, as well as a sample clip on YouTube from this Hip Helpers DVD.",1286928000,29,5308,4.72972972972973
3122371,5,B00144IMHO,"Jill Miller is brilliant in her ability to use the body to connect to the differnet poses. Her use of anatomy and movement inspires to use all your tools as a teacher. This can help any student of Yoga or teacher better learn and intergrate movements in their own bodies. This hip helpers dvd, really uses tools to aide in understanding how the body moves.",1263168000,4,356,4.492307692307692
3122372,4,B00144IMHO,"This is a pretty challenging routine.  It is the most thorough of any yoga hip routines I have found so far.  If you don't like to use props, you may not like this one.  While I don't have a wall space to do yoga, I was able to effectively do all of the exercises in the video with some sort of temporary solution, except for the ones where she uses a rug on the floor for sliding exercises.  If you have a carpeted floor, you are supposed to use a garbage bag.  This didn't work for me because I kept sliding off the garbage bag.

So, I was frustrated that I couldn't do those exercises effectively.  Even so, I find this program to be very helpful for hip pain/issues.",1263168000,5,670,4.147286821705427
3122373,1,B00144IMHO,"I like yoga and am more flexible than average, but my hips tend to be tight which is why I bought this video. I expected it to be a great yoga routine full of helpful hip poses like pigeon and ankle-to-knee seat. It did not include either one of those basic hip-opening yoga asanas - in fact it didn't really feel like a yoga routine at all. It felt more like doing boring physical therapy. Also you need to have props to do this video, including two blocks, a ledge at about knee height, another ledge about waist height, a hardwood floor, a blanket, and possibly a strap unless you are very flexible in your hips already (in which case, why are you buying this video?). Aside from all this, the video is just dull. I was incredibly disappointed.",1257120000,21,747,4.381294964028777
3122374,4,B00144IMHO,"This DVD is part of the Yoga Link series originally offered by Pranamaya. The instructor for this series is Jill Miller, who had previously created her own self-produced video series called Yoga Tune Up. This series incorporates many aspects of Miller's prior work but adds excellent production values plus a variety of additional workout and DVD options. For starters, there are two main aspects to this DVD, the Hips Workshop, in which Miller uses live instruction to break down the individual moves in great detail, and the Hips Practice, where Miller presents the same exercises via voiceover for a more flowing experience. Also included is a 16-minute Breath Primer: this same segment appears on all three of the DVDs in the Yoga Link series, and it offers an opportunity to obtain detailed instruction on the types of pranayama, or yogic breathing, which Miller utilizes in these practices. Miller uses various props throughout this DVD, including a yoga mat, 2 blocks, a strap, a wall, and a chair/other ledge. There are also several segments in which she glides along her smooth wood floor on a blanket; if you have carpet instead of flooring at home, Miller suggests substituting a trash bag, but I found that this didn't work very well.

The Hip Workshop includes a 60-minute instructional session, 7 minutes of Hip ""Extras,"" and 16 minutes of Advanced Asymmetrical Standing Poses. The workshop itself focuses on the six basic directions of movement for the hips (a brief primer on this precludes the workshop). The Workshop chapters are broken down into Hip Warm Ups, Flexion/Extension, Internal/External Rotation 1, Adduction/Abduction, and Internal/External Rotation 2. Starting immediately with the long Warm Ups sequence, Miller brings fire and heat to the muscles of the entire lower body with Monk Walks, or static lunges; additional warm-up moves offer variations on lunges and hip circles. The leg stretches which follow are performed lying on the floor, and then Miller leads the viewer through a pelvic series which includes a slow cycle of Kapalabhati breathing.

I found the Adduction/Abduction segment to be particularly challenging; this is where Miller uses a blanket to slide on the floor, likely making it very difficult for those practicing on carpet to complete this segment. Notwithstanding the potential practical problems, these movements are quite physically strenuous as well. The final sequence of Internal and External Rotation includes many types of rolling motions for the hips in both standing and lying positions; the blanket is used for sliding again during this series. The two chapters found in the Extras segment, ""Sitting Seiza"" and ""Ankle Churning,"" focus on stretching mainly the ankles and toes in a seated position.  As mentioned previously, the 58-minute Hips Helper practice offers all of the same exercises that are in the workshop, but here Miller is instructing via voiceover for a more flowing routine. Also, she sets aside time to rest in savasana at the end of the practice. The Advanced Asymmetrical Standing Poses, part of the Workshop section, can be performed after either the workshop or the practice. In this 16-minute series, Miller teaches some tricks for working on warrior 2, side flank pose, and reverse side flank, using the blocks and the wall to demonstrate how to go more deeply into these postures.

The main goal of these hip exercises is to mobilize the hips from every angle, and Miller certainly achieves this objective (your muscles will no doubt achingly bear witness to this fact). However, I have to admit that although I love Miller's teaching style and generally have enjoyed all of her DVDs, I did not particularly enjoy this one; rather, I found it to be  quite grueling.  Despite this, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Jill Miller's Yoga Link series in general and this DVD in particular to any experienced yoga practitioners; few other yoga teachers will challenge you to explore your body in such an intense yet accessible manner.",1251504000,22,4019,5.137614678899083

Yoga alone never did that. It has also improved my yoga practice.  I am now an avid Jill Miller fan, and I hope to meet her one day and tell her how much I love her Yoga Link workouts.  I bought all three, and I highly recommend them.  I had searched for so long for stretching workouts before I knew about Yoga Link, only to be bored with standard routines that I ended up not doing.

I noticed a huge, immediate difference in the reduction of chronic pain/muscle spasms and also improvement in my yoga practice. If you're expecting a flow practice, though, this video does not offer it. Jill Miller jumps around from seated to standing and from one prop to the other. Her teaching style is reminiscent of Iyengar yoga, both in her very specific instructions and also the sequencing, although the exercises pull from not only yoga but other traditions as well. Her style is no-nonsense and instructive, but there is no overt focus on the meditative aspects of a body-mind practice--her focus is entirely on the physical realm. Once you're familiar with the video, it's easy to follow along, but it requires multiple props, and she jumps around from prop to prop so that sometimes you have to pause the video to get it all together.

3356820,5,B00144IMHO,"I recently began martial arts again after 27 years of not doing it.  Upon restarting, I rapidly discovered that my hips are no longer the loosey-goosey things that they were when I was 16!  Side kicks hurt, axe kicks hurt, back kicks hurt, even sit-ups kill my hip flexors and psoas muscles.  My hips clearly need stretching and strengthening, and they need this on an intensive and deep level if I want to improve my martial arts practice.

This practice is the best thing since sliced bread!  Jill Miller works my hips from every angle, focusing heavily on stretching them and even strengthening them.  In working the hip muscles, the lower and mid back muscles and the abdominal muscles are worked as well, which I also appreciate since strengthening my core will also help strengthen and stabilize my kicks.  The practice is not easy, but it's also not as hard to do as it looks.  My hips are fairly tight, and I was able to do all of the things Jill asked.  There were some moves that I clearly need to improve, but I know that with time and practice my hips will be the way that I want them to be.  I just finished the practice and my hips are loose, warm, and I have a greater range of motion than I had before I did the workout.  This was a good investment!",1415923200,2,1265,4.363247863247863

Without this yoga cube you will need BOTH a table or ledge and a wall.  Most people have walls and tables so that's no biggie, but the ledge or window needs to be at a specific height for some of the moves to work properly.  Like there's one move where you put your foot up on the ledge/table and she says that it needs to be paralell to your hip.  Well lets hope your ledge just happens to be at that height then.

I tried cortisone shots, massage, what yoga positions I could find, chiropractic, homeopathy, foam rollers, acupuncture, resting, and still it would not go away. The day before I received the video, after a month of rest, I tried to run - very slow, very easy - and at the end it was apparent the bursitis was still going to be a problem. The next day I got this video, did HALF the workout, and felt great. Ran the next day and experienced only a residual tenderness, and now a week later, I don't even notice anything.

The workout itself is a combination yoga/therapy. There are some great strengtheners, some awesome stretches, and some stuff I can't do, even though I have practiced yoga before. At an hour long, it's not my favorite way to spend my precious workout time, but I'm working it in a couple times a week, and incorporating some of my favorite exercises from it into my daily stretches.

3356843,5,B00144IMHO,"I've been a runner nearly all my life, and as I entered my 30s, starting having nagging injuries that have all been related in some way to my hips (IT band syndrome, runner's knee, ischial bursitis...you name it). This is partly due to the fact that my pelvic bone is rotated slightly ""downward"" so my muscles are constantly imbalanced. I've probably spent thousands of dollars on treatments trying to fix injuries associate with this muscle imbalance: deep tissue massages, Graston (look it up if you haven't heard of it - it's amazing), acupuncture, regular chiropractic adjustments, inserting heel lifts into my shoes to tip my pelvis more forward, physical therapy...I could go on for days.

I started doing yoga as yet another option to try to fix these injuries, really enjoyed it, and became advanced enough to feel comfortable in intermediate vinyasa (aka, flow) classes. However, I've always struggled with some hip opening poses, but not others. For example, I can move easily into pigeon pose and and be in correct alignment, but if I tried to move into cow pose, I could barely get my knees in alignment, let alone keep my sits bones on the floor! I started thinking I needed to do something else besides vinyasa and yin yoga to open up my hips, and bought this DVD after reading the reviews.

I've done this program ONCE and can already notice a difference! For the first time in months, my hip flexors don't feel tight or ache. At the end of this program, my glutes touched my heels while I was in child's pose, something I have NEVER achieved unless someone was pressing on my back.  I was also made of aware of how incredibly weak my adductors are and how much my abductors were compensating for this weakness. I am going to try to do these exercises 3 times a week and see how  I improve.  I can't wait!

A few things you should know about this DVD:
1. You will need two yoga blocks and a yoga strap in addition to your regular mat and towel. I didn't have blocks or a strap, and was able to improve with some old shoe boxes and a towel, but actual blocks and a strap would make it much easier.
2. You will also need access to a wall to do some of the exercises, as well as a table and/or sturdy chair (one that doesn't roll) to do some stretches.
3. Some of the strengthening exercises require the ability to ""slide"" your towel over a tile or wood floor, which can be a problem for those of us who only have carpet and have a microscopic kitchen. Jill says you can adjust for this by putting trash bags under your towel, but that didn't work very well for me. However, there are only 2 or 3 exercises that require sliding, so I will just look for an alternative.
4. The main ""program"" is approximately 60 minutes in duration, but a good portion of this is Jill Miller explaining the poses and guiding you through the routine. I think I will be able to do all of the stretches/poses/exercises in about 30-40 minutes (depending on how long each position is held) once I am more familiar with the program.
5. There is an introduction section as well as several ""shorter"" segments that focus on balance poses and breathing.

3356844,5,B00144IMHO,"Some back ground to contextualize my review:  I have danced professionally on and off for 30 years (retired from serious dance in 1992 after 2 knee surgeries), studied Pilates with a genius, later got certified to teach, taught full force full-contact self defense for 12 years, in depth practices of both kundalini and vinyasa styles of yoga for 30 years +/-. ETC.  So in addition to pretty consistent troubles from my knee, I have a diastasis  (a split of the rectus abdominus; something like a hernia) from 2 pregnancies at "" an advanced age"", which have caused, sometimes, debilitating back and leg pain.

SOOOO; Jill MIller's Hip Helpers video did more for my hip, back and knee mobility and ease than I had in years! After one particular exercise, THE FIRST TIME I TRIED IT, I had release in my lumbar spine that I have not had in YEARS!  I did these simple exercises, some of which are derived from yoga, some have a more PT reference, every other day...not even every exercise each time and my knee is better than it's been in years!

I have spent so much time and money and worry trying to solve the puzzle of my particular body. And these exercises have been the missing piece of the rehab puzzle.

All have enabled me to go back to a full yoga practice, play soccer with my kids, sleep better and most importantly feel more comfort and  OPTIMISM about the process of aging.

3356856,5,B00144IMHO,This is by far the best hip video I've had.  It's too soon for me to give any results but I'm certain I will be feeling better very soon.  I love it!,1364428800,,149,3.625
3356857,5,B00144IMHO,"I had knee surgery (orthoscopic) recently because I lost most of my cartiledge (old age sucks).  My Physical Therapist noticed that my hips were extremely inflexible and surmised that much of my knee problems probably came from this.  She noted that I needed to use my hips so my knees weren't overcompensating and taking all of the brunt of jumps, running, etc.  I tried different workouts on DVD and this one sounded really good...so I took a risk and bought it.

I was (and am) very happy with the reward for the risk.  Miller explains each stretch/exercise in (mostly) plain English so I could understand how to do it properly.  I've never felt such deep stretches (anywhere) in my hips before.  Here are few hints for how I got the most out of it.

I would jump straight to the ""Hip Practice"" and watch it first to see what each exercise is.  If you want more detail on a specific stretch, then go to the Hip Workshop (the Hip Workshop explains in detail).  While the DVD doesn't have ""chapters"" for each stretch (this would be nice for jumping to favorites), if you use the Fast Forward on your player, you can skip a stretch - which was nice.  There were at least two that I couldn't do because I didn't have the ""equipment"" needed.

I've seen other reviews that say this isn't really ""yoga"" and that she doesn't focus on breathing like yoga normally does.  I don't know what these reviewers were talking about.  I watched the into in which she talked about her extensive experience with yoga and how she is incorporating different styles and knowledge.  I take a yoga class weekly and I found I learned more about breathing techniques from this DVD than I have after a year of class.  She has a section on Breathing (15 mins) which I recommend.

All in all, I LOVE this DVD.  I do it daily now.  And the results have been astounding.  I'm still rehabbing my knee and the work my Physical Therapist had done with me was great...and was getting me back on the courts...BUT.  After doing this workout (actually only 30 mins of the 58), I played for the first time pain free.  I felt stronger overall.  This combined with improvements to my posture and the PT has done wonders.

I'm looking forward to trying out her knee rehab DVD next.  I also plan on buying this DVD as a gift for others.",1364169600,4,2295,4.472289156626506

3356860,5,B00144IMHO,"I purchased this DVD about 2 1/2 months ago and I am extremely pleased with Jill Miller's program. I read other reviews prior to purchase and can agree with all that is written about this video.

1. It works!
2. It's grueling...but worth it.
3. Jill Miller is right when she stated that hips take a long time to heal.
4. Some of the exercises are difficult to perform but it gets easier as your hips gain flexibility.
5. To get the most from this DVD it is important to watch the whole thing and treat it as a learning experience.
6. The breathing primer really helps with your practice of the exercises.

I am an avid runner and bike rider who was diagnosed with bilateral trochanteric bursitis about 1 year ago. Following the advice of my Orthopedic physician I received injectons in both hips and was told to rest until it felt better. Well that never happened. Accupuncture helped but only so much. After speaking with a Physical Therapist who said I needed to stretch my IT Band and Psoas muscles I knew I needed to do this on my own. I am very grateful that I found this DVD and that Jill Miller presents herself as experienced, truthful, and helpful to those who have purchased her DVD.

2 1/2 months ago I was not able to walk without pain. Currently I am walking and biking without pain. I continue to stretch with Jill Miller on her DVD and am finding that as my hips gain flexibility the stretches on her DVD become easier to do.",1341446400,9,1440,4.385767790262173
3356861,5,B00144IMHO,"I'm in my early thirties and have had minor to very annoying pain (causing a slight limp) in my left hip for 2 years due to a minor fall.  I bought Jill's DVD based on the reviews and am so glad I did. I could immediately feel the weak areas in my hip on day 1. After only a few days I could feel those areas strengthening. Now the areas feel wonderfully stretched and excercised - It's amazing how targeted each pose is! Two of the stretches feel too strenuous for my groin & knees so I replace with more gentle stretches for those areas, but everything else was 100% worth trying something new to help your self conquer your pain!",1323475200,6,632,4.223140495867769
3356862,5,B00144IMHO,"I read all of the reviews before buying this DVD, and I'd like to address the one 1 star review as well as add other comments that may help those of you who are ready to really work to improve your hip flexibility and/or reduce pain.  Although I love this DVD, I can relate to what the 1 star reviewer said.  ""Hip Helpers"" is not really a yoga routine, and Jill Miller alludes to that.  She mentions that these exercises will make your yoga sessions better, although I think the Hip Helpers routine is great all on its own.

The 1 star reviewer also mentioned that this DVD feels much like physical therapy.  I agree somewhat, although I think the format and setting are much nicer than any PT I've done.  To me, it feels more like yoga but without the focus on breath (which is a huge part of any true yoga practice).

Another reviewer commented that the practice gets grueling in the abductor series.  I agree, but that's because I have weak abductors and desperately need to strengthen them to loosen up my adductors!  I would bet that a person with flexible, supple hips can do those exercises with ease.

Anyone looking to really loosen up his/her hips needs to understand the principles of agonist and antagonist muscles.  It's actually easy to understand in spite of the fancy names (and you can learn much more by searching the web using those keywords).  The principle is similar to the ""equal but opposite force"" idea from Newton's Third Law of Motion.  The large muscles that are part of the pelvic girdle are categorized into groups based on their functions (flexing or extending the hip, adducting or abducting the legs, etc.)  As an example, when the hip abductors are weak, other muscles in the hip will work much harder to compensate.  That leads to chronic tightness and shortening in the compensating muscles, while the weak muscles stretch too much.  This sets up a vicious cycle, and stretching the chronically tight muscles will only help slightly.  The only thing that will really work is to figure out which muscles are weak and strenghthen those.

When your muscles are balanced (i.e. you have no weak agonist hip muscles and no overcompensating, tight antagonist muscles), you'll have supple hips and much greater range of motion as well as more power from your leg muscles.  You'll also transfer 'load' (your body weight) from muscles onto your skeleton, where it belongs.  Your bones are meant to bear your weight, not your muscles, tendons, and ligaments.  By balancing your muscles, you can avoid a lot of chronic conditions as you age and you'll feel a lot better.

That's a long-winded explanation, but I thought it might help those of you like me who sit way too much and sleep in a semi-fetal position (both of which can cause tight hip flexors).  People seem to think stretching is the answer to tight hips, but that's only a small part of the answer.  The Hip Helpers DVD really does work if you do it regularly.  Just don't expect overnight results.  It took a long time for you to get tight hips, and our sedentary lifestyles keep adding to our hip muscle imbalances.

Of all the things I've tried, I think this DVD is the most effective single way to balance the hips and make them supple.  I also like Jill's personable manner and the DVD's production values.  The studio she's in is well lit and serene.  You do have to use some props, but remember it's going to take some effort to get your hips realigned and in balance.  BTW, anyone with tight hips should always use props in yoga anyway; you should be able to truly RELAX into the stretches without 'guarding' your muscles against overstretching.  Tight-hipped yogis should sit on a folded blanket or other prop that lifts your hips above the level of your knees when you're sitting cross-legged.  If you don't, your spine will be in the wrong position, and you'll get uncomfortable and fatigue quickly.",1302307200,123,3897,4.675477239353891
3356863,5,B00144IMHO,"I am a marathon runner suffering from tight hips on long runs.  This DVD was recommended by a yoga teacher friend, and the exercises/poses shown have been great for relieving my hip tightness and strain on 18+ mile runs.  Well worth it.",1297209600,8,236,4.595238095238095
3356864,5,B00144IMHO,"The DVD is already helping my hip and back, and I've only done it a couple of times.  I love how she has a workshop prior to the session so you have a better understanding of the correct way to do or modify the moves, and also how she explains the names of the muscles involved.  I've found it helps me focus on the problem areas much better.  If you are new to yoga, take care not to strain yourself as some of the poses are challenging.  I've been doing yoga for 2 years in a studio, but I can usually only get there once a week.  This a wonderful addition to do at home for a daily practice, and I expect to use all three in the series for quite some time.",1294099200,,659,3.924812030075188
3356865,4,B00144IMHO,"This DVD is part of the Yoga Link series offered by Pranamaya. The instructor for this series is Jill Miller, who had previously created her own self-produced video series called Yoga Tune Up. This series from Pranamaya (which also includes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-Link-Shoulder-Shape-Up-with-Jill-Miller/dp/B00144IMHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga Link: Shoulder Shape-Up with Jill Miller</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-Link-Core-Integration/dp/B00144IMHE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga Link: Core Integration</a>) incorporates many aspects of Miller's prior work but adds excellent production values plus a variety of additional workout and DVD options. For starters, there are two main aspects to this DVD, the Hips Workshop, in which Miller uses live instruction to break down the individual moves in great detail, and the Hips Practice, where Miller presents the same exercises via voiceover for a more flowing experience. Also included is a 16-minute Breath Primer: this same segment appears on all three of the DVDs in the Yoga Link series, and it offers an opportunity to obtain detailed instruction on the types of pranayama, or yogic breathing, which Miller utilizes in these practices. Miller uses various props throughout this DVD, including a yoga mat, 2 blocks, a strap, a wall, and a chair/other ledge. There are also several segments in which she glides along her smooth wood floor on a blanket; if you have carpet instead of flooring at home, Miller suggests substituting a trash bag, but I found that this didn't work very well.

The Hip Workshop includes a 60-minute instructional session, 7 minutes of Hip ""Extras,"" and 16 minutes of Advanced Asymmetrical Standing Poses. The workshop itself focuses on the six basic directions of movement for the hips (a brief primer on this precludes the workshop). The Workshop chapters are broken down into Hip Warm Ups, Flexion/Extension, Internal/External Rotation 1, Adduction/Abduction, and Internal/External Rotation 2. Starting immediately with the long Warm Ups sequence, Miller brings fire and heat to the muscles of the entire lower body with Monk Walks, or static lunges; additional warm-up moves offer variations on lunges and hip circles. The leg stretches which follow are performed lying on the floor, and then Miller leads the viewer through a pelvic series which includes a slow cycle of Kapalabhati breathing.  Upon completion of the Warm Ups, Miller returns to standing for the more targeted stretching work. Some of these moves are more traditional, such as lunges, but Miller often adds unique variations, such as an asymmetrical element (e.g., placing one foot on a block or a chair). Then it's back to the floor for more rotational movements. The final sequence of Internal and External Rotation includes many types of rolling motions for the hips in both standing and lying positions. The two chapters found in the Extras segment, ""Sitting Seiza"" and ""Ankle Churning,"" focus on stretching mainly the ankles and toes in a seated position.

As mentioned previously, the 58-minute Hips Helper practice offers all of the same exercises that are in the workshop, but here Miller is instructing via voiceover for a more flowing routine. Also, she sets aside time to rest in savasana at the end of the practice (although she encourages practicing savasana at the end of the workshop as well). The Advanced Asymmetrical Standing Poses, part of the Workshop section, can be performed after either the workshop or the practice. In this 16-minute series, Miller teaches some tricks for working on warrior 2, side flank pose, and reverse side flank, using the blocks and the wall to demonstrate how to go more deeply into these postures.

The main goal of these hip exercises is to mobilize the hips from every angle, and Miller certainly achieves this objective (your muscles will no doubt achingly bear witness to this fact). Overall, Miller's advanced knowledge of anatomy and human movement shines through her teaching, and her easygoing, down-to-earth style allows her to connect with the viewer in a straightforward manner. Although the DVD case rates the intended audience for this practice as ""beginners to teachers,"" I think that those new to yoga are likely to be intimidated by the level of flexibility and endurance demanded by this practice. As an intermediate yogi myself, I find many of the exercises quite strenuous and grueling.  However, those looking to open their hips from every possible angle can't go wrong with this DVD.",1292544000,,4634,5.548797736916549
3356866,4,B00144IMHO,Really great product. I lucked out with this one purchasing it based on just the reviews. I am a martial artist and have Trochantric Bursitis in both of my hips. This video along with a styrofoam roaller has done wonders to stretch all those muscles in my hips and my IT band.,1292025600,8,276,4.326923076923077
3356867,4,B00144IMHO,"Jill Miller's hip, shoulder, and Kneehab DVDs have been good resources for me, in terms of increasing ease and range of motion in those joints. She really knows musculoskeletal anatomy and function, and it shows in her work. Her DVDs are well-done, with clear instruction, nice production values, and a down-to-earth approach. There are some nice extras included here besides the actual workout, and the workshop gives some good pointers for going more deeply into some standing poses. This isn't a routine that I savor the way I do others, but it works and is worth it.

I initially gave this DVD a 5-star review, based on how well-done it is and how thoroughly it works the hips from different angles. After spending a few more months with the DVD, however, I've changed my review to 4 stars. Items 2 & 3 in my list below are why I changed my rating. I'm a huge Jill Miller fan, so for me to dock this a star is kind of a big deal for me.

Some considerations about this Hip Helpers DVD:

1. Despite the title which somewhat confuses things, this DVD is not a demonstration of various yoga asanas. It has a broad selection of hip openers (including some yoga-flavored ones) that help loosen tight hips, and, if desired, prepare one for better performance of asanas that benefit from ease in the hips. If you're looking for a DVD that is all or mostly yoga, this isn't it. If you want help with muscle imbalances and tightness in your hips, this DVD can help you pinpoint and work with those.

2. I have knee issues (PF compartment), and the runner's-lunge-type exercises, as well as the related hip flexor stretches with the front of the foot hanging off of the furniture edge, are out of the question for me. These are very effective stretches, no doubt, but they are unsafe for compromised knees like mine. I feel like they could be especially risky if someone isn't using a piece of very stable furniture that's the proper height for the stretch. Of course, each person is responsible for his/her own safety, but it's all too easy to get into the middle of one of these stretches and then belatedly realize that one's highly flexed knee is the victim of unfavorable forces, especially in those seconds when the knee is hanging and unsupported by the floor.

Though they may not pack as much punch, there are safer versions of these stretches to accommodate my type of problem. Because tight hips can have such a negative impact upon the knees, a well-rounded hip stretching program is important to counteract tight hips, but I believe the DVD would better serve people with knee problems if it came with strong warnings to people with damaged knees about potentially harmful knee movements and recommended modifications in the workshop portion of the DVD.

3. A few of the exercises require a smooth floor (on which to slide a blanket for working adductors, etc.). I mention this so you won't be unpleasantly surprised if you have carpet, like I do. I purchased this DVD before there were reviews mentioning this point. There are other exercise DVDs out there that require a smooth floor, and I've always appreciated it when the product description lists everything that will be needed to do the complete workout, including a smooth floor. The product description for this DVD did not include that info, and it should have. Additionally, the instructor could have suggested alternative movements for carpet-owners within the workshop section of the DVD. In another one of her DVDs, she suggests using garbage bags under a yoga blanket to provide a smooth, slick surface. When using that DVD, I tried this, but it was clumsy and didn't work well for me.

4. This routine is prop-dependent. I use a mat, block, strap, and, for those various movements in which I need to elevate one foot on a piece of furniture, I use two things: a folding chair placed against a wall, and for a higher prop, a bookcase. You could use other types of furniture or props, as long as they're stable.

5. I'd describe my yoga practice as lower-intermediate-level. Although I've had a home practice for several years now, I've always had very tight musculature, and increased flexibility comes very slowly to me. There are some of Miller's hip helpers that I can do in only a very limited way--e.g., where she abducts one leg 90 degrees from the other leg, I can go only a few degrees and inches. But that limited movement, done in a controlled and focused manner, challenges me and works muscles that need to be worked. I'm also balance-challenged, and she integrates a little balance work into some of the movements. Overall, I find her DVDs very challenging, but not intimidating. I've gotten some good ideas from this DVD on how to better work my tight hip muscles.

If you're a beginner, injured, or lacking in flexibility, don't be scared away from Jill's DVDs. She's a wonderful instructor. If you have knee problems, do exercise special care with this one, though. While she is unbelievably (to me) flexible, she seems to endeavor to make her routines accessible and possible for people like me, who haven't yet developed significant physical confidence and flexibility. If you're unsure about whether her work is a good fit for you, check out her website, as well as a sample clip on YouTube from this Hip Helpers DVD.",1286928000,29,5308,4.72972972972973
3356868,5,B00144IMHO,"Jill Miller is brilliant in her ability to use the body to connect to the differnet poses. Her use of anatomy and movement inspires to use all your tools as a teacher.

3356869,4,B00144IMHO,"This is a pretty challenging routine.  It is the most thorough of any yoga hip routines I have found so far.  If you don't like to use props, you may not like this one.  While I don't have a wall space to do yoga, I was able to effectively do all of the exercises in the video with some sort of temporary solution, except for the ones where she uses a rug on the floor for sliding exercises.  If you have a carpeted floor, you are supposed to use a garbage bag.  This didn't work for me because I kept sliding off the garbage bag.

So, I was frustrated that I couldn't do those exercises effectively.  Even so, I find this program to be very helpful for hip pain/issues.",1263168000,5,670,4.147286821705427
3356870,1,B00144IMHO,"I like yoga and am more flexible than average, but my hips tend to be tight which is why I bought this video. I expected it to be a great yoga routine full of helpful hip poses like pigeon and ankle-to-knee seat. It did not include either one of those basic hip-opening yoga asanas - in fact it didn't really feel like a yoga routine at all. It felt more like doing boring physical therapy. Also you need to have props to do this video, including two blocks, a ledge at about knee height, another ledge about waist height, a hardwood floor, a blanket, and possibly a strap unless you are very flexible in your hips already (in which case, why are you buying this video?). Aside from all this, the video is just dull. I was incredibly disappointed.",1257120000,21,747,4.381294964028777

Yoga alone never did that. It has also improved my yoga practice.  I am now an avid Jill Miller fan, and I hope to meet her one day and tell her how much I love her Yoga Link workouts.  I bought all three, and I highly recommend them.  I had searched for so long for stretching workouts before I knew about Yoga Link, only to be bored with standard routines that I ended up not doing.

8254253,5,B00144IMHO,"This video has helped my hips so much. My ball and socket grind so staying flexible and loose is sonething I'll have to dedicate to for the rest of my life. Therapy for 8 weeks and a steroid shot only helped temporarily. Since I've started this, I can wear my boots and heels again with no pain. No more daily aches and pains whether it be from walking or just standing too long.. it's all gone! I can play volleyball again without holding back. I do this about twice a week and I couldn't be more thankful!",1480896000,4,507,4.237113402061856

8254255,2,B00144IMHO,"I just watched through the dvd. I wish I could've went ahead and jumped in but unfortunately it seems I don't have all the necessary equipment yet. Looks like I need to buy two yoga blocks, yoga band, yoga blanket, and giant yoga cube. I'll also need to pull up the rug and install hardwood floors in my workout area in order to do a couple exercises where you have to swish your feet around on a towel.",1471564800,,403,4.17948717948718

8254257,5,B00144IMHO,"Hoping this will heal my bursitis. I'm a 52 y.o. fat female just easing into yoga. I have two mildly sore hips due to bursitis. I found Jill Miller while surfing on Amazon and ordered this dvd. I found it so helpful that I ordered her book, The Roll Model, and the balls. I can't wait for them to arrive. My only criticism is that I wish she included more modifications in the dvd, though I have been able to figure out my own. I would also love it if she had a single rehabilitative daily dvd for us old and out of shape folks. Now that I've said that though, I'm sure any beginning yoga will do. I just love the way she is so thorough and I trust her instinctively. Thanks Jill,",1451260800,,680,4.082089552238806
8254258,5,B00144IMHO,"I've only used it once, and already love it!  I have bursitis in my hips, and that has been limiting my activity, including my regular yoga routine which I had stopped doing.  I could tell right away that this was going to help, and I'm looking forward to getting stronger and back to my regular yoga routine.",1451174400,,309,4.4035087719298245
8254259,5,B00144IMHO,"MY YOGA SKILL LEVEL: Happy beginner....I've been using the same 2 beginner level yoga DVDs for like 5 years now. I know the basic poses. I have them committed to memory. While that gives me some measure of confidence when I'm doing it, I don't practice consistently and am not a flexible person. I work at a PC for hours on end, text too much, garden too hard, etc. I have lots of repetitive use issues! My shoulders are crunchy. My neck is knotty. My hamstrings are tight. I'm a trainwreck. My massage therapist thinks I should just take up drinking. This series has been EXACTLY what I needed! I have the shoulders & hips videos...don't have core just yet.

As far as this series goes...If your hips/psoas/butt/that vicinity is an issue but you're new to yoga, don't worry. No matter your skill level, always remember that if you can't go fully into a pose, life goes on. You still benefit from the effort. If you'd like another minute to breathe it in, hit pause. Jill explains the reason why you're doing each stretch and exactly what part of you it will help. I sit Indian-style at a computer constantly...my hip flexors, psoas and glutes hate me.

I've never been a fan of Jill Miller's flow yoga, but this stuff is just perfect for my needs. A lot of traditional stuff mixed with nontraditional asanas that Jill created to fix & maintain areas she'd injured as a dancer. If you have any waist/below the waist issues, this takes you through the full range of motion in a non-fussy, non-ohm sort of way. As you begin to take your body through a complete range of motion, you can feel tightness where you probably had no idea you had it. Blood starts going places where it is needed.

The hips workshop is a good place to start. Learn each of the poses that you'll need to integrate them into the more flowing workout. I can't say enough about this series. It is as challenging as you allow it to be and so beneficial. As someone who has tried frequent massage, foam rollers, standard beginner's yoga...you name it...I can tell you that after my first session with Hip Helpers I felt like a new person from the waist down. I hadn't had movement like that in years. Not hyperbole, either. It was just amazing.

(If you don't have yoga blocks, use books. If you have a hip-height table or bookshelf or couch nearby, that will be helpful for a few of the poses. Improvise!)",1440547200,4,2374,4.5011600928074245
