I was privileged to have met William Haines in his home in 1954, years after he was no longer in acting, but fully successful with his interior design company.  What a gracious man!",1475280000,,282,4.403846153846154
8409419,4,B003YJ8998,"Wow... this movie from 1932  is not remastered or restored but the picture quality is not perfect but still very good. The only minus point (star) I have - the DVD doesn't contains any subtitles (english or for deaf hearing people).

The movie: William Haines playing a husband who's loving another woman and is a radio producer where is producing ""boring"" shows and commercial. Through an accident he killed a woman and is running then away. The irony: through the radio reporters and the police is searching after him he became famous through the radio.

Starring: William Haines, Anita Page and in her second movie role: Hattie McDaniel who had LATER her most memorable role as Mammy (House Servant) in ""GONE WITH THE WIND"" IN 1939 (Was the first African-American to win an Academy Award).

FAZIT: if you want see amazing looking William Haines in a ""serious"" role, then you're here right.",1307577600,5,892,4.848684210526316
