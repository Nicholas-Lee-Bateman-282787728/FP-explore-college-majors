This is a good film to watch if your cable goes out and it is pouring rain outside.  You may want to just rent this film first before buying it.",1130025600,2,272,4.0
859274,5,6304396201,This dvd does have english subtitles throughout all the spoken language but you have to select it from the dvd setup title menu rather than change it using the dvd remote during the film,1121731200,2,186,4.5
859275,3,6304396201,"Going into this movie, I thought it was going to be an over the top, ridicuously violent samurai fantasy movie.  It was actually a lot different than I expected.  The story and costumes were at some times over the top, but the director intentially made this movie caring about things like plot/character developement, cinematography, and well done sets.  It seems like they put a lot of time and effort into the production of this film.  It's pretty interesting and entertaining to watch, but their wasn't as much fighting as I expected.  It's a samurai movie with a fairly good pace (although not particularly gory/violent)...until the end, which the entire movie is spent building up and then it just kind of...ends, fairly abrubtly. An enjoyable samurai/fantasy movie (I heard it was a main influence

on the old video game series Samurai Showdown), but I'd suggest renting it and not buying it.",1107129600,3,898,4.953333333333333
859276,3,6304396201,"This film is an essential purchase for all Chiba fans. Most of the cast of this film also starred in 'Ninja Wars'....the English overdubs were highly amusing(they just changed the voices around!!) Story: a homosexual samurai is brought back from the dead, rejects Christianity, worships Satan, gets a poss of suicidal sword-masters, goes on the rampage.....its the same as all the others, however, it a cross between Ninja Wars and that [terrible] Gunslinger flick with Sharon Stone in it. Sonny Chiba is Jubei and the son of a minor noble who succumbs to the [samurai's] magick. Chiba kills all of the poss exept the monk-alcoholic who has fantisies of killing women. The film must have been cut. Only buy this on DVD 'cos the American VHS version had the picture quality of a thrice-pirated '70's porno!!!! ...",1043452800,4,812,4.934306569343065
859277,4,6304396201,"I thought at first this was filmed for the asian TV market because of the obvious set design and film quality at the beginning(reminiscent of Dark Shadows). However, the film slowly builds in pace and scope until it's climax: a duel in an inferno, the burning remains of the mansion of the shogun. It is easily up to the par of the low budget asian action movies of the period. The mythology of the film is quite interesting, both in the time period it is placed and the characters that are included. The samurai that Toshiro Mifune brought to western audiences, Musashi Miyamoto, plays a key part. The only significant flaw to this film is the previously mentioned dub. Not only are the voices not timed properly but almost all the voice actors are VERY poorly chosen and seemingly refuse to emote with their characters. There are some moments with dramatic overacting but anyone seeking information on a film titled Samurai Reincarnation shouldn't be seeking subtlety. Also of note, many of the key players of this film including Sonny Chiba and the Director himself were involved in the film The Legend of the Eight Samurai, a film much like this one with similar qualities and flaws(including the dub).",1023580800,9,1206,4.802884615384615
859278,5,6304396201,Very good plot. Very good action . Very entertaining. I saw this film in a theatre. I am buying it now in video. Unfortunately i don't know if this version have english subtitles. However there is a version dubbed in English  The hero is not of the family Yagiu and Chiba is Jubei. It is difficult to  tell if his Tsuba(gard) is an Yagiu tsuba. In any case as you know he never  used the Tsuba. Very good swordsman,934070400,4,414,4.215189873417722

7869616,1,6304396201,"Wonderful movie, but this copy looks like a fifth generation VHS bootleg that someone found after an attic fire and dumped on a DVD.

Buy elsewhere.",1436313600,,148,4.6923076923076925

7869618,5,6304396201,"This is a great movie, but avoid the 'Miracle Pictures' version.  You would be better off buying one of the other ones used.  The version that lists 'Makai Tensho' on the package is uncut and an excellent transfer.

The Miracle Pictures version looks like it was recorded from a TV broadcast or a bad video tape.  It is truly crappy.  There's a persistent hum, the colors keep shifting and the resolution is terrible.  Also English only; always a problem if you want to know how the actors are using their voice.  To add insult to injury, this version is 87 minutes long instead of the 122 minutes of the original.  It's also pan-and-scan.  Woof!

On the other hand, the Toei Company, Ltd version (the original) is uncut, has both English dubbing AND the original Japanese.  Note for full English subtitles, use the 2nd English choice; the first only translates the written Japanese and assumes you are watching the English dubbed version.

Well worth seeing, IF you get the right version; otherwise, forget it.",1422057600,4,1011,4.780346820809249

7869620,1,6304396201,"This is actually a pretty decent little movie ruined by a god-awful transfer. Specifically, it looks as though this version has been copied straight over from the notoriously rancid VHS version; it's blurry, the colors are muddy, and the whole thing looks like a mess viewed through a pair of beer goggles, which destroys a movie whose primary appeal is its striking cinematography. The 2004 release (ASIN B0001Z3ID0) is likewise available from Amazon, and is vastly superior.

As for the movie itself, it's got some truly excellent visuals, including a climax involving a sword-fight inside a burning building. Sonny Chiba is his usual self, taciturn and suitably hardcore, and the other actors are all at least acceptable (though the dub leaves something to be desired). The plot is what it is, over-the-top ludicrous but done absolutely straight, and neither the performances nor the effects are so bad to inspire laughter--in fact, there are a couple of legitimately creepy moments. It's a story that's been done several times before in other Japanese movies, but this is about as good a telling of it as you'll find.

The movie is definitely recommended for fans of Japanese horror/action...just get the other version, please.",1330560000,,1231,5.15
7869621,4,6304396201,"Shiro, the leader of the christian uprising came back to life as a devil and is in a mission to recruite lost souls and bring them back to life as devils so he can get his revenge against the tokogawa shogunate.  Jubie Yagyu is the only one who can destroy the devil and put the recruited lost souls to rest in peace.

The scenery of the story is outstanding including the fight between the ghost musashi and jubie that is located at an ocean view with vast huge rocks on the background.  The action scenes r great as what u can always expect to chibas' samurai movies.  There are also great cast involved in the film including the young sanada (twilight samurai) and the great Tomisaburo Wakayama (lone wolf and cub) as Jubies ghost father.

The performace by the cast r sincere that make this samurai film a great drama with action.  Be sure to watch this movie with subtitles and avoid the english dub because it will only ruin the feeling of the movie.

The picture is great brought to you by Tokyo Shock and the sound is outstanding.  I highly recommend this film for people who likes a good storyline with great action.  I also recommend the legend of eight samurai for another great samurai fantasy film by Sonny Chiba.",1170979200,,1226,4.486486486486487
7869622,4,6304396201,"This movie has the great Sonny Chiba reprising his role from ""Shogun's Samurai"" but the tone of this movie is totally different.  The focus is on horror and the supernatural.  It takes awhile for the movie to warm up and a western viewer to figure out the plot, but after the first 30 minutes things really move.  The ending in the burning building is AWESOME!

Not as good as ""Shogun's Samurai"" but better than ""Legend of the Eight Saumrai"".  And watch it in Japanese with subtitles, for God's sake!",1167782400,,500,4.573033707865169
