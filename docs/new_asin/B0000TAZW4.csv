1942826,2,B0000TAZW4,"I'm a huge Monkees fan, and especially, a huge fan of the second season.  To begin, I'm with fans everywhere in being thrilled that the entire series is now available on DVD.  It's long overdue and I'm happy to have it.  BUT -- and it's a big BUT ---
BUT, this DVD set has many, many shortcomings that are unacceptable in this day and age.
1) AUDIO & VIDEO:  the quality of these film prints is, in many cases, abysmal.  Dirt, scratches and other damage abound.  I find it TERRIBLY difficult to believe that Rhino couldn't find a better copy for transfer.  Rather, I suspect they didn't want to spend the money 'cleaning' up the picture.  I work in TV & Film and ALL of these scratches and dirt marks COULD have been removed digitally.  But, they were not.  Likewise, the audio is often muddy and at very inconsistent volume.  Some passages are soft while others are way too loud.  A little quality control would have corrected this problem.
2) AUDIO COMMENTARY:  With the sole exception of Mike's commentary on ""Fairy Tale Monkees"", all the commentaries on the episodes are 99% worthless.  We're lucky if, in a given 28-minute episode, there are 5-10 minutes of actual commentary.  Most of the time, Davy or Peter just seem to be silently watching the episode alongside us.  And most of their comments are of the ""Hmm.  I remember that shirt!"" variety.  Just totally inconsequential and very few and far between.  If your major contribution on an audio commentary is, ""Hmmm, I remember that shirt!"", why bother even doing it?  It boggles my mind that Rhino even included these commentaries.  That's how inconsequential they are.  One would expect slightly more insightful commentary given that the commentators are, in fact, the Monkees themselves.
3) EXTRAS: The inclusion of ""33 1/3rd"" is almost worth the price of admission alone.  It's great to have and in the best quality I've seen thus far.  The other ""extras"" are two :30 clips of the Monkees as a trio in '69 on a variety show.  You will watch them once, and that's probably it.  Also, there is an interesting but overlong interview with the series Editor who sheds many interesting insights into putting the show together.
Bottom line: even though Rhino came through with ""33 1/3rd"", we're supposedly buying the set for the episodes of the series:  and that is where Rhino has totally dropped the ball.  Rhino must either a) feel that Monkees fans are not sophisticated enough to enjoy properly restored audio and video a la the Beatles Anthology, or, b) simply not wanted to spend the money doing a proper job.
This box set, we must hope, will NOT be the definitive collection of the Monkees TV series on DVD for very long.",1070928000,157,2685,4.703862660944206
1942827,4,B0000TAZW4,"I was really hoping there would be more commentary on this set considering the fact that they got Micky to do it. In fact, his commentary was a bit disappointing.
However, for fans, this is a great thing to own. Having the Monkees on DVD at my beck and call is absolutely fantastic. Bad moods are instantly eliminated with a bit of Monkee hilarity. It is a huge shame the show couldn't continue, new format or not.
As far as the packaging, it was nice to open the box and not have the DVDs and their sleeves leaping to my cat hair-covered carpet, eager to dust themselves up. The trivia continues to give me dozens of useless bits of monkee knowledge that I eagerly mention until someone quiets me.
All in all, this is a great set to have despite a couple disappointments.",1070496000,2,772,4.405594405594406

1942829,4,B0000TAZW4,I just received it yesterday from another online marketplace.  I previewed it last night and I thought hey hey this is the grooviest product I've ever ordered like the frist season boxed set in the spring of this year.  All of the 26 episodes in that season plus 33 1/3 Revolutions Per Monkee are in there expect the vintage commercials like the Kool-Aid ones in which the Monkees minus Peter did after their TV show was canceled by NBC.  But it's okay now and now that includes my collection of the Monkees that I will always treasure them forever.  THE MONKEES RULE!  MISSION: ACCOMPLISHED.,1069718400,2,592,4.653846153846154
1942830,5,B0000TAZW4,"Season Two looks a little tired in retrospect. The boys may have had more power, but they  sure didn't know what to do with it!  What kept Season One from being worthless pop trash was the earnest manner in which Mike, Micky, Peter and Davy applied themselves to farcical situations. Also the way the show would segue from comedy to (light) drama and back again. This complexity is what made the films of Charlie Chaplin such classics. Without that sincereity, farce no longer works. It becomes insulting to watch. And that's Season Two!  The only message seems to be that the Monkees hate being the Monkees and they think it's all stupid and so are you for watching. Not the best basis for comedy. So why watch? Well, because there are still some shining moments and great songs in the second season, in spite of all their efforts to muck it up.  While Peter's self righteous hippy trip and Micky's embarassing mugging may try your patience, keep watching and you'll hit lots of paydirt, even if it isn't of the same calibre as Season One.

Micky Dolenz's commentary is gratingly shrill; if only he had taken a valium or something, he might have cut the shtick and come up with some insightful reminiscences, which is all anyone wants of these commentaries, isn't it? Mike's commentary is a little better in ""Fairy Tale"", which--surprisingly--he cites as the most fun he ever had making the show!

As for the 33 1/3 Revolutions Per Monkee special at the end, it's painful to behold. Although, as an archivist, I'm still glad it's here. Even Micky in his commentary says at one point, ""Is it just me or is this really boring?""  I suppose it holds some morbid fascination, like the proverbial car crash that you just can't help but watch. But mostly, it's a chaotic and pretentious hodge podge that doesn't do much to credit the idea that the Monkees should have had complete control over their product. I much prefer them ""in bondage"" before the lunatics took over the asuylum! Still, this is a must for Monkee fans and they will just have to resign themselves to the fact that this time out, you have to weather some bad moments to get to the good ones.",1069459200,4,2154,4.608355091383812
1942831,4,B0000TAZW4,"The second season box set is much like the first, in that it is overpriced, with suprisingly poor sound (the 5.1 selection is best but even that is not anywhere near what it should be), but otherwise a great compilation of all the episodes.  Some fans prefer the tighter first season, and some the looser second year.  I go for the second season, primarily because the songs are superior (with nearly all stemming from their two finest works ""Headquarters"" and ""Pisces, Aquarious...""--just imagine what those teenyboppers back in late '67 must've thought when they heard ""Star Collector"" for the first time!), and I do enjoy the greater spontaneity and half-improvised nature of the scripts.  The group look like they are having fun, goofing around on set and filming cool tags for the end of each show that parody normal television formulas.  The jokes are more sophisticated, culminating in the
delightful ""Frodis Caper"", directed by Dolenz and quite possibly the first sitcom episode to feature drug humor.  There are also cool guest spots by Zappa, Tim Buckley and Charlie Smalls, a stunning a capella rendition of ""Riu Chiu"" for the Christmas episode, and the increased color and intensity of the psychedelic era in general.  Note also the transitional nature of the earliest episodes filmed in the spring of '67 (which you can tell because Mickey's hair is still straight in them): some of the tightness of the first season remains (along with the use of several rejected first season scripts), but the wilder fashions and more risque humor of the latter half of the season also begins to creep in; it is this perfect combination of tight and loose which makes that period my favorite of the show.
The best episodes include the aforementioned ""Frodis Caper"", the touching ""Devil And Peter Tork"", the truly bizarre ""Monkees Watch Their Feet"" (with Pat Paulsen in fine form and Dolenz an absolute riot as a robot) and ""The Monkees' Paw"" (Dolenz in dazzling comic form once again).  The band were even allowed to parody their own frustration with the increasingly formulaic nature of the scripts in ""The Monkees In Paris""--which only proved that they weren't so formulaic, although Davy Jones still falls in love every other episode.  The commentaries are generally pretty good, and Mickey is a scream reminiscing about ""The Frodis Caper"".
Finally, the extras are nice, including some TV appearances and news footage, as well as the vastly underrated and overlooked special ""33 1/3 Revolutions Per Monkee"".  While ""33 1/3"" has a thin plot and some filler--including their worst filmed moment as singing chimps--it also contains some of their best-ever performances and *spectacular* guest stars, including Julie Driscoll (a superb singer) and her partner Brian Auger (a brilliant Keith Emerson-like organist), plus the three piano giants from the 50s: Little Richard, Fats Domino and Jerry Lee Lewis.  Add The Buddy Miles Express, and the complaint that The Monkees were second-billed in their own special becomes moot--with guest stars like these, who cares?  The band itself are still good, and the closing performance of ""Listen To The Band"" has to be seen to be believed--their mind-blowing final live appearance (before the 80s/90s reunion tours) being the total avant-garde antithesis of their commercial bubblegum image.  In short, the entire box set is worth it, although you'll have to pay a pretty penny for it...and be sure to turn the volume *way* up.",1069459200,8,3466,5.082746478873239
1942832,3,B0000TAZW4,"I was pretty stoked to hear that Rhino was finally going to release the second season of the Monkees' TV show. Once I got my package and opened it up I was pretty disappointed.
The 45 record sleeves that held the discs were very poorly glued together. One was completely open as it had not been glued properly at all!
The quality of the prints are very poor-there's lots of dirt on them in every episode. I was surprised at what a poor ""remastering"" job they had done on the prints. Many of the tunes (especially ""Goin' Down"") sound very muffled, no matter whether you set the audio at 2.0 or 5.1!
I like these episodes immensely but I can't help but express my disappointment at the poor quality of it all.",1069372800,9,707,4.363636363636363
1942833,5,B0000TAZW4,"I got off work at 9 pm yesterday when this set was released, rushed down to the store to pick up Season Two, and I finally went to bed at 6am this morning after watching each and every episode. I think that says enough about how great this set is :)",1069200000,2,249,3.9019607843137254
1942834,5,B0000TAZW4,"I have awaited this second season set (as the first season) for years. The quality of the prints are great with the well known exception of ""Monkees In Paris"" which was supposedly filmed in 16mm. The commentary is nice with the exception of Micky's contributions. It seems he does a lot of tearing apart, even the episode he directed ""The Frodis Caper""! His commentary to ""33 1/3 Revolutions Per Monkee"" (here in the correct running order unlike the way it was originally broadcast) is so trashing I wonder why RHINO even let it remain. I know good and well the special does take some getting used to for the non-Monkees fan, but for it's day, in my opinion, was a break-through in television. Brian Auger's commentary is great! I was quite surprised he remembered so much!
Now, like the title of my review, I feel there could have been more added. The bonus footage from ""The Glen Campbell Show"" shows the 2 more obscure comedy clips from that show but doesn't include their ""live"" medley, The ""Tear Drop City"" lip-sync ""video"" or the fabulous history musical skit. I wonder why they didn't press to get the Kool- Aid Commercials on this set also.
Seeing in most cases, this set is a bit more expensive, with less episodes, I feel there could have been a bit more. Funny that Michael even mentions their reunion episode but wouldn't let Rhino include it. That would have made it come full circle.
I have rated it 5 stars on the content and it's quality. If I was rating on how much effort was put into this project compared to the 1st season box set, I guess I would take a star away. The Packaging is as great as the 1st season with the psuedo 45 picture sleeves! I know most complain that the discs slide out but I never had that problem with the 1st box set.
Being a fan of ""Star Trek"" as well, I wished Paramont would put those episodes out in a set because at the average $17.99 per disc with 79 episodes plus the unaired pilot and 2 on each of all 40 disc's, it's roughly $720.00 minus local tax. That's neither hear nor there but I guess it does illustrate the great value of both of these sets!
Cheers to RHINO at keeping the costs at a minimum! I guess what I'm trying to say is, ""I'm A Believer""!",1069113600,6,2207,4.385365853658537

1942841,5,B0000TAZW4,"I purchased season one a couple of years back, so of course I
had to buy season two. Great music from The Monkees, as
always. I originally watched these in primetime on NBC as a
six - to - eight - year - old, and while the humor is somewhat
dated, there's a ""Romps Only"" feature that lets you enjoy the
songs on each disc by themselves if you so wish. The May,
1969 variety show was as cheesy as I remembered it; only
the presence of Fats Domino, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Little
Richard make it worth watching.",1491609600,,506,4.121212121212121

1942852,4,B0000TAZW4,"Definitely a fun show, fun music.  It was before my time, but find its still the same fun concept.  however, season 2 lost the charm, and many of the episodes are crazy themes such as Davy being put on trial by the devil and assorted hippie-themes that only seem to have made sense to 60s kids on dope or something.  Because they make no sense to me!  However, there are a handful of cute episodes to be found here, and great timeless music and crazy fun music videos.  Packaging could be better.  The multiple discs are layered one ontop of the other, so you usually end out having to pop out two discs to get the one you want, and they are difficult to pop out, so I fear scratching them up trying to remove them.  There are episode synopses, which I like, otherwise how in the heck do you know what you want by a mere episode title?  However, the synopses are UNDERNEATH the discs, another poor part of the design.  To read it all, you have to pop out the discs, which is majorly inconvenient.  However, it is the only DVD for this series that I see currently available, so there is really no choice but to endure terrible package design to see this fun retro series.",1464307200,,1170,4.301369863013699

Add ""The ""Frodis Caper"" and ""Wild Monkees""  and those episodes alone are worth it. But there's way more!  Sure there's some turkeys. But turkeys aside, there is enough great material here for 3 or 4 of good movies.  And better than most of the so-called hip movies of the day. There's even an acid reference by Mike:""Oh, I get it. You want us to take a little pill, and we see pretty colors climbing up the walls, right?"" Right! I get it!

In the second season The Monkees kind of move away from the ""Band in Search of Fame"" sitcom that was showcased in the first season, and tried to branch out into some different storylines.

Packed with special guest stars; Ruth Buzzi, Rip Taylor, Montel Landis, Vic Tayback.

Featuring some great 60's pop-rock tunes that The Monkees were known for:
Randy Scouse Git
Pleasant Valley Sunday
Cuddly Toy
Daydream Believer
Papa Gene's Blues
Goin' Down
What Am I Doing Hangin' Round

1942947,4,B0000TAZW4,"When I was very young ""The Monkees"" (in reruns) was unquestionably my favorite television show. I liked the strange juxtopositions, the odd wordplay, and the genuinely funny comedic action. I still do. I bought this set to compliment season one (I generally prefer the first season) and on balance I really enjoyed revisiting these shows for the first time in several decades. By this time in the show, the four guys were drifting apart and becoming far more independent thinkers, and it really shows in the overall level of cohesiveness in some of the episodes. Having said that, there are no episodes here I didn't enjoy, though some are true standouts. The sole reason I deducted a star from my rating is that the audio and video quality is pretty much 1960's original, and really should have been cleaned up by Rhino. As a note, season two is now available in a much less expensive package that is more conventional (making storage much less problematic.)

One thing I like about this set is the incredible trivia for each episode; the degree of minutiae covered is mindboggling and I examined it for every episode with great interest. One thing that's outstanding here are the cameos: I was most amused by Liberace in ""Art For Monkee's Sake"": the gold sledgehammer and Mike's reaction shots are utterly perfect in every way. Likewise Dub Taylor and Billie Hayes as Maw and Paw in ""Hillbilly Honeymoon"" are a riot. (Watch for Mike musically playing his nose and Peter as ""Uncle Raccoon."") For you ""Hogan's Heroes"" fans out there (and who isn't?) watch for Leon Askin as the head of the Druvanian National Ballet in the excellent Red Shoe episode (I am particularly fond of Peter's interrogation and in the performance of ""Chicken Lake."")

I miss Mike in that episode, though he more than makes up for it with classic bits like his bumbling LBJ impression in ""Monkee Mayor,"" and his rambling poetic lute playing in ""The Wild Monkees"" (""You're a thing of beauty to behold, sitting like a manifold."" Keats would not be as amused as I was.) Mike also excels in the classic favorite ""Fairy Tales."" I enjoyed Peter's commentary regarding Nesmith's ""Daily Nightly"" on that episode: ""If these lyrics have any meaning, I never picked up on it."" (And all this time, I thought it was just me!) I appreciated all the commentaries, though some were better than others: Peter's frank discussion of drugs (he does not recommend them) is especially candid, thoughtful, and appreciated. Mike also steals the show in ""The Monkee's Paw"" as the Regular Lama, in which Peter opines ""While there is a great deal of moral purpose on the side of the unions, they tend to want a stranglehold."" I like that comment as it demonstrates an independent thought outside of the Hollywood mainstream: the show skewered both sides of the political spectrum with equal aplomb and efficacy. Mike's shining moment came in the famous role-reversal intro to ""The Monkees Blow Their Minds"" with special guest Frank Zappa, which is perhaps the best moment of the entire series. The same episode features a great cameo of Burgess Meredith in costume as The Penguin. Don't miss it.

Micky really excels as a robot in ""Monkees Watch Their Feet"" (""Zlotnik welcomes you!"") The dual cameos of Stuart Margolin and Pat Paulsen makes this a comedic standout, though sadly there are some particularly bad scratches on the print that really needed to be cleaned up. Micky steps up as director on the final and most psychedelic episode, ""The Frodis Caper,"" which stars the great Rip Taylor as Wizard Glick. ""Some Like It Lukewarm"" has some great lines, including a dialogue centered on the setup line ""What is a woman but a rag, a bone, and a hank of hair?"" Mike's reaction to Davy in drag is classic and he's immediately labeled both ""a raggy, hairy bone"" and a ""hairy, bony rag."" This same episode features a better than average romp to ""The Door Into Summer"" in which Davy repeatedly attempts to escape.

""The Monkees in Paris"" is not one of my favorites, and is probably the least entertaining of any episode in the series. Bob Rafelson does a commentary for it that's more interesting than the show itself, and describes the episode as a ""shambles."" The Rafelson commentary provides an interesting history of The Monkees, but it tends toward bloviation as he speaks of himself in the third person extensively. Despite that I still enjoyed ""The Monkees in Paris,"" though the same can't be said for ""33 1/3 Revolutions Per Monkee"" which was a post-series TV special that is ponderous and almost unwatchable. Don't believe me? Watch for the paisley forklift and the ""Origin of Species"" interpretative dance. (Really.) In his commentary Micky says ""This is what's known as 'deconstructing the Monkees.'"" He's absolutely correct. Although Neil Sedaka has a terrible contribution to ""33 1/3 Revolutions Per Monkee,"" there is solace to be had here in the form of a long but sublimely interesting version of ""Listen to the Band,"" a great song. That performance marked the last time the four played together until 1986.

""The Monkees"" was groundbreaking television. Though much of the show was formulaic, the four principals really did have an effervescence that coalesced well on the small screen, and most of these episodes still hold up well today. I greatly enjoyed watching the second season for the first time in many years, and despite the technical shortcomings of this set, I recommend it without reservation.",1371168000,6,5465,4.891046386192017

1942950,5,B0000TAZW4,"As a musician-song writer and budding screen-writer I was interested in the second season of Monkees series and purchase it with the sole purpose of research in mind. Having carefully viewed it with an analytical mind, it dawned on me how much I really loved the series for so many different reasons. I wondered what was about this iconic successful television series that has withstood the test of time as every decade that rediscovers it fall in love with the stylistic shots, the music the laughter. Evidently they were ground breaking and the current sitcoms such as Glee and Nashville should hope to be that lucky. The commentaries of the creator Robert Rafelson was fascinating for me to hear as I felt he was sitting in my living room taking me through the process of making this project. I found it inspirational the current script I have been working on is influenced by this incredible musical series with iconic status. I doubt anyone can ever come close to the success of the Monkees television series but it is comforting to know the commentaries of the creator Robert Rafelson was fascinating for me to hear as I felt he was sitting in my living room taking me through the process of making this project.

I doubt anyone can ever come close to the success of the Monkees television series but it is comforting to know the left a legacy of American pop culture, music and laughter and oh, yeah the four guys were not bad to look at or listen to.

1942984,5,B0000TAZW4,"Above all else, ""The Monkees"" is aware of itself as a television program.

This might sound odd to most--but it's one of the most culturally provocative and intellectually rewarding aspects of the show. It was leagues ahead of its time in playful satire, cultural punning, and broad-view distillation of social and political issues (all wrapped up in what seemed to be endless zaniness). Most viewers are able to sit back and enjoy the sheer, unbridled fun and music, but there's enough meat here to fuel someone's thesis. The humorous, self-referential way in which the show (season 2, especially) acknowledges its own existence as a tv production, a moving picture, and a reference to the ""real"" within the ""created"" is done through fluid delivery of both the obvious and subtle. Characters frequently comment on filming techniques, episode length, and the television aspect itself, breaking it down into an amusing satire of all television and move styles and tropes that it existed with and after.

Placing the Monkees within their historical context--they are a completely, joyfully post-modern experience. They break down all expectation of television--challenging TV stereotypes, running through common themes (while poking fun at these same cliche expectations with over-the-top humor). Certain episodes have ground-breaking fluidity, exhibiting what was then new approaches to cut-scenes, layering, and blending of both the imagined story and the real filming. Episodes can be read as straightforward, innocent romps or as self-aware ideas, rollicking in its own awareness of its silly (yet biting) review of media themes.

For a scholar of art history, ""The Monkees"" offers a raw, underrated, fabulous approach to the deconstruction of cultural expectation while paradoxically existing as a marketable package.

If you've seen it before, and enjoyed it on the surface for its storylines, watch it again and pay attention to its unique sense of identity. No episode is to be taken seriously, and yet within that silliness, there is real, genuine social commentary. The writers were brilliant, the episodes well crafted, and the charm of the Monkees themselves endears to this day.

Season 2 shows it's possible to be filled with the serious, the silly, the satirical and the strong--and thoroughly enjoyable decades later.",1342137600,2,2331,5.410468319559229

1942996,5,B0000TAZW4,"Of course, it's the Monkees second season ... and we are well and truly crossing into strange places.

Strange as it might seem to modern audiences, this band was created by Hollywood, their music chosen and played by others and they acted and sang the songs.  Pretty much how most popular music is made today (think of almost any recording artist, making videos and doing concerts ... they have a serious team of people pre-packaging them.) However, the Monkees were created at a time when that was very uncool.  During the first year, as they worked almost constantly on their series and singing, they also started jaming and by the end of the season, recording their 3rd album entirely on their own (with Chip Douglas as producer and bass player.)  That album ""Headquarters"" was the second biggest album of the ""Summer of Love"" - The Beatles ""Sgt. Pepper's"" was the biggest.  They toured, Mickey and Peter showed up at Monteray Pop Festival, hung out with all the coolest musicians, Hendrix opened for them breifly ... and returned for season 2.

This season starts out with what looks to be some left overs from season 1 and things are fairly normal ... but suddenly, Mickey has a perm, Mike is wearing dark shades, and the music is getting pretty far out.  A song of Peter's, the Love In ode ""For Pete's Sake"" becomes the closing theme, Mike is writing in a variety of modes, including the L.A. riot inspired ""Daily Nightly"" and even Davey seems to have turned a bit seedy with songs like ""Star Collector"" (an ode to groupies.)  These Monkees have grown up and taken over.  The last episode is directed by Micky himself and looks as if they were trying a new direction.  But, the show was cancelled.  If you can, try and watch their swansong film ""Head"" (preferably the Criterion edition) before you take a look at the ""33 1/3"" special contained on the last disc.

The discs themselves are the same as the previous box sets, just a LOT cheaper and easier to put on a shelf.  I'm not crazy about the fake 5.1 mix.  However, the mono is perfectly clean and the image is quite sharp.  A must for any fan.",1323302400,7,2106,4.5638297872340425

1942998,4,B0000TAZW4,"It seems that I've been prefacing my Amazon reviews a lot lately by stating that Amazon has a dumb policy of grouping reviews of ALL releases of any video. If I film was released on VHS and later on DVD and then on Blu-ray, ALL the reviews appear on all products. So readers should always click on ""Newest First"" and look at date review is posted.

This is the case of this Complete Monkees Season TWO. The set was released on DVD yesterday by Eagle Rock Entertainment, and yet there are 35 reviews of it going back to 2003, when Rhino first released the six-disc set - in a package that looked like a record play and had a list price of about $89.95. The new set from Eagle Rock comes in a much more conservative foldout digipak and lists for $39.95. After watching much of this new set - and reading details of the prior Rhino release, it most definitely appears that this is just a re-packaging of the earlier set at a price reduction of about 50% - an a package that will be easier to store. All the bonus features are the ones listed for the earlier set. So, if you already own the earlier volume, there is no need to purchase this one. BUT...... if you didn't buy it because of the price, now's your chance.

I was never a huge fan of the show but did watch it occasionally, hoping that there would be lots of musical performances. But there weren't as I learned then and remembered as I watched these DVDs. Most of the music came during the ""romps"" (scenes where Monkees' hits would play in the background. There is an option to just watch the romps on this set (same as earlier one) and they rarely ran much over a minute each.

There is lots of bonus material here with multiple commentaries from the cast or directors.  And this set contains The TV special ""33 1/3 revolutions per Monkee"" And there are the vintage Kellogg's commercials. But the prints have not been newly remastered and the color quality does vary.

I was attracted to the set to see how much I remembered and to re-watch an episode I remembered well (well, pretty well) with guest star -local Philly DJ Jerry Blavat. It was nice to see again. And I've spent hours with this set already - as well as with Season One (see separate review), hitting the fast forward button only occasionally when things got a bit too ""silly""

I won't rehash comments from many of the reviews from 2003 because they pretty much remain the same. The Monkees were TV icons of the 1960s and have a very strong fan base. That base will want to own this set - again, if they don't have it already.

This classic deserves a new Blue-Ray transfer, color correction, and soundtrack cleanup.  The packaging may have been promotionally 'cute' when it came out; but with DVD storage space at a premium, a new release would be better served by a more modern package.  Could have used Woodstock's 'scratches in fine leather' quote.

Funny, charming, zany, cool.  Davey, Peter, Mike and Mickey were both comic actors and musicians.  While they became a serious band in their later days, this show had deep roots in comedy.  It was a simpler time, which is well reflected by the series.  Ah, those were the days.  The Monkees lead me to my very first guitar, a Sears Silvertone (Just like Glenn Campbell & Jimi Hendrix).

If you can only buy one set, I would buy season one, since the Monkees sort of lost interest toward the end of season two, and a few of the episodes suffer. I have sons who are 5 and 8 years old who love the Monkees, and they really enjoy both seasons of DVD's. I think the Monkee's are clean wholesome fun and definitely a pop culture icon worth exposing your kids to.

Micky, Davy, Mike and Peter ""make the world shine"" with offbeat romps such as ""The Devil and Peter Tork,"" ""Fairy Tale"" and ""The Frodis Caper."" The group's increased confidence and creative control resulted in some of their finest songs. ""Pleasant Valley Sunday,"" ""Goin' Down,"" ""Randy Scouse Git"" and ""Salesman"" are among the music-video highlights. Rhino's five-DVD set includes all 26 episodes plus the 1969 special ""33 1/3 Revolutions Per Monkee""  an uneven yet subversive pop-culture document with memorable appearances by Fats Domino, Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis. Contrary to popular belief, it was The Monkees' creative differences with NBC  not poor ratings  that ended the series. Dolenz, Jones, Nesmith and Tork should have agreed to a third season, since they partially won the battle to eliminate the sitcom format and were just hitting their stride as performers.

The bottom line is that these episodes are unavailable elsewhere on DVD as far as I know and I'm delighted to have them (although I prefer Season 1 overall). If someone produces some better versions, then fine, I'll buy them too!",1143936000,10,641,4.517241379310345
1943018,5,B0000TAZW4,"While I prefer more Monkees episodes from Season I, than from Season II, I figured I would cover this set because of the ""33 1/3 Revolutions Per Monkee"" (33.3 RPM) the 1 hour NBC special which aired in 1969 shortly after the Monkees show was cancelled. That is the highlight of this set, if you have not seen it before. 33.3 RPM is basically an extension of Head; meaning deconstructing in a scathing manner the crass commercialization of the successful Monkee machine. 33.3 RPM is overall a very distant piece exhibiting often times excessive hippiedom, but the DVD commentary by both Brian Auger and Micky Dolenz do make it more watchable.  33.3 RPM was a very strange special for its time. One of the greatest highlights of the special is seeing Fats Domino, Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard along with Brian Auger playing simultaneously on stacked pianos. It was the last time the Monkees appeared as a foursome on television for nearly 2 decades.

All 4 Monkees contribute DVD commentary to this set, whereas in Season I, when Dolenz was not available to add his crazy comments.  I found Nesmith's commentary the most interesting. Nesmith mentions details such as using very large film cameras nearly the size of ""VW bugs"" which were used in filming during the tail end of the Hollywood's Golden Years. Tork generally seemed bitter in his commentary and took long pauses at times.

There are a few easter eggs to be found. You can easily find these by googling the information. One Easter Egg is Butch Patrick talking about appearing on Monkees Christmas episode and befriending Peter.

Now my complaints about the DVDs themselves. Most of the episodes appear in very good shape despite the film approaching 40 years of age, but you have a few disappointments with image quality such as ""Monkees in Paris"" and ""Fairy Tale.""

The design of the DVD is you can play all the romps (footage set to music) on each disk, but you are not able to play all the episodes themselves at once. The DVD trivia notes by Aaron Handy and his website The Monkees Film & TV Vault.  I highly recommend a Monkees fan or a fan of amazing detailed trivia to go to his website to read more.  Another idea I wish Rhino had used is having the option of the selecting songs available to play on DVD that were changed out at later dates. As Monkees fans may or may not know, when the Monkees episodes were repeated in prime time, and later in syndication 1969-70, many songs were changed out. It would have been nice to chose from a menu which song was used, so one could watch them they way they were in later syndication use. The Monkees released 4 more albums after the show went off the air in September 1968. Some of this material, such as ""Midnight Train"" appeared on the repeat shows in 1970.

I wished also Rhino had added the entire appearance the 3 Monkees on the Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour: the very best part was left off The guys singing a medley of 3 of their songs and a perfoming an odd musical parody of American historical events.

I have read that a few people have had problems playing these DVDs on their players. I recommend cleaning the DVDs very thoroughly and or using a different player just to make sure there is no defect.

Pricing: I would seek out a used set and not pay more than $45 or $50 total for each set: Season II or Season I.  The retail price of a new set for around $80 is too high in my opinion.",1125619200,15,3416,4.509708737864078
1943019,4,B0000TAZW4,"While season 1 of ""The Monkees"" had a handful of episodes, it is season 2 that has a fresher, more genuine off-the-wall feel to it.

And, by the end of season 1, critics were complaining that the mnusic wasn't ""theirs"".  As a result of this and Mike Nesmith's subsequent prodding, the music used in this season was done BY the Monkees and not behind-the-scenes artists.  Many songs that even bested some of the ""legit"" music of the time, include ""Salesman"", ""For Pete's Sake"", ""Randy Scouse Git"", ""The Door into Summer"", ""Zor and Zam"", ""Daily Nightly"", ""Pleasant Valley Sunday"", ""You Just May Be The One"", ""You Told Me"", and there are many others...

The best episodes include:

* Monkees Marooned (Peter sells his guitar for a treasure map and, after being berated by the others is joined by the others to see what it's about.  The one liners in this one are great...)

* The Picture Frame (The group is conned into pulling a bank robbery by a ""producer"" who is actually a crook!)
* Monkee Mayor (Mike Nesmith runs for mayor in an attempt to drive out the corrupt incumbant.  One of my top 5.)
* Hillbilly Honeymoon (A spoof of The Beverly Hillbillies and ironically more realistic...  One of my top 5.)
* Fairy Tale (A surreal and outrageous spoof on old fairy tales; Mike also dresses up in drag and there's a lot of fun to be had here.  The lack of laugh track is also intriguing.  Another top 5.)
* The Devil and Peter Tork.  (A great plot, which contains one of their best-ever songs, almost banned by NBC because of a hidden drug reference (though the song is clearly AGAINST drugs...).  It's my absolute favorite.  (the 5th one being, of course, ""Monkee vs Machine"" but that's season 1...))
* Mijacogeo (aka ""The Frodis Caper"") - unusual social commentary about television, even if the story is written and directed in such a bizarre (and likely deliberate) manner by Mickey Dolenz himself.

As for the DVDs themselves:

Menu/layout:

A+++ for the menuing system.  I was impressed by the use of audio noise between the master and sub-menus, and the layout.  Very impressed indeed.

Trivia:

A nice addition with some interesting bits and pieces, along with guest cast filmography.

Video:

Colors look deep and saturated and flesh tones remarkably accurate from a filmed ~38 year old show.  As the show was filmed and not taped, that has led to

The prints seem reasonably sharp too.

There are some dust and other film-related issues, but that is unavoidable and I only know of one TV show whose restoration team actually removes by hand all signs of scratches and dust...

The only problem is DVD compression artifacting, which tends to make the picture seem a bit muddy; particularly with background/darker areas; they suffer the most from this artifacting.  It's not entirely bad, but bad enough for me to make a mention of.  :-)

Audio:

Sounds great but please stick to the standard Dolby 2.0 mono.  I tried out the 5.1 and maybe they thought the viewer ought to be on LSD while listening to the show.  The 5.1 produces a very bizarre sort of echo effect that makes everything difficult to understand.  And as I don't have this problem with any of my other 5.1 movies/shows, it must then be a problem with the encoding.  But the Dolby 2.0 is crisp and clean; like how it was originally, minus that wretched hiss.  :-)

In short, the MSRP is too high.  Buying it used or clearance would be a better choice; $80 for BOTH seasons is a much fairer price given the video quality and that bizarre 5.1 transfer (B+ for effort but they needn't have bothered to take this step.  I'd rather have better compression for the video.)

It's quite acceptable quality in the end, especially when compared to offerings from certain other vendors, who clearly don't put much time into their releases at all.",1123027200,45,3803,4.668674698795181

I actually enjoy the second season episodes to the first, but I was disappointed at the sound quality of the music. Rhino owns the original master to the Monkees recordings, and could easily have improved on the sound over the original 16mm prints, but unfortunately didn't. The music clips on most episodes sound muffled and distorted.  This is especially true for the ""Rainbow"" performances, the end-of-show music videos that feature the Monkees lip syncing to their songs. I didn't notice this on the audio of the first season shows. How hard would it have been to overdub the stereo recordings to these clips? On the plus side, the picture quality was generally excellent, and the inclusion of the rare 33 & 1/3 special (with very good audio) makes this worth recommending.

The shows in season 2 aren't as consistently innovative and clever as the first season product, but the music is superb (Daydream Believer, Pleasant Valley Sunday, Randy Scouse Git and all of Nesmith's country-pop contributions).

It has some commentaries on some of the episodes by each Monkee. Episode 48 has commentaries by Mike and Peter.  It was interesting to see the same show and hear 2 different points of view.  Bob Rafelson commented on the episode that he directed and it is about time we heard from the man who really created the Monkees.

The triva info on each DVD is GREAT, and the image & sound quality is pretty good. However, I'm not a fan of the commentary stuff (never have been). To a true Monkees fan, the season two box set is worth the money (in the $60 to $80 range).
As for the complaints about the video & sound quality... quit whining! Did you expect Rhino to hire ILM for several million dollars to clean everything up to absolute perfection? These things are only noticable if you are super nit picky & have a $5000 TV. To the rest of us with mid-range entertainment systems at home, the video & sound quality is just fine.

A group of guys thrown together based on the look and popularity of a particular generation.  Yes, they did have a unique sound, and a very popular TV show, but they should in no way be considered icons, or have their work be scrutinized by theater and drama critics.  I enjoyed the show and sound very much, but I was not even a teenager at the time!  The Monkees are not Led Zeppelin or Nirvana.  They are a ""cult classic"", like Rocky Horror...no more, no less.  Just enjoy the music and stop picking them and this release apart.  They were young men having fun.  Sex, drugs and rock n' roll was the motto at that time.  That should say it all.",1072137600,,787,4.27891156462585
1943027,3,B0000TAZW4,"First of all, let me state that this review does not concern itself with the content of the Monkees episodes.  I grew up with the show in 1970's syndication and love it.  I'm a big fan of both the show and the Monkees' music.
The axe I have to grind is not with the show, the music, or the (1960's) Monkees themselves.  Those aspects of the show get a 5-star rating from me.  (And if you are reading this, then I assume you are also a big fan.)  It's just that while Apple was able to wonderfully restore the Beatles' legacy in the ""Anthology"" DVD collection, Rhino chose not to do the same thing here...
My first problem is the fact that Rhino (or more precisely, AOL Time Warner, which bought Rhino in 1998) did not bother to spend any money to restore & clean up the audio or video of any of these episodes.  If you bought the mid-90's VHS box set and were expecting an audio & video upgrade, you're going to be in for a disappointment.  Rhino seems to have used the same video masters they used for the earlier collection (the 1994, 1995, & 1996 ""program content"" copyrights on the DVD boxes would support this theory).
The audio portions of each episode sound much softer than the title screens.  As a result, you have to crank the volume up when you watch an episode.  When the episode is finished, and you go back to the title screen (and forget to reset the volume), it's almost like being hit on the head when you are blasted by the *very* loud Monkee's Theme that will greet you there.  Granted, this is a minor annoyance, but after you are startled a number of times, it starts getting to you.
The video quality is also rather poor.  The episodes appear *very* dark and murky.  Lots of details cannot be seen as they have faded into the shadows.  The prints used for syndication were a bit edited in places, yet they had MUCH more vibrant colors and were not as dark as the prints Rhino used.  If you saw the show in the 1970's, then you should remember how much more colorful it looked at that time.
If you are lucky enough to own one of the early 1990's Japanese Laserdisc box sets, you'd know how much better those episodes look when compared to the ones released by Rhino.  The LD box only contained 40 of the 58 episodes, yet that's what I still reach for when I want to watch the show.
Now, let me direct my attention to the audio commentaries:
In a perfect world, all four of the Monkees would have done the commentaries together and they would have been complimentary to the producers who gave them the show, the fans who have supported it all of these years, and the other guys in the group.  In a less perfect world, they would have at least done a little fact-checking before they got behind the microphones.
It's sad to say that in the Monkees' world, none of this happened.  All four of the Monkees (with the exception of Davy, maybe) don't come off very well.  Their commentaries are short on anecdotes, and collectively, they appear to be rather dysfunctional.  I'd bet that paychecks were driving force behind a few of the commentaries, not out of respect for the fans or the show.
Micky comes off the worst.  He may have believed he was being cute and funny, but his rather obnoxious commentary is like a poor-man's version of MST3K.  He offers precious little insight into the episode he co-wrote and directed.  He is also quite blistering in his assessment of the 33 1/3 special.  It really seemed like he didn't want to do the commentary and he was carrying on just to prove a point.
Mike seems to show bemusement that the show was and continues to be popular.  He says the intelligence level of the show appeals to 9-year olds.  He can't seem to understand that adults like (and continue to watch) the show.  While he has mellowed in regards to his place in the Monkees' legacy, it still appears he feels the show was beneath him (and that its fans might be too).
Peter (or ""Former Monkee Peter Tork"" as he identifies himself at the start of each commentary) uses his commentaries as a platform to rip into Mike and (to a lesser extent) producer Rafelson.  Some of his Monkees' history is a bit faulty (like going on about how his song ""For Pete's Sake"" was edited onto the end of *first* season shows when the show was in syndication in the 70's - it wasn't).  Peter has replaced Mike as the group's curmudgeon.
Davy is the only Monkee who is gracious to the others, and who appreciates the fans who have kept the show going for all these years.  His commentary is light on the facts and anecdotes, but it's not mean, dismissive, or obnoxious.  He definitely comes off the best.
Conversely, the two non-Monkee commentaries here (by Bob Rafelson and Brian Auger) are the most informed and interesting.  Mr. Rafelson is very gracious to the group he created and he is very complimentary of the guys.  Mr. Auger shares some interesting insights about the 33 1/3 special and he never attacks it (unlike a certain Mr. Dolenz).  Both Rafelson & Auger enhance this collection, unlike the Monkees themselves.
So, unless AOL Time Warner / Rhino decides to spend the dough and really restore these classic TV episodes, then this rather disappointing collection is all we're going to get.  I recommend it for the inspired content it contains (the original episodes), not for its presentation.",1071273600,177,5314,4.501041666666667
1943028,4,B0000TAZW4,"Well here I am again keeping the British end up! I have loved the Monkees for at least 23 of my 26 years on this earth so heres my two pennies worth:
Good Bits About The Set:
They are all a lot more themselves and less cheesy.  I.e. Peter is more hippy and less dippy, Mike is more mardy and sarcastic and less strong and silent, Davy camps up his cheesy lines and is a bit more funky, less boy next door and Micky is as silly as ever - but even more!!! His hair says it all!!
I like the way they take the micky out of the stupid situations they are put into. I particularly like Wild Monkees and Some Like It Lukewarm. Speaking from my perspective (as a rag a bone and a hag of hair!) Davy looks particularly gorgeous and apart from Micky they all look loads more attractive in their more natural styles.
Ok so theres some bad bits ....
Sounds goes up and down, need more commentary - and more USEFUL comments I agree with a previous commenter that they don't have a great deal to say about the episodes (Fairy Tale commentary from Mike is the best). 33 and a third RPM is sooooo boring.  The one good bit is Mike singing Naked Persimmon and the rest looks like a hippies nightmare.  I wonder if these people were paid?
Still, as a die hard Monkees fan I have to like the series itself it and its in stark contrast to the first series.  Its a lot cooler but the cold sarcasm and unveiling of their situation only goes to put a nail in the coffin of The Monkees. There is a very samey feel to the episodes - why wasn't Mike ever in a romantic episode? Surely they didn't all fancy Davy - Mike is about 6""2 after all!!!
Ive rated this 4 stars because the Monkees have a special place in my past.  If they have that in yours then buy this.  If they don't laugh at a friends copy - may be best viewed after a few bottles of wine though!!

Also included in this box set is the television special 33 Revolutions per Monkee. All four Monkees hated 33 Revolutions per Monkee. Peter Tork called it a television version of Head. Davy Jones hate because the Monkees were reduced to second string and focused more on the guests. Though I will give Brian Auger a good review on his commentary on 33 Revolutions per Monkee. In the scene where (top from bottom) he, Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard and Fats Domino are playing the pianos that he was very nervous because of the vibration of the top organ not being steady. Also, right across from where 33 Revolutions per Monkee being tape, Elvis comeback special was being tape. Micky Dolenz gives a lack luster commentary.
