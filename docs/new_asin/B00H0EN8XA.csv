6125138,4,B00H0EN8XA,"Stunning ... Disturbing.... Captivating... Repulsive...Seductive.... A Tour de Force slice of the teeming underbelly of society. I watched this late at night, and it came off the screen so shocking at times I was tempted to stop it. However I was hooked/so captivated by the editing - acting - nuanced presentation... I could not force myself to do it.  It was like seeing a bad accident, but then driving by slowly to look at it. The acting.. where do they get these people??  Mr. Kinnaman -- flawless performance -- Fares Fares... I'll follow him anywhere.. I have to watch it again to enjoy what I didn't see.  It  was a thrill to watch danger/thugs/devil may care real people from the comforts of my own home.  As I would never in this world ever get to glimpse this life.  Thank You for the opportunity to help me count my blessings in my world.",1396310400,3,850,4.559210526315789
6125139,4,B00H0EN8XA,"Gosh, what can I say? I am now obsessed with Swedish films. They are expertly written, realistically shot and captivating. I got into this after seeing Joel Kinnaman in Robocop and had to see more of what this guy had to offer as an actor. He is BRILLIANT as usual and the story just gets better and better as people try to climb their way out of the seedy underbelly of Sweden and try to not get double crossed by doing so. MUST BUY!",1395446400,2,434,4.178571428571429
6125140,4,B00H0EN8XA,"One must first have seen the original before you invest the time in this movie.  With that said, I would recommend this film for those who enjoy a well told story.",1394236800,2,163,4.258064516129032
6125141,4,B00H0EN8XA,"When I attended a screening of EM/HtK, it was poorly attended. That may because of the blizzard that night, or it may have been because a popular on-line site of movie reviews gave it a mere 53% on their Lettuce meter. At the time, their highest rated film was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-LEGO-Movie/dp/B00IDI7WP2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The LEGO Movie</a>, and that, I think, explains this movie's poor reception in the US.

It's a famous truism among Hollywood producers that ""People don't go to the movies to get depressed,"" and Americans might've liked this movie more if, after all the mayhem, the female lead and the young desperado had ridden off into the sunset and were last seen walking down a beach at sunset and holding hands.

But for those of us who admire realism, not cartoon fantasy, this is an extraordinarily gripping movie. As Europe suffers through the effects of the IMF's austerity penance, unemployment among young people in some nations approaches 50%, and in such circumstances they turn to crime. This is the case not only in Madrid and Athens (and Detroit), but as people migrate north, everywhere, including Stockholm, where this movie is set.

Actor Joel Kinnaman's role is diminished from the first movie in the series, and it's also less interesting, but the rest of the cast more than makes up for this.

Ignore the Product Description given above, because it's wildly inaccurate.

  SPOILER ALERT   SPOILER ALERT   !

If you have not yet seen EM/HtK, please read no further.

The only false note in this grim movie is near the end, where the two sympathetic characters, Nadja, the young woman who has been forced into prostitution, and Jorge, the guy who begs his dead mother for forgiveness for all his misdeeds, fall in love but are tragically gunned down by a shotgun-wielding assassin from the mob.  Getting blasted by a 12-gauge at point-blank range would, in reality, have left her viscera splattered across the room, and when the guy takes a load of buckshot in the upper back, he miraculously does not go into shock or even cough blood. Instead, as they are wheeled into the ambulance, they smile and make dewy eyes at each other.

It's a mawkishly sentimental scene in an otherwise uncompromising movie.",1393718400,2,2300,5.112299465240642
6125142,5,B00H0EN8XA,"I completely don't mind the subtitles! The screenplay and actors WORK magic in this thriller!  Jorge has 13 lives, this guy is TRULY Hard to Kill.  Can't wait for the next episode in this saga.",1392508800,3,193,4.485714285714286
6125143,5,B00H0EN8XA,"Loved this movie.  This is the second movie to the swedish Easy Money trilogy.  The first movie was phenomenal, and i was not sure if the second would live up to it.  It's as good, if not better.  you are at the edge of your seat the whole time.  Many of the key characters from the first movie return, which is good.  It's just another must see - now i need to see the last one.",1427587200,,379,3.9210526315789473

6125145,2,B00H0EN8XA,"i am a big joel kinnaman fan but this movie isn't that great, i just don't believe it esp. the 2nd one I won't even bother with the third.  it all boils down to writing because there are clearly good actors in this film, esp. the spanish guy and the guy who plays the muslim.  its sad when you see a good cast of actors but the movie is crap because the writing is not that great.",1423180800,,380,3.9220779220779223
6125146,2,B00H0EN8XA,"Of the Easy Money films trilogy, this is the one to skip.  Pointless plot.  Doesn't add anything to the first move.  Save yourself the money and go immediately from the first film to the third.",1421193600,,193,4.457142857142857

6125149,4,B00H0EN8XA,"This is the follow up to the enormously successful `Easy Money'. It has the same actors and picks up where the first one left off - but the good news is you do not have to have seen part 1 in order to be able to follow this one, as everything is put into context. We meet J.W. who has been banged up for his past indiscretions and is reunited with Mrado; who despite his injuries being down to J.W. they have become friends. J.W. has spent his time in prison developing software that will earn him a bucket load of money and hopefully rehabilitate him with his former life.

We also have two stories running in parallel; that of Mahmoud, who is a small fry foot soldier, working for Mr Big - Radovan- who is a Serbian crime lord. And would be drugs trafficker Jorge, who seems to leave a trail of dead behind him wherever he goes.

Although they are all working on their own scams, fate has a hand that will conspire to ensure all their paths cross and the result will not be a happy one. This is a tale of drugs, prostitution, crime lords, violence and money laundering. The violence is gritty and often, but it all felt totally in place given the context of the film.

It is a full on adrenalin rush too with edge of seat action and jaw droppingly good camera work. Joel Kinnaman as J.W. does a superb job as does all the cast. This is in Swedish, Spanish, English, Serbian, Arabic and Croation with very good subtitles and a run time of 96 minutes. Another movie adapted from a novel by Jens Lapidus and another great film to add to the impressive list of Nordic Noir - absolutely recommended.",1405123200,5,1596,4.3133333333333335
6125150,3,B00H0EN8XA,I am saying that it is okay because I have to admit I was pretty confused some times as to what was being done and by whom (who?) I liked Joel Kinnaman and most of the rest of the cast but at a lot of times I was lost.  maybe it's me but I did try.,1403827200,,248,3.4285714285714284
6125151,5,B00H0EN8XA,"Good, solid acting. The story is fast paced, with lots of action.  I'd like to see another sequel in short order.",1400544000,,113,4.380952380952381
6125152,5,B00H0EN8XA,"I liked the first part of this trilogy very much, and the second part does not disappoint--it falls naturally with the action from Easy Money/Snabba Cash. The movie flows in dialogue, tension, and action. No slow spots, but very intense. It's a gritty, hard-boiled thriller will likeable characters. You'll need to see the first movie to get the plot. Joel Kinnaman is excellent in this, as a compelling character drawn into inevitable conflict. The movie touches upon class consciousness, betrayal, trust, social clashes, and helplessness of being unable to change one's fate.",1399939200,3,577,5.282608695652174
