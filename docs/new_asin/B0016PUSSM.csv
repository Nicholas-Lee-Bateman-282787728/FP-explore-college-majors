8263927,3,B0016PUSSM,"This DVD-10 from Lionsgate has two movies starring Mexican starlet Maria Felix: La Diosa Arrodillada(1947) and La Generala(1971). Maria Felix(1914-2002) was fetching and a decent actress, but she had a giant ego problem.

La Diosa Arrodillada/The Kneeling Goddess(1947): Antonio(Arturo De Cordova) cheats on his wife with Raquel(Maria Felix). The authorities suspect that Antonio murdered his wife.

La Generala(1971): Mariana(Felix) joins rebels after a Mexican soldier kills her brother in cold blood! This was Maria Felix's last movie! Innocent men, women, and children in this film are not spared! They are killed in gruesome, messy ways! The upbeat soap commercial filmed on the film's set sticks out like a sore thumb(that's like filming an M&M's TV spot on the set of Schindler's List!)

This DVD is for Maria Felix fans only!",1288742400,5,833,5.392307692307693
