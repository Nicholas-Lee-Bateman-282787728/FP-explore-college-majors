8277774,5,B001AJ18EC,trying to get more exercise and got this DVD to go along with a stationary bike. The video tempo is great and the scenery is beautiful.,1416614400,,135,4.230769230769231
8277775,5,B001AJ18EC,"Wow this is an enjoyable video!  Have never been to Mexico and this was a good experience of the sights and sounds!  A very colorful country; loved the cultural music, cycling among traffic, seeing pedestrians, shops and the mountains.  Simply loved this wonderful experience.  Hint: If you dim the lighting (as done in spinner classes) while viewing BOV dvd's, it helps you focus on the screen without distractions.  Seems more realistic.",1407456000,,439,5.126760563380282
8277776,5,B001AJ18EC,This is a ride I bought a couple years back with the original twenty-two videos on the Bike-O-Vision website and I still use it several times a month for a trip to Mexico. My husband and I have driven to Mexico by RV and this is the next best thing to a real trip and I can do it from the comfort of my home. The music goes along with the visuals and keeps up a good pace throughout. There are no cities with traffic and stop signs but there are many small towns and scenic rides through mountains and along the beaches. You have no doubt as to where you are. I recommend this ride for anyone who enjoys indoor cycling.,1343347200,,619,4.081967213114754
