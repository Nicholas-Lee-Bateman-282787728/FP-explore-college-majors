8236053,5,B000ZN8086,"N-Circle Entertainment is definitely one of my favorite DVD companies at the moment, and has been for quite a while. They have managed to bring back a lot of classic programs that aired back when I was much younger (I'm 20 years old now), and have been remarkably respectful of the original content by not altering//butchering/changing anything around or putting in their own little 'edits.' They left Heathcliff untouched on this DVD, and that's most certainly something that I respect. From the original opening sequence to the title cards to the content of each episode, nothing has been manipulated (and you can even see slight traces of film grain and deterioration on some of the footage, which lets you know that they got this straight from the original master tapes). I also like how the 1984 DiC Vortex logo appears on this DVD; unfortunately, if you choose to watch all of the episodes in a row, you won't see it until the last episode has ended. It doesn't come on after every episode, sadly enough. But it's there, which is more than enough for me. I also like how N-Circle had the decency to save the previews for the end of the DVD and not to bombard people with them at the beginning--clearly they've taken notes on how the best video companies of years long gone used to present their home entertainment. Overall, N-Circle is a great company, and they did an excellent job with this DVD. I may very well look into buying other Heathcliff DVDs in the future from them (if there are others)... that's how much they managed to impress me. You won't regret purchasing this if you decide to do so.",1361577600,,1608,4.6456140350877195
8236054,3,B000ZN8086,"First off I'm a big fan of cartoons and Heathcliff was one of my favorites as a kid, so I like to relive that era sometimes. That being said, I don't understand why cartoons don't get more respect especially when considering the way the releases/DVDs are packaged. Distributors always seem to package the old with the new and this one is no exception.

This DVD contains 5 Heathcliff cartoons, three of which can be found on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heathcliff-and-the-Catillac-Cats/dp/B000A345DA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heathcliff and the Catillac Cats</a>, and two I've not seen released before. The old: The Great Pussini, Rebel Without Claws, and Heathcliff's Middle Name; the new: Heathcliff Pumps Iron and Big Top Bungling.

So the long and short of it is that if you bought the 4 Disc set, like I did, you get two new cartoons with this DVD.

To distributors: stopping messing with us and just release complete sets of these cartoons or seasons like live-action TV shows. Other cartoons are doing it and it seems to work. With all the cable channels and new cartoons on TV now, I would guess most people buying these ""retro cartoons"" or in many cases cartoons from the 1980s, are adults who want to remember their childhood or share that memory with their own kids.

I hope they're listening.",1204934400,4,1352,5.24537037037037
