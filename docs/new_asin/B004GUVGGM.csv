8429018,5,B004GUVGGM,"Or more specifically, If you are a WWII history Buff with especial interest in the Ostfront
from the (mostly) German perspective, this film is a must buy. There's so much here you have
NOT seen elsewhere and in addition the video quality is superb. Obviously they can't exceed
the original sources but nevertheless you will be very pleased.

I suppose it must be admitted that ""World at War"" and the ""Battlefield Series"" remain the
standard by which others are judged. But once you've seen/owned these then what? Trolling along
through endless History Channel-type shows that re-hash what you've already seen? I enjoy
them too, but after a while you know the battles, the weapons, the units - In the absense of
any fresh historical narration or interpretation you just want more great footage. This DVD
will give it to you.

""Walter""(see review above)was correct in his criticism of this DVD's narration but it is really
no better or worse than any others. I think perhaps he was hoping for more considering the
high quality of the visuals. Also, if you are a history buff you should already have a Region
2-capable DVD player since even a cursory look at a Region Code Chart will make it obvious that
every single Axis nation (including Japan) is Region 2. Most important of all, it opens the door
to British and/or German DVDs which (mostly) have all the best productions. And while we're at it
I should ask that before you buy check out this Brit web-site that offers this DVD and many more:

Once you get there you will see many titles of, ""Germany at War"" series. DVDs such as this one are
pulled from the raw footage that is the Germany at War titles. There are at least around 17 or 18
titles floating around the net in the ""Germany at War"" series so there is a huge body of high
quality video out there you may never have seen. But narration is nice and titles like this one
are a good first intro to this massive collection of original WWII footage.

Bottom line? Buy from Amazon if you can, especially in the States as Royal Mail costs an arm and
a leg to ship anything ""across the pond."". Don't expect another ""World at War"" with Sir Larry's
brilliant narration. But do stand by to enjoy some superb eye-candy, especially the German side
of things. Five Stars.",1371513600,2,2354,4.748166259168704
8429019,5,B004GUVGGM,"I have a deep interest in Barbarossa and this DVD fills a gap in my historical holdings. I recommend this DVD to anyone who has an interest in World War II, and specifically the German invasion of Russia.",1364515200,,204,4.394736842105263
8429020,5,B004GUVGGM,"This a video put together by a British outfit.  They use German WWII film.  It is only about 55 minutes long and is way too short.  In that 55 minutes, it is excellent and the narration is not, the usual, guilt and sermonizing naration, that one gets too often with this kind of film.  They should have placed some more battle sequences into this film. That is small drawback.  It is definitely worth having and watching, if you are interested in the subject.  The DVD is in European format and you need a DVD player that will accept that format.  Most of the new DVD players will accomondate this format.  But check first.",1346716800,,623,4.451327433628318
