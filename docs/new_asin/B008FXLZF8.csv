5158710,5,B008FXLZF8,"I have to be honest and say that even though we're big VeggieTales fans around here, we had never watched 3 2 1 Penguins! before we received this dvd. We found ourselves laughing at the crazy, wacky antics of the penguins. Yes, some parts were a little cheesy, but that's part of the draw of some of these characters. Each story focused on one key lesson that was learned by Michelle and/or Jason. Obviously, the penguins and the other characters in the story were learning the lesson right along with Michelle and Jason because the entire episode was designed to incorporate those Biblical lessons into them. Since Michelle and Jason are at their Grama's house, she also plays a role in getting the kids to learn their lessons. She shares the Bible verses with the kids to help them understand how it all fits together.

If you're looking for a zany cartoon that your kids will enjoy and receive a good message, this series could be for you. It's nice to see a fun cartoon that teaches kids solid Biblical lessons.

5158711,5,B008FXLZF8,"We watched this when my two oldest were a little younger, but when we got this DVD, it was the first time my six and four year old sons had ever watched it, and they've been fascinated. My older two sons remembered this show from when they were younger, and entertained the little ones by singing along with the theme song and quoting the silly penguins. The bigger boys picked up on a few of the jokes they didn't catch when they were younger, and my twelve year old said, ""Mom, I forgot how cool this show is!"" Of course, you may never get him to admit it to his friends, but he still likes it.",1349308800,,596,4.146551724137931
5158712,5,B008FXLZF8,"3-2-1 Penguins is a wonderful series we really enjoyed watching on DVD.  The wacky penguins provide just the right amount of humor while Michelle and Jason are heroes my children can relate to. We laughed out loud at their silly activities all while learning life lessons such as sharing, not lying, not complaining and much more!

Each episode is the perfect length.  I was even able to sit through and enjoy 3-2-1 Penguins!

5158713,5,B008FXLZF8,I am so glad this series is finally being put onto DVD. These are great shows with a good moral lesson - and my kids (2-13) loved watching them when they were on Saturday mornings a few years ago. We are very happy to have this set as part of our DVD collection at home!,1347926400,,270,3.9272727272727272
5158714,5,B008FXLZF8,"My kids have loved the Madagascar Penguins from the first time that they saw the first Madagascar movie. They had not really seen this series until now and when they watched it they were just glued to the television. They laughed so much, but also, as I was watching too, I have to say that I really liked many of the messages that the show shares with people that watch. This was a great DVD set and if you like humor, and some great penguin antics, then this DVD set is for you!",1347235200,,480,4.172043010752688
5158715,5,B008FXLZF8,"My kids are big fans of Madgascar's penguin quartet, but I've never been a big fan of the crass behavior that is associated with those penguins. I remembered the penguins that Big Idea had introduced back in 2000 {after my cartoon days} and wished that my kids could enjoy those penguins instead - ones that would encourage them to be kind to one another and live according to the way God wants us to live. My kids LOVE 3-2-1 Penguins!, and I love it too! The brother-sister duo of Jason and Michelle are a perfect example for my kids to learn from about doing life with a sibling, and the quartet of penguins brings in a level of humor that entertains while teaching truth.

5158731,3,B008FXLZF8,"As others said, It is ridiculous that they randomized the episodes rather than leaving them in order, because the story over the season does actually progress.

We noticed a few times that they cut out parts of the series. It looks like the first 45 minute episodes were cut down for TV then used those for this DVD rather than using the original full length versions. It takes a lot of the fun away from the original episodes.

So even though this was cheap, and the kids really like watching it, I'd rather see them re-release the DVD with the full episodes and with them in order. I'd probably buy it again just for those improvements.",1390262400,3,638,4.491379310344827

5158735,5,B008FXLZF8,This is a great set for children of all ages. I saw these while volunteering at my church's bible camp and they were quite entertaining so a large spectrum of kids.

5158742,4,B008FXLZF8,"I agree with everyone who said they cut out parts of the 3 straight to DVD release episodes, which were Trouble On Planet Wait Your Turn, Cheating Scales of Bullamanka, and The Amazing Carnival of Complaining. If you didn't watch these episodes from their original DVDs, then you would really be confused by some of the editing they did. I wish they would come out with the rest of the episodes. Wikipedia says they have 27 episodes, but with all the DVDs they have out, including the 3 episodes that weren't released on their own DVD but are on this one, the total amount of episodes would be 18.  So they need to put the other 9 on DVD! I hope they do that soon!",1356134400,5,664,4.312

 As its a great way to help show & teach cognitively delayed children, who learn best via visual example, the difference between right and wrong.
 In addition, there are great lessons of cheating, learning to be compassionate and pride (just to name a few).
The lessons are also linked to a Bible verse by Bob & Larry's computer .
