8081173,3,B000AYYVDI,"A heart-warming story about friendship where one of the friends would really rather hang out with that guy who beat him up for being gay after they had sex. So, yeah, you might find it depressing instead.

I didn't think it was laugh-out-loud funny, but it had a lot of dark, absurd little twists. It gets to a happy ending, but unlike some movies where the happiness seems grafted onto a movie that was going in a much darker direction, this movie holds a convincing mix of hope and resignation throughout. Oh, and it's about 75 minutes--not long enough to get tiresome.

Overall, it's a clever satire but definitely not a must-see.",1288396800,5,633,4.642857142857143
8081174,5,B000AYYVDI,"Not going to lie; I watched this because it had Wil Wheaton in it.  I was not at all disappointed that he only appeared in one scene.  Damion Dietz and Stephanie Kirchen (Stephanie Orff) are outrageously hysterical.  The movie is non-stop, laugh out loud funny for the entire 75 minutes.  Calling Fag Hag politically incorrect would be outright slanderous.  This goes way beyond politically incorrect and knocks on the door of John Waters's side of the universe.",1284854400,5,462,4.9480519480519485
8081175,5,B000AYYVDI,"This movie is absolute genius on a student film budget. The writing is amazing and the performances are horribly spot on. I watched it once by myself and then when my boyfriend got home, I watched it all over again, laughing even harder the second time. If you don't like absurdist comedies, you will not like it. If you watch it, give it at least 15 minutes before you decide you don't like it. Once the rhythm of the movie gets going, it is unstoppable. If you think the idea of an HIV-positive, motivational rapper named T-Cell is funny, then you might like this movie.",1208131200,5,572,4.457142857142857
8081176,3,B000AYYVDI,"Okay so its not like the movie was totally horrible. It just lacked that extra umph that it needed to gain my attention. Its really bad that Will Wheaton is the first actor listed in the movie considering that he appeared in one scene only with limited lines. I don't care if he was friends with the writer/director, he should have played the main male role no matter what. It did have its moments though when I was just on the floor laughing about the lines that they gave these people. The quality is a little ""home movie"" but if your extremely bored and don't mind wasting some time in your life to see this then get the stale popcorn and enjoy.",1200009600,2,648,4.319672131147541
8081177,3,B000AYYVDI,"I bought this movie with my friend the night we got Harry Potter. We love campy movies, and it was inexpensive. This is probably the weirdest movie I have ever seen. To start, I should mention I haven't been able to finish it yet. I can only handle it in small doses before I go out of my mind, but its not actually a bad movie. Upon reflection it is hilarious- but it can be a little hard to sit through. If you have the money to spare and are up for a weirdddd movie, I would recommend it, if only because I doubt there is one other movie out there like it...

it's more of an experience than a movie.",1192147200,2,603,3.9834710743801653
8081178,4,B000AYYVDI,"This film isn't for everybody, but a select audience will find it hysterical.  Production values are poor, but in this case, that is part of its charm.  I tend to dislike alot of these independent films, but this is one I'll have to watch again.  The dialogue is soooo funny, and the songs are outrageous.  It makes me think a little of ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"", in that the story is outrageous and silly, and meant to be just that.  The characters are such losers, but you can't help but love them.  Again, this isn't for everyone, but if you liked ""Rocky Horror"", you might just get a kick out of this.",1136764800,4,607,4.375
