Starts with past wars, then shows basic training of men and women during WW2, then moves on to the various specialties within the Army.  Consequently,  it also acts as a recruitment film for blacks thinking about joining up.",1396828800,,333,4.910714285714286

7903189,5,B000003O58,"Produced by the War Department in 1944, The Negro Soldier is a very interesting documentary honoring African-American soldiers.  World War II was ongoing at the time, and the film may well have served to some degree as a recruitment vehicle for young black men, but it stands most clearly today as an historical piece and an inspiring, patriotic celebration of the American spirit and the critical importance of African-Americans in establishing and preserving the American way of life.  I was expecting to see some kind of visual record of African-American soldiers involved in fighting World War II, but the video actually serves as a primer of sorts for African-American soldiering throughout the entire history of the United States.  Using official War Department films, newsreels, and captured enemy material in conjunction with footage from historical movies and recreations of actual incidents and events, The Negro Soldier is an impressive albeit rose-colored presentation of an oftentimes neglected subject.
The content of the film, which runs for forty minutes, is presented in a most interesting way, as it is narrated by a minister in an African-American church.  Seeing several soldiers among the congregation, the minister decides to forego his planned sermon and speak to the importance of the war effort.  Strangely enough, he has a copy of Mein Kampf with him and reads several pertinent passages as part of his introduction to the subject at hand.  He first points to a number of important African-Americans in each of America's wars, starting with the Revolutionary War and working his way up to World War II, while we are treated to a montage of videos illustrating the stories of such men as he describes.  The minister then takes time to praise the role of African-Americans in the building and continuing prosperity of the country and its infrastructure.  At one point, a woman in the congregation gets up and reads a letter from her son, who has just been made a lieutenant; to the backdrop of this letter, we are taken through the boot camp experience to see the making of a soldier.  In closing, the minister speaks to the current war effort itself, and the film closes with a medley of patriotic songs.  The Negro Soldier portrays military service as a challenge but one that offers nothing but benefit and reward to those who don the uniform.  While it foregoes any mention of hardship for African-Americans in ""this man's army,"" it does offer an inspiring and historically significant look at a somewhat neglected aspect of American military history.",1063670400,7,2579,5.073286052009457
7903190,4,B000003O58,"The late African American filmmaker and educator Carlton Moss wrote the script and plays one of the roles in this film used to promote nationalism among new soldiers. It provides a rare glimpse of the middle class African American experience of the time.
Moss plays a minister giving a sermon, which acts as the centerpiece for this film. He speaks about the noble history of African Americans in the United States on and off the battlefield.  Intercut with his sermon is footage of a soldier going through basic training along with historical footage highlighting black achievement.
While by no means an exciting film, it is quite honorable and provides a welcome alternative to the often stereotypical and negative portrayals of people of color in Hollywood films of the era. It should be required viewing in schools and a welcome addition to any family's video collection.",1015545600,8,875,5.0344827586206895
