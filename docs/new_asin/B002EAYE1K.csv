8367251,3,B002EAYE1K,The movie tries to be funnier than it is. It wasn't very fun to watch and I didn't really enjoy it in the long run. It felt really convoluted and was really trying to hard on every level because it didn't have the best story line. By the end I was glad when it was over. I will add a disclaimer that I've been watching old movies since I was little so I am not just looking at it from a perspective that comes with youth being exposed to more complex films of our present time. There are so many better romantic comedies from times past than this one. Verdict: pass.,1466640000,,566,4.108108108108108
8367252,3,B002EAYE1K,"I enjoyed the movie, mainly to see Ronald Reagan again. I definitely miss him. Unlike our current president, he actually loved America.",1419120000,6,135,5.181818181818182
8367253,4,B002EAYE1K,I love the cast of this movies both of the starts are great in this story. I recommend this movie!,1366243200,,98,3.95
8367254,5,B002EAYE1K,This movie is a classic example of a post war-time screwball comedy.  The cast's comic timing is perfect.  Definitely an overlooked silver screen gem!,1356393600,,150,5.208333333333333
8367255,5,B002EAYE1K,"I liked it! Reagan and Neal are fun. Reagan plays it straight to Neal's high strung bride-to-be, which gives the rest of the cast the chance to shine in broader, comedic parts. At the same time, the allusions to post-War hardships that are taken in passing (and would have been commonplace at the time) really reflect conditions of the era - in more realistic ways than equally charming comedies of the day (ie. the Bette Davis classic June Bride). Jack Carson is perfect as Jack Carson, as is Edward Arnold as the cranky senator.",1295654400,6,530,4.648936170212766
8367256,3,B002EAYE1K,"This is a film adaptation of a successful Broadway Play. It is Patricia Neal's first film. Ronald Regan does his usual low key performance. Wayne Morris is vey funny as well as is Jack Carson as Ronald Regan's ex-army buddy. The scene where Jack Carson in civilian clothes takes over for Wayne Morris announcing immediate seating in the balcony of New York's Strand Theatre is very funny especially for those of us that remember the announcements from the uniformed staff in the movie palaces. The very fine actor Edward Arnold who plays comedy equally as well as drama is excellent as Patricia Neal's father. Paul Harvey as the army general is also very good in his role as a pompous autocratic general. I waited a long time to see this film on DVD and the wait was woth it. The only thing in this DVD is that the selcted scenes are not indexed and one has to go through 10 minute segments to get to the desired scene.
