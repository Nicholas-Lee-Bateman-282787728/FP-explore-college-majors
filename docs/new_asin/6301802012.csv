The film picks up where the first ended and runs from there.  Henry Fonda is simply great as the slow talking but extremely wily Frank James.  much of the cast carries over into this sequel with is seamless in production.  It was very well written and beautifully filmed.  This is a good one to watch.  Better yet,  get both and watch them together.  It will be a hoot.",1154390400,24,502,4.145833333333333
370588,4,6301802012,"Frank James learns his infamous outlaw brother Jesse has been shot dead in the back by the cowardly Ford brothers. The peaceable and laconic Frank at first doesn't seek revenge, deciding instead to leave the killers' capture and punishment to the law. Bob and Charlie Ford are summarily caught and found guilty, but are pardoned immediately by the governor. So Frank picks up his guns and goes a-hunting for the murdering varmints. The film follows his relentless quest to bring his brother's murderers to justice. Along the way, he fends for his foolhardy young charge Clem and strikes a friendship with the beautiful Eleanor Stone, would-be reporter of the Star. After a lot of absorbing exposition and some action, the film culminates in the spirited trial of Frank James, on charges of murder and robbery.

The quite mythical story of the James brothers is comprised of two excellent films: Jesse James (1938) and The Return of Frank James (1939). In Jesse James, Tyrone Power does a fiery, charismatic turn as the lead character, eschewing the feared outlaw persona and remaking him instead into a misunderstood folk hero. Lanky Henry Fonda adeptly plays his more level-headed brother, Frank. Reviews must have been good for Fonda because he merits his own sequel here. Fonda's calm, thoughtful, folksy persona is in full evidence, his acting as reliably good as ever. The sequence where Frank shows up at a play showcasing the Fords' interpretation of Jesse James' death is a gem. The look on Fonda's face as this travesty was being re-enacted by the Ford brothers themselves is chilling and displays prominently his ability to plumb the depths of a darker, more bleak persona. Gene Tierney, in her first movie, is fresh-faced and eager, and is loveliness personified. I only wish that a romance would've blossomed between her Eleanor Stone and Frank James. But, apparently, the studio feared a lawsuit by Frank's widow or son. A mention must be made of John Carradine, who makes an aptly despicable Bob Ford, the dirty rat.

This classic western, ably directed by Fritz Lang, may be too leisurely at times for die-hard, shoot-em-up fans. Where gunfire is usually exchanged, we have instead an investment in story and character. But, of course, good stories and characters are synonymous with the iconic Henry Fonda.",1151193600,11,2322,5.0285714285714285
370589,3,6301802012,"Jesse James's brother avenges his murder. Producer Daryl F. Zanuck shocked the Hollywood community when he chose, off all people, Fritz Lang, the German director to make this sequel to the immensely popular 1939 film JESSE JAMES. It was a mixed bouquet of wild flowers: moody, at times too cutesy but very nicely photographed. Otis Ferguson once quipped: ""I doubt if any character was ever as lily white as that of Frank James here, but that is a present form the Hays Office to you, and anyway the part is played by Henry Fonda. Durn if I don't like that boy"". Cooper and especially John Carradine are fine in their performances. Hull's hammy playings is shown to advantage here, and Gene Tierney, although beautiful here, she clearly is not in her element as Eleanor Stone. Though Lang studied the American west by traveling and actually living among Navaho Indians, the whitewashed script defeats the director's attempt at successfully filming the destructive consequences of revenge. Henry Fonda was not wanting to work with Lang again after his tyrannical behaviour during the making of YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE three year priorly. When Lang promised to change his attitude, Hank relented. Bad mistake. The same fire exploded on the set and Fonda never worked with Lang again.",1036972800,9,1275,4.962616822429907
370590,5,6301802012,"This movie is much better than what the other reviewers would have you believe. While it is a sequel, it stands on its own as sort of a revenge flick with Frank (Henry Fonda) terrorizing and delivering retribution to John Carradine's Robert Ford, the man who shot Jesse James.  It is also the screen debut of the beautiful Gene Tierney. Compared to the special effects laden trash spewn out by Hollywood today, this has excellent characterization, excellent plot and excellent acting. It is definitely worth the price of admission.  Fritz Lang did a great job of depicting his vision of the Old West and while it may not be the greatest Lang film such as his 1931 classic, M, it is still a classic nonetheless.",1019692800,19,710,4.672

370668,5,6301802012,"It is unbelievabel that such an excellent color Western movie could have been made in 1940. I happen to have this as a Video released by Playhouse Video in1986 and the sound ,picture and color quality is excellent. Not much point in me elaborating on the storyline as it is simply that Frank James meets out revenge on the Ford brothers who killed Frank's brother James,and now intend to murder Frank as well. Henry Fonda has the lead role and he plays it magnificently. I don't have any idea how popular Gene Tierney was at the time this movie was made but she has always been one of my favorite actresses. This was her debut  appearance. I can remember during my High School years in the early 50's watching her in movies. She had the most beautiful eyes that I had, and still have, ever seen. She plays a great role in this movie,but if you pay attention to her beautiful dreamy blue eyes;I am sure that you will agree with me.
 There have been one or two Westerns released every year these days and get lots of promotion,,but they pale in comparison to the great westerns that flooded the screens back in the 40's to the 60's. Thank goodness that at least we have had those fantastic Sphagetti Westerns from Sergi Leone and Clint Eastwood.

370669,3,6301802012,"The 1940 western The Return of Frank James is a film Fritz Lang had to, rather than wanted to, make. Since his arrival in the US he had made three films for three different studios and all had not done well at the box office. Fury (MGM, 1936), You Only Live Once (United Artists, 1937) and You and Me (Paramount, 1938) had garnered Lang a reputation as a dark, cynical, negative Austro-German type who not only made box office poison (especially You and Me), but also drove everyone in the Hollywood system up the wall with his tyrannical dictatorial behaviour, especially on set. He failed to understand that whereas in Germany he had total control over every aspect of a film's production and could drive everyone to their limits, in Hollywood he had to contend with studio regulations, union rules and the power of stars. His power was confounded at almost every level and in 1940 studios didn't know what to do with him. The fact that over time Fury and (especially) You Only Live Once have been reassessed as classics did nothing for Lang at the time. So 20th Century Fox had a dilemma on their hands. Zanuck's answer was to give his monocled little Hitler a couple of westerns to cool him down and make him conform. And conform he did. Both The Return of Frank James and Western Union are as conformist as Lang ever got. The lack of personal involvement from Lang (he was brought in with cast and script already in place for both pictures) means there is nothing really to distinguish them from any other western made at the time. To talk about them at all as 'Lang' pictures seems pointless.

The Return of Frank James is a sequel to Henry King's 1939 Jesse James and is a simple revenge western with Frank (Henry Fonda) taking the law into his own hands when Bob and Charlie Ford (John Carradine and Charles Tannen) are let off by the jury at their trial for killing Jesse. With Jesse's son (Jackie Cooper) in tow Frank sets off across America in pursuit of his quarries. The love interest is provided by Gene Tierney in her first role as reporter Eleanor Stone who falls for our hero. Don't look for historical accuracy here as there isn't any. What there is are a collection of routine action sequences and some stunning landscape photography by George Barnes. This was Lang's first film in color and he does make use of it with some marvelously framed compositions, though how much this was Lang and how much was Barnes is a moot point. The film is an entertaining watch. The leads (especially Fonda and Tierney) play well and the story is diverting, but the film never really rises above mediocrity. See Drums Along the Mohawk (John Ford, 1939) or Dodge City (Michael Curtiz, 1939) for color westerns of the time which really blow your socks off. If it's revenge westerns you want then Winchester '73 (Anthony Mann, 1950) and The Searchers (John Ford, 1956) remain the benchmarks.

Murder, hate and revenge were usually meat and drink for Lang (think Die Nibelungen!), but clearly at this delicate point of his career he knew he had to toe the studio line, be nice to 'big star' Henry Fonda (who hated Lang for his treatment while making You Only Live Once) and wait for his chance which duly came the following year with Man Hunt. That proved to be his biggest ever American box office success and gave him the kudos to go on to make the wonderful The Woman in the Window (1944) and Scarlet Street (1945), before blowing it again with Secret Beyond the Door (1948). This DVD is a region 1 NTSC disc released by Fox themselves and looks and sounds absolutely fabulous. It's a shame the film can't match the presentation!",1411430400,,3632,4.594761171032357
370670,2,6301802012,"A sequel to ""Jesse James"" in which Fonda had played Frank Ford, the only ""action"" comes from Henry Hull overacting in an extended courtroom scene. Poorly plotted, slow, and dull, with unpleasant racist elements, this movie has to be rated as one of Fonda's and
Fritz Lang's (director) worst  films.  Fonda's character chases the murderers of Jesse, but their demises are not due directly to him.  The strictures of the code seem to have precluded the hero from shooting, let alone killing, anybody.  One of the Ford brothers falls off a cliff, and John Caradine (as a very cowardly Robert Ford) is killed by Jackie Cooper (of all people). Cooper ""pays"" for the killing by being shot and dying himself. Cooper was a cute child and a pleasant adult actor, but as a teenager, he was obnoxiously whinny and pouty.

This is one of those movies that follows history closely. Granted there some liberties taken but the story never drags.. It moves at a pretty rapid rate. Even at that time the Railroads were very powerful. They were also corrupt as were the politicians of that time. I found this movie entertaining and truthful. My only thought while watching this was we are living in a time of Grabbing, Lying,  cheating, and stealing, so people can get what they want.. The Politicians are the same today as they were back then.  In History Frank James Tried to stop the corruption but it is still with us today, only because the greater portion of Americans won't stand up and be counted.",1385164800,3,838,4.58
370717,4,6301802012,"As has happened so often in the past, this reviewer was introduced to this movie by watching a snippet on Turner Classic Movies. ""The Return of Frank James"" is a real sleeper and pleasant surprise. RFJ is a sequel to the 1939 success of ""Jesse James"" with Tyrone Power.  Now he will wish to see that one too!

Many of the players from JJ are back, albeit with Fritz Lang replacing Henry King at the helm. When Jesse is murdered at the outset, brother Frank (Henry Fonda) has to strap on his pistols, forget about being a gentleman farmer and go after the owlhoots who did in his brother.  Most of the action flows nicely with some very entertaining sidebars. The work of the supporting cast is very credible, especially Donald Meek playing a hounding railroad detective with a penchant for showing up everywhere. The trial of Frank for murder and robbery is well handled. George Barbier, as the trial judge is outstanding.  Does Fonda get his revenge and live happily ever after? No plot give aways here-folks will just have to watch the movie to find that out but will be happy they did. Viewers may wish to contrast HF's vengeful Frank James with his vindictive Wyatt Earp of ""My Darling Clementine"", filmed six years later.

Special mention goes to 20 year old Gene Tierney, in her Hollywood debut. Talk about a little scene stealer-she almost walks off with the entire picture! After that fadeout did Frank go back to his farm in Missouri or follow that beautiful young woman to Denver? The studio apparently had to avoid that subject to head off a lawsuit from the real life James family. Sad...we'll never know.",1375574400,2,1617,4.659649122807018

Directed by Fritz Lang

This Technicolor sequel to Jesse James (1939) does without the services of the earlier film's star Tyrone Power, who after all was shot dead by that ""dirty little coward"" Bob Ford (John Carradine). Repeating his portrayal of western outlaw Frank James is Henry Fonda who has retired from his life of crime to become a peaceful farmer, though he has never given up his search for the treacherous Ford. The killer and his cohorts are eventually rounded up, but are pardoned due to political intervention. That's when Frank slaps on six-guns once more to seek his own form of justice. Featured in the cast is Henry Hull as Major Rufus Cobb, a crusading newspaperman and Jackie Cooper is Clem, the headstrong young sprout whom Frank has taken under his wing. Making her screen debut is Gene Tierney as Eleanor Stone a reporter from the East who wants to tell Frank's true story to the world.

Special footnote: ~ The studio bought the rights to the James Brothers but changed the facts for entertainment. Although Frank surrendered 6 months after Jesse James' murder, both Ford brothers were already dead and Frank had nothing to do with their deaths ~ The original treatment had Frank romantically interested in the reporter played by Gene Tierney, but the studio became fearful of a possible lawsuit by Frank's widow and/or son, so it was eliminated from the script.

370755,2,6301802012,"Among western icons, Jesse and Frank James have fared most poorly in their cinematic representations. Pat Garrett (James Coburn) and Billy the Kid (Kris Kristopherson), Wyatt Earp (Hugh O'Brien, Kurt Russel) and Doc Holiday (Val Kilmer), Davey Crockett (John Wayne, Fess Parker), George Custer (Errol Flynn) all have been well portrayed, but, alas, the most famous personality of all, Jesse and his Brother Frank, have not been as successful.

""The Return of Frank James"" (1940) does nothing to change this. Henry Fonda reprises his role as Frank from the 1939 film ""Jesse James"". The sequel was made because ""Jesse James"" was a smash hit, grossing just less than GWTW, ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""The Hunchback of Norte Dame"". Considering what a great year 1939 was for films, coming in # 4 is saying something, and what is said, was SEQUEL. The only problem was Jesse (played by Tyrone Power) died at the end of the film.

Many of the people from"" Jesse James"" are in the Frank James film. Besides Fonda, we have Henry Hull (Major Cobb), John Carradine (Bob Ford), Charles Tannen (Charlie Ford), and Donald Meek (McCoy). The current film adds beautiful Gene Tierney (1920-91) as Frank's love interest and young Jackie Cooper as his side kick.

IMHO Henry Fonda's performance is weak. Fonda (1905-82) is, of course one of the greatest American actors of the 20th century. He was nominated for an Oscar3 times (""Grapes of Wrath"", ""12 Angry Men"") and won once (""On Golden Pond""). In his 100+ films he gave memorable performances in too many to list. But he was also capable of weak performances, and this is one of them. Perhaps the cause is director Fritz Lang's view of the conflicted hero which doesn't match the facts of Frank James' life.  Or perhaps Fonda simply wasn't able to play a cowboy effectively. Many great actors were unsuccessful as cowboys (e.g., Cagney, Bogart, Tracey).

This was Gene Tierney's film debut. Tierney was nominated for an Oscar for ""Leave Her to Heaven"" (1944) and appeared in more than 40 films, the most notable of which were ""Tobacco Road"" (1941), ""Laura"" (1944), ""Razor's Edge"" (1946), and ""The Left Hand of God"" (1955). She was known for her escapades with famous personalities like Tyrone Power, Ally Kahn, and JFK. When she saw herself on screen in this film, Tierney was disturbed by the sound and quality of her voice, and I have to agree. But with beauty as she possessed, who is listening?

Jackie Cooper (1922) started acting at age 3 and by the time he was 9 and appeared in ""The Champ"" he had been in 19 films, mostly shorts. His appearance in ""Skippy"" (1931) earned him a nomination as Best Actor (he lost to Lionel Barrymore), his first and only nomination, and following the success of ""The Champ"" he had a solid career as a child star, appearing in several films with Beery (""The Bowery"", ""Treasure Island""). He was 18 when this film was made. Cooper is one of the few major child stars who went on to have a successful career as an adult actor. In addition, he had a busy career as a TV director. Cooper does a good job.

John Carradine (1906-88) was a terrific character actor. He was a part of John Ford's Stock Company and gave memorable performances in ""Prisoner of Shark Island"" (1936), ""Stagecoach"" (1939) and ""The Grapes of Wrath"" (1940). He's best known to us today for his continuing role as Serenity Johnson in son David's TV series ""Kung Fu"" (1972-1975). Carradine doesn't get much chance to act in this film, but the key scenes in the film do revolve around his presence.

Henry Hull (1890-1977) appeared in more than 100 films. You recognize his husky voice and his hyperactive demeanor from such familiar films as ""High Sierra"" (1941), ""Lifeboat"" (1944), and ""Objective Burma"" (1945), but he's best known as the ""Werewolf of London"" (1935). He steals every scene he is in.

Donald Meek (1878-1946) was a short, crumpled, bald man who appeared in more than 100 films between 1923 and 1947. He was usually a villain. He had memorable roles in ""Captain Blood"" (1935), ""Adventures of Tom Sawyer"" (1938), and ""Young Mr. Lincoln"" (1939). I remember him best as the whiskey salesman from ""Stagecoach"" (1939) and as Mr. Poppins from ""You Can't Take it With You"" (1938).

The main interest of this film is that it was directed by Fritz Lang (1890-1976). Lang was  the father of film noir and was called the ""Master of Darkness"" by the BFI. He popularized the German school of expressionist film, with  the ""Dr. Mabuse"" series (1922, 1933, 1960), the revolutionary ""Metropolis"" (1927) and the frightening ""M"" (1931) which launched the career of Peter Lorre. Though he wasn't a Jew, Lang fled German in 1934 when the Nazis took over. He eventually came to the US where he made ""Fury"" (1936) and then this film. Lang went on to make such memorable films as ""Hangman Also Die"" (1943), ""The Woman in the Window"" (1944), ""Scarlet Street"" (1945), ""Clash by Night"" (1952), and ""The Big Heat"" (1953). While he was never nominated for an Oscar, his work influenced the work of many directors, including Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock.

Apart from the darkness and lots of shadows in a few scenes, there is little to distinguish this as a Fritz Lang film. Rather than bring something new to the western, Lang seems to have tried to make as standard a western as he could. Years later, with ""Rancho Notorious"", he would take more liberties, but this film is undistinguished. Which isn't to say the film does not have its occasional moments - there is a raucous courtroom scene with Henry Hull that is superb.

All things considered the film is a disappointment. Lang brings nothing new to the genre, Fonda's performance is weak, and the totally fictitious script is not compelling.",1292025600,2,5725,4.775530839231547
370756,5,6301802012,"This 1940 color movie has the impediments of its age: the portrayal of blacks, called ""darkies"" in the film, as foolish uneducated boobs and women as beautiful, emotional, home accessories that have difficulty reasoning and should not be taken out for public display. Yet despite these age-old faults, the flick is interesting and at times downright humorous.

 Jesse James is assassinated by the Ford brothers and his brother Frank, who had been hiding as a rancher, helped by a black who can't get it straight that he has to stop calling him Mr. Frank, and a boy who finds that he has his first hair of a beard, is determined to get revenge. Jesse and Frank James, as appropriate for folk heroes, are portrayed as essentially good people; they never killed anyone; they only robbed people. Frank James is a man who is very concerned about other people. Once, in a rush, he asks a man standing by a wagon how much the wagon and its horses cost. The man says he thinks $500 or $600. Honest Frank gives him $600 and two horses. As he drives away, he shouts back, is there anything wrong with the wagon. He probably did not hear the reply, nothing that I know of, but it isn't my wagon. Frank's only fault seems to be that he chews tobacco and spit it out on occasions.

 Frank turns himself in to the sheriff to save a ""darkie"" and is tried for killing a man during a robbery, an act we know, of course, that he could not have committed.",1291852800,2,1436,4.428030303030303
370757,4,6301802012,"Frank James (Henry Fonda) is trying to make a new, peaceful life for himself on his farm in the Ozarks, in the company of young Clem (Jackie Cooper) - sort of an adopted son - and Pinky (Ernest Whitman) a black employee.  His peace is shattered abruptly though when he hears the news that brother Jesse (Tyrone Power, appearing only in a brief scene from the previous year's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jesse-James/dp/B000G6BLDS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jesse James</a>) has been killed by the treacherous Ford brothers, Bob (John Carradine) and Charlie (Charles Tannen).  Soon Frank is off in pursuit, followed by young Clem despite Frank's warnings, heading west to Denver where a pretty young newspaper reporter (Gene Tierney) gets involved in his tale, and eventually ending up in a courtroom fighting for his life, with his old friend Major Rufus Cobb (Henry Hull, absolutely marvellous here) defending him - and Southern honor.

Though this is my second time through THE RETURN OF FRANK JAMES, I strangely enough still haven't seen the first film, directed by Henry King, to which this Fritz Lang film - his first in color and his first western - is a sequel. Several of the cast members from the first film including Fonda, Carradine, Whitman and Hull - return, but director Henry King and screenwriter Nunnally Johnson are replaced, by Lang and Sam Hellman. The director choice was a good one, as Lang's dark determinism works pretty well up to a point in this story of the seemingly doomed Frank obsessively trying to avenge his brother's killing, and though the film doesn't have a whole lot of action, the director knows how to shoot it, with a brief, tense standoff in a narrow rocky canyon being a high point. Lang is a master of nighttime work of course; some critics have called this the first ""noir western"" and I guess they're probably referring mostly to the several dark night shots, which are beautifully done and help to show the director's mastery of shadows even working in the unfamiliar polychrome world for the first time.

The screenplay, though, isn't entirely up to snuff, as hero James and villains the Ford brothers are shown in such ludicrously black-and-white tones that even those who don't care much about historical accuracy are probable going to grimace. There's never really any doubt as to whether Frank will do the right thing, when Pinky gets framed for a murder that most people think Frank committed; and there's never any doubt that Carradine is a dastardly no-good varmint through and through. But the lengthy courtroom sequence is entertaining, if rather silly, the Technicolor photography by George Barnes is brilliant, the acting on the whole is fine, especially that of veteran character actor Henry Hull doing his typical irascible, cantankerous old bird as newspaperman/lawyer Cobb; and Tierney makes her debut, lovely if not exactly top of the class yet.

All in all this is a fairly conventional ""bad guy redeemed and having to fight his way to go straight"" storyline, enlivened as I said by Lang's intense and immediate direction, the excellent use of color and fine cast. It certainly improved on a second viewing, but it remains for me the least impressive and far and away most conventional of Lang's three striking westerns. The year after this he would make&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Western-Union-VHS/dp/630152859X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Western Union [VHS</a>] with Randolph Scott, showing that after just two films he had achieved absolute mastery in this most American of genres.",1285977600,,3644,5.319444444444445
370758,4,6301802012,"In 1940, Darryl Zanuck gave Fritz Lang the opportunity to shoot his first Western - a sequel to director Henry King's ""Jesse James"" (1939). When  asked why he allowed Lang to make a Western, the Fox producer responded: ""Because he'll see things we don't."" Lang's attention to detail and atmosphere dominates this unusual tale of revenge. ""The Return of Frank James"" also marks a cinematic advance for the German director in his vivid use of Technicolor and location photography. An impressive highlight is the chase through the High Sierras - a spectacular action sequence that reveals Lang's expressionist design in his use of architectural rock formations. ""The Return of Frank James"" has a look and feel unlike any Western. In some respects, it can be considered the first ""Western noir."" Henry Fonda delivers a memorable performance in the title role, with good support from Henry Hull, John Carradine and Jackie Cooper.",1201478400,27,924,5.119205298013245
370759,4,6301802012,I have been waiting a long time to have this Henry Fonda Movie on DVD. It is one of those movies you can watch over and over again. Henry Fonda as Frank James is one of the cooles cowboys ever. The supporting cast of characters makes the story that much better.

370762,4,6301802012,"This sequal to Jesse James bring back a number of castmembers from that film. Henry Fonda gets the chance to be the star here. He does a fine job as Frank James, making viewers care for him and understand his need for revenge. Very good color transfer.

370763,4,6301802012,"Fritz Lang's ""The Return of Frank James"" is best-viewed as a warm-up exercise for ""Rancho Notorious."" As a tale of ""hate, murder and revenge"" it falls flat because Henry Fonda is too nice a guy to be a genuine outlaw and the infrequently-glimpsed John Carradine is not nearly a ferocious-enough villain as Bob Ford. (By contrast, Barton MacLaine's evil progress-hating brother in Lang's ""Western Union"" gave good brother Randolph Scott a worthy adversary to overcome.) ""The Return of Frank James"" is beautiful to look at, but it gives the sense of being a mere appendage to Henry King's earlier romantic celebration of the James Brothers, ""Jesse James."" Characters from the King film are retained or dropped randomly. Thus Donald Meek's cowardly sneak of a railroad baron returns, while Randolph Scott's virtuous lawman does not, and Henry Hull's cantankerous newspaper editor becomes a cantankerous country lawyer. I don't dislike ""The Return of Frank James,"" I just wish it were a better film than it is. As it stands, it is definitely the weakest of Lang's three westerns.",1178496000,7,1075,5.113636363636363

7816082,5,6301802012,"""The Return of Frank James,"" is so special to the Jesse James legend  that it must be viewed after you have seen ""Jesse James"" as the title suggests starring Tyrone Power. Nearly the entire star-packed cast from ""Jesse James"" fills this sequel, the likes of Henry Fonda, Henry Hull, John Carradine, Donald Meek and others. More significantly, this features a grown-up Jackie Cooper holding his own and introduces the 20 year old beauty Gene Tierney (""Laura"" 4 years later) in her first feature. The director Fritz Lang continues the vivid on-locale technicolor production standards of Henry King's ""Jesse James."" This too, is thrilling from beginning to end interrupting the violence with a blooming romantic touch (surprising modern feminist overtones) in the magnetic exchanges of Fonda/Tierney that sets up an exciting climax following the prejudiced trial of the local Frank James (Fonda). All the right choices were made by the studio in both films: excellent casting, thrilling story, vividly depicted to underscore why the studio system created such powerful films of lasting endurance. A western film buff's collection is incomplete without this daring 1939 film that matches the indicting power of ""The Grapes of Wrath,"" propelling  Henry Fonda further into film legend.",1491436800,3,1279,5.358208955223881
