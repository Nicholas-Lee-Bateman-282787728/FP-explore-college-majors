8476932,1,B0020MMRWK,"This 12-minute segment on 60 Minutes can be downloaded for free. I was embarrassed when my students asked me why there wasn't more information.  I had stupidly assumed that 60 Minutes would be 60 minutes of information.
Why would anyone but an idiot pay over $17.00 for this downloadable 12-min segment?
To Amazon's Customer Service credit -- when I brought this 'little problem' up and said the DVD is a rip-off, they promptly refunded my money.",1299369600,,446,4.868421052631579
8476933,5,B0020MMRWK,This is a fantastic segment that really will teach anyone who doesn't quite get what dangers are out there on the internet. I have a staff that is made up of many people who casually surf the web but haven't had much formal education on it or what the dangers are. Many people don't understand what links look suspicious and which should look safe. While I don't think that was the goal of this video it was a great way to educate the staff on what viruses can do.,1240272000,,464,4.224719101123595
