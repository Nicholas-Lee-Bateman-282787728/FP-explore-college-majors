The few cartoons are:

1) (George of the Jungle) THE TREASURE OF THE SARAH MADRE - There's gold in them thar trees, and George has the map and two greedy crooks following.

2) (Super Chicken) THE EASTER BUNNY - The Easter Bunny has started robbing banks.

3) (Tom Slick) THE IRISH CHEAPSTAKES - Tom competes with low-down rival Baron Otto Matic for a plastic trophy.

4) (Suoer Chicken) SALVADOR RAG DOLLY - The Birthday Bandit continues to plunder parties.",1147478400,2,575,4.490384615384615
