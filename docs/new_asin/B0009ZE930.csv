8091743,4,B0009ZE930,"This dvd will give you a good workout. There are some interesting kicks and stretches. A nice change if you are use to standard American kickboxing exercise dvds. The moves while not specifically targeting the midsection really works out the abs and waist. I got a moderate-hard workout despite it's flaws which are listed below.

Cons:
1. The dvd cover says that there are 2 programs on the dvd. There is only one.
2. The dvd is in Portuguese but has been dubbed in English and Spanish. The voice over is off a little from the action but it's not too bad.
2. Production is kind of cheesey
4. The music was ok, but the camera guy keep focusing in on the girl in yellow pants.
5. The instructor is a tad bit annoying and is sometimes hard to follow.

I have about 4 Brazilan workout dvds and this one gives me the best workout.",1281916800,,826,4.32258064516129
