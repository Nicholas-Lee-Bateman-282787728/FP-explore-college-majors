8521247,5,B007R5A1C8,"Some have questioned why the Ryan no-hitter was the Blue Jay's broadcast but that is the only television broadcast of that game . In a fluke and extremely rare circumstance, the Rangers only had radio broadcast of that game. I was recording all Ryan games at that time and the only network to show it was out of Canada. Hope this helps clear this question up. Still ,this is probably one of his best ever and one of my most prized possessions!! Most MLB pitchers have been retired10 years by the age he did this .",1522281600,,513,4.354166666666667
8521248,5,B007R5A1C8,"This was a gift for a longtime Texas Ranger fan.  At holiday time, it's sometimes hard to know what to get for the guys in our lives.  The receiver in question has always loved baseball and his special team will always be the Rangers.  But he's not very big on collecting or buying themed items/jerseys for the sake of the brand.  And while I can't bring back the days that he watched Nolan Ryan with his Dad, I could deliver a small package of some of the the Ranger's more important games.

The receiver was thrilled to get this, and has enjoyed watching the discs a little at a time.  How wonderful to find a very special gift for a hard-to-buy-for baseball fan!",1457654400,,665,4.365853658536586
8521249,2,B007R5A1C8,Too heavily leaning to the recent years. Surely they could get there hands on Kenny Rogers perfect game. A perfect game is an Essential game no matter what team you are talking about.,1391990400,4,183,4.575757575757576
8521250,5,B007R5A1C8,This collection is any sports fans dream! The biggest and best moments of the Texas Rangers franchise. The item came quickly and was in great condition like it was described.,1388361600,,174,4.833333333333333
8521251,5,B007R5A1C8,"I'll be the first to admit the Rangers do not have the deepest history in sports.  Take a look and you will see that two of the greatest games in their history here are AL pennant wins (no World Series wins yet) and both within two years.  Still, such as it is, I think the selections here are appropriate.  There are other notable moments, but these were the four biggest.

As a fan, it's nice to have these archived - which also means I can finally erase the 2010 ALCS game 6 off my Tivo after two full years.  The only complaint I have is the source on the Nolan Ryan 7th no hitter.  Granted, that was 20 years ago and thus sources may be scarce, but I was surprised to get the Toronto television feed.  Surely someone at Fox Sports has the tape from when it originally aired - I believe on HSE prior to Fox taking them over.  I also know there are at least portions of the audio feed by the late great Mark Holtz which would have been a nice inclusion as an overdub perhaps.",1346716800,9,978,4.137566137566138
