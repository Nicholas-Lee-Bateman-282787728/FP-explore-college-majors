8171259,5,B000MRA524,"These DVDs are so cute, they are claymation and are timeless. They are pretty boring for adults but I think are perfect for maybe 2-5 year olds. I just like the look of it so much.",1381968000,,180,4.027777777777778
8171260,4,B000MRA524,my kids love these. They are silly and some may not like the humor. But my kids love them 5 & 7 and they are cute and teach life lessons is a fun way. We love that it is the claymation format vs animation. Claymation rocks!,1374451200,,223,3.869565217391304
