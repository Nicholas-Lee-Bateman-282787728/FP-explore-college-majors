8130669,5,B000GDH7PC,"Easter Eggs: push 'Skip' during the intro countdown to get behind the scenes pre show and also push skip during ""A Land Forlorn"" to see the entire ""Intro: At the Fathomless Depths"" song (I won't say why it got cut ;))",1440028800,,217,4.317073170731708
8130670,1,B000GDH7PC,"Very poorly made.  I was looking for a documentary about the history of Mexico in the last 150 to 200 years to understand the major differences between the US and Mexico and why Mexicans want to leave there so much to come to the US.  In one or two sentences in English in this video, I get the gist that Mexico is very corrupt, the legal system leaves a lot to be desired as compared to the better legal / justice system in the US.  This seems cultural.  The problem is that most of this video is in Spanish.  It jumps back and forth from some very brief interviews in English to explanation of historic background all in Spanish.  The intro and credits are extremely amature and this is not geared to an American audience (our national language is English).  I don't think this topic gets enough coverage and the history of Mexico is worth learning about.  I found one 1 hour documentary on PBS that was pretty good.  History channel should invest time and money to cover this topic a lot better than these poorly made videos.  I bought ""From Independence to the Alamo"" as well and it was just as bad.  Approximately 5 to 10 minutes in English in a 50 minute video.",1392508800,,1167,4.381395348837209
8130671,5,B000GDH7PC,"It took a little bit longer than the delivery estimate, but other than that I am so glad to see this. I have looked everywhere for this DVD for the past year and I end up finding it here. The seller has kept their word on this being brand new. I would recommend this DVD and this seller to anyone.",1392163200,,297,3.966666666666667
8130672,5,B000GDH7PC,"This definitely will not dissapoint a fan of Dissection, the sound quality and video is unbelievable, cranked it on my surround sound, it is brutally heavy and thick sound, with great clarity of the more intricate stuff.  As a huge fan, but not so much of Reinkos album, I was thrilled that the entire DVD except for one song, is the best of the best from prior albums.  This is honestly the best DVD of a live show that I own, I can't say enough good things.  RIP Dissection, at least he released this before he went out with a bang.",1283472000,,534,4.267326732673268
8130673,5,B000GDH7PC,"My first entrance into Dissection music and I found it fantastic. Love the black metal sound it his music and lirics. Since then, one of my favorite black metal bands, I do recommend this DVD 100%!!",1227398400,2,198,4.527777777777778
8130674,5,B000GDH7PC,"Dissection is one of my favorite bands of all time. This DVD is perfect and some of Jon's greatest work on this DVD along with an interview. I was highly surprised with the quality of this DVD its so clean and highly produced you would think Warner bros went out and recorded it as if it was a movie.

 This is a must for any dissection fan, unless your one of the too hard core dissection fans who think they sold out with their last album. When that's the exact opposite of what this album is. This album is an invocation to his Dedication to the guitar and music, before he ended his life. HAIL JON!",1199664000,5,602,4.181034482758621
8130675,5,B000GDH7PC,"If you like Dissection YOU MUST own this!
The best DVD i have, can't say more",1188691200,,77,3.875
8130676,5,B000GDH7PC,"Dissection's return to the stage is nothing less than brilliant.  Recorded on Oct. 30, 2004 in front of a sold out crowd in Stockholm Sweden, only a month and a half after Jon's release from prison. Following the intro ""At The Fathomless Depths"" the new line-up performs all the essential classics.  ""Night's Blood"" and ""Frozen"" are played flawlessly followed by ""Maha Kali"" from the new ReinkaOs album.  ""Soulreaper"", ""Where Dead Angels Lie"", ""Retribution - Storm Of The Lights Bane"", ""Unhallowed"", and ""Thorns Of Crimson Death"" are played with perfection, all from the classic album ""Storm Of The Light's Bane"".  ""Heaven's Damnation"", and ""In The Cold Winds Of Nowhere"" are next followed by a cover of ""Elizabeth Bathory"" originally done by Tormentor.  ""The Somberlain"" and ""A Land Forlorn"" finish the show.  The DVD also contains a 25min. interview with Jon and the video of ""Starless Aeon"".  This disc is a must for any fan of the band, and now the only way to see them perform live with Jon being dead.  Hail Dissection, Hail Lucifer!",1168646400,14,1039,4.931034482758621
