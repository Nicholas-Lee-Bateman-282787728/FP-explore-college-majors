4985991,5,B006GGRE9M,I LOVE THE EATING OUT FRANCHISE.. I HOPE THERE IS MORE OF THESE. THESE MOVIES GIVE YOU HOPE ABOUT LOVE,1332547200,,102,4.15
4985992,4,B006GGRE9M,"Eating Out: The Open Weekend is the fifth in the Eating Out series, and while it's an entertaining film in its own right, it is a cut below from previous entries. It isn't as funny as Eating Out 2, 3, and 4, and that probably has something to do with Mink Stole and Rebbekah Kochan being reduced to cameos. Kochan also was only in one scene in Eating Out: Drama Camp. I don't know why this is, since the Eating Out movies are probably the most popular that she has appeared in. And both her and the writers and directors of these movies surely know what a fan base she and her character of Tiffani have. Still, Eating Out: The Open Weekend is pretty fun in fits and starts and worth seeing. But it isn't as consistantly hilarious as past outings.",1332374400,4,746,4.297872340425532
4985993,5,B006GGRE9M,The story was kinda like the 2nd movie.  But I felt more emotionally connected to the characters this time around.  I recommend watching it.,1332374400,2,140,4.791666666666667
4985994,5,B006GGRE9M,"I was counting down to the release of Eating Out: The Open Weekend! Finally, I'm glad to say I have enjoyed each and every one of these films. There are 5 of them! Eating Out: The Open Weekend (the 5th one) is a really good one! Better than the last one I'm sure. I appreciate the comedy and the (lead) actors. Daniel Skelton is such a good looking and sincere (character) actor, he gets better with each one of these films. Although I have mixed feelings about Chris Salvatore I enjoy seeing him and Daniel Skelton get into comical and sexual (for lack of a better word) naughtiness. After watching this one I feel like going back and watching Eating Out: Drama Camp (4) and Eating Out: All You Can Eat (3), both Daniel Skelton and Chris Salvatore star as well. It's worth a watch or 5!",1332201600,3,787,4.360544217687075
4985995,5,B006GGRE9M,"I usualy rate movies on plot, charicterization, setting, ect. Well, forget all that!

This is gay soft core porn that delivers over a dozen hot hunks for your inspection, and keeps the hot factor high enoughf throughout this film that the above mentioned factors realy matter less, although they are there.

This is one of the most fun guilty pleasures I've seen in a long time!

4986063,1,B006GGRE9M,"I did make it through the movie, but wondered why I bothered. It could have been a cute movie but the story line was bloated with unnecessary characters, the acting was high school play, characters became caricatures and the chemistry between characters was bland. I recognize a need for gay story lines, but this film does nothing positive for gay movies. The eye candy was okay.",1399248000,,380,4.7727272727272725

4986080,3,B006GGRE9M,"Given the output of Adam Sandler and Will Ferrell, and the fact that people pay to see their films, it's hard to be too mean to this little series, making light entertainment at a fraction of the cost, and with men worth looking at, no less!

Having said that...

It is most certainly light entertainment;  every now and then a sharply written come back slices through the dialog, and just as often too many of the characters will use a celebrity as metaphor;  then again, while male frontal nudity isn't nearly as rare as it once was, one of the finer characteristics of this series, perhaps even a trademark, is that a character caught naked will walk to the back of the set, stand up (thus providing a full body view) and then pull his pants up.  If you're going to do it, do it, don't just fiddle with tease-angles and quick shots...

Unfortunately, there are also as many wince inducing moments in all of these films as there are in any Ferrell/Sandler work.  The wincing here produced by a story line that is so juvenile that [admittedly very young] gay men sound like teenage girls; all they think about, talk about, is boys.  And catty talk at that.

""Open Weekend"" picks up where the considerably inferior ""Drama Camp"" leaves off (hey, there's inexpensive wine, cheap wine, and then there's Two Buck Chuck).  The winners there get a weekend in Palm Springs, and our two heroes, who were a couple but have now broken up, find themselves in a Palm Springs gay-tel, where Mike's new love tells him they should have ""just one"" open weekend, and trick about.  Speaking from experience, there is no such thing as ""just one"" open weekend, either you work for monogamy or you have your extracurricular adventures and watch your relationship suffer.  But, in the middle of the film, it's announced that Sacramento has created a legal loophole for gay marriage, a one hour ""get hitched"" window and so everyone flocks to a nearby gay-tel to tie the knot, and Mike has to make a decision...  Along the way there's all sorts of gay fun, washboard abs, full frontals, and even a sort of straight menage between a poor virgin girl, and a distinctly not virgin tranny, and a gay-cute ostensible straight bartender at the gay-tel...

Sigh.  Same place, same faces, thirty years on.  Nothing makes one feel so old.  On the other hand, we could be dead, like a lot of guys who would have been our age, so quit whining!

Like I said:  Light entertainment, soft porn sensibilities; occasional full frontal male nudity, idiotic story, lots of wince inducing moments.  There are worse films out there, but they usually don't have such good looking men in them.",1392249600,,2646,4.661637931034483
4986081,2,B006GGRE9M,"I enjoyed the first two installments, but this is just a walking stereotype. It wasn't funny, hot or even enjoyable. The only somewhat humorous moment came at the beginning when Casey and his friend were checking into the motel, and the desk clerk is the actress who played Jan Brady (from the first two Brady Bunch Movies)..Funny, she was the only decent actor in this glossed over poor excuse for gay themed entertainment.  All the guys are one dimensional, and what attractive qualities they do have are watered down by their lack of personality and outright stupidity. The end result is disappointment.",1391817600,,606,4.9411764705882355
4986082,4,B006GGRE9M,The best thing about this series is that the light fare is not boggled down by an overlong movie length.  It does not attempt to be message themed or preachy in its entertainment goals.,1391817600,,185,4.4411764705882355
4986083,1,B006GGRE9M,This movie is an insult to one's intelligence.  The attempt at comedy is moronic.  THis more humor and a better story line in most Mickey Mouse cartoons.,1391731200,2,153,4.62962962962963
4986084,5,B006GGRE9M,"I have loved the Eating Out movies since the first one. Yes it is more gay friendly than most of them but, that is more than ok since the movies have been going that way since Eating Out All You Can Eat. If your favorite is All You Can Eat you will not be upset. I would say watch them in order so you don't get lost. 1. Eating Out 2. Eating Out Sloppy 2nds 3. Eating Out all you can eat. 4. Eating Out Drama Camp 5. Eating Out The Open Weekend. Hope you enjoy.",1390521600,,461,3.8125
4986085,2,B006GGRE9M,"Now a part of me is still annoyed that this movie franchise has transitioned from starting with a clever premise (the whole straight guy pretending to be queer, etc) to have degenerated into just lying. And we seem to be stuck with the cast of the third movie in all subsequent sequels, which probably isn't all that bad but some of the plot twists are starting to lose coherence. And while I appreciate the relative sense of continuity offered by having the same core actors in the subsequent sequels, it still doesn't guarantee good storytelling.

And maybe this has to do with the fact I'm personally against open relationships since it leads to too much trouble. But that's a personal opinion outside of my review of this movie. At least that's what I keep reminding myself.

Now the movie follows two main tracks. On the one hand we have the ex-lovers trying to pretend everything is okay with their respective partners (of sorts). And this involves the usual instances of one spotting the the other guy's partner is seemingly cheating with other guys when in fact it's part of the open relationship or the fact that he's not actually in a relationship - you should know which one is which. On the other hand, we have the two girls running after the one straight guy in the resort, this being the waiter Luis (Alvaro Orlando). And naturally Luis is heavily flirting with both ladies.

Credit where credit is due, most of the guys are definitely hot in this movie. I know I already said this as part of my introduction for this review, but I'll say it again. I can definitely see how the likes of Aaron Milo and Michael Vera are bound to meet the physical standards of most gay guys with slightly hairier Chris Salvatore and highly twinky Daniel Skelton fleshing out the outliers of the taste range. To each his own, I suppose. But I fear that they don't contribute all that much to the overall narrative beyond that function of eye candy.

And the overall story is just, well, blah, for lack of a better term. I don't see what meaningful fulfillment the characters end up with by the time of the resolution of the movie's various plot threads. And quite frankly, I feel that we end up simply changing the sequence of partners around and see who comes out of this particular merry-go-round. I suppose it can't be helped, I suppose. Brocka is determined to focus on a single aspect of the queer community - one that celebrates infidelity and apparently very smooth bodies. And as a creator of movies, that's always going to be his prerogative.",1390176000,,2546,4.626106194690266

Benji (Aaron Milo) goes into a bathroom to use a urinal. Then another man, Piel (Chris Puckett), walks in to use the urinal to the right. Piel looks at Benji down there and then eventually Benji looks at him down there. Piel then touches Benji's arm to move his hand down to his. Then Zach (Chris Salvatore) walks in to use the urinal to the left. Benji and Piel stop and continue urinating. Then Piel and Benji touch each other again. Zack asks Benji what he is doing. Benji replies, ""Having fun"". and to ""Join in"". Benji kisses Zack. Piel takes his shirt off and then kisses Benji and takes his shirt off. A blond man walks in and joins them. Three more men walk in and join them, then two more and three more men walk in and all men are kissing each other.
  Benji snaps his fingers at Zack and the daydream is over. Benji and Zack are still at the urinal.

4986092,3,B006GGRE9M,"It doesn't come close to the earlier ones.  I think the joke has worn out.  The first couple of movies were funny, but after that, it's down hill.",1383350400,,146,4.178571428571429
4986093,5,B006GGRE9M,"I really like all the ""eating out"" movies. They are all kind of representative of the modern young gay culture.",1383004800,,111,4.6
4986094,4,B006GGRE9M,it was a good movie but i like the first 3 better but i will recommend it to my friends,1381968000,,87,3.4

4986096,1,B006GGRE9M,"Starts nowhere and goes nowhere. Humorless, plotless, snarky, no real attempt to follow a story line. I suppose the producers thought they could rely on eye candy - sorry, not even that. It looks like they wandered into Wal-Mart at midnight and picked the first ten guys they saw stacking shelves.",1379548800,5,297,4.8431372549019605

4986100,5,B006GGRE9M,"Eating Out: The Open Weekend is the latest in a series of Eating Out movies.  The movie brings us to the next level of the relationship between Casey (Daniel Skelton) and Zack (Chris Salvatore).  Zack is torn between his desire for a monogamous relationship and his current partner Benjis desire for an open relationship. Zack had broken up with Casey in the previous movie, Eating Out: Drama Camp, to be with Benji.  Having won a weekend in Palm Springs, the boys arrive with the plan for their open weekend. Casey shows up and convinces a high school friend to pretend to be Caseys boyfriend. What he really wants is Zack back. This series of movies are campy and fun. The first two out of a series of five, had different main characters, but the transition was smooth.  The movie makes you laugh and brightens your whole day. I wait with anticipation for the next installment.",1378512000,,879,4.651612903225806

4986102,5,B006GGRE9M,"If you are looking for a movie that will blow your mind, this is not it.
instead it is a cheesy light hearted film to take your mind off more serious life matters.
I love because it is an easy watch.",1373414400,,199,3.8780487804878048
4986103,1,B006GGRE9M,"Very strange and stupid story and while think this is the 4th in this series it was in the bottom of the ranking.  Besides some great bodies to look at, the rest of it was a total bore.",1373068800,,185,3.8684210526315788
4986104,4,B006GGRE9M,It was great to see the characters back together and get introduced to some new ones. There were some hints about a new movie coming out and I can't wait to see it!,1371686400,,164,4.0

4986109,5,B006GGRE9M,This is a great comedy.  It made me laugh and cry all at the same time.  How would you not be impressed with the young men in this love camp!!!,1365552000,,143,3.7333333333333334
4986110,4,B006GGRE9M,"Okay it is an Eating Out Sequel...if you have seen the other movies, you pretty much know what to expect.  However I will say I think this is my favorite by far.  The acting, story, filming, etc was all good and loved the happy ending.  The other movies in the series had more eye candy but this one told a good story, well in relation to the series as a whole.",1365292800,,361,4.056338028169014
