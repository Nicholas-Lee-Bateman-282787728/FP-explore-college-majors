Tony Williams exploded on to the modern jazz seen as a teenager drumming behind the likes of Miles Davis and Jackie McLean and displaying truly incredible chops and personality at such a young age. Over the course of the seventies he left behind some of his earlier approach, became a band leader and composer, and developed into one of the masters and singular voices on the instrument. In 1985 he presented a new concept with a new band and the album, Foreign Intrigue. Trumpeter Wallace Roney and pianist Mulgrew Miller became core members of this new band. The group rounded out with Bill Pierce on saxophones and Charnett Moffett on bass (the latter eventually replaced by Ira Coleman) on their next record, Civilization. The group is in full swing by their third record, Angel Street, recorded in 1988. All of the albums are good -- the music changes such that it holds one's interest, while the band centers on a collective personality around Tony Williams' creation. Williams plays drum solos between some of the tunes that are hard hitting and amazingly melodic. The band might sound sort of dated if you're hearing it for the first time over 25 years later now. However, no matter when you hear it, this is some of the most masterful drum set playing from one of the most singular artists -- one of the very best drummers of all time. Wallace Roney really throws down on this set too, and he and TW really get into it. You also can't miss what a unique and beautiful artist Mulgrew Miller was (gone too soon). While comparatively understated to this listener, saxophonist Bill Pearce and bassist Ira Coleman are also great and integral to the collective personality. A truly great performance and one of the best representations of this great band.
