2047293,2,B0001ZJQA4,"I was disappointed when I watched these dvds.  I purchased both of Neon's volume 1 and volume 2, and I am returning both. I am sure I could learn something from them, but the flavor and the spirit is not what I was looking for at all.  I find her approach interesting, but I am going elsewhere.

I was expecting more of a traditional type of instruction. Neon seems very talented, and is quite easy to understand, but this was not what I wanted.  I am sure she is an accomplished dancer,  but I wanted authentic music, and more traditional instruction for someone interested in belly dancing for belly dancing, not for clubbing,  not just a surface approach.

I have to say that the spacy techno music is HORRIBLE!!.  How she chose that as accompaniment is beyond me.  I love middle eastern music, and that was a real let down.

I have to move on to something more to my taste.  Sorry Neon.",1148256000,7,890,4.398773006134969
2047294,5,B0001ZJQA4,"Beginners: Take a chance on this tape if you have had problems learning from other tapes. You can't go wrong for the price. You probably won't like this DVD if you want expensive production. Get the much hyped ""Goddess workout"" if you want to fantasize you are a gorgeous bellydancer...  It would be a better gift for someone. It is production perfect: You will see a perfect looking blonde in a gorgous background. But, if you really want to learn and you are movement challenged like I am -- get this DVD. Nothing fancy, just pure learning.

I always read and trust the reviews of DVD's from Shira's bellydance website. Neon was never mentioned there so I didn't pay too much attention to her when I would see her DVD's for sale now and then on ebay. Then one day out of curiousity looked at her reviews from Amazon. I was very impressed at what people said. I took a chance and bought it since one was for sale cheap (used). I have a number of bellydance DVDs for beginners, but this is the first one that I can really learn from explanation as well as visually. Many people taking bellydance have dance backgrounds and are visual learners. For them it isn't too important who the teacher is as long as they have good form. They see, then do.  They can look at someone and copy easily because they understand where their bodies are in space. They do well in classes.... I don't.  I need to go really slow and have explanation accompanying the visual.  This doesn't come easily in most classes or videos, but this video delivers.

Because Neon wears a LOT of makeup, I think people judge her as a ""bimbo"" who maybe couldn't deliver a good lesson. Trust me: Don't judge the book by the cover... this gal is SHARP. I am a teacher (not for dance) so I know a good teacher when I encounter one. This lady proves that she has an UNCANNY ability to teach.. better than American born teachers who might have a more serious appearance. If I hadn't seen the rave reviews I might have stereotyped her as well.  Neon will blow you away with her breakdown of movements.. I promise. I learned a lot less from expensive tapes. I have also taken classes from excellent bellydancers at 100/hr private lessons who couldn't tell me HOW they do their moves... they could only show me. I think it takes a certain inborn teaching quality to break movements down to their simplest components. I agree with the other reviewer who said she liked the way she ""relates moves to each other."" You will see what I mean if you get the video. She will teach a move and show you  how to tweak it and make it another similar move. I think even bellydance teachers should see this video because they could improve teaching skills.",1138060800,18,2698,4.469512195121951
2047295,5,B0001ZJQA4,"I've had Neon's ""Instant Belly Dancer: A Crash Course in Belly dance Hipwork Plus"" since summer and it still stays on top of the stack.  I don't even bother to put it away.  THAT's how much I use this DVD.  Neon teaches hip work and also ""walks"" like no other video instructor.  She treats belly dance as a system so you can understand connections between various types of walks and hip moves and the ways they can be combined.  I started learning bellydance kind of randomly because I changed teachers.  I ended up learning the same moves over again but with different names.  Neon's DVDs have given a clear structure to my understanding of bellydance moves.  Sometimes the only difference between two moves is the direction of an accent or the way you count and lay that movement on the rhythm.  It's more than just remembering the different moves.  Neon's DVDs (I have both ""Instant Belly Dancer"" DVDs) show the building blocks of each movement so you learn how even the simplest movement is a combination of even simpler ones.  Once you get this you can see the mechanics of any movement, even the most complicated ones.  So even though I already knew more than half of the material taught in this DVD, Neon's system makes it tons easier for me to handle new choreographies.  By the way I am not a reviewer, I only wrote this because I read some other ""reviews"" here that struck me as personal attacks on Neon and that really say nothing about this DVD.  If you are not ready for this material because you need more basic training, lay this DVD on the shelf and let it wait there for you to catch up to it.  Don't proclaim your ignorance by bashing the most talented instructor who has done more than anyone out there to make belly dancing easy to learn.",1132012800,10,1758,4.5015772870662465
2047296,2,B0001ZJQA4,"i purchased this dvd along with the volume 1 dvd, and it was a waste of my time and money.  not only were most of the moves hard to follow, they were too oriented to the club scene and not bellydance, not to mention neon is a very scary looking lady!  the movement diagramming that sounds so helpful in other reviews was actually kind of confusing.  if you are first starting out and have never seen belly dancing before, this dvd set might be acceptable, but a better use of your money is to enroll in some lessons in your hometown if you can (they have helped me tremendously!) or to try ANYTHING by Veena and Neena--they are much easier on the eye than neon is AND they teach you basic moves and even basic choreography.",1129161600,4,723,4.301470588235294
2047297,2,B0001ZJQA4,The DVD covers all the moves needed for belly dancing....but it's soooo fast paced you really don't get a chance to practice what you've just learned.,1105920000,10,150,4.8076923076923075
2047298,4,B0001ZJQA4,not enough repetition but good graphics and instruction wish theyd play something else besides the techno.,1104537600,7,106,5.6875
2047299,5,B0001ZJQA4,"This is the second video in the top notch Instant Bellydance series. As a compliment to her `Curves"" video, the instructor, Neon, has chosen a set of bellydance movements that all have a foundation in angular movement. The order in which she teaches them builds one movement upon the last. It is much easier to learn the movements when they all have the same foundation instead of bouncing around from one type of movement to the next. This helps to cut down the learning curve and make your proficiency more `instant,' as well as allowing Neon to pack many, many more dance moves into her video. You will find a huge amount of instruction and value for your money! If you don't already own the Instant belly Dancer Curves"" video, I recommend you pick it up first. It's not required to view ""Curves"" before `Hipwork Plus"", this video stands on its own, but the novice bellydancer will find it especially helpful to start there. The segments in the ""Extras"" section will be particularly helpful.

 In this video you will learn:
 -Horizontal Slides: hip slides, hip pushes side/diagonal, hip pushes back, head slides, chest slides, shoulder pushes, shoulder shimmies, hip twists, hip swivel shimmies, and combinations
 -Vertical Slides: up-down hip slides, up-down hip shimmies, up-down hip slides with a twist, downward arc hip slides, upward arc hip slides, and combinations
 -Lifts and Drops: side hip lifts/drops, 1 hip twists, front hip lifts/drops, back hip lifts/drops, chest lifts/drops, pelvic locks, stomough pulses, and combinations
 -Parallel Arcs: front-back upward arcs, front-side upward arcs, side-back upward arcs, front-side-back upward arcs, front-back downward arcs, front-side downward arcs, side-back downward arcs, front-side-back downward arcs, and combinations
 -Perpendicular Arcs: side upward arcs, front upward arcs, back upward arcs, side downward arcs, front downward arcs, back downward arcs, and combinations.

 At the end of each teaching section the moves are layered and combined to create beautiful bellydance movement.

 The production value is great! Neon is set against a black background which makes it very easy to see her movements. Neon's instruction is very clear. Although English is not Neon's first language, she's of Russian origin, she is extraordinarily articulate and elegant in her speech. She's one of the few instructors who does not require a voice over. One should have no problem understanding her clear and concise instruction.

 One of the hallmarks of the two videos in her series (this one and the ""Instant Belly Dancer: Curves"" video) are the geometric overlays used to help explain the movements. The computerized geometric overlays are placed directly on Neon's body during instruction to help the viewer better see the angle and direction of each movement. These same overlays are also used on a figure in the background as a constant reference point. It cannot be stressed how helpful these overlays are in bellydance instruction. These overlays are very useful to explain the difference between movements that may look similar to the beginner but are actually done with different muscles in the body and are foundations for more intricate moves later. What a fantastic idea! Bravo Neon!

 Most of the instruction either shows Neon's whole body, or body from the hips up so you can easily see how everything integrates. Close-ups are used to show specific areas of isolation but then return quickly to full length shots to complete the picture. Sometimes the close-ups are inset the full length shot so you can see more than one view simultaneously. One of the biggest faults of many bellydance videos is that they show close-ups when the viewer would need a full length shot and vice versa leaving the viewer very frustrated. This video seems to have the balance down correctly which is a very pleasant surprise.

 Neon is dressed in a bellydance top, `nightclub' pants, and heels. Her outfit makes it very easy to see the movement of her body while she is teaching. The outfit is a little closer to what you might wear yourself in a nightclub rather than if you were a performer. It is important to note that the style of bellydance she teaches here is what one could easily do while dancing in a nightclub. It's an easy, sensual, and feminine way to spice up your dancing when going out. Her ""Curves"" video used both traditional drum solo music as well as techno/dance style music to teach the moves. This video almost entirely uses the techno/dance music.

 One note, I almost didn't get this video when I saw the cover, which would have been a shame because it turned out to be so fantastic! Neon wears a lot of makeup and is in the category my husband would call ""too much!"" She would rival some of the locally famous drag queens in my home town! Although all performers wear lots of makeup while performing, don't let the unnecessarily giant quantity this beautiful woman wears be a detraction for you. It is apparently very normal for some Russian women to wear this much makeup, I'm told, and if this is the only thing `wrong' with this video, as far as I can tell, then you have a fantastic set on your hands!",1091664000,,5183,4.9780092592592595
2047300,5,B0001ZJQA4,"This is my third bellydance DVD and it is by far the best one.  It covers A LOT of bellydance hip movements and combinations, from basic to intricate.  True to the title, it presents everything in a clear, intuitive way that I understand ""INSTANTLY.""  As I was watching this DVD for the first time I was able to grasp quite a few bellydance concepts that I was really not getting after trying for months in weekly group classes.  Neon is a terrific instructor, showing everything in an extremely well-organized and systematic way.  For example, she arranges all the movements in categories that show how they are connected and what comes from what.  With the categories I can remember things and combine them on my own.  Every single move is illustrated in excellent computer graphics drawn on Neon's moving body.  It's a whole integrated system.  So after months of feeling frustrated in class and actually having a lot of doubt about whether I could do this, I'm now moving forward very rapidly.  I know this is only because of what I have picked up from this DVD.",1088899200,27,1066,4.682795698924731

8018962,5,B0001ZJQA4,This is my favorite belly dance teacher.  Her voice is soothing while she is teaching moves that she explains in simplicity with detail.  She is so fun to watch also.,1406592000,,166,4.5
8018963,4,B0001ZJQA4,"This is more like a fast and furious taste of belly dance than a course. There aren't really enough repetitions for most beginners to really get the hang of it. Plus, I think it could be a little intimidating for a beginner because of the fast pace. I highly recommend Neon's You Can Bellydance! if you are an actual beginner. You Can Bellydance! not only teaches you some great moves, but it takes you through them at a comfortable pace and then puts them together in two fun dance routines. So if you want a quick glimpse at belly dance, go ahead and purchase Instant BellyDancer (I recommend shopping around for the best price). But if you really want to feel empowered to belly dance when you've had very little experience, get You Can Bellydance! first.",1334534400,,758,4.580882352941177
8018964,5,B0001ZJQA4,I have the first Volume and I found them easy to view and practice with.  It has helped me greatly with my dance moves and provides a great workout for me.  I give it two thumbs up!,1220313600,,181,3.864864864864865
8018965,5,B0001ZJQA4,"i also bought the bellydance dvd by Kathy Smith, but by far i loved this one by Neon (i really thought this was going to be more of a silly 'gimick', basing on her unusual name 'Neon', but it turns out she really knows her stuff!)

she takes you thru many basic moves, w/an overlying grid to show you precisely how to do it, and is taught an easy but not TOO slow of a pace either lol. i have both her 1 and 2 dvd, and i'm now ordering her ""Dance Today! Bellydance - Active Lifestyle Makeover"" dvd (for fun and to test out my newest skills).

this one's a real bargin for the price! :)",1206662400,,585,3.9914529914529915
8018966,5,B0001ZJQA4,"This workout is the first video bellydance workout I have purchased.  I recently began weekly lessons and I find the video has helped me with extra practice.  In the video, Neon's moves are easy to see, she has a great body which is motivating as well.  Her routines progress in order of difficulty so by the time she gets to explaining ''arcs'' your abs will definately be warmed up.  She refers to her first video workout a few times, as she puts a few moves in that are not covered in this one, but I did not find it a problem. There are a few steps I found more difficult, but it was not discouraging as everytime I do the video, it is easier. I intend to buy her first one very soon.  For me, this video has helped me mainly breaking down the moves into precise steps, which is different from my formal class.  Since I have not done any other bellydance videos, I have nothing to compare it to, but I feel my dancing has become more fluid and relaxed since I began this video.  I recommend it.",1173312000,4,998,4.221052631578948
8018967,4,B0001ZJQA4,"However, I believe the price is kind of high and I found it at [...] You can imagine how mad I got after seeing that:( Also, if you want to be successful at bellydancing...a DVD is not enough, no matter how good it is...This DVD is useful, but you need to take a class to improve...Also, the DVD is far more useful if you really make time for it...which means...practice every day or at least 2/week...That has been my problem...it's hard to find time for everything...",1172275200,3,469,4.465116279069767
8018968,1,B0001ZJQA4,This DVD was quite disapointing.  The structure was choppy.  The overall look was cheesey and rough.  And quite frankly I just can't warm up to Neon.  I have a another video where she is part of an ensemble and she's the low point even among lesser known instructors.,1161993600,,267,4.5
8018969,5,B0001ZJQA4,"Neon is an exciting dancer with an amazingly precise and clear teaching technique.  She is one of my absolute all time favorites. Unfortunately she doesn't do tours or workshops, so I am happy that I can see her work on DVD.  I find Instant Bellydancer 1 very useful, and I've just purchased Instant Bellydancer 2.  Both DVDs are dictionaries of belly dance movement.  There is a lot of material  that builds on the basics such as combinations, transitions and drills.  With Neon everything is system based, you get a very clear explanation of the technique for each and every step plus you get to understand how different movements are related and therefore how they can be combined.

Instant Bellyedancer 2 is devoted mostly to hip isolations and combinations and it is superb! Neon is an expert teacher, actually she does the best job of teaching beginners I've ever seen. She explains things in such a simple yet articulate way that even if you are only half-listening you will get it right.  She won't let you get away with mushy travel steps or unfinished figure 8s!  You think a ""crash course"" is a gimmick until you actually experience her teaching style.

Here is what you will find on Insatnt Bellydancer 2:

HORIZONTAL SLIDES each of the sections below consists of basic technique,  combinations, and a practice session. For every hips isolation you get a few different travel steps using that isolation, some of them rather challenging.

  Hip push, slide,

  Chest slide

  Shoulder accents and shimmies

  Hips twists and swivel shimmy

  Review (a practice session that includes all the above moves and combinations, some new and some from the practice sessions above)

VERTICAL SLIDES same here, every section below has basic technique,  combinations, and a practice session

  Vertical hip slides

  Up-down hip shimmy

  Vertical hip slides with a twist (including arabic hip walk)

  Upward and downward arc hip slides

  Review (a practice session that includes all the moves and combinations above, some new and some from the practice sessions)

LIFTS AND DROPS  same structure in each section (basic technique,  combinations, and a practice session)

  Hip lift and drop

  1-Hip twist

  Chest lift and drop

  Pelvic drops and locks

  Review (practice session that includes all the moves and combinations above, some new and some from the practice sessions)

ARCS same structure,

  Front-back upward arc (hips) and front-side-back upward arc

  Front-back downward arc and front-side-back downward arc

  Review (a practice session that includes all the moves and combinations above, some new and some from the practice sessions)

There are also two other menu items:

  Practice 1 plays all the practice sessions for each move together.  It's an amazing 50 minutes of drills and combinations!

  Practice 2 is all the Review sections combined into one class.  It's more challanging than Practice 1 because there are no isolations drills, it's only combinations so it moves much faster,  but it's only aboyt 10 minutes",1154649600,30,3044,5.084188911704312
8018970,4,B0001ZJQA4,"The Crash Course in Bellydance, the first dvd, was great!  The learning pace is a bit fast, but the workout left me feeling quite toned. The Hipwork Plus was a shorter less intense workout.  I probably won't be using it too often.  It was not worth buying by the standards of the first dvd.",1154304000,,290,4.333333333333333
