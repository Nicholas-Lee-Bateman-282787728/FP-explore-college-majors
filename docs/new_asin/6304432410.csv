876449,4,6304432410,"Sadly, this sequal to the classic 'Curse of Peladon' is a light-hearted 'fun' story, rather than something which repeats the intelligent, stylish  and well-written 'Curse'.  True, it's certainly worthwhile entertainment,  but the whole thing is undermined by weak human characters - the miners  with their idiotic badger hairstyles, the pathetic queen (how could she  ever have clung to power for any time at all?) and the 'baddie' who just  stands around like a spare part for most of the episodes.  There's also a  fight scene in which a stuntman doubling as the Doctor is wearing a wig  which looks nothing like Jon Pertwee's hair.  You can even see the  stuntman's face at one point.  However, the story is saved by the Ice  Warriors, who have returned to their evil ways and dominate their every  scene.  Especially good is the Ice Lord Azaxyr (spelling?) who has real  menacing on-screen presence.
Don't get me wrong.  This is not a bad  adventure - in fact I enjoyed most of it.  It's just not the sequel it  might have been.",966643200,2,1032,4.755681818181818
876450,2,6304432410,"It's not the best of Jon Pertwee and it's certainly not the best Doctor  Who in the world but it's fun to watch.  I have watched it many times even  though the acting is not so good for the most part, except for Jon  Pertwee(Dr. Who) and Liz Sladen(his compainion, Sara).  Alpha Centuri was  just plain annoying but very intresting to look at. Despite what Doctor Who  reviews have said knocking Queen Thalira as being weak and defensless,  odviously they have not payed closer attention.  First off, that is part of  the story being a Peladonian and all, second, she eventually takes a stand  as Queen of Peladon when the Doctor and Sara are in trouble and thereafter.  The Ice Warrior Commander is probably what made the show though, the actor  who played him did a very good job, but his fellow Ice Warriors were less  than impressive with zero personality or agility, they were as clumsy as a  cow and probably about as stupid. I wouldn't say it's the best of the best  but I don't dislike it either.",965433600,5,1004,4.4944444444444445
876451,2,6304432410,"Yep... Alpha Centauri looks like he just came off a Muppets set. But sillier! The first of these two vids is definately (yawn) mediocre. The second tape's not bad though. Certainly a lot more action and, seemingly,  better acting.
One thing becomes quite obvious... the BBC is preparing  its audience for the (death) regeneration of Jon Pertwee into Tom Baker, in  the next story- Planet Of The Spiders. Jon and Liz do a more mature bit of  acting here; perhaps there's genuine sorrow that the Pertwee era is soon to  come to an end.
Yep! Tape #2 is the one to watch! Heehee.",937094400,2,575,4.543689320388349

876503,5,6304432410,"My mistake, this is the second story of Peledon where the Dr. takes Sarah Jane to Peladon and finds trouble brewing between the late King's daughter and the Federation, over a vital mineral needed.  This story is just as good as the first with Jo Grand and stands on it's own.

Please disregard my review for the Curse of Peladon, which is the first story. I mistakenly read the title wrong when writing the review.  The first story involves the Dr. and Jo being mistaken for representatives from Earth; and the Dr. is on the committee assessing  Peladon's petition into the Federation, but trouble soon brew's when the King's advisor is killed.

The Doctor returns a generation later, to find that the planet has joined the Galactic Federation as expected, but all is not going well. There is unrest between the people and their aristocracy due to the demands the Federation is making for certain rare minerals needed for the ongoing war with Galaxy Three. There are aliens aplenty in this episode! We have the Peladonians, who are mostly human-looking except for the lower classes who have a most interesting badger-like hair color. Then there are Ice Warriors, who along with a single Centuri ambassador represent the Federation. There is palace intrigue and betrayals of trust, and the Doctor must defuse a civil war while uncovering the underlying plot. This second Peladon adventure features Sara Jane Smith as the companion rather than Jo Grant who was in the initial Peladon story.

MONSTER OF PELADON
Story # 73
Season 11's Fourth Story
Third Doctor, Jon Perwee Era, Penultimate story of the final season 1973-74
Fourth Classic Sarah Jane Smith Story

OVERALL STORY RATING 7/10
Another Pertwee-era story that has been very unfairly reviewed as ""Poor"" over the years.  The poor reviews are due to comparison to CURSE OF PELADON, which is a major mistake.  Such comparison will have the viewer continually referencing CURSE OF PELADON while watching MONSTER OF PELADON, instead of watching MONSTER OF PELADON on its own merits. While both stories share the same location, each story is its own adventure, in its own time, and it is necessary to view each story that way in order to appreciate the unique circumstances, and charms of each story. Indeed, some of the negative reviews of this story over the years honestly make one wonder if the reviewer actually saw MONSTER OF PELADON while watching it, as the reviewer seemed to describe a story far different than the one unfolding onscreen.  For example, many reviewers have stated how sad it is that ""Sarah Jane"" has deteriorated into the ""standard screaming female companion"", a statement that is 100% inaccurate, as detailed below in ""ACTING"".  Such an inaccurate statement by a reviewer appears to betray the fact that they either ""fast-forwarded"" through MONSTER OF PELADON, or were so busy mentally comparing it to CURSE OF PELADON that they did not actually see MONSTER OF PELADON!

If the viewer will actually watch MONSTER OF PELADON, they will be rewarded with a fine character-based Science Fiction adventure that drags very little for a Six-Part Classic Doctor Who story. It is a story that continues the path of Sarah Jane Smith as a strong companion who enhances and expands WHO story lines, and a story that allows the unique Third Doctor era to approach its end with the strength and class it deserves.

Essential viewing for SARAH JANE ADVENTURES fans, and a highly recommended story for veteran Whovians. MONSTER OF PELADON is probably not a good story to introduce a novice to WHO, though.

STORY & SCRIPT 9/10
Excellent Brian Hayles script, that continues the Barry Letts / Terrance Dicks production team push that began in Season 9, of moving the program away from earth-based, UNIT-centered stories into more complex, adult science fiction story lines.

ACTING 10/10
Excellent performances by both regular and guest casts.  In their fourth adventure together, Jon Pertwee and Elisabeth Sladen have grown into a Doctor/Companion relationship of mutual respect, with warm playfulness and affectionate teasing that charms the viewer. Jon Pertwee's Third Doctor has aged noticeably since his Season 7 debut, but remains as active and dashing as ever.  Elisabeth Sladen's ""Sarah Jane"" continues the strong, independent, capable, intelligent, and resourceful companion that debuted in TIME WARRIOR. In MOP Part 2, Sarah, who has now obviously grown very close to the Doctor, instantly goes to his aid when she senses he may be in danger, and she accidentally discovers and is able to bring a major clue to the Doctor's attention. In MOP Part 3, the Doctor and Sarah advise the Queen together, and it is a genuine case of equal co-advise from each.  When the Doctor is imprisoned, Sarah takes charge of his plans, moves them forward on her own, improvising as needed and also while arranging to break the Doctor out of prison. She also plays diplomat, and effectively advises and wins over the Queen's advisor Ortron, in the Doctor's absense. This is the ""Sarah"" that is the ""typical screaming female companion"" as seen by the reviewers who apparently did not actually see MONSTER OF PELADON while watching it for review!

The major guest cast members are not only excellent in their respective roles, but ALL are actually standouts: Nina Thomas is very convincing as the young, inexperienced, uncertain Queen Thalira; Donald Gee absolutely shines in subtly revealing ""Eckersley""; Ralph Watson's ""Ettis"" is fascinating to watch as he gradually goes mad; Frank Gatliff's Ortron almost takes the stage from everyone at times, and is oddly likable even if irritatingly narrow-minded much of the time. Even the smaller roles are well-done, and convincing. Very good casting of excellent stage-trained actors in MONSTER OF PELADON.

PRODUCTION QUALITY 8/10
Lennie Mayne's direction is practically flawless. The story is a fairly well-paced Pertwee 6-Parter! The story's political wrangling is a bit complex and confusing and does threaten to get a bit tedious, but thankfully a major plot shift occurs before that happens. There is a lot of tunnel running, BUT this is a mining planet, so tunnel travel has to be part of the story!  Over all, the story is roughly 90% perfect production-wise, with probably 10% that could have been streamlined.

SPECIAL EFFECTS 8/10
Very well-done realistic special effects, and stunt coordination most of the time.  Terry Walsh doubling for Jon Pertwee in a fight scene does pop up as noticeable in Parts 4 & 5, as the only real bobble.

STORY IMPORTANCE 7/10
MONSTER OF PELADON is:
(A) the penultimate story of Jon Pertwee's Third Doctor; Pertwee's ""Doctor"" and the Letts/Dicks production team had moved DOCTOR WHO from the point of cancellation at the end of Season 6, onto the path of ratings success, that continued for all 5 Pertwee years, laying the foundation for the first 3 highly successful Tom Baker years. The Pertwee era were incredibly important years to DOCTOR WHO; the program would likely not have survived without them.

(B)a story far more complex, dangerous and adult than CURSE OF PELADON, making ""MONSTER..."" much more than a simple ""Sequel"" to ""CURSE..."";

(C) The 4th Classic Sarah Jane Smith story, continuing the unique, strong character on the track that would make Elisabeth Sladen's ""Sarah Jane"" the one solid WHO foundation capable of merging the Classic and New Series in the minds of all fans, both old and new.

These reasons and more, move MONSTER OF PELADON well above an average story in the ""WHONIVERSE"".

DVD EXTRAS 8/10
Very good across the board.  The documentary THE PELADON SAGA-PART TWO is very good, and ON TARGET-TERRANCE DICKS is superb.  On screen text commentary by Martin Wiggins is excellent, informative, and well worth the viewer's attention. The commentary is very good, and Part 4 commentary is an interesting departure from normal in being a commentary by four selected fans.

These wonderful DVD extras are what make Classic WHO DVD's such special treats, so DO NOT overlook them as you will be losing a tremendous portion of the enormous value of a Classic WHO DVD!

876510,4,6304432410,"I am a very big Doctor Who fan.  And I remember watching this Doctor Who story, way back in the day.  However, it was so long ago that I didn't remember much of it.  I was interested in watching the sequel to the previous Doctor Who Peladon story.  I'd read in other places where people didn't consider this to be a very good story, so my expectations were low.  I was pleasantly surprised, however.  No, it isn't the best story, and not the best Jon Pertwee Doctor Who story, either, but give it a try, I think you'll find it better than you expected.",1304467200,,552,4.259615384615385
876511,3,6304432410,"The Peladon stories (first ""The Curse of Peladon,"" followed by ""The Monster of Peladon"" two seasons later) are fondly remembered by many Who fans for their menagerie of imaginative alien creatures and lively, action-driven plotting, but it's an enthusiasm I have difficulty sharing. I've always found the stories' setting dark and claustrophobic, and the action feels cramped. The Peladon stories could almost have been performed on radio without losing much in the translation.

""Curse"" is notable for reintroducing the Ice Warriors as a reformed, peace-loving race that now eschews war for a leading role in a growing Galactic Federation (they return to characteristic, evil form in ""Monster""), but the other aliens in these stories are hard to take. First, the hermaphroditic hexapod from Alpha Centauri (who appears in both ""Curse"" and ""Monster"") is screechy and annoying, a one-eyed green monstrosity that must wear living-room curtains around its neck to cover up the unnatural juncture of its head with its stalklike body. The design of Arcturus in ""Curse"" is equally preposterous, a primitive puppet head inside a transparent dome attached to a machine body--he's basically a Dalek with the organic bits visible on the outside. The ""monster"" of Peladon, fear of which drives so much of the action in both stories, is essentially a man in an ape suit with the head of Alf whom the Doctor easily tames with hypnosis and Venusian lullabies.

Both stories revolve around the struggles of Peladon's weak monarchs to maintain rule in the face of, first, a double-dealing High Priest in ""Curse"" and then sex discrimination and a miners' rebellion in ""Monster."" In ""Curse,"" you either warm to the supposed chemistry between King Peladon (played by David Troughton, son of Patrick) and Jo Grant (Katy Manning) or you don't (I didn't). I found Peladon's daughter and heir, Queen Thalira (Nina Thomas), in ""Monster"" an empty cipher, and Sarah Jane's feminist exhortations for her to step up to power sound hopelessly dated now.

The Special Features accompanying ""The Monster of Peladon"" include the second part of an enthusiastic, overreaching ""making of"" documentary on the Peladon saga; a contemporary television interview with voice actress Ysanne Churchman, who created the high-pitched nattering of Alpha Centauri (skip this); and a captivating retrospective on the Doctor Who novelizations penned by longtime script editor Terrance Dicks (a similar feature on the Doctor Who novels of Malcolm Hulke comes with ""The War Games""; don't miss either).",1303516800,,2550,5.306930693069307
876551,2,6304432410,"I personally love this story. I think it's very underrated and has some wonderful cliffhangers and exciting moments that most fans don't seem to appreciate. The restoration by the esteemed Doctor Who Restoration Team is wonderful as usual, and the extras are also top notch.

However, I feel I must protest against this price-gouching tactic of Warner Brothers/BBC Worldwide Video to separate the boxsets out so that they can charge more for each story. What could have been a boxset of 3 discs for about $39.95 becomes one 2-disc set for $32 and one 1 disc DVD for another $19. This is why this DVD gets only two stars. If you happen to be made of money, however, please feel free to buy this disc as it's really good.

PLEASE STOP SPLITTING UP THE BOXSETS FOR THE NORTH AMERICAN RELEASES, WARNER BROTHERS! It's not fair!

876552,5,6304432410,"""The Curse of Peladon"" was very good, and then I seen this one which is even better! More action and more plot twists is what makes this sequel so good.

The Federation is at war with Galaxy Five and needs a vital mineral found in Peladon's mines. But the ghost of Aggador is frightening the miners off. The Doctor suspects another conspiracy is at work. Now it's up to the Doctor once more to uncover the conspirators and save Peladon.

Action-packed and lots of plot twists which will keep you glued to the screen all the way through until the end. Highly recommended!",1275523200,,695,4.515873015873016
876553,4,6304432410,"For those who have this show placed solidly in their childhood or teen years, this is a great show, a great story in the Pertwee years which bridged Sarah from Baker backwards to Pertwee.  It was one of the first Ice Warrior shows we saw in America, and the monsters have always been important, so this was a special story for that element as well.  However, it always suffered from being slow and a dreary political muddle.

The ideas aren't so bad, and relate an interesting potpourri of social/labor/political ideologies and situations.  Thus it is less of a rollicking sci-fi adventure and more of a rollicking intrigue story.  There was nothing particularly purposeful within Peladon stories which gave the Ice Warriors a strong reason to be there.  Ice Warriors could have been men with guns or any other creature.  Resonance from returning to Peladon after 50 years was nice, but the story was a rehash with a slight twist.  Not the greatest offering of Doctor Who, but it isn't unwatchable.

Ice Warriors of the Troughton stories were the typically rousing monsters of Doctor Who: ""RAHR! I COME FROM THE UNKNOWN AND KILL!""  Ice Warriors in these Pertwee shows were more civilized, ambassadors, and were more along the lines of: ""Nice to meet you, RAHR! NOW I KILL YOU WITH PERMISSION!""

Pacing of these older shows have strengths the newer series don't have, because the writing and acting can connect to viewers better through heart.  On the other hand, the old shows are limited with effects and scripts and locations and technical aspects which might bore younger viewers used to modern pacing and writing conventions.

DVD commentaries for these 6 episodes are packed with people:
1-3 have Nina Thomas (Queen Thalira), Donald Gee (Eckersley), Ralph Watson (Ettis), Letts & Dicks, and Terry Hadoke (who?  what the-?)
4 has Hadoke (who?) returning with FANS of the show: Robert Shirman (writer of ""Dalek"" 2005 - wha?), Mark Alrdrige(who?), Phil Newman(why?), Kate DuRose(huh?)
5-6 has Hadoke (who?) moderating with Stewart Fell, Dicks & Letts, and Donald Gee

The actors' commentaries were great, but I never like the moderators they plug in, especially when they could be on headphones to prod people instead of in the room taking time and injecting directorial commentary that is distracting.  The fourth episode of the DVD has utterly boring commentary.  I'd rather they put such tracks on an further commentary level and have people involved in the show's production through all episodes.  It made sense when the animators on ""The Invasion""s  first animated episode had commentary, but these people had nothing worthy of inclusion on the track.  Now, months after Lett' death from cancer, it seems pitiable that we couldn't have had him on all episodes possible.  The producers, script editors, and lead actors are never dull on Doctor Who commentaries.

Disc 2 has a ton of extra little films and documentaries which combine the Peladon stories, the first Peladon story having only one disc.

A good deal.  Nice package of stuff.  Worth it for the dedicated Who fan.",1273536000,8,3081,4.9941176470588236
876554,5,6304432410,"Why can't amazon.com seperate reviews? vhs with dvd? dvd and vhs with blu ray?  they do not even make vhs tapes anymore. And few shows get reviews like doctor who does. Individual stories get trashed left and right and they seem to forget that this was a low budget sci fi tv series that was kid friendly and even today still is!  So this episode to me is exactly what I expected a decent far out space tale featuring  a cool performance from the great jon pertwee. The story isn't as good as some other stories but I don't think any doctor who story ever rated a one star review , not even time and the rani which is rather slapstick.

876556,4,6304432410,"Pencils ready?.........The Galactic Federation becomes embroiled in a war with Galaxy 5, Peladon becomes strategically important, being rich in a mineral vital to the war effort. Fed tech is brought in to speed things up, but only end up adding to the escalating clash between Peladon's old ways and new. Then add to that there's the ghostly visage of Aggedor appears attacking miners. Naturally this is when the Doctor and Sarah Jane Smith arrive, missing the Citadel again, some 50 years since the Doctor's visit with Jo. The Queen, the Daughter of the late King Peladon (of the Curse of Peladon) knows of the Doctor from her father, enlists him to find the cause of the manifestations of Aggedor. He guesses someone is deliberately trying to interrupt Trisilicate production, be it saboteurs or spooks, they seem to have succeeded when the miners decide to strike, then before long attack the Federation armory to get weapons. This further sets back Trisilicate supplies, so a human engineer in charge of the refinery, sends for Federation troops to help restore order. None of the involved parties want Federation occupation, especially when the ICE WARRIORS implement some ruthless Martian tactics. Martian ICE LORD Commander Azaxyr sole objective is to maintain Trisilicate production at all costs, creating political realignment: the Plebs and Patricians join forces in seeking to rid the planet of the Martians. Except for a raving MINER attempts to blow up the Citadel allowing for the Ice Warriors to impose martial law on the capital, imprisoning the Queen and her courtiers, and even killing another Peladonian Chancellor (wonder if this is in the job description)...then it gets complicated....well everything sorts itself out with some help from the Doctor and Sarah.

There are still some painfully cheesy moments, such as Sarah Jane explaining ""Women's Lib"" to the Queen, ""There's nothing ""only"" about being a girl."" Also the Doctor's hilarious `rassling match with the Miner Ettis in which it is clearly the late-great stuntman Terry Walsh and not Pertwee, but while ""Monster's"" plot is seems unnecessarily over-complicated, like it's predecessor ""Curse"" the enthusiasm for the material shines though all of the missteps. I guess the same can be said for all Classic Dr. Who.

Another important (atleast to me) note: the voice of Alpha Centauri is again played by Ysanne Churchman  worked as an actress on British radio, TV and film (returns as the Voice to voice the Spiders in Planet of the Spiders for the end of this season). She is my favorite thing about the Peladon stories, de-lightful!

876559,5,6304432410,"In the penultimate Jon Pertwee story, this sequel to The Curse of Peladon takes place fifty years after the Doctor's first visit, only this time, he has Sarah Jane in tow.  He was meaning to revisit Peladon (both the planet and king), but Thalira, Peladon's daughter, is the monarch.  High Priest Hepesh's successor is Ortron, who is chancellor and high priest.  And once again, they are in the middle of a crisis with many complications.
First off, entry into the Galactic Federation has only benefitted Ortron and his aristocratic lackeys.  The miners, led by Gebek, have worked harder and for the same rewards.  ""It's always been the same.  Work and sleep, little else... earn barely enough to feed our families.""  Gebek is a working class moderate, loyal to the queen, and more patient, but hotheaded radicals like Ettis, keep leading armed rebellions against Ortron.  The Doctor saves Gebek's life and gains a friend and ally in the miner.
Ortron, like Hepesh before him, dislikes the Doctor.  He thinks the Doctor is a spy for Galaxy Five, a power bloc that Federation are at war with.  However, Alpha Centauri, the one-eyed hermaphrodite hexapod, recognizes the Doctor and vouches for the Time Lord.
The crux of the problem is once again the spirit of Aggedor, who this time is vaporizing the miners digging for trisilicate.  They refuse to work with sophisticated machinery, like the sonic lance.  As for engineer Eckersley, who's in charge of the refinery, he's a non-political professional.  All he's concerned with is getting the trisilicate mined for the Federation.  Current technology is dependent on trisilicate, and whoever controls it wins the war.
The Doctor tries to be the voice of reason, getting Gebek to voice his grievances to the queen without Ortron's presence, and the queen to give the workers a better deal to cut the grass from under Ettis' feet.  At the same time, he thinks that Aggedor's manifestations are technological trickery by saboteurs.  However, just when he's cleared himself of some trouble, something else comes up that barely gives him breathing room.  Worse, the situation deteriorates to the point that a panicked Alpha Centauri calls in Federation troops under Commander Azaxyr, a ruthless Ice Warrior who immediately places Peladon under martial law and threatens execution of hostages unless the miners get back to work.
Of the guest actors Rex Robinson is solid as Gebek.  Nina Thomas (Thalira) plays the queen as another vulnerable, indecisive, but well-meaning ruler just like her father, but those large, deer caught in the headlights eyes really got me.
This time, the basis for the story is the miner's strike, whose poor handling of it led to Prime Minister Edward Heath defeat at the polls.  The Conservatives lost and Labour under Harold Wilson returned to office in 1974, the same year this story was broadcast.  However, a group of television professionals polled said the story reminded them of Poland in 1970, where a workers' uprising due to rising prices and unfair work incentives led to the resignation of General Secretary Wladyslaw Gomulka.  Others saw the miners' situation to that workers in Russian prior to the 1917 revolution, and they saw Ortron as symbolizing bureaucracy today.  The Doctor was the voice of reason, the real hero, saying ""there is an answer if you will listen to it.""  That's the problem, getting factions to listen.
A shot at woman's lib is given here, as Thalira, dominated by Ortron, seen as little more than a child, and made queen just because she was the only offspring of the king, tells Sarah of her weak position.  ""Things would be different if I were a man, but I'm just a girl.""  To which Sarah flat out tells her, ""There's nothing only about being a girl.  Never mind why they made you a queen.  The fact is, you ARE the queen, so just you jolly well let them know it!""
Though severely panned due to its 6 episode length and the back and forth fighting, defeats, fighting again, it surpasses its predecessor due to the multiple conflicts and politically-charged message, with Marxist sympathies and responsibilities and benefits of being part of a collective union.  Underrated and due for some reevaluation.",1074384000,14,4213,4.971469329529244
876560,3,6304432410,"I did not like the first Peladon story and I like this even less.
The plot is sort of OK but I do wonder why the BBC allowed the scientific illiteracy of an unseen enemy called Galaxy Five to be included in the show given the Corporation's mission to educate as well as entertain. The corruption of the Ice Warriors is also a little of given their militaristic society and harsh justice.
The plot is a weary rehash of the first featuring the worst of the first's characters, the abysmal Alpha Centauri.
The adventure could have been made into at most afour part story without losing any of it's coherence, if not shorter. The queen is too weak and the other characters seem to be running around like headless chickens. And we had to hear the Doctor singing to the monster...again.
It is not much of a story but has some twists. Not the best Doctor Who and, alas, not the worst.",1034121600,,877,4.419753086419753
