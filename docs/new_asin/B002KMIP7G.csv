8372121,1,B002KMIP7G,"My God, where do you start? If you want to blow some money on 22 minutes of the worst martial arts demonstations and questionable interpretations ~ buy this.  If, on the other hand, you really want to learn martial arts, or want a deeper understanding ~ DON'T BUY THIS.  I doubt any of the black belts in this video ever did bunkai or their kata performance would be above yellow belt techniques.  Some of the comments by the speaker, such as they don't do shime during Sanchin because of ""liabilities,"" makes you ask what other excuses and fantasy they created.  In short, it's simply the biggest crock of horse manure one could pack into one DVD.  If it was possible to give negative 100 stars, this would be the first candidate to come to mind.  A complete waste ~ avoid it like the plague!",1293494400,15,793,4.472222222222222
