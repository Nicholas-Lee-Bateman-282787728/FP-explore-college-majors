8096218,5,B000C7RPFO,"I have had one of these for ages and now I can finally do some more things with it.  The guy is really so much better than the old manual I could never get enthusiastic about.  All gizmos should have these DVDs instead of manuals.  How did you know I should have this, Amazon?  You are so clever.",1444348800,,296,4.051724137931035

8096221,5,B000C7RPFO,"A very good product that explains and shows you the way rather than letting you guess with trial and error with the manual.
Why you can only buy it from the American site beats me.
Why Roland do not supply this with the product which is not cheap i do not know.
Well worth the money though.",1362096000,,290,4.105263157894737
