7960768,1,B0000649KX,"Movies like this are best left on the drawing board. The action is weak, the performances are awful, the scripting is terrible, the effects are super cheap and the budget is extremely low. Why make a futuristic sci-fi movie when the budget does not permit decent effects, stunts or sets? Made-for-TV movies have better effects than this movie does. Anton Lewellyn (Richard Lynch) is The Recycler, a cyborg (cybernetic organism) gone bad. He trolls the vast wasteland in search of other cyborgs so he can recycle their body parts, which he sells to Lord Talon (Malcolm Mcdowell). Though he receives top billing, McDowell is only in the movie for two scenes, totaling perhaps five minutes. Casella Reese (Khrystyne Haje) is the first cyborg to ever become impregnated and The Recycler wants the reward for it. Evans (Zach Galligan) helps Reese fend off Lewellyn and his fellow cyborg turned evil, Jocko (Andrew Bryniarski). The writing is uninspired and clichd, replete with synchronized motorbike stunts and lines such as, ""Don't you see? He's using you!"" The final, epic battle in the movie is so bad it is painful to watch. It wouldn't be terrible if it did not take itself so seriously, but this is all extremely lowbrow and carelessly made for the undiscerning viewer who revels in trash cinema. The only reason to see this might be for the beautiful Khrystyne Haje, but even that is marginal at best.",1159920000,5,1404,4.9033613445378155
