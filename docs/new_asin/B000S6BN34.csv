Sadly Americans are too stupid to identify their REAL enemies(***hint***they AREN'T brown and they DO NOT embrace ""Islam""). GOVERNMENT not the church has been the purveyor of fear and terrorist activities.

Mr. Curtis does an excellent job in portraying that use of fear to manipulate and lead the entire world down the dark path which it finds itself on. The human mind is easily manipulated and Gustave LeBon does a top-rate job of relating this.",1312761600,,526,4.844444444444444
8204532,5,B000S6BN34,"most documentaries have a very big problem in that they use way too much background music (noise) that obscures what is being said. Lots of extraneous noise is not appreciated....especially when one is trying to listen carefully to what is being said (maybe with the volume up) and all of a sudden they blast you with an extremely loud sound as they do in this documentary.  I listen using headphones and my ears are still ringing from this. If sub-captions were provided, at least I could have tuned out the noise.  Aside from this, the documentary was excellent and told a very important message that we should all know and understand. I must have been pretty lucky as I must have gotten the very last copy..as I now see that Amazon has posted that this documentary is no longer available...hmmm!????I wonder why???",1227571200,,817,4.746478873239437
8204533,5,B000S6BN34,"The Power of Nightmares first aired on the BBC as a series of three one hour specials.  It was shown in a few theaters in the US, and quickly gained a reputation as an important work.

Curtis brings to light the connections between the US neo-con movement and the extremist muslim fundamentalist movement.  He also shows that the same charlatans who promote the threat from islamic terrorists are the very same people who promoted the Soviet threat (and before that the threat of Communisum in the 50's).

Curtis unflinchingly pulls back the curtain on what is essentially a conscious hoax designed to scare people into supporting virtually endless war and imperialism.

Those on the right won't like this message, and sadly will not learn the truth.  Even those on the left may not like this, as it is so at odds with the ""conventional wisdom"" of so-called mainstream culture.  None of which renders The Power of Nightmares one bit less truthful.

If you want to have the scales fall from your eyes and see and hear the unvarnished truth, buy this DVD, watch it, and share it with everyone you know.",1182556800,2,1100,4.722513089005235
8204534,5,B000S6BN34,"This is by FAR the best copy of this documentary on DVD that I have found.  It is on DVD-R but it played great in my DVD player, and on my computer.

This is a fascinating documentary about the origins and similarities between the American Neoconservatives and the Islamic Fundamentalists, using archive footage and interviews to describe their extremist agenda of paranoia and fear. Originally aired in the UK by the BBC just before the 2004 American elections, it has not yet been shown in the States because of its controversial nature.

This film explores the origins in the 1940s and 50s of Islamic Fundamentalism in the Middle East, and Neoconservatism in America, parallels between these movements, and their effect on the world today.

""Both [the Islamists and Neoconservatives] were idealists who were born out of the failure of the liberal dream to build a better world. And both had a very similar explanation for what caused that failure. These two groups have changed the world, but not in the way that either intended. Together, they created today's nightmare vision of a secret, organized evil that threatens the world. A fantasy that politicians then found restored their power and authority in a disillusioned age. And those with the darkest fears became the most powerful.

This DVD contains all 3 parts of the BBC Documentary:

I: Baby It's Cold Outside
II: The Phantom Victory
III: The Shadows In The Cave",1182470400,8,1425,4.941422594142259
