Yet I don't understand how some parents will prefer stupid films like ""the cat in the hat"", ""Scooby Doo the movie"" or ""the grinch"" (with so many inapropiate jokes,boring,and more than predictable), over this one, just because they come with a huge marketing campain.

 I wouldn't say it's fatntastic, its OK, absolutely ""white"" (innocent) in its content, and it has the kind of funny things kids under 6 love! (ask teletubbies,blues clues or Bubba)the typical cake in the face humor.

At least Capulina didn't have to use computer animation,sex jokes, or expensive effects to make little kids laugh, and it was done decades ago. And IN MEXICO.That's my opinion.",1102723200,4,720,5.076271186440678
8410246,1,B000065U5F,"This film deals with the comedian Capulina being a snitcher, and that is what the whole film deals with, yet another mediocre attempt at humor by the popular comedian, unless you are a fan of his stay away from this movie.",1039132800,2,222,4.439024390243903
