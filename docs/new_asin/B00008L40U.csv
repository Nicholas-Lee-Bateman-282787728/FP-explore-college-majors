7985167,3,B00008L40U,"I give this 3 stars because I think the movie is true to it's satirical intent.  It's a crazy, ridiculous, sick, nonsense of a cheap, 70s style crime spree film.  That's it-and nothing more.  I am glad to have it in my collection, but it's certainly not a great film.  The DVD itself is mediocre quality and the audio is very bad.",1197590400,,330,4.274193548387097
7985168,2,B00008L40U,"The sensitive writer is, of course, gay, though he doesn't seem to think so until the film is half over.  I got all the jokes and found 90% of them to not be funny.  This is just a bunch of testosterone-laden misogynistic schtick masquerading as a satire when it's in exactly the same position as what it seems to think it's making fun of.  Instead of being subversive, as it intends, it reinforces everything such a satire suggests that it dislikes.

The best scene, though, which earns it its extra star, is a self-reflexive moment in which an acting class, consisting of actors who have already appeared in the film go over the lines and comment on how bad the film is.  Unfortunately, scenes as self-reflexive as this are few and far between.  Weidman ultimately champions his heroes way too much, when their entire goal is to make derivative crap and make money, which is apparently Weidman's goal as well.

It's easy to compare this film to _Cecil B. DeMented_, which it precedes, but John Waters understands satire much better than Mark Weidman, though this film is so bad it might have inspired him.",1123545600,,1107,4.675257731958763
