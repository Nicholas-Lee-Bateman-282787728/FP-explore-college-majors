4987168,3,B006GQQL50,"I saw an early release of this and immediately liked it.  It was in a similar vein with that of Camp Scare and Abracadabra Scooby Doo.  Very funny and witty scenes and then...the gang break out into SEVERAL showtunes.  The first song was clever and I thought as a one shot, it was cool and different.  But that's just it...the rest of the video is little bits of plot with lots and lots of showtunes.  My 3 year old didn't care for it and he watches everything with scooby.  I'll let you decide your opinion.",1325030400,16,508,4.294736842105263

4987176,5,B006GQQL50,"We have almost every Scooby Doo episode, as well as, Scooby Movie. My granddaughter has loved Scooby since she was a baby. I used to play the songs when she was fussy..
And she perked right up. Now she's 5 and loves the story lines. We saw this one a year or so ago but didn't buy it. Mistake! It aired on Cartoon Network today. As soon as it ended she asked to restart it. Of course, i couldn't do that. I don't know which one of us was happier when I found it on Amazon. The price was great, one click purchase and Presto - we restarted the movie!

There's a lot of songs in this movie, but it's not so overdone that it feels like a musical. Daphne has been selected to be the Vampire's Bride and the gang is trying to stop the swamp wedding. The vampire and narrator characters are wonderful. The ""Cirq-de-Solei like"" show troop gives the movie a modern twist on an ancient story line.

I recommend without hesitation to all Scooby fans. Young and old(er) alike.

4987188,4,B006GQQL50,"I can't really get a handle on this one because one minute it's great and the next it's not very good. But the good outweighs the bad, so that's why I've given it four stars and not three, which is how I would have rated it after my first watch.
The story is all here, and it's an enjoyable one. I liked watching it unfold and it genuinely had me guessing at some points who was the villain. The gang all act like themselves, and most scenes with them all together are great, and there are even quite a few good laughs. All of this alone would have given it a five star rating. But they just had to make it a musical.
The songs are not ALL bad. In fact, the song ""Done With Monsters"" is excellent. It's catchy and well done and spectacularly animated. Just look at Fred's hair as he sticks his head out the van!! Seriously good stuff. I am still singing this song to myself.
Every other song is utterly worthless. They sound bad, they barely have a tempo, and all animation with the music numbers after the first one looks rushed and incomplete. For example, ""Scooby And Me,"" features some of the shoddiest animation in anything Scooby Doo since the bad episodes of What's New?. Shaggy is regularly off model and it looks like they forgot to color Scooby all the way for a few shots. Also, something that was very glaring was what appeared to be the wrong character model for Shaggy for a good ten minutes; he randomly had a rip at the top of his shirt and then, way later, a steak is thrown at him and rips his shirt in the spot the rip spread has been for several minutes. It was pretty distracting and seemed lazy to me.
All in all, it's a great plot, but it definitely could do without all but the first musical numbers.",1438560000,,1724,4.259146341463414

4987191,2,B006GQQL50,"Released in 2011, SCOOBY-DOO! THE MUSIC OF THE VAMPIRE is the seventeenth in the feature length Scooby-Doo cartoon series created specifically for the home market.  In this particular program, a close encounter with a giant cockroach monster has caused the gang to weary of monster hunts.  They decide to take a vacation and they let Velma pick the destination.  She takes them to Cajun country, where a small town is holding an annual vampire festival.  Needless to say, one of the vampires soon proves a bit too realand focuses on Daphne.

The Scooby-Doo movies aren't high art by any stretch of the imagination, but they are fun for kids and comfort viewing for adults who, like myself, recall the original cartoon series fondly.  But to be quite frank, THE MUSIC OF THE VAMPIRE is painful.  For some unknown reason, the creators have styled it like a Broadway musical.  Like a very bad Broadway musical.  Every now and then the characters stop and break into unexpectedly bad musical numbers while what little plot and energy the movie has grinds to an absolute halt.

That said, uncritical kids will probably be amused, and yes, the animation is pretty good.  But SCOOBY-DOO! THE MUSIC OF THE VAMPIRE really bites.

4987200,5,B006GQQL50,"Important Note: The official summary on both Amazon and IMDB is wrong.  There is no vampire movie in this movie, and Daphne doesnt have an acting job.  Heres a real summary:

The Scooby gang decide that they're going to go on a restful vacation to get away from the stress of solving mysteries.  Unfortunately, they leave the choice of destinations up to Velma.  She takes them to Vampire Palooza, a vampire-oriented festival in a town founded by the Van Helsing family.  It turns out that Velma is a fan of a teen vampire romance novel called Silverlight (Sappy and glittery according to the review on the cover of the book), and that the author is going to be at the festival, along with various other vampire-themed attractions.  Vincent Van Helsing, a descendent of the founders of the town, has written a more traditional book about vampires and is hoping that the funds will help him save his vampire museum.  The crown jewel of his collection is the coffin of a real vampire, Lord Valdronya, and when the Scooby gang attends a performance by a vampire theater troupe, the chant they perform seems to bring Lord Valdronya back to life.  What seems at first to be a very realistic performance soon takes a more sinister turn when they find Lord Valdronyas coffin empty, and the vampire is seen roaming the festival grounds, terrorizing the fake vampires and other festival attendees.  To complicate matters, the vampire, in accordance with his legend, is seeking a young woman who is pure of heart to be his immortal bride and has set his undead sights on Daphne (Velma: You know, Im pure of heart.  Does anyone think of kidnapping me? No!).  Can the Scooby gang solve the mystery, save Daphne, and lay this vile vampire to rest?  Well, it wouldnt be much of a story if they couldn't . . . but it may be the last time they let Velma plan their vacation.

This movie is kind of a musical, but fortunately, the songs don't overwhelm the story.  The songs are kind of a running joke, starting with the show tunes that Daphne insists on listening to when they're setting off on their road trip.  My only complaint about the show is that leeches are gross (they pop up every now and then).

IMPORTANT SPOILER ALERT!:
Most Scooby-Doo mysteries have a villain dressed up as a monster, but there are a few that have real monsters. If, like me, you prefer the fake monsters to the real ones . . . you won't be disappointed.",1409788800,,2419,4.575406032482599

4987205,3,B006GQQL50,"I love Scooby Doo and watch the movies with my children frequently. This one was different and in my opinion, not a good one.

4987207,3,B006GQQL50,"If you're a small kid that loves Scooby or you want an easy movie to laugh and poke fun at, be my guest.  However, I think this movie could have been a lot better if they had adjusted a few things.  Like, delete all the songs except for the summoning and the ones at the wedding.  Second, given Valdronya more screen time.  Heck, they should have just made him the main character because he stole every scene he was in.  I thought his true identity was a bit of a cop-out because there were several things that never got explained in the movie that pointed to him being real.
Make the vampire real, the star of the show, and delete most of the songs.  Those things alone could have made this movie awesome enough to stand up next to Zombie Island and Witch's Ghost.  Actually, bringing back the Hex Girls would have been an improvement over the actors and been in cannon for a brief spot since they love vampires and vampires have a thing for a trio of brides.",1384560000,2,960,4.3
4987208,3,B006GQQL50,"Well, here's my rundown. ""Zombie Island"" was great. ""Witch's Ghost"" had a strong punch. ""Alien Invasion"" had some good moments. I didn't much like ""Cyber Chase."" ""Legend of the Vampire"" was surprisingly good. ""Monster of Mexico"" had its moments. ""Loch Ness"" was interesting. ""Aloha"" and ""Where's My Mummy"" had their moments, but weren't the best. ""Pirates Ahoy"" was GREAT!

""Chill Out"" had a few cute moments. ""Goblin King"" was great. ""Samurai Ghost"" was strange, but interesting. ""AbraKadarbra Doo"" wasn't great, but it wasn't bad. ""Camp Scare"" was surprisingly good. ""Phantosaur"" was terrible.

Now onto this 17th chapter. The first thing to be aware of is that this is NOT a defining film like ""Pirates Ahoy"" or ""The Goblin King."" For one thing, Fred is absurdly dumbed down. This just doesn't work seeing that he is the leader. Another thing is that they talk about this 'vacation staying a vacation.' I'm sorry, but this is crazy. We all know the formula. They always seem to be on vacation. But it never stays a vacation. It just is something we can't accept at this point.

The story is basically this. Scooby and the gang head down south and they run across what appears to be some kind of festival of vampires. By this, I mean people dressing up like vampires. There is one woman who is selling vampire charms. And one man who claims to be a descendant of Abraham Van Helsing is clearly upset because his books aren't selling so well. Maybe I shouldn't hold this against the film, but most people know that Van Helsing was just a fictional character created by Mr. Stoker.

Then what appears to be a legitimate show staged by actors (who happen to be believers in vampires) turns into a seeming problem when a real vampire is released. It appears that he is after Daphne to make her his bride.

Trying to be fair, the movie isn't all bad. It does allow us to take some guesses. And as usual, we have to think of economics being the true reason behind the seemingly supernatural crime. The movie also explores the theme of people taking advantage of unrest to score political points. It turns out an overly religious  man wants to stomp out the crime himself. Not surprisingly, we find he is running for Mayor. I'm Catholic, so I'm not knocking religion. But religion can be misused, and an outward show of it can in fact be hiding  a personal ulterior motive.

It appears these actors have been promised some great rewards by the supposed real vampire if they deliver Daphne to him. And I better stop here so I don't ruin it for those who haven't seen it.

The main difference between this and other Scooby Doo films is that you will notice that there are SEVERAL times where the characters break into song. To be fair, some of them were charming. But you can't help but wonder if the music was a tool to compensate for a 'not so great' story.

The best way to finish is to say it was ok, and it had some interesting moments. But it certainly did not have the well written work of ""Pirates Ahoy"" or ""Camp Scare."" Nor did it have the innocent charm of ""Monster of Mexico."" It didn't have the frightening moments of ""Zombie Island"" or the later ""Big Top."" It didn't have the moral lesson of ""Blue Falcon."" And far less did it give us the chills from ""Goblin King."" (You're on your own now in a world that doesn't have the same rules as yours.)

This 17th film is ok, and it does have it's moments. And if you are looking for a musical Scooby, well this will deliver. But in my opinion, this is an ok at best film.",1382313600,,3520,4.510204081632653
4987209,2,B006GQQL50,"And it was just cheesy. I typically like Scooby Doo movies, and when they weren't constantly breaking into song, it was okay.",1381708800,2,125,4.7272727272727275

I mean, it's nice to see the usual mystery solving pattern, but throw in a few twists and turns and add in new things just to try it. That's why I like this one. It's different and it may not appeal to some scooby fans who like their mystery solving plain and simple without the bells and whistles. Kids will like the songs though not all are catchy at all.

4987219,2,B006GQQL50,"I find myself asking ""why?""  Why did scooby doo need a musical? Then I realize about half way through it: its because they had little to no plot and needed filler to make it add up to the needed 70ish minutes. Otherwise, they would have barely had a 20 minute episode on their hands.

With the most recent additions to the library, I thought they were actually getting pretty well on track.  Then this.  Horrible.  I only give it two stars because I can't give anything 'scooby doo' one star, no matter how bad.",1359244800,,511,4.3936170212765955

The film has good music and is very well made with some good characterisation of American life. The plot is a bit more unpredictable as in some more run of the mill scooby movies which makes it stand apart as well. Having said that it's a typical Scooby mystery with the usual scares. I found only the singing and song of the amusement park lady a bit unscooby like, but the others were great.
The music alone convinces me that it'll be a big hit with our family fans at home, it gives it a happy edge.
I recommend this film to all.",1336780800,,656,4.1328125

I still can't get used to shaggy's new voice and it always leaves a bit of a bitter taste in every new scooby movie, no matter how good they're made.

Scooby-Doo music of the vampire has some pretty good lines that made me laugh reallly hard. The first song fitted the plotnd I hate to admit it, but its been stuck in my head for a few now. The rest was sorta off and it felt like they were just trying to have showtunes in the movie. It was something new, but I wouldn't need another scooby musical I have to say..
The end was way too short! No real trap, no referral to why the vampire could fly and the connection to the crazy inventor was totally missing..
Speaking of which....
The crazy inventor shouldve been more involved - he was super cool and since it started with him, it shouldve ended with him as well.

So, all in all a good scooby movie, but there are way better ones which leads me to rating it with only 3 stars, sorry Scoob =/",1335916800,,1059,4.111111111111111

4987232,2,B006GQQL50,"I made it a point to rent this from Amazon (rather than buy) after the waste of time ""Phantosaur"" turned out to be...and was glad I did.  Scooby Doo as a musical was, in a word, awful, and makes me think someone got the idea to emulate the musical episode of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" (""Once More, With Feeling"") except whereas it worked for Buffy, here it just comes off as a tired attempt to stretch a venerable--and frankly poorly treated in the modern age--cartoon into something more it was never meant to be.

The storyline itself actually isn't a bad one, but with the heavy emphasis on being hip and comic (and musical), it kind of gets kicked into a corner; a more dramatic (as in old-style Scooby Doo) would have served better, for us adults who still enjoy Scooby Doo.  For kids, most of the asides would probably go over their heads or simply bore them.  If there is one small saving grace its that this one pays a bit of tribute to ""Danger Prone"" Daphne's reputation by making her the focus of the vampire's attention, but it's a tiny point of kudo in an otherwise forgettable mess.

Here's a hint to the people who keep coming up with this stuff:  quit trying to be hip and ""modern"".  It's not working.",1334361600,2,1217,4.430493273542601

4987234,5,B006GQQL50,"First and foremost I would like to state that any reviews with less than three stars are not true Scooby fans.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with this title.  From the reviews I read I was actually expecting this Scooby movie to be a full on musical....It's not.  It's the typical 'new' Scooby gang solving a super cool mystery with a few musical numbers to add to the mystery.  Also, the musical scores are really good.  Actually, Music of the Vampire reminds me of the original Scooby movies done back in the 70's.  The only thing I would like to have seen in this movie would have been the addition of the Hex Girls :) All in all, if you like Scooby-Doo then you'll like this movie.

Painful to watch and I wouldn't even recommend it for dedicated Scooby Doo fans.  It's like they had a good idea for a ""What's New Scooby Doo"" 20 minute episode and needed something to turn it into a movie.  By far one of the worst Scooby movies ever made.",1332806400,2,514,4.347368421052631
4987237,4,B006GQQL50,"Our 4 year-old LOVES this movie because of the songs. They really need to do more musical Scooby's and leave out the super scary parts. That, and the gang not seeming to care too much about Scooby and Shaggy, were the drawbacks. Scooby is supposed to be about silliness and fun, that is why our son likes the tv shows. The movies tend to be too tense and stressful and scary. Some suspense is fine but the movies usually have way too much. We gave the movie 4 stars for the great songs and animation. Otherwise, I hope the Scooby Doo franchise does more musicals & writes the characters as more kind to each other, more goofy, and more fun in the future. I mean, isn't it about time the rest of the gang stop telling Shaggy and Scooby ""it's all in your mind?"" :) Btw, we LOVED when Shaggy asks Fred, who says ""There's nothing to worry about you guys"" - ""Yeah, like how many times have we heard that before Scoob?""

The ""story"" is hit and miss between bizarre musical numbers.  And calling them musical numbers is being very generous.  I suppose everyone is entitled to a bomb now and again.

4987242,1,B006GQQL50,"First, I love Scoobydoo. I am a parent of 3 teenagers so you can figure out my age.
Unfortunately, this latest release was sad. Scoobydoo does not need showtunes.  Repeat NO SHOWTUNES, NO MUSICAL NUMBERS (by the gang)
Having rock & roll vampire girls is one thing. Having a new Rock & Roll theme song was great.  But, having the Mystery gang sing is not.  Especially because most cannot sing in character.
My youngest wanted to fast forward through the musical numbers!

And the writing was sad - the whole flying shoes was left completely unfinished.
Where were the chase scenes in and out through doors?  When were Scooby and Shaggy bait to catch the monster?  Where was Fred's failed trap? Where were the scooby snack bribes?  Had the writers ever seen the original series?

Also, Amazon - your summary of the movie is wrong. This has nothing to do with Daphne in a Vampire movie.

A proper summary:
The Mystery gang takes a vacation to a place of Velma's choosing. It is down in the bayou - NOTE: Vampires and the bayou do not go together! - Where they meet a friend of Velma's who is an heir of the famous vampire hunter Van Helsing. Van Helsing is an author of Vampire stores not doing so well, who follows around a carnival-like vampire show Vampire Palooza, also not attracting many visitors. Of course, there is a mystery to solve and the gang do their thing, mostly, and with showtune-like numbers, to meddle enough and solve it.

The new 3D effects in the drawing were interesting - but really Scoobydoo looked best in the late 60s! There is no need for the fancy cartooning. Go back to the original style. Though it was fairly easy to tell what was drawn and what was computer generated.

My recommendation: Enjoy it on Cartoon Network, but show the producers you want the original Scoobydoo Mysteries back and do not buy this video.",1330732800,14,1845,4.577507598784194

That said, we turn to Music of the Vampire. It's really unlike any other Scooby movie ever made but at the same time it's remarkably familiar. I really enjoyed watching it. Sure, not all the songs are amazing but it's a whole lot of fun and there are at least 3 genuinely wonderful musical numbers in the film. It's a fun little mystery with the voice cast at the top of their games and singing(!) except for Mindy Cohn. All in all, I am very pleased with this new flick and I wouldn't be opposed to another musical installment of Scooby and the Gang!",1325548800,13,749,4.201388888888889
