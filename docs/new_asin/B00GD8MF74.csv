6071966,5,B00GD8MF74,"(Mrs. Seasparrow32) I will be honest I never write these reviews but this is a great movie. You may know this music even if you may not recognize the titles. Proclaimers (80's band) have brought us classic's like 'I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles),' 'Over and Done With,' 'Letter from America,' 'Let's Get Married,' 'Jean,' and 'I'm on My Way.' Currently the movie is only available on European players or European-capable players. The music in the movie was a little shocking at first. The drastic change was adjusting to females singing parts of the songs in soprano versus the mellow Proclaimers sound that the twins have. I have watched this movie over 40 times while doing dishes or stuff around the house. It is a simple love story, 2 generations, 3 couples. The setting is Edinburgh, Scotland so the brogue is easy to understand. The songs seem to melt in perfectly and suit the situations. The songs were better suited to the story than Mamma Mia. I do enjoy Mamma Mia but there are some rough transitions in the show. The actors obviously had a good time making the movie. They got a classic dramatic actor Peter Mullan to sing the song Jean, he has a rough voice but it seemed to work. I haven't seen the original ending before they splurged 500,000 pounds to do a big production ending. I enjoy the big production ending. They do have a cameo of the twins (Proclaimers: Craig and Charlie Reid) during the second scene of the movie. They appear annoyed with the two main actors as they are singing and dancing down the road. Their disdain makes me laugh. The show has a strong rating of 92% on rotten tomatoes, as least as of today. There are 13 Proclaimers songs in the show, all together. All and all, great show! I hope you get a chance to see it.",1406073600,3,1751,4.526813880126183
6071967,5,B00GD8MF74,"I admit it, Im Scottish.  But I was still a skeptic approaching a movie touted as MacMamma Mia.  Still, got a group of friends round, handed out a wee dram here and there, and sat back.  And from just a few minutes in  I realised I was going to enjoy this.  Doing for The Proclaimers what Mamma Mia did for Abba is the pitch, but do we really need another jukebox musical?  The answer lies in the songs themselves its not a question of whether you like The Proclaimers (though I defy anyone not find at least a few of their songs catchy enough to become your earworm of the year).. its their lyrics.  The songs are full of earthy lines  working class lyrics, as a friend of mine put it.. and it makes them feel universal.  You might not know Edinburgh, but you're going to invest in how these characters feel  some of my friends were undoubtedly dabbing their eyes at times.  It says a lot for the universality of the lyrics that my audience made up of friends from a variety of nationalities, indeed, spanning several continents, all enjoyed.  The story has been written round the lyrics in the same way Mamma Mia was  yet the story feels true, and the lyrics really do feel like they were written just for that situation.  For those that know their songs there is undoubtedly a measure of fun to be had seeing the songs coming  wait a minute, did he says his wifes name is Jean?  That letter, is it from the US..??
Paired with these songs, Edinburgh, specifically Leith, is undeniably basking in sunshine, and looks frankly superb.  The photography manages to make things look crisp and bright outside, yet still get the tone right in the slightly darker (metaphorically) scenes.. it feels like a movie, in other words  not a  TV special.
So, take it from someone who is not a musical fan or indeed a huge supporter of the romantic drama, this is just great fun, uplifting, and yes, I cant help saying it even though everyone else has  the feel-good movie of the year.",1403740800,16,1970,4.449720670391062
8622258,5,B00GD8MF74,"I bought this movie (though I had never heard of it) because it was a musical and others gave a great review of it.  My brother viewed it skeptically as he is not a musical fanatic like I am, but he loved it too!  Great songs sung by a great cast!  A genuine surprise!  Beware, this movie is not available in the US VERSION",1499472000,,323,4.0
8622259,5,B00GD8MF74,This is a fabulous musical. Please be aware though that it doesn't play on an DVD player made in the USA.,1497484800,,105,4.0476190476190474
8622260,5,B00GD8MF74,"It was hard to get into at first, not because of the dialect but because of the slow story line. Then it started to move and I was hooked. Wonderful film!",1473638400,,154,4.0
8622261,5,B00GD8MF74,"I have not seen, or had even heard the songs that the movie used from THE PROCLAIMERS. I am from the United States and ordered a copy of the film through Amazon. It would not play on my DVD player (which really is an XBOX 360 anyway), but it DID play on my computer. So it would be great, for the film to be more easily distributed in the States, but you can still order through Amazon and find a device to play it on (in my case a laptop) if you are really determined to see it in the US. I found out about the film, by being exposed and watching other work of Antonia Thomas who plays Yvonne in Sunshine on Leith.  She is very brilliant and talented, and her work is the most I've enjoyed an actress's since Ellen Page (more Page's early stuff than now). And I was surprised (yet not overly surprised - via the skills she displayed in other things I had seen her in) that Ms. Thomas's singing ability is as stunning and talented as the rest of her.  The rest of cast was great too: George MacKay, Kevin Guthrie, Jane Horrocks, Peter Mullan, Freya Mavor, etc., they were all wonderful.  The songs were very catchy and beautiful lyrically, and the pacing of the film was very well done in addition to the rest.  All the actors did a splendid job singing and acting.  The story itself dealt with all the familiar themes of love, circumstance, illness, age and even touched on war - and how people interact and cope with each other and those trials along the way. But the mood was light, and heart filling - the lyrics and singing hopeful and filled with love.  As others have said, it was just a feel good, well done, love and fun filled piece of art, that is worth anyone's time who has time to watch, and doesn't mind a little singing with their movie.",1455235200,3,1753,4.265060240963855
8622262,3,B00GD8MF74,"The songs are great.
The plot, not so much.
Thay could have used a tad more imagination. I found the story a bit weak overall.
Anyways the actor's performances and the music make this film worthy of a watch.",1446854400,,207,4.333333333333333

Now, a message does appear to that effect but did NOT when I purchased this particular product.
