7908088,5,B00000F6G5,Great product!,1415664000,,14,6.5
7908089,3,B00000F6G5,"Its ok, but it does show that people don't understand what makes a commander. Everyone thinks they can do a better job until they are in charge. This series is a good example of it. Good for starters in Anime. Another good one for beginners",1381017600,,240,4.355555555555555
7908090,5,B00000F6G5,My only con with this is that there are only two DVD's and so much further this show can go. But the show (what is available) is very well done for it's time!,1366156800,,158,3.8181818181818183
7908091,5,B00000F6G5,I've watched some episodes a friend of mine told me to watch then decided to get the dvds. I wish there was more dvds in the English language. Glad to see that they still have few episodes on each dvd. Worth watching and those who I told about the series as well love it too.,1365724800,,275,4.0181818181818185
7908092,4,B00000F6G5,"All things considered, this is a pretty decent series. For a kid's show, there's a relatively fair amount of tragedy in each episode. I had some gripes with the plot, but that's because I forgot it was a kid's show. My only problem with it is that it could've been significantly better considering all the opurtunities that it opened.",1281657600,,334,4.677966101694915
7908093,5,B00000F6G5,"I was first introduced to this series on Cartoon Network like, 2 or 3 years ago. It wasn't extremely awesome or had beautiful graphics but there was something about it that I loved. I don't think I ever finished watching the series and they quit airing it so I wasn't too happy about that...I'm so excited and can't wait for it to get here. I know that if my friends watched it they wouldn't like it but it's so awesome to me!",1180828800,4,426,4.2073170731707314
7908094,5,B00000F6G5,"Cyborg 009 is a great introduction to the world of anime.  The story has a nice way of showing the difference between good and evil.  A couple of the stories can also encourage a discussion between you and your kid(s) about why something turned out the way it did or why a particular decision was made.  Don't get me wrong, this anime is not aimed at just young kid(s).  The story is interesting enough to hook you and a teenager into watching it.",1169683200,5,447,4.349397590361446
