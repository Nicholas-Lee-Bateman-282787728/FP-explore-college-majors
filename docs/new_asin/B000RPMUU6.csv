8202316,4,B000RPMUU6,"Ariane and Lena (the first-rate French actress Marion Cotillard), are two sisters with a very dynamic and unstable sentimental life. Ariane recreates her own personal fantasies writing photo novels for an entertainment magazine. She uses to pick up part of her own experiences as well her sister too.

Each one of them keeps an illusion. Ariane tries to put in context her fervent desire with a wealthy man, Farid and her sister  is bored about Francois. But both of them have two outsider candidates, a Spanish worker and a famous violinist.

Once more, comes to our mind the famous statement: ""The life has much more imagination than us.""",1242259200,,640,4.907407407407407
8202317,4,B000RPMUU6,"The 2008 Oscar winner for Best Actress, Marion Cotillard, is a quite special talent, whose work is just beginning to be known in the US. The overwhelming laudatory notices for LA VIE EN ROSE, plus Cotillard's triple win of the British, French, and American Academy Awards (and some 22 other awards) for playing Edith Piaf, are cinematic history by now. But this artist does not need make-up artists to assist her in ""disappearing"" into a role.  She's known for that, and for being able to handle a wide genre of parts in comedy, drama, romance, and ""pop-art"" movies. She's a true chameleon of acting.

This film is one of the first in which Cotillard demonstrated this ability. She made five films in 2005 and five more in 2006; one of the latter was YOU & ME, and she had a leading role as one of two sisters. Lena, a cellist, is quite internal and shy.  She plays with a city orchestra, but doesn't feel she has the ability to solo.  In a longterm relationship with a teacher, she finds herself attracted to a celebrity violinist, who's also interested in her.  Cotillard's ability to hide in a role is seen here for perhaps the first time, given the size of the part; Lena wears baggy clothes and flat shoes; her hair is lanky and poorly-cut.  Her lack of confidence is apparent, yet once again the anguish over her conflicted feelings is obvious.

The other sister, Ariane, a writer of photo-romances, is in love with a philanderer. The film is basically about the sisters' relationship and their quest for true love. Later in the film,  Lena gains strength and confidence; Cotillard's walk changes, she's in high heels, and her approach to life and newfound sense of self are obvious.  Other winning elements are the women's friends and an adopted Jack Russell terrier. Finally, Cotillard's cello technique is quite realistic. I liked this small sincere film and would encourage others to see it, particularly those who are exploring Cotillard's career (some 40 movies since she was 16).",1210896000,2,1992,4.767441860465116
