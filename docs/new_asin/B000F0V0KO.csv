2547733,1,B000F0V0KO,"My two and a half year old son loves this movie...and ONLY for the train.  The animation is poor compared to Dreamworks, Pixar/Disney.  They have big actors as ""co-stars"" to a poorly cast ""main character"".  Hearing Doogal speak absolutely ruins this movie.  But like any parent would say...if it makes the kids happy so be it...for adults it just makes you wish for a mute button.",1149638400,,380,4.712121212121212
2547734,4,B000F0V0KO,"This is a simple, sweet story that is definitely for littler kids. I suspect the people who have given the film a bad rating here were disappointed by it's ""lack"" of mature humor that is so brilliantly scripted in movies like Shrek. Monster Inc., or The Incredibles (I frankly found this the beauty of the film and quite refreshing). The animation is also more focused on an illustrated look rather than realism. So, if you're an adult without kids, ignore this film.

BUT, if you have little ones (mine are 3 1/2 and 18 months), definitely buy or rent this film.  I'll be honest, it isn't a film that has such impact that you keep talking about it (like Incredibles or Shrek or Robots). It's simply a sweet children's story with a good plot that relates the dangers of selfishness and self-centeredness and the benefits of friendship and teamwork very well.  It also shows that even the most misguided of us can be redeemed by our good actions. It's something you'd see on the Disney channel and worth adding to your children's library of ""good message"" movies.

I personally would love to see it with the original British cast (Dame Judi Dench and Sir Ian McKellan, thankfully, remained in the film...and I loved the comic performance of Bill Hader as Soldier Sam!).  I think the American cast was mixed oddly in the casting room office, some of the choices work, some don't. Two very odd choices were the use of Jon Stewart as the villian and Whoopie Goldberg as Ermintrude the Cow and I think they somehow work once you get over the juxtaposition of the voices to the characters. Jon Stewart pulls it off because he's so darned sardonic. I'm still trying to decide if Whoopie truly works as an opera singing cow.... Daniel Tay as Doogal...ehh...nothing to write home about. Jimmy Fallon portrayed the laid-back, hippie-esque Dylan the Rabbit with ease, of course. I loved William H. Macy as Brian, his calm voice fits the country Snail beautifully.  Fallon and Macy (along with Hader) were probably the best performances in the film.",1148774400,11,2037,4.740112994350283
2547735,2,B000F0V0KO,"After seeing Hoodwinked and enjoying it, I looked forward to this movie, by the same makers.  Also, with talent like Kevin Smith, Chevy Chase, Whoopi Goldberg and William H. Macy, I had high expectations.  I was very disappointed.

The movie makes a few cultural references, which is amusing, but not really funny. There are very few actual jokes, and characters that are not at all developed after the initial introduction. The wizards, good and evil, look like Jack-in-the-Boxes which have escaped their boxes, which seems odd and unnecessary. Their powers come from their pizza-box-guy stereotype mustasches, which is sort of cute.

Small children will probably enjoy the brightly colored scenes and the triumph of good over evil, but I'd give this one a miss if you're over 6.  I gave it two stars because it wasn't so bad that I had to turn it off, though I came close.",1147651200,9,874,4.8389261744966445
2547736,5,B000F0V0KO,"It's a little slow for grown-ups, but overall it's a great, age appropriate, entertaining movie for kids. My 4 yr old loved it in the theater twice and we can't wait to own it.",1145664000,7,176,4.205882352941177
2547737,1,B000F0V0KO,"not ""Doogal""  If they can't include the original version of the film with the atrocity they made out of ""Dougal"", then it's not worth getting. I've not seen Doogal, and I have no desire to after getting ""The Magic Roundabout"" on Region 2 dvd.  COMPLETELY different films.  See Dougal and his friends as they should be.",1144972800,7,318,4.642857142857143
2547738,3,B000F0V0KO,"I've often found that young children go into animated movies with the same mindset: they'll love it even before the lights in the theater go dim. And what's not to love? Everything is bright, wacky, and fun, no one gets killed, and a happy ending is virtually guaranteed. Of course, adults have a different set of standards for the films they'd prefer to see. Sure, a family film is okay; at least then there's something for everyone. But if they're forced to sit through a cartoon made entirely for young children, then there's a lot to be desired. ""Doogal"" is definitely a children's film, and for them, I would recommend it. But for adults, even those who have young children ... well, it may be something you'll want to pass on.

A completely computer generated adventure, ""Doogal"" has everything a child would love: lots of vivid colors, talking animals, talking toys, juvenile comedy, and harmless dialogue. Of course, the visuals will probably distract them from the basic good vs. evil storyline. Then again, they may not; it's a genre that's been utilized in countless numbers of cartoons, most of which they've seen on more than a couple of occasions (and for that we can thank the folks at Disney). It's a genre that also has the ability to close cultural gaps. The film itself is proof of that; it was originally produced in France, only to later be re-dubbed by English speaking actors. The script was also completely rewritten by American born Butch Hartman, the creator of Nickeloden's ""Fairly Odd Parents.""

Nothing was complex or detailed as far as the plot is concerned, and the characters were appropriately made one-dimensional (a plus, considering the average child's attention span). In what was obviously crafted to be an under aged salute to the ""Lord of the Rings"" Trilogy, ""Doogal"" is the story of a puppy and his quest to save the world. When the evil sorcerer Zeebad (Jon Stewart) is accidentally released from his merry-go-round prison, he takes his revenge by covering the whole world in snow and ice. Things only go downhill when he steals three magic diamonds, the ones that have the ability to freeze the sun permanently. If there's to be any hope of thawing the frozen landscape, then the diamonds have to be restored. (It should be noted here that Zeebad is a metal spring. That's right: a metal spring.)

Here enters the good sorcerer Zebedee (Ian McKellen, whose character is also a metal spring). He puts together a ragtag fellowship specifically for this dangerous quest. It's led by Doogal (Daniel Tay), a self-serving, candy obsessed young mutt whose best friend, Florence (Kyle Minogue), has been imprisoned by a wall of ice. If he's to succeed in saving her--as well as in saving the world--he must learn to think of others and not just himself. Helping him are his friends, including: Dylan (Jimmy Fallon), a guitar playing rabbit who is always sleepy; Ermintrude (Whoopie Goldberg), a cow who dreams of musical stardom (despite the fact that she can't sing to save her life); and Brian (William H. Macy), a levelheaded snail who happens to be in love with Ermintrude. (Don't bother asking why; remember, this is a kid's film.) Completing the list of characters in the unseen narrator, voiced by the Academy Award nominated Judi Dench.

Yes, ""Doogal"" is the kind of film kids would love. Unfortunately, I'm an adult, and I couldn't help but analyze it from an adult's perspective. There was just so much that didn't work for me, not the least of which was animation that couldn't hold a candle to the likes of Dreamworks or Pixar. Every shot looked like an amateurish, half-hearted attempt, qualities that would only be dismissible were it a weekly cartoon on Playhouse Disney or Kids' WB. I'm not saying the characters had to look realistic: if anything, that would hurt the movie more. I just felt that the graphics people could have put a little more effort into things like texture, lighting, and movement. I also would have liked it if the characters' mouth movements were redone. I've already told you that this was originally a French film. Because of that, the voices were out of sync with the mouths. At first I could let it go, but after a while I found it to be distracting and detrimental to the movie.

Another problem was a noticeable clash of comedic styles. Visually speaking, the audience is immersed in a toddler's dream world: completely sterile, fantastic, and loaded with a mishmash of seemingly unconnected creatures. (Who'd have thought you'd see a film where humans, animals, and toys coexisted?) This in and of itself works. However, it loses cohesion when you factor in Hartman's Americanized dialogue. Almost every joke in this film is a pop culture reference, something that seemed too removed from the genre and too mature for young audiences. Would four-year-olds understand any of the references to ""Lord of the Rings""? For that matter, would they understand the references to ""Star Trek,"" ""King Kong,"" or ""Indiana Jones""? I hope they can, because they all find their way into the movie.

Even some of the voice styles worked against the movie. Case in point: Dylan the rabbit, whose guitar playing called for him to sound like a wasted rock star. Fallon's tired and consistently disinterested performance might have worked had ""Doogal"" been aiming for a preteen audience. I don't know; I just think that if the filmmakers insisted on including jokes adults would get, they should have veered away from the cruder gags only children would appreciate. The best example is a moose (Kevin Smith) that continuously passes gas.

I guess this review is basically a warning to parents: your child in all likelihood will love ""Doogal,"" but you in all likelihood will not. It's just not meant for anyone over the age of eight. I suppose that's not a bad thing; kids enjoy seeing movies that live up to their standards of entertainment. I still think it would have been better if the humor had meshed with the film's overall look. But what do I know? As I said earlier, I'm an adult.",1143936000,10,6048,4.843326885880077

2547796,1,B000F0V0KO,"What was originally some critically acclaimed kid's movie in Britain was dubbed over and the story was tweaked to dump into American cinemas. What follows is one of the worst children's movies in recent history that was quickly blocked from memory like a rape.

There is zero jokes, zero plot, and zero effort to anything going on in this movie. The famous voice actors obviously don't give two s***s about the movie and were probably laughing at the dumb script when the mics were off. The animators didn't care about lip synching because the characters mouths will be moving all over the place when they're just saying ""ok"". The jokes? What jokes? You mean pop-culture references? In one scene a bunch of skeletons are walking towards one of the characters and one of them just blurts ""PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN!""... DOHOHOHOHOHOHOH I GET IT! PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN IS A MOVIE I RECOGNIZE, HOW FUNNIE! Other gut-busting jokes include Lord of the Rings/The Matrix/Pulp Fiction references. Yes, kids are all going to be chuckling when the rabbit goes ""Zeb's dead baby, Zeb's dead"".

What this cacophony of s*** really represents underneath the nonsensical animation is Europe's complete disdain for American audiences. The Magic Roundabout got released in France without dumb edits, but for the American version someone decided ""eh the stupid 'Muricans aren't going to understand this brilliant story, let's dumb it down and throw more fart jokes and Lord of the Rings references in it!"" ""Stupid Americans are going to lap that s*** up, hahahahaha!"" And yet it still got panned across the country and quickly forgotten.

Another person who did something similar was George Sluizer, who made The Vanishing, a great French thriller where it ends with a man getting buried alive. A few years later the same director made an English version of the Vanishing for Americans but reworked the ending to be happy! Yes the man that was buried alive is dug out at the last moment (wouldn't want to kill that suspense would we?) and gets vengeance on the bad guy. And yet again Americans hated it. Another example of this is the infamous 4kids, where they take foreign anime shows and make them more 'child friendly' by replacing guns with finger pointing, replacing beer with juice, and replacing black skin for pure white skin(no seriously).

You know, I hope these people keep doing this, it's really kind of funny just to see how much veiled contempt is behind these 'adaptions'.",1352764800,2,2472,4.935096153846154

2547799,3,B000F0V0KO,"I watched ""Magic Roundabout"" in the UK as a small child in the late 60's, so I was very curious to see ""Doogal"" for myself, despite some very negative reviews on this site.  For the $ investment I figured it was pretty low-risk.  I found the animation, particularly the backgrounds, to be quite lovely -- a refreshing change from the sometimes too-slick CGI animation found in US productions.  I would agree with other reviewers that the plot line was pretty weak, and the dialogue all over the map in terms of pop-culture references.  I also felt that the US voice (re-)casting was not as well-chosen as it could have been.  Jon Stewart was not in the least frightening as Zeebad, the evil wizard, he simply came across like a mean jerk who was having a bad day.  In the ""Making of..."" bonus feature, I got the impression that the US producers encouraged a lot of improvisation from the actors in the recording booth.  Much of this made its way into the final production and would account for the scattered, disjointed feeling overall.  Too bad this wasn't released with both UK and US voice tracks, as ""Robbie the Reindeer"" was.  To sum up, ""Doogal"" is a nice video for small children with a positive message and pleasantly out-of-the-ordinary visual appeal.

Since I first submitted this review, I've done some research on the original Magic Roundabout broadcast on BBC, and there is very little similarity between that series and this film, besides the likeness of the characters.  The BBC episodes were less than 5 minutes long and were almost a stream-of-consciousness dialogue from narrator Eric Thompson (father of actress Emma Thompson), dubbed over the original French stop-motion animated films.  A number of these episodes are posted on YouTube for those who might be interested, and there is a dedicated website as well.",1334188800,,1833,4.877419354838709
2547800,1,B000F0V0KO,"Do not listen to any of these people who are giving this positive reviews because their kids who are 2 or 3 enjoy it so much.  Kids who are 3 love to cook unsupervised in the kitchen, eat candy until they get sick, & run in circles until they puke, but do you let them?  This movie is pure trash.  I have watched over 300 animated movies & this is by far the worst, far eclipsing Luke and Lucy: The Texas Rangers if you've seen that cinematic marvel.  Of all the movies I've ever watched in my entire long life, thousands, this will reign at the top above movies I NEVER thought would be dethroned.

Some people enjoy anything, but this is the most ridiculous story told in the most ridiculous fashion & the cast of animated creatures is together the most annoying & irritating group ever assembled in a big production animated film.  Keep in mind that on amazon even the worst movies have some positive reviews, some are plants by the DVD sellers & movie people & others are just people who like to be disagreeable to whatever the prevalant opinion is.  Trust the number of us saying it is a 1.

Those who say it is great for your kids are lying to you.  The dialogue is not written with kids in mind, only adults who don't understand humor or even fairy-tale logic.  Your kids need to grow up to think, not be dumbed down.  Those at my local nursing home who are there for frying their brains on meth would also be riveteted to their seats during it, but that doesn't mean you should watch it.  Erase taste or the majority of your brain cells & yeah, then it would be great.

It starts out telling you it is a ""far away land"" that is ""not entirely like our own"" & then references to the pop culture of our world are heard over & over throughout, movies you might not even want your kids to start wanting to watch, like the Matrix series.  It is true that it is ""not entirely like our own"" world, because humor there is not based on the same principles as our world.  Oh, & BTW, where are the parents in this movie anyhow?  Where is the back story to these stupid springing wizards?  They don't even introduce the main character in a way that would make you like him at all.  It feels like a sequel from the start.  It is likely the most illogical animated movie you will ever encounter.

If you have any depth, you will spend the movie despising the main characters & their smarmy ridiculously dialogued goodness (especially the narrarator) & almost if not fully routing for the villain, who is the only one with an even slightly entertaining dialogue in the movie.  We never find out why the villian wants to freeze the world & upon viewing the plastic people of that world, don't know why the ""good"" characters really would want to save it.

It is by Pathe!, note that 'tic' was inadvertantly omitted.  No one needs to lighten up, as other posters have said, they need to grow up & their kids need to grow up without having to be subjected to this mindless piece of drivel.  Please heed my warning.  Run! Run! Save yourselves!  I have never done a review before, but since I can never get my wasted 77 minutes back, I thought perhaps, I could try to save yours.

P.S. Don't trust the 2 & 1/2 star average, as stars are not representative!  This is not a 50-50 thing as to whether it is good or bad.  As of my post, these are the numbers of people & the stars they have given- 30 give a 1, 5 give a 2, 8 give a 3, 6 give a 4, 9 give a 5.  That is 3.3X more people that give it a 1 than a 5, but the 5's count for more in the average which is totally not representative.  A 1 should be as powerful as a 5 in determining the count.  If it was, the stars would show very differently as 35 in the bottom two would far outweigh 15 in the top two & it's average would discount the middle score & it would be at 30% or 1.5 stars which would be closer to accurate.  Plus one who put a 3 gave severely negative reviews!  Don't trust the planted scripted fake sounding positive reviews & ignore the people whose kids would enjoy watching singing grass grow.

2547804,3,B000F0V0KO,"After completing the generally ill-received film Doogal, I found myself pondering a single question: How in the world could something like this happen?  Surely Harvey Weinstein finds himself wondering the same thing.  I mean on paper (and even in trailers), this one looks fantastic: It's got an absolutely stellar cast, a host of original characters, a plot that mimics large scale fantasy adventures like Lord of the Rings, and a massive following in its native UK (where it's known as The Magic Roundabout).

However, in execution, this one manages to fall victim to just about every conceivable mark or poor filmmaking:  It's poorly developed, oddly paced, downright boring at times, and certainly not as funny as a film featuring the likes of Jimmy Fallon, Chevy Chase, Jon Stewart, Whoopi Goldberg, Kevin ""Silent Bob"" Smith, and Bill Hader (to mention a few) should be.  But before we get to all that, let's take moment to break down the plot structure shall we?

This is the story of Doogal (Daniel Tay), a fuzz ball candy-loving pooch who, after a series of irresponsible (and rather annoying) mishaps finds himself embarking upon a mission to save the world and perhaps more importantly his beloved owner Florence.

See it turns out that in the center of town, there exists a roundabout (that's a merry-go-round to you and me) that, for whatever reason, serves as the eternal prison for an evil spring-legged wizard named Zeebad (Jon Stewart).

Doogal, through an obsession for candy and a blatant act of deceit, manages to free the evil Zeebad from his tomb and with that his dastardly plan of freezing the earth forever with the power of three mysterious diamonds scattered about the kingdom.

Never mind that Doogal can single-handedly be attributed to causing the entire disaster in the first place, we're supposed to cheer on this little fur ball as he recruits pals Dylan, a guitar-playing rabbit (voiced by Jimmy Fallon), Ermintrude, an opera-singing cow (Whoopi Goldberg), Train, a choo-choo train with personality (Chevy Chase) and Brian, a well-spoken snail with a crush on the cow (William H Macy).

Together this ragtag group of heroes traverse ice-capped mountains, navigate fiery pits of lava, and sail across vast oceans on the perilous journey to recover each of the three diamonds before Zeebad can.

Fortunately when things get really desperate they can call upon the good living spring wizard guy Zebedee (voiced by living legend Ian McKellen).  Oh and in case you were wondering how they fit in, Kevin Smith voices a moose with a terrible case of flatulence and Bill Hader's acting abilities are harnessed for purpose of a living British toy soldier named Sam.  Even the thankless miscellaneous voices of extras and background characters aren't generic here as The Office's John Krasinski (who plays the infectiously drab Jim Halpert) was called upon for the task.  Again how could this much talent possibly derail?

Perhaps part of the problem stems from the fact that unlike most animated feature films, which basically start life with a loosely drafted script for which the actors can play with while adlibbing, Doogal was already a completed film when the cast got started.  As a result, what actually took place in the production process was a voice-over dub job rather than an original animated feature.  There is little doubt that the restrictions of trying to keep time with the original sequences (and harder still, attempts to match mouth flaps) ate into the comedic abilities of all involved- and it shows.

Then there's the sheer oddness of it all.  Granted as Pixar and DreamWorks have proven time and time again, part of the charm of the computer animated medium is the ability to caricaturize reality but here it borders on Alice in Wonderland style wackiness.  Merry-go-rounds that serve as prisons for evil sorcerers; that are in daily use mind you, living metal springs amidst a group of talking animals, a Moose that cuts the cheese constantly yet complains that the evil wizard stinks, and a lead character that nobody can be sure whether they love or hate are a few of the examples I can recall.

If I can offset my complaints with one simple justification, it would be this: The cute visuals will likely appeal to younger children not yet mature enough to watch this type of picture for intelligent dialog or masterful pacing.  The slapstick will most certainly appeal as well.  The majority of the humor included, however, is based on the concept of rapid-fire pop culture references.  Some of these work, others are pretty corny.  The sad reality is that by the time the audience is socially aware enough to recognize the references, they'll likely also be aware enough to realize this really isn't solid story telling.

In all this is one most fans of quality computer animation should pass over.  Very young kids might enjoy the visuals and the odd British charm throughout but everyone else would be better off looking elsewhere.",1285545600,,4985,4.974698795180723
2547805,1,B000F0V0KO,"As mediocre as ""Vailant"" was, at least Disney was kind enough to keep the British flavor intact.  For some reason, this movie was dubbed in English when it was already in English in the first place.

I remember fondly of a movie called ""The TV Set"".  That movie described a writer who made a TV pilot for a big network studio; it was a tragic drama much to his vision, but the network executives had drastically changed his vision over the course of test screenings and vague marketing profiles.  In the end, the tragic drama became an overly-commercialized, off-beat romantic-comedy where the cancerous sibling from the writer's original vision was now a prison inmate who made a fart when he arrived.  That's exactly the sodomized, mangled treatment that ""Doogal"" has: from the cast, the story, to even the animal creature that farts when it moves.

Did I see ""The Magic Roundabout"", the original UK version?  Nope, so I can't judge it by its own merits, but it's obvious to how different the US version is just by eyes and ears only.  The Weinstein Company hired comedian actors to redub many characters, and these actors made sure that their characters has to make as much one-liners about existing shows and movies as possible.  I am serious, the entire dub script is just them making pop-culture references, and the problem with such a treatment is that they're poorly-implemented.  Lousy lip-synching is an obvious flaw to this version, but the actors make references that don't even connect to the mood and action of their characters; one example has the jack rabbit making a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gollum/dp/B00005JKZV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gollum</a>&nbsp;reference while holding a diamond, but when he said 'My Precious', the character doesn't physically imitate Gollum, he just said it.  Heck, the good guys faced a skeleton crew where every line they said is related to ""Pirates of the Carribean"", even the movie title itself.  Sometimes, the verbal references don't even make sense, like when they're on a train sequence, and a slug mentioned&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mini-Me/dp/B00001U0BN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mini-Me</a>&nbsp;when he saw the bad-guy chasing them in a drill; what does the bad guy on the train have anything to do with Verne Troyer?  The only characters that don't seem to spout one-liners are the few voiced by the original British actors.  It makes you wonder, don't it?

I hated the main character, Doogal.  He's selfish, destroys things, and only brings inconvenience to his fellow team of farm animals on a quest to save the world; I don't know if that's how he really is originally, but just looking at him gets on my nerves.  The whole story is insulting, just by how the premiseis : Doogal mistakenly reawakened the big bad spring toy, Zeebad, who then freezes everything, including his friends who are stuck inside a frozen carousel, so he and his friends get help by a wizard.  Y'know, the gang could've just grab a bark, make a fire from it and use it to melt the ice to rescue their friends.  Even if they couldn't with their bare paws, they have a wizard who can burn things with his hands...AND THEY DON'T USE HIM TO GET THEIR FRIENDS OUT FOR SAFETY!  And they got a deux ex machine pocketbox which they hardly use.  I hoped the UK version explained these obvious plot holes, because it was so dumbed down, which didn't help by the actors spouting puns.

This is probably the worst animated localization I've ever seen since ""Digimon: The Movie"".  The US version of ""Doogal"" made what's apparently a par cartoon movie, into one of the worst animated films I've seen; even worse than ""Shark Tale"".  Not recommended for even the most adoring of dog lovers.",1279411200,2,3813,5.1227786752827145

First of all, why would anyone take something that is based on a show that holds great affection in one country and then try to sell it another where it has no relevance at all? I bought the British version from England because of my interest in Robbie Williams, and I have to say it was okay. Being American, I didn't have any childhood memories of this show to make me really interested, but the humour was definitely British and Robbie Williams was good as were the other voice talents (all actors I have seen before), but the American version...what a travesty? There is a simple charm to the British version, we Americans can't do charm.

Upon subsequent viewing, the real..joy of the movie, the fun and spirit of it really set in.  It's a well made, little kid movie.  It's perfect for 2-4 year olds, emphasizing the strength of relationships and...love.  Pure, unadulterated, friend-love.

Most children's TV series today don't appeal to adults either (with some notable exceptions like Kipper and Pocoyo).  It's not a classic must have and do keep in mind it was based on a old TV series and like most movies based on TV series it's something that probably could have been done in 1/2 hour show and kept the kids happy.  That being said I think anyone giving it 1 star (or less) is a bit off base for what the film was really intended.  Not something I'd have paid money to see in the cinema at full price but wouldn't stop me from buying a copy for the house.

So much so, that the plot doesn't even make sense at first. But this movie is based on a series of popular books and a resulting television series in the UK, so it's assumed the viewer already knows all about it. So the movie doesn't stand on your own... unless you're THREE. If you have a 3 year old boy who likes innocent things like Thomas the Tank Engine, this movie is for you. The most evil thing that happens is a Jon Stewart-voiced villain shoots ice out of his moustache. My son has watched this thing so many times, he's now voicing the dialogue with the actors. It's embarrassing, but it's one of our most-viewed videos in the collection, so I have to recommend it - if you have kids of course.",1219017600,,844,4.416666666666667
2547814,1,B000F0V0KO,"If I could give this movie less than 1 star, I would.

I saw this movie a few summers ago as part of a free summer screening series at a local theater.  I thought it would be fun to take my two youngsters out to a wholesome G-rated movie...I'm STILL regretting the time spent there that I'll never get back.

I could not remember the name of this film and spent the last 20 minutes searching for it just so I could warn others to turn away...don't look directly at it!  I am not a vindictive person and don't enjoy tearing apart the work of others.  However, it is beyond me how so many talented, well-known actors found themselves doing the voices for this movie.  Did they not read the script?  I really wonder how far they got into making this movie before they realized - WITH HORROR - that they were contractually obligated to see it through to the end.  A week?  A day?

There is soooo much wrong with this movie and I don't remember the plot (even though I just read the synopsis of the film!)  Perhaps it is because there IS NO PLOT.  It is just one bad moment after another and the one part about it that I do remember involves the characters coming into a town.  No one seems to be bothered by or even notice the absence of any other living thing in this otherwise cheery town.  There is an amusement park or carousel or something like that in the center of town - no one running it and no inhabitants - yet there it is.

It's awful.  And just to be clear, it's not the kind of awful that is so bad that it's good in a different way.  No.  This is a time waster with absolutely NOTHING redeeming about it.  I saw it for FREE and still remember it as the worst movie I've ever seen.  I can't imagine how I'd feel if I paid any money to see it.

Yes, the dog looking creature thing in the photo looks cute.  That's what hooked me into seeing it.  But there is a reason why you only see part of this creature called ""Doogal.""  The rest of its head and body are just as incompletely visualized and realized as the rest of the movie.  I don't know if it's a dog or a bear or an old skein of yarn and neither did my children who are pretty forgiving and easy going about these sorts of things.

The problem, I think, with those who give this movie a poor rating are that they are basing it off of animations which are essentially aimed at older children and teenagers. If you are basing your recomendation off of Seseme Street, Dora the Explorer, Blues Clues and Mr. Rogers, Doogal ranks quite high in intellect, method and style. Compare it to the Care Bears, Smurfs or Strawberry Shortcake of my toddler years, and Doogal makes leaps toward Shakespeare.

It's adorable stop-motionesqe style and series of easily understood and realistically flawed characters is beneficial to a developing child's sense of normality. With enough action to grab attention and an easily understandable plot, Doogal has the ability to keep a child entertained, and teach them about social dynamics: forgivness, redemption, hope and deterimation are all touted without undue preachyness.

In addition, there are enough references and adult jokes to keep a parent entertained. (Lord of the Rings, Matrix, and Harry Potter, for example.)I very much doubt it was very enjoyable to watch as an older person alone. However, through the medium of a young child's vision, Doogal takes on truely a fantastic and enjoyable golden glow. All of this with the benefits of an all-star, very talented voice cast. As the mother of a young girl, I cannot recomend this movie highly enough.

I highly recomend this DVD for anyone who's watched a hundred hours of any given video. When my daughter insists, Again, on watching Doogal, I can be reasonably assured she will remain involved; and I, around my book, or in between my bouts of housekeeping, or over my sewing, am frequently smileing and laughing myself.

2547831,1,B000F0V0KO,"The Enchanted Village is a happy place ruled by the good-natured wizard Zebedee (Ian McKellen) where young Florence (Kylie Minogue) and her dog, Doogal (Daniel Tay), come to play with their friends, including opera-singing cow Ermintrude (Whoopi Goldberg), beatnik rabbit Dylan (Jimmy Fallon), and Brian the Snail (William H. Macy). However, life in the Enchanted Village takes a turn for the worse when Zebedee's evil brother, Zeebad (Jon Stewart), arrives, freezing the town under a layer of ice and bringing the magic merry-go-round to a halt. Zeebad is searching for three magical jewels that will give him the power to freeze the whole world and rule the Earth, but Zebedee is able to thaw out himself, Florence, and her friends, and they join forces aboard the Magic Train (Chevy Chase) in a bid to stop the villain before it's too late.

The Weinstein Company is sure busy this year so far. Last month, they released ""Hoodwinked"", another ""Shrek""-type movie that coasted on pop culture references and an all-star cast. It was an admirable effort, and cleaned house at the box office, but audiences nitpicked over the shoddy animation and stale parodies of ""Star Wars"" and ""The Matrix"". Now, there's yet another movie following in the footsteps of ""Hoodwinked"", ""Doogal"". Guess what? This new movie is actually worse.

Maybe the Weisteins should've executive produced?

""Doogal"" starts off with a confident note. When Jimmy Fallon and Whoopi Goldberg started belting out ""You Really Got Me"", I couldn't help but join along with them. That and there was sure to be proof that this effort would coast on this type of charm.

Well, my fears were realized when the movie's plot came into play. At this point, countless references are made: Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, ""CSI"", ""Indiana Jones"", John Woo, ""Looney Tunes"", ""The Lord of the Rings"" (the movie's background spoof), ""The Matrix"" (alright, that has past its prime), MC Hammer, Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"", ""Pimp My Ride"", ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", ""The Shining"", ""Soul Train"", and the Wu-Tang Clan among other things. It seems that writers are so enamored with throwing them all over the place, they forgot character development. This also hampers the chances of this movie to be taken seriously.

And, for a G-rated movie, there's a lot of scary stuff the children will be scared of - like a gaping wound coming from a toy soldier. Or even having excessively realistic skeletons with scary glowing eyes imperiling the cuddly heroes. Oh, and did we mention a lot of fart gags (not even the normally funny Kevin Smith can lift this type of material above ground).

Another thing is that this movie was not screened for critics. So you know that this movie is bad. But what would attract a huge number of celebrities to a movie of this caliber. A mishmash of SNL cast members (Jimmy Fallon, Bill Hader, and Chevy Chase), Academy Award winners (William H Macy and Whoopi Goldberg), talented British actors (Dame Judi Dench, Sir Ian McKellan, and Kylie Minogue), Kevin Smith, and John Stewart, not one of these well-known stars are able to make one gag or scene come off the right way.

Speaking of that, Daniel Tay is not the best child actor out there. No matter how hard he tries, Tay cannot be able to give life to Doogal when a certain scene is called upon to be funny or - most importantly - sentimental. This makes Doogal a flat-out bore, and he's supposed to be the protagonist.

O may have to reconsider my review on ""Hoodwinked"". Because at least the aforementioned movie tried to make its pop culture references work. ""Doogal"" doesn't seem interested in letting the potential come out of its shell, making it a laughless animated feature. What's shocking is at the end of this movie, we saw clips of the voice actors have a lot of fun, including Jimmy Fallon and Jon Stewart. Too bad the movie doesn't coast on that gimmick.",1164412800,3,3887,4.878787878787879

2547833,2,B000F0V0KO,"When told that Doogle features an evil villain voiced by Jon Stewart who shoots icicles out of his mustache, I couldn't refuse. Turns out Stewart isn't the only celeb star in this bizarre little children's legend--we also have Whoopi Goldberg, Chevy Chase, Jimmy Fallon, and Kylie Minogue giving life these cute yet not-so-gripping 3D animations.

It's a typical good vs. evil, save the world tale.  When evil wizard Zeebad (who bounces along spring-bound) is released from his trap inside a carousal, havoc is unleashed in a world where people, dogs, rabbits, and toys logically interact. The best friend of our protagonist, Doogle the dog, is trapped inside the frozen carousel, and Doogle and his team of friends must recover and replace three magical diamonds in order to make the world normal again.

The lines are painfully cheesy, even for children, and laced with tons of pop-cultural references that will shoot straight over the head of the film's target audience (The Apprentice, Lord of the Rings, Pink Floyd, Art Garfunkel, Soul Train). Fart jokes are plentiful. While this will appeal to kids, it won't be particularly absorbing or memorable. Adults may be amused if under an influence.",1156118400,,1199,5.107142857142857

As for the fart jokes, are you serious sometimes the funnest thing in the world is when someone farts in a silent room. I mean come on, with as many fart jokes they circulate on Nickelodeon I would say the movie is just giving kids what they want. The only reason I took one star away from this movie is the one thing no one else commented on THE MAGIC it seemed to me the movie would have been just as good with out every little thing being done with magic I mean really two girls, a boy, there ""Grandfather"", a farm full of talking animals, and a man/spring cant put a picnic together without a magic mustache?

The script is awful.  I also find that freaking bunny rabbit (Jimmy Fallon) to be one of the most annoying characters I have ever watched.  And I like Jimmy Fallon.

2547849,3,B000F0V0KO,"The Magic Roundabout is a British television series adapted into a movie.  There are three versions for the UK, France and the USA, and this one is the US version. I've seen both the UK and the US versions, and the US version is the better of the two, largely due to the narration of Dame Judi Dench which is not in my copy of the UK version.  The UK version also uses different actors for some of the characters. (Most notably Robbie Williams and Bill Nighy)

The story is very simple, back to the old basics of good versus evil.  Shaggy dog Doogal (Daniel Tay) accidentally releases bad wizard ZeeBad (Jon Stewart) from his prison inside the Magic Roundabout, causing a chain reaction that traps his owner Florence (Kylie Minogue) and her friends inside the iced over roundabout.  Doogal and his friends call on good wizard Zebedee (Sir Ian McKellen), who sends them on a quest to recover three magical diamonds and replace them in the roundabout.  If however ZeeBad gets his hands on the diamonds he will have the power to freeze the sun triggering an eternal ice age.

The intrepid adventurers are Doogal, Ermintrude the opera singing cow (Whoopi Goldberg), Brian the brave snail who's in love with Ermintrude (William H. Macy), Dylan the tripped out rabbit (Jimmy Fallon) and Train the train with tunnel vision (Chevy Chase). ZeeBad enlists Soldier Sam (Bill Hader) formerly of the roundabout to be his accomplice, and along the way they meet a helpful but flatulent Moose (Kevin Smith).

With this kind of star power Doogal should have been a great movie, but somewhere along the way it changed from a children's story to an action movie spoof, thereby effectively losing both intended audiences.  It has a few laughs, some catchy music and you'll have fun picking out the pop culture and movie references, but that's about it.  Rent it for the star power, but don't expect too much.

Sometimes it feels like it's just being packed on just because there's room enough to pack more on.  But really, the graphics are amazing; the story is enjoyable; and many of the characters are just loveable.

It's the main character that screws up the whole story.  (I liked Jar-Jar Binks.)  This guy is so bad.  Not only is the character in and of itself the most annoying character ever screened, but the voice actor seems to have read: every, single, line, off, a, queue, card.  There's no emotion, intensity, or variation in any part of his performance.  He could define m-o-n-o-t-o-n-e.

Other more minor complaints are many elements of the plot seem to have been placed in there just because the direct thought everybody else would do it, so he should also.  It feels flat when you get through it.  It's bad.",1151280000,5,980,4.574712643678161

The dialogue was absolutely horrible, so bad that I was looking for a French audio track on the DVD so I wouldn't have to listen to it (which is strangely missing seeing that this is based on the French animation ""Le Manege Enchante"").
