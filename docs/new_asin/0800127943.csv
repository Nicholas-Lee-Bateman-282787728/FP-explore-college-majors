167725,5,0800127943,"This show has stayed with me since I first saw it years ago. It was the first show that made me care about anything scientific, with the exception of anything that blows up. It has been a decade, and I still have the urge to break out a box, stick a hole in it, then watch tv backwards and upside down. Beakman, the guy in a rat suit, and all envolved started an interest in science that has never left me. I learned inertia from Beakman two years before my early classmates. He has a flashy personna that grabs the attention of youngsters and adults alike. Buy Beakman's World, especially if you homeschool, or think your child is having trouble in this area. It's hard to find educational material that is so much fun.",1094601600,3,720,4.380597014925373

167782,5,0800127943,"""Beakman's world"" is ""Sesame Street"" meets your grade-school science class meets ""Chuck E. Cheese"" (now ""Charles E. Cheese"", lmao), on a slight dose of Red Bull and Vodka (a girl's drink). ""Beakman's world"" is what this real world needs, since most teenagers/kids these days are busy on social media websites and tweeting useless information instead of learning about science (i.e. biology, chemistry, physics) which is useful to learn about. If you're smart and interested in learning about science (sans the boring, mundane, and drab teacher/professor with absolutely no sense of humor), then watch ""Beakman's world"" and enlighten this world and leave this world a better place for your children.",1395532800,2,698,5.412844036697248

167784,5,0800127943,"I truly believe this is one of the best shows ever produced for kids.  Has there ever been a program that made science and education more fun than this?  I can't imagine there has been.  Beakman is a not-so-mad scientist, who teaches scientific principles and facts, with fun, wit, and charm.  His ""lab rat"" Lester and assistant Josie (Alana Ubach, who since has made a career for herself in numerous roles) add to the fun.  I enjoyed this as a teen, and now my kids have an absolute blast learning about science with Beakman.  These episodes really hold up, and are just as good as they were 20 years ago  - they don't look that dated at all.  Paul Zaloom is fantastic as Beakman, and again, why this show never found a huge audience is a mystery to me.  Recommend - you won't regret this purchase.",1389744000,3,799,4.417808219178082

This item is just a small extract from the best episodes from the show, even though it is a mandatory collectors pick. Now other young kids in my family are having amusement with this still fresh show. So my question now is: why all the seasons are not available??",1387324800,4,633,4.51304347826087

167799,5,0800127943,"Beakman's World is the most entertaining way to learn science!  He and his cast of characters (Josie and Lester) provide the most interesting way to understand many different principles of science.  Most of the lessons teach you how to do it yourself ...most beneficial for those people who need to learn in a ""hands-on"" environment.
  It is so entertaining that I often find myself watching it again, and again, because I missed some of the jokes the first or second time that I watched it.  Bill Nye is too dry, and his explanations, although correct and accurate, can be hard to follow or keep my interest.  Beakman has a blend of both good science articulation, as well as, humorous entertainment that gets me through the boring detail.  I actually WANT to learn.",1286150400,2,767,4.765151515151516
167800,5,0800127943,"Beakman's World is a fast paced crowd pleaser if a science video.  It is pretty rapid fire, so it doesn't necessarily camp on a specific subject if your looking for a Bill Nye type video, but it is highly entertaining, with tons of experiments you can do on your own with either a classroom or at home.  My class this year loved Beakman more than Bill Nye.  I just wish there were more Beakman videos out there.  But, a great video and wildly entertaining.",1279411200,,456,4.392857142857143

167831,4,0800127943,"My husband and I used to love watching Beakman's world on Saturday mornings (as well as Parker Lewis Can't Lose), so this show obviously has a broad base.  It is irreverant, and shows a more ""urban"" feel than Bill Nye The Science Guy but they are both cut from the same cloth.  Quick cut edits, weird sound effects, snappy dialog, fun science.  Toddlers wouldn't like or appreciate this or Bill Nye, but my kids (9.5, 8 and 5) all love both, and after watching this DVD, immediately ran outside to try out some of the experiments he showed them.  Gotta love that!  It is slightly dated (I think they talk about records or cassette tapes in the start of the DVD), but the science still holds, and there's nothing quite like Beakman and his friends!",1256947200,,747,4.503703703703704
167832,4,0800127943,"[5 stars for the program, 4 for the DVD, sight unseen, because they tell me there isn't enough Josie]

I wasn't going to review this item, as I felt there was no need. I only came here to buy this item for my age 6 son, and scanned the reviews in hope that one might contain information on which episodes/excerpts were included in this video.
But I stumbled on a review that was just WRONG, and saw that others had marked it as helpful, and then thought of the children who would be deprived of this opportunity to learn AND have fun which is NOT AVAILABLE ANYWHERE ELSE. I COULD NOT leave this alone. While I replied to the review, THIS WAS NOT ENOUGH.
A shortened version of my reply:
[that other review]""...two puppet penguins...when one stated that he was ""younger and sexier"" than the other, I began to worry."" And it goes on.

Whoever put this DVD together obviously made a major error, in that this joke was now made out-of-context in editing. Bearing no real sexual content whatsoever, it's a biological/genetics joke: said penguins are *twins*. As such, any reference to difference in age or physical appeal is essentially moot. Therein lies the joke.
My sister was 3 when she heard this joke, and she got it immediately. She recently credited this show with getting A's in COLLEGE science classes, having had no real immersion in science in between. My grandmother, wife of a minister, and mother of 3 others, was also tickled pink when she heard this joke.
These penguins typically represented ""what-not-to-do"", much like ""Mr. Lundt"" from Veggie Tales, and all viewers come away with the impression to avoid their behavior and actions, now and always.

""""Beakman"" was obnoxious...""  ...[blink, blink].... I truly believe that anyone who reads this line should go look up that word. ""Oscar the Grouch"" and countless other children's characters ARE obnoxious, even sometimes when they're put forth as ""the good guy"". Nye is obnoxious as often as not. ""Beakman"" more than anything else was ""put-upon"", trying to teach both the viewers and the other characters fun things about science, but fighting an uphill battle all the way.

The ""talking hands"" are used on purpose to direct the eye and to capture and keep the attention of viewers under age 10. Dozens of studies show that this also helps children retain what they've just heard--often for the rest of their lives. It's especially helpful for children *and adults* with everything from A.D.D. to dyslexia to focal seizures. It's how many oral-tradition cultures kept their histories alive and INTACT for milennia.

The ""tattooed mouse"" is a favorite of other reviewers, and made the top 20 in favorite children's characters numerous times and in widely varied places. The actress who portrays the much-missed Josie (who made the top TEN above) continues to give award-winning performances in vastly differing genres, such as being singled out for excellence in both good and bad reviews of The Brady Bunch Movie.

Millions worldwide agree that: the original Sesame Street was the best overall childrens' educational show ever
the Letter People was the best preschool childrens' educational show for learning to read, ever
the Electric Company was the best age 6+ childrens' educational show, for learning to read and for gaining command of English, ever
Math Net was the best childrens' educational show, for learning the basics and cultivating interest in math, ever
THIS SHOW was the best childrens' educational show, for learning the basics and cultivating interest in science, ever

I loathe half the children's programs currently running. My family and I have only agreed on 7 things EVER; this show was one of them. If I could afford it, I would buy a few hundred copies of this DVD to give to all I know with children and to local schools and children's centers and more. Naturally I second the motion made by reviewer ""Dakota"" (and others) to press the issue and get the entire series out on DVD.

I was in my teens and had been in advanced science classes from 1st grade on, and still found this program to be helpful, informative, and entertaining enough to write all that I have here (and could easily add more) and to seek out this program for my son.

Regardless of where you purchase ""Beakman"" DVD's or how much you pay for them, GET THEM if you have children of any age at home.",1240358400,9,4357,4.828418230563003

Grown-ups and kids a like will learn something while laughing at the ridiculous puns and jokes. He teaches kids about balance points and the center of gravity in one section. He shows them how to balance 2 forks on the end of a tooth pick. He recommends using a salt shaker to hold it up. We were in a chinese resturant and the salt shaker didn't have a flat head so after we paid the bill we balanced the 2 forks on the hole in the top of the metal tea kettle and left it for the waiter to see.

I thought it was so funny and made science interesting and fun.  I learned a lot of ""tricks"" or rather cool experiments, in particular how to balance two forks on a toothpick!  The only thing that is wrong with the DVD is Josie isn't on it enough.  She was one of my favorite characters and I guess since this DVD isn't complete episodes, the scenes she appears in weren't included as much.  Also, the only other bad thing is, it isn't long enough!  Only 60 minutes!  I am certainly grateful as it has been many years since I have seen the show on TV.  But really, it is just a teaser.  They need to put the entire series on DVD!

At any rate, it is a good starter for anyone who has not seen the show, or who hasn't seen it in a long time and remembers it!  I would definitely recommend it for kids and adults, whether they like science or not.  I never really liked science, but this show just made it so fun!  The show is very cleverly written and the acting is great.  It was obviously made by talented and intelligent people with a sense of humor, sometimes weird, but always funny!  What more can I say?

167869,5,0800127943,"This long awaited DVD is good ... very good .. but it could be better. This is nothing more than the video previously released on VHS. If fact Beakman refers numerous times to ""this tape"" or ""halfway thru the tape"" during the video.

AND the previews of other videos are all OLD movies.

BUT, at least we have Beakman on DVD. Only an hour, but what an hour it is.  Beakman along with lab rat Lester, and sidekick Jose do numerous scientific experiments. Explaning how to do them (safely) and why things do what they do. Each experiment is a ""chapter"" so you can go to a specific experiment easily.

I'm dissapointed that this was not a new collection made just for DVD. AND .. I suspect that, while it is also available in your local video store, it will not sell very well ... WHY? .. because it will be hard to find unless you are specifially looking for it .. and even then you may need to ask an employee (of course you can buy it here on AMAZON instead)

What I'm REALLY waiting for is complete seasons .. but if they are ""testing the waters"" with this DVD and it doesn't sell well, they will likely not release anything further :-(

SUGGESTION: It's cheap enough .. why not buy an extra copy and donate it to your local public library?
