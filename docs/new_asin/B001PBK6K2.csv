3746910,5,B001PBK6K2,"First off let me say the bonus performance was worth the DVD alone. Absolutely wonderful. I wish she had included the choreography to it. Sadie is not the belly dancer to be played with she knows her stuff and she wants you to know it as well.

Sadie is a very technical teacher as well. She is teaching you the mechanics of what you are doing, she even shows what you should not be doing. Go figure she herself is a very technical dancer. She really breaks down the movement and you can see everything she is doing. There are no weird camera angles.

The Menu is broken down in an easy way to get what you want, no need to go through the whole DVD to get to one section. The choreography is a  three part short choreography but you do use a lot of what you learned. She even uses a variety of arm and hand placement. Even the little that she uses is a step up. I have a couple of her DVD's and she is not a fan of hand and arm movements.

I recommend this DVD for everyone, even advanced students need to constantly drill the basic. The content is outstanding. This is a very thorough technique DVD. Some of her concepts are nice. Like when she did the upper body movement in something like a sumu squat. Her constant reminders about posture throughout the DVD is wonderful. The about me section is just a brief written review about her. The first reviewer pretty much covered everything,there really isn't to much to say but this DVD is worth the money.

To me the magic in this DVD comes from drilling the basics with correct posture. That is when you start to see the Sadie style execution and it can be something that is easily overlooked. Are your knee's bent the entire time? Does your pelvic stay tucked under for all the movements? Sadie stays bent knees for the majority of her movements ,and her pelvic always stays tucked unless doing an interior hip circle. It takes work to transition through movements staying in the correct posture. If you like Sadie style and plan on using her more advanced DVD'S or if you have her more advanced DVD's but struggle. This would be the perfect DVD to get. Doing this DVD with awareness will really take you along way.

With that said I usually skip her arms section and drill that with another DVD. Her shimmy section can be troublesome. The shimmy that she does on here looks more like a freeze shimmy as opposed to the bent knee shimmy or the Egyptian shimmy. Not a problem but you may not be drilling the shimmy you want to drill.",1237593600,63,2483,4.352051835853132
3746911,5,B001PBK6K2,"This dvd is perfect in everyway.  Sadie is one of the best bellydancers in the world.  You now have the option to learn bellydance or at least clean up your skills and perfect them, with Sadie.  Sadie is generous in this dvd, giving many of the bellydance ""secrets"" to you.  Before you would have to buy many dvds and pick from here and there to fill in your bellydance knowledge, but now with this dvd by Sadie, you don't have to do that because it is all there.  Sadie is amazingly beautiful and very friendly.  I recommend this highly.  I am going to use it to perfect my technique or as a drilling practice dvd.  Much love and peace to you, Sadie and the world! Amen. And so it is!",1236988800,10,685,4.2153846153846155

bonus performance: ah ya Zein

You can go to each one seperately and drill the area you need the most work in.
Very well put together. Nice astmosphere. Music fits the moves that she is teaching. The warm up is a drill of basic moves with no muscle isolations. It is a nice length in itself. The whole Dvd is a lot of drilling. For instance I counted how many times she did the figure's 8's(56 counts that is left right= 1 count) that was slow, then she speeds it up another 50 plus counts then she slow is down again for maybe another 30. each technigue is drilled.

the shimmy's for any one who has not mastered it here is your chance. she starts off with slow hip movements 60 left 1,right 2 counts she speeds it up a knotch maybe 1-2 more times and each level of speed you are doing the move for about 30-50 counts before she gets to the fast shimmy which she keeps you there for a nice while holding the tempo. by the time you get to the actual shimmy you may be hipped out. I got it now and can hold it.

The egyption variations are traveling moves she calls arabic 1,2,and 3.  You do undulations, shimmy;s and other traveling moves on rela've as well. There is one move she did that had my hip burning and I was glad she switched to the other side.

The undulations variations is going from a upper undualtion to a lower undulation in one move. I looked at but have not practiced the traveling hip circles combinations and layering variations yet.

 She mentions that many of the moves are not basic moves but she figure now is a good time to learn them. She makes you want to master the technigues. She makes you maintain proper form throughout the dvd. She mentioned also that she designed this dvd to equal an eight week course.

She expresses that it is very important to practice as much as you can to train your muscle memory and it is important to stregnthen the muscles. It is a lot on this dvd and for the price you can't beat it at all. I would have paid more for it. I actually paid more than you will if you get it from amazon. If you are looking for a good dvd to get you started and want to learn muscle isolation like Sadie you are in for a treat.

I don't give too many reviews but many has helped me not waist my money espcially the one's who do the video clips. I also would like to mention that rather or not something is beginner's or not depends on the person. If you have a dance background like salsa, african and can do the moves in dirty dancing or have taken folk dancing and line dancing many of the same moves are implicated just maybe done slightly different. the two step and three step and the grape vine I learned in a gym class under folk dancing along with other variations that I do not see but plan to use in my own dance style. You will catch on to the moves very easy if you have a dance back ground even if you have never belly danced because you have some dicipline alreay. If you work out doing yoga or pilates muscle isoalations will be easier because you have alrealy learned to control your internal muscles. Your dance style also makes a differnce. if you are a stiff person vs a flexable person who you learn from may make a difference. There are some dvd's that had a lot of good stuff in them but they moved too slow for I got bored. I like it when you keep moving. If you start talking a lot with no movement I will loose interest and never get through the dvd. Hope this helps.",1235174400,192,3924,4.385144429160936

3746949,5,B001PBK6K2,"I was worried that Sadie's instruction would be too difficult for a beginner, but she goes at a slow pace demonstrating moves and going over them several times before moving on. Her dancing is supreme and sensuous, and even though as a beginner I would recommend Jillina's ""Shape Up and Hips Out,"" for drilling on technique and exercise, this one is very good and well done. This time Sadie is using a mirror. I still get confused. Sadie's DVD Sultry Slow moves covers completely different material so the two are compatible. Still Jillina's routine will have beginners dancing like pros in no time-combining arm movements and walking to hip and chest moves simultaneously.",1413590400,2,673,4.964601769911504

3746956,5,B001PBK6K2,"I have been belly dancing for two months now. I have tried two other beginner belly dance DVDs (Amira's Belly Dance 101 and Belly Dance for Beginners with Leila of Cairo.) Out of the three, I think this one is the best and I have definitely gotten the most from it. I won't spend time breaking down the DVD because it has already been done so extensively by other reviewers. For me, this DVD has been useful in drilling a lot of the basic moves. The warm-up is pretty long and thorough. The overall set-up of the DVD is very organized and well-planned out. The breakdown of each individual move is precise, with plenty of tips, tricks, and friendly reminders. Sadie, as an instructor, is straightforward and down to business. She doesn't waste time by pausing and talking like other instructors; she is able to move and talk at the same time, keeping you actively engaged.

I have now just reached a point where I can work through this DVD in its entirety; not only is it long, but it will make you work. I have lost weight by working with this DVD, and I've noticed a considerable difference in my legs, thighs, arms, shoulders, and abdomen. Personally, I think this video is better suited for people who are serious about leaning how to belly dance. There is a lot of drilling, which might not be appealing to someone who is looking for a fun, upbeat dance workout. I will definitely continue to work with this DVD in the future, but I might limit my usage of it to once a week or when I feel like I need to refresh/drill the basics.",1404518400,15,1535,4.424028268551237
3746957,4,B001PBK6K2,"WHAT IS BETTER THAN IN OTHER DVD's:
+ Intense drilling of most basic bellydance moves (a lot of repetitions for each move), together with Sadie giving you constant advise on posture and muscle engagement, all to nice instrumental oriental music
+ Excellent for beginners (not absolute beginners though), to really get the movements into your muscle memory
+ Best explanation and practise I have seen of the hip-drop on the down
+ Good coverage of travel steps (Arabic 1, 2 and 3, as well as basic Egyptian). I had not seen all of them in any of my other BD DVD's, although Jenna covers most of them, without naming them specifically.

It's a pity I did not buy this earlier in my ""introduction"" to bellydance, since this DVD is excellent for drilling basic bellydance moves. Maybe I will still use it sometimes to really get the moves into my muscle memory and to master the hip drop on the down and all the Arabic walks and turns; in fact, it does not matter which level you are, you can never have enough drilling of the basic moves. If you would like to drill a bit more advanced material I recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Modern-Tribal-Belly-Dance-with-Asharah-Beginner-tribal-fusion-bellydance-how-to-Belly-dancing-instruction/dp/B000UZRT4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Modern Tribal Belly Dance, with Asharah: Beginner tribal fusion bellydance how-to, Belly dancing instruction</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Contemporary-Belly-Dance-and-Yoga-with-Ariellah-Tribal-fusion-bellydance-classes-Belly-dance-fitness-workout-and-yoga-instruction-Beginner-intermediate/dp/B000KZRP12/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Contemporary Belly Dance and Yoga, with Ariellah: Tribal fusion bellydance classes, Belly dance fitness, workout, and yoga instruction, Beginner-intermediate</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Serpentine-Bellydance-with-Rachel-Brice-TWO-DVD-SET-Complete-belly-dancing-instructional-program-Belly-dancing-classes-with-yoga-How-to-in-Rachel-s-tribal-style-belly-dance-including-full-choreographies/dp/B00095NX9G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Serpentine: Bellydance with Rachel Brice (TWO-DVD SET): Complete belly dancing instructional program, Belly dancing classes with yoga, How-to in Rachel's tribal style belly dance, including full choreographies</a>&nbsp;(best shimmy layering section in my collection) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bellydance-Pop-Lock-Tribal-Fusion-Hip-Hop-with-Elisheva-Belly-dancing-classes-Tribal-fusion-belly-dance-instruction-Hip-hop-belly-dance-fusion-how-to/dp/B001LKK6WA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bellydance Pop & Lock - Tribal Fusion Hip-Hop with Elisheva: Belly dancing classes, Tribal fusion belly dance instruction, Hip-hop belly dance fusion how-to</a>, which drills a lot of layered movements (maybe as good as Rachel's in terms of shimmy layering).

Personally I think Asharah's drills (and her tough conditioning section) helped me improve very fast and when I used this DVD, it seemed fairly easy with some exceptions; but I had a tough time with Asharah. Maybe it's better to start with something easier but still very intense in terms of time dedicated to each drill like this one and then move up. Asharah increases the tempo more and makes more ""punctuated"" and sharp moves. If I could only get one drilling DVD, I would probably get Asharah's (because you get more fitness benefits and muscle control from it, and my main goal when I started BD and other dance DVDs was to get some exercise but in a fun way), but it really depends on your goals and on which level you already are. If you are starting bellydance, then this DVD will definitely help you drill and get the moves. On the other hand, if your goal is ethereal beauty and artistry you might get more out of Ariellah's DVD. The styles are also different, Ariellah and Asharah are gothic (or at least something like modern industrial) while Sadie is more oriental style.

In this DVD I missed Sadie's tummy rolls (she only mentions them, but does not include them in the drills), pops and accents, as well as layering, so although it says ""Complete Bellydance Guide"", it's more a ""Complete Basic Bellydance Drills DVD"". I was expecting more ""flashy"" combinations in the choreography so I was a bit dissapointed. I think I need to get one of Sadie & Kaya's DVD's or one of Sadie's Drum solos to get something of her signature style. So although this is one of the best drilling DVD's I have seen in terms of variety of basic moves and variations to those moves, as well as in terms of length dedicated to drill each move, I don't really ""love"" the DVD.

CARDIO CHALLENGE: Low TONING: Medium CHOREOGRAPHY DIFFICULTY: Beginner DRILLS: Very good for beginners; easy in terms of layering INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY: Excellent MUSIC: Very good FUN FACTOR: Medium - It's drilling, so it's not really for fun, but it is not boring either, because of the very good music.

CONTENT:
1) Warm-up. It is very lengthy and it's drilling from the start. In fact it consists mainly of bellydance isolation drills (except for a very few stretches at the beginning) and it is even divided into sections like ""upper body isolations"" and ""hip isolations"". It is hard to distinguish between the warm up and the technique sections even in the menu. The difference is that in the warm up you just repeat the isolations to get the muscles that are going to be used warmed-up, without caring too much about technique, whereas in the technique sections Sadie emphasizes which muscles you need to engage and she introduces some rhythm variations and travelling.
2) Technique section. It consists of several sections where you drill extensively almost everything (basic shimmy, horizontal figure 8's, vertical figure 8's up and down, also called ""taxeem"" and ""mayas"", full body undulations and some footwork).
3) Choreography. It consists of 3 segments containing four 8-counts each. The choreography is beginner level, so it's perfectly doable with some practise (unlike many other choreos included in BD DVD's), because it has little layering, almost no accents, the arms are used mainly to frame the body and the footwork is not complicated. Maybe the most difficult moves are the arabic turns. The choreography has not really impressed me nor does it contain any signature move; it is not fun either like the practise flows included by Jenna in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Belly-Dance-Basics-Beyond-with-Jenna-Belly-Dancing-Classes-for-a-Solid-Foundation-Bellydance-how-to-belly-dance-technique/dp/B000FSL8WQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Belly Dance Basics & Beyond, with Jenna: Belly Dancing Classes for a Solid Foundation - Bellydance how-to, belly dance technique</a>. I think the choreo was aimed at getting you more practise with the moves and how to transition between them; so not really made for fun or aesthetics, but to continue the drilling but in a sequence of moves.
4) Performance

MUSIC: Excellent instrumental oriental music, but the sound of the music is a bit low compared to Sadie's voice, so you cannot really ""submerge"" into the music and hear Sadie's recommendations as a background. The main focus is Sadie's voice with a background music so if you want to enjoy the music you will have Sadie shouting at you.

3746958,5,B001PBK6K2,"Sadie's Complete Belly dance Guide is informative and precise when providing you with dancing techniques. She is one of my favorite belly dancers, and obviously an excellent teacher as well!  This will help anyone sharpen their skills on figure 8's, shimmies, bumps, arms, Egyptian etc .  I mainly purchased this instructional DVD to learn more belly moves, sharpen my skills and broaden my horizon, on raks sharki.

Note: I found it left my hips, stomach, bones and joints, feeling amazing, almost like a massage/workout.  Though every dance lesson and every DVD is an art as well as exercise, I never felt like this before when dancing!
I enjoyed her instruction, which was detail oriented, comprehendible, and at the same time both impressive and advanced dance moves. Most of us can agree Sadie is an top notch dancer!

I have mixed emotions, about her being filmed from the back into a mirror. I can see her feet in the mirror which is nice, I'm able to view her hip and back movements clearly. The mirror is distant and a bit blurry.

Sadie does everything very well and very fast, it might be frustrating at first. I would be very frustrated if this was my first belly dance DVD. The very basic moves like hip and chest slides are explained in the warm up section, and are not really explained in depth.

With this said, her DVD is exactly what it is titled, a guide, she explains the most basic & common moves and provides you with what I would consider a drill for each. After using her DVD for several nights for a couple of weeks, I am able to do these basic moves with better fluency & my shimmies are AMAZING compared to what they were.

One realizes the importance strengthening your core and being strong enough to execute the different moves after doing just a little bit of the dvd. It does go a bit fast but just stopping and hitting the back button isn't that big a deal.

Or, if you want to study Sadie's work, I highly recommend starting with Sadie's Complete B D Guide, because her other DVD's will be much easier if you have already learned the skills from this one. The quality of instruction is the best.  Sadie gives thorough explanations of many foundation movements, and then, she teaches a short choreography that isn't too big for a new student.  The warm up section covers some very basic movements, so don't skip over it.  I should mention that, though this DVD is for beginners, it is not a watered down version of belly dance. The information presented is mandatory knowledge of ALL belly dance and will take time to master.

3746986,5,B001PBK6K2,"I'm a COMPLETE. BEGINNER.

I would like to think I have some natural ability in dance (don't we all...!) but the truth is that I have zero formal training of any sort, in any dance discipline. So for me to take up bellydancing, I truly needed a beginner's guide, and Sadie has provided that. Before all of you more experienced folks run off, though, this DVD is certainly useful for bellydancers who are beyond the beginner stage. There are advanced techniques and many excellent drills. But please do read the reviews from more advanced dancers to get their take on it, if that is your level.

Back to being a newbie... The DVD is quite in depth. Sadie goes through a thorough warmup and then moves into isolations, posture, figure 8's, undulations, shimmy, traveling movements, Egyptian variations, combining traveling & other movements, and a choreography.
As a noob, I have only worked with the warmup through to the traveling movements, and watched the rest to see what's coming once I can keep up with traveling, layering, and choreography.
Sadie gives excellent instruction throughout. Her voice is clear & pleasant. I love her general demeanor - she is calm and sweet, and I imagine a joy to work with in person. She does say ""good job"" a little too frequently, but it's kind of cute.
She makes Posture and Carriage its own section, and makes it a point to note areas where you could potentially/accidentally injure yourself. I do wish that she was a little more specific about what muscles to use at what time; for some movements and isolations, I feel a little bit like I just have to ""figure it out"" by watching and by trial and error. I also have Rachel Brice's Tribal Fusion DVD, and Rachel is very good about pointing out exactly what muscles you are supposed to be using when.

I might update this review as I progress. But at this point, having practiced bellydancing for about 2 weeks, this is how I'm doing: I have better posture while practicing and in general; my abdominal muscles are noticeably stronger; I am able to achieve basic hip isolations and figure 8's; I am able to achieve some chest isolations and figure 8's but not all; I am able to do a reverse undulation but not so much the regular undulation!; but most importantly, I love every minute of it! It's fun, it's exercise, it's dance, and I feel great.

Beginners, if you're on the fence, go for it. I'm super glad I did.",1355702400,12,2406,4.6276346604215455
3746987,3,B001PBK6K2,"Sadie is my current favorite belly dancer. I think her technique is great and her dancing is lovely.  I was hoping I would gain some insight into just what makes her so good hence I bought her video which is priced a little higher than most of the ones I purchased with my order.  I was disappointed and here's why:

First of all, I don't feel that I learned much here about belly dancing that I hadn't already been able to learn FREE off the internet watching YouTube Videos (Belly Dance Boulevard).  There aren't any secret revelations from Sadie on how to improve technique or unusual insights that made it worth paying for. It is very basic instruction.  Even that would have been okay but for my next comment.

This is called a ""complete"" belly dancing guide, and it really isn't. It does not cover MANY things that once again, other instructors give out for free online (Free Belly Dance with Tiazza).  I didn't really learn much of anything new and I feel that since I do have some basic knowledge that wasn't even on here, that it is lacking in the overall content.  While I knew some of the information would cover what I already know, I expected to see much more here and to have more detailed instruction on HOW to do moves well.

Thirdly, it was actually a bit boring, and dancing, even practicing dancing should never be boring (in my opinion). This is not because Sadie is unpleasant in any way to watch or listen to. She smiles and has a nice voice and as I said, I actually like her a lot. It is just the overall set up of the video and the teaching method didn't really engage me as some others have.

A lot of the reviewers here give the impression that this is a drill and workout video. It is not and that is okay, I didn't buy it for that, but I want to set the record straight.  I did not get a physical workout from doing the moves with her, nor was it about drilling technique. She introduces a move and demonstrates it a few times so you can get the hang of it, then moves on. Then she shows you how to use them in a short routine.  That is probably the most valuable thing about the video.  You will learn some basic moves and how to combine them into a short dance.  This is a pretty normal format for belly dance instructional videos, so why is this one so disappointing?  Aside from lack of content and insights on technique as mentioned above perhaps it is because

the music was not very inspiring, which for me is a big part of the appeal of dancing.  Once I learn the routine I will try it to some different music and hopefully that will compensate for my overall disappointment with this video.

I'm not sure that I will really watch it move than a couple of times and that means it really was not a good purchase for me.  I will think twice before getting another video from Sadie, and I had planned on getting a few others by her.  She is a great dancer, but maybe video instruction is not where she shines. I didn't feel like she really gave me any insight into how to do the moves that helped me improve my technique or that I have a more COMPLETE knowledge of belly dance moves and that was my main reason for purchasing it.

Having said all that, it is not a terrible video either, especially if you don't have constant access to YouTube to watch free lessons.  If you have little or no dance background then this probably would be an okay introduction to belly dancing from one of the best dancers I've ever seen.  You will learn some basic moves and learn how Sadie combines them into a short routine. She also emphasizes using the core abdominal muscles to do your moves and to not take shortcuts and use the hips per se,although it isn't always clear exactly HOW to do that. I am hoping that by watching it a few times and doing her short routine, I will at least get a FEEL for how to move like her, but once again, it certainly wasn't TAUGHT.  Sometimes that is really the only way to pick up things anyway. They are caught, not taught.  But for all the reasons mentioned above, this video is not as effective as it could have been.

The video itself is well done as far as packaging and design. Sound quality is good.  It is just not named correctly and is misleading. I would not have purchased it otherwise.

I think it is great that dancers like Sadie can make a living doing what they love to do and are gifted to do, and I was willing to pay for some instruction. I also realize I wasn't really going to get EVERYTHING there is to know about belly dancing from one video.  However, this particular video does not even come close in my opinion to being what it claims to be.  There are many videos available for purchase on her website and I imagine you get little bits of information from each one but would have to spend a small fortune to really get a COMPLETE picture of belly dancing and it would be a disjointed way to go about doing it.  The important thing though is to give people what they pay for.  Change the title to this video and I would not have bought the video or written this kind of review. Instead of the Complete Guide, it should be a very BASIC INTRODUCTION for beginners.

I'm not sure exactly what to think-there is so little on this video that if this is really all it takes to be a complete belly dancer, then it is not as hard as I thought, but somehow I know that after watching it, the real key to being a good belly dancer (technique) as well as having a solid overall knowledge of all the main belly dance moves, are still eluding me.

I think what Sadie does best and what makes her so good is that she has her own style and her personality and sensuality shine through her dancing.  That is something we can all work on doing which is why belly dancing is so good for women.  As for technique and moves, I will have to keep digging for the COMPLETE or ultimate guide.",1353974400,8,5852,4.269021739130435
3746988,4,B001PBK6K2,I gave this video as a gift to my co-workers. The response has been very positive. This video is great because a person can go from beginner to advanced with this video.,1352419200,,169,4.3125
3746989,5,B001PBK6K2,"I am really impressed with the instruction of Sadie's DVD. I have just started bellydance classes, and this DVD makes practicing between classes possible.

I so feel the burn from the beginning sections!",1347926400,,341,4.896551724137931

3746992,5,B001PBK6K2,"Sadie other than being a very good performer is an excellent teacher and she goes thorough a dance performance displayed at the end and how to get here with breaking it down in simple segments and offering drills to prep for each segment of the dance. This is the same techniques a professional would drill and practice for a major performance.

Yes done ballet in the past - so she does a wonderful job ......the technique very classic in instruction the same if you went to any professional dance school ballet, or etc. Yes, she does go technical but that's because she is trying to simplify it for various level of dancers making belly dancing more accessible for that she deserves a triple AAA status - the best way to preserve any art form is making it accessible to the masses....despite physical level, age or level of skill.",1343433600,,832,4.621621621621622
3746993,5,B001PBK6K2,"In my years of learning the amazing art of belly dancing (and finding myself a beginner all over again every now and then) I've come across basic instructional videos of all flavors. There are some that are created with the belief that there's no point, right at the beginning, making it all hard work and no fun. And there are others are made to focus on building foundations that are totally flawless, leaving the fun up to the learner. Of course there are also those that strike a balance between the two.

So, Sadie's instructional videos tip towards the hard work category, which means they're not for someone who wants to go through the video a few times and sass up the dance floor on Saturday. This is a beginner DVD, but it's all about technique. It's also very comprehensive, going from simple hip swings all the way to traveling steps and a mini choreography It wouldn't be wrong to describe it as a whole course, taught with expertise and focus. There's not much fooling around, not too many light moments - but some people want just that. In fact, I was looking for something to refresh my basics without wasting time chatting and cheerleading and found this a good option. Because Sadie talks and explains while she's making you do the moves, so there's no need to stand around and wait for long explanations to be through, except for a section on posture.

A short warm-up of stretches kicks off the video. As is usual with belly dance basics, you then go through arms, shoulders, and upper body isolations. Sadie's cuing has always been really very good. She breaks down moves while giving you warnings and safety tips, drills them while telling you how to use your muscles and improve the move - and all the while she never loses track of the counts.

Again, as is typical, we go on to hip movements next. Sadie transitions from one to the next very smoothly even when each set of movements is n its own section, accessible from the main menu. The music is varied and quite nice, not boring you with a repeated loop or a single song. This is nice and thoughtfully done because it gets the learner accustomed to dancing to different styles of music from the start.

We go on from hip basics to undulations and variations on them with just enough repetitions to drill them without wearing out your back. And then there's an introduction to a basic shimmy. I've seen shimmy sessions I feel more comfortable with, but it'll do.
Graduating to traveling steps, we combine hip movements and footwork in more drills - with warnings about not hyper-extending knees. We spend a long while on forward and back stepping with hip hits and hip downs - a tough move by any standards. There are some Egyptian variations on these moves in another section. And finally a bunch of turns, traveling circles steps, with layering.

 Learning how to learn choreography is a skill in itself, so I's a good thing we have a chunk of choreo to work with here. It's in three parts or three combos and it isn't enough to span a song, but you do put into action what you learnt in the technique sections and the combinations are something easily usable elsewhere in future.

 This a video that I believe is really packed with content and really gives you value for money. There is no rushing through anything, no skimping on advice and warnings. It's just solid instruction.

I do get review copies of DVDs, but this isn't one of them.",1341446400,4,3422,4.587561374795417
3746994,5,B001PBK6K2,"Nobody dances like Sadie.  And her DVDs are just wonderful.  This is no exception.

I would recommend this to anyone who is a beginner or attempting to really get their isolations down solid.  It's also quite the workout, but the burn is always good.

3746997,5,B001PBK6K2,"This video is an amazing video for beginners. Sadie goes through the fundamentals of bellydance in which you need to master in order to start layering onto. Keep in mind that no video will ever replace an actual class because you will not have a teacher to tell you if you are doing something incorrect. This can be very damaging physically if you hurt yourself or damaging to your technique because learning movements wrong in the beginning will make it much harder to fix in the future. Nevertheless, everything I learned while I was in my beginning stages of bellydacnce Sadie does cover. Not to mention she explains it very thoroughly. Later on in the video, after you can do the moves she teaches, I think this video is a good bridge to an intermediate level dancer because she does layer her movements with more complex moves. I'm an currently teaching a friend of mine how to bellydance, and I got this video for her to practise at home with. It covered everything I was taught when starting my bellydance with my teacher which I have passed on to her.

The only down fall I found with this video is that when she teaches the vertical figure eights, she teaches it with her heels on the floor. Sadie calls it cheating when you lift the heel. I was taught to lift the heel first because it gives more control until you are comfortable with the movement and have built muscle memory for it. Then it is much easier to do the movement with both heels planted on the floor.

Overall, great video for beginners, a lot of fun, and I  highly recommend!",1333238400,4,1551,4.49290780141844

3746999,5,B001PBK6K2,"i live in an area where I don't have access to a bellydance class (which would be preferable, but it's not an option for me), so I've been using bellydance dvds to learn. From the reviews that I read before buying it, it seemed like a good DVD to buy to reinforce what I already know and also give me extra practice. What I absolutely love about this DVD is Sadie makes you really understand that you can't BS your way into bellydancing. I've been using DVDs to learn bellydance for a while, but after going through HALF of this DVD, my muscles were shaking from the intense workout that I got (and I ride horses - my leg muscles aren't weak!)

She really knows common errors people make with certain movements, either from teaching students herself or mistakes that she made when she was learning. Her analogies that she uses are really helpful. I really like it that not only does she teach the movements, but she also makes you drill the movement afterwards.

Sadie also really helped me with my undulations. I already pretty much understood the movement, but was having a hard time putting it all together and making it look nice. After watching Sadie's section on this DVD on Undulations a couple of times, I pretty much have it down.

This DVD really is the second best thing to actually having a bellydance instructor. If you are like me and don't have any sort of access to a bellydance class, or you are taking a class and just want to practice at home, this DVD is really a must-have. It is so helpful!",1327190400,3,1512,4.451263537906137

3747004,5,B001PBK6K2,"I have never tried bellydancing before: stiff back and waist, stiff arms, fingers, and wrists. I am just doing the warms ups right now so I can get my body ready to move on to the technique and it is amazing how much more control and range of movement I have in just a week's time. It's wonderful how strengthening the stomach can achieve so much in the rest of the body....as well as strengthening the legs. WOW what a toning workout. I NEED NEED NEED the drilling. My posture is even better since my back is strengthening.

I really like Sadie (she is a wonderful teacher. How do I know this? Because I am advancing quickly and can see effects after just one week!) and chose her since I have much respect after seeing her performances but I also am using this to get into shape. She is serious in her teaching and very detailed with explanations but it is also laid back at the same time and makes me quite comfortable to follow her lead. She seems to describe the required movement in all its' detail and you can see her frontside and back and sometime she will change her angle to show you something. You can see every part of her working. There is a bit of humor as well when she puts her arms in a ""cliche"" position as a sort of joke to herself and then continues holding it through the whole instruction.

I doubt I will ever dance publicly but how glorious it will be to be able to move as these women do and I will be just as happy to entertain myself. I would like to learn the more Serpentine type of dance style and I believe I have made the right decision in learning traditional bellydance from one of the Queens.

3747006,5,B001PBK6K2,"This DVD is a little pricier than some of my other bellydance media, but well worth the extra expense. The emphasis is on drills, drills, drills. There is no other way to get the technique. She starts out slowly, breaking down the movement, then quickens the pace, repeating each movement many times until they become almost second nature. One example for me was the undulation. Other dvds contain lessons on undulations but this is the one that finally made it click for me. ""Imagine your chest is a roller coaster,"" Sadie says at one point. ""Your people paid for their ticket and you have to get them all the way around."" Aha. Now I can do camels and undulations. Sadie's pleasant, simple and effective instructions make this workout so easy to follow, even when I'm doing things that are beyond my current skill level. The music, too, is lovely and doesn't become annoying with multiple viewings, as some kinds of music do. Highly recommended for beginners.

It's intended to be enough content for an 8-week course. Sadie is a true dancer and teacher -- graceful, controlled, and easy to follow. Camera work and angles throughout are very helpful.

As others have noted, she goes through the basic isolations and moves of belly dancing, you only get to learn to combine some of them in the choreography section at the end. But it's worth it! The isolations and moves practices are intense! If you're new to belly dancing, as I was, you will find this an intense and challenging workout, especially if you concentrate on the posture and abdominal control that she stresses throughout the video.

I really appreciated her focus on form and technique, which is really what takes belly dance to the next level. I've only had this DVD for a couple weeks but I'm hooked and I know I will come back to it over and over again for its focus on the fundamentals, the advanced muscle control practice and instruction, and her graceful style.

3747009,5,B001PBK6K2,"Another reviewer here already did a really wonderful job of listing all of the chapters in this dvd, so I won't waste your time going over it again.

If you are considering buying this dvd, it's important that you know what it is, and what it is not.

This is a wonderful drills dvd. Sometimes I just want to practice a choreography for the troupe I'm involved with, and sometimes I just want to work on my form.  The latter is just what this dvd is for.  This is a great dvd for perfecting your form, gaining strength and flexability. Sadie does a pretty good job of explaining how to do each movement, and there is enough repetition to get your muscles and muscle memory working! I for one appreciate this sort of thing, because I am terrible at coordinating my own practice sessions when it comes down to just working on my form.

If you are looking to learn a little dance, there is a choreography section near the end of the dvd, and you will learn a cute little dance from that.

If you are looking for an exercise type dvd, like the videos by Neena and Veena that sort of incorporate bellydance moves into an aerobic routine....this is not the video for you.  Also, if you are looking for a fancy choreography, this is also probably not going to make you happy.

The format of the dvd is wonderful.  You can see Sadie from the back and from the front as she is facing a mirror.  This is GREAT! I wish more dvds would have this sort of set up.  This way the instructor does not have to think and correct for rights/lefts the way they would if they are directly facing the camera.  If you have read any of my other reviews I am very harsh on ""teachers"" who say to move right but then move to your left or vice versa.  The lack of coordination between what you are hearing and seeing is very distracting for many people.  That is not a problem in this video at all due to the use of the mirror. For the most part, the camera is focused on where it should be.  Sadie's outfit allows you to see what her body parts are doing without looking like she is just trying to see how much skin she can show.  The background is pleasant and the picture and sound quality are very good.  Instruction is given by Sadie as you go through each movement, it's not done via voiceover (not that I mind a good voiceover, but some find them creepy), and to me, the feeling is just about as close as you are going to get to being in the room with a real instructor as possible on video.

This is a good practice/technique dvd for beginners and intermediates.  I think advanced students might find this a bit too simplistic.  Also, please note, even though I said that it feels ALMOST like being in the room with an actual instructor, if you have never ever taken bellydance lessons before, I urge you to find a real life teacher who can watch what you are doing and make sure you are using proper form, even if you only go for a few sessions. Proper form is essential for keeping your knees and back healthy!  Thank you for reading. :)",1294531200,20,3018,4.268892794376098
3747010,2,B001PBK6K2,"It felt more like a mechanics class on the human body than DANCE.  I am not a novice at dancing and have done many forms of social dance, so I was really expecting to have fun with this vid.  Unfortunately, I felt like the majority of time was spent doing endless drills and relentless stretches...not very fun at all.

If you are looking for a fun workout, this is DEFINITELY not for you.  However, if you have your heart set on learning perfect and rigid technique for belly dancing, this could be your thing.  There is no denying that Sadie is the reigning queen of bellydance, but I just found this vid too daunting to be very much fun.

PROS:  (1) Great Attention to Detail in Physical Technique  (2) Great attention to flexibility and proper posture

CONS:  (1) Not exciting or engaging  (2) DRILLS, DRILLS, and more DRILLS  (3) Can become quickly discouraging, as each drill rapidly builds on the next",1287014400,24,908,4.571428571428571

Perfect for practicing at home, I'm a chemist and runner as well as dancer so my schedule is always crazy. Also wonderful for advancing your individual skill if you're ahead of the game in your belly dance class (if you are taking or have taken one). Highly recommended!",1283817600,2,375,4.696969696969697
3747012,5,B001PBK6K2,"I really didn't know Belly Dancing was such a science, but after watching this  I treat it as more than just shaking the hips. It is a lot of work, I respect Sadie as a pro and really works hard at this, it would take years to be half as good as her, but the journey is the fun and exercise is what I am wanting and how else that to get the best in their field,,, Sadie you are the best, I really don't see how anyone could give a negative rating on this,, unless they just don't know what belly dancing is. Sure there are alot of CD's that just shake the hips but that isn't all this is, Sadie is a pro and has lots of beautful moves, don't waste your money on nobodies, just because the DVD's are cheaper, cause that means the dance is cheaper, this is well worth the money.",1282608000,9,776,3.9743589743589745

And she stresses practice, practice, practice, and while most of us hate that, watching her makes you want to practice until you can't stand any longer.

3747014,5,B001PBK6K2,"I recently purchased this DVD and - wow! This DVD is absolutely worth it! I never write reviews but I had to write one to tell everyone how excellent this DVD is.

First of all, I really enjoyed the pace of the video. The DVD goes quickly and you will be burning by the middle of the video. I didn't even make it to the end of the DVD the first time! Definitely a work out and definitely not boring! The mus

And second, Sadie is a fabulous teacher. The way she explains the dance technique is very helpful! I have been taking belly dance for about 8 months and I wish Sadie could be my teacher locally! All of of a sudden I am able to do moves that I could not achieve in class.

In conclusion my moves are looking great and I am feeling great. Way to go Sadie! Thank you for producing this DVD.",1281398400,6,796,4.025316455696203
3747015,5,B001PBK6K2,"I don't understand the negative review as I wonder if the reviewer has viewed any of the other belly dance DVD'S? I have and they are very stiff in their movement and all they do is cover up dance moves that they are not good at are can't do with dancing with the veil.  Sadie does not do that, you can tell that she dances with excellence. Her performance is untouchable, I have viewed many of the DVD's offered here and none can compare to Sadie.  If you look on Youtube, she has over a million views...... What I can't understand is how some of the other DVD's have great reviews and are bad on performance, they are stiff in their movement.

I don't know about you, but you get what you pay for, and Sadie is worth the money, everyone that I have introduced to Sadie and showed them the other DVD's listed here say the same, Sadie is the best. If you are looking for perfections, and real belly dancing, then Sadie is for you.

If you look at Sadie's history you will see that she has been performing for a very long time and is very good with belly dancing. She is international... many others can't claim that...

Well if you don't get this one, you miss out.. I am glad that I purchased Sadie! Her DVD's are worth your money, time, and investment into belly dancing. This is part of my workout routine and I have so much fun working out with this DVD! It is a great addition to your  work out DVD collection.

My other DVD's are Denise Austin, and Billy Blanks Taebo, both are also great! So it makes for a great variety of work out.

Enjoy!",1280534400,4,1548,4.241496598639456
3747016,5,B001PBK6K2,"This video is very detailed and specific, it makes you feel like you are in the studio with Sadie. There is a lot of material covered in this DVD and it gave me a great workout the first time I watched it! The warmup felt like a workout to me. I would recommend this DVD to anyone wanting to learn the basics of bellydance, it's a fun workout!",1278374400,3,343,4.0588235294117645
3747017,4,B001PBK6K2,I think this video is great for beginner to intermediate. I would not recommend this for people who have trouble keeping up without a lot of repetition unless you want to keep rewinding. She is really good at what she does and i think it is a good buy.,1277510400,2,252,4.163265306122449
3747018,1,B001PBK6K2,"I don't write many reviews, and I hate to write a negative one, but the truth is in this DVD the correct and authentic way to learn and perform bellydancing is not achieved. During the video Sadie teaches the basic famous shimmy and  vertical hip isolations with her feet together, which may be her way but not the traditional way, basic bellydancing is taught by extending 1 leg out slightly bending the knee, lift heel,which you are pretty much on your tippy toe at this point,and the hip should drop creating a slight belly rolling illusion . This is not explained or shown in detail in this dvd, also she teaches different isolations which are very hard to follow and more american like movements, since the techiniques taught are more choreographed in a western way I didn't get that  water like body flowing soft peformance.(that makes you wonder how does she move like that). I think its good workout,it does teach some movements, and on okay video if you know bellydancing and just want to try something different or just looking for a dance video. The show Shimmy is pretty good.",1275868800,24,1088,4.69109947643979
3747019,5,B001PBK6K2,This video gives very good instructions on bellydance basic figures. It also teaches short bellydance routine. I really recommend this DVD for somebody wanting to learn the beautiful art of bellydancing,1275868800,,202,5.548387096774194

I have never danced before but I wanted to take belly dancing classes in the fall and I didn't want o go in there completely oblivious, so I ordered this DVD! Sadie is so graceful and poised. Her teaching is very elementary and easy to catch on, I love this video and will order more from her collection!",1275264000,3,328,4.306451612903226
3747021,5,B001PBK6K2,"I am a beginner at belly dancing and I loved this video. Sadie is great as dancer but also very inspiring as a teacher. She is clear about her instructions and will also give you posture and carriage tips, something difficult to pick up just by doing regular classes. I also loved the fact that she has a warm up session. If you are a little more advanced, perhaps this is not the video for you because the steps here are quite basic. But it was just right for me!",1274313600,,464,4.166666666666667

3747023,5,B001PBK6K2,This is a great DVD for those who want to learn proper technique and not just how to look pretty. It was designed to serve as an 8 week course similar to the one that she offers in Denver and the difficulty ranges from beginner to intermediate so there is plenty of opportunity for growth from this DVD. Sadie is my favorite belly dancer and her teaching ability is unmatched. I like the way that she breaks down the moves into two movements and always makes sure to remind you of proper belly dance posture. She even goes as far as to show you how performing the same moves with the wrong posture throws the whole look of the dance off. My only negative comment is that I wish they would have listed the music that is featured because I can't find the ones that I really like since I don't know the title or artist. This is really a great purchase and a fine introduction to belly dance. I will definitely be sticking with her DVD offerings from now on.,1255305600,32,954,4.276243093922652
3747024,4,B001PBK6K2,"I really enjoy learning how to dance with this DVD!  It seems to go quickly, but since each new element is a different section, it's easy to just go back if you feel like you need more practice.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn the basics of bellydancing.",1252540800,2,275,4.269230769230769
3747025,4,B001PBK6K2,"I was confused by this movie.  The plot was paper thin and it seemed to focus just on belly dancing.  There was no story to speak of, and the cinematography was one dimensional.  There wasn't a lot of music variety either.  But the central character and her struggle through an oppressive regime was truly inspiring.  Sadie (which is the name of one of my cats incidentally - one of two Siberians.  The other's name is Sergei) won me over by her charming personality and her rhythmic hip motions....ahem....  Viva la revolution!

About 10 minutes into the film I realized that it might be beneficial to actually get off the couch and start trying some of the moves Sadie was exhibiting.  BIG MISTAKE.  I guess I missed the warm up...

I gotta tell ya, this movie is not for beginners (or should I say beginner beginners - shlubs like me who make an art out of couch aerobics).  Unfortunately, perhaps resulting from my recent underwear purchase, I *thought* that Belly Dancing was easy.  I thought, ""I gots me a belly, and I can movie my hips, why should this be hard?""  You never see a belly dancer really sweaty right?  Not in any movie I've ever seen.  WRONG.

Apparently you have to ""undulate"" to a beat and do it semi-rapidly.  This fact should not be understated.  I can't carry a tune with a bucket, much less move with anything approaching a rhythm.  By the time I got to a slight break (a discussion on posture) I was sweating like a pig on an August day - and I looked like that very pig twisting and writhing in front of my mirror.  Nothing like Sadie.  Nothing at all...

Also, as a person unaccustomed to any form of exercise, save the rigors of sloth-dom, I could barely move the next day.  My coworkers asked me why I was wobbling around like a cripple.  It's not to manly to say, ""I did a grueling 25 minute belly dancing workout, you know, after my power squats and bench presses"" and yes, I had to take a breather after 25 minutes.  It was either that or start crying.

I chose the more dignified option.  To lie.

""A tree fell on my garage and as I was hacking it apart with a small hand axe, it broke loose and pinned me to the ground.  The strain from lifting the 500 lb tree trunk must have caused me to pull a muscle"".

The only reason I took off a star was because I thought the simple and easy way to make this movie perfect was for Sadie to have done it sans clothing - I mean, that way I could study her exact contours and twists...

Also, despite only going through the dance motions once and a half (don't ask) I've seen this movie about a dozen times.  For research purposes.",1245196800,21,2605,4.3271221532091095
3747026,5,B001PBK6K2,"I purchased this DVD as an instructional aid for a woman I am working with who is interested in belly dancing. I am very, very impressed with the quality of instruction it offers.

Before I purchased this DVD I did a fair amount of research online comparing the dancing skills of a variety of belly dancers. Sadie was clearly the best I saw with amazing control of her body and an excellent ability to isolate different areas. She has an extensive range of techniques which she makes use of intelligently.

I have now watched her video--some parts several times. As someone who has taken some dance classes, not belly dancing, and as a stage director working with theatre choreographers, I can't tell you how impressed I am by her approach to teaching belly dancing.

Her lessons are clearly well thought out and build on the techniques she is teaching. She offers tremendous value and is a pleasure to watch. Her love of teaching and passing on the wonderful skills she has developed clearly comes through.

I could say more but I would just be repeating the raves you will read in the other reviews of this video.

I look forward to ordering more of her videos.

3747027,5,B001PBK6K2,"I bought this dvd and got 3/4 of the way through it when I had to stop for the evening.  This dvd is a very thorough workout.  You're given lots of time to master each isolation as each one is repeated numerous times in various speeds.  My muscles burned (particularly my hips and thighs)and I was drenched by the time I was ready to call it quits.  Sadie really makes you feel it.
  The dvd is easy to navigate through like previous reviewers have mentioned.  Everything is broken down into categories on the menu so there's no fast forwarding required.  The bonus performance is also spectacular.  I really love this dvd.",1240876800,50,623,4.54054054054054

Sadie is a great teacher. Her explanations are clear and precise, and she has a nice manner. This DVD has been a super fun way to learn at home. I've also found this workout to be super effective for back pain and stiffness which is amazing and unexpected.
My only criticism is that there isn't a second quicker warmup included. The one given is already 20 minutes long. Nevertheless, this is one of my favorite ways to work out at home.",1516838400,,540,4.303921568627451

Sadie explains the movements and concepts clearly and in detail, and she also combines a variety of techniques, some of which are primarily for beginners, with techniques that can be added as layers for more experienced dancers.
