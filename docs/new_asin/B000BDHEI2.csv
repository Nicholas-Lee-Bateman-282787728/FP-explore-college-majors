8085619,3,B000BDHEI2,"Overall, not bad to watch but the info here is misleading. What you actually get:

50 clips of No-Gi submissions, mainly from grappling competitions.
50 clips of Gi submissions, mainly from jiujitsu and judo competitions.
10 bonus submissions - at least one had an entire bout, which only lasted a few minutes.

The clips start in mid-bout, run about 30 seconds or more each before the bout ends, then the same action is re-run. Music plays continuously in the background and there is no other audio so no sounds from grapplers or crowd or refs. There is a quick logo at the beginning of each bout which identifies the winner and the competition or location where it was recorded. There is no voice-over describing what is happening, and the holds/attacks used are not grouped together or identified in any obvious way. If you can't tell a heel-hook from an ankle-lock there is nothing here to help you as you watch the action.

The 139 minute run-time is misleading. You are actually watching only about one hour worth of clips but you are watching each of them twice. And ""greatest events in the world""? Well, not if you include the big MMA fights because none of this action occurs in the octagon or the ring. It is all on mats in what look like wresting and judo gyms. Having said that, it is clearly real competition but mostly appears to be at mid-level competency or perhaps high-level amateur. And yes, there are a few clips of women competing.

The inclusion of names like BJ Penn and Diego Sanchez etc is misleading because anyone who recognizes those names will expect to see professional level bouts. This appears to be a video shot and edited by a couple of guys who love the sport but have limited means, so it is only one or maybe occasionally two camera angles. And if you realize that is how it was done it is indeed a pretty good video to have put together. A professionally assembled video would have added voice-over instead of settling for music (there are roughly a dozen artists whose music is used so it isn't repetitive - and if you don't care for the music you lose nothing by muting it). Pros would have also included verbal analysis of what is happening, what hold was used, maybe how it should have been defended against. Nothing against the film-makers but this is NOT an instructional DVD. Only someone who is a competitor and already knows a lot about the holds could learn much from watching this.

TO ENJOY IT - I suggest turning off the distracting music unless you really, really like it. Ignore the names and locations because they really don't matter. Focus on the moves for each bout and see if you can guess how it is going to end and where the critical moment is as it happens. Then when the bout repeats if you want to focus in switch to slow-motion to watch that critical move. This seems to me the best use of watching the same bout twice, you don't have to back-up the video to watch a critical move a second time and if it really interests you it is easy to slow it down as you watch it again. For those who are competing or who want to compete this could be a really nice reference tool, but since I don't compete that is an uneducated opinion.

If it had actually been broken down into groups of bouts by categories of attacks or if the attack type had been listed on screen either before (best) or after the bout then that would have matched the description in the editorial review. I would have rated it higher in that case. However, if you want to watch it by attack type you can ... clumsy but possible. If you look at the bouts by chapter it lists name, place and attack for each bout. Unfortunately there is no way to get back to the 'list by chapter' after the bout plays, it just moves ahead to the next bout. So page through the chapters and note which ones have the attacks you want, you can note down names or just count the number of bouts you need to skip to get to the next one you want to watch. Then after a bout plays use the ""next"" button to skip ahead as many bouts as you need to. If I were going to watch this often I would just make a grid of 100 and make quick notes of attack types, then as I watched it the first time I would make notes of which bouts were the most interesting. Doing this makes a rough guide to let you jump around to just watch the best or most interesting bouts. None of this info is on the DVD jacket and there was no insert so you are just making your own insert as a guide to what is on the DVD. Probably worth it and doesn't take long.

Hope this info helps anyone else decide whether they want this DVD. Better to know what you are getting so that you aren't disappointed. This is not a bad video, just not what I expected based on the description.",1359331200,,4746,4.331833520809899

8085623,5,B000BDHEI2,"This dvd was cool. I didn't know girls were going to be in it giving submissions though haaha but over all, it is a good deal. I looked else where for this dvd and it was like thirty dollars or more. Praise Jesus I found it on amazon hahaha I am no longer afraid of getting in a fight unless it's with a girl who knows this stuff to but ether way I have nothing to fear. God is good :). Over all I got this to protect my girl friend and to teach my kids some day how to defend them self's Plane and simple. I don't want to go on a jiu-jitsu hurting spree that would just be dumb and foolish. I ain't no fool only for Jesus I am. ya",1184544000,2,631,3.7518796992481205
