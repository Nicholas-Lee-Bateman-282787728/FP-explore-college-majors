2378537,5,B000A7Q2KA,"I have been a big fan of Australian movies since '71 when I first saw a very young aborigine named David Gulpilil in 'Walkabout' and have followed his film career ever since. He had a major role in one of my all-time favorite movies 'The Last Wave' in '79, made a very brief appearance at the beginning of 'The Right Stuff' in '83, a cameo in 'Crocodile Dundee' in '86, another cameo in 'Dead Heart' in '97 and then  landed another major role in '02 in the highly acclaimed 'Rabbit-Proof Fence.'

Oddly enough David's signature role was filmed in the same year as 'Rabbit-Proof Fence.' I'm talking about a movie that is totally unknown the the U.S.A. but was awarded the 'Best Film' award and 'Best Actor' award for David by the Australian Film Critics Circle. The film is 'The Tracker.'

This is one of my favorite movies about the Australian aborigines. The year is 1922 and David, known only as 'the Tracker' is guiding three white officials through the outback in search of another aborigine accused of killing a white woman. During the journey 'the Tracker' is forced to endure not only derogatory treatment from the 'the Fanatic' in charge (Gary Sweet) but must witness in silence the arbitary killing of innocent aborigines encountered along way. As tensions continue to build 'the Tracker' quietly plans his revenge and in the end true justice, aboriginal justice, is dealt out.

David Gulpilil dominates this film, he's absolutely amazing! Every expression, every gesture is filled with understanding, rage and humor. This is in every way his movie. Saying that, I also want to make mention of the wonderful supporting role played by Damon Gamean as 'the Follower.' His inner journey of personal transformation is extraordinary and a perfect counterbalance to David.

This film was both written and directed by Rolf De Heer. I'm not familiar with anything else he's done, but I'm certainly going to check into his previous credits. Another important element to this film was one of the most amazing soundtracks I've ever heard. The songs and music were composed by Graham Tardif and sung by Archie Roach. Unlike alot of soundtracks that are used only as background music to enhance the story, here they were an absolutely integral part of the movie. As the band of four traveled through the Outback the music and lyrics told the history and longing of the aboriginal people. I've never experienced anything more moving and emotional in a film.

My highest possible rating! A film to be bought and enjoyed over and over again!!",1130544000,54,2535,4.870069605568445

2378559,5,B000A7Q2KA,My wife and I are avid movie watchers....200 per year minimum.  This movie is by far our favorite movie of all time.  A lot of reviews talk about the theme being of race.  Our viewing evolved to where we saw a huge message of religiosity...Christianity.  Symbolism all over the place.  We have watched this movie at least six times.  All I can say is that you are missing something real special if you don't watch it!,1393459200,,417,4.421052631578948
2378560,5,B000A7Q2KA,"This is a terrific movie with a surprise ending that will make you see how odious the White Man is to those he conquers, and how oblivious they are to the community they can't comprehend.  The story of the Irish Settlers moving into Australia has been one of murder, devastation and genocide.  But what else is new?

The end of the movie is worth a million words.  I was glad to find it on Amazon as I wanted my husband to see it and he was also very caught off guard at the end.  Not what he expected.",1380758400,,502,4.081632653061225
2378561,3,B000A7Q2KA,"This film wants to tell something of the story of the interface between Aborigine culture in the Australian outback and white Christian culture. But it doesn't do a great job. Instead, it is long and wondering and misguided. The men eventually catch up with the suposed murderous suspect but don't actually catch him. Spears appear from nowhere to kill whites. People are shooting innocent women and children for no apparent reason. The main character, the tracker, is innocent in his way but then one gets the impression and eventually learns he is not what he appears to be. The scenery is lovely but equally often hazy. I guess I don't get the point of this film.",1373068800,,666,4.75

2378563,5,B000A7Q2KA,"I gave this a 5 rating because it is an outstanding movie exploring the oppression, use, abuse of Aboriginal people early last Century. The setting in the dry, dusty, harsh Australian outback parallels as a fitting metaphor for the life and times of the Tracker himself, and the other characters. David gulpilil never fails ti impress as one our greatest actors of all time, and his on screen presence is mesmerising and sensitive. His wry, underlying humour brings an added dimension to his powerful performance.",1363478400,,513,5.047058823529412

2378565,5,B000A7Q2KA,"THE TRACKER is a movie from a liberal point of view. Once again a movie in the same context as roots in which people from the African Diaspora don't have the resources to produce their own movies about themselves. It's a wonderful movie though.

It's a movie in which a white liberal filmmaker, writer, and producer took interest from other sources to navigate a story about the trials of the Koori people in Austrailia.

A must see!",1335139200,,433,4.6103896103896105

2378587,5,B000A7Q2KA,"There are five men in this story, none of whom have names.  In the cast list they are called: The Tracker, The Fanatic, The Follower, The Veteran and The Fugitive. This is a brutal story told in a very non-brutal way.  The story is told to us through a folk song.  We see the actors as they trek across the continent led by the Tracker (David Gulpilil) who follows the trail left by the fugitive although none of the whites can see it. The Tracker walks, the white men ride horses. We understand from the beginning that The Fanatic (Gary Sweet) has a fear and hatred of natives that becomes exacerbated as he rides. As they come upon a village of natives, he cannot control himself and here the film could become brutal but while we see his facial contortions, see him mouth the words we hear the folk song and when the actual brutality occurs a native-type painting of the scene appears on the screen so that sensitive folks like yours truly will not be offended by the event. It is like cave art depicting the historical scene.
 As the story unfolds, each brutal scene is depicted thus and the song continues.  One of the men, The Veteran (Grant Page), begins to realize that the hatred is uncalled for and feel sympathy for the natives.  My favorite among a host of amazing scenes is the one long lingering shot of the face of the Fugitive (Noel Wilton) as he walks and then that of the Tracker and then each of the white men in turn.  Nothing is said; you just linger with the camera on each of these men and read their thoughts in silence.  Another great scene is the one where the Fanatic tells the Tracker how ignorant, helpless, shifty et cetera blacks are and why he feels it is his duty to whip them until they learn.  All the while we know that the Tracker is in complete control of the situation and it is our fervent hope that all ends well for him.
 We enjoyed David Gulpilil in ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" and ""Walkabout"" and thought that he was even better in this film directed by Rolf de Heer and filmed in Australia in 2002.  It is 95 minutes long and is available on DVD.  If you cannot find it locally, it is available at Amazon.com.  We give this one a full five stars.",1222905600,5,2184,4.349753694581281
2378588,5,B000A7Q2KA,"I usually prefer to read, but as a tracker of animals and people, this movie spoke to me in a non-literal way. The music, the scenery and the main actor combined to make a piece of moving art, not just a movie. The ending made up for all the cruel things and the tracking was realistic and intense. I loved the way they showed how the tracker was seeing instead of just looking. I will just add that as Bob Brady, another reviewer, liked it that is high praise indeed as I know him to be an exceptional tracker.",1221091200,3,511,4.171717171717172
2378589,4,B000A7Q2KA,"The Tracker (Rolf de Heer, 2002)

Ah, Rolf de Heer, how I adore your movies. You never fail to make my jaw drop, even when I see it coming from a mile away. And you can make anything funny, no matter how horrible, how brutal, the subject matter.

And this is no laughing matter: A tracker (David Gulpilil of Walkabout) has been hired to chase an aborigine charged with the killing of a white woman. With him are The Fanatic (Gary Sweet), the Veteran (Grant Page), and the Follower (Damon Gameau). We do not learn anyone's name in this film; their titles tell you most of what you need to know. The setting is the outback in 1922, when the aborigines were considered little better than the slaves were in America a few decades previous; a black man accused of killing a white woman was relatively sure to face a kangaroo court and swift justice at the end of a noose. Who wouldn't run? Yet, as we start out, we are fully convinced of the man's guilt; it is only gradually that an entirely different story unfolds. And as it does, complications ensue, to the point where the three white men are ready to turn on one another. And at the heart of it all, there is the tracker.

Pointed, darkly funny at times, brutal at others. As with all de Heer's films, the direction, cinematography, and acting are all exceptional. If you are not yet acquainted with the work of Rolf de Heer, this makes as good a starting point as any. I didn't like it quite as much as Bad Boy Bubby, but then that's like trying to decide whether you should go with the double-fudge ice cream or the triple chocolate cake. Either way, you're going to end up satisfied, and somewhat uncomfortably full. ****",1219104000,,1675,4.431818181818182
2378590,2,B000A7Q2KA,"Somebody needs to speak up in opposition to all the five star reviews this film is getting and I guess it will have to be me.  This chase film makes about as little sense as the recent version of ""3:10 to Yuma.""  The posse acts in ways that are downright absurd and that spoils the whole movie.  For example, the first time a spear gets thrown at them they shoot back wildly but make no attempt to chase the culprit, who can't be very far away.  OK, maybe this could happen. But when the next couple of spear attacks happen they just keep right on moving forward following the tracker.  Hey, idiots!  The fugitive is BEHIND YOU!!!  Halfway through the film it becomes abundantly clear that the tracker is NOT trying to help them catch the fugitive but the posse keeps on following him.  Good grief, the tracker even tries to drown the head lawman and they still act like he's their ticket to an imminent arrest.  This is so ridiculous it almost makes the movie a comedy.  Perhaps some other reviewers are blinded by the strident political correctness of this film: aborigines = good, white people = bad.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, we get it already: darn those Europeans for rising above a stone age existence.  Civilization apparently turns all whities into violent, psychopathic brutes.  I'll grant this film does have some nice scenery but the story still has to make sense.",1217721600,10,1369,4.607438016528926
2378591,5,B000A7Q2KA,"I am a seasoned mantracker with Law Enforcement & SAR. I am always skeptical of movies depicting mantrackers, and how they are mostly ""Hollywoodized"".  However,from the very first frame of this movie it had captured my attention, the way the tracker moved along his line of sign, I knew it was going to be a great movie.  It truly is a great movie about a Tracker and how lonely, adventurous and dangerous following a track can be.  There is a very deep and meaningful story being told that goes beyond just a tracker following a line of sign.  One of my most favored movies of all time.

2378592,5,B000A7Q2KA,"When Philip Noyce directed ""Rabbit-proof Fence"" - a film about Aborigine children escaping white captivity - he hired David Gulpilil in the role of the ""black tracker"".  With forty thousand years of experience in the Australian bush under their belts [sic?], the Aborigines are trackers without peer.  The European invaders quickly learned to use them in tracing missing children, criminals and other tasks.  In the ""Special Features"" of ""Rabbit-proof Fence"", Noyce comments on his sudden awareness that Gulpilil virtually redefined the role.  With no lines - none are needed - David makes clear that an Aborigine would find the children.  But he ""misses"" them in passing, glancing over his shoulder to where they were hiding in the scrub.  He presumed the real tracker sent after them had done something similar.  In this film, David Gulpilil is the lead role, and clearly defines it in his own way.  Even writer-director de Heer is unlikely have the savvy to devise a script to achieve what Gulpilil accomplishes here.

The story is of three whites, two of whom are policemen, to chase down an Aborigine murder suspect.  The leader, a fanatic racist, is no exaggeration as Australian history has shown.  The young policeman is an eager innocent, but flexible.  To him it's part of a new job.  The third white is a ""squatter"", conscripted to fill out the group.  As ""The Tracker"", Gulpilil must lead them over a sparse landscape with few clues to the suspect's passage.  The trail is scanty, the man elusive, and the whites are totally dependent on Gulpilil's abilities.  In one scene, as the group arrives at the edge of a stony plain, the young policeman objects that there's no trail to follow.  The expanse of pebbles is extensive and no sign of human passage can be made out.  Gulpilil wearily points out the clues to the young man, who retires abashed as The Tracker smiles slyly.  The hunt continues.

White-Aborigine relations are a sorry record, as this film dramatically portrays.  Gulpilil is scorned and badgered, even by the men who so sorely need his skills.  The hunters encounter a group of Aborigines, and the head policeman banters and abuses them mercilessly.  Although Gulpilil warns that the Aborigines not only cannot speak English, even he doesn't understand their ""different language, Boss"".  Resentful and frustrated, the officer shoots each member of the group.  Holding up his pistol, he declares it to be ""the language of this country"".  The hunt continues.

Director de Heer takes full advantage of the vast beauty of the Australian bush with compelling scenes.  His best talents, however, come to light with the many close-ups of the tracker and white pursuers.  David's expression at the killing of his fellow Aborigines is enigmatic, and he remains stoic throughout the film - until the end.  Even when the leader threatens Gulpilil with taking ""your own ears back with me"" if they don't catch the suspect.  He shackles Gulpilil who must now carry a length of chains while finding the trail.  As the group closes with the fugitive, the tension builds under de Heer's skilful touch.  The hunt continues.

De Heer adds some interesting nuances to this film.  There are scenes introduced or portrayed by Aborigine-style paintings.  The opening is one such, as are the killings of the Aborigine group and others.  Additionally, de Heer uses Archie Roach, one of Australia's ""stolen generation"" to provide the background music - not quite Aborigine and not quite European.  The effect adds fresh levels of intensity to an already gripping story.  And the fugitive?  De Heer's inventive story concludes with a surprising twist, one that North Americans may find daunting to comprehend.  All the more reason to see this film for its revelations.

2378593,5,B000A7Q2KA,"Rolf de Heer's outstanding film, ""The Tracker"" is a visually stunning odyssey through the remote, unforgiving Australian bush and liberally filled with social commentary.

The year is 1922 and a band of three mounted policeman is being lead by an aboriginal known as The Tracker, played by David Gulpilil.  They are following another native Australian accused of murdering a white woman.  The band is lead by The Fanatic played by Gary Sweet, a murderous bigoted Australian, who thinks of native Aboriginals as subhuman.  Along the trail he displays his ruthlessness by shooting innocent blacks the group come across.  Also along for the ride is a young naive Damon Gameau whose morality has yet to be corrupted towards racial inequality.

As the group move deeper and deeper into Aboriginal territory and away from civilization, The Tracker who is chained by the Fanatic like a dog, begins to follow his own agenda within the pursuit.  As they continue, the Follower is forced to choose between the intolerant racist ideology of the Fanatic and fair and broad minded views of the Tracker.

Rolf de Heers brilliant depiction of the despicable racism evidenced in Australia at that time serves as a reminder that the dehumanization of anyone regardless of their differences cannot be condoned.",1158278400,4,1292,5.119047619047619

The film examines who is the criminal and who is the innocent...who has standing in the bush wilderness and who does not.
