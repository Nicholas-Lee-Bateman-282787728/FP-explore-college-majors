8147278,4,B000IS2AV6,"First off, this is the filmed adventure of ONE safari.  It is wonderful to watch, as a travelogue, and piece of history, from the 1930s.  But it does feel like a Dodge ad at certain points and at 48 minutes I would not call it an 'historically important piece of work'.  It is interesting, shows the landscape and culture of Africa but let's not go overboard.  Get it if you are interested in 1936-1937 Africa, parts of it anyway, along with Dodge trucks.  Otherwise, pass it by.",1326758400,,479,4.459770114942529
