186634,5,1565856635,"i got this dvd because of our interest in the universe, My 8yr old grandson was so facinated, we watched some together and have lots to talk about. loved it",1336262400,5,156,4.233333333333333
186635,4,1565856635,"The title My Favorite Universe describes well this short course on the origins and current state of our 13.7 billion year old universe; this figure is reasonably accurate according to the experts, but some debate still exists among researchers.  Neil deGrasse Tyson is our lecturer; he is a respected astrophysicist who is the director of the Hayden Planetarium.  Dr. Tyson clearly enjoys his subject.  Also, he is an engaging and talented speaker.  He fills his twelve lectures with many examples that make it possible for any educated person to understand this complicated and difficult subject.

Unfortunately, the DVD of this course is almost all talk; Dr. Tyson does use some visuals, but not nearly enough, in my opinion.  Many readers of this review will remember Carl Sagan's outstanding PBS program Cosmos, a Personal Voyage.  My Favorite Universe could be much improved with significant investment in the wonderful visuals that made Carl Sagan's series so popular.  As it is, My Favorite Universe would be just as effective on a CD or tape player.  People who enjoy listening to The Teaching Company's courses can take this course in the car on the way to or from work or to the gym to listen to while exercising on an elliptical trainer.  My Favorite Universe is likely to make that latter boring activity much more enjoyable.

I learned much from the six hours I spent listening to Dr. Tyson and now know that when Joni Mitchell sings ""we are stardust"" in her famous song ""Woodstock,"" she is telling the truth.  Who we are, how we got here, whether we have company in the form of intelligent life in the universe, and where we are headed are some of the subjects that interest Dr. Tyson and he shares his findings with much enthusiasm with us.  Recommended with noted reservations.",1332547200,4,1793,4.858552631578948
186636,3,1565856635,"Dr Neil deGrasse Tyson, an astrophysicist and the Director of the Hayden Planetarium in New York, offers a twelve lecture primer on cosmology that is obviously aimed at a public largely uninformed about the beauties of the universe and its mysterious origins.

This lecture series' heart is certainly in the right place but, try as he might, I don't think that Tyson has found the perfect balance that he was doubtless seeking.

The physics of this lecture series is pitched somewhere between non-existent and low. Clearly then, ""My Favorite Universe"" is not aimed at a reader who, for example, is capable of making their way through Brian Greene's ""The Fabric of the Cosmos"" or Stephen Hawking's ""Black Holes and Baby Universes"".

On the other hand, Tyson's lecture series tries to cover so much ground in so little time that, of necessity, he is forced to breeze over concepts so quickly and with so little explanation that it will almost certainly go over the head of a beginner, illiterate in physics, and looking for an easy way into the topic.

That said, Tyson does come into his own when he uses a breathless, almost poetic, speaking style to simply convey his own wonder at the breadth, majesty and mystery of the universe - particularly, if it's an explanation of a concept or a detail that doesn't require physics to grasp.

For example, did you know that our universe, now estimated to be 13 billion years old is comprised of an estimated 100 billion galaxies similar to our own Milky Way, each of which is composed of an estimated 100 billion stars? Our own sun, so critical to our life here on earth is a very average member of that group in almost every respect - composition, size, age, temperature and development! And here you thought we were somehow special!

Did you know that one teeny, tiny thimble full of the material of a neutron star, the densest material known to man (never mind how it actually got that way) would weigh about the same as a herd of 50 million elephants?

Did you know that the combined mass of all of the asteroids in the asteroid belt (quite incorrectly portrayed in sci-fi flicks as a crowded navigational hazard fraught with danger to space-faring gents like Captain Picard) is actually only 2% to 3% of the moon and that 75% of that entire mass is locked up in the 4 largest asteroids in the entire belt?

In short, Tyson does a brilliant job on the ""what""s but falls considerably short on elucidating the ""why""s. Nevertheless, this lecture series is still an interesting, informative way to spend six hours of your life.

Recommended.

7796628,5,1565856635,Anything by deGrasse Tyson is very informative even entertaining. He explains the material in exceptionally clear terms with the right balance of technical and conversational language so the listener/viewer is continually engaged. There is plenty of enticement with each subject covered to inspire further investigation so not only educational but inspiring to dig deeper as interest is triggered. A great introduction to a most fascinating branch of the natural sciences.,1477267200,,472,5.757142857142857

7796634,2,1565856635,The DVD is very worldly and childish. They assume that Darwins theory is now a fact and teach accordingly and their teaching is on a level of someone in grammar school. I do not recommend these DVDs.,1395878400,,199,4.405405405405405

7796636,4,1565856635,"I found each individual lecture very interesting and informative, and Neil deGrasse Tyson certainly knows how to deliver the goods.  But I have to deduct one star because each lecture was about one disparate topic that didn't tie in well with the others.  But the lectures are still worth the cost of time and money and I plan to watch them again.",1389657600,3,347,4.580645161290323
