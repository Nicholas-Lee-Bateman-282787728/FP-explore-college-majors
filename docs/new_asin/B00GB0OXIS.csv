6069607,5,B00GB0OXIS,"I have the first two of the movies in the trio and decided to buy the third, and in no way was I disappointed.
This movie is awesome, A best buy, seriously action packed, and suspenseful.
My recommendation is if you have the chance to buy and watch this movie. DO IT!",1397520000,2,267,4.153846153846154
6069608,2,B00GB0OXIS,"In this episode the Red Guard encounter the remote location for the Nazi ""Lazarus Project"" where they create Nazi zombie soldiers. I have seen so many Nazi Zombie films, at one point I started to pull for them. The first half of the film is the capture and experimentation with the Russian (and one American) soldiers as victims for the Nazi body building zombies. The second half consists of the formulaic escape attempt.

The Nazi commander smokes his cigarette in a annoying cliche manner.

There are ""humor"" attempts. ""Some call it a blasphemous type of alchemy. I call it messy work with lots of mistakes."" The color during the prison segment was pretty well washed out apparently by design to give the film a dark and gloomy feel. I felt it just looked cheap.

While there are worse Nazi zombie films out there, this one didn't make the grade. Will work as a rental if you are a fan of the series.

6069630,4,B00GB0OXIS,"I rarely follow direct-to-dvd horror movies, but the Outpost movies generally deliver the goods. I'm a bit of a horror ""snob"" and I usually can't sit through more than 10 minutes of most releases that aren't backed by a studio. If a horror movies looks really cheap or the acting is distractinly bad, I usually shut it off.  There are hundreds of low budget horror movies that show up on Blu-ray every year, and most look like really bad student films shot with an HD camera and poor lighting. The Outpost movies have always had a more ""polished"" look. The producers of this series obviously want these movies to look more expensive than they are, so they tone down the colors, use atmospheric lighting and try to give the audience some major bang for their buck. I know hardcore horror fans that will never watch these Outpost movies because of the war theme, but they are missing out on some seriously intense mayhem and gore.

Rise Of The Spetznaz is basically a Call Of Duty: Zombies level come to life. Russian soldiers are captured and brought into a secret Nazi lair (the Outpost in the title) where they are forced to battle the undead, creepy experiments and squads of (very much alive) Nazi soldiers. There is gallons of blood, lots of World War 2 carnage and some fairly creepy environments.

The bottom line is, if you want a hardcore Nazi zombie movie without the comedy (Dead Snow), painfully low budget (Frankenstein's Army, War Of The Undead) or dull pace (Shockwaves) Outpost:ROTS is as good as it gets. And for the price of this Blu-ray you can afford to take a chance on this series without feeling burned.",1410998400,10,1625,4.655052264808362

6069634,5,B00GB0OXIS,"Haven't gotten a chance to see the first two but the third ""Outpost 3"" is a must see. And I'm not just saying that because my good friend is the lead character :) The acting is top notch and the amount of blood and gore makes you just want to go out and find some zombie ass to kick. Even my 10 year old son, who believes he is the number one zombie hunter, agrees that this flick is one of the best ones he's seen. Wish we could have seen it on the big screen for full effect.",1400198400,11,477,3.8282828282828283
6069635,4,B00GB0OXIS,"so I guess we skipped to another good one. You know the ""outpost"" story....immortal Nazi soldiers. Well, in this one the 3rd movie...someone had a great idea. go back to the time they were being experimented on and see what happened. Yay! this time it is the Russians that stumble on the outpost. Lots of good fights and gunfire and only a Nazi nurse to be found. this is after all 1945. I liked this one as much as the first, the second one, not so much, but there are some references in this one that carry to our future. Loved the performances and the characters, too. Yep, we root for the Russians. Get the 2nd one if you need to but the first and third...very entertaining.",1400025600,3,678,4.346456692913386
6069636,5,B00GB0OXIS,Wild ride. Third in the series and it's great if you like these movies about nazi zombies that never die,1399593600,3,104,4.25
6069637,4,B00GB0OXIS,"This review is based on the Region B German black edition

This is a prequel story set before outpost and outpost 2, an introduction into the crazy Nazi experiments that were taking place in the secret bunker, set during WW2 a group of elite soldiers find their way there and are exposed to new horrors of the war, the whole movie looks very authentic, great costumes and the sets and scenery are amazing, most of the sets were re-used from the previous films, the cast is very good, the movie has great practical explosions and gun fights and there is plenty of action, probably more action than the last 2, there is plenty of blood letting too with blood sprays and throat cuts etc. and not forgetting the crazy mutated super human Nazi monsters that are unleashed! all in all this is a strong movie with a great set up and it has a couple of slight nods to the originals that lead on, if you like the originals then you will get the story and understand why they made it this way.
This import Blu-ray version is uncut, it is the black edition and comes in a cool looking black Blu-ray case, it says the running time is 107 minutes but that includes the interviews, the running time of this film from start to end is 87 minutes making it officially still 3 minutes longer than the UK 84 minute DVD version. The picture quality is very good on the Blu-ray and is certainly the best version to get for your money, there is also around 20 minutes of interviews which are interesting and explain a lot of detail about the movie and are in English, the movie is region B and plays in full English!",1399075200,9,1594,4.367003367003367

8621834,4,B00GB0OXIS,"Outpost III: Rise of the Spetsnaz (2013)
 Outpost III: Rise of the Spetsnaz marks the third in what we hope will turn out to be the continuing franchise of well crafted, reasonably well acted and successful Zombie flicks from the young Black Camel film production company.  The producers have now, quite thriftily, used the same underground bunker as the set for all three films.  They spent the money saved to improve the look and the feel of the film.  Good on um.
 In this episode we might from the title think we have some kind of a Commie Zombie vs. Nazi Zombie flick a la this theme explored in Dead Snow 2 (which see reviewed elsewhere) but no.  The action takes place in the memory of an elderly Russian, a man who uses vodka to stimulate his reminisces, a more or less typical Russian in other words.  But what he remembers is a terrifying story of fiendish Nazi SS experiments at turning ordinary men into un-dead soldiers.  The SS scientists use a combination of serum and a big electrical machine to do the nasty work.  The machine played a central role in the second Outpost movie.  The Nazis have no compassion on anyone, as we know to our sorrow from actual history.  If the Nazis didn't in real life slaughter the helpless to further their experiments in re-animating the dead it is only because they didn't think of it.
 Writer Rae Bruton has scribed all three Outpost films.  In number III his writing becomes more mature and more complex.  His central characters are Russian soldiers in some kind of independent commando unit who have penetrated to the Nazi bunker somewhere in what at the time was Yugoslavia.  They have no back up.
 A lot of the action is simple war stuff with ambushes, a crack sniper and a lot of running around in the woods.  All this stuff works well because of the careful staging, insitful dialog, carefully stage action and the spot on authenticity of the weapons and vehicles.  I am a deep history buff and using the real thing rather than, in one case, paint ball guns really makes a film better for me.  They use what looks like an actual Opel Blitz truck and a real German army half track.  The Volkswagen light vehicle and the BMW motorcycle/sidecar combination are not as rare but still show the dedication to realism by the prop department.  And perhaps the success of the earlier films that allowed a larger budget.
 The Zombies move quickly and have a highish order of intelligence.  They are also big dudes and the make-up makes them look like the monstrosities they are.  One of the SS officers uses a Zombie in the same manner as others would use a Rottweiler.  The Z is kept on a chain until someone needs to be ripped apart.  Chilling that.
 Kieran Parker directed with intelligence and competence.  This makes his first outing as a director.  We know him as the producer of all three of the Outpost films as well as the screen writer for the first film.  He is joined by Arabella Page Croft and some others in the producer duties.  Croft has been involved with the films from the first and now is associated with other, non Zombie, Black Camel projects.  The young company can now be called a success.
 Brian Lankin, from Scotland, and Hungarian born Ivan Kamaras play the leading Russian soldiers.  Lankin has over 30 credits.  Kamaras enjoys a successful career with over 60 credits, including some famous Hollywood films but mostly in Hungarian TV.  We have been pleased with the acting from the original Outpost but these guys bump it up a notch.  In one of my favorite lines one Russian notes of a young soldier God made you a poet but Stalin made you a soldier.
 Outpost III: Rise of the Spetsnaz gets a solid three brains.  The unrated film should carry an R rating for some of the most violent Zombie attacks ever and very realistic flesh rending.  They filmed it in 28 days and made Yorkshire and Glasgow look enough like to Balkans to fool me.  The run time comes to one hour and 24 minutes.
 My only quibble is that sometimes the gunfire effects to not match up to the actors actions.  I know, picky.",1443225600,,4071,4.549586776859504
