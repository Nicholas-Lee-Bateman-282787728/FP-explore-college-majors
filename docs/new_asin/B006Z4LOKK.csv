5037704,5,B006Z4LOKK,"Arguably the most fascinating WWII documentary ever. Few historical accounting's prove this enthralling (even to my wife.) It is about the British Special Operations Executive [SOE] established by Churchill himself, admonishing spies to ""set Europe ablaze."" They did, and this set provides 13 episode proof which contain narration, archival & new footage, survivor testimony, experts, photos, some reenactment clips, and all historically & entertainingly produced. Color and much in B/W, no attempt to colorize the 1940s film.

A must own for spy thriller, WW2, military, history, and political fans. Or those willing to try something completely different and astonishing.

It's a toss up as to whether it's more educational or entertaining. I submit 50/50. I began listing fave episodes till I realized it was them all. Helpful facts for the novice about British intelligence: MI6 = Brit. Intelligence Espionage Service; MI5 = Brit. Home Counter-Espionage Service; SAS = Special Air Service. The single drawback was noticing frequent duplicate use of archival film clips in different episodes. Even so, the set is worthy of 6 stars.

SDH SUBTITLES available.
1 SPECIAL INTERROGATION GROUP= SIG, least known intelligence/espionage group, summer '42. 40-German speaking Jews cause bedlam behind the Nazi lines.

2 HARDY AMIES: OPERATION `RATWEEK'= Fashion designer Amies, friend of the Queen, SOE spy, gay, in no-rules warfare. Belgian resistance.

3 THE MAFIA CONNECTION= Boss `Lucky' Luciano sentenced 50 yrs but died free after his secret dealing with the US forces. German spies were on the docks (control by Mafia) giving info to Nazi subs. Huge shipping losses required a unique remedy.

4 DOUBLE AGENT TRICYCLE= Yugoslav, Popov, double agt Ger/MI6 gathered info on Japan that FBI failed to heed. German codename IVAN- TRICYCLE to Brits, & the James Bond of reality.

5 THE BANKER, THE NORWEGIANS, & THE BOMB= WWII success depended on a nuclear bomb. Who first? SOE spy sent to stop Hitler's bomb.

6 THE ENGLISH SCHOLAR & THE FIGHT FOR GREECE= Oxford's Monty Woodhouse, SOE agent, led partisans to liberate Greece & spurns civil war.

7 THE DUTCH DISASTER= 1-by-1 SOE agent drops in occupied Holland were into Nazi hands. Why? Nazis called it a game- ""English Game"" or ""Radio Game."" Who's responsible?

8 THE SAS ITALIAN JOB= Nazi HQ in N. Italy a SOE target, not without inter-conflict & defied orders. Included Italy partisans now fighting against Germans who were driven to the north.

9 THE SPYMISTRESS & THE FRENCH FIASCO= 1 woman at the core of SOE occupied French raids may-may not be competent &/or patriotic. Dead agents tell no tales.

10 THE FRENCH TRIPLE AGENT= Could a rival Brit intelligence group be a factor in the collapse causing many agent captures? Tale of Henri Dericourt offers clues. MI6 or SIS?

11 CHRISTINE GRANVILLE: POLISH SPY= Churchill's favorite spy able to survive all danger but one, it came after war's end. The original Bond girl inspiration.

12 AGENT GARBO= Spanish double agent decorated by both sides. Fooled even the Fuhrer. The self-made spy who saved D-Day. Extraordinary.

13 THE ARISTOCRAT & THE BALKAN COMMUNIST= SOE links with Communist Yugoslav partisan with a multi-agenda. A risk worth taking?

Sorry about the lengthy review, but after watching the almost 11 hours set, you'll wish there was more. Bonus booklet has more.

5037706,3,B006Z4LOKK,So many tv shows with little new information now put out with the same bits of film seen hundreds of times. This was only slightly better than average.

5037708,5,B006Z4LOKK,What we didn't learn in school. Excellent Documentary on little known facts about those who risk and/or gave their lives in order to make a difference in the face of pure evil. Highly recommended.,1363564800,,196,4.794117647058823
5037709,5,B006Z4LOKK,"I learned things about WW2 from this series that I never knew before. EVERY episode was very interesting and extremely well done. (See the other 5-star rating for a complete summary.) The Times(U.K.)said of the series: ""Incredible tales of top secret espionage missions."" They were right.

5037713,3,B006Z4LOKK,This is not an entertaining DVD. It is about secret things that went on during WWII. Some of which are very sad. The incompetence of some in authority makes one wonder how the Allies won the war. I expect many on the Axis side were as incompetent as well. Listen to this DVD and be informed.,1343347200,,291,4.214285714285714
5037714,3,B006Z4LOKK,"I had this company's documentary about Hitler's body guards. It was first rate. This presentation is completely different. It has loud mood music. It has visual effects such as rapid changes in the video image. These things are distracting in a documentary. In order to pad out the presentation to 50 minutes, additional scenes are added that are not from the situation being documented. It leaves out important information. For instance in the North African episode it failed to say that the British had terrible tactical radio security. The Germans collected much intelligence from this.  The Germans had special radio direction finding units that triangulated the locations of the British forces, including commando raids. Also, the Germans had broken the British codes. This is how they had two weeks advanced notice of one of the raids. In order to disguise this, they attributed the cryptography information to human spies.

Another thing not mentioned in the documentary was that SOE was riddled with Soviet agents. I suspect that this included the general in charge who in turn put Soviet agents in the top London management positions. Some of them defected to the Soviet Union after the war. Part of the Soviet agenda was to allow the Germans to kill off everyone who would have the capacity to fight against a Soviet take over of their country after the war. This would explain the numerous cases of apparent crass incompetence in London that are documented in this series. It also explains the crass incompetence that are white washed in this series such as doing nothing when there was hard evidence that all of the Dutch agents were captured.",1334966400,13,1655,4.992753623188406

8506734,4,B006Z4LOKK,"While this DVD set is similar to the programs that originally aired on the Military History Channel (same scripts), the episode titles and narrator were different. These episodes were longer than the versions shown in the US which were edited to insert commercials into a 60 minute times slot. Unfortunately, with my player the format of the DVDs would not allow them to be played in color.

All in all the series is an excellent summary of the role and operations of the Special Operations Executive begun by Churchill to disrupt the Nazi occupation of Western Europe. The results were mixed. The Counter-Intelligence units of the Abwehr and Gestapo outwitted the SOE on several occasions leading to the deaths of many agents in concentration camps.",1459209600,,750,5.0
8506735,2,B006Z4LOKK,"This show was dorky. It's a story about some soldiers who set out to do some amazing things, but ultimately failed. The forced drama in the narration is tedious. The story is basically good, but THEY FAILED. So, why play it up with so much ""drama""? I don't recommend it.",1441756800,,270,4.42
