4238372,3,B00404ME1U,"First of all, do not listen to any of these people saying it sucked!  They all made the same reference...""It wasn't anything like Evil Dead"".  It was stylized to the same similar filmography but was nowhere near that!  The ""Quiet Earth"" comment on the cover that reads ""Sick of waiting for Evil Dead 4? Check out Damned By Dawn"" ruined it for most of these people who are bad mouthing the film.

So...rent it...watch it...and make your own opinion of it.  Anyone that talked badly about this film saying it was ""Horrible"" and ""The worst movie ever"" I challenge you to make a better one...the only thing scarier...watching the terrible B-movie you would create!

It was ok, I'd watch it again, but not awful!",1316995200,2,707,4.661290322580645
4238373,5,B00404ME1U,"Best horror movie of all time!!

Damned By Dawn is in my opinion for the perfect blend of horror movie, gore and shock horror .. Independent.
I do not compare him with other horror films, because he can not be compared ..
Just the atmosphere .. .. the fog of fear, when the banshee screams are absolutely unique and scary to implement this great idea.
Big respect to these crypto brothers .. the best horror film I've seen so far ... Buying tip!!",1313280000,4,446,4.373493975903615
4238374,1,B00404ME1U,Don't fall for the comparison to Evil Dead on the box. This movie is crap from start to finish with ghosts that are about as scary as a Scooby Doo cartoon and a story with more holes than a bowl of Cheerios. I found myself fast fowarding through most of this to shorten the torture.,1307577600,3,282,4.1454545454545455
4238375,2,B00404ME1U,"Damned by Dawn is a 2010 independent horror film directed by Brett Anstey and tells the story, I think, of a banshee who is trying to damn a family.  I think.  The details got lost in all of the fog being blown around for the last hour and a half.

To be fair, the movie actually started off fairly well.  If you're an Evil Dead fan, you'll recognize immediately a similar film style utilized here, but only at an environmental angle.  The moving ground shots through hazy nighttime forest, etc.  It's a nod in the right direction, so I feel I owe Anstey some recognition for that.  He also did a decent job of spooking me.  Every so often a form will move silently through the background and it's startling.  Well, the first ten times it was, I should say.  He must have known it was working because he kept doing it and doing it and doing it, and...

...THIS is where I start stomping on his effort.

The film went nowhere.  It gained a little momentum in the beginning, but quickly began bleating one note and stayed that way through its entirety.  Keeping my hand away from the fast-forward button on my remote because I promised myself I'd not review the movie unless I'd seen the whole thing was exhausting.

The banshee got on my nerves right away.  The screaming was obnoxious.  I know that's what banshees DO, but it drove me nuts.

The main actress wasn't very good.  At all.  She basically spends the whole movie going from panicky to wide-eyed and back to panicky, rinse and repeat.  At one point in the movie, she's on a balcony looking down and her eyes are huge.  Cut to a different scene, then back to the balcony and she's looking down again with an almost identical face.  She just kept doing that.

Weakest zombies ever.  One undead guy walks into the house, gets their attention, dumps his guts on the floor, then starts flaccidly punching at them.  When he connects, they act as if they've been hit by a Thor's hammer, but there's no way.  NO way.  If anything, this movie gave me hope that when zombies finally do start perusing my populace, they'll be walking daffodils like the creatures in this little ditty.

The music was sporadic and poorly placed.  Multiple genres fluttered around carelessly until the end scene when one of the worst songs I've heard brings the whole house crashing down around me.

I don't know what else to say.  I wanted to like the movie, but I just could not.  At one point I even tried to get excited about a tear in the father's cheek because it reminded me of similar wound handed to Lionel's mother in Dead Alive, but then I realized that while watching one movie, I was fantasizing about another, and that's a disappointing thing to happen to a guy.

Unless you're the type of person that's trying to watch every movie with, ""Dawn"" in it, I'd avoid this film, and I'd avoid this film really hard.

4238377,2,B00404ME1U,"This title is not to be confused with the famous and far superior Evil Dead moniker, ""dead by dawn"".  The first 50 minutes of the film go by pretty well.  The legend of the banshee seems to be used quite effectively.  The sets every now and then almost come across as fairy tale-like, especially the scenes in the mine.  That's the first 50 minutes.  After this, things quickly go to hell as folklore gets substituted by clich&eacute; and everything stops making sense.  As for the raison d'etre of the film, the dead, you have to have a certain love for flying, scythe wielding skeletons to get your full boo's worth, or boo crap, if you don't lean towards this kind of dead.  The acting was pedestrian to competent, nothing to light the sky on fire or anything.  For me, there were some continuity discrepancies; unless I wasn't paying attention, I could swear that I saw a father and son running from a mine at night, and then the father being let into the house in obvious daylight.  The story itself could have been better.  The banshee was awesome, probably the best one ever put on screen.  Just you go try and figure out the last 10 minutes of the film, though! And about the pop song just before the credits roll....",1295136000,9,1225,4.497737556561086

I like the set, the mediocre effects, and the Banshee herself is so cool! I would recommend getting this if you want a unique take on classic folklore, and enjoy campy horror movies that aren't afraid to take the risk of including an atagonist that is severely underrepresented in the genre.",1524096000,,449,4.69620253164557
8412010,2,B00404ME1U,Im Irish so I was glad to see a movie based on the Banshee folklore. Sadly. The movie just isn't great. Lots of people running around the woods at night and not much intensity. Felt like the plot got made up as they filmed the movie.,1520121600,,233,4.086956521739131

8412014,1,B00404ME1U,"Damned by Dawn (Brett Anstey, 2009)

Usually when I say they weren't even trying in a review, I'm talking about the worst thing about the movie/book/whatever in question. And when you've gotten to that level, there's usually not that much farther to descend. However, just as there's always at least one faster gunslinger out there, there's always one step below the worst thing you had ever thought you'd seen. When I say that Damned by Dawn's scriptwriter, director, and various assorted other connections weren't even trying to disguise the movie's status as a shameless ripoff of The Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn, I'm telling you the best thing about this movie. Yes, believe me (because unless you are a glutton for punishment you will never, ever want to watch this movie): it gets worse.

If you've seen Evil Dead 2, the plot here will be very familiar to you. The only difference is the method of demon-infection, which here comes from a banshee (Bridget Neval in her big-screen debut). Other than that, it's pretty much identicala bunch of young-and-beautifuls turn into demons and try to kill the final girl. You know, your usual weekend getaway.

You sit there watching some movies, at least if you're me, and you keep asking yourself how in the world they got made. Damned by Dawn is one of those movies. At least it doesn't try to hide this; the DVD cover of the Australian version has the tagline sick of waiting for Evil Dead 4? Check out... Nice to see that someone had a sense of humor about it, at least. I, on the other hand, didn't. Everything about this movie is awful. The acting, the direction, the soundtrack, the lighting, the cinematography. I'm sure the catering was sub-par. Maybe that's the key. Had they got a caterer who knew that beef wellington wasn't make from emu... *",1407369600,,1800,4.707936507936508
8412015,4,B00404ME1U,I find Damned by dawn to be both unusual and intriguing in it's corniness. The effects are low budget but it adds to the overall feel: a movie underdone enough to be interesting. I absolutely love the Young Heretics song at the end which completes the mood.,1403222400,,257,4.48936170212766
8412016,4,B00404ME1U,"DAMNED BY DAWN is a  very entertaining little film. I had avoided it in the past because the title was so obviously lifted from one of my favorites. I ran across the trailer on YouTube by accident and was intrigued.

It is true that the movie is not perfect. For instance, the reviewer who pointed out the continuity error with an abrupt nighttime/daytime shift is correct. It could also be argued that the story over all is pretty simple. On the other hand the story moves pretty efficiently as a result.

I disagree about the actors being pedestrian. I think the whole cast was very competent. The lead actress, Renee Willner, does well with what she is given to do. Once things start flying through the air all around, it is time to react and respond, rather than stop for introspection. On this level, she provides what is expected of her. Bridget Neval is very creepy as the ""woman of sorrows."" I understand that banshee scream is actually her--without any digital augmentation, except to loop the scream for length.

One of the things I really enjoyed about DAMNED BY DAWN is that it is just dripping with atmosphere in the same way CITY OF THE DEAD (aka HORROR HOTEL) is. It might have served the story better if the locale was not fog-enshrouded from the instant the story begins and transition into it. However, it still made a good impact on me--informing me that this movie is more concerned with a feeling of dread than bloodshed (although there are a couple gory parts). The film utilizes background glimpses of shadowy horrors and peripheral vision to effectively build this feeling of dread.

I think Brett Anstey  delivered admirably more than should have been expected from the film's miniscule budget. The film is fairly well paced and builds to a satisfying climax. I am looking forward to whatever his next film turns out to be.

If you don't overthink it, DAMNED BY DAWN  is a good way to spend an evening--with the lights out!",1389484800,2,1948,4.675438596491228

8412018,3,B00404ME1U,"When you choose to have a title for a horror film that includes words like this feature does the expectations of the viewer increase. You'd better deliver the goods or horror fans will do little more than ridicule the name over and over again, citing the title in their jokes and slams. If you can deliver the goods, then you make a movie that fans can enjoy. DAMNED BY DAWN is just such a movie.

A slow start finds a young couple going to the home of Claire to visit her grandmother perhaps for the last time. Her boyfriend Paul finds the family a bit off kilter but not enough to make him run for the hills. When Claire sits at her grandmother's side to talk about the mysterious package (an urn) her grandmother sent her, she's told she is the only one her grandmother trusts with its care. She knows her time is coming and wants her grand daughter at her side to insure nothing prevents what is to happen.

That night the inevitable does happen and grandma dies. At the same time a storm whips up outside and Claire looks out the window to see something unexpected, a visage in white flowing gown, eyes bleeding and packing a scream that sends her reeling while opening the window. The banshee is here to take grandma's soul. But Claire unknowingly interferes and puts not just her grandmother's soul in jeopardy but the lives of everyone inside as well.

The dead rise and take wing, tracking down everyone in the house as they try to figure out what has happened. When Paul goes for help, he's attacked by a scythe wielding creature that flies at him. His body is later discovered by Claire's father and a neighbor who was visiting. As those who survive in the house are taken out one by one, Claire must figure out just how to put a stop to the banshee before everyone dies.

A rather simple story, the movie opens at a dreadfully slow pace but don't let that prevent you from watching as it gets better. The usual mind set needed for a horror film, suspension of belief, needs to kick in to truly enjoy the film but it does offer some truly creepy images and sounds. The cry of the banshee, a mind piercing scream, is one that jolts you while watching the film. Coupled with the images of the banshee it might be something that will cause a few sleepless nights for those who scare easily.

The movie is not Oscar worthy but it does offer a decent horror tale with a new twist on an old legend. The acting is up to par and the effects are well done. Some are obviously CGI effects but at least they do a good job with them here unlike the weekly dose of sharks or pythons dished up by the SyFy network. If you're looking for a decent horror movie you could do worse but at least this one has some heart, talent and desire to be considered a well done piece. It succeeds on several levels and is worth watching.",1354233600,,2819,4.341555977229602
