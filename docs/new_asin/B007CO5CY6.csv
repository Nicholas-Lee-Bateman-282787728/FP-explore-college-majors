Every time I see the two Japanese girls, my heart just lights up.  And that's just one small element of this amazing, complex, riveting, inventive, brilliant, entertaining, enlightening, truly original show.

I used to watch every episode of 24, great or not, and missed seeing Keifer in a show, but he is back, decidedly different, but even better than before.  And Touch is not without suspense and thrills.  Not the same level as 24, but just as well produced, and really exciting.

In this emerging world of Quantum Physics, Alternate Realities, Quantum Entanglement, and Parallel Dimensions, we should never feel insecure about any of these scientific discoveries, or the changes around us, or doubt that there is a plan.  As the events in this wonderful show portray, everything actually is connected.  There actually is a Universal Mind.  And as impersonal as this may seem to some, it really couldn't be more personal.  The characters on Touch learn that Unconditional Love is the most powerful force in the Universe.  And every week we learn right along with them.

Thank You to everyone involved in the production of Touch.  You make my heart sing, my brain think, my mind expand, and my soul light up with pure joy.",1338854400,4,1369,4.865800865800866
