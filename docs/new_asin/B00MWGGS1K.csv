6602905,5,B00MWGGS1K,"My husband and I got our true history lesson as to the causes of WW1, this series is totally absorbing and the intrigue behind  each  of the  countries involved in the ""making"" of WW1 was unbelievable.

 In school they never really explained why WW1 occurred, except for the assassination  of Franz Duke Ferdinand and his wife, Sophie in Serbia. Nothing beyond that.

The ""37 Days"" DVD was excellent and the actors impersonating the historical figures were convincing. We learned so much from the episodes of this DVD, along with ""Churchill and WW1"" and  ""Royal Cousins"". So happy we purchased this collection.

Totally recommend this collection to one and all, including history buffs!",1424304000,15,686,5.053571428571429
6602906,5,B00MWGGS1K,"Absolutely one of the best sets I've purchased and a great value.  37 Days, a mini-series about the political events that led up to WWI, is worth the price alone.  The other disks are equally worthy to any history buff.  Walter's War is a short movie that should have been made longer, but the disk includes a well made docudrama about the Battle of the Somme that is worth watching.",1420934400,12,383,4.442857142857143
6602907,5,B00MWGGS1K,"IF YOU HAVE NOT BOUGHT ANY OF THESE TITLES YET, YOU SHOULD REALLY CONSIDER THE WHOLE PACKAGE!

Each one of these programs are really exceptional, though not always perfect.  For me, they were purchases not just rentals so a complete package is a great deal depending on the price.  The common thread is WWI though they do not intersect much in any other way.  Each one has a very different focus.  The first two however, give the most complimentary subjects as they focus on the political contributions to starting WWI on one hand (37 Days), and the Royal Family rivalries on the other (Royal Cousins at War).  There is plenty of great insight, haunting footage of WWI and the royal families, and tremendous individual stories in the case of Winston Churchill and Walter Tull.  For me, this collection was a must own!  Below is a synopsis of the four programs included with links to individual sets.  I have placed more detailed reviews on each product page at those links as well.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/37-Days/dp/B00KSEAMAG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">37 Days</a>&nbsp;-- Fully dramatized docudrama with the main perspective inside the British Foreign Office and the German Chancellery.  It also includes diplomatic figures and some small glimpses of the Royal Family perspectives (See Royal Cousins for more in this area).  Though this is a full length dramatization, the dialog is amazingly reconstructed from official records, telegrams, messages and other accounts to create an extraordinary piece of history telling.  It illustrates the personal interests of those in power, the absurdity of some events and miscommunications, the political jockeying inside governments to maintain relevance of ruling parties, and the profound result these accumulated effects will have on the world.  It is not an action piece.  However, this dialogue driven show is fascinating and profound in it's view.  You are seeing the innermost perspective of what went horribly wrong.  There is very little else like it out there regarding WWI.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Royal-Cousins-at-War/dp/B00KSEAMT2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Royal Cousins at War</a>&nbsp;-- Narrated documentary with plenty of dramatized scenes.  This show illustrates how the rivalries began within Queen Victoria's family and the likely reasons why Kaiser Wilhelm was the way he was.  All this adds a compelling counterpart to the docudrama listed above.  The film footage of the royal families (including Tsar Nickolas' family) is haunting.  Just seeing them playing together on vacation in Denmark (without Wilhelm) was extraordinary.  I loved learning the story of the two Danish princesses that married into the English and Russian royal families and helped affect the non-traditional alliance between Russia and England despite the German background of Victoria's family.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Churchill-s-First-World-War/dp/B00KHBVP4W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Churchill's First World War</a>&nbsp;-- This is the story of how WWI formed Churchill and how he affected the war, more than it is the story of WWI from Churchill's famous books on the subject.  It is the story of his fall from First Lord of the Admiralty at a very young age, only to descend into the trenches and rebuild his political career.  It includes his amazing partnership with wife Clementine to meet his date with history.  The show illustrates his foibles and eccentricities, though I would still say they are slightly understated to maintain a positive view of Churchill and his astonishing resurgence to solidify his place in history.  I was also interested in his promotion of technology that affected tank warfare.  Mainly narrated with plenty of dramatized scenes.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Walter-s-War/dp/B00KHBAKN4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Walter's War</a>&nbsp;-- 3 Star program with a 5 star extra (see below). This show is a partially fictionalized dramatization that doesn't do Walter's story justice.  It also is not to the historical standard of the other three programs.  Walter Tull was born of mixed heritage to a father from Barbados and mother from Britain.  His grandmother was a slave in Barbados.  He was a professional footballer for Tottenham Hotspurs and Northampton town.  His heroism prompted his superiors to recommend him for commission despite a law specifically prohibiting people of mixed-heritage from exercising command, making him the first black British Army officer.  He fought in both Italy and France, including the Battle of the Somme.  He was also only the second mixed-heritage footballer to play in the top division in Britain.  The program handles much of the interesting earlier parts of Tull's life only in flashback and focuses mainly on his struggle at Officers Candidate School.  However, the story itself is significant.  ***The important thing to note on this release is the inclusion of the outstanding but short documentary Somme: From Defeat to Victory.  It is partially dramatized with narration and historical footage included.  This inclusion makes the individual title (Walter's War) a buy where normally I wouldn't.",1414108800,64,5304,5.799741602067184

8675054,5,B00MWGGS1K,"Each component of this collection is excellent. I am particularly enthusiastic about ""37 Days."" There are countless pages written about the lead-up to World War I, and the topic can be mind-boggling. This DVD is astonishingly clear with well-acted characters. You will be amazed at how quickly the worthless catastrophe of millions of death brewed because of alliances that had little connection to the crime of the archduke's assassination. Highly recommended.",1462752000,4,461,5.507042253521127

8675060,3,B00MWGGS1K,"Broken down in four stories on four discs.
First was 37 days. Well done and I thought the best. Talks about the events and diplomatic sequences leading up to the declaration of WWI
Second Royal Cousins. Cousins yes, Royal yes, but it ends there.
Third Churchill's. Overstated bio of a ambitious political family.
Four Walters War. The least interesting of the four.
Hence my three stars. By the first two separately if you are able.",1436659200,5,432,4.773333333333333
8675061,5,B00MWGGS1K,Good set of interesting videos.  Especially enjoyed 37 days.,1433289600,2,60,5.666666666666667
8675062,5,B00MWGGS1K,"Where does the viewer begin in watching this set of recordings?  Since I was most interested in Royal Cousins at War, I started with that one.  Probably, it was the one most suited to give the viewer the most background information about the family ties of Queen Victoria's descendants and how spread across Europe they were.  The specific descendants addressed in Royal Cousins at War were King George of England, Tsar Nicholas of Russia, and Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany.  The cover photograph is of King George and Tsar Nicholas, and how strikingly similar they appeared.  A viewer could even surmise they were twins.  Kaiser Wilhelm is not photographed.  I viewed second Churchill's First World War.  This too was quite interesting.  This program shows how Winston Churchill began his long period of service to country, first as a military man in the British Navy and then the British Army, before politics.  It also showed the devotion between Winston and his beloved wife Clementine.  Third recording viewed was 37 Days.  This starts with the events leading up to the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand and his wife Sophie by Serbian mob.  In both high school and college, all that was said about World War One was this assassination as the cause of World War One, and nothing else.  This is a drama, in the spirit of many historical dramas produced by BBC, but attention to detail and little artistic license make this production well worth the time and effort to produce it and worthy of viewing, by anybody even remotely interested in World War One.  In fact, if a viewer wants the minimum of time devoted to learning about World War One, this might be the best recording to fit this circumstance.  Finally, I viewed Walter's War and the bonus feature The Somme - From Defeat to Victory.  I had only heard the name Somme prior to viewing this program.  Somme is a river region in France, where massive loss of life for England, France and Germany occurred in a very short time span.  Walter Tull is Negro who had served as a non-commissioned officer in the British Army who was sent home to recover from ""Trench Fever"" and then recommended for officer training in Scotland, the only Negro at that point to go thru officer training, graduate and serve as an officer before dying on the battlefield.  It shows the prejudice and a couple of flashback memories he rises above them during officer training.  There were, even British Army regulations that forbade Negroes from being commissioned and leading subordinates.",1429142400,15,2522,4.859484777517564
