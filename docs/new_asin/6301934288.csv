381885,5,6301934288,Very nice collection of the classic tale on DVD. The DVDs are a sure pleaser for the little ones! Thanks!,1351728000,,105,4.3
381886,5,6301934288,We purchased The Wind in the Willows Four-Pack.  It is beautifully done and the packaging is  excellent.  They are just the way we remember seeing them the first time they aired on television.  We hope the other seasons will be offered as well as this was one of our all time favorite series.,1343260800,,292,4.452830188679245
381887,5,6301934288,"Ever since I sat down with my family back in 1983 and watched the very first episode on Aussie ABC, we fell in love, just waiting for the next installments to appear at 4.30pm every week. This Cosgrove / Hall version has to be at the top of the heap. Two thumbs up to the producers, directors, animators, and voice actors.",1329350400,,322,4.295081967213115
381888,5,6301934288,"This was my wife and daughter's absolute favorite show from A&E from back in the late '80s and finding it online made me the best husband and father ever!  The lovable story line, the well develop characters, and the level of sophistication in the still-frame animation, character detail and background are superb.  As soon as A&E releases seasons 3, 4 and 5, we'll own it.",1301011200,,373,4.723076923076923
381889,5,6301934288,The absolute best of the best!  I enjoyed every minute of each DVD and will watch them over and over.  The quality is amazing and I loved the 'extras' on each season.  I look forward to the next season soon.  Loved them!!!,1254700800,,222,4.214285714285714
381890,5,6301934288,"I would pop in the video cassette of the original Wind in the Willows film and instantly forget any problems and be entranced with the incredible story. Cosgrove Hall's rendition of Kenneth Grahame's book Wind in the Willows is definitely the best one out there. The sets are stunningly beautiful and the stop motion technique is divine. The cast is top notch which included David Jason as Toad, Michael Hordern as Badger, Ian Carmichael as Rat (Peter Sallis swopped voices with Ian Carmichael after the original movie.) and Richard Pearson as Mole. They each brought so much personality to each one of their characters.  So when I found out that Cosgrove Hall made a Wind in the Willows television series I was ecstatic. I decided to buy this collection so I could have as many Wind in the Willows DVD's that have been released by A&E.

When I popped in the original feature-film on DVD I noticed it has not been re mastered but I was glad to find out this film has not been edited. It will be seen in its entirety, and A&E has also supplied us with scene selections. One of the most memorable scenes of this film was when Toad, Badger, Rat and Mole fight the weasels to claim Toad Hall. Attention to detail is why this film is so excellent.

There are some nice bonus features none that are not really extravagant but nice to say the least. There is an interview with Brian Cosgrove, a photo gallery, some character descriptions and a trivia game. I was hoping for a making of which would be very interesting but it's nice to even see this film on DVD.

The second product in this collection is The Wind in the Willows the Complete First Series which includes thirteen episodes. I was surprised when I found out that the stop motion, the sets and the voices were just as good as the original film. The stories are excellent entertainment and run around twenty minutes per episode.

The Further Adventures of Toad - Badger makes Toad send letters of apology.

The Kidnapping of Toad - Toad walks into a trap, but the weasels get more than they can handle.

The Ghost at Mole End - Mole and his guests are perplexed by strange, spooky noises.

The Great Steamer - A steamboat passes and Rat and Mole must rescue a drowning mouse.

Buried Treasure - Badger has till noon to vacate his home.

Mole's Cousin - Mole is nervous about his visiting cousin.

The Grand Annual Show - The weasels win the sliver cup for their enormous pumpkin.

The Open Road Again - Toad, Rat, and Mole help field mice who have lost their home.

Wayfarers All - Will Rat leave the comforts of home for a life of adventure and mystery.

The Weasel's Trap - The weasels set a trap for Badger, but it catches someone else.

Burglary at Toad Hall - Mrs. Carrington-Moss opens Toad Hall, and the weasels try to ruin the festivities.

The Piper at the Gates of Dawn - Otter's son goes missing, and the search leads
Mole and Ratty to Pan Island.

The Yuletide Entertainment - Badger produces a Christmas variety show that is nearly sabotaged.

The bonus features include in episode already released from the second series entitled Gadget Mad, also included are character descriptions.

What I found out by now is that Cosgrove Hall really cares about making the best stories possible and that's why they have the best rendition. The third product is The Wind in the Willows the Complete Second Series which also includes thirteen episodes.

Winter Sports - Toad faces the weasels to be Champion of the Winter Sports.

Toad: Photographer - Toad Hall has a new portrait on the wall -Toad's!

Patient Toad - Rat and Mole are worried Toad's cold is something far more serious.

The Harvest - Thanks to the weasels, an afternoon of fruit-picking nearly turns rotten.

Auberon's Return - Toad supplies the visiting Auberon with a brilliant idea for a new play.

The Great Golfing Gamble - Toad tries a new game after giving up croquet.

Gadget Mad - Toad's efforts to electrify Toad Hall nearly end up in disaster.

May-Day - If Toad isn't careful, the weasels might swindle Toad Hall from him.

Fancy Dress - A costume ball at Toad Hall is nearly ruined by the weasels.

The bonus features include an episode from the third series entitled Mr. Toad's Telephone and once again character descriptions.

Unfortunately there are no signs that A&E is going to release the third series anytime soon so don't count on it.

The last product included in this set is the second feature-length film entitled The Wind in the Willows a Tale of Two Toads. The first thing I noticed was that there was a little less attention to detail in the characters faces which was a little disappointing. But this is still an excellent film to own.

The bonus features include another episode from the third series entitled Paperchase, and yet again character descriptions.

This set includes every Wind in the Willows product yet released by A&E so if you already own the DVD's there is no point of buying this. That said, if you have not bought the DVD's this is a perfect collection to buy. This is a must have for the Wind in the Willows fan.",1178928000,10,5372,4.59916054564533
381891,5,6301934288,"The Cosgrove Hall production of The Wind and the Willows, along with the subsequent television series and A Tale of Two Toads are positively charming and delightful.  This collection gives you the original movie, the first two seasons of the show, and the A Tale of Two Toads movie, which has an episode from season three included.  This set is perfect as a first introduction to Cosgrove Hall's The Wind in the Willows or for anyone who remembers it fondly from childhood.  Once you've seen one episode or film you'll want to see it all so go ahead and order yourself the set!  (It's much cheaper that way too as opposed to buying it all individually.)

I cannot say enough in praise of this series.  The voices and attention to detail are absolutely stunning.  Watching this again as an adult I was blown away by the quality of the animation, characters, and sets.  Much of the humor is subtle but other moments are laugh out loud.

I will say that when I was younger I found the original film to be a bit slow.  I appreciate it much more as an adult.  The TV shows, however, are great for all ages and perfectly safe for all ages.  I do wish they would release the other three seasons of the show on DVD!",1177459200,20,1207,4.387387387387387
381892,5,6301934288,"I purchased this product even though I had the first two seasons. I had sold them a few months ago, and wanted to see the movies, so i decided to buy the whole set. It allowed me to view the 1st and 2nd season again as well, so it was good. Would really, really, love it when A&E release season 3,4, and 5. I have got some episodes from season 5 on tape, but can't wait for the others. If you haven't seen any of the Wind of the Willows, buy this as it allows you to see what all the fuss is about.",1162512000,16,498,3.798076923076923

Be a frugal shopper though, don't buy 4 pack @ $180+ crooks are all over. Save yourself $140 buy each set individually.",1393113600,,334,4.566666666666666
