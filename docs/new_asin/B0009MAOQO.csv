2299418,5,B0009MAOQO,"The Yu-Gi-Oh! seasons before this one never interested me very much, but this one really got my attention. There is a lot of ancient mythology woven into this storyline and a few preludes to set up the Dawn of the Duel story arc (the second half of Season 5 and the final story arc of this series). For those who just want to see card tournaments in cartoon form, however, this may not be for you. The storyline is much more involved than a few friendly (or not so friendly) card games, and the battles do seem tedious compared with wanting more of the story to be revealed. It seems like people who loved the first three seasons were not as fond of this one, and people who weren't impressed with the first 3 seasons loved this. One of the defining moments of this arc, the first duel with Rafael and his Guardians, will take place on Season 4 volume 2 (the next DVD, due out in Feb. 2006). Personally, this is my favorite Yu-Gi-Oh! season of all.

List of episodes on this DVD:

A New Evil (Parts 1 & 2) - Yugi's Egyptian God Cards are stolen by a mysterious group of motorcycle punks. Yugi chases them, only to find a strange old man who uses a sinister card called the Seal of Orichalchos to lock Yugi and himself in a duel to the end. The winner walks free, and the loser becomes a prisoner of the ""Great Beast"".

Legend of the Dragons - Yugi's dreams lead him to the World of Monsters where the Dark Magician Girl begs for Yugi and the Pharoh's assistance and introduces them to their new friend and the first of the dragons to be awakened: Timaeus.

The Creator Returns - While Yugi and his friends plan a visit to California to meet with Pegasus, Seto Kaiba and Mokuba find out someone is trying to take over their company. Left with little choice, they make plans to confront the threat to their livelyhood.

Deja Duel (Parts 1 & 2) - Seto and Mokuba travel to the Duelist Kingdom to confront Pegasus, or is it Pegasus? During this Duel the second dragon is awakened by Seto: Critias. Meanwhile, Yugi and his friends are en route to meet with Pegasus in San Fransisco.

An Unexpected Enemy - Yugi and friends find themselves stranded next to an abandoned gas station when their driver mysteriously vanishes. As a large motorcycle band threatens them another biker comes to their rescue, and Joey insists that it was Mai Valentine who saved them. When they reach the Industrial Illusions headquarters, however, they are confronted by an angry Mai weilding none other than the Seal of Orichalcos.",1135900800,14,2503,4.49010989010989
