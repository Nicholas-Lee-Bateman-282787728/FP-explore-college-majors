6481636,5,B00LEW3JII,"The only reason Comedy Central should still even be programmed on your television is this show right here. Jordan Peele and Keegan Michael Key are two of the absolute funniest comedians and sketch artists of contemporary art. With their stellar sketch themes and characters, fantastic writing, and impeccable pacing, the show is a perfect snapshot of what they do and how well they do it. Season 3 was no different, and the writing and acting was stepped up quite a bit. Be on the lookout for Season 4 if you like real comedy.",1414713600,4,526,4.666666666666667

6481670,5,B00LEW3JII,Any season of Key & Peele is over a 5 star rating.,1444694400,,50,3.25
6481671,5,B00LEW3JII,"I came late to the party. They had been on TV for about five years before I found out about them. As far as I'm concerned, this is the funniest two-man comedy team since Laurel and Hardy, based on the number of times I laughed till I cried. Different eras, TOTALLY different approaches to comedy, but sidesplittingly funny, especially if you know and have had experience with the types of characters they do. There's TRUTH to the impersonations they do.

Another thing that impressed me right away is the production values of the skits. The sets, the costumes, the makeup, the special effects are as high-value and as detailed as anything you'd see in a full-length movie. And of course the two guys: excellent actors. Peele is a total chameleon. He can do anything. He dives deep into the character. Key is excellent too, usually as the outraged straight man. And the ideas: who in the HELL comes up with these ideas?? Off-the-wall, totally original -- no one has ever thought of these out-of-left-field plots!

So if you want to laugh until your drink squirts out your nose, get a K&P! ",1444003200,,1088,4.68586387434555

6481716,5,B00LEW3JII,"I own all 3 of the seasons, #1,2&3 and i must say this one is the absolute best! So many good skits,P***y on the Chain Wax,The Mr. T & Funk videos. The Levi skit with Foghorn Dickhorn & Ratatoui. The black Republicans meetings,The Halloween episode  is great. The crackhead landlord & Gerald. The Mattress of Solitude cracks me up so much. The black ice skit is funny. The East/West bowl with Equine Ducklings,Squeeeeps & Fudge. The McCrimgleberry skit. The slapass with Garcia. Wasting the 40's is funny as hell. The Star Wars skit,the homosexual workplace harassment, Mr. Mehina,Emenez & the skit at the police station reading the posters. The Shafte/Othello skit is HILARIOUS ! The crazy guy in the pawn shop ""christmas shopping"" looking for arrows,dynamite,a zipline,rollerskates,half a suit of armor and a big money bag had me laughing so hard i was crying. The skit about the spanish gang is at a meeting with his boys and Jordan falls onto a table,or should i say Carlito. He's lying on the floor in pain whining and moaning.
The funk video where Key & Peele are on bass guitars,i have the same style guitar as Jordans,it's called a Dean Dime Razorback. I own several Razorbacks,they are mean sounding guitars & i'm gonna order.the same bass Jordan had in about a month. There like 1,200.00$
I said before i love every season,i have seen every episode and followed them on tv when they came out. I was blown away it is hilarious,if i'm having a bad day all i gotta do is burn 1 or 3 and watch some of my favorite episodes. I love every season all 5 stars but this one stands out as the funniest ever. I recommend you pick it up. Every season is great,the best part is THERE ALL UNCENSORED !!! That right there is a bonus that makes it 100x better than tv. Makes it awesome. I wish oldschool South Park episodes from the first 1-7th season,especially the first 4. South Park is my favorite. Check em out !",1421884800,7,1911,4.571428571428571
