1199404,5,B00000EZWV,"Despite the listing on the box as a B&W film, it is actually in Trucolor.  Thus, this is the first release of Sunset in the West in full color. Visual and sound qualities of this video are excellent with very  good color qualities.  This is a full length version with a running time of  67 minutes.  Sunset in the West is the 17th out of a total of 19 released  by Republic in Trucolor.  Highly recommended for Roy Rogers' fans.",950054400,21,428,4.275

1199406,5,B00000EZWV,"Unbelievable the restoration of this old Trucolor film, Sunset In The West.  Better than new.  Grew up watching Roy Rogers movies and still enjoy them.  This Blu-ray restoration of one of his films is super great.  Hopeful more restorations of western Trucolor films will be forthcoming in the future. Would be great on some the old Rod Cameron western movies.",1497657600,,360,4.95
1199407,5,B00000EZWV,Excellent western which is frequently considered one of the best of the Rogers' westerns. Penny Edwards is Roger's leading lady and carries her own in one of her first western outings.,1496620800,3,184,4.967741935483871

1199410,5,B00000EZWV,"Good quality prints of Roy Rogers' films are a bit like hens' teeth! However, Kino Lorber have excelled here at reproducing this film in its originally-intended print quality. They are to be highly commended. I am just hoping more are to follow....

1199413,5,B00000EZWV,"This first Blu Ray for a Roy Rogers film in TruColor
is the sharpest, best quality image I have ever seen
in any format for the William Witney westerns.
If any of you have any interest in the preservation
of Roy's films, SUNSET IN THE WEST is the one
to buy!
It is so much a toss of the dice over the past decades
if you buy any of Roy's films, on VHS or DVD,
so many of the prints are cut by ten minutes or more,
and the duplications are often smeary and dark scenes
become almost impossible to make out.
Not here.
Hopefully if Kino Lorber does well economically with this
first restoration, un-cut preservation of a Roy Rogers film
they will try to find a way to preserve others.
I can't stress enough how much the sharpness of the
Jack Marta's cinematography film impressed me.  I suspect I have
never seen one of these films so at any time in my life.
Impressive enough that I made myself write this review
before other things got in the way and I might never
have gotten around to it.

It's too bad his TV show didn't go color because he and Dale were such colorful characters of the old west. Great film!!!",1368576000,4,285,4.2

1199420,5,B00000EZWV,"This hard to find video arrived quickly in good condition.  A good, old fashioned cowboy flick about Roy Rogers...the singing cowboy.  Back in the day when kids sat around the nighborhood tv and watched cowboy movies together.  Roy Rogers had a special appeal with his songs, his nearly human horse and his beloved dog.

This is a fun movie...made for the innocent at heart",1304812800,5,373,4.78125

1199423,5,B00000EZWV,"This is a fantastic discovery for Roy Rogers fans! To my knowledge, this makes 11 out of the 19 Roy Rogers movies that were originally made in TruColor that are still available in color. I think this would be a good ""colorization"" project...to restore the rest of these movies to their original ""glorious color"". And as for those who are against colorization, they can't say that these movies were intended to be in black and white. Black and white just doesn't do justice to the Golden Palomino,Trigger,or to those colorful western outfits that Roy and the rest of the gang wore in those movies. Let's hope they put out a dvd version of this movie real soon.",1112054400,10,659,4.641025641025641
