7429140,1,B0155YRG84,"I haven't seen this season, and based on what I have seen of Amy Schemer, I won't be looking to! Amy is just not funny, not funny at all, which is sad. I actually purchased about three of her DVD's, looking forward with some great level of expectation to some riotous humour. How wrong I was. How disappointed I was! So I made a pledge to myself. Never ever to watch anything of Amy Schemer again. As Amy Schemer IS JUST NOT FUNNY. No funny! Not Funny! Not Funny!!!!!!!!! Not at all!!!!!!! And I Like Humour. I love humour. And Amy just kills humour. Murders it!!!!!!",1450051200,,567,4.3584905660377355
7429141,5,B0155YRG84,"Strong season with great skits.  Loved ""12 Angry Men Inside Amy Schumer"".",1449964800,3,73,5.083333333333333
7429142,5,B0155YRG84,"If you agree that Amy Schumer is hilarious, you will love this season of her show. The ""80's Ladies"" episode is my all-time favorite! Lots of fun.",1448841600,5,146,4.444444444444445
7429143,5,B0155YRG84,"My son Damon J Gillespie is on disc one. Season 3 episode 2 ""Girl You Don't Need Makeup"". I can't watch this season enough! Great quality & packaging. Absolutely nothing wrong with this product. EVERYONE should get 1 or 2 or 3 or 4.",1465862400,,232,4.295454545454546
7429144,5,B0155YRG84,"Amy Schumer is hilarious! She's not afraid to tackle any topics. Completely irreverent. Fantastic female comic.  I hope we see her in many more films, stand-up routines, and seasons of this show.",1463270400,,195,5.09375
7429145,5,B0155YRG84,"Hilarious!!! Amy is the best!  A little too vulgar at times ,but WHO CARES??? I absolutely love her! Thanks, AMY!!!!",1460592000,,116,4.8

7429149,5,B0155YRG84,"In Season 3, Schumer finds her voice. She goes beyond the simple crude (yet funny) jokes used in Seasons 1 & 2. She delivers clear messages in well-written, hilarious skits. For me, the best episodes are ""Last...Day"" with Tina Fey, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Patricia Arquette taking on how Hollywood treats aging actresses; ""12 Angry Men..."" with Jeff Goldman, Paul Giamatti & Nick DiPaolo - 12 male jurors heatedly debate if Amy is hot enough for TV; ""I'm sorry"" pokes fun at women's tendency to over apologize; ""Cool With It"" where Amy is in a boy band's music video about the overuse (and then apparent underuse) of make-up; and ""Fight Like A Girl"" where Amy is the sensei in a dojo that teaches men how to interact with women without incurring their wrath.

If you liked Amy before Season 3, you'll love her now. There's plenty of reasons why Season 3 won several awards. If you've never seen Inside Amy Schumer, jump right into Season 3 and you'll be glad you did!",1454630400,,967,4.654970760233918
7429150,3,B0155YRG84,It was okay. I liked the first two seasons better.,1453939200,,50,4.1
7429151,5,B0155YRG84,"This package lacks any stand up material, which is a loss for her fans. The episodes can be seen for free at Comedy Central web site so you really don't need this.

Still, as usual, it's filled with great insight.

Amy is the best female comedian, and she will also make great movies in the future.

Woody Allen, Larry David, Sam Kinison, and Lenny Bruce come to mind.",1453334400,,368,4.382352941176471

8732779,2,B0155YRG84,"Amy Schumer has great comedic timing. She's quick, she's witty, she's young but she is so raunchy with her subject matter. I do appreciate the topical commentaries on women's rights and her observations of hollywood, but geesus, what's with the sex organs? One segment is about some transexual and her/his life. Who cares?! As if that is being brave in this world. You want courage? Look to all the non-celebrity individuals out there doing amazing things for others. Sure her stuff can be funny. But comedians like her always die young. They're forgotten.",1482969600,,556,4.989247311827957

8732782,1,B0155YRG84,"I'm so sick of this burnt-on-demand BD-R nonsense. Either release real pressed discs, or license the show to a smaller label that would be happy to do a proper release themselves. Its absurd to pay full price for burnt discs that won't work in all players and won't last as long as factory pressed discs. If I wanted a burned disc, I'd burn it myself.",1474675200,5,351,4.415384615384616
