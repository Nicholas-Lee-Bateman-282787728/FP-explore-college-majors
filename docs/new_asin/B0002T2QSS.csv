2118365,5,B0002T2QSS,"Oh My Gosh! I loved Sonny and Cher and their TV show. I remember I would never miss it. You have to remember that back then... you didn't have these network conglomerates with a gazillion channels; plus the internet and all it has to offer. Probably seems like a boring lifestyle. But really you know thing where soooo much nicer back then. People actually talked to each other. You nit only knew you next door neighbors but you most likely knew everybody who lived on your street... at least for a couple blocks. Anyway Sonny and Cher were a wonderful addition to my evening. This DVD is a nice trip down memory lane. Go ahead and buy it. You'll never regret it. It's like the old lady says when you ask... what do you regret. She says one never regrets what he/she did do.... only the things he/she did not do become regrets.
So there you have it folks. Do not delay... go ahead and buy it. Do it today.. Do it NOW!!",1481932800,,918,4.312138728323699

2118399,4,B0002T2QSS,This DVD will take you back to hopefully a better simpler time.

2118401,5,B0002T2QSS,Me and my 10 year old daughter watched this several times over the holiday season.  It brought back great memories for me and my daughter really loved it too.

2118403,4,B0002T2QSS,"Good DVD, but wish their was more dancing! Not much dancing in the episodes. It was interesting to see Cher more confident between each Christmas episode.  It was also great to see Shields & Yarnell has puppets!  And Captain Kangaroo and Bernadette Peters!!!  The last episode is a little sad as Cher and Sonny are no longer together and you can tell by they sadness that comes across Sonny's eyes off and on.",1356480000,,409,4.575342465753424
2118404,4,B0002T2QSS,"Being unfamiliar with this duo (I came into the world just about the time that this show was ending), this is the first real exposure that I ever have received to Sonny and Cher as a comedy duo.

I wasn't sure what to expect, but I find the show to have been very well-written and performed, and as most fans probably knew already, Sonny was the talented one. He drove the entire series.

It's rather fascinating to me to peek into the popular culture of previous eras like this. Hard to believe that a show like this one could succeed today, with its lengthy skits and musical numbers. Our microwave society would get bored.

As a DVD presentation, this also is a good one, which includes one cool extra: a music-video showcase of all of the songs over the three Christmas episodes collected here.

Good pickup for someone who, like me, loves Christmas specials; great pickup for fans of the team.",1354924800,7,898,4.559006211180124

2118407,4,B0002T2QSS,I enjoyed watching Sonny & Cher growing up & it is nice to view the episodes from their show.  Nice DVD to have if you are a Sonny & Cher fan.,1295827200,,142,3.5806451612903225
2118408,1,B0002T2QSS,3 OF THE SAME TYPE CHRISTMAS SHOWS FROM 3 DIFFERNT YEARS? SOME HUMOR I WAS A CHILD WHEN THSES ORIGINALLY AIRED AND THOUGHT I would watch them as an adult. Now I am wondering how these 2 every got a show the entertainment was slow at times and poor acting no thought skits. Would only recommend if you are very bored in life and have saw most every movie made.,1293408000,,359,4.142857142857143
2118409,3,B0002T2QSS,"OK, there is some good music here. However, the attempt to drag their daughter Chastity into these specials kind of distracts from the program. There are a few fun bits on the program but I don't believe some of the ""spontanious banter"" is as spontanious as advertised. Still, it is a fun show from the days before militant athiests used the ACLU as a club.",1292198400,,357,4.507692307692308

2118412,4,B0002T2QSS,"3 great classic variety show with Sonny and Cher and Chastity (who's now Chaz!)... the comedy sketches may be lame, but it's worth the few bucks just to see those fabu Bob Mackie 70's costumes he did for Cher and cast... and of course, there is Cher's singing!",1258675200,,260,4.4375

2118414,3,B0002T2QSS,"I remembered these two being much less corny than they appear now, but the music was great.  I didn't care for the ""Sonny's Pizza"" skit in each of the three episodes, as they seemed to go on forever and weren't very funny.  They also must have recorded the episodes live because the stumbling over words and long pauses are all in tact.  But the elderly people I care for (in their 90's) seemed to like the episodes just fine and thanked me for playing them.  At least it was in color and the costumes were very entertaining.",1228176000,5,525,4.381443298969073
2118415,3,B0002T2QSS,We used to watch the Sonny and Chair show regularly and this was good but not as good as expected.,1201478400,,98,3.95
2118416,4,B0002T2QSS,"A very good quality DVD apparently from the original video/film. It's interesting to see how TV productions have changed since then and how silly they are compared to now. The shows bring back memories of how Sonny and Cher came across as a decent family compared to their hippy/rockin' start and how well they seemed to get along together. It shows how they ""grew up"" with the rest of us. Well worth the cost for the fans and TV history collectors.",1199750400,,449,4.555555555555555
2118417,2,B0002T2QSS,"This is something I would only watch once.  It was too repitious. Nice to see something from the past, but once is enough.",1198886400,2,122,4.304347826086956
2118418,5,B0002T2QSS,"This is a single DVD release of ""The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour"", that contain three Christmas themed episodes.  They originally aired on CBS in 1972, 1973 and 1976 respectively.  The first show in 1972 has special guest William Conrad who also starred on his CBS show ""Cannon"" at that time, who appears in a few of the sketches, including one where he plays a street corner Santa.  Another segment in this episode is a memorable animated music video part of the series where Sonny and Cher sing Three Dog Night's ""Black and White"" that was a hit that same year.

In 1973, William Conrad guest stars again on another Christmas show.  This time, playing different characters like a vagabond visiting homes on Christmas Eve.  Plus a sketch where Sonny Bono shows Conrad a fictitious Christmas album, ""Sonny Bono Sings Christmas Songs"".  There's a lot more to see on this show too!

The most surprising episode of all, from 1976, was their 'post divorce' holiday show, appearing with their daughter Chasity and a surprise guest, Bob Keeshan as Captain Kangaroo from his daily series also airing on CBS that time.  Hey! Watch where Bob Keeshan in a ""Sonny's Pizza"" sketch where he plays an unusual kind of angel flying over people dining alone on Christmas Eve.  You'll really flip yourself over this!

You won't find a great true 1970's holiday treasure DVD like this one.  Sonny and Cher's Christmas shows is a 'must have' for DVD collectors today!",1192665600,24,1446,4.786290322580645

2118420,4,B0002T2QSS,"Yes, it has all the usual Sonny & Cher show skits, bantering, music, etc.  I'm bothered by it though, because I know that right before the taping of the first Christmas show, Sonny & Cher had a big blow out.  While they were in Vegas that November of '72, they basically cancelled their remaining Vegas gigs and decided to end their personal relationship.  The show continued, but it was all an act (a pretty good and convincing one at that, but unfortunately the tabloids had figured it out).  It's strange to watch them up there goofing, with Sonny and his garlic mistletoe and Cher's broken fingernail....when you know they're both struggling to get through it.  The show continued that year and through the 3rd and final season, but it was never the same again....and forget about that post-divorce Sonny/Cher disaster of a show.  The magic was gone.",1130544000,6,854,4.775510204081633
2118421,5,B0002T2QSS,"Have yourself A Merry Little Christmas with the Sonny & Cher Christmas Collection DVD! How wonderful for us to have Sonny and Cher celebrating the holidays on this great new DVD which is sure to become a Holiday viewing tradition for many!

The collection contains the Christmas episodes of The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour and The Sonny & Cher Show wrapped up in one great DVD! The shows are full of laughter, music, and holiday cheer along with the unmistakable Sonny and Cher banter! Chastity, joins Sonny & Cher for a number of scenes to make the family holiday complete! Guests include William Conrad, Bernadette Peters, Shields amd Yarnell and Captian Kangaroo!

""Jingle Bells"", ""Oh Holy Night"", And a Christmas medley that includes a very young Chastity singing ""I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Clause"" are just a few of the musical highlights!

Regular segments including ""Raggedy Sonny and Raggedy Cher"" and ""Sonny's Pizza"" are given a holiday twist along with lots of segments created just for the holiday episodes.

This must have Christmas Collection DVD is a great follow-up to ""The Sonny and Cher Ultimate Collection"", a 3 DVD set which was released last year. The Ultimate Collection which has a new low price was worth every penny at it's original price and is also a must have for Sonny and Cher fans as well as anyone who enjoys relaxing, fun filled evenings of great musical entertainment !",1100995200,42,1399,4.841004184100418
2118422,5,B0002T2QSS,"Well, I doubt you'd be reading this unless you are a Sonny and Cher  fan, so I'll concentrate on the highlights of these sweet holiday-themed shows.  And, I hope you like ""Jingle Bells"", because that's the song that opens all three shows!

Both of the first two shows feature William Conrad (television's 'Cannon', which was also the inspiration for the skits they used to do with everyone in huge 'fat suits' in case you remember those) and Chastity as their only guests, with their crew of regulars joining in more than usual in the comedy and song bits.  Conrad seems to be having a ball, particularly while doing some pantomime bits as a vagabond bumming some Christmas cheer.  For a guy who was mainly known as being a great 'voice' (he was Matt Dillon on radio's version of Gunsmoke and the announcer on Rocky and Bullwinkle), he is very effective in these silent skits.  He also appears to do some singing, even trying a solo during the Victorian Village Caroling part of the second show.

Perhaps they meant to continue this tradition (Christmas shows with only Bill Conrad as their guest), but Sonny and Cher's divorce meant that a few years passed before their next Xmas outing (or, in their case, Ex-Mrs outing?).  Chastity, Bernadette Peters and Bob (Captain Kangaroo) Keeshan are the guests on the final show, from the 'divorce show' years, with Elijah Blue Allman making a small appearance as well.

A nice package, the only extra being a 'video jukebox' of some of the musical highlights.  No commentary, but considering how spare Cher's remarks were on the three-disc package of the shows, I don't think we're missing much.

One cavaet-the first two shows only run about 35 minutes each, so it looks like there must have been some music or other copyrighted material that had to be omitted.  Anyone know what was cut out of these shows?  The last show runs almost 45 minutes, which is what you would expect of an hour-long show without the commercials.",1099267200,72,1968,4.752941176470588
