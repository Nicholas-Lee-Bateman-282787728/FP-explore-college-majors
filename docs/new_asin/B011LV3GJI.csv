7334554,4,B011LV3GJI,"Is this 2014 doc. in any way the same as the wonderful ""Carry It On"" from the same director, Jim Brown?",1482969600,,103,3.9523809523809526
7334555,5,B011LV3GJI,"This 78 minute documentary on the iconic folk music trio  Peter Paul and Mary  who, along with the Kingston Trio, brought on the folk music revival of the 1960s  was produced and directed by Jim Brown (who has a history of great folk music docs about Peter Seeger, Phil Ochs and others). It aired on PBS  during a fund-raising campaign in 2014 (which marked the 50 years since the band formed) and it was available for large pledge amounts. Now everyone can see it at home thanks to its distribution in 2016 by Music Video Distributors. And its great

The story starts when manager Albert Grossman puts the three individuals together in 1964 and there is basically no history of the individuals themselves. This is about the group. The archival footage that Brown gathered  from commercial TV shows, PBSs 25th year reunion and even heart-rendering video from the memorial service for Mart Travers, who died in 2009. While not all the [performance clips are complete, there is enough to satisfy most general fans. All the hits are here.

There is no one narrator and the majority of the story is told by Peter Yarrow and Noel Paul Stookey (with some archival interview footage from Mary). We also hear from Peters former wife and his daughter, Bethany, and from Noels wife and three daughters too. Both PP&Ms former and current managers are here as well.

When I saw the film on PBS in 2014 and again this week I was struck by the fact that, while other artists in the performance footage were identified on the screen, the fourth member of PP&M  guitarist Paul  Prestopino, is shown in nearly every clip but neither identified or interviewed. (Their bassist Dick Kniss died in 2012).

The DVD has chapter stips for each of the full songs so you can return to them And there are FOUR full bonus performances in the Special Features section.

If you remember the folk era and haven t seen this film, youll love this DVD. If you saw it on PBS, youll find it worth revisiting  along with the bonuses.
I hope you found this film both informative and helpful.

7334556,5,B011LV3GJI,What a fine tribute to an important group in the music world. Saw Peter in concert with his son recently and he is still delivering the PP&M message of peace and humanity. They were always true to their message and their art; as this video illustrates.,1470182400,7,252,4.5
7334557,5,B011LV3GJI,"It may seem like long ago, or it may seem like yesterday, but when Peter Paul & Mary became overnight wonders, it was partly because they walked the walk as well as talked the talk. They sang anti-war songs and got themselves on Nixons enemy list. They sang civil rights songs and got themselves arrested. Peter Yarrow, in the introduction to this show says, In the early 60s, those of us who shared the Villages crucible of creativity, looked at ourselves with fresh eyes. Listened to one another with fresh ears. The world was changing fast.

But they wouldnt still be so widely remembered 50 years later if they hadnt sung amazing songs. Im not saying that every song on every album (this was back when there were albums) is a hit, but they had so many notable songs. I was fortunate enough to catch a concert on their Farewell Tour (a farewell because Mary Travers was losing her battle with the side effects of chemotherapy). The audience sang along with half the songs, particularly Five Hundred Miles and Blowin in the Wind.

The story on this DVD starts with how it began, how they got together as a group. It takes us through their first year, 1963, when they had 3 albums in the top 10 and were a huge commercial success. Then through their 50 years together, and even after Mary's death.

There are tons of interview clips, news clips and, most enjoyably, many many concert clips, formal and informal. An example of the latter is a newsreel where Ossie Davis introduces them on Martin Luther Kings March on Washington and they sing Blowin in the Wind.

Commenters include the members of the group, Mary Travers, Peter Yarrow and Noel Paul Stookey, in current and past interviews, as well as Betty Stookey (Pauls wife), Alicia Travers (Marys daughter), Ethan Robbins (Marys husband), Gloria Steinem (writer/activist), Martha Hertzberg (current personal manager), Mary Beth Yarrow (Peters ex-wife), Anna, Kate and Liz Stookey (Pauls daughters), Julie Thompson (co-producer Survival Sunday), Ken Fritz (former personal manager), Pete Seeger (singer/songwriter/activist) and Christopher Yarrow (Peters son).

There are also excerpts from Mary Travers 2009 funeral. This had performances and speeches, including Bill Moyers, Whoopi Goldberg and George McGovern. And John Kerry saying, I think if Mary were here shed look out at all of you and say, Its like a class reunion of Nixons Enemies List!

I very much enjoyed the story and well as the music. This video was originally released in December 2014.

If you're going to sing the music, ya gotta live the music.

7334562,5,B011LV3GJI,"I've seen Peter Paul and Mary four times in live concerts and was always amazed by the precision of their guitar work and the power of their words and voices. This album fills in the gaps in terms of the social context of their work; the essential nature of folk music as story telling. Jim Brown has done a masterly job of weaving their unique magic into an engrossing and thoroughly delightful documentary. Peter Paul and Mary truly are the minstrels of our age. The sadness at the death of Mary Travers and the pathos of Peter and Noel Paul resolving to carry it on is palpable. No longer young men, these two troubadours can still wow an audience with their impeccable musicianship. For anyone, such as myself, who grew up loving their music and even performing it it local folk groups, this is a DVD to watch, enjoy and treasure for ever.",1502064000,4,843,4.516339869281046

7334587,4,B011LV3GJI,"Peter, Paul and Mary was born in 1961, amid the artistic ferment of New York Citys Greenwich Village, and it was in that highly-charged atmosphere that their art sharpened into advocacy. Brought together by manager Albert Grossman, the trios debut album topped the chart in 1962, and led them to perform songs of social import at protests, strikes and political rallies around the world. They championed the early works of Bob Dylan, sang Blowin in the Wind at the 1963 March on Washington, endorsed Eugene McCarthys 1968 campaign with an original song, protested nuclear power at Diablo Canyon and documented the plight of El Salvador in the 1980s. They lived up to Mary Travers edict, ""if you're going it sing the music you have to live the music.

Though their hits ended with 1969s Leaving on a Jet Plane, and they started a seven-year hiatus in 1970, they regrouped in 1978 and continued to record and perform until Travers passing in 2009. Jim Browns 78-minute documentary focuses primarily on the salad years of 1961-70, capturing the groups deep conviction in live performance and interviews. The period footage, often in full-length songs, is incredibly moving as the trio sings with a strength of sentiment rarely seen on todays national stages. The way in which Mary Travers was physically gripped by the music remains enthralling to this day. Their folk music galvanized a broad international audience in ways nearly impossible with todays balkanized world of personalized streams. But in 1963, music was a rallying point that had wide societal impact.

Clips with Tom Paxton and Pete Seeger link to the broader folk and political milieus, and scenes from Mary Travers memorial service expand the program beyond Browns earlier&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carry-It-On-A-Musical-Legacy/dp/B0001GL03Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carry It On - A Musical Legacy</a>. The film sticks mainly to the trios public, performing side, leaving out the inner workings of how they wrote, developed their sound, toured or recorded. Also missing is Yarrows 1970 arrest and conviction and its impact on the group. Interviews with the trio, along with spouses, children and managers provide period color.
