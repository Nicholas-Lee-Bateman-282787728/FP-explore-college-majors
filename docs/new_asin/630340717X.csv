645556,4,630340717X,"This bawdy romp through the medieval French countryside is an ideal candidate for ""cult"" status. Colin Firth's 12th-Century yuppie lawyer is farmed out to Le Hicksville to plead the case of a pig. Contrary to what you might think, the courtroom scenes actually provide the most sobering moments in the film, reminding us of how frighteningly easy it is for humans to kowtow thier basic freedoms to superstition and dogma. It is Firth's interactions with the ""locals"" outside the courtroom that provide the most entertainment. Some memorable tete a tetes involving a chambermaid and a fiery Gypsy siren recall the 1963 classic ""Tom Jones"" at times. Wonderful supporting performances from the likes of Ian Holm and the late Donald Pleasence (playing the ""heavy"" as only he could) round off this unique, highly entertaining little sleeper. Note: I have NEVER seen this film referred to as ""Hour Of The Pig"" (outside of this listing)...it is always titled as ""The Advocate"" on cable and in video stores.",990057600,14,999,5.0606060606060606

Maybe if there were less babe-ish types, & more females that looked like Terry Jones in HOLY GRAIL or Leo McKern in HELP, we could have gotten behind this.",987292800,2,448,4.409638554216867
645668,5,630340717X,"This is one of my all time favourite movies.

Also known as ""The Hour of the Pig"", this 1993 film is timeless, fascinating, and very entertaining. Set during 15th century medieval times in France, it features a savvy, young, city lawyer Richard Courtois (Colin Firth), who leaves Paris for the simpler life in the country. He moves to the provincial hamlet of Abbeville in southern France to practice law as an advocate (public defender). The new advocate is initially out of his depth as he comes face to face with the bigotry and superstition of those times and how they are reflected in the laws of rural France.

Colin Firth leads an excellent cast of characters including Ian Holm, Nicol Williamson, Amina Annabi, Donald Pleasance, Michael Gough, and a variety of animals - yes, the animals have a focal part in the events and had similar legal rights as the humans. ""The Advocate"" is a study not only of the laws of the time but also the customs. These are depicted via parallel story lines that include child murders, the power of the local Seigneur, sex, corruption, witchcraft, gypsies, a pig, a donkey, rats, discrimination, and the plague. It is both shocking and hilarious to view the practice of law as it was then.

A fabulous movie for historical enlightenment and entertainment; it will remain with you for a long time after viewing it.",1368230400,,1352,4.769230769230769
645669,4,630340717X,"If you are interested in The strange, The True and The Law then this Movie is a Must See. It is based on the the life of a real lawyer in France and the strange judgments and the Laws in effect back when the mind of man was barely out of the dark ages and it was not that long ago. It gives a glimpse on how much our legal system is based on the Roman Legal system and their laws. The time period where this movie is set, the French Legal system had become a mixture of the exactness of Roman Law and Mid evil Superstition. It makes one wonder about our current legal system and some the laws in effect today.",1360022400,,609,3.959349593495935
645670,4,630340717X,"I recently saw the original uncut version of this movie, which is entitled ""The Hour of the Pig"". It's a drama, but not entirely so. It would also qualify as a black comedy. It's a quirky yet interesting bit of cinema. Extremely gritty in its depiction of what medieval France was like...nothing romantic here. Colin Firth plays a lawyer who is tired of the big city (Paris) and moves into a small town where he feels he can do some good. But he encounters more than he bargained for...political intrigue, murders (in the form of a serial killer), a few romps in bed and unusual court cases (hence the title of the movie). And a heads up to all Colin Firth fans...in the original version you get to see Mr. Firth in the buff. Yep...you do. Several times. That version has, quite frankly, a lot of nudity (full frontal for both sexes) and sexual activity. Like I said at the beginning of this review...gritty. In the original version, you have to pay attention or you might get lost in a couple of sub-plots. In any case be sure to see it through to the end.

Soon he must decide on defending a pig, owned by a mysterious woman Samira, the pig has been arrested for the murder of a young boy. Animals were tried in courts back in those days, though it sounds comical and has comic areas it is drama and has nudity hence the R rating.

645673,5,630340717X,"I've loved this movie for years, and am very happy to own it at last! Based upon a series of true stories, it is the tale of a Parisian attorney who relocates to the sticks, with his clerk in tow. The lawyer believes he'll find ""real"" people, rather than what he's used to in Paris. He quickly finds himself called upon to defend a pig (falsely) accused of the murder of a Jewish child. This film has it all -- love, lust, witchery, tomfoolery, sex, and politics. Stellar performances from Firth, Ian Holm, Donald Pleasence (one of his last appearances), Jim Carter, Amina Ammabi, Michael Gough, and Nicol Williamson.

The excellent performance by Colin Firth as an idealistic attorney looking for a simpler life in the country pulls the viewer into the not-so-simple lives of the peasantry and the nobility of the time.  Costumes, make-up and sets appear well researched and accurately presented.  A treat for the eyes and the mind, and a history-lovers' dream.",1301270400,,627,5.009615384615385

This movie takes place in the 15th century, when animals were actually tried in a court of law for alleged crimes, ie murder, sodomy, etc.  I liked this movie because it reminded me of how far we have evolved.  Or have we? I remembered what we still do to animals who are trained by humans to hurt others.  For the most part, we still blame the animals for their actions.

645698,4,630340717X,"Set in medieval times, The Advocate opens with the journey of idealistic new lawyer Richard Courtois from Paris to the southern French village of Abbeville, where he hopes to make a difference in the lives of the downtrodden peasants. In no time at all, he's overwhelmed by a backlog of cases the likes of which he has never encountered. When he finds that the majority involve animals accused of such crimes as bestiality and murder, Courtois simply cannot accept the absurdity of such a practice. But his attempts to reform the local system of justice are vigorously impeded by the corruption of the gentry.

This movie has much to recommend it, from the excellence of its cast, to the scrupulously rendered settings and costumes, to the factual underpinnings of its plot. Based loosely upon the life of medieval advocate Bartholomew Chassene, it achieves a pleasant balance between subtle comedy and drama, a commentary on the readiness of the powerful to capitalize upon the fears and superstitions of their day.

(Warning to those who find nudity offensive - there is quite a bit, both male and female, although the love scenes are not excessively graphic.)",1229817600,2,1162,4.984536082474227
645699,2,630340717X,"In the dark ages in France a young lawyer travels to a small village to be the Advocate, sort of like a public defender.  It's a time when people believe in witchcraft and demon possession in people and animals.  Thus, we see a donkey accused of being a party to beastiality, and a pig accused of murder, along with a host of witches, lunatics, and robbers.  The Advocate (played by Colin Firth) is a sort of medieval Perry Mason, coming up with clever defenses.

The village is supposed to be brimming with hidden secrets, but none of the secrets are very earth shattering.  They include a secret society that doesn't have any interesting secrets, a priest who chases women, a corrupt rich landowner, etc.  Nothing very interesting.

The scenery and sets are well done.  The casting director and the costume designer did a grand job of making the actors and extras look authentic.  So, it's a visually attractive movie.

There is quite a bit of nudity, which will doubtless thrill the Firth fans, but it's not sensual.  The sex scenes aren't steamy.

This was an okay movie to watch once, but I'm sorry I bought the DVD.  I donated it to the library, so some good came of it.",1228089600,5,1176,4.569377990430622

I love Ian Holm and he was a pleasure here. After I decided the movie was a spoof I enjoyed it more.

645704,3,630340717X,"This is a very uneven film, to say the least. I would like to discuss the storyline/plot; the humor; then the film making and editing; and finally the actors.

First, this is the story of a dark time in human history where theocracy and fear of witchcraft ruled the minds of common people while wealth was concentrated in the hands of a few. It was a time of anti-semitism; torture; poverty; plague; and injustice. Into this mix comes a handsome young lawyer, played by Colin Firth, who defends witches and homicidal pigs. He falls in love with a Jewish beauty who seemed more gypsy than Jew. The story appeared to be written by a committee who could not decide if they were writing historic fiction, social commentary, or slapstick comedy. Dark humor prior to executions gave the film a odd sense.

Second, this film was poorly edited. Scenes were cut short and I felt constantly jerked around by amaturish film editing.

Third, the cast was actually superb even if the rest of the film was weak. Colin Firth never overplayed his part. For Colin Firth fans, he appears nude in several scenes. Ian Holmes was very good as a corrupt priest who advises Firth. Donald Pleasence wins the award for highly professional acting in a poorly developed story. Pleasence plays a aged lawyer who outsmarts and outmaneuvers Colin Firth in the courtroom.

Idiotic story with good acting - gets a 3 in my book.",1149811200,10,1395,4.704918032786885
645705,5,630340717X,"A fascinating film that reminds us just how little has changed since the middle ages. This film could have easily been set in today's America, with it's take on ""values"", ""morality"" and other buzzwords, which are as eagerly used in today's ""justice"" system as they were then. If judges and Christians scare you as much as they scare me, you will enjoy this film.",1118793600,14,362,4.671875
645706,4,630340717X,"A friend pitched this movie to me as an uproarious Monty Python-like film about medieval lawyers. The Miramax marketing division tried instead to promote it as a sensual murder-mystery and courtroom thriller. (They failed, however, to mention that it's set in the Middle Ages.) The truth is somewhere in between -- yes, The Advocate is funny, but it's no thigh-slapper. Yes, it contains something of a murder-mystery (with a large black hog as its primary suspect) and courtroom drama, but it's not edge-of-your-seat suspense. Yes, it is sensual at times (so much so that cuts were required to keep an NC-17 rating off the film), but it's certainly no glossy romance. (Generally, the film's love scenes generate a vague worry that perhaps the participants should have a bath or something first.)

But all combined, the movie is a fascinating -- if somewhat surreal and sometimes startling -- movie experience.

The Advocate (also known as The Hour of the Pig) stars Colin Firth as Richard Courtois, a Paris defense attorney who seeks a quieter life in the country. He and his diligent clerk, Mathieu (Jim Carter), settle in the quiet-seeming hamlet of Abbeville, but the town isn't as quiet as Courtois had hoped. Also, he learns to his frustration, the law allows animals to be accused and tried with the same rights and privileges as humans. Thus, shortly after freeing a man who bludgeoned his wife's lover to death and failing to save an accused witch, the conscientious Courtois finds himself called upon to defend the aforementioned pig.

Believe it or not, the major plot points of the film, set in 1452, are based on historical records, culled from court transcripts and diaries of the day. The opening scene, where a man and his she-ass stand accused of carnal acts, sets the tone as nooses are placed around both convicts' necks. A last-minute reprieve does arrive in time to save the ass, however -- the court has determined that she was a victim, not a willing participant, and therefore may go free with no stain upon her.

This movie isn't for everyone, and certainly the pace will seem a little slow for those raised on typical Hollywood comedy fare, but nonetheless it is worth tracking down for a curious 110 minutes of medieval intrigue and wit.",1117756800,16,2263,4.87012987012987

The Advocate is an delicious medieval court drama that takes placein the days when humans and animals were both known to be hosts for the devil. Courtois, an educated lawyer (Colin Firth), runs from the big city to find peace in the countryside but, instead finds murderous acts holding the a village in fear. I won't give you more for fear of ruining the surprises, but the cast is peopled with dynamite performers like; Ian Holm , Donald Pleasence, Nicol Williamson & Michael Gough.

645791,4,630340717X,"""The Advocate"", written and directed by Leslie Megahey, is an underrated and overlooked film, masterful in its subtle insanity and brutally honest in its depiction of its characters and setting.
The time is 15th-century France, a time when animals were subject to the same civil laws and penalties as humans and could be tried in a court of law.  Parisian lawyer Richard Courtois (Colin Firth) and his clerk Mathieu (Jim Carter) arrive in a small rural province.  Courtois intends to enlighten the suprstitious and backwards populous, run by an unofficial leader (Nicol Williamson).  Courtois' skills are put to the test when he must defend a pig accused of murder.  That the pig belongs to a roving band of gypsies only complicates matters.  Mixed into the conflict is racism, accusations of witchcraft, political and religious corruption, and whispers of the Cathar heresy.
The movie is wonderfully acted, and the director is sure not to glorify or soften any of the characters.  Courtois may be intelligent, but he is also arrogant.  The priest (Ian Holm) may be enlightened, but he is also a womanizer.  The music and costumes are more period appropriate than most medeival fair, and many themes and signs of the times are apparent: the street preacher that accosts Courtois, the secrets of the Cathar heresy, and a particularly vivid Hieronymus Bosch-inspired nightmare.  While the film is ostensibly a drama, their is much bawdy, Canterbury Tales-style humor, enough to keep the film from collapsing under its own weight.
The film is finally available on DVD, and this may bring a new round of fans to it.  For myself, who had only ever seen it on video, seeing it in widescreen was a wonderful thing.  Be warned, however, the film has a very twisted plot, and multiple viewings may be required to sort it all out.  That's not even mentioning the twist ending, a moment of deliciously black irony.  Definitely a must for period film fans and certainly for anyone who loves quirky, slightly off-key dramas.",1060214400,141,2011,4.967164179104477

One of the great courtroom farces of all time.  Wonderful implicit satire on the eternal corruption of the justice system.  Oh, and there's bawdry in it too.  The twist at the end will jar you.

History fans might enjoy the before and after synopses of the characters and the historical figures on whom they were based. Colin Firth fans will definitely appreciate his bed and bath scenes, although his acting abilities take everything up a notch. Still, with the gratuitous nudity, modern feel, and slim production values, this film can't aspire above B-movie status.
The plot's a bit convoluted. The story is minimally narrated by Matthieu, the law clerk, yet he figures very little in it. Is the story about his boss--the advocate--or about the town? Maybe it's too ambitious in scope, what with its contrasting of country life and city life, interjections of witches, superstition, racism against Jews and gypsies, fornicating by the local clergy, secret societies of merchants, the Black Plague, unusual hunting prey, and sodomy. Oh, yes, then there's the trying of animals in court, a central theme that adds both humor and pathos to the proceedings and proves to be the unraveling of a dark and dirty secret hidden within the town walls. The ending's twist on the knight in shining armor is a good one.
The film's worth a viewing for some fine performances and relatively interesting Medieval subject matter. Just don't expect it to be high brow.",1004659200,92,1416,5.029787234042553
