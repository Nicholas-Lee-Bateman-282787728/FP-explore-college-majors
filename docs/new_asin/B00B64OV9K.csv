Each of the videos on the market do an excellent job of capturing the beauty and soul of fly fishing and have excellent shots of fish in their natural habitat.

What this movie adds is a playful plot and storyline, which has been lacking in the fly fishing genre.  Peter Christensen does an amazing job of capturing the true elements of fly fishing and explains through the reading of a fly fishing journal left the famous fly fisherman Lars Lenth why we fish.  The sentiments were elegantly captured.

I also appreciated the cinematography.  When the scenes are focused on Lars in his younger years the footage is pristine and amazingly well shot.  Then, when he switches to his travels with Rolf, they are realistic and jumpy.  This difference is a clever way of telling parallel story lines and helps move the film along.

Part way through the movie the focus shifts from fishing to finding Lars Lenth.  Though I missed the fishing footage I appreciated the turn in the story.  Lars Lenth is a truly accomplished icon and to see him portray himself in a humorous way was refreshing.  The addition of the Norwegian actor, comedian and fly fisherman Bard Tufte Johansen was an excellent touch.  He has a few brilliant quotes.

For me, the film was a reminder to pursue what you do with passion, but, don't loose the bigger picture of life.  We are reminded to not take ourselves too seriously and enjoy the details and quality of the things we do.  It is not about catching the biggest fish, or the most elusive fish, but, enjoying nature, time on the water and good friends.  This resonated with me.

I would recommend this video to those searching for the some amazing fly fishing footage, but, who also want more of an artistic plot and storyline.  If you are simply after great shots of large fish being caught there are perhaps better videos, but I truly appreciated the artistic elements of ""only the river knows"".",1407456000,2,2081,4.64931506849315
8563153,2,B00B64OV9K,"This film holds one's attention until the end.  I'm not going to ruin the ending for anyone, but I will say the plot holds a great amount of potential, and then the film turns silly and irrelevant, ruining any aspect of the zen of fishing that it first builds upon.  I'm not saying I don't like humor, or laughing at myself, but this film switches its emphasis far too late in the game, which causes the whole film to feel way off kilter and out of balance.  The fishing cinematography throughout is wonderful, but the mockery the film raises at the ending dampens the achievement of the cinematography.",1398556800,2,603,4.564814814814815
