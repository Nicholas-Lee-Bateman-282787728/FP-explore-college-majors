3756389,3,B001PQO2SO,"The DVD moves way too slow.  After a few tries, I walked away.
I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is starting to play the bass.",1398384000,,132,4.076923076923077
3756390,5,B001PQO2SO,This is a friendly dvd for beginners out there. You don't have to know how to read music since tabs are shown.  All scales are repeated at a slow pace which makes it easy to learn.  One of the best DVD's.,1388361600,,204,3.951219512195122
3756391,3,B001PQO2SO,"This dvd had many different scale types shown relatively rapidly. I felt it didn't spend time explaining in detail. It is great as an overview of the various types of scales, but lacks if you are looking, as I was, as a beginner.",1352073600,2,229,4.348837209302325
3756392,2,B001PQO2SO,"I think the bass, the instrument, should stand out more. During a lesson the instructor talks incessantly- over each note played. I would like to just hear the note. The talk could come before or after a run, not during. Picky, picky, picky.",1329350400,2,241,4.627906976744186
3756393,5,B001PQO2SO,As a beginner bassist I'm always looking for the most clear and precise instruction.  This DVD couldn't get any easier!  Step by step in slow and clear direction and then speed-ed up to get the full effect.  This covers the basic yet very important part of becoming a 360 bassist.  Great DVD to have in your repertoire of learning and practice material.,1322438400,5,353,4.645161290322581

3756395,5,B001PQO2SO,This is the best beginner scale instruction dvd that i've come across.  the instructor does a wonderful job of simplifying the content.  this should go under - so easy even a baby can do it.,1285545600,9,190,4.4
