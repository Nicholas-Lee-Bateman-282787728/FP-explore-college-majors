5966526,4,B00F3LV4FG,I love Pet Semetary and it was a better even a great purchase to have 2 as well. I love Stephen King movies especially around Halloween.,1396656000,,136,4.269230769230769
5966527,5,B00F3LV4FG,"There are few Stephen King film adaptations that really nail it (""Carrie"" is probably still the all-time champion), and thankfully,""Pet Semetary"" is one of them.  And by all calculations, we can thank Mary Lambert, the director, who has just enough panache to pull off the really scary with the really ridiculous and throw in some intentionally placed humor with some great cinematography that really shines through in this DVD.  And give the actors room to live and breath and stretch in all kind of ways.  I haven't had a chance to watch the extras (am I the only one who buys for the ""extras"" and never finds time to watch them?), but they sound promising.  ""Pet Semetary"" will seriously scare you by the end.  That's pretty much a promise and consider yourself warned.  ""Pet Semetary 2"" is really not that bad, and it may be my sick humor that I like it a little more than the first.  Maybe because it is such an underdog and that Mary Lambert ups the ante a bit in the horror with humor department. And there is some serious gore and strikingly surreal images.  The ending is pretty much shot in a haze of unreality and it is directors like Mary Lambert who can take all the elements given to them in making a movie and turn the mediocre into something memorable.  I may be over analyzing things, but I see more than enough Ken Russell and Nic Roeg influences in her work and that is no easy task.  If you can't tell, I've always admired Mary Lambert's work and thanks to her,  ""Pet Semetary"" and ""Pet Semetary 2"" succeed in each its own way.",1393632000,6,1547,4.469750889679715
5966528,5,B00F3LV4FG,Love these movies and so cool it came with both of them!,1483920000,,56,3.75
5966529,4,B00F3LV4FG,"CARRIE is probably King's best-selling Amazon flick, but, I like the under-appreciated ones... like SILVER BULLET; these two forgotten gems; and,
most of the TV-mini-series. The actors; direction; horror; humor and beautiful cinematography saves a film that COULD have been bad in another situation.
PET SEMETARY is the reason I bought this double feature.  It is TRULY scary!
PET SEMETARY 2 isn't too bad. I have an ODD sense of humour, and MIGHT've liked it even better than the first one. Since the same director over-
saw BOTH movies, I suppose if you love one movie you'll love the other. Then again, the opposite MIGHT be true if you don't have a warped sense
of humour [like I do].
I have a VERY understanding wife---we live an hour from THE Frankenstein Castle ruins cemetary---and WE, both, enjoy a good beer with an ODD movie.
Oh! I'll attach a few pix of the little wife [she's 5'5""] and ME... at our local cemetery (last Halloween). Did I mention this is a great Howl-o-ween double feature?
BUY IT!
It IS! Join us at THE cemetery!",1469923200,,1042,4.693989071038251
