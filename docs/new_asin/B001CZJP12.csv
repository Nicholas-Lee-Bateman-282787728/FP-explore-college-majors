8290508,1,B001CZJP12,I hate to say this. But this DVD is a huge waste of money. Its edited heavily. I'm not kidding. They try to hide the fact that Lee is drunk. Instead of saying drunken fist. They say loopy fist. And they call the sak'e he takes Elixer.... and to make it worse they remove the red from his cheeks to hide that he's drunk. Believe me your best off buying the UNCUT box set,1369353600,,369,4.0
