3881075,2,B0029U107G,Not very good - had trouble keeping my interest.  Only watched about 20 minutes.,1408838400,,80,4.714285714285714
3881076,2,B0029U107G,"I only watched the first 10 minutes.  I was interested that someone made a movie in the '50s about a woman who becomes a prostitute and tries to discourage her sister from following in her footsteps.  As far as I could tell there are no well-known actors or actresses in it, and the script seemed, well, not real high quality.  The acting was OK as far as the first ten minutes went, but not what I would call first-class.  I would rate it just a ""B"" movie.  Not much more I can give based on the first 10 minutes.  I guess my time is too valuable to spend more on this movie.",1389830400,,576,4.098214285714286
3881077,2,B0029U107G,"it was interesting to see the 1950's take on a brothel, but of course there's nothing juicy here.
it only left me thinking.... gee, if i was a young guy forced to have sex with decent looking rich cougars that showered me with expensive gifts while i lounged around the pool sipping a highball of whiskey, i'd be loving it - LoL
i guess its different for women. apparently they weren't much into it.
The film shows a half of a second of a pastie white 1950's tail and thats all. Bummer",1386806400,2,485,4.282608695652174

8358271,1,B0029U107G,This movie was made in the dark ages of film.  Very lame. We could only stand 10 minutes of this movie.,1463184000,,103,3.9047619047619047

8358275,4,B0029U107G,"Don't listen to the morons that don't watch the entire movie then think they can criticize it. Some only see 5 minutes then write a review. It's  not bad, it held my attention and I like happy endings well sort of happy in this one. Watch the entire movie and then write your own review.",1441497600,2,287,4.218181818181818

8358278,3,B0029U107G,"Young, innocent Nancy (Joy Reynolds) tires of dull, small town life, and heads for the big city. There, she meets up w/ her older sister, Paula (Lisa Rack) whom, at least in Nancy's eyes, is living the high life. Though Paula tries to dissuade her, Nancy sets out for an ""art"" studio, where a group of seedy, slimy men attempt to direct her ""modeling"" job. Soon, Nancy is sent to a club called ""The Colony"" -run by an even slimier man- for her new, higher-paying career. Unbeknownst to Nancy, ""The Colony"" is a different kind of club, full of still more slimy men! Trouble, violence, and heart-rending pathos ensue (sort of) when Nancy decides to leave. THE WILD AND THE WICKED (aka: FLESH MERCHANT) is another cheeezy, 1950s semi-exploitation movie, posing as a cautionary film. The good news is that it's not completely wretched. The bad news is that it's not all that exciting or entertaining either! Yepper, this is the type of ""naughty"" film that great-granddad used to sneak off to see! Only ""shocking"" if one is offended by a fleeting glimpse of female buttocks. Otherwise, TWATW is as tame as a neutered tomcat. Watch for the not-so-stimulating dance sequence for added terror!...",1411776000,4,1188,4.828431372549019
