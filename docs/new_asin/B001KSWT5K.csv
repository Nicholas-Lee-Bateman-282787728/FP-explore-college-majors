Although the production quality isn't the same as shows you find on network TV, the quality of the education and the resources provided are fantastic, and Georgie is a great teacher.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to learn to sew for the first time, and I'm glad I was able to get a copy!  I've learned a ton!",1452556800,,414,4.407894736842105

8316093,5,B001KSWT5K,"I have been searching for this type of product- a video class that I can follow on my own time and watch over and over again for techniques. This dvd is perfect for visual learners who want to learn to sew. You get four dvds, packed with video tutorials. Start at lesson 1, and continue through all the lessons to build skills. You also get a cd to print off a booklet of all lessons, carefully explained in a verbal format. It takes a little time to print off the booklet, but it is logically organized with shopping lists and needed items. The first few lessons start slowly, allowing you to gather sewing supplies and get to know your machine. Then you make a bunch of fun, useful projects. I try to make each project several times in order to get comfortable. Thus, everyone got satin pillowcases for Christmas. Tote bags are next- who's on my list? You also make a cute make-up bag, a glove pot-holder, a useful pincushion. All the skills are things you will use in the future to make your own projects. A zipper is a zipper, in a bag or on a skirt! The booklet also has a section in the back to make and post techniques, like clipped corners and French seams, so you can remember what those are. Georgie Melot is supposed to be working on a follow-up dvd, with more advanced techniques. I wish she would hurry. I want to smock. This product is perfect for the beginner, as it walks you through each step of the project. I am so happy with mine.",1258156800,23,1450,4.334558823529412
