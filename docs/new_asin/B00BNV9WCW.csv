5660401,4,B00BNV9WCW,"I was a bit surprised that 3 people did not like this film because it was remade with an African American cast. I enjoyed it for what it was, a film with some of my favorite actresses in one of my favorite movies. I think there was more emotional depth in this version that there was in the original. The film was updated with nods to the Iraq war and that healthy babies can be born to a diabetic mother. The only weak links I thought was the character Annelle and Sammy. I will always be fan of the Sally Field vehicle but I wholly suggest giving this one a chance.",1368489600,3,567,4.117117117117117
5660402,5,B00BNV9WCW,It is a great movie to watch today on Mother's Day. I will rent this again or buy it to watch several times.,1368316800,2,108,3.739130434782609
5660403,1,B00BNV9WCW,I do not see how this movie ever got made!!! It is not worth the money I spent on it!!! They take the original movie and hack and slash it to death!!! I can not figure out how queen latifah could even be apart of this crap!!! Just do yourself a favor and do not buy this crap!!!,1368230400,8,278,3.810344827586207
5660404,5,B00BNV9WCW,This is a really good movie. It's a tearjerker but I liked it. Never saw the original but I definitely like this version very touching movie.,1368144000,8,141,4.461538461538462
5660405,1,B00BNV9WCW,"""Steel Magnolias""  is a remake of the 1989 film of the same name.

Chronicling the lives of six Louisiana women who congregate at Truvy's Beauty Spot to gossip, confide in one another, and express their dreams and fears, this version features an African-American cast, which might have been interesting if director Kenny Leon had made something more of it than a nearly straight copy of the superior original.

The remake cast includes Queen Latifah, Phylicia Rashad, Alfre Woodard, Adepero Oduye, and Condola Rashad -- all very good, but failing to give the story a new slant or point of view.  It's a shame to see so much talent squandered in this undistinguished effort.

The DVD release contains no bonus extras.",1368057600,13,716,4.933333333333334
5660406,5,B00BNV9WCW,"I've seen the 1989 version of Steel Magnolias more times than I care to count. I know every line by heart.  My friends and I use lines from this movie as throw-away lines (e.g. ""I'm not crazy, I've just been in a bad mood for forty years"").  I've seen the stage play countless times, also, performed by local theatre groups to professional troupes.  I say that to emphasize what a fan I am of this story.  So, by happenstance when I was home sick and saw a promo for this remake while watching sitcom reruns on Lifetime I almost fell off the couch.

An All-Black remake of Steel Magnolias is such a perfect idea!  This version is updated but still holds true to its theme of friendships among women--a theme that crosses racial lines.  I, personally, found it a little more emotional especially the scenes with Shelby and M'Lynn after the former's kidney failure.

Kudos to Lifetime and this great cast for remaking this wonderful story.",1367971200,14,937,4.602409638554217
5660407,1,B00BNV9WCW,"With all due respect, I simply do not understand why this movie had to be remade at all, let alone be based around an all African American cast? What was the purpose of this, and what did it serve? Steel Magnolias (1989) is a true American classic film, that I can watch over and over again. Somethings should be left alone. What's that old saying, ""If it's not broken, don't fix it!""

This new film did serve up an ok cast, but our leads can't hold a candle to our original actress' from the original film. The dramatic scenes with Queen Latifah are almost hard to watch, and I mean that as a bad thing. Also, the actress playing our new ""Shelby"" was a total train wreck. I didn't care for her at all, and I found it very hard to feel sorry for her in her final moments on screen. This new ""remake"" felt uneven in a lot of different areas and didn't translate well to the small screen.

If you want to watch Steel Magnolias, watch the original film from 1989. That movie has an all star cast, and even served up an Oscar nominated performance by Julia Roberts as ""Shelby."" In my opinion, this movie should have never been remade. It mostly just makes me angry.

If this is a sign of what ""About Last Night..."" will be like and the Jay Z produced ""Annie"" remake.. maybe someone should quit while they're ahead..",1367280000,11,1311,4.321138211382114
5660408,1,B00BNV9WCW,"How embarrassing! This fine cast up against something no cast and crew could ever live up to. Queen Latifah poorly replaces Sally Field in the lead role, her dramatic finale doesn't hold a candle to the original which takes place in a graveyard not Truvy's Salon. Not gonna say there was no emotions there but it was far from the original. The young actress' that played the role originally played by Julia Roberts was a disaster. The rest of the women were all passable but not up to par with the brilliant actress' that own the roles from 1989's version. The men here were all ok considering no one cares about those roles, this is a women's film. It's easy to see why this film was only considered for Lifetime channel and not any theatrical release. Honestly this attempt is about as bad as a white version of The Color Purple would be. SKIP IT!",1367280000,9,849,4.483870967741935

5660415,5,B00BNV9WCW,I wanted to HATE this movie so bad.  I am a huge fan of the original.  I reluctantly watched it. They did an AMAZING job with it.  I think I cried even more on this version then the original.  They did a great job paying respects to the original. Even down to the baby's Halloween Costume.  The updates were very subtle. Example: Original: I haven't left the house without Lycra  Remake: I haven't left the house without Spanx  There was a lot more time between Shelby and her mom (Latifah).,1499644800,,491,4.388888888888889

5660421,3,B00BNV9WCW,"I have mixed feelings about this movie... the original movie is one of my all time favorite movies and i don't really care for remakes of movies to begin with. With that said... I love Queen Latifah, she is an amazing actress... while I found the acting in this movie very good, with the exception of a few characters, I find that they missed some very iconic and important parts of the movie... Such as:
-The Condoms on the car for the wedding
-The eggs being squished
-The whole original ending
-etc...
However the parts that were done were beautifully done, such as the classic orange juice diabetic scene in the salon, the announcement by drum(although he is one of the characters I personally feel wasn't potrayed well)",1490054400,2,724,4.6640625

Even if  I had viewed this television version of ""Steel Magnolias"" before the film I would have liked the film better and disliked this one. The role of ""Shelby"" played by Phylicia Rashad's daughter, Condola, wasn't well acted. I just felt who she was and what she was going through in the film wasn't convincing. This is one of her earliest acting roles, and she may have improved considerably since then.  To me, the best acting amongst all these actresses was done by Jill Scott who played ""Truvy"". I thought she was really good..the singer of the group ! The rest of the actresses were fair.  I don't know this actor's name, but I really didn't like whoever played the role ""Drum"" !",1462320000,,796,4.5524475524475525

5660445,1,B00BNV9WCW,Whose idea was this?  Don't get me wrong.  I like all of these ladies but this movie has got to go.  Why would you change to an African American cast to read the same exact lines that were written for the original movie?  That poor Shelby is twisting in her grave.  What a complete waste of celluloid.  Don't waste your money.  The original is a classic and didn't need tampering with.  I give this minus 10 stars!,1451433600,3,414,4.285714285714286

5660460,4,B00BNV9WCW,"This would have got five stars from me if it wasn't so RUSHED. The lines they say are so fast and certain parts that were in the original were completely cut out or they put two scenes in one. The acting was not near as good as it was in the original, not near as much emotion. It's a good watch, a good movie to rent from Redbox once in a while...but it is NOT near as good as the original. It would have been REALLY good if they wouldn't have rushed through it. Each scenes goes by much too fast, the wedding was rushed, the coma was rushed, all the important big scenes just flew right through. It even felt like they were rushing so much that they forgot stuff. In the original, they talk about the groom's cake in the salon, but in this version they don't mention it until its the wedding reception, it was thrown in randomly, like the director forgot and then remembered last minute. Plus things were totally made unclear with Sammy and Anelle. It was like, first they met, and then we don't really hear about him again until she's pregnant. At least in the original there were comical scenes between them and he was mentioned more. It had good humor, true to the original, good drama and I love Queen Latifiah but this was much too rushed...idk who directed it but whoever did rushed it and ruined it.",1428364800,,1308,4.321138211382114

The most obvious change is the racial make-up of the cast, but the heavy-hitters tapped for the roles were just as perfect as the original. At first, the refreshed dialogue was jarring -because I know every line from the original by heart - but by the end, I welcomed and thoroughly enjoyed the little changes. Example:

""That VCR alone is worth getting married""  is now ""That Playstation Vita.""  And when M'Lynn called Shelby a 'Bridezilla' I laughed out loud.

At the end, it was still the story that touched my soul; the relationships of friends and family. And yes, I had tears in my eyes more than once, as always. Absolutely recommended.",1397174400,2,871,4.818791946308725

5660514,2,B00BNV9WCW,"I don't think my issue with this movie was the casting, in fact I think the cast (especially Latifah and Woodard) played their roles beautifully, considering what they had to work with. I think the issue here was the writing and production. For some scenes, it just felt kind of awkward. I think with this kind of remake they should have not tried to recreate the original so closely, as it's difficult to live up to such an iconic movie with a dynamite cast. This version could have been just as good if they had just allowed the actresses to live up to their full potential, rather than mimic their predecessors. It's simple, Alfre Woodard is not Shirley Maclaine...so why expect her to be? She is a talented actress on her own (just check out the awards section of her wikipedia page!).

The only scene I thought was the most organic was Malynn's breakdown. I was wondering how they were going to do that scene, and I had pictured Queen Latifah doing a Sally Field type rant in the cemetery and cringing at the thought. However, I think she delivered it well, considering the robotic line delivery by almost every actor up to that point. I think it really comes down to the fact that this was a TV movie, and probably would have been much better given a theatrical film budget.

Worth watching if you're fond of the story. Otherwise, skip it.",1390694400,,1345,4.530864197530864
5660515,3,B00BNV9WCW,"I love Queen Latifah, but some classics just shouldn't be remade.

5660516,3,B00BNV9WCW,"Like I said, I really wanted to not like this movie but I couldn't help but to watch it again.  The first time I watched it I hated it simply because I like the first movie so much.  The second time I watched it, I like it a little bit more because I saw it for what it was.  It was not meant to be a remake of the first movie it was meant to be another side of it.  It wasn't a horrible movie like everyone that gave it a one start it deserves at least three because it does have an all-star cast and they did a wonderful job at portraying the well to do African-American southen women.  Some people said that they hated the Shelby character.  I liked her, she was fun and fresh.  I thought that the one who played Annelle was horrible and I felt that Alfee Woodard did a horrible job.  It gets 3 stars because it's not horrible but I think at times the actressess tried too hard to mimic the original characters that they were not and failed BUT the scenes that were added and not a total remake of the original were great scenes.  Therefore I think if this movie were rewritten even just a little then it could have been better.  So in short basically you have to watch this movie like you would do with any book that was made into a movie.  Picture the first movie as the book and then this as the movie.  It's not going to be the same, i've noticed that my friends that haven't seen the orginal movie liked this a lot more than the ones that saw the original.

but I took the chance... best chance ever! Didn't the origanal movie leave you wondering and questioning a little at times, like you were missing a few pieces to the puzzle? You got the general idea of the whole picture, but some areas you sort of guessed what was going on?
Like why couldn't she adopt? Health problems, unless you have a terminal
illness or degenerative illness, are not a huge hurdle for adoption. In fact, they give you knowledge and understanding to help a child who might have your problem, which would make you better parents! And what happened to her transplanted kidney?
These questions and many more little pieces are filled in so that at the end of the movie the puzzle was much more complete. I felt more hopeful, uplifted, I too could go on with them -  It is now a beautiful movie fully worthy of watching over and over !!",1382313600,,1059,4.487046632124352

So I have seen the original maybe 20 times.  It is unabashedly corny.  The actors are not afraid to go over the top with some frankly schticky lines.  I love that movie but do not think it is in any way a great movie.  But this review is about the remake.

It seems like the makers of this film identified some of the same weaknesses in the original as I did.  In particular, the remake fleshes out some of the male characters and gives them more of a voice.  Of course Steel Magnolias is the quintessential chick flick, but I don't think it is fair to cast a bunch of men and give them very little to do but make the occasional crude remark.  The men in the new version, particularly Jackson and Drum, are (at least sometimes) smart, caring, compassionate men who are not afraid to show their love for the women in their lives. They have real conversations.  They help their women.  It was an interesting choice to essentially remove Spud from the remake - his character was the most appealing male in the original.

I also like the treatment of some of the campier dialogue from the original.  It is toned down or removed entirely.  Dolly Parton, Shirley MacLaine, Olympia Dukakis are actresses who attack a bad joke with gusto.  Queen Latifah, Phylicia Rashad, Alfre Woodard approach their characters organically.  I was especially interested to see how Queen Latifah would handle M'Lynn's ""aria"" from the cemetery scene.  I found it to be very pleasing and quite possibly an improvement on the original.  Setting this speech in the beauty shop was smart.  M'Lynn is on her home turf, grieving but under control, grateful for the support of her friends but also acknowledging the need to deal with her issues alone.  I realize I have seen the Sally Field speech many times and am somewhat inured to its charms, but I was very moved by Latifah's delivery of that same speech.

I went back and forth a bit over the casting of Condola Rashad as Shelby.  She basically just delivers lines with little emotion.  I tried to think of it as a restrained interpretation, but it ends up being really not much of anything.  I'm sure it's tough to be compared to Julia Roberts, but I wish this remake had put up a more worthy candidate.  The remake ends with a highlight reel of Condola's performance, and unfortunately that is just a reminder of its weakness.

The ending - that's why I watch this movie at Easter time, because of the theme of rebirth and hope and moving on with some joy after tragedy.  The remake completely eliminates that scene and ends up being a bit of a downer.

All in all, it's an interesting interpretation of the original.  I am not one of those people who feel that there was absolutely no need for a remake of Steel Magnolias.  I think the remake is more accessible and realistic in some ways, also more modern.  It is definitely worthy of comparison to the original.",1370390400,12,3029,4.5724907063197024
5660560,1,B00BNV9WCW,"This Movie Should have NEVER BEEN REMADE, What was the use.  When someone remakes a classic They should make sure it doesn't end up a Horrible Train Wreck of a Failure [and that is exactly what happened here].  Where do I Start?  First, I redboxed this today hoping it would be good.  I don't know what I was Expecting when the Original had the ""Dream Cast"" to top all dream casts.  Sally Field, Dolly Parton, Julia Roberts, Shirley McClain, Darryl Hannah.  They played their Parts PERFECTLY, and Every Single Emotion was touched in one way or another, Unfortunately not a Single Emotion was touched in me while watching what I DID see of this one.  You Laughed so Hard, and you Cried so Deeply that you turned off the Original Movie feeling that you had been on one of the Greatest Rollercoaster Rides.  If you have seen the original then you know what I am talking about.  If you haven't seen it then you need to watch THAT ONE instead of this one.  There were so many things in the original that were Left out or not even mentioned AT ALL, and the stuff they left out was some of the BEST of the Original.  Some of the classic lines were changed in this one to come out of a Different Persons Mouth than the one that it BELONGED IN.  They changed the SETTING for one of the Biggest Scenes from the original.  M'Lynn's Breakdown is what I am talking about here.  Now usually I don't mind watching remakes, cause sometimes I find myself liking them as Much as the original, However This Remake only Pi**ed me off, cause it was SO BAD.  It had nothing at all to do with the cast they chose, but EVThing to do with how they DIDN'T even TRY to make it as GOOD as the original.  I Usually feel like I get my moneys Worth when I Redbox a Movie, But Today I will have to say this was the WORST WASTE of $1.20.  If you were a fan of the Original you won't want to waste your Time or Money on this one, Trust Me.  You will only feel as let down as I was.  Don't Say you weren't warned.",1370044800,11,1978,4.185185185185185

8571739,4,B00BNV9WCW,"Having done the play in high school and loving Dolly Parton movies, I knew I wanted to give this a shot. While it had its ups and downs, it didn't disappoint. Yes, some of it is different from the original movie- for one thing, the original was set in the '80's, so some of the references had to be dropped in this film since it was a modern remake. I did like the fact that they put that spin on some of the jokes. I also appreciated the scenes they added depicting more of the family moments. I loved that they moved the ending to the beauty shop, as it should have been.

With all that being said, there were some glaring mistakes that annoyed me. I will agree that Condola Rashad lacked feeling and was more of a robot in her delivery. It also bothered me that a lot of the movie was exactly the same as the original, from the delivery of the lines to the choice of framing shots to the flow of the story. I could have replaced a number of scenes with the original, and it would have been exactly the same movie! While they wanted to update it, they missed the opportunity to make more of it their own.

So , to sum up:
Pros- A strong female cast who clicks well and had great chemistry, family moments that enrich the storylines, and the same humor as the original.
Cons- The lack of expression in the female leads' face (reminded me a little of Kristen Stewart), the almost shot for shot plagiarism from the original film, and missing dialogue that explains some the story. Also, changes for the sake of changes that didn't need to be made (Why change the name of the dog?!?!)

All in all, I enjoyed my watch, and will put this next to my Dolly Parton copy with pride.",1523491200,,1674,4.241379310344827
