8163796,2,B000LR9Y2C,"Filmed by Rick Hunt in September and October 2000. 47 minutes. In Kathmandu a tour group visits the main tourist attractions, including Durbar Square and marketplace, Swayambhunath, the Kumari Palace, a rickshaw ride, a show by local dancers, Pashupatinath, Boudhanath, Durbar Square and Golden Temple in Patan, making and buying Pashmina shawls, and Bhaktapur.

This is a home video with shaky camera work, fast zooms, fast turns, and poor audio quality. You can even hear the camera man laughing and speaking under his breath. Put that aside, however, and it was not bad for a home movie. Swayambhunath and Pashupatinath were fairly well done with good filming and some good commentary by their tour guide. Durbar Square and Boudhanath did not feature as prominently as they should. The rickshaw ride through the chaotic streets was fun. The scene of local dancers entertaining them at dinner went on way too long.

They visited the nearby towns of Patan and Bhaktapur, with Patan's Durbar Square being a highlight.",1254182400,,1017,5.120481927710843
