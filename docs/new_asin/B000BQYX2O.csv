8091168,3,B000BQYX2O,"I really get into these old Mexican movies. This is one of the top artists, ever. Charro is the word they use when they talk about him.
This movie starts out with the exploits of the bandit, el Halcon. Negrete and his gang rob a big hacienda during a party. Then we meet Juan, a young caballero, sailing from Spain to the new world. After landing in New Orleans he meets a young lady from the hacienda I mentioned above. Juan resembles el Halcon, except for the hair-do. He decides to accompany her stage coach on the long trip home. Along the way he saves her from bandits. Later attemping to stop another robbery by el Halco he ends up in a sword fight with the bandit. They prick each other and the fight is a draw. El Halcon suddenly realizes that something very strange has happened. So goes the story and they know each other. When Juan gets the girl it looks bad, but in the end it is besos, abrazos y fin. The DVD is perfectly restored. I've never seen a better job. The Twins sing a duet that is perfectly shot. They are in the same frame and it looks like two Negretes. The songs never make the top 10 but the singing is great. They get their heritage figured out and avenge their poor mother. Juan rides off with the girl. A good story, very good acting and perfect restoration of the 60+ year old film.",1197590400,2,1314,4.26
