8155624,4,B000KC8JUQ,I have two of Muata Ashby's CDs for meditation and Adorations to Ra and HetHeru and also his Egyptian Yoga which I have had for a while so I decided to buy the DVD. I am very positive so it did affect me that the sound quality is in HD or close to it.  The most important is to learn the movements and free your mind.,1422835200,,317,3.803030303030303
