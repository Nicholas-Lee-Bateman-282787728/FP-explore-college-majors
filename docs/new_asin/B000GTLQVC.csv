2 different names still didn't help...

1) ACTING: Amazingly enough, the acting wasn't ALL that bad. Don't get me wrong; nobody in this flick will be writing that oscar speech anytime soon. But, it wasn't as horrendous as I thought it would be.

2) PRODUCTION: This movie reminded me of a bad Italian zombie flick from the late 1970's / early 1980's. The soundtrack was mediocre, the direction and the editing was choppy and messy, some continuity errors and I'm not sure if the director wanted me, as the viewer, to be confused to what was going on or what. There were just things that I had questions about that were never answered. 5 moons in the sky and no one is concerned? One good thing was that when the zombie action get going (almost 30 minutes into the movie), at least the people behind this movie had the sense to give us lots of blood and gore. And the zombie make up wasn't really all that bad, either.

3) THE ZOMBIES: These are the typical George Romero shamblers that we have all come to know and love. They do what zombies do best; kill and eat. How the zombies have to be ""killed"" was different from what we're used to. But overall, nothing really new here.

4) THE CAUSE: Evil mayan curse...or is it?

5) NUDITY: Lots of nudity, some of it seemed almost unnecessary.

Man! I just watched this and the memory of it is already fading. I have seen terrible zombie movies that I want to forget about and they still linger with me to this day. I have seen great zombies movies that I can remember enjoying so much, that those memories seem as if I had just watched them. This was just another disappointing entry into the zombie genre that we did not need. The only curse related to this movie will be if it stays in your memory and you can't forget that you ever watched it.

Released thru ACTION CAT Enetrtainment.
Starring David Heavener,Todd Bridges and Joe Estevez.
DA DE LOS MUERTOS, That's what hold this movie together.
Never thought someone could explain what that line meant to me,Heavener takes us on a journey of explaining ,""We need to let loved ones lie in peace"".
The make-up is great, The acting is mostly there. Todd Bridges is over the top as the comic aspect,with some interesting to say the least costume thoughts and under-used. Joe Estevez is really going that extra thespian mile, For once. David Heavener is getting away from his macho, I'M THE HERO shtick, And making us believe he has many colors.
The most eerie aspect is that it's a mayan family of zombies, Great poster art has a vivid depiction of the familia.
This film should do well for the fledgling ACTION CAT VOD !",1167177600,,892,4.798701298701299
