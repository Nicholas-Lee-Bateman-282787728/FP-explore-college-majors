8035241,5,B0002ZDPYQ,"I bought this set live and in person at hastings as a used set. I'm so addicted to it! I've had it the better part of 4 years and I use it in conjunction with other workouts. LOVE LOVE LOVE. I use the first DVD more than the rest b/c the first half is a great warm up, and the second segment a great cool down from any other workout; or just doing the two segments in succession is amazingly relaxing.  I don't care that its an older set, its the best one I've ever had!",1382486400,,470,3.8958333333333335

8035243,5,B0002ZDPYQ,This is a great collection especially for beginner to intermediate. I would recommend going to a live class to make sure you are doing the poses correctly but this is great for when you need to stay home.,1361232000,,204,4.394736842105263
8035244,3,B0002ZDPYQ,This is a good CD.  I did not keep it as it had nothing more to offer than others I have.,1238889600,,89,3.238095238095238
8035245,4,B0002ZDPYQ,"I bought this 3-DVD set for myself, and chose the set for it's range of workouts - basic, fat burning, and body sculpting. I've tried all of the workouts at least once. My favorite continues to be the second workout on the basic DVD,  as this one is easy to pick up after I haven't practiced in a while (which happens far too often!). My husband also enjoys this workout and we are trying to make it a more regular part of our exercise routine. The other two DVDs are also enjoyable, but they are far more challenging and I find I rarely feel up to the challenge.
If you are very new to yoga, it may be a while before you are ready for the more challenging fat burning and body sculpting workouts. Overall the set is very good, but you might consider buying separate DVDs that better fit your individual needs and ability.",1208908800,6,822,4.303225806451613
8035246,5,B0002ZDPYQ,"Please be aware that this set does not contain any new Yoga Zone DVD's! It consists of the previously issued Yoga Basic, Yoga Sculpting and Fat Burning. I wish Amazon had indicated this on their website. Fortunately I could cancel my order in time.

If I could give Amazon a rating on this item it would just be 1 star, although in general they are great. But this time I had to find the content information elsewhere.

The individual items I rate at 5 stars, as Yoga Zone is really a great program. I use it almost everyday to do my yoga.",1104278400,58,539,4.2745098039215685
