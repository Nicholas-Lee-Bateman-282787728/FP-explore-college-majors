2311472,5,B0009PW3U6,"It was filmed in beautiful le-aux-Moines, Morbihan, France. All the actors are quite impressive- even those with minor roles. Take away or add a character and it just wouldn't be the same. The film is based on 'The Seagull', a play in 4 acts by A. Chekhov. In the film, the final act invokes an 'art imitates life' theme that sublimates the tragic ending of the play in a novel way. On first viewing, the direction in this final act in the film seemed a bit contrived, but a subsequent viewing has me convinced that the director's choices - including a  minimal amount of dialog - reveal the characters brilliantly. All in all an enjoyable slice of life populated by very believable characters & a fine example of le cinema francais.",1248220800,10,733,4.595419847328245

8065192,5,B0009PW3U6,"Fascinating film from Claude Miller, loosely based on Chekhov's play The Seagull.  Solid performances, superb direction.  Fans of French ""Art House"" cinema will no doubt enjoy this film.  Ignore the 1 star reviews, when this film was released it enjoyed excellent reviews and won several awards on the festival circuit. It is an especially good choice for those interested in filmmaking, acting and literary adaptations.  Viewers interested in fast paced stories with endings neatly wrapped up in a bow Hollywood style, might need to watch this film with an open mind, but you'll be rewarded in he end as this is one of Miller's most optimistic, poetic films.",1479513600,,659,5.074074074074074

8065196,2,B0009PW3U6,"The description was radically misleading.  The fell in love with who later became a director with family was *Julien* not Brice who was the ""marriage of convenience"" producing Lili's stardom.  Allusions to a story about 'what didn't happen"" was not supported by the making of Julien's film ""The Disappearance"".  While the female lead was indeed a pretty girl, perhaps of the ""Bardot"" variety, that was about the only redeeming feature of this movie.",1471564800,,449,5.123287671232877
