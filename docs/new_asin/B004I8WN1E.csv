4384449,4,B004I8WN1E,Okay Ill say right off the bat the new voices are awesome I mean the cast has Clinken Colleen in it and for you all who do not know she is android 18 from Dragon Ball Z. I'll say I was a bit nervous about how they would do the english voices and translations but this one passed with flying color. A good buy all in all.,1324512000,2,320,3.791044776119403
4384450,4,B004I8WN1E,"This box set comes with a hard cover box, and a normal DVD case to protect the two DVDs the show is split on.  There is another cardboard box that comes with the box and inside the box is the art book.  It's not really worth listing, nothing impressive about the art book.  It has all the females in the same pose but different outfits.  Their normal outfit and a different one in the same pose.  Than a few group shots.  Like I said nothing new.

If your not a person that likes to keep their cases the way they are, than you can get ""Season 2"" of this anime and use the outside hard box as a holder for both seasons.  Which works out well, all you would have to do is take out the cardboard box slip that holds the art book and put ""Season 2"" next to ""Season 1"".

The anime is not censored.  It has all the fan service you can want and than some.

In a nut shell the show is pure fan service.  It has a developing story throughout, but fails to develop any real characters.  The characters it presents does a decent job at allowing you to connect and immerse yourself in the world, but once you are finish watching you will soon forget them.  This by no means it's not worth watching.  The show slightly fails at providing deep characters, but the funny situations they get into are what make it worthwhile.

Season one starts off with your main character trying to get into high school.  He has not been able to gain accesses to any real schools, but somehow he is able to gain entrance into a secret academy.  This is where the fun starts and you meet your second main character.  The show is about the two main characters love, and is mostly clich japans anime where the guy is weak and can never make up his mind.  What makes the show is the monsters and the situations, and the laughter you will have watching it, plus the fan service.  There is a lot of fan service, and this anime is not intended for children.  There is no nudity (From what I saw in the fan dubs), but nevertheless not for children.

Todd Haberkorn plays your main character, and he has done decent voice work before in anime such as ""One Piece"", ""Full Metal Alchemist"", and from where I know him the most ""Claymore"" he does a good job at getting the emotions of the character across to the audience.

The color is good on the DVDs not to much background issues. The transfers are well done.  No problems with picture.  Sound is well done as well, The 5.1 sound, sounds better than most anime so no complaints.

At times the characters voices can be annoying, but nothing to write home about.  The dub for this anime is well done, and worth watching.  If you do not like dubs, the subtitles are there and from what I have seen match up well to the fan dubs.

This is a good box set, nothing special about the cases are art book, but if you have been waiting to own the anime like I have than it's about time Funimation did this and it's worth owning.",1323129600,9,2927,4.231046931407942
4384451,4,B004I8WN1E,"PROS:

Character designs and backgrounds are detailed, colorful and bright.  Everything usually remains on model.

Character movement isn't the most fluid but it does its job well enough that it doesn't detract from the show much if at all.

Everybody in the dub cast gives a stellar performance.  The dub is accurate to the sub translation with some minor wording differences.

Episodes 10 and 13 are better animated than the rest of the season and have the best fight scenes in the series.

Manages to retain most of the core elements of manga chapters that were adapted.

Sometimes succeeds at being very emotional and intense.

The last two episodes present some original ideas that are genuinely good such as the interrogation scenes and the academy having more involvement than in the manga.

Main cast is very vibrant and likeable.  The protagonists receive a good amount of screen time.

Some of the minor characters appear more often than they did in the manga.

Successfully conveys the manga's theme of tolerance and friendship.

The vocal songs and both the opening and ending songs are great.

All the in-show vocal songs were translated into English and song by voice actor of the corresponding character.

Captures the comedic aspects of the manga perfectly.  There is lots of breaking the fourth wall jokes, slapstick, raunchy humor, and overdramatic situations and reactions.

Great packaging.  The chipboard box, amaray case, and discs have a matching beige and brown school motif.  Amaray case has interior artwork.

Limited edition art booklet is pretty neat.  Most of it features promotional images of the cast posing in their school clothes and different attire.

CONS AND YOUR MILEAGE MAY VARY:

Even though episode 9 is a highlight of the season animation wise, it is also the most inconsistent episode when it comes to characters remaining on model.

If you can't enjoy or look past fanservice and risqu humor very little of this show will appeal to you.

Often reuses the same gags.

One of the character's infatuation with another virtually disappears after her debut episode unlike in the manga.  It reappears in season two.

The majority of the fight scenes are short and one-sided.

The shift between the comedic and serious is sometimes gradual and other times rapid.

Some occasional recycled footage and animation shortcuts.

Far too short.  The first season only adapts 1/3 of part one of the manga.

The timeline of events is very different from the manga which results in several storyline changes and characters appearing much earlier.  It adapts chapters 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 18, 19, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 8, 9, and 10 in that order.  Also, there are few anime-only characters.  Some fans of the manga may feel the show takes far too many liberties.

Episodes 7, 9, and 10 are condensed versions of the original chapters.

A lot less bloody and sometimes more comedic in tone than the manga.

Even though the series has an ongoing story it might feel too episodic and repetitive for some viewers.

The non-vocal background music is fitting but ultimately forgettable.

The events that transpire between the end of episode 9 and before the start of episode 10 are never shown.  The viewer has to put two and two together.

The villains are one-dimensional and the protagonists sometimes come across as being too obsessed with their love interest.

Some instances where two characters are talking at once so the viewer has to put on subtitles in order to decipher what the other person said.

Students and faculty never seem to receive any disciplinary action despite constantly breaking school rules.

Extra features are extremely lacking in content.  There is no textless version of the opening song, no version two of the ending song, no production art, no Japanese promotional commercials, no interviews with voice actors, and no audio commentary.  The only thing available is the textless version of ending song version one and a few trailers for other anime.",1322956800,12,3996,4.972768532526475

4384469,5,B004I8WN1E,"- Synopsis: Our main character's lack of academic success has him enrolling in the only school that will accept him. Much to his chagrin, this school is far from ""normal"". Except for him, everybody in the school is a monster of some shape or form. If they find out his secret, he's a goner! Tune in to see how the whacky adventures of this young man plays out as he struggles to keep up with the girls, and his overwhelmingly eccentric circumstances.
===========================================================================================================

- Comments: Great amount of fan-service. Unfortunately no uncensored scenes, but plenty of teasing throughout. If you liked animes such as Monster Musume, Maken-Ki, you might like this one too. Some of the scenes are quite amusing as well. This anime is simple and doesn't really have any complicated plot. It is loaded with silly situations which helps with the entertainment value. It's an anime to just turn off your brain and enjoy. Great for laughs and smiles. It's a ""feel good"" anime with some guilty-pleasure involved.

- Analysis: Life is heavily about relationships. Whether one's bonds are large or small, it is without a doubt that just about everyone has a bond with another in some shape or form. Although most of the bonds the protagonist forge with aren't even human, that doesn't stop him from befriending or becoming intimate with them. Fortunately, he realizes at some point that there are many commonalities between humans and monsters. Not just differences.

- Conclusion: Overall, it's not a bad anime with waifus and fan-service. Simplistic and light-hearted. Quite inexpensive too. I'd say it was worth it for the simplicity and waifus.

- Features: English and Japanese audio with English subtitles. Includes 13 episodes on 2 DVDs with a run-time of about 5 hours. Rated TV-MA for sexual content and some fantasy violence.

Some women will surely like it, but mainly this is a male fantasy-fest, and although we find a young male surrounded by essentially monsters, they are all, in their normal human form, beautiful and shapely, and most men would risk the monsterdom to be chased after by a bevy of beauties like this.

It WAS pretty funny at times, but I can't understand why this title is given 5 stars. I really wanted to like it more.

 What happens in almost every episode is predictable and cliche. I've seen it before, just DONE BETTER. You can also tell not much money was spent on production.

It's really a wonderful story about a girl with 2 sides to her, her friends, and the guy who  will be her love interest. Lots of fan service, no doubt! But a great story at a monster high school, and how the various relationships develop. Supernatural/romance/fan service/drama/comedy/action.

4384576,5,B004I8WN1E,"first of all i watched the whole show online & i loved it so much  so i got the DVD

overall its a harem \ ecchi  with a school setting but with a bit of a Gothic touch with paranormal monsters & such

the cast is quite colorful , the main guy is tsukune a kid who got drafted to the monsters academy by mistake  - the lovely moka who is the main love interest to tsukune & is a speacial kind of vampire that has 2 personalty which i find alter strong moka sexy  -  kuromu  the ever so seductive succubus with a cheerful personalty  -  yukari  the adorable smart little witch  -  mizore the cool , calm , innocent  stalker which i find her cute .

as of this season i find it more serious and has a plot more than the 2nd season ( which im now watching  )  and each episodes involves tsukune  getting to know more about the school  and meeting new persons err .... monsters , lets not forget the FAN SERVICE that the show will provide to its viewer .

i loved the show and its cast  ,  tho i never got into the MANGA  yet people say its way!!!!! better so i will look for it in the future

this not a kids show but for an OTAKU  its more  suitable

give it a try it has its funny moments",1408665600,3,1187,3.8781512605042017

Has an interesting story line in the almost usual school setting. Plenty of laughs with an English dub that is well done. Don't recall what the extras were or if they contained nudity like is sometimes the case. I don't see why a teenager or even a tweener couldn't watch this.,1392508800,,438,4.395061728395062

In no time he has befriended a group of girls the only problem is each of them intends on becoming his girlfriend.

Season one... focuses on Tsukune and the girl's lives at Yokai academy and feels like a slice of life anime due to the season lacking an overarching narrative, but the season concludes with a great three part finale!

Season two... Tsukune and the girls are back at Yokai academy and a new student has a grudge against them. This season has an overarching narrative and concludes with another great three part finale!

The animation, characters, finales and English dub are amazing which is why this is one of my favorite animes!

Be warned that the series is not suitable for children due to all the fan service and if you're unfamiliar with the term then let me explain.

4384648,3,B004I8WN1E,"Clearly I did not get the memo informing me that this series was a comedy. For the most part I would say that I am fairly new to the anime genre of entertainment. Before watching this the only other animes I had seen were action packed sci-fi movies or tv series such as Ghost in The Shell, Akira, Appleseed, Elfen Lied, Canaan, etc. The description I had read (through another service provider) of the series was, well, non-descript, but I figured I'd give it a try anyway. I started watching the first episode and thought to myself, ""Wow, this is really stupid and very juvenile,"" so I gave the first episode the ol' college try and finally decided that there wasn't enough action for me to hold my attention. About a week or so later I had finished watching other animes, came across this again, and figured I'd give it a second chance. From the second episode and on the show started becoming a little more entertaining, but still lacking in the action dept. Not too long afterwards I noticed that the series was classified as a ""comedy"" which then made sense as to why, while it was mildly entertaining, it seemed to lack in epic battle sequences. In fairness, the two part episode where Ruby was introduced as a character only slightly redeemed the first season from its lack of action.

Once I realized this was a comedy I tried then to watch it as such, but I still couldn't get the humor. I don't know if the humor is lost in translation between the English and Japanese, or if there is a certain aspect of Japanese humor that I'm just not understanding. It's the same kind of feeling I get when I am watching a British comedy, like Monty Python for example, and I just sit there scratching my head trying to figure out when it's gonna start being funny. Overall it is mildly entertaining, and its main redeeming factor are the characters, their abilities, and their...ummm...well, assets, and breastets. The show also does a good job of giving each character enough character for them to have their own unique (and cute) personality. My favorite was the ice girl.",1366416000,2,2073,4.587601078167116

This is a top drawer anime, and is an absolute pleasure to watch. Comedy is spot-on, the characters are all well done and lovable, and the fan service is great too! (If you are one of those who complain about fan service then I have to wonder why you are interested in this type of anime in the first place.) If you like harem comedies it doesn't get much better than this! I understand the Manga gets quite a bit darker than the anime. I have yet to read the manga, but if that's true I gotta think I'll like the anime better. To me the series is perfect the way it is. Lighthearted and a laugh riot start to all-to-soon finish. My only complaint is that it could/should have had a third season.

On the way to his new school he meets a vampire girl named Moka. She's very self conscious from living in the human world through middle school. She quickly begins to cling to Tsukune. He also manages to attract a succubus named Kurumu, a snow woman named Mizore, and a little witch named Yukari. All 3 of these cute girls are all about him and fight like crazy people to win his affection. The problem he faces is his humanity. If he is discovered to be human he will be killed. The only other person that knows is Moka, but Moka is loving and loyal enough to keep his secret.

I almost want to call this a typical harem anime, but I don't see it that way. It's better. Even though it is in the harem genre it is better than almost all of the other harem style shows I've seen. It's definitely very enjoyable. It's probably a PG-13 show. Although the nudity is minimal, unlike the 2nd season, you can't go 10 seconds in this anime w/o getting a panty shot. There's nothing wrong with that though. There are a lot of great characters; it is also animated very well. This series is filled with lot's of laughs. It's lighthearted and fun. It is a good buy for most anime fans that don't mind a little bit of risque action.",1350518400,,1352,4.28125
4384690,5,B004I8WN1E,"I've watched my fair share (probably more) of anime series, and after a while I sort of fell out of love of them. Then, a buddy of mine and I were chatting about different series, and he mentioned this. Saying I hadn't seen it before, he offered me his copy of both seasons to watch. Needless to say, I just purchased copies of them for myself.

The series starts off with Tsukune Aono, an average (apparently below average) high school student who fails his entrance exams and his dad 'finds' an entrance ticket to Yokai Academy. Once there, Tsukune immediantly stumbles upon the other protagonist and his main love interest, Moka. Who turns out to be a vampire. Yeap. But here's the funny thing: from a guy who hates most vampire series, I loved this one.

Throughout the series, Tsukune befriends many other 'beings,' including a Succubus, a witch, and an ice maiden. Ah, young love.

Besides the expected love...square? Rectangle? Eh...Anyways, besides that, there's a lot of messages sent 'behind the scenes' that really catch on, such as bigotry, sexism, and even racism. Throughout the series, the message of 'let's just all be friends!' shines through, but not glaringly, as it is much more subtle than you'd expect.

The Positive:

-Interesting, well developed characterizations.

-The lead genuinely seems to care about the people around him, often going to great lengths to protect those he loves

-NO ONE IS PERFECT: All the characters share their flaws, but as they grow closer in their relationships to each other, their flaws begin to disappear, as they learn from each other.

-Some truly funny/witty moments that made me LOL (laugh) more than I would've expected.

-Some moderate fan service

The Negative:

-Does not stick true to the manga. Goes off and does it's own thing. Which is not bad if you haven't read the manga, and even if you have, it's true enough to it that you could still appreciate it.

-It does get a little hammy at times. However, this is countered by the aformentioned 'behind the scenes' messages being sent, and being very well written for an anime of it's kind.

-The end of every episode is usually very quick. However, the episodes with longer endings are really quite impressive to see.

All in all? Check out an episode or two on Netflix/Youtube. If you like what you see, I'd say go ahead and make the purchase!",1346803200,,2360,4.780788177339901

The only thing I do not understand is why the anime failed to include the art teacher, because she is the cause of both tskune being found out as a human by the safety commitee, and why Lilith's mirror was used, so I don't see why a big character would be left out. The dubbing is superb, no delays in mouth or sound, they did an excellent job matching the two. I like the extra comedy that the anime includes, little tidbits here and there not found in the manga. This really is a great job, I just hope the come out with a Capu 3, because it is so good, and there is so much more to include.",1344988800,,974,3.9744897959183674
4384702,4,B004I8WN1E,"I've seen the manga and the Anime (saw anime first) and so let me be frank either go read the manga or watch the anime not both, this is true of any series not just this one, because 99.9% of the time your going to be dissapointed.  I've watched this entire anime on netflix and I love it, I love harem anime's even if the formula is over used sometimes.

Here we have a Teenage boy who for reasons unknown ends up going to a school run by monsters for monsters, almost right off the bat he makes a friend and meets his primary love intrest: a cute and cheerful pink haired girl who turns out to be a vampire with multiple personality disorder (which actually adds to the humor) but in true harem anime fashion other girls soon begin to persue him, an ice woman (basically an ice spirit) a bisexual witch and a succubus all decide he is theirs and theirs alone.

Most of the series focuses on their day to day adventures at school, as short as it was you actually learn a decent amount about the primary characters and see the good and the bad in each of them. For me my biggest grip with this story was not knowing who to root for? The ice woman, the succubus or the vampire girl. (I left out the witch because she's only 12).

Minor warning, there is alot of sexual innuendo, nothing overtly pornographic, but very suggestive. Personally I have seen worse in this area but if your easily upset but this sort of thing I suggest you think over this anime carefully.

Overall: The animation style is very consistent throughout and the voice acting is decent enough, over all its a good story that is worth watching over and over. My final gripe is that it was too short, to me anyway.",1340755200,3,1683,4.313291139240507
4384703,4,B004I8WN1E,"The anime is certainly fun, and not a waste by any stretch, but if the triangles bug you, this one is especially frustrating.

The whimpering main boy character hooking up with the gentle, submissive girl is a granted in these, but in this one they make her the clear lead for no apparent reason, and you're assaulted by this strange choice every time a potential emotional moment comes up.  I always found myself asking ""Exactly why DOES he choose her?"".  She has no personality or quirks to identify her as anything other than a cardboard cutout going ""Oh Tsukune"" every few minutes.  The other girls have history, family, and personalities, and they're lots more fun.  But for some reason the main girl is constantly pushed as the clear front-runner.  His token dedication to her in the usual trials and choices is mystifying when the other characters are far more interesting and just as caring.

In summary: Loved the other characters, setting, and the silliness (Basically everything but the main characters).  The two lead characters and their 'romance' gives no reason to cheer them on, and was downright silly until the last ep. of season 2.",1339632000,,1150,4.861538461538461
4384704,5,B004I8WN1E,"I love this anime. It's nice to have quirky monsters of all sorts. But what I liked best, which kind of irks me with other adolescent love stories is that the two main characters are truly in love with each other and they know it. That doesn't stop everything else that goes on around them. I'm a sucker for true love, so I'm a sucker (yes she's a vampire) for this. Not to mention her kick butt alter ego. I wanted more, but only two seasons.",1334966400,9,443,4.162790697674419
4384705,5,B004I8WN1E,"I just got my copy of Season 1 and 2 and this is the best anime I've seen so far! I haven't read the mangas yet, but, I'll be looking foward to it! Can't wait for a Capu3!!!",1334534400,7,173,3.5789473684210527
4384706,5,B004I8WN1E,i bought this along with season two and got them both two days later with regular shipping and it was well protected i do agree its a little to pricy so i recommend seeing if u like it first on netflix but this is a must add to any dvd collection,1334188800,,246,3.843137254901961
4384707,3,B004I8WN1E,"I feel that this anime was pretty enjoyable. The first 5 to 6 shows was about introduction each of the main characters in this anime. It's pretty good until you realized that it's the same thing in each show. All it is, is Moka and Tsukune want to be together, but the problem is that there are so many other girls that want Tsukune too. Then add in a slight easy problem to fix in every show so that Moka can fix with her kick.

Moka solving the problem at the end of every show with a few kicks gets really boring fast.  She does ""kicks"" because those are her only moves because this is the only way the writers can show her pantis. If she punches people then you won't see her pantis, so she only kicks when she fights.

Fan service is great and all but there's just too much of it here. It just boring really fast. Their skirts are way too short. It's like they are not wearing anything sometimes because you are always shown from below skirt level to see them.

There nothing else to say about this anime because that's it. The whole first series is based on this.",1333756800,,1069,4.2
4384708,1,B004I8WN1E,"I got Rosario+Vampire Season 1 dvds...
If you love the manga as much as I do PLEASE don't ruin it for yourself by watching this.
It's just...bad. Bad animation, bad transition, screwed up sequence of events, cut out all the good plot and added a bunch of perverted scenes and dialogue that weren't even in the books. Waste of money and time. If you HAVE to see it, watch it on youtube. Please spread word. Thanks. <3 :/ *disappointed*
---For those who read the manga. Refer to this for specifics----
There are like...NO VAMPIRE AONO PARTS! Mizore comes in way too early. They completely skip Mizore's confrontation with the male teacher. They make her ice sculptures fight Moka on the ledge instead of Tsukune ever transitioning. Everytime Moke bites him they show a big ""kissie"" mark on a blacked out screen! They do this overly silly whispering ""Tsukune....Moka....Tsukune...Moka..."" thing EVERY EPISODE!T-T I'm so sad. I was looking forward to this! NOT FOR CHILDREN! They show more panties and boobs than plot. >< The poor plot...it never had a chance. Oh btw...Ruby fights them and calls the plants to kill them. Not her Lady. They did a nice job at animating both Mizore and Ruby, but everyone else seemed kinda cheezed up.",1332892800,3,1229,4.829383886255924
4384709,5,B004I8WN1E,I was a bit torn between the reviews but I went ahead and bought the first season.  I finished it today and found it funny and enjoyable.  It may not be for die hard anime fans but it was fun and upbeat.  If your looking for some bubble gum to watch over and over this is a great choice.  I already ordered season 2.  Lots of fan service and some harsh language but nothing that takes away from the show.  Not for the kids but cool for any older teens or adults.,1332374400,2,462,3.967391304347826
4384710,4,B004I8WN1E,"This anime took me by surprise.  I will admit that it uses the same old formula seen in other anime series...especially Harem anime.  Now I happen to like some of the Harem anime.  Tenchi Muyo was one of the first anime series I watched.  But that's besides the point.  Rosario + Vampire is about a human going to an academy meant for monsters;  Monsters such as Vampires, Succubi, Witches, etc.  Humans aren't accepted in the academy and humans can't even get to the academy because of a special  barrier that surrounds it.  Of course, Tsunkune Aono--a human--ends up going to the academy and makes some friends who are all monsters and who are all girls......and of course they want to get in his pants.  None of the characters are deep.  As I continued to watch the anime, I started to like it more and more. The climax to the first season was brilliant as was the ending to the second season.  Is it perfect?  I'd say no.  But I did like it.  I didn't read the magna so I can't say which is better.",1330819200,,1002,4.369565217391305
4384711,5,B004I8WN1E,Awsome an average guy thrust into a supernatural situation who comes out on top. I won't say any moreso I don't ruin it for every body. I think its instant classic material on par with Outlaw Star and others in my collection.,1328918400,2,225,4.380952380952381
4384712,4,B004I8WN1E,I bought this series because the manga was good.  The anime isn't as good but I really liked the animated characters and music.  It was flashy and fun.,1327622400,3,151,4.357142857142857
4384713,4,B004I8WN1E,"ROSARIO won't show you anything new but it's well drawn and some of the characters actually develop through the series and provide a nice balance.  It's not going to involve you like Naoki Urasawa's MONSTER (I'm still waiting to see how that one plays out) and some others do but it's a couple of evenings pleasant entertainment.  At some point, I'll watch it again.",1327622400,,366,4.703125
4384714,1,B004I8WN1E,"This is going to be a biased review but I feel that it needs to be posted. If you have read the manga, do not buy this! See it any other way if you want but don't waste your money. They took a decent story with good characters who had some depth and then watered it down to pure stupidity and tons of panty shots. Don't get me wrong, fan service is ok with me. Like I said the characters have lost their depth, the story does nothing to express the development of them and their feelings and it completely ignores some very important scenes/interactions that advance the lead. Reading the manga got me really looking forward to this because I thought potential was there. What a let down. Like I said, this is really a warning for those who have read the manga. I wish I would have noticed the one other review with one star by another person stating the same. But I missed it so now I am adding another one star review to hopefully help someone else from wasting their money. Now, if I try to think about this as a person who had not read the manga.... I still kinda think that it's meh probably three stars at best. There are better ecchi harem comedies out there in my opinion. The voicing for the characters felt off to me, the animation was good but sometimes I felt the background was weak. Music was decent. Like I said 3 stars at best. I still think that it deserves a view but don't think a purchase.",1327449600,6,1409,4.241635687732342

4384717,4,B004I8WN1E,"looking at past reviewers - i would have to agree with many of their opinions.  I preordered this and season two at the same time (though why did they release at the same time is a mystery to me) and was happy when I got it.  No damage and season two fits right into the box keeping them together.  but now to the review

Tskune is your average middle row joe.  but when the only school that would accept him is Yokai academy (which his father found an application on the street) is a dream come true.  But when it is discovered he is the only human in a school full of monsters, we really has  to watch his back.  But the good part he has some good friends to help him out, a vampire, a succubus, a snow fairy, and a under age witchling with a dream of a threesome.  The bad part is that all the other guys are jeaolus of him and girls fight over him, and Moka the vampire just seems to not resist sucking him dry.  Add that Mokas other side is a complete opposite of her and the teachers are all scary leads to a lot of misadventures.

The anime is more moe driven than the manga, with panty shots and near nudity but most of the key elements are there, Kurumu keeps smothering the hero with her large bosom, Mizore is the silent stalker, and Yuki keeps trying to get in the middle.  Some things they should not have used is using the chibi bat to give the fight times and also cutting certain things out, or postponing them until later (in the manga moka started giving Tskune blood during the Mizore episode with the gym teacher), someone siad the fights were one sided, but given that vampires are near the top of the power charts it is only expected, and also moka does not start running into trouble until later in the mangas anyway when the fights get more serious (the disciple squad leader for one and Ruby's mentor).  But using the bat as the monster id'er was good (better than a chart explaining what they are).  Overall the series was good, and i am getting into season two so I will see how they changed this one.",1327017600,2,2028,4.22020725388601

4384719,3,B004I8WN1E,This is a very funny series. Assuming one can see past all of the fan service. The fan service is almost overwhelming and at times very blunt and hard to see around. There isn't much for a story basses. Its overly short with out getting much done. As well as the romance that was big in the manga seems to almost fall to the way side here. Not enough put into it. A battle every episode and repeat explications wear one thin and dreading the next battle. One saving grace that this series is a small bat that appears from time to time with something half way witty to say. Manga is much better (but which one isn't better than its T.V./movie counterpart?). Buy for a good quick laugh. But not much else.,1326412800,2,703,4.293233082706767
