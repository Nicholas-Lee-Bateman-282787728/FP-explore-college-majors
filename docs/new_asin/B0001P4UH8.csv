I enjoy these old 1966 cartoons because they are the drawings done by such classic artists as Jack Kirby and Don Heck.  If you are a fan of Marvel Comics then these make awesome collectibles.  With their striking artwork, these clamshell cases will catch the eye of anyone who enters the room.  If you get a chance to get a copy that has been taken care of and you happen to have a working VCR then you could have yourself a wonderful afternoon.  Enjoy!
