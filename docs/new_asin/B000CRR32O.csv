2471383,4,B000CRR32O,"Seeing David Sutcliffe dancing with a cross dresser was worth it!!  I love him, and I love Heather Graham in this movie.  I'm only disappointed that I've only seen it on tv and don't own the actual movie.  I've taped it off my DVR, but am going to buy it, because I love it that much.  Her drunk looking for her bra after her friends wedding is priceless!",1186531200,2,355,4.176470588235294
2471384,3,B000CRR32O,"I am a Sandra Oh fan so I bought this movie because of her and Taye Diggs.

2471385,4,B000CRR32O,"Ok, so this movie is not going to be on any great movie lists, but I still enjoyed it. Sometimes you just need a movie where you don't need to think, you just watch and have fun. I liked the plot, and all of the actors (Heather Graham, David Sutcliffe, Taye Diggs, Sandra Oh) did a great job with their roles. A great chick flick for movie night!",1156118400,2,346,4.102941176470588
2471386,3,B000CRR32O,"Director Nisha Ganatra and writer Tassie Cameron seem to have most of their experience in TV movies so this little slice of the industry is a change for them.  Would that it were wholly successful because it seems as though both had a fine idea for something to say but just didn't know how to make it work. And again, blame the PR folks for making a cover for the DVD that not only seems silly, it has little to do with the story inside.

Pippa McGee (Heather Graham) is a travel writer, a hedonist, and an independent woman who avoids relationships like the plague.  The film starts with a goofus dash for a wedding in which she is once again a bridesmaid on the run.  After the ceremony she jokes with her best friend Lulu (Sandra Oh) who is equally against long term relationships beyond a quick shag, and she also meets one Ian (David Sutcliffe - Under the Tuscan Sun, Testosterone, Happy Endings etc), a handsome if shy young man who though attracted to Pippa, sees her as dangerous territory.

Pippa soon discovers that her father Malcolm McGee (Bruce Gray), a wealthy successful owner of a magazine conglomerate, is ill, has a heart attack, and though the father and daughter have had a negligible relationship, Pippa offers her help.  Of course, her assignment is to be editor of 'Wedding Bells' magazine her departed mother started, and Pippa takes on the epitome of everything she loathes about relationships and marriage and tries to make a go of it.  She discovers that Ian is her father's vice president and thus in charge of her new and loathed assignment.  Pippa partners with the handsome magazine photographer Hemingway Jones (Taye Diggs), has a fling, and becomes close friends and partners in an attempt to change the look of the wedding magazine.  There are far too many subplots to discuss, but suffice it to say that changes occur in the personalities of everyone involved and the ending, while entirely predictable, has enough humor and warmth to make a good evening out of a shaky story.

Heather Graham handles her 'challengingly bad' role with great aplomb: she is a delight to watch. The remainder of the cast does their best with the lines they're given. This is a bit of fluff, aimed at the 'chick flick' devotees, but it has its moments. Grady Harp, July 06",1151884800,10,2288,4.669154228855722
2471387,1,B000CRR32O,"What????  Sorry, but this movie had NO acting merit whatsoever to me.  Maybe it's because I like movies with a little more substance.  I saw it on tv and was glad I did not purchase it.  It just did not flow at all.  The characters were not believable in my opinion.",1150416000,,266,4.137254901960785
2471388,2,B000CRR32O,"The first half of the movie felt like a waste of time to watch because of the editing. It was like half the scenes had no beginning, they were just a middle and an end. I couldn't follow what was going on as it happened, I had to work it out afterwards, and some of the time I couldn't at all. It's not like there were a lot of complexities that were vital to the central plot, but I still want to understand details, as I assume there must be some point to them. The choppy editing is the overriding problem that makes me wish I never bothered with the movie.

As for what I could follow of the story, in the first half we're seemingly led to admire Pippa's independent spirit, then when we're invested in that character it's revealed as a symptom of her fear of intimacy.

We're supposed to believe that she has some kind of relationship with Taye Diggs' character, and be emotionally invested in the outcome, when he's had a total of like 1 minute of screen time, the first scene where they meet, and the second when she inexplicably shows up at his apartment, a typical example of the starting a scene in the middle thing I mentioned earlier.

The it's-happy-because-they're-together/it's-sad-because-they're-not-together moments were more forced, contextless and unearned than in the vast majority of romantic comedies, and completely at odds with the overall more vague tone of the film.

Maybe I just took too logical of an approach to a movie that is supposed to work on a primarily emotional level, but even the emotional wavelength on which the film attempts to draw you in doesn't seem to have much consistency. It's kinda like it started out as a Peaches song, then became Liz Phair, then finally became Dido.",1147219200,,1721,4.632786885245902
2471389,5,B000CRR32O,"Why didn't this movie open at a theater near me?  It's so much better than the other romantic comedies out there.  Heather Graham looks beautiful (as usual) and actually acts (shocking, I know), which is a true testament to the great skill of director Nisha Ganatra.  The supporting cast is FLAWLESS and even though the script is just sort of okay, the movie is WONDERFUL!  A great date movie, girls' night in movie, or anytime movie!  Buy it, rent it, do what you've got to do, but make sure you see it!",1143590400,6,504,4.434782608695652
2471390,5,B000CRR32O,"Phillippa ""Pippa"" McGee (Heather Graham) returns home to attend yet another wedding, and begins to wonder if all of her once boldly independent girlfriends will succumb to the comforts of coupledom. She's satisfied to know that her best friend Lulu (played deliciously by Sandra Oh) is still a cohort in their Sex-in-the-City type antics.  Then Pippa's father has a heart attack, and Pippa helps by taking over as editor for one of his magazines: Wedding Bells.

Pippa brings her personality to the job, and asks her confused new employees to push the status quo. Cheryl Hines and Bruce Gray play two of these characters -- and they are soooo funny. Also tied to this temporary new job is Ian Gray (played by David Sutcliffe), her father's uptight (and charming and handsome) VP. Ian doesn't want Pippa to destroy her ailing father's magazine, so he tries to rein in some of her crazier ideas. Of course the two butt heads.

And the two share an amazing chemistry.

I smile all the way through this movie, every time. If you like light-hearted romantic comedy, this DVD is well worth the cost.",1141603200,19,1093,4.767195767195767
2471391,5,B000CRR32O,"This is one of my favorite movies! Heather Graham is fantastic as Pippa, a free spirited travel writer who has a hard time committing to anything- especially men.

When she takes over her father's magazine, she meets Ian, played by the very talented and sexy David Sutcliffe. The two have great on-screen chemistry, and it's clear they will end up together in the end, but the unpredictable way in which they do is perfect.

But unlike many other romantic comedies, the movie has more going on than just the connection between the two main characters. The movie deals with Pippa's struggle to create a successful magazine, her feelings about remaining single while her friends around her are tying the knot, and the unresolved issues with her dad.

This is a great movie for anyone who enjoys a light, sweet, entertaining romantic comedy!",1141516800,8,838,4.887323943661972

The problem is that the movie gets muddled in building to a crescendo. So for the first half of the movie it is a great buildup with a lovable character. But from there it is just nonsensical twists and turns rather than a progression of the main plot to the climax.",1398816000,,448,4.209302325581396

That's the problem, the script is awful. A very dumb, silly, formula RomCom that I just couldn't get through. There is absolutely no chemistry between Ms Graham's character and the David Sutcliffe character.

2471425,4,B000CRR32O,"I enjoyed this straight to DVD comedy. Heather Graham is a darling neurotic heroine who is unaffected by her wealthy father who is some type of magazine publisher.  ""Wedding Belles"" is the one his daughter ""Pippa"" is going to edit.
David Sutcliffe is her romantic interest, and I cannot understand why he hasn't done more movies like this.....he's a cute guy.
This flick reminded me of The Wedding Date , The Wedding Planner, or 13 Going on Thirty. So if you enjoy light comedy you can watch with your daughter, then this is worth a view.",1393804800,,538,4.604166666666667

It has become my favorite movie of all time. The emotion and tension between the characters really draws a person in. If you want something fun and romantic, this has it.

Interesting if overdone story fails to fly. The visuals are there, the romance the X factor.. So why only two stars?
This movie was lost in the effort, I did not ever believe the chemistry between the two romantic leads. The great acting by Heather Graham, shocker, was saddled with dull plot and disjointed edit.

So she has to undergo some internal digging, with herself and a touch of soul scrubbing to heal her own issues and stand up to her Dad as well, who is a bit of a tyrant. She ends up falling into interest with her father's V.P. who is there to help guide through.
