5800776,4,B00DHDDE0A,"great movies, King Kong 33 is a B/W classic and King Kong 76 was very well done. Good ritual scenes with the islanders. Doesn't have the special effects of Peter Jackson's King Kong, but this movie was high-tech in 1976. King Kong is believable, but the snake he fights is a little bit hokey. Otherwise, both movies are awesome.",1386288000,15,328,4.576271186440678

5800805,4,B00DHDDE0A,Classic movies. It doesn't matter which version you prefer. It's amazing to see how far they've come from one movie making process to the other. But for me the characters Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lange portrayed were by far the easiest to connect with and that version is my favorite.,1485043200,2,284,4.7

5800823,5,B00DHDDE0A,Great movies. To be able to watch the 1933 version then the 1976 version lets people see the progression in Movie development. I was glad to have them both in one set.,1462060800,3,167,4.25

5800825,5,B00DHDDE0A,"I had not watched the '33 version since I was maybe 10. Back then it scared me to death, as did the '76 version. I watched them both the other night. I was surprised at how creepy and violent( as on people being chomped on) the '33 version was. I thought for sure once I viewed it I would think ""I can't believe how scared I was of this back in the day"" but I still see why it did. The special effects for that time were actually quite amazing. The '76 version is still good in my eyes. There were moments where Kong looked a bit cheesy, but the story was decent. These types of movies are for entertainment and these two deliver.",1460160000,6,630,4.088709677419355

5800839,4,B00DHDDE0A,can never beat one of the classics. The 76 version was close close to the old one but you can never best the  33 version.  I give it 4 stars for the 33 version the 76 was not bad but for the price and getting the remake it was good.,1457481600,3,232,3.62
5800840,5,B00DHDDE0A,Great movies. The '76 one introduces Jessica Lange.,1457222400,,51,5.5
5800841,3,B00DHDDE0A,"The original ""King Kong"" is considered an American classic.  A movie company travels to a remote island to film a picture, and they encounter the mysterious monster Kong, who is in fact a giant ape.  Fay Wray plays the leading lady who gets captured by Kong, and a young Bruce Cabot plays her gallant rescuer.  Though the special effects are primitive by today's standards, the movie is well-written, fast-paced, and exciting.  The climactic scene on top of the Empire State Building is perhaps one of the most memorable sights in cinema history.

Forward to the 1976 version.  It has better special effects and prettier scenery than the original, but apart from that it's a first-class stinker.  It was obviously influenced by the environmental politics of the 1970's.  That's why the exploration is carried out by an oil company instead of a movie company, and King Kong is shown to be the victim instead of the villain.  It's too preachy, the plot lacks believability, and much of it is just plain dull.  I've not seen the latest version of ""King Kong"" so I can't comment on it, but if you have a choice between these two versions, stick with the original.",1456617600,,1159,4.75

5800861,4,B00DHDDE0A,"Fascinating to see the evolution of Kong with each film produced roughly 40 and 30 years apart (although 2005 version isn't on this disk).  I bought specifically for the '76 version.  Jessica Lange is gorgeous in her debut and most of the effects are clearly more advanced than the original with the exception of the fight with the giant snake (they would have been better served to ask the original effects crew to do it in stop motion).  Also, quite bittersweet seeing him climb the twin towers.",1424390400,16,497,4.689655172413793
