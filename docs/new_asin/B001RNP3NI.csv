8338333,2,B001RNP3NI,"This vampire film has everything, and that is it's biggest failing.

It has sexy vampires preying on topless beach babes. There's a plot to 'breed' vampires by injecting kidnapped women with modified vampire semen! Some of the offspring however are 'mutants', but the girls are expected to breast-feed them. The girls are injected, anywhere, it doesn't seem to matter by a vampire carrying a very very big syringe.

There's a stalker outside a sorority house armed with garden shears, peering in on the girls who just happen to sit around topless. The girls all watch a film rental that's apparently cursed - all the people watching it die (ever heard that plot in a film before). Then there's the film itself so we have a film-within-a-film ploy. The film is of course a vampire film too. I think its Vampire Sorority House.

Then, and this is new, the chief vampire wants to convert humans into vampires through watching a film! So then we have Virtual Reality motiffs being piled in as well. This includes a vampiress who gets a woman hot by strapping electric wires around her leg.

There's certainly a fair amount of topless ladies in this. A few go compeletly naked.

There's just so many elements in this film to make one confusing mess.",1247443200,3,1244,4.7407407407407405
