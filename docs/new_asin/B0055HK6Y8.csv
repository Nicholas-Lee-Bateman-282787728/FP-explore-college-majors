4578002,5,B0055HK6Y8,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my sister who is in love with everything Christmas and if it were up to her, it would be Christmas every freaking day. She loved it. And it's a great price for all three.",1365206400,,208,3.9761904761904763
4578003,5,B0055HK6Y8,I have not opened this product as of yet but I viewed it on TV and liked it so much that I bought it.  I have never seen or heard of the Christmas in Boston one so will have to watch that soon.  I absolutely adored Snowglobe,1360886400,2,224,3.74468085106383
4578004,4,B0055HK6Y8,I liked this dvd. It was a family dvd and a family would definitely enjoy it. Good for all ages.,1360886400,,96,3.85
4578005,5,B0055HK6Y8,"Got this one for the wife. Yeah ABC Family can be sort of cheese, but overall these movies aren't bad. And it's nice to be able to snuggle up on the couch to watch something that isn't ""A Christmas Story""",1357171200,,204,4.125
4578006,5,B0055HK6Y8,I bought these for our Christmas enjoymen and we really have enjoyed them.  It was everything I expected at a price I could afford and the service was great  I have really enjoyed them. Thank you,1355702400,,195,4.388888888888889
4578007,4,B0055HK6Y8,The price I paid for three Christmas movies was great.  Christmas in Boston was very romantic.  This was my favorite movie.  Santa Baby 2 was ok but I liked the original one better.  Snowglobe was cute.  It was different to see your life differently through your own eyes.,1349654400,,272,4.583333333333333
4578008,3,B0055HK6Y8,"I purchased this DVD because I love the movies, but the quality of the picture was terrible! The video looked grainy, I couldn't get the picture to adjust to the screen right, and the colors were off. It was definitely not HD quality like I am used to seeing on ABC Family. I played them on my brand new blu-ray player which has played other DVDs just fine, so I don't think the quality was because of the player I used. I was disappointed with the DVD and think it was cheaply made.",1346544000,,483,4.204301075268817
4578009,4,B0055HK6Y8,"All three of these movies were fun to watch, but of the three, I thought ""Christmas in Boston"" was the best.",1346284800,,108,4.190476190476191
4578011,5,B0055HK6Y8,Love the mivie,1481673600,,14,4.0
4578012,5,B0055HK6Y8,"In all honesty, I only bought this because of Snowglobe because it is my favorite Christmas movie of all time.  I had looked on other lists and saw them selling this for $5 for just Snowglobe and came across this for $7 and I just thought it would be better to get an additional 2 movies for a few bucks more.
I think the only downside to this is that there is Santa Baby 2, but I have not seen the first movie so I am not sure if I would be confused watching the second one without having seen the first.
The quality of the movies are superb, for the price they are, it actually looks great.  It's not really grainy, I watch it on my Xbox 360 and it looks really  nice.",1480118400,,670,3.985074626865672

4578019,3,B0055HK6Y8,Christmas in Boston is not a G rated movie as advertised in the description!  My 11 year old daughter turned it off and said this inappropriate for kids.  Santa baby and snow globe are more like TV PG.  Snow Globe is the better of the 3 movies.,1449446400,,244,4.148936170212766
4578020,2,B0055HK6Y8,Love these movies when they used to be on Netflix and ABC family. These DVD transfers are awful...picture quality is just plain bad.,1448236800,,132,4.782608695652174

4578036,5,B0055HK6Y8,"I love sappy Christmas movies, and this one is no exception.  The storyline is pretty predictable, and as usual has a happy ending.  If you're looking for award-winning acting, then I'm afraid you'll be disappointment.  This is just a feel good movie where you find yourself rooting for the couple to live happily ever after.",1418860800,,325,4.872727272727273
