7965718,4,B000069I03,"I liked this movie "" Guns of The Civil War "" because it furnished me with some facts about armament Of the armies that I seemed to have overlooked or forgotten about. I also liked it because of the photography showing the details of the weaponry involved. My favorites were the Henry and Spencer Rifles. These two weapons I feel, helped usher in the era of modern war fare along with the Gatling gun.",1361232000,,400,4.418918918918919
