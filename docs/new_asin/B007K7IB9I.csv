5092109,5,B007K7IB9I,"I had the unsubtitles Swedish releases, and the first American release- which I was disappointed in because the deletion of background material in the compilation.

This new release is AWESOME!!!!

A must have for Arn fans and those of Kingdom of Heaven!",1339632000,41,254,5.023809523809524
5092110,5,B007K7IB9I,"At long last,after the travesty of the heavily edited 139 minute film,and the issue,in Europe at least,of the 'Extended Edition'200 minute version,we have the 265 minute TV series.
Having now had the opportunity to view the,region free,Blu-Ray 2 disc set,I have to say it has been well worth the wait.
The picture quality,despite the Aspect Ratio being altered from the original 2.35:1 to 1.78:1,and sound quality are excellent.
I don't propose to go into the plot details,as these will be well known from reviews on the earlier released disc.
The 265 minute series is divided into 6 episodes which are used to excellent effect to not only detail the logical progression of the lives of Arn,and Cecilia,but also provide depth to other strands of the storyline.
The extra run time provides greater depth to ancilliary characters,and to their portrayal by the uniformly excellent supporting cast.
Cecilia is played by Sofia Helin who is so superb as Saga Noren in the thoroughly recommended series 'Broen'('The Bridge').
Joakim Natterqvist is excellent as Arn.
The director,Peter Flinth is to be commended for this full length version which sustains the viewer's attention throughout.
All credit to the Cinematogapher,Eric Kress,to Tuomas Kantilinen for his original music score,and last,but not least,to Hans Gunnarsson for a really intelligent screenplay which does justice to the novels of Jan Guillou.
This full length version is definitely the one to buy,and is thoroughly recommended.",1338768000,160,1488,5.363247863247863

5092150,4,B007K7IB9I,"I came in with fairly low expectations; just hoping for a fun historical fiction medieval flick. But this mini-series has pretty decent acting and a well wrought storyline. I cared for the characters very much as the series went on. It was also interesting to see the fall of Jerusalem from another perspective; although it does some politically correct pandering and historical fact bleaching at the end (which is par for the course for cinema like this and Kingdom of Heaven, which I was kind of comparing it too since it covered a lot of the same events).

I would totally recommend this, but watch the series since the condensed movie version cuts out too much.",1492560000,2,665,4.732758620689655

5092168,5,B007K7IB9I,"Themes of love, faith, courage and family are masterfully woven in this tale of the Swedish lad Arn Magnusson who we follow from the time of his miraculous healing as a young boy through his return  home from the Crusades. Though primarily a love story, this epic tale is set in the 12th century, a time when Europe embraced the ideals of the Christian faith and the Knights Templar were its defenders.  Courage and integrity are the time honored trademarks of a noble man.  Arn Magnusson is that man.

The war scenes were incredible with the number of extras and there is a beautiful love theme throughout between Arn and Cecelia.  The use of different languages depending on the scene was very effective and with English subtitles throughout you have no problems following the storyline.  The musical score was great.

5092233,4,B007K7IB9I,"Swedish made for TV miniseries, based on a trilogy of novels by some guy named Jan Guillou. I've never heard of the books till I saw the DVDs. Apparently quite popular in Europe.

Not very big budget. But as one of the better-known (over there) actors said, ""Hollywood would, of course, spend ten times as much but not come up with ten times better."" And he was right on that! The cinematography was excellent, the directing likewise, the acting very good all around. Even the script was mostly endurable to good. There are a few very powerfully constructed moments and the rest of it is very watchable.

I thought that the casting was of superior quality.

The armor and scenes are excellent. The hero can RIDE! And when he charges on that warhorse with couched lance, it looks deadly as anything. The archers pull their bows realistically and competently. The whole crew took chances that you don't usually see in combat scenes in American films. I saw arrows dropping around the fleeing horsemen. I could have sworn that ""they"" shot horses dead through the neck in that last battle, but it must have been CGI. Holy crap! The clash of arms and bodies was very fierce. I'm sure that stuntmen and animals were injured in the making of this film. It looked that to me, anyway.

Plot: simple, two-part, ongoing throughout. The politics and characters in the Holy Land were simplified in the extreme, but it worked as a movie, it held together nicely, with time taken up for dramatic effect instead of trying to fit in too much historical data and characters. With a few reenactors and horses, they succeeded in creating a feel of massed ranks.

Clich&eacute; story-telling, of course. The hero gets his girl, she gets her man, in spite of all the odds. Tragic ending, not unexpected, because it too is clich&eacute;. But it is well done clich&eacute;!

This ""review"" is very late, because I only get around to seeing a few things, usually long after they are released.",1452643200,2,1966,4.717201166180758
5092234,5,B007K7IB9I,"For those of Swedish descent, this DVD should be must viewing.  With great attention to detail, the political intrigues and general way of life are portrayed throughout with great believability.  Rarely a dull moment.  Based on historical fact - back in the days when family-based neighborhoods passed as ""kingdoms"" - more than one viewing (along with reading some of the relevant biographies) may be necessary in order to appreciate the character interactions and the wide scope of the drama.  Arn may be the central figure in the story, but keep your eye on Birgir Brosa, historically a great peacemaker among disparate factions in Scandinavia.  ""Brosa"" may mean ""smiling"" but ""frustrated"" became his attitude as the intrigues escalated.  According to history, civil wars immediately broke out upon his death in the early 1200s.

My only real quibble with the series concerned the identification of Birger Jarl (the eventual founder of a unified Sweden) as Arn's grandson at the end of the series.  Having traced two lines of generations in my own ancestry to the two older, non-fictional brothers in the film, Birger Brosa and Magnus (both surnamed Bengtsson), Arn Magnusson would have been a brother (albeit fictional) to Magnus' son Eskil Magnusson.  Magnus' second wife, the legendary Ingrid Ylva (only mentioned in passing in the film), was the mother of Birger Jarl (surnamed Magnusson) who would then be Arn's half-brother.  Perhaps the technical matter of these relationships may still be unclear, although Wikipedia and other sources consistently indicate Birger Jarl as a nephew of Birger Brosa.

I have just a minor question (not a quibble, really) about the languages.  I understand that modern versions of the relevant languages were used along with (thankfully) good English subtitles, but I was a bit surprised to see the occasional speaking of English.  There was an English language at the time, and I was wondering if it had some use as a second language in other parts of the world.  It's a relatively minor point, and the subtitles are so excellent.  Those with hearing difficulties would still get the gist of the story.",1452297600,2,2143,5.117816091954023

I suppose I had very high expectations. Even though I disagree with the peculiar political message (think macho guys with an attitude who think like SJWs), I found the novels interesting, to the point of fascinating. Guillou is a good writer and skillfully weaves together fiction and fact, perhaps a bit too skillfully. The story is a rad-lib fantasy about a dissident Templar who befriends Saladin and civilizes medieval Sweden with the help of Muslims. But, as I said, I don't think the TV series lived up to the expectations some of us had around here. However, since I don't wish to start a culture war in the middle of the night (local time), I give Arn three stars. God wills it!",1443830400,,859,4.657894736842105

Great casting, beautiful scenery and a solid storyline only begin to describe it. Stellan Skarsgard, as always, was rock-solid in a major supporting role (I hesitate to call it a ""supporting"" role because he commanded every scene he appeared in). Joakim Natterqvist was fabulous, as were most others.

The DVD keeps the original 6-part story in place, which is great because it gives you several well-placed opportunities to stretch and rest the eyes, which is really important because (if like me) otherwise you'll be riveted from start to finish.

English (SDH) captioning is a life-saver, but I enjoyed hearing the other languages spoken in their various settings.

Once the boy is grown, he is released from the monastery, falls in love, and begins an adventure that will eventually take him to Jerusalem for the crusades. If you like medieval combat, love stories, and adventures then you'll LOVE this series. Specifically, if you enjoyed ""Kingdom of Heaven"" (but got tired of how much it relied on Orlando Bloom brooding), you'll LOVE this series. Kingdom of Heaven borrowed a lot of plot from the book on which this is based.

If you are into templars and Crusaders, you will enjoy this series, only if you have nothing better to do.
If you are into Templars and The Crusaders, watch ""Kingdom of Heavens, Directors cut"" instead.  No other movie of this genre comes close.

5092423,5,B007K7IB9I,"The Knight Templar (The Complete Series) is a spectacular epic based on the Crusades trilogy written by Swedish author and journalist, Jan Guillou. It features the fictional character, Arn Magnusson, a young Swedish nobleman, who becomes a Knight Templar as penance for having had a love affair with the maiden Cecilia. Cecilia is in turn sequestered in a monastery for twenty years of long penance, throughout which she remains loyal and devoted to Arn.

During this time, Arn becomes a great warrior in the Holy Land, participating in many historical events with true historical characters. The complete series, a 6-part DVD miniseries, is a fabulous, epic saga masterpiece. The time sequence spans approximately the same time as ""The Kingdom of Heaven"" film, which I have also reviewed. This is a tumultuous period after the Second Crusade, encompassing the fall of Jerusalem to the Saracens, and up to the commencement of the Third Crusade.

After Arn returns to his homeland in Gotaland, Sweden, he is forced to defend his clan against the contentions of a rival to the Swedish throne, a rival king who is supported by the Danish monarchy. A civil war ensues....

The DVD cover describes the plot accurately and succinctly: ""In a land of brave knights, powerful queens and treacherous kings, Arn Magnusson, a skilled swordsman, is sent off to war as a Knight Templar as a penance for his sins. Separated from his love true love by a jealous nobleman, Arn must battle a cruel and violent world to survive."" I recommend this series to adventure as well as  fans of romance with historical inclinations.

5092427,5,B007K7IB9I,"I am a huge Knights Templar fan. Before watching this movie i believed Ivanhoe was the best Knights movies ever. Well... I just changed my mind. This movie just showed me it is the best ever. And most of the time it is spoken in Sweedish (with english subtitles). But that does not matter. The story is just great. Looks like the Sweedish showed Holywood how to make a great Knights movie. If you love Templar Knights i strongly recommend you buy this DVD. Be aware that there are 2 versions. One with the full version (2 movies divided into 6 episodes of about 45 minutes each) and one version with a condensed version. Make sure you get the whole series. Again, GREAT MOVIE EVER.

5092449,5,B007K7IB9I,"I stumbled across this treasure of a historical film while combing through the generally dismal pickings on Netflix.  Wow!  This is a movie you can savor; spun out thoughtfully, without pandering to sensationalism or sacrificing authenticity for the sake of gratifying modern sensibilities.  ""Arn"" is a film where the story arises from character, and the characters are full-realized humans.  Unlike most stories that might make that claim, however, ""Arn"" is driven by characters I could care about, who strive to learn from their mistakes and who genuinely care about the morality of their choices.  This film is what a historical film should be, in my opinion.

The film is subtitled, as some reviewers have mentioned with chagrin. If you haven't the patience for reading subtitles, then be warned. For myself,  I found that I forgot I was reading subtitles, almost before the first scene ended.  The flavor of the film would be less, I think, without the cadence and color of the various languages spoken throughout.  An English-dub track rarely does justice to the delivery of the original actors, in my opinion, but with this film, dubbing would do violence to its beautifully textured historical tapestry of sight and sound, and I'm glad the producers made the choice for subtitles.",1388361600,3,1288,5.095238095238095

The DVD Series was a reasonable reflection of the books that I read, bearing in mind that it is always difficult for the film producer/director to encompass all of the written word. However, as I said, a good job was done for the viewer. The only drawback was that the DVD was primarily in Swedish and one had to rely on the English sub titles significantly.

I didn't want to stop watching even though as the series progressed I began to have serious doubts as to where it was going.

The excellent beginning episodes quickly fritter away into the drawn-out purgatories of Arn and Cecelia's separate existence, though there are battles large and small on both fields that keep things from getting dull. But ultimately I was left with a disturbing sense of pointlessness and the suspicion that perhaps my time would have been better spent elsewhere.

5092501,5,B007K7IB9I,"Based on the well-written Crusades trilogy by Jan Guillou, a respected Swedish author and journalist, Arn, the Knight Templar focuses on the life and exploits of one Arn Magnusson, a Swedish nobleman born into the Folkung dynasty during the Crusading era.  A tale of love and loss, betrayal, redemption, overwhelming triumph and utter defeat- I found myself unable to put these books down once I'd started reading.  Mind you, the writing style and dialog can be a bit offputting until you take into account that the characters in the novels do not speak English as we know it, it isn't their first language and their habits and customs, while similar to most Europeans of the time- you get the impression that you've been given an insider's look into a culture much like our own once you get past all the trappings.  I wonder if the author had a political message in mind when he wrote these books, but I digress.

The author obviously did his research with regard to arms, armor, accoutrements, tactics as well as the complicated political arena of the day- a lot of people will draw parallels between this film and Ridley Scott's Kingdom of Heaven although I must say, the attention to detail is what makes this the better movie.  As is usually the case with a film adaptation of a series of books, you can't include everything- but the producers were savvy enough to not take out anything that would ruin the cohesive nature of the story.  Keep in mind that I am writing about the Complete Series, not the chopped and formed version that came to the U.S. some years back- as with Kingdom of Heaven, the theatrical version was cut to conform to running time specs and as such, suffered greatly from the pieces that were lacking.  This series was adapted from the original Swedish epics and is as complete as you'll find- consider it the Director's Cut if you will.

In my opinion, this is the best 'Templar' film I've seen to date, and one of the best medieval epics I've seen thus far.  If you have any interest in anything medieval, or just love a good rousing saga, this is a MUST SEE.  I encourage anyone who has seen the film and liked it, to read the books as well- they provide a more indepth look into the characters and their motivations that may not be easily identified by anyone who hasn't already read them and is viewing the movie for the first time.  I've read the books through twice so far- and I've seen this movie at least three times.  It is a favorite and once this collection came available, I jumped right on it.",1372118400,67,2537,4.5516483516483515

5092504,4,B007K7IB9I,"I'm not only a fan of the medieval period, but a student as well... enough to know not to get your history from movies!  The bottom line is that this series (much, much better than the movie) is absolutely excellent and fun to watch, very similar to Kingdom of Heaven.  If you're like me, and loved the director's cut of Kingdom of Heaven, then you'll also love this movie.  The production quality, acting, scenery, costumes, etc etc. is great.

Lots of other reviews have addressed the language issue; to me, I think it was very neat that there are 3-4 different languages portrayed... it's a much more realistic approach to the medieval world, especially one spanning from Norway to the Holy Land.  There are tons of subtitles, so if you're one of those folks who can't handle that prepare for disappointment.  But if you're OK with it, the movie is a great experience, as the sounds of the different languages intertwine and become a fascinating vehicle in which to explore the period.

This series is a great story well told.  The story and production itself is worthy of five stars; the only reason I gave it four was because of a small technical detail with the blu ray that annoyed me far beyond what it should: when I first watched this on Netflix, the subtitles were used for every language but English, and then translated the language only.  For some very bothersome reason, when you set it to subtitles for blu ray it not only subtitles the spoken English into, well, English, but it's more like closed caption than subtitles.  Subtitles I can handle, and even welcome, but closed caption is very distracting.  It's bad enough to have to read English words when you can hear English, but to also have to put up with things like ""[whinnie of horses]"" and ""[sound of army marching]"" when I can hear them just fine gets very old very quick.  Perhaps I'm simply mistaken and there's a setting somewhere I'm missing.  However, as I said, this is a technical detail with the disc/medium and not a reflection on the production qualities of the movie.",1370908800,2,2055,4.659279778393352
5092505,5,B007K7IB9I,"This movie is based on my favorite trilogy, and now, seeing it in its entirety, I love it.  I watched the two hour version when it was first released, with the subtitles only in Arabic (I was stationed in Iraq at the time). And even though I could only understand short parts where English was spoken, like when Arn was in the Holy Land, I still managed to partially follow the story.  At least enough so that I bought and read the books.  Two years later it was released in the US with English subtitles.  I picked it up the day it was released.  But after having read the books a realized a lot of the story was missing.  It was still good.  Like I said, I watch in Arabic my first time and was captivated, even though I didn't understand what was being said for most of it.

Fast Forward to now, the entire miniseries was released in English.  I re-watched it.  Now, almost all of the blank spaces are filled in.  There are still a few places that were modified, and some that were left out, but most of the complete trilogy is there, and definitely worth watching.

5092506,5,B007K7IB9I,"Me: Oh, Netflix, how I love thee...
My readers: Can you elaborate?
Me: Yes, I can! Just read on!

  In a time of brave knights, powerful queens and treacherous kings, Arn, a skilled swordsman, is sent to war as a Knight Templar, while Cecilia, the love of his life, is imprisoned in a convent.
  Recently, thanks to the recommendation of a friend of mine, I discovered a wondrous, magnificent show on Netflix. This show is beautifully titled Arn: The Knight Templar.  >>>>>>
  Upon watching the first episode, I was captured. Oh, my, how this show has so enraptured me I could watch it over and over. Not to mention the awesome cover! >>>>>>>>>>>>>
  Such beautiful landscapes, characters, and plots, it's next to impossible for this show not to draw one in!
  This is actually the first foreign show that I've ever watched, it being Swedish. Ninety percent of the time, the viewer is reading subtitles. However, this does not detract from the visualization. If anything it enhances it, for it allows the dialogue to remain with you for some time.
  Now to the nitty-gritty.

  Language - very mild language used infrequently; ""h*ll"", ""cr*p""; one use of the s-word at the end of the series. 3/5
  Sexual content - a woman comes to a man and enters his bed, she begins to force herself on him, though this lasts momentarily. No nudity is shown. A man and a woman have sex (nothing but a man's torso and a woman's shoulders is shown) and it is said later that the woman is pregnant. A man is excommunicated for allegedly committing adultery with two women; a woman is sent to a convent for being with a man outside of marriage. 3/5
  Violence - Mild. Severed hands, heads, etc... A horse is slain. 2/5
  Scary Images - ^^^ 2/5

  All things considered, Arn: The Knight templar is a must see for any lovers of foreign medieval dramas who aren't afraid of a little love or a little blood. And who can forget the cover? :D

I was extremely amazed.  The acting was wonderful, all of them, the scenery amazing and the storyline was out of this world.
It actually deserves more than five stars.  If you like Medieval/history stories then you will definately love this one.  It is by no means a history lesson, but is based on true facts about the life of one man, so if you expect for this to go into detail about the Knights Templar or the Crussades, you might be slightly disappointed.

5092511,5,B007K7IB9I,"This is really an amazing mini series about growing up in Sweden under clan and religous rule. It has subtitles which some people may not be fond of, but to me and my son they were not an issue at all. If anything the subtitles really made it clear that people did speak numerous languages and that there were numerous cultures interacting together in positive and negative ways. The storyline is very good and the plot very interesting. When the mini-series ended on these DVD's both me and my son wished that this went on for numerous years the storyline was so strong and riveting. We were so enthralled by this series I immediately went out and bought all 3 books the series was based upon. Further we were so eager to learn more about the Templar's that I purchased 3 or 4 other books about them. The acting was fantastic in this series and the character development was very rich and detailed. I wish someone would entertain making the next generation of Arn going to the point where his grandson or great-grandson united all of Sweden's clans anf became King of the whole country. Definately make sure you get the true FULL complete series as there is another version that is edited to half the play time. This is the proper and FULL version of Arn. I wish I had got the blue ray version and may just yet and re-watch it. I highly recommend this series.",1365379200,13,1360,4.487903225806452
5092512,2,B007K7IB9I,"So from the descriptions I was led to believe I had purchased the uncut swedish version of this film.  Instead what I got was a combination of two films cut into half.  the first part is pretty good -- it tells a good story and the acting is reasonably compelling (some very good actors in the cast), esp the young woman who plays Cecilie.  Nice settings also.  But in the second part it just became AND THEN AND THEN AND THEN with very little explanation of how the plot fitted together.

So in my judgment you are far better off reading the original ARN trilogy by Jean Guillou, which is finally available in English.  That is a really fine example of historical fiction set in the early middle ages.  Fans of that type of historical novel will enjoy the story and the off-beat setting (medieval Sweden).",1362182400,3,806,4.47945205479452
5092513,5,B007K7IB9I,"Wow, what a great movie/series. Mini-series would seem to be the appropriate term. I can't believe I'd never heard of it before. Thank you Amazon for having such an extensive collection! Usually I just ignore their suggestions. Sure glad I didn't this time.

This little Scandanavian gem blew me away with its storyline, acting and cinematography. I love it when a movie is both entertaining and educational. After watching it I had to hit wikipedia and learn more about the subject matter because it was so interesting. Arn of course is a fictional character used to tell the story while actual history unfolds around him.

Anyway, the story begins in 12th century Sweden with our hero Arn as a boy. We see dynastic feuding between his clan (the Folkung) and the evil Sverkers amid the snowy Swedish landscape. We follow him as he learns both the spiritual and martial arts. He finds love, then has it taken from him. As penance he travels to the Holy Land where he becomes a respected and feared Knight Templar. He protects the pilgrims and fights the Arabs. Then he comes back home to fight injustice and reclaim his love.

This is obviously just a short summary that does no justice to the story. Its got everything: battles, love, loss, redemption and Swedish! Its such a fun language to listen to. Subtitles are provided for those of us who don't speak it. This was a big budget undertaking for the Swedish film industry, and I think it outdoes anything Hollywood has made for a long time in this genre. If you enjoy crusader/medieval films you will love this one, and will learn many things about this period of Swedish history(I know I did).

I have had the two-hour American-release movie for some time now and have always liked it quite a lot, however I was aware that a lot of information was missing and/or glossed over. It was frustrating not to be able to know what I was missing.

Watching this full series double-DVD was wonderful, like finally scratching an itch that you just couldn't ever reach. I like the way more of the minor characters are given time to develop, it makes the full film more satisfying. Especially interesting to me is the secondary character of the Norwegian Templar Harald ysteinsson, and his relationship to Arn Magnusson. Harald scarcely exists in the condensed American film version, but is well-developed in this full series version.

The only complaint I have is that toward the end it is shown that a bunch of Arabs came back to Sweden with Arn following his time as a Templar in the Holy Land. This is a serious historically inaccurate flaw. This would never have happened (Arabs living in Sweden in the 1100s). It smacks of having politically correct token Arab characters shoe-horned into the plot in order to make nice with the growing Arab population in modern Sweden. It was stupid, and it detracts from the overall presentation.

Sort of like when Morgan Freeman was cast in Robin Hood. I like Morgan Freeman, but it was simply historically inaccurate. There weren't any black people in the British Isles back then.",1355788800,6,1610,4.742857142857143
5092523,5,B007K7IB9I,"I originaly bought the shorter version, which I thought was good. I then read the books and realized how bad the movie was. This longer version is so worth the extra couple bucks; it really does justice to the novels and even if you didn't read them, you'll appreciate the story even better.",1353715200,,291,4.509433962264151
5092524,3,B007K7IB9I,"I purchase the Item but I did not know it would not be in english language, it was in dutch. But it does have subtitles in english language so i just have to read it through and watch their mouths move. it is a good movie overall. B+",1353196800,2,233,3.875
5092525,5,B007K7IB9I,"This is a great series on DVD. It is a love story, strengthened by lots of action about the Crusades in the Holy land. It also tells a story about loyality to ones family and country. I highly recommend it. The seller is reliable, and recommended",1352764800,,246,4.369565217391305
5092526,5,B007K7IB9I,"History fans of the crusades will enjoy this series. Great battle scenes, excellent character development, and a moving love story. It follows Arn's adventures as a youth and his training with monks, to his service as a Templar Knight in the Holy Land. Finally returning home, you witness Arn's struggle to defend his family and country (Sweden) from an invading Danish army. Spectular photography. The dialogue is a little confusing; depending on which character is speaking, the language is Swedish, French and Arabic, with subtitles, and then English. It is several hours long. I started, intending to watch one or two episodes at a time, but ended up in a marathon watching the entire series at once. I recommend you add this to your movie library. This series movie is very entertaining and engrossing.",1352073600,5,807,5.029850746268656
5092527,4,B007K7IB9I,I was pleasantly surprised by this movie... Extremely entertaining and well done.  Theh characters were well acted and the plot held my attention.  The entire family can watch the movie and enjoy the content and history of the first king of Sweeden.,1350604800,2,249,4.904761904761905
5092528,3,B007K7IB9I,"For what it is its okay, the story suffers because of the obviously low budget and they could have done some more research on the Knights Templar, the battle scenes lacked the epic quality I was hoping for again for budgetary reasons.

5092550,5,B007K7IB9I,"I always enjoyed the ""movie"" but the complete series is such an improvement.  The story is now much more coherent.  Some of the scenes that aren't in the ""movie"" are very powerful and important to understanding Arn and Cecilia and the overall arc.  The series is also more true to the original books.",1346889600,2,300,4.622641509433962

5092552,5,B007K7IB9I,"I first saw Arn as the heavily edited release that consolidated the four hours of the original series down to less than two hours. Still even in that form the true nature of the work was able to come out.
  This is a film about love, loss and eventual redemption. It does a good job of explaining the hold that the medieval church had over it's adherents. Arn is sent to the holy land for some twenty years to serve with the Knights Templars while the love of his life is interned in a convent. They serve their respective sentences and at long last are finally reunited only to find that their trials our not quite over.
 Amazon has the complete series with extras on Blue-Ray for only twenty-one dollars. Great buy for a great film experience. Highly recommended.",1342569600,4,765,4.489208633093525
5092553,5,B007K7IB9I,"This movie is better than BRAVEHEART (I thought Braveheart was great) and as good as GLADIATOR. Great plot, great costumes, great storyline, great acting, great costumes. The theme is the development of a unified throne in SWEDEN. This is one of those movies that come out every 5 years that stun the viewer into saying WOW!",1342310400,4,324,4.803571428571429
5092554,5,B007K7IB9I,"I've waited something like 5 years for the full-length version to come out in the U.S!  This excellent film is the REAL story fictionalized in ""Kingdom of Heaven,"" but continues as Arn returns and helps to shape the nation we now call Sweden.  This is ""Game of Thrones"" stuff, set in the real world!

I assume the one-star review next to all the 5-stars is by someone whose tastes run more toward Quentin Tarantino.  To each his own.  If the plot is predictable, it's because it's been used in so many films before; but this film tells the historical version.",1342224000,7,559,4.55
5092555,5,B007K7IB9I,"I bought this drama series, expecting to actually know more about Sweden, a country which was known more for its harsh Northern winters and IKEA more than anything else, and ended up buying the novel series on which it was based(Jan Guillou's Crusades trilogy) on my Kindle device after having watched this series. The series was by far among the most engaging of the medieval-themed dramas which I have watched up to date, although I am somewhat hesitant to say if the history on the count of the Eriksson family and Folkungs as captured inside the narrative is as accurate.

Swashbuckling action, romance, and travels to various exotic lands are vital elements of every Knight Templar narrative, and I believe that this series has fulfilled all of these requirements, while maintaining our interest in Sweden and its medieval history. I definitely recommend this series. Incidentally, I found out that there is a shorter movie version of this series, but the movie version is probably way less scant in its background details concerning characters.",1341273600,2,1050,5.069364161849711
5092556,5,B007K7IB9I,"Much better then the movie, glad I ran into this while I was scanning amazon. I saw the movie a year or so ago on Netflix, but it doesn't compare to the series and plan to order the books soon as well.",1340668800,59,201,3.8095238095238093
5092557,5,B007K7IB9I,"This version is much, much better than the first butchered DVD that was released in the U.S. last year, with over two hours of additional footage. Entire plot lines and characters are more fully developed than in the original American release. This film and Ridley Scott's Kingdom of Heaven are probably the best historical dramas dealing with the Crusades. Buy it.",1340496000,2,365,5.0

8518661,5,B007K7IB9I,"Not one to give out a 5 easily, this movie moved me.  What pulled me in was the subject, the Knights Templar.  What I viewed was so well done showing the lives in middle age Scandinavia.  Wow.  We have been taught to think that the Crusades was driven by the English, French, and Italians.  This movie is amazing showing the contributions of other peoples, the extreme role religion played in their lives, and the real sacrifices of those living in honor centuries ago that can and should serve as models for us today.

But this seems like the perfect portrait from swedish film industry to a great fictional character that gives life to real history behind in every step he takes.

Two thumbs up!!!",1519603200,,337,4.451612903225806
