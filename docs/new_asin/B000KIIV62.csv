8562924,5,B000KIIV62,"Having viewed the original program as it aired, it has been a truely nostalgic trip back to the ""old"" days.  To think that this does portray life, although some what ""hollywood enhansed"" but the idea of how hard and difficult life was back in the early railroad days.  Of life without running water and NO PHONES.  Using a lamp without electricity OH NOOO!!  Having to ""make"" a gift for a Christmas present instead of going to the mall and buying one!!  Children actually listening to their elders.",1252972800,,498,4.67816091954023

8562926,5,B000KIIV62,I bought this set for $15 less than what my local used book store was selling it for.,1246752000,,85,3.7777777777777777
8562927,4,B000KIIV62,I have loved Dr. Quinn ever since it was first released and I love that I can now own the entire set at home.  The only thing I don't like is that my grandma who is hearing imparied is unable to watch them because A&E didn't caption them or put subtitles for those that need them.  i even find myself missing reading along since I am so used to it.,1240963200,2,348,3.9571428571428573
8562928,5,B000KIIV62,"After missing the series when it was actually on TV, I found this to be a perfect opportunity to see the whole thing. And I wasn't disappointed.",1233360000,,144,4.37037037037037
8562929,3,B000KIIV62,There is no close-captioning and no subtitles. Not for the deaf or hard-of-hearing. We would have paid more to have that feature.,1231027200,,129,4.909090909090909
8562930,5,B000KIIV62,"This series is a must buy. What happen to the good old programs without swearing or sexual content. What happen to programs like ""little house on the prarie"" and ""somewhere in time""? Well, Dr. Quinn runs in the same category. I recommend Dr. Quinn for the whole family to watch together. You will not be disappointed with purchasing this DVD collection.",1225152000,3,353,4.80327868852459
