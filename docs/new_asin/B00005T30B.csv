1660470,3,B00005T30B,"*Zebra Lounge* isn't that great of a movie that you wanna watch repeatedly and recommend to friends.  However, it's not a total bore...it's just predictable.  If you like predictability, then by all means, watch this movie.

Alan and Wendy Barnet are bored with their marriage.  Their sex lives are practically non-existent.  They've even gone to the point of thinking about having affairs.  Nonetheless, they're trying their hardest to save the marriage.

One day, they happened to come across an adult novelty/leather store.  Alan comes across a swingers magazine.  He purchased a copy and they go home to review the magazine.  Curious and hesitant, they decide to put in an ad for a ""night of adventure"" with another couple.

Out of all the boxful of responses, the Barnets settled on Louise and Jack Bauer (Baldwin).  They agree that the initial meeting should take place at Zebra Lounge, an upscale club.  After a few moments of talk and drinks, the Barnets decide not to go through with it.  However, Jack was able to persuade them to change their mind.

Once the deed has been done, hell has begun for the Barnets.  The Bauers have started to invade their personal lives.  They've shown up at the Barnets' son's birthday party.  Jack shows up at Alan's work.  The Bauers even moved next door to the Barnets.

This film is like blackmail galore.  Every option for the Barnets' way out, the Bauers have something hanging over them.  They basically have no choice but to have additional ""adventures"" with the Bauers.  This is what the Bauers have wanted all along...a long term relationship.

I gave this film 3 stars mainly because it was purely predictable.",1169424000,,1663,4.878136200716846
1660471,3,B00005T30B,"The influence of Attraction Fatal around this script is much more than obvious. The erotic atmosphere, the sensuality and senses` delight is convincingly expressed and sumptuously suggested.

The main problem has to do with this weak script that simply cannot escape fro the anecdotic archetype and makes of the empire of the senses a warning advise. There were so many roads to explore about it; but...",1143763200,,403,5.106060606060606
1660472,4,B00005T30B,"Okay,you know this wasn't an award winning movie. I won't bore you with that and the whole plot...you can see that stuff here from the others. But i will mention that Kristy Swanson is very hot and spicy in this movie. Kristy is wicked in this movie. Kristy uses some 'provocative' language in this movie. Kristy is engaged in sensual kissing with another female in this movie.

Now you have all you need to know to rent or buy this movie.",1131494400,2,439,4.419753086419753
1660473,3,B00005T30B,"Alan (Cameron Daddo) and Wendy Barnet (Brandy Ledford) are your normal, average couple who have succumbed to sexual boredom.  One day, while visiting a sex shop, Alan buys a swingers' magazine. Of course, there is some initial hesitation, but eventually curiosity gets the best of them and they place an ad. They receive a response from a couple Jack (Stephen Baldwin) and Louise (Kristy Swanson) Bauer--who seem irresistibly charming and very good-looking. After a call from Alan, they decide to meet at a local bar, aptly titled the ""Zebra Lounge"".  A few drinks, and Wendy is feeling a little hesistant. I mean is this really what she wants? Is this going to save their marriage? The plot is superficially thin and the acting is so-so.  But you can see where this is heading, and that is part of the fun. So needless to say, the Barnet couple give in to temptation--and have a wild time with the Bauers.  After satisfying their curiosity, the Barnets are ready to throw in the towel and call it quits. But the Bauers are not so ready to be tossed to the side!! They had plans on a long-term meaningful relationship!  And that is where the PROBLEMS start!  This movie is okay, especially if you want a cheap thrill, have nothing else to do, or feel like watching some soft-porn with plenty of simulated acts.  Just be sure to put the kids to bed first.",1042416000,12,1354,4.616666666666666
1660474,1,B00005T30B,"This movie started out promising. A couple decided to become swingers. However the appearance of Stephen Baldwin quickly deminished any hopes for decent acting. The plot is even weaker. It starts out slow, builds some decent momentum and then just ends..... The ending is so stupid and pointless it's like the director just ran out script and decided to just put us all out of our misery...
Oh and if you looking for nudity, sex or anything of the sort.... look somewhere else.",1031702400,5,477,4.759036144578313
1660475,3,B00005T30B,"when i purchased this movie i thought the story would be interesting to see,the idea of the movie is good,but with a subject like this and in the beginning it says strong sexual scenes,theres no sex,the little there is is with clothes on ,some horrible acting from stephen baldwin,the other actors were ok,still woth a look",1012435200,9,323,4.785714285714286
1660476,3,B00005T30B,"Zebra Lounge (Canadian, directed by Karo Skogland) starts out like soft core porn and ends like a Hitchcock thriller. Alan (Cameron Daddo) and Wendy Barnet (Brandy Ledford) are trying to revitalize their marriage.  They flirt with the idea of swinging (gee, there's a great way to get your marriage back on track!) and meet with Jack (Stephen Baldwin) and Louise (Kristy Swanson) at the Zebra Lounge.  Initially uncertain, the Barnets end up spending a glitter-night with Jack and Louise who seem to have a lot more money and access to hot, grown-up toys than any of us should have.  The Barnets find this little foray does get them back into each other, and no more togetherness with others is needed--too bad they forgot to tell Jack and Louise . . .
From here the plot line goes down the path of films like Fatal Attraction, SWF, and (going way back) The Hitcher.  This is the ""I want to be your friend and I'm going to be your friend even if I have to kill you to do it"" story line.  Jack and Louise intrude in the Barnet's life in numerous and scary ways.  Some is believable, other parts stretch.
The acting is quite good, production values excellent.  As long as you don't think about the details too much, this is a pretty good flick.",1012348800,23,1242,4.517857142857143
1660477,2,B00005T30B,"Kari Skogland, who previously directed the throw-away Nazi teen drama ""White Lies"" with Sarah Polley, directed ""Zebra Lounge,"" an unsuccessful, run-of-the-mill take on ""Fatal Attraction.""  A married couple post an ad in a swinger sex column to rekindle the dying flame of their marital sex life, getting response from hundreds of people, including two seemingly-normal pyschotics (Kristy Swanson and Stephen Baldwin).  The film starts off as a look into the life of a failing marriage, turning into a boring, predictably unambitious thriller.  Canadian cinema has seen better days.",1012089600,,581,5.579545454545454

1660484,5,B00005T30B,"This is a strange movie that kind of reminds me of Fatal Attraction, except for those in the swing world.  What Fatal Attraction did to scare off cheating men back in its day, Zebra Lounge should do for swingers of its era.  Weird movie. Eye opening. Worth a watch.",1384041600,3,265,4.387755102040816
