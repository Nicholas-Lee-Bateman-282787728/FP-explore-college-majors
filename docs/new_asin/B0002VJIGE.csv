8033286,1,B0002VJIGE,"I caught 90% of this movie on TV and recorded it and was very impressed by it.  I wanted to watch the entire movie but what was my dismay; whoever was doing the streaming service had no less than (4) two minute intermissions in which they cut out parts of the movie and one is left with a totally blank screen and silence for each full two minute session.  I would like to have given this movie a 5 star rating but the streaming service was the worst I've ever encountered.  Some strange shenanigans indeed!  I would like to get my $3.99 back because this masquerade was totally dishonest not only to me, but to the producers of this excellent movie.  Amazon needs to find out why this movie was doctored.",1391644800,,705,4.351145038167939

8033288,5,B0002VJIGE,"Tyndale became a leading figure in Protestant reform in the years leading up to his execution. He is well known for his translation of the Bible into English. He was influenced by the work of men like the Culdee's, Wycliffeand and Desiderius Erasmus, who made the Greek New Testament available in Europe, and by Martin Luther in 1535.

 In 1536 he was convicted of heresy and executed by strangulation, after which his body was burnt at the stake.

 His dying request of our Lord God was that the King of England's eyes would be opened by our Lord God Himself, seemed to find its fulfillment just two years later with Henry's authorization of the Great Bible for the Church of England--

 However it is not a just a Bible, it is a book of God`s Pure Language (God's Word.) as it is the lexicography, alphabet, and dictionary of the English language that ""Pure Language"" God Himself said He would turn to the people, in Zephaniah 3:9 during the end days. God then gave power to the English speaking people to conquer the world and spread His ""Pure Language"", the ""Word"" so the the whole world would be able to praise the name of ""Jesus"". Hence, the Tyndale Bible, as it was known, continues to play a key role in spreading Reformation ideas across the English-speaking world, including the global British Empire.... So, God is alive as well as His Son Jesus the Christ. I guess the end days are here huh?. Thank You Lord Jesus!",1367625600,,1426,4.572549019607843
8033289,2,B0002VJIGE,"The Geneva Bible should have been given time in this movie. Sadly, it was only mentioned one time. It was the most revered Bible until they stopped printing it in 1644, due to the KJV. The people of the time coming to the new world wanted nothing to do with the KJV as it was Anglican;they were still being persecuted by them,why would they want their Bible. The notes provided by the founders of the protestant faith, contained in the Geneva Bible, were of great value to the people and King James didn't like the fact that the notes condemned the so called, ""right of kings"" doctrine he held in high regard. There were also other reasons I won't get into in this review. Shame on you for not including one of the most influential Bibles in history.",1340496000,,750,4.442028985507246
8033290,5,B0002VJIGE,"As a biblical researcher for 15 years who is not a Christian, as a historian, this was surprisingly the most accurate historical narration of what happen to the biblical text post-Christianity. It is however emotionally charged by the narrator who he seems to be a fan of many historical figures. But strip that away, and you have an uncorrupted (by liberalism, Marxism, or religious establishments) narrative of how Christianity and the bible was formed after Jesus.",1307145600,3,467,5.157894736842105
8033291,5,B0002VJIGE,"Not only did the Catholic Church forbid the possession of the Bible, as the film shows the printing presses were smashed and the Reformers were burned alive with copies of the Bible.

JOHN WYCLIFFE - MORNING STAR OF THE REFORMATION

John Wycliffe was the very first to translate the entire Bible into English, which he completed in 1382. Wycliffe translated from the Latin Vulgate. One copy of an original manuscript is in the Bodlein Library in Oxford, England. Wycliffe's Bibles were painstakingly reproduced by hand by copyists.

In 1408 the third synod of Oxford, England, banned unauthorized English translations of the Bible and decreed that possession of English translation's had to be approved by diocesan authorities. The Oxford council declared:

  ""It is dangerous, as St. Jerome declares, to translate the text of Holy Scriptures out of one idiom into another, since it is not easy in translations to preserve exactly the same meaning in all things. We therefore command and ordain that henceforth no one translate the text of Holy Scripture into English or any other language as a book, booklet, or tract, of this kind lately made in the time of the said John Wyclif or since, or that hereafter may be made, either in part or wholly, either publicly or privately, under pain of excommunication, until such translation shall have been approved and allowed by the Provincial Council. He who shall act otherwise let him be punished as an abettor of heresy and error.""

Thus the Bible was kept locked in Latin and few understood this language.

THE BIBLE PROHIBITED BY THE INDEX LIBRORUM PROHIBITORUM

Pope Pius IV had a list of the forbidden books compiled and officially prohibited them in the Index of Trent (Index Librorum Prohibitorum) of 1559.

POPE CLEMENT XI ON READING SCRIPTURE

From  UNIGENITUS, The Dogmatic Constitution issued by Pope Clement XI on Sept. 8, 1713.

POPE GREGORY XVI CONDEMNS BIBLE SOCIETIES, VERNACULAR BIBLES

From the encyclical  INTER PRAECIPUAS (On Biblical Societies) by Pope Gregory XVI, May 8, 1844:

1. Among the special schemes with which non-Catholics plot against the adherents of Catholic truth to turn their minds away from the faith, the biblical societies are prominent. They were first established in England and have spread far and wide so that We now see them as an army on the march, conspiring to publish in great numbers copies of the books of divine Scripture. These are translated into all kinds of vernacular languages for dissemination without discrimination among both Christians and infidels. Then the biblical societies invite everyone to read them unguided. Therefore it is just as Jerome complained in his day: they make the art of understanding the Scriptures without a teacher"" common to babbling old women and crazy old men and verbose sophists,"" and to anyone who can read, no matter what his status. Indeed, what is even more absurd and almost unheard of, they do not exclude the common people of the infidels from sharing this kind of a knowledge.

4. Moreover, regarding the translation of the Bible into the vernacular, even many centuries ago bishops in various places have at times had to exercise greater vigilance when they became aware that such translations were being read in secret gatherings or were being distributed by heretics. Innocent III issued warnings concerning the secret gatherings of laymen and women, under the pretext of piety, for the reading of Scripture in the diocese of Metz.[12] There was also a special prohibition of Scripture translations promulgated either in Gaul a little later[13] or in Spain before the sixteenth century.[14]

[Footnote #13: Council of Toulouse (1229), can. 14., as listed at the beginning of this article]

11. ... We again condemn all the above-mentioned biblical societies of which our predecessors disapproved. ... Besides We confirm and renew by Our apostolic authority the prescriptions listed and published long ago concerning the publication, dissemination, reading, and possession of vernacular translations of sacred Scriptures.

12. ... In particular, watch more carefully over those who are assigned to give public readings of holy scripture, so that they function diligently in their office within the comprehension of the audience; under no pretext whatsoever should they dare to explain and interpret the divine writings contrary to the tradition of the Fathers or the interpretation of the Catholic Church.

And it's been reported the Roman Church maintains Canon law forbidding unauthorized translation, and their member organisations such as the Opus Dei maintain a list of banned books.",1298937600,4,4797,5.19455252918288
8033292,1,B0002VJIGE,"I'd give this movie ZERO stars, for one simple reason:

The myth that the Bible was forbidden, esp. by the Catholic Church, at ANY point in history is absolute nonsense. The reason not every man had a bible, was because the printing press had not come around yet. The bible is a big book, and having it copied on paper was probably far, far more expensive than your average ""plow pusher"" could afford. Not to mention that giving it to ANYONE meant that some poor guy had to spend probably years copying it word for word.

Of course the ultimate rebuttal is this: Catholics have always HEARD the bible read at Church, so even those poor people who couldn't even read, or who couldn't SEE, let alone read, STILL got the bible from and in the Catholic Church. The book was never forbidden! At least not by anything more than lack of an easy way to copy it.

Some ignorant people have, however, heard that Catholics are forbidden to read the bible WITHOUT ACCURATE COMMENTARY... which is both true and prudent... only they have confused that with them being forbidden to read it at all. But by your fruits you will know whether the practice of doing so is good or bad. Taking the bible ""any way you like"" has not led to the spiritual enlightenment of mankind, but to the creation of an endless number of warring sects, all fighting over what they think scripture means, ""to their own destruction"" as scripture itself says! (God, meanwhile, being perfect and perfectly honest, cannot contradict Himself, unlike the people reading the bible and making up their own interpretation of it, and their own religions to go along with it.)

We can't re-invent history according to our feelings. The ancient language, and meaning of that language in context, requires proper understanding of what it really did mean AT THAT TIME... thus, the Church's wise mandate that Catholics read the bible WITH PROPER COMMENTARY... which means we will actually know what it really did mean (we don't have to wonder, or fumble intellectually for the proper context), and which is still something far, far different than forbidding them to read it at all. Rather everyone is encouraged to read it, and even if they don't want to, they will still hear it every time they go to Church.

So the idea of the bible as ""a forbidden book"" at any point in history is absolutely nonsense. Unless perhaps you're in one of those countries where it's forbidden to be a Christian, and that other religion tries to forbid it. Otherwise, the bible has been open to everyone since it was compiled, BY THAT VERY CHURCH that people so love to condemn. It was forbidden to change it, to mis-represent it, and things like that. But not to read it. What happened when Luther and the rest got hold of scripture? They tore out the books they didn't like, and everything that disagreed with their ideas, and it's been the most altered and ravaged text ever since.

Give me the Catholic bible any day... in tact, and with all the original language and context there for the reading. I don't want ""freedom"" to try to imagine a different version of what it says. I want the TRUTH, and the only way to get that is by looking at the text AS IT WAS, and having with it the knowledge of what those words meant at that time, so that I may read it without any doubt about what it really and truly said, and what it really and truly means, all emotional ecstasy aside.",1294358400,,3406,4.575409836065574
8033293,5,B0002VJIGE,"The Forbidden Book is a DVD presentation examining the history of the Word of God in English. It is hosted by Dr. Craig Lampe, a Bible historian and International Director of the World Bible Society. Dr. Lampe owns the Rare Bible Showroom in Arizona and holds a virtual monopoly over rare and antique Bibles. His collection even includes a 1410 Wycliffe Manuscript valued at just under $3 million. It is one of the rarest Bibles in the world. He has a Coverdale Bible, Great Bibles, sells leaves of the Geneva Bible, and, amazingly enough, leaves from the Gutenberg Bible - the first book ever published. If you happen to have one of these complete Bibles sitting in your attic, you should have it insured for about $100 million.

This DVD is an hour-long presentation on the history of the English Bible. The viewer will meet most of the historical figures responsible for bringing us the Bible as we know and love it today: Wycliffe, Hus, Gutenberg, Colet, Erasmus, Tyndale, Luther and so on. He will see some of the locations important to the history of the Bible, such as the Wittenberg door and Martin Luther's study. He will learn about the earliest English translations, in the Old World and in the New.

There are many amazing facts worked into the presentation. Lampe shows a scroll that is 1000 years old, and tells the viewer that it is word-for-word the same as the text of the Dead Sea Scrolls that were written a full millennium before. He describes how the Bible went from being available in 500 languages in 400 AD to being available in only 1 only 100 years later. He talks about a 110 year period in America during which 5000 editions of the Bible were produced.

In short, it is quite an informative and enjoyable video. The production quality is a little bit uneven (the host can be a bit awkward at times (what do you do with your hands when you're on camera?) and there are places where the camera shakes a little bit during panning shots. But on the whole the quality is quite good. It is a bit strange that the only information given about who produced this video are the name of the host and, at the very end, his web site. There are no further credits. I know from the information given on various e-commerce sites that it is produced by New Liberty Videos, a company that does not seem to have an Internet presence.

Being reminded of the blood that was shed to bring the Bible to common folk like myself, makes me consider just how flippantly I treat the Scriptures. Do I really have a sense of how privileged I am to have not just one Bible but an entire stack of them in many outstanding translations? And do I thank God for the faithful men and women who gave their lives that I can have unlimited access to His Word? Do I really understand how unique my situation is? I suspect I do not often enough consider these things.

Before I close, I will warn that the host is quite harsh towards the Roman Catholic Church and their role in the history of the English Bible. And well he should be, as the papacy worked tirelessly to eradicate any person who dared to present the Scriptures to the common man. Of course the fears of the Church were founded, for when Scripture became accessible, the light quickly broke forth and spread throughout the world.

At Greatsite.com the advertisement for this video says, ""Hundreds of Church Sunday School classes and Christian home-schoolers use it as part of their curriculum."" I would agree that this presentation would be useful for those purposes. It would make a valuable addition to a church, school or even public library. It would also make a great gift. And of course it is also a valuable addition to a person library. I very much enjoyed this video and am sure to watch it again. I recommend it.",1119052800,16,3774,4.54264705882353
8033294,5,B0002VJIGE,"The best presentation I have ever seen on the story of the Bible. Every person that loves God, His Word, and cherishes the great sacrifices of those who have labored to protect, proclaim and publish that Word needs to become well acquainted with the history and the testimonies in this documentary.
