8754554,2,B01D01K5YQ,"A completely unlikeable jerk suffering a post breakup emotional crisis becomes an even bigger unlikeable jerk. Roxy Saint (the only reason I watched) is pretty much playing herself - sexy and incoherent; but what was Robert Wagner doing in this? Hiding from the most recent Natalie Wood unlawful death investigation? If this film is what's left of his career they'll never find him. Reminds me of Brown Bunny in its absurd degree of camera hogging, self-pitying narcissism.",1533081600,,473,5.1558441558441555
8754555,4,B01D01K5YQ,"I watched this movie and wanted to review it but I wasn't sure what to say. I have watched it a second time and I am still unsure. The movie's main flaw is the central issue in every Josh Evans movie: the gratuitous profanity. Though, I was pleased the vulgar cussing was kept to a minimum with the exception of a few scenes. Marshall Bell, playing the family lawyer, did a phenomenal job in his role as did Robert Wagner as the central character's father. The movie also has awesome visuals. You see the various colors and hues of Los Angeles. Simply stunning location shots. The best scenes are between our protagonist Adam and his father and lawyer. The music in this movie is perfect. It is some of the most atmospheric and beautiful music I have ever heard in a film. I saw a four minute preview for this film on youtube. It was absolutely mesmerizing but it turned out most of the footage in the preview wasn't in the movie. It shows what it could have been.",1521763200,,964,4.391061452513966
8754556,1,B01D01K5YQ,"It's mostly a disagreeable guy talking incessantly about his divorce and his movie. Sound boring? It is. What are supposed to be a lawyer and a therapist are hanging around, but they don't contribute anything. The scenes are incoherent and jump confusingly from past to present. It just stops with no attempt at an ending.",1489017600,,322,4.872727272727273

8754558,2,B01D01K5YQ,"I don't like hating on a film. But given how many films are waiting to be done I have to wonder why this one got made.

I live in LA and that is the reason I watched it all the way through, the only fun I had was in trying to identify all the locations. The film it is trying to be stylish by using a handheld, constantly moving camera, they clearly did not have the budget for  a tripod much less a steady cam rig. Its not cinema verite, it is bad shooting and even the static landscape shots bounce for no good reason.  The bouncy scenes are then edited in disconnected ways to make it seem more artsy and deep.  Those scenes presumably were to get all tied up together at the end.  The problem is, they don't and you stop caring pretty quickly.  The reason I gave it two big stars is that the actors are doing their best with what must have been a very thin and messy script. This is a miss....",1476230400,6,897,4.03954802259887
