3613902,1,B001GLLMUE,"If the investigation looking for Elizabeth Smart actually happened like it was portrayed in this movie, there would be something wrong with our law enforcement. The people who made this movie are silly. It was something written by a 5 year old. First, the police should've used dogs to sniff out Elizabeth in the woods from the beginning. And by the time they do, Elizabeth is still in the woods but somehow the dogs manage not to find her...okay. Also, not to mention that the little girl who witnessed her sister's kidnapping was never shown a picture of the suspect in custody for the kidnapping. It isn't until she happened to catch a picture of him in the newspaper that she was able to rule him out as the kidnapper. The movie was ridiculous. I feel like half of the things that the real Elizabeth weren't even touched on and the way they showed the police investigation was disgusting. Lifetime shouldn't have even tried to make this movie.",1371772800,4,947,4.642857142857143

3613904,5,B001GLLMUE,"Like so many, this story capitavted me from start to finish and it's great to have the whole version on DVD.
Very realistic, good acting and covers- it seems- all key points and events.
I had a feeling this DVD would be excellent- even without seeing any previews- and it was.",1264809600,10,276,4.431372549019608

3613921,4,B001GLLMUE,"Well-done story of parents proving more useful than authorities. I bought it because after watching Heartland I wanted to see how Amber Marshall was in other parts. Titular, but a fairly small role in this, she was fine. She's better than fine now. Even then, she had amazing eyes. In Heartland, her kindness shows through and completes her characterization of a role she was born to play. In Smart, those eyes, combined with the mask over her lower face, are haunting.",1425945600,3,469,4.802469135802469
3613922,5,B001GLLMUE,"The story broke my heart and Amber Marshall, The girl who played the part of Elizabeth was so convincing I forgot I was watching a movie. This tragic true story will forever be embedded in my memories",1423353600,,200,4.4324324324324325
3613923,5,B001GLLMUE,"Wonderful presentation of a terrible tragedy.  It was done tastefully, with the awful things only implied.  Amber Marshall was terrific.  My wife and I had read the book a few years earlier on a long trip from Georgia to Utah and back.  We love Amber Marshall as Amy Flemming in the Canadian TV series Heartland and have watched all 8 seasons on either Netflix or YouTube.",1418947200,,372,4.590909090909091
3613924,5,B001GLLMUE,"I enjoyed the movie.
It conveyed some important parts of the terrible crime with out vivid graphic details.
It is a movie that I would let younger teens can watch and then have a discussions with as to how can we help keep them safer and calm some of their fears.",1409356800,,263,4.176470588235294

8305788,4,B001GLLMUE,"I watched the film after reading the book. Therefore I had that background in my head. It made the film that much more stirring.
When the family reunites I can feel the amazingness of that moment.
  There is nothing showing she is raped and used that way so if watching with someone sensitive to those things, no need to worry .
  Overall I found the movie and acting to be well done.
  I highly recommend reading Elizabeth Smart's book. Her story of overcoming is inspirational and makes ""problems "" in my life seem like nothing .",1461283200,3,531,4.479166666666667
8305789,1,B001GLLMUE,"I read Elizabeth Smarts book and then I watched the movie. The movie was actually boring. I yawned through the whole thing. The dad.....oh my gosh ...he COULD NOT act if his life depended on it! Whoever played Elizabeth Smarts dad did a horrible job! The mom made it believable she did and excellent job. I guess this movie was ripped from the headlines because it was made in 2003, Elizabeth published her book in 2013. Her book has way more details. Maybe Elizabeth should consider redoing the movie because this one was horrible.",1460073600,,532,4.670212765957447
8305790,5,B001GLLMUE,Excellent and thorough and gently filmed account of Elizabeth Smart's horrifying kidnapping and subsequent return to her loving family. Very well done and I enjoyed it very much.,1454371200,,178,5.392857142857143

8305794,5,B001GLLMUE,"Really hit home when I watched this movie.  I went to Salt Lake right around the time that she went missing.  As shown in the movie, she was forced to wear some weird robes to cover her face.  I recall seeing a young lady in Salt Lake City like that right before she was found.  I am convienced it was here.  Before you hire help to work on your house, go through an agent instead of hiring some homeless person off the street, Good show though/",1444780800,,445,4.127906976744186
