8474112,1,B00116XGZS,"Not much drag racing shown...mainly interviews with a few people that brought their harleys to Las Vegas to race at one event some time back. may be interesting for non races or novice harley riders, but nothing for experienced drag racers or veteran motorcyclists of any brand. does not include any racers of known experience.",1397520000,,327,4.963636363636364
8474113,1,B00116XGZS,"This was a total disappointment. If you're looking for something that has any drag racing of motorcycles in it...it's not in here.
 It's mostly inane interviews with oddball spectators or vendors with a tad of actual race participant interviews that are boring as hell!
I Highly recommend you pass on this DVD.",1291766400,,310,4.961538461538462
