8364394,5,B002CRNEMA,"The instructor gives clear and calm instructions and keeps talking to a minimum. This allows the focus to be more inward. The DVD is useful addition to my KY DVD collection.

I found the pace slower than the Ravi/ Ana DVDs which I also enjoy and use. It has some poses/ exercises which are not in their DVDs.

I suppose the production is less fancy but this is not a problem for me.",1266278400,,382,4.219178082191781
