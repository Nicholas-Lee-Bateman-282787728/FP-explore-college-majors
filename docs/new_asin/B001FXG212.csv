3589447,5,B001FXG212,"Only other time I payed this much for anime was FLCL (6 episodes, 80 bucks)
Now I've payed 70 for the first 9 episodes of Gurren Lagann, having bought the first, sub-only release, and now rebuying for this. But I'm not buying the new releases for the dub. I'm buying them for three reasons. First, I wanted the artbox. It opens by lifting the top side, which open's the Gurren's mouth. The second is the special features. The first releases only had the show, nothing more, and while the features on this are still pretty light, they're better than nothing. Finally, the Core Drill. While not as nice looking as the drill that comes with the Revoltech figure (it's a LITTLE stubby), it evens out in the fact that when you flip a switch, the golden drill glows green with spiral energy. Now, I can go out in public, flip the switch, point into the air and shout ""MINE IS THE DRILL THAT SHALL PIERCE THE HEAVENS! ORE O DARE DATTO OMOTE YAGERU?""",1227225600,23,942,4.4508670520231215
3589448,5,B001FXG212,"Studio GAINAX, the creators of ""FLCL"", ""Gunbuster"" and the infamous ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" have another brilliant piece of work on their hands. While Evangelion subverted the convetions of the giant robot genre, this series embraces the cliches and puts a whole new spin on them. The animation is beautiful (aside from episode 4) and remains so for the duration of the series. I highly recommend this show to fans of Mecha Anime, Evangelion and the other works of GAINAX. It may not be too sophisticated, but it has a lot of spirit and is generally just plan fun.",1225065600,,566,4.785714285714286
3589449,5,B001FXG212,"Gurren Lagann is one of the best anime shows I have seen in a while.  It goes way over the top and enjoys doing it.  It is a show that unapologetically pushes the boundaries of absurdity, and makes it seem not so absurd.

This DVD will have the English Dub tracks, as well as the original Japanese tracks.  If you only want the Japanese version, go to the store right now, Gurren Lagann Volumes 1-3 Subtitles only is on the shelves for only $20 a disc, nine episodes per disc.  This looks to be a more traditional anime DVD release.  $60 Special Edition, $35 regular edition, you're looking at two discs covering the first eight episodes or so.  The Drill LED looks to be pretty cool and the box art also seems stylish.  This should be a pretty good release.

That's about $18 per four episodes of Dubbed versions, as opposed to $20 for nine episodes of the Sub only version.  Shop wisely!",1222560000,18,889,4.398773006134969

3589452,5,B001FXG212,"I bought this set to replace the defective disk 1 from another item (""Gurren Lagann: Complete Collection (Anime Legends)""). Especially since it came with the art box and core drill accessory.

The artbox is great! the two disks come in their own case, and there is room foor 4 more DVD cases, which covers the whole series. The box is minimally durable (time setting loose in the trunk of my car kinda messed up the top flap's joints. ~fixed with tape, kinda) so it is more for a shelf and closet than for anything else (should be obvious, just sharing).

The drill is ok, nothing outstanding, but a nice cheap prop: a large plastic accessory (cheap) with an LED inside and power switch for the LED on the top (flat side of cone).

And of course my disk works perfectly, and overall, this is a great item to buy if you are willing to drop a bit extra on getting the artbox in addition to the part 1 disks.",1379203200,,905,4.34319526627219

3589454,5,B001FXG212,"First off, Gurren Lagann is a fantastic show and a must see for any anime fan. I had anticipated the art box being flimsy but to my surprise its actually quite sturdy (not to mention looking bad ass). For the price its a great buy. The only issue is that to complete this set you're lookin to spend another 130 bucks on the second set (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gurren-Lagann-Part-2-Limited-Edition/dp/B001K98MI2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gurren Lagann: Part 2 (Limited Edition)</a>) and 100 on the final set (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gurren-Lagann-Part-3-Limited-Edition/dp/B001OBBRAG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gurren Lagann: Part 3 (Limited Edition)</a>), which is to be expected for a collectors edition. If your looking for a cheaper alternative there is a complete collection for $99 or you can buy the English subbed parts. Speaking of which be careful when buying the sets (it can be somewhat confusing tryin to find the right matching volumes; I made the mistake of buying the subbed part 2 version (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gurren-Lagann-2/dp/B001AZ5IUQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gurren Lagann 2</a>)  because it was in the ""customers often purchased this item with"" section. I'm not goin to go through the effort to return it, and I can's stand having an incomplete collection so I will be buying the subbed part 1 and 3 as well as the collectors edition of part 2 and 3. And if you are a hardcore fan you can find the blu-ray special edition for a whopping 500 some dollars.

He saw that the outside packaging stated there was a light-up drill inside and tore right into it. Unfortunately for the both of us there was no drill. Inside a sealed box there was an item missing which raises an eyebrow. He claimed not to worry about it because he really enjoyed the thought. I still am a little miffed about it, I felt really bad I didn't receive what I thought I paid for. Definitely a great show and worth collecting, but if you're looking foward to that drill, just wanting to let you guys know about my experience.",1365552000,2,669,4.4471544715447155

3589466,5,B001FXG212,"Yesterday, I receive my Limited Edition Gurren Lagann Part 1 Set. When I opened the box, I found it very well packaged, shrink-wrapped to a piece of cardboard to preserve the box's shape (I bought my set from Amazon Warehouse). On the box, the Lagann's mouth is actually a magnetic flap, allowing you to open the box from the top. The box is actually meant to hold all of the volumes, so a cardboard filler is placed there to fill the hole. The set came packaged with the first two volumes of the series (bilingual) and the core drill. The DVDs are some of the best DVD releases of the series (so I hear; I haven't used mine yet). The Core Drill is actually pretty neat. It has a switch to make it glow green (it's a steady light; it doesn't pulse like in the series). The entire thing is plastic, and looks a little cheap. But, it's really awesome. I added a leather string around it to make it a necklace. Overall, it's one of the nicest anime sets I own.",1359590400,,957,4.263736263736264

But when you include the compelling, overwhelming, dramatic and climactic series of Gurren Lagann, it takes it to a whole new level. For 18 bucks, you are getting an amazing deal. You are getting one of the greatest series in the history of anime. The characters will drill (pun intended)into your hearts for a life time. It teaches a fantastic life lesson and admirable morals all should live by. The character Kamina is a person who we all could take advice from.

The order was great. I expected the collecter's box to be tin, but great all the less. I highly recomend this to anyone who likes Anime or robot fighting or plain (crude) humor.",1340064000,,435,4.576923076923077

The packaging is really well done, as a collector of anime and a fan of nice box sets, i am really happy with this purchase.  for example, the way the box opens is different in that there is a flap on the top that is help down magnetically.  also, it opens at a the point where gurren's mouth is which is a nice touch.  it is also a sturdy box so you can feel comfortable that it won't get bent or dented.  finally the light that comes with it is a nice addition which isn't anything extremely exciting but fun all the same.

This series has levity and the fan service that you want out of an anime, but also has some prety dark moments, giatn robot battles, overarching story that isn't totally out there and a satisfying ending that doesn't leave you wondering what the heck you just watched.

I've heard that there may be more Gurren Lagann to come, I hope that's true.

Their enthusiasm puts you on the edge of your seat all the way through. The story is so over the top, it's amazing. Just when you think it can't get any more ridiculous, you're surprised yet again.

Forget what you may or may not have heard, and even if you've seen the first few episodes, you have no idea what's in store for you in the rest of the series.  Every episode seems to take it up a notch into absurdity, but that is the best part about this series.  It never asks for understanding, it just pushes itself over the top at every turn.  It's purely fun and enjoyable and a third of the way through the series it gut checks you, and you'll finally start to understand what it is that makes Gurren Lagann stand apart from other anime.

The only problem is with the DVDs themselves, (which is the only reason I gave it 3 stars and not 5)or maybe just the production team behind the translation.  Where the original Japanese version made no apologies for cussing and lude behavior, us Americans cannot be offered the same it seems.  Our ways are different, and I understand why the US DVD release lacks the continued cussing that the original had so much of.  But it really dents into the impact of the speeches of many of the lead characters.  And it really drove over a lot of the comedic aspects of the original.  I'd give you an example but even here I'm limited with my words.

Overall though, the series is still fantastic, and now your younger ones can actually enjoy it if they wish to as most of the crude stuff has been removed properly.  It's still a lot of robot smashing action though, so be aware that violence does ensue at every turn.  But that's the other half of what makes this anime so great: the insane over the top robot smashing action.  It takes Voltron, Gundam, Macross (Robotech), and Evangelion into account but never refers backwards.  The show does its own thing knowingly embarking on the continued essence of mech anime.  Everything feels fresh if not mildly cliched, but everything is as it should be.  It uses the best of animes before it, and will be a building block for those to come after it.

Watch it if you haven't yet, you can't possibly not be entertained.",1238371200,6,2032,4.445945945945946

3589487,3,B001FXG212,"I've been a Gainax fanboy for years after seeing classics like ""Evangellion"", ""FLCL"", and ""Abenobashi Magical Shopping Arcade"", so I've been eagerly awaiting the next Gainax offering to blow me off my seat. ""This Ugly Yet Beautiful World"" didn't impress me as anything out of the ordinary, so I was really looking forward to ""Gurren Lagann"".

What I always look forward to in a Gainax production is the way they sacrilegiously portray anime archetypes and their new approaches in attacking the 3 act story telling structure of the 30 minute slot comedy genre.

After watching the first disk of Gurren Lagann I found that the protagonists, a foolhardy young man and a reluctantly heroic eight year old are pretty much carbon copy type-casts with a pretty common alien enemy to fight against and save their village from.  The heroine is a tribute to the fan-service of old, the only thing she's missing is the circa 1980's bunny ears.  Pretty see-through so far, oh wait, the protag's two robots can combine!  Well they do so in an unorthodox fashion so as to buck the convention (take that Voltron) but this hardly seems original, even when spoofing it.

The hero's wander through the wastelands of their world looking for more enemies to slay, and they assemble an entourage of various support characters a la Genesis Climber Mospeada (Robotech 3rd Generation).  The whole thing had me thinking of ""Desert Punk"" with giant robots, twice the screaming and 1/2 cleaveage.  All of this is average for any other anime studio, but Gainax should aim a little higher.

I still look forward to Gainax' next great series. Perhaps they should should take Haruko's advice from FLCL and, ""Try hitting it into the sky"", the results should be far from ordinary.",1232841600,2,1747,4.894915254237288

It's the single word that describes how I feel about ""GURREN LAGANN SET 01 released by Bandai Entertainment.

GAINAX brings us a mecha anime series and having created so many and with so many created for so many decades, you often wonder if innovative, imaginative storylines can still be developed.  Well, with ""GURREN LAGANN"", the creators of this anime series manages to create something unique, fun, explosive and just enjoyable.

With this first volume set, we get both vol. 1 (Episodes 1-5) and vol. 2 (Episodes 6-9) of ""GURREN LAGANN"".  The popular anime titled ""Tengen Toppai Gurren Lagann"" aired on TV Tokyo back in April 2007 and completed it's 27-episodes by Sept. 2007 and centers around two characters Simon and Kamina.

Both live underground with a bunch of orphans and due to earthquakes, they developed a system of people using manual drilling holes in order to move around.  But one day, the life of a young driller named Simon discovers a small mini drill underground. Simon is a shy young guy.  Not too confident in himself and hates how his parents were killed during an earthquake.  So, he works hard in order for everyone to live but also to collect whichever treasure he can find.  While continuing his digging, he discovers a small drill and not long after, he discovers a huge robotic face.

As for Kamina, he's the cool leader of a gang.  He once saw the atmosphere with his father a long time ago and dreams of making it up to the surface but no one underground believes him.  He comes up with a plan to get to the surface with the help of Simon's drill.  The plan backfires and Kamina is put into a jail.  Meanwhile, a big monster robot-like figure comes out of the sky and lands in the group's village underground.  A girl sporting a bikini top and tight short shorts with a large rifle starts fighting with the monster robot.  Her name is Yoko and all of a sudden both Kamina and Simon try to assist her.

As the monster grows vicious, Simon introduces Kamina and Yoko to what he found underground.  It happens to be a small robot that Simon takes control of and eventually the three fight the robotic monster and end up defeating it. Also, end up making it above the surface where they discover sunlight, blue skies, mountains and more...monster robots.  It is learned that these things are called ""Gunmen"" and are piloted by Beastmen who have a hatred towards humans.  The three must survive and outwit and defeat the Gunmen and with Kamina's leadership and willing to take anything head on with his machismo ego, he calls Simon's robot Lagann.  Kamina eventually comandeers a Gunmen robot and calls it Gurren.  As a duo, the group is called Gurren Lagann.

Vol. 1 consists of episodes 1-5 and Vol. 2 consists of episodes 6-9.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

Each episode is  featured in 1:78:1 Anamorphic Widescreen.  The character designs by Atsushi Nishigori are fresh and very different.  I truly dig the character designs and the whole anime is quite colorful and looks stylish and pretty cool.

As for the audio, I've watched both episodes in Japanese 2.0 and English 5.1 and as much as I enjoyed the Japanese voice track, when I watch an action-packed mecha, Digital 5.1 sountracks make a big difference for me in terms of enjoying a series and with that being said, I am very pleased with the English vocal dub.  You have some quality voice talent with Kyle Herbert as Kamina (does the voice of Son Goku  in ""Dragon Ball Z""), Michelle Ruff as Yoko (does the voice of Rukia for ""Bleach"") and Yuri Lowenthal (does the voice for many video games and anime such as Sasuke Uchiha for ""Naruto"").

There is a lot of action, so you do get some good usage from your front channels and some surround usage.  But the dialogue comes quite clear and overall, both video and audio were well done.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

This is where you can find some very awesome special features.  Let's start with the volume 1 DVD:

  * Yoko Goes to Gainax - Voice actress for Yoko (Marina Inoue) goes to GAINAX and sees how people create ""Gurren Lagann"".  This lengthy featurette features Marina  learning the difference between ""Key Animation"" and ""In-Between Animation"" and ""Composition"".  She actually takes part in doing in-between work for the first time and also, learning some of the jobs the staff did for ""Gurren Lagann"".  A very fun featurette!
  * GAINAX Staff Interview - A very cool featurette with director Hiroyuki Imaishi and other staff on the concept of ""Gurren Lagann"" and what their goal was in creating this anime series.  Another cool featurette!
  * Preview of Episode 6 - A preview of the upcoming interview
  * Bandai Previews

With the second volume, the special features are:

  * Televised Version of Episode 6 - With this episode being quite a bit sexual as Kamina and Simon try to get a peek at the women without their clothes on in the hot tubs, this version that aired on the Sci Fi Channel features more of a flashback episode and edited with less focus on the horniness of Kamina and Simon and more about them working together as a team.  This is presented only in 2.0 Stereo.
  * Textless Opening and Ending themes - For those who love the cool music of opening theme ""Sorairo Days"" by Shoko Nakagawa and ending theme ""Underground"" by High Voltage.
  * US & Japanese Trailers
  * Bandai Previews

I can't help but think how awesome this series was to watch!  From the stylish presentation, the wacky humor, the adult-like humor and pervertedness and the imaginative mecha Gunmen robots and attack modes, the battles and the fun characters and the music, there is just too much to like about ""Gurren Lagann"".  I absolute found the series to be quite fantastic!

The character of Kamina is just so wild and crazy with how he is just so carefree and just doesn't plan for battle, he just does what he believes in and what he thinks is right and decides at the spur of the moment.  He has a way with his words, no matter how crazy it may sound but it makes his character so cool!

As for Simon, he is simply the underdog.  He is a major component to the team because he pilots Lagann but at the same time, his fear and his emotions get the best of him.

Yoko, her character is sexy and cool.  Sometimes you wonder if GAINAX or the character designer Atsushi Nishigori created such a sexy character for the purpose of being sexy or for the fact that many cosplayers will try to emulate the character and not wear much clothes.  Nevertheless, her character is cool as her body features somehow provide the fan service and also gets Simon distracted.

And of course, you have a group of other characters that are starting to come their own and as we become supportive human characters, you take special notice of their mecha (Gunmen).  They have a sort of character themselves because they are an extension of the people that pilot them but the amount of power demonstrated by them and what is unknown about the gunmen they pilot is just amazing.

And of course, this anime series is action-packed.  In fact, there is a good balance of humor and action and each episode keeps your eyes glued to your television set and when it's all done, it leaves you craving for more.

This first box set of ""Gurren Lagann"" is highly recommended to mecha fans, anime action fans and those who just want to experience an anime that is stylish in presentation and just enjoyable and fun with it's storyline more!

""Gurren Lagann"" can be described in one word and that is ""Fantastic!""",1231718400,17,7503,4.630022744503412

8302946,5,B001FXG212,"It is a box set with the first half of this show and is exactly what you would think that means. I have one major pro and one minor con. This box set comes with an awesome box. The box is the GL head and the mouth opens for the DVDs inside, nifty right? The minor con is the drill necklace. I like it, I really do. It is nice. The construction though is a little cheap, it is just plastic and hovers somewhere between cheap and sturdy and the light is a single LED inside which does glow green but unless it was pretty dark, the light is a bit disappointing (it doesn't even light the whole drill if the room is half lit). That being said I still like that it is included. Gurren Lagann is one of my top three animes and this is a pretty nice box set, I just wish it contained both DVDs instead of making you buy the second separately, I mean, the show isn't even that long and they even left spare room in the head-shaped box for the second case.

If you like the show, chances are you will like this set (but please remember to buy the second DVD if you want the whole series).",1405900800,,1079,4.018604651162791
