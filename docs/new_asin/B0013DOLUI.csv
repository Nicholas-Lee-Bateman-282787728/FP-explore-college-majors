8250366,2,B0013DOLUI,"Be careful before ordering!  On the Amazon page, I was looking for the 1980 Movie The Exterminator, which showed the right cover art.  It led me to this page, which was entitled ""Exterminator"", with The History Channel logo, which I think is not the same thing.  It needs to be corrected.  Amazon is usually really terrific and doesn't make mistakes, but occasionally a mistake will happen.  Amazon, please correct this mistake.  I was required to provide a star rating, so that's why I picked two stars.  Amazon, you don't have to post this, but please correct the mistake.",1421625600,,574,4.795918367346939
