509949,5,6302779766,I was so excited when I saw this movie had been released on DVD.  My sister and I taped it off of television when it first aired back in the 80's and I've watched the tape so many times that you have to turn the volume of the television all the way up to hear the movie.  Now I can buy it on DVD and introduce it to my kids someday!,1098489600,4,332,3.6619718309859155

509952,5,6302779766,"...Dance til' Dawn was a good movie...  It was basically centered around the Prom.  Kevin McCrae (Brian Bloom) asked Angela Strull (Tracy Gold) out on a date because his friend lied and said that she was ""easy"".  He ended up falling for her, but she had already found out why he asked her out in the first place so she dumped him.  The whole time Angelea's father (Kelsy Grammar)was following them. Meanwhile Shelley Sheridan (Alyssa Milano), Kevin's ex-gf ends up spending time with Leftcourt (Chris DeYoung), the geek of the school and she ends up falling for him.
I really enjoyed this movie because it was funny.  I highly recommend it for a good laugh.",1017619200,14,657,4.678260869565217
509953,4,6302779766,"It's about time this late-eighties gem was released to DVD.  Loved the movie then (back in my junior-high and high-school days), still love it.  Accidentally taped over my VCR-from-TV copy; am glad it's being reissued, this time to a better format.  So many big names in one hilarious movie - and folks, this doesn't happen very often!  :)",1017360000,12,339,4.793103448275862
509954,5,6302779766,"I first saw ""Dance Til Dawn"" in 1990 on NBC -- it originally aired in 1988. This 'made-for-TV' film starred a virtual pantheon of 1980s T.V. pop culture icons like Tempest Bledsoe, Tracy Gold, Alyssa Milano, Alan Thicke, and Christina Applegate. Since then, it has become an obscure, much sought-after piece of 80s nostalgia. I've seen it sell for a lot of money (I've lost two auctions on this one, and I bid high - trust me). Future ""Friends"" star Matthew Perry is a featured cast member in this film as well; was probably his first or second role in Hollywood (besides ""Married with Children"", and ""Just the Ten of Us"").
The basic gist of the storyline is this: the most popular guy in school (played by a then seemingly destined-for-fame actor, Brian Bloom) decides he doesn't want to go to the prom with the most popular girl in school (played by a stunningly cute Alyssa Milano), so he asks the not-so-popular girl (Tracey Gold) to the prom [the day of, mind you] because he hears [not true] that she's ""easy"". The fun starts here, within the first ten minutes.
BUT, the funniest character by far (please believe me!) is the man who plays Tracey Gold's dad...the one and only Kelsey Grammer. Kelsey's character is understandably concerned that his daughter (Tracey) is going to the prom with the most popular guy (Brian Bloom) in school. Let's put it this way: Kelsey's character is a pharmacist at the drugstore. Brian Bloom's character walks in to obtain a necessary 'drugstore' product to enjoy his prom night ""safely"". Later that night when Brian Bloom's character shows up at the doorstep of Kelsey's house to pick up Tracey??? Uh-oh.
Of course there is another major subplot (Alyssa Milano's character) but I will leave that for you to discover for yourselves. Also note the great music by Richard (Dick) Rudolph, a great 70s and 80s producer (New Edition, his late [great] wife Minnie Riperton for example). Heatwave's ""Grooveline"" makes an appearance at the dance as well. What an awesome movie folks...especially if you don't mind a little 'star-studded' cheese every now and then.
By the way...I rented this film at a video outlet close to where I live. I couldn't believe my eyes when I found it. All I can say is that if you remember loving this movie when you were younger, and laughing out loud...I can almost guarantee that you will still laugh out loud today. I did - especially at Kelsey Grammer's character...he's the best.
Thanks for reading!

509989,5,6302779766,"Great cheesy late 80's/early 90's movie!  It was a favorite at our high school sleepovers, so I figured it would be fun to get it for an old friend's birtday!  She was thrilled! We ended up watching it with martinis and remembering old times...",1280880000,,244,4.5227272727272725
509990,5,6302779766,"I liked this movie when it came out and still do.  It's definitely dated, but if you grew up in the 80's it's a blast from the past!",1280620800,,132,3.7142857142857144
509991,4,6302779766,"I remember seeing this made for TV movie when I was a kid.  Nice, G rated entertainment for anyone seeking a harmless bit of entertainment.  It starred a plethora of late 80s / early 90s teen TV actors and actresses who would mostly continue onto adulthood successfully.  In the backdrop of prom night, it turns into a comedy of errors as one after another mishap will unfold for the characters.  Christina Applegate is the stuck up Patrice who is controlling her weak boyfriend, Roger (a very pre Chandler Bing / Matthew Perry from Friends), ending up stuck in the city in a limping attempt to find their way home.  Alyssa Milano before the breast augmentation surgery, at the peak of her popularity on Who's The Boss, is Shelly, the most popular girl in school, who can't bare to show her face dateless at the prom, ends up playing a game of cat and mouse all night with Dan, an otherwise well meaning, awkward dork, who is also hiding from his smothering father.  Perhaps the most appealing of stories is that of Angela, Tracy Gold, perhaps the most socially awkward of nerd girls, who is asked by Kevin, played with all the studly sass of Brian Bloom at his peak, the Alpha Male of their high school, to the prom.  He only asks her because his studly buddies claim that she is an easy lay.  Instead, she emerges in the classic Ugly Duckling story as the beautiful swan, and elected queen of the prom.  Kevin finds that he really does like her, even though he goes so far as to attempt to have his way with her and learns his lesson.

It's a rather silly thing to look at now.  That so called wild party that Patrice was throwing after the prom is about as threatening as a tea party with the Seven Dwarves.  Although Kevin plays the so called stud who is after one thing, he doesn't come off as ""bad enough"" to be just that.  Another thing : When his buddies are standing around talking about who is apparently the easiest of the easy in their locker room talk, ask yourself how much of that is talk and how much of that is truth?  Sometimes you just don't know but assume what you want to.  And in the scene where Kevin attempts to make a move on Angela, another falsity.  It's not boys who are doing the pressuring and demanding (at least during the high school period), but girls who tend to be the aggressors.  Obviously for the sake of storytelling purposes it had to be the other way around, but once again, truth is stranger than fiction.

The best parts of the movie were the role of the parents, as well as the worst.  Kelsey Grammar and Edie McClurge emerge as the classic overprotective parents who are chasing after Angela in attempt to rescue her from the lecherous advances of Kevin.  Alan Thicke is kind of a buddy Dad whose role is rather neutral.  The marital problems between Applegate's parents really have no role in the events of the prom, save for the fact that they are chaperons of the prom.  Otherwise, their marital banter really has no place in the movie.

A nice evening when you have nothing else to do.  And a trip down memory lane to see all the big hair and mullets as well.  Ha ha ha ...",1245542400,,3124,4.400696864111498
509992,5,6302779766,"Everything in this 1988 made-for-tv teen comedy starring Alyssa Milano, Tracey Gold and Christina Applegate works, including what doesn't; because it teaches life lessons all ages will learn from!  Matter of fact, that's what makes this movie ageless--it works for every age every hour and day of the week!  Better still, there's not a word of bad language in it!  Great escapist viewing, incredible humor and unbelievable depth that is perfectly captured on film and perfectly timed.  Movie will never ""Grow"" out of style!  Buy it today.

509994,4,6302779766,"I remember watching this movie as a 12 year old and I loved it! I think I watched it every weekend. I taped it off the tv! Wow!! It has a cast of all the 80's stars you remember with a ""bad acting"" set up but it is a great movie and I will still watch it often. (not every weekend though)",1204934400,,288,3.661290322580645

I first seen this movie many years ago on TV and found it highly entertaining and after seeing it once I wanted to own it and was happy to see it available on DVD.

7830997,3,6302779766,For me this movie was more about who was in it then anything else.  Anything with Christina Applegate is worth watching.  And she's been in some things like Kiss Of Fire that if she hadn't been in I wouldn't have watched at all.  And this was made in 1988 at the height of her and also  Alyssa Milano's 80s ishness.

7830999,4,6302779766,I love this movie but can someone...anyone tell me why this movie is so much? It is expensive every sight I get on. I have been wanting to see this movie again. Haven't seen it in years. I thought I would be able to get it for nothing..since its so old and it never came out in theaters. But my jaw just dropped when I saw what this movie was going for. I've seen it for several thousand dollars and I just don't get it. Even $46 for a used one is just too much. That's more than a New release movie on blu ray.,1376438400,,511,3.876190476190476

7831001,4,6302779766,"I remember seeing this movie on NBC in the late 80's.  My mom taped it.  My sister and I watched at least once a week, and then we loaned our movies to someone and their house burned down -- a lot of great old Disney vintage shows and old movies lost.  'Dance 'til Dawn' was among the tapes.

When the movie aired on TBS, I immediately located a blank tape and taped the whole movie (except for the commercials; Sixteen Candles, another great 80's movie aired that day).

As luck would have it, the tape was lost when my husband and I moved a few years ago.  I would love to have it on DVD - my husband has never seen it, but I can't afford to pay what they're asking.  Everyone was hit hard by the economy slump.

If they'd bring the price down, I'd be one of the first to order it.",1348790400,,783,4.038961038961039

I have bought movies that are better and more popular for much less. Even Wizard of Oz, which is a classic, is under $20. I will never pay this much for a single DVD... this is CRAZY pricing. Brian Bloom is super sexy in this movie but still not sexy enough to make me want to pay more than $25 for a DVD. $25 is even too high but doable.",1347321600,,492,3.881188118811881
