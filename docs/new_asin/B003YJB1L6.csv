8409384,5,B003YJB1L6,One of the greatest Bossa Nova women singers of Bossa Nova at the Lugano Jazz Festival concert. She sings her greatest hits at her best and she shows the power and beauty of brasilian jazz. Most of the songs written by Antonio Carlos Jobim.,1366588800,3,240,4.4772727272727275

Ably supported by a great band led by her son Marcello on bass, the music just graps you and enthralls you till the last note of the concert. The whole show/concert sleemed short because of the beauty of each number performed. It opened with Jobim's Aguas de Marco (Waters of March) then went through a very fluid and flowing session, the repertoire was just fantastic. It had some very human and warm moments too when Astrud visibly forgot or seemed to forget the lyrics of the song ""Dindi""but went on anyway with the reassuring backup of her band. There were smiles and laughters and cheers from the very rapt crowds. It's amazing how Astrud can sing the tough, tongue-twisting ""Telephone Song"" and stil have those words in English coming out loud and clear. I do not know of anyone else, to this date, who has recorded or performed this song in the speed and manner that Astrud does it. With her it all seems easy, flawlessly easy. True there are versions sung in Portuguese but in English? Try it. Type or read the words from paper and try singing it as fast as Astrud does and you'll come to a halt.

My other favorites are ""A Ra"" also recorded by Sergio Mendes & Brasil 66 under the title ""The Frog,"" and of course the ever nostalic ""Felicidade."" Paulo Jobim, son to the great Antonio Carlos Jobim, is cited here and his composition ""Milky Way"" is interpreted by Astrud in both English and Portuguese and shines glaringly.

For anyone into Brazilian music or Brazilian jazz, or Jobim, or Astrud or just good music, this one is a treasure, a definite ""keep!""

The DVD states this was recorded in 1985. It makes one wonder whether Astrud will perform again. But if and when she does, I can't wait for the DVD/CD release of it.",1284508800,,1845,4.517964071856287
8409386,5,B003YJB1L6,"If there was any question the beautiful Brazilian Diva Astrud Gilberto was not as talented as she was good looking, this video will prove that she was and is both.  The band is excellent featuring Piano, Bass, Trombone and Drums.  The instrumentalists are very talented and Astrud is in fine form, and I do mean fine singing old standards and new compositions to her credit by Paulo Jobim, son of Tom Jobim. Of course Girl From Ipanema, and Felicidade, Agua De Beber are all featured as well as other pop hits she had in the 60's including one she did with Stan Getz called the Telephone song.  This is a must have concert DVD from an Italian jazz festival from a city called Lugano.  I highly recommend it, thank you Astrud!",1284336000,,725,4.511450381679389
