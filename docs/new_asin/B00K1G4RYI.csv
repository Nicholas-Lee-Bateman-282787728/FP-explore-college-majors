6398402,3,B00K1G4RYI,I LOVE this show and was so happy to finally get Season 7. Previously I had bought Seasons 1 - 6 from Amazon UK and then bought an all-region DVD player and it worked out perfectly. I do think those versions are much better in terms of the quality of the packaging. Season 7 didn't have a episode listing or any descriptions. It's pretty much the case you see here and DVDs inside. A little disappointed.,1408924800,6,404,4.328947368421052

Show to bad they don't come on tv anymore the creator of this show should not have stopped it and then being a Without A Trace fan having to wait forever just to get these seasons has been such a pain in the rear I only need seasons 4 and 5 then I will have them all.

6398407,5,B00K1G4RYI,"Just a quick mention for fans from other parts of the world (such as myself): This US DVD release originating from the WBonline shop originally with conventionally pressed discs and later being put out as MOD (DVD-R on demand) plays on my Europen PS3 and is thus both compatible to region codes 1 (America) and 2 (Europe, Japan) and probably is to be considered region FREE. Just wanting to let anyone know who has been waiting for this getting a release somewhere for ages! This, by the way, is also the case for some other american Warner Bros home video releases I own...",1402963200,8,574,4.58252427184466
6398408,5,B00K1G4RYI,"WITHOUT A TRACE is in its seventh season and one would expect that the ideas portrayed by this fine series would begin to run thin. But not so. The cast -  Anthony LaPaglia, Poppy Montgomery, Enrique Murciano, Eric Close, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Roselyn Sanchez - remains stable, continuing to work under the original premise of the series: 'investigating missing property or deaths is comparatively easy compared to elusive missing people. However in New York City, there is a special unit of the FBI that is designed to find them. Using the vast resources of their bureau, the team, lead by Agent Jack Malone, race against time in the tight 72 hour window after a disappearance while hope for a recovery is still typically possible.'

The creative aspect of the series has been extended somewhat in that now some of the shows are written by cast members (such as Roselyn Sanchez) and some directed by others (as Eric Close).  The team is well directed by Anthony LaPaglia and the interaction among the cast members, predictable as that should be, often leads to subplots that involve the private lives f each of the characters. WITHOUT A TRACE  continues to be one of the consistently fine crime shows before the public today.  Grady Harp, January 11",1293840000,23,1252,4.886792452830188

6398412,4,B00K1G4RYI,I like this series. It talks about missing persons and how they get found and what their circumstances are.

It kept my interest and I will continue watching episodes from this series.,1485388800,,296,4.711538461538462

8655149,5,B00K1G4RYI,"I watched this show back when I had cable T.V. Unfortunately I became addicted. Years later I watch movies via streaming through Amazon. I was delighted to see all 7 seasons available. No commercials, no waiting a week for another slice of the lives of these men and women. This show follows the missing persons division of the F.B.I. which is made up. No missing persons division there. Missing persons division is in each state, law enforcement takes care of that. Each character has their own drama, in their own lives revealed over time, and through many flashbacks, which became all the rage at that period in T.V. land. These shows present a different missing person each episode. As family members or co-workers and others give eye witness testimony or their involvement, the team races to find the missing person. Some come out alive, others not so. There are many graphic scenes, sex, cursing and lewd scenes. Jack, the head of the team here always pushes, pulls, and does anything he wants to get information out of people. In this series everyone is guilty until mostly proven innocent. I would not want my child watching this show growing up thinking this is normal F.B.I behavior. Some of the shows take licence from the headlines. Human trafficking was in many of the shows. At times there are some very sweet and funny episodes but not much moral value here. Religion and Churches are made fun of and presented in a negative light sometimes. There are several romances here too but none seem too healthy to me. The show, to me, is mostly a guilty pleasure. Fun and interesting to see the hunt though. If you like C.S.I. and Criminal minds you will probably like this show. Series does end abruptly at season 7.",1524528000,,1725,4.71523178807947
