6382477,5,B00JP32KYM,"The story that Holcombe weaves together, of  building a future-facing a dark past-and struggle, is one of a cautionary nightmare styled by surreal horror. From start to finish City Of Lust creates a strong, chilling prose. The characters are twisted representations of over-exaggerated flamboyance. The most subdued and grounded character is the mousy Arianna. It as if all her world is developed of dreamlike perversions of her reality. This directorial style gives us a framework that manages to stay dark, even in its heightened theatrical state. The camp is even a sinister spin of hypnogogic that reminds me of a blend of cult-camp and Argentos, 80s giallo style. It could be off-putting but combined with the deep horror element, City Of Lust stays true to the genre.

The special effects is low budget, but done with enough care not to be seen as cheesy. Pretty much every scene where the blood flowed and the body dropped works in City Of Lust. Practical effects are used and used the way you expect in a film that is paying tribute to both the classic giallo styles while telling a timeless nightmare of personal transition of a character. There are visual effects that do enhance the surreal into areas of German expressionism, and the avant garde concept direction. Colors, stylized camera angles and shadowing keep everything in specific territory so some people may not get into City Of Lust. I loved it but these styles of storytelling hits my sweet spot in horror. A similar feel runs through Alyce Kills and I loved that film also. Sound effects and soundtrack are similar to classic horror films, creating a haunting, emotional atmosphere.

The sound effects offer short changes in attitude, raising the suspense of the film while the instrumental soundtrack creates a hypnotic pull. City Of Lust doesnt really give us anything new in these areas but the effects are used right, creating cool crescendos of emotional changes in the story. Thought went into how the sounds were used and when. This film could go either way with horror fans, those that get it get it and those that won't get won't get it. I found it to be a smart celebration of the elements of the giallo / arhouse horror styles, and gives us a nice bloody horror story with heart.",1431129600,,2264,4.829896907216495

6382479,4,B00JP32KYM,"From a certain perspective, this movie comes off as a cheap, trashy porn-wannabe with some suspense elements and really dull acting. While that never really changes through most of the runtime of this obviously budget movie, there is a little heart here and its fun in some unconventional ways. Rent it if you can find it.",1421280000,2,322,4.767857142857143

8652691,3,B00JP32KYM,"Arianna ( Margret Grace) is a confused cosmetologist who has moved to city leaving a ""bad situation"" which we see in her nightmares. Arianna is abused at work by her boss and has few friends, Renee (Kyle Greer) a gay cross dresser, and Jackie (Jill Oliver) a phone sex operator. Our heroine exhibits symptoms of formaldehyde poisoning such as nose bleeds. People in her work place start disappearing.

Jackie instructs Arianna to face her fears and that she ""has a right to be here."" We see her frequently waking up cowering in her closet and it isn't hard to figure out what was going on from what we see in her nightmares and the home scene.

They changed the title from ""Yellow"" to ""City of Lust."" Neither one was very good. While there was a mystery, it wasn't a very good one with limited characters and the main character lacking personality. The ending was dumb, but I had to laugh.
