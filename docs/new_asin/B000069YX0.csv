7965972,4,B000069YX0,"I have always wanted to play the guitar. I have had zero musical training. I bought 4 different DVD's, and watched many online instructional videos. This DVD has been the most helpful. Given my lack of a musical background, I go back and repeat the lessons over and over, but I am starting to get the hang of it. Basic things like finger placement, notes, chords, and tuning your guitar. You are not going to pick up an electric guitar and this DVD and sound like a rock star in a few weeks...I can see now it will take months or years of dedication to sound really good...but this is a great start!",1364428800,,599,4.3097345132743365
7965973,3,B000069YX0,"This is a basic video that gets a bit better as it goes along.
Everything is shown or discussed for a minute or two at most.

To start off, Paul tells you to tune your guitar to his - while he has heavy distortion effects on!

He then he starts ""teaching""...

- the blues riff used in ""bad to the bone""
- ""smoke on the water"" riff, not bad
- how to hold a pick like him
- a LZ riff
- what the names of the strings are
- ""satisfaction"" riff
- what the knobs on HIS amp do and how to get the sound that ""you"" want - on his amp
  Distortion is still maxed so the difference is minor.
- A bad version of an Aerosmith riff (""walk this way""?) using fingers 1 and 2 and some ""palm muting""
- how to read tablature (tab)
- a 2-note ""rage against the machine"" riff
- a way to memorize the notes on the top (E) string that is useless since all western music names notes with our alphabet from A to G
- how to memorize the frets so you can read tab - Hint:  the dot markers on pretty much any guitar's fret board are at 3, 5, 7, 9 and 12 //  The ""double dot"" one is at the 12th fret
- A VH riff using 5 Power Chords and a 2-finger movable chord shape
- What the knobs and switches on HIS electric guitar do, what pickups are...
- ""lightning crashes"" riff & notes on the A-string
- EC's ""cocaine"" riff.  This is probably my favorite thing he did.
- the ""ironman"" riff, not bad
- ""Drop D"" tuning
- ""alice in chains"" riff & a ""nirvana"" riff (meh)
- How to use an electronic tuner (...)
- ""enter sandman"" riff & the ""day tripper"" riff (not bad)
- How to tune your guitar (to itself) without a tuner
- How to stretch the strings to help keep the guitar in tune  (of course you should do this when you put new strings on...)
- ""crazy train"" riff & a SRV riff
- ""Wild thing"" using A, D and E chords.
- Tips for practicing chords and how to read a chord diagram
- ""Knocking on Heaven's Door"" - G, D, Am, & C [He finally turns the distortion off for this song]
- ""Sweet Home Alabama"" riff with ""Hammer-ons"" & ""pull-offs""
- Practice tips: practice slowly and in 5 or 10 minute intervals several times a day instead of hours at a time",1270166400,2,2111,3.902097902097902
7965974,5,B000069YX0,"I'm new to the guitar. Just picked one up for fun and to learn something new. I tried a couple of other videos that just didn't work very well. I finally came across this one by chance.

Within half an hour, I was suddenly cranking out a few popular chords. Paul Lidel speaks slowly, describes everything in detail, plays songs both fast (so you can hear and feel the tune) and then slowly so you can follow along and see his movements. I love that! He also takes the time to explain the little things that many over dvd's pass over.

The chords from song's he chooses are popular rock songs, not mary had a little lamb or other childrens songs.

My only gripe is that the dvd is ""short"" and doesn't really teach songs, only chords. I would love to have a dvd from him teaching entire songs, including hand holding me through the hard parts. I think this guy is a talented enough teacher (and obviously talented at guitar) to do it.

If you're new to guitar and like rock, I would highly recommend giving this a go.",1233619200,2,1015,4.326315789473684
7965975,5,B000069YX0,"This video is just what the doctor ordered to make beginning guitarists even more excited about learning guitar, even acoustic players. Not only does he cover the basics such as tuning and playing styles, amp effects, explaining the components of the guitar, but he also teaches you so much about chords, finding notes on the fretboard, and intersperses some cool riffs that we all recognize, note for note with ONSCREEN TAB, which so many other instructional videos sadly fail to provide. I myself and not a beginner, but I watched this with a youngster in the family whom I bought it for. Lidel's approach is perfect for any one who is just learning. He clearly recognizes the audience this was intended for without being disrespectful or condecsending. Fun and instructive at the same time - you can't beat that!",1137110400,,815,4.870503597122302
7965976,5,B000069YX0,"At 45, and not being musically inclined, but always having wanted to learn to play guitar, I bought my first guitar & amp.  After trying to play with my music store's DVD for two weeks I was about to give up.  Then, I saw Paul's Beginning Rock Guitar DVD and thought I'd give it one more chance.  What a life saver!  Paul must be one of the best guitar teachers out there.  This DVD totally rekindeled my interest, has me playing again on a regular basis and has me making plans to buy a better guitar.  Now I know I can do this.  Thanks Paul, you're awesome!  Rock on!",1080777600,5,569,4.155963302752293
7965977,5,B000069YX0,"I think all the reviews speak for themselves, so I'm just adding more praise on top of the other people's praise for this DVD.
I've never even held an electric guitar before but life's too short to not do what you always wanted to do and in my case it's play rock guitar so I decided to go for it. I bought a used standard black Fender Strat and then this DVD. I was amazed at how quickly I was playing actual, identifiable songs from some of my favorite rock groups. It was instant gratification.
I also liked how Paul Lidel was so clear and simple in his instructions. He has a very calm and patient demeanor about him. He also is obviously an awesome guitar player, if I could even get half as good as him I'd die happy. I wish he were my guitar teacher for private lessons!
If you've never played electric rock guitar before and can't afford private lessons, this is the best tool for you. Not only is it more encouraging to play actual cool songs instead of practice chords (not that that's not important) it's more fun too!",1074470400,12,1029,4.309278350515464
7965978,5,B000069YX0,"Since buying my first guitar a couple of months ago, I've bought about 20 DVD lessons.  As the title suggests, this DVD truly is a FUN approach.
The lessons themself are nothing special, very serious and straightforward, but the results are nothing short of amazing.  In the DVD you learn to play about 20 COOL guitar riffs.
The first time you crank out the intro to the Rolling Stone's ""Satisfaction"" in front of your friends and family, they will look around to see if you're actually playing it yourself.  It's a great feeling, and a great confidence builder for  beginners like me.",1032566400,38,585,4.705882352941177
7965979,5,B000069YX0,"This video is the bomb!  It goes over EVERYTHING one needs to know about playing the electric guitar, starting from the very basic to actual riff playing.  It is awsome!  The important stuff however, is too mixed in with the riff teaching.  You have to do a lot of rewinding, fast forwarding and note taking of the time that each section occures.  But it really wouldn't be fair if I rated this video based on its VHS format.  This really needs to be on DVD!",1006128000,4,458,4.329411764705882
7965980,4,B000069YX0,"Teach you some of the most important rock rift of all time show you to play the most rock popular power chord, how to tune your guitar, tricks and much more, you are a newbie and want to play tunes this is your video!",978998400,4,217,3.9545454545454546
