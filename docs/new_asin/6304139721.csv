786774,3,6304139721,"I was quite pleased with the quality of this production.  The animation is not nearly as refined as the work that may be found in those  short cartoons produced by Max Fleisher; however, it is still light years beyond  most of the cheap animation produced today.
  I was really pleased  with the initial flight sequences and the way super speed was presented.  Later on in the film, the flight scenes seem far less dramatic.  Also,  there are a few points where the art work simply seems crude.  What this  film may lack in graphics is more than made up by a very original and  concise telling of Superman's origin.
  The origin story of Supeman,  sole survivor from the doomed planet Krypton, has been told quite a number  of times in both comics and film.  This version expands greatly upon the  original (and all too brief) origin story provided by Jerry Siegal and Joel  Shuster.  It also deviates dramatically from the retelling presented much  later by John Byrne.  In my opinion, this origin story is in many ways  superior to Byrne's.
  Without giving too much away, Byrne presented  Krypton as a planet populated by a race of cold, unemotional beings.  The  animated version presents the Kryptonians as being a far more human like  race.  While this may lack scientific credability, it certainly makes it  easier for the viewer to feel sympathy for the plight of Jor-El who must  send his son off to another world.
  Dini and company do decide to  follow Byrne's lead and keep Clark Kent's adopted parents alive.  This  makes perfect sense to me.  Superman is a very up beat character.  Why  impose gloom and doom on him? After all, he is not Bruce Wayne.
  Brainiac is given an entirely new origin story in this film.  It is  chilling.  In fact, I hope that Warner Brothers will make the Braniac  episodes available sometime in the future.  His (or ITs) appearance here is  all too brief.
  Fans of H.P. Lovecraft should pay close attention to  the scene following the action in the ice cavern.  There is a very brief  allusion to _At the Mountains of Madness_.
  There is, of course,  quite a bit of gunfire. This is to be expected in a film about a man who is  bullet proof.  It does not bother me, but it may concern some parents.
  Overall, it is a lot of fun.  I think quite a number of adults will  appreciate it as much if not more than their kids.  Some of the humour is  obviously directed at an older crowd.  At one point Lois Lane gazes at a  photographic image of Superman.  She quips, ""Nice 'S'.""
Regards  and Best Wishes,

786874,5,6304139721,My son loved the movie. It gave him the background on what happened to Krypton and Superman's escape from Krypton as a baby. Questions he's asked me about but that I couldn't remember the answers to from my childhood.,1188518400,,217,4.589743589743589

786876,5,6304139721,"Although the DC live-action adaptations have generally lagged well behind the Marvel adaptations, in the animation field DC wins hands-down.  ""Superman: Last Son Of Krypton"", my personal favorite of the 'movie/tv' chronicles of the Man Of Steel is a stellar example of this.  Like the Batman animated material, the animated Superman has admittedly been simplified and, to a lesser degree than Batman, toned down for the younger audience, but remains a faithful, spirit-capturing translation of the epic Superman comics.  Unique animation style, tremendous scenes combining action and drama magnificently (including the legendary 'airplane-save' scene), and some of storytelling's alltime best characters add up to a great movie, one that, in my opinion, surpasses the ongoing animated series that followed it.  The voice actors aren't who I would have picked for the parts - they sound utterly nothing like the characters I hear when I read the books, although admittedly that's a pretty subjective standard to judge on, with probably almost everybody who reads a tale in comic book format, novel format, or whatever hearing the voices differently - but they do indeed turn in good performances and prove worthy interpretors of their parts.  Highly recommended for everybody; suitable for tots but DEFINATELY not a 'kids-only' picture; great stuff, overall almost on par with the best Superman comics.",1100217600,12,1401,5.43778801843318
786877,5,6304139721,"What a great episode to open one of the best animated superhero runs!!!.

786878,5,6304139721,This is the 90 minute pilot to the Superman cartoon series from Warner Brothers. The story is excellent. I am very pleased with the care that was taken in trying to retell the original Superman legend making it identifiable for adults and interesting for kids. The entire series was well produced and I sincerely hope that someday the series will be available as a DVD boxed set.,1039651200,3,379,4.6716417910447765
786879,3,6304139721,"Superman: The Last Son of Krypton is the first three episodes of the acclaimed animated series that ran on KidsWB! in the late 90's. As became par for the WB marketing department, rather than give fans fresh Superman material, they were content to edit and repackage episodes together into ""movies"". The resulting video is worth your attention and collection, but it's not a movie, and it's nowhere near the best that the series had to offer.
Superman: LSK was produced by Bruce Timm, Paul Dini, and the many talented people that created Batman: The Animated Series, and later, Batman Beyond and Justice League. While the group has had no problems with Batman, they never quite got the hang of Superman, and it's evident in these episodes. Like Richard Donner's 1978 Superman movie, the origin of Superman is told in three distinct parts: Starting on Krypton, we learn of the planet's demise and follow scientist Jor-El as he rockets his son to Earth. We see Clark grow up in Smallville and learn of his heritage, then we move on to Metropolis and the introduction of Lois Lane, the Daily Planet, and Lex Luthor. The scenes on Krypton are the best part of the ""movie"". In a wise move, the villain Brainiac is re-imagined as Krypton's supercomputer, and lets everyone die so it can save itself.
Kal-El is rocketed to Earth, and the ""movie"" starts going downhill. Too little time is spent on Clark finding out about his powers in Smallville. I would've liked to see more of Lana Lang, and more of Clark gradually accepting that he's different. The story skips by these important scenes too quickly as it moves us to Metropolis. Lex Luthor has designed a prototype battle suit that is appearantly stolen by terrorist John Corben. Too much time is spent on this plot thread, and at times it overwealms Superman's introduction to the citizens of Metropolis. I would've liked to see more of a shock among the bad guys when they find out they're being chased by a flying man, Superman's interview with Lois, and the scene of Superman finding acceptance after his final victory is too short. The fight sequences go on a tad too long, and Superman is knocked about repeatedly until he suddenly cuts loose and finishes the fights in a matter of seconds. Worst of all, the ""movie"" ends with the foreshadowing of the return of Brainiac. Nothing wrong with that, but it only makes sense in the context of the entire series. Fans who haven't seen the other episodes will be left hanging.
Despite all this, there are also many positives. All the characterization is dead on, from eager Jimmy Olsen to hardened Perry White, Lana Lang, Jor-El, and especially the three big stars, Clark, Luthor, and Lois. While actors Tim Daly and Clancy Brown are still struggling with their voices here, they find themselves by the third episode's end, and give great performances.
For those wanting to watch a ""movie"", try the ""Batman-Superman Movie"". It's the only other three episodes of the Superman series released, but its story is more self-contained and more enjoyable. Superman: The Last Son of Krypton is not the best introduction the character could've recieved, but it's still an important part of the series, and essential viewing.",1026604800,16,3212,4.841818181818182

I love this movie because it's a Superman story told through a visual medium.  As a fan of Superman and animation I can safely say this movie captures  the true spirit of Superman.  The movie is mostly action, but drama is  incorporated throughout the story.
The film deals with the destruction  of Krypton, Clark Kent in high school, and Superman's first romps through  Metropolis.

7862332,5,6304139721,"This DVD contains Superman's origin story, starting  with his birth on the doomed planet Krypton, and during 61 minutes, grows up in Smallville, graduates, moves to Metropolis, deals with Brainiac, and fights Lex Luthor.

If you own, or plan to own, the animated series, you don't need to buy this, because what I describe above comprises the first three episodes of the animated series, first aired in 1996.

There's not much else I can say without giving away details of the actual plot. It is a very good retelling of the Superman story, and gives us some interesting things to consider, like can a computer be too smart for our good.

Shortcoming: This DVD does not give us much about Luthor's origin. That might have been covered in other episodes of the series.

Over the years, people have often wondered, why didn't the Kryptons believe the scientist Jor-el. This film does a nice job of that, showing how the Kryptonian computer, Brainiac, deceived the council by reassuring them that all was well, so they never had time to try any solutions like building ships or even projecting everyone into the Phantom Zone

SPECIAL FEATURES

When you watch the special features, be sure that you get to see all the content. The first special feature is ""Superman: Family, Friends & Foes"". The menu for this SF starts with PLAY ALL, then lists the available topics. If you select Play All, you just get the videos for each character. If you individually select each person or couple, you also get a biographical screen and voiceover talking about that person or couple. I discovered this by accident, because I usually trust that ""Play All"" indeed contains all. But I won't cut them down for this production mistake.

I highly recommend this compilation of three episodes of the animated series to all Superman fans, especially those who, like me, love origin stories.

7862333,5,6304139721,"Superman and his story are known to people across America and the world.  So, when faced with the challenge of giving the Man of Steel's origin a new and fresh look that can still be respected, creators Alan Burnett, Paul Dini, and Bruce Timm rose to the occasion.  This Superman was new but not out-of-line with the character we've come to know and love.  It's definitely less campy than the first two Superman movies with Christopher Reeve, though that's kind of like comparing apples and oranges as both versions are still great.  This television pilot gave us a great story and set up a lot of cliff-hanger plot points for future episodes, all of which were definitely reasons to stick around and watch the series.  Overall, a great pilot to a great television show for Superman fans young and old.  I will say I did like the more confident Clark Kent and it was nice to see Superman using his x-ray vision for something useful...in the movies, it always seemed like he was using it more to show it off...I don't recall him ever using it to find someone or anything else like that.  But again, the Superman films are great, this series is great, and Superman is great.  This television pilot ought to be a welcome addition for any Superman fan's collection.

Why buy this when you can buy the entire first season for about the same price?  Don't get me wrong, as a ""movie"" it does work and is actually one of the best and most sympathetic versions of the Superman story covering Superman's arrival, a glimpse into his teenage years, and ending with his introduction to Metropolis.

7862336,5,6304139721,"I still prefer the 1978 Christopher Reeve Superman movie to this, but for a pilot episode for an animated series, I found this one to be quite enjoyable. And there were a couple of things I liked better about this version like the introduction of Brainiac. Plus you also get more insight into Krypton's society than in any of the other Supermans, and you also get a little more on-screen time with Superman's birth parents. Those things are what really makes this animated version so good.

Superman's home planet Krypton is dying, and their lead scientist, Jor-El (Superman's father), is attempting to warn the planet's leaders of the threat, but no one will listen to him because Brainiac, Krypton's all-knowing computer, says there is nothing to worry about. Jor-El, knowing that Brainiac is lying, tries to find out why Brainiac would say such a thing. Hacking into Brainiac's systems, Jor-El discovers that Brainiac is downloading himself into a satellite in order to save himself. Brainiac orders the police to arrest Jor-El. Evading capture, Jor-El returns home and sends his only child and infant son into a small spaceship and launches it towards Earth just as Krypton explodes.

Arriving on Earth, Jor-El's son is adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent. They decide to name the boy Clark. As Clark Kent grows he realizes he has amazing powers that he decides to use to protect mankind. Moving to Metropolis, Clark gets a job at the Daily Planet newspaper and meets the beautiful female reporter Lois Lane. Superman makes his presence known and must stop a group of terrorists who have stolen LexCorp's new high-tech battle suit. Superman suspects that LexCorp's CEO, Lex Luther, may know more about the theft than he's saying. Now it's up to Superman to save the day.

The episode ends with a group of aliens in deep space picking up the Brainiac's satellite. Brainiac kills the alien crew, takes over their ship, and sets a course for Earth.

In all, I say this film was pretty entertaining, and considering that its just over an hour long, they managed to fit in quite a bit of material. Highly recommended!",1288742400,,2116,4.8694444444444445
