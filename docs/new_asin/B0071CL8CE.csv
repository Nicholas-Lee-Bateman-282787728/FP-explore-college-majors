The other DVDs I've purchased work great (the Buck Jones DVDs - Rough Rider ones...) I've tried to figure out how to exchange it for another Good Copy on line but can't. I don't want to call to find out how, it's too much bother for a $5.95 item. Sometimes you get what you pay for...  I just placed another order for some more DVDs, paying more for them this time hoping for better quality...",1526083200,,496,4.333333333333333

8508251,5,B0071CL8CE,"Granted, Col. Tim McCoy made a boatload of B westerns across his career.  But he was always the handsome hero, wearing a ten (or twenty) gallon hat bigger than Hedda Hopper's.  He was particularly graceful in the saddle and had a clever habit of twirling his guns as he reholstered them.  This Tim McCoy film has only recently been re-released.  A collector's find for sure!",1344988800,,374,4.707692307692308
