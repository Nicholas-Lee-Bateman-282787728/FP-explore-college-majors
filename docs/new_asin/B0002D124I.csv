8026449,2,B0002D124I,"I can believe I wasted my $$$$ buying the ""Complete Ruger .22 Pistol MK I, II, 22/45 DVD by CLARK Custom Guns. The only gun dismantled was a ""Customized"" Mark I. Completely worthless if you own a 22/45 (there are some differences to interior parts).Very poor video technique when it comes to the ""complete"" Disassembly/Reassembly of the pistol. Video close-ups completly out of focus and blurry making very difficult to see all of the small parts being removed or re-installed. The verbal instructions from the gunsmith (Tommy Bison), mumbling the words out thru the whole presentation, is very boring and very difficult to understand, it seems like he had to be prompted by the camera operator many times in order to clarify what he's trying to explain. Truly a terrible presentation.
Beside Tommy, the rest of this DVD is good and so are the other gunsmiths explaining and showing you step-by-step instructions on how-to completely disassemble and reassemble the pistol.",1207008000,7,972,5.08125
