8346434,3,B001VH7ADG,So animation is great! All the audio is terrible... voices are annoying and the music is pretty basic. I was expecting a lot more:(,1495238400,,131,4.5
8346435,1,B001VH7ADG,"I did not like this DVD at all.....at ALL!  It is although, true to it's title and the people who made it did an excellent job. I just was not expecting what I saw. I would recommend it to anyone whom, of course is interested in this sort of animation.",1243641600,,252,4.04
8346436,5,B001VH7ADG,"This dvd lives up to its title. It's very bizarre and disturbing in some sequences. I felt that the Sushi films in particular were reminiscent of Svankmajer's short films (though less political).  Chicago Dracula was more of an 80's style saturday morning cartoon and Human Experiments was like a cgi mad max.  The why not short bordered on depressing, as it involved numerous references to necrophilia. Very eclectic, and not for all tastes, but artistic nonetheless.",1240790400,5,468,5.144736842105263
8346437,5,B001VH7ADG,"The DVD cover art caught my eye, and I decided to give it a try.  There wasn't much of a budget involved (obviously), but what this filmmaker was able to do without any money was absolutely remarkable.  I'd recommend this title for any fan of obscure animation or anyone that wants to see what can be done if you simply put your mind to it.

My personal favorite was Chicago Dracula - a very bizarre cartoon reminiscent of ""Count Duckula"" with a touch of ""Ren and Stimpy.""

Pick up a copy if you want to be entertained (while supporting independent cinema).",1240704000,5,557,4.485148514851486
8346438,1,B001VH7ADG,"This looked interesting when Amazon sent it to me as a ""recommened"" video. This is the worst pile of poop I had ever seen. I am now little dumber for having watched this. Of no value whatsoever. Poor quality, no story or plot, and not even of artistic value. Looks like a project from an elemantary school class, jumbled & unprofessional. I would resell this dvd on Amazon, but I would feel bad to do this to another person. Thumbs down.",1240185600,2,437,4.407407407407407
