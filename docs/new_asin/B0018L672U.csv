8269961,1,B0018L672U,Extremely poor picture quality. Looks like a bootleg copy of the original film. Not worth buying. The original film is good,1397779200,2,123,4.904761904761905
8269962,3,B0018L672U,"The Fighting Lady is a great documentary and has amazing color footage aboard a WWII aircraft carrier, but the picture quality of this copy (by Periscope Film) is very poor. I have seen three versions of this film and Zeno's Flight Shop has by far the best picture and sound quality on their version. This version looked like it was taped off of theirs and then recorded again.",1334707200,3,377,4.5588235294117645
8269963,5,B0018L672U,"I have a relative who served on the first USS Yorktown (CV-5) which was sunk during the early, dark days of the Pacific Front, and it was good to see and remember the honor bestowed on that ship's memory by her successor, numbered CV-10 and now docked as a museum in Charleston, SC. The tragic ""life and death"" of the USS Hornet (CV-8) was good addition to the DVD and also important history for those who need to learn more about the deadly and protracted war on the Pacific Front of WWII. The Hornet had a ""successor"" also, which was able to finish the war and thensome. The fact that Edward Steichen, one of our greatest photographers, was the director for ""The Fighting Lady"" is a bonus.",1300233600,4,691,4.448818897637795
8269964,4,B0018L672U,"My father was a plank owner from the commissioning of the second USS Yorktown CV-10 in 1943.  He and his shipmates endured ten naval battles in the Pacific theatre onboard the Yorktown to the end of World War II.  This presentation has more actual combat footage of the Yorktown that I have ever found available.  The transfer of video, and audio to DVD is very clean.",1232150400,10,368,4.545454545454546
8269965,1,B0018L672U,This DVD is a piece of junk. It looks like someone taped the History Channel and then burned a DVD on his computer. Only the first segment would play and all of the footage was so dark you couldn't see it. I have seen this same footage in other programs and it was crystal clear. I was hoping to get a title with some interesting WWII carrier action and all I got was taken. I returned it that day.,1193443200,,398,4.050632911392405
