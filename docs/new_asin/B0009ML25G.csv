8063258,3,B0009ML25G,"Vince Russo and Ed Ferrara were two of the more polarizing figures during the mid to late 90's and into the last days of WCW. From the attitude era of WWF, to bursting onto the scene in WCW in the fall/winter of WCW in '99, these two usually were either loved or loathed by fans and those in the business alike. Since then both have worked in TNA and this DVD done back in 2005 is an inside look at the WWF from the perspectives of Ferrara and Russo, while being interviewed by Wade Keller of PWITORCH.com.

They tackle a variety of topics from how they both grew up being fans of the business, how they both broke into it (had no idea Ferrara was once an indy wrestler), the events that took place to where Russo became part of the writing team, how Ed came in later and they became friends. We hear about everything from Austin and Rock's rise to main event status, how Hogan's heel turn influenced change in WWF's product, how interviews changed and that roles of good vs. bad being thrown out the window, the Montreal Screwjob, Owen Hart's death (which was a touching portion of the feature) and more subjects.

It was refreshing to hear from both these guys as both seem honest and candid and Russo doesn't come off as egotistical as he has been portrayed by others in the past, Ed seemed like a genuine guy, who still loves wrestling to this day. It was nice to get a different view of the WWF from someone not employed by them, though this DVD isn't without its problems.

1: The cheap production value, I mean this is like college TV studio type production, which made me laugh more often than not.

2. The interview segment is quite long (just over 2 hours) which isn't bad mind you, but it's hard to watch it straight through as its just talk, (good talk but still just talk).

3: As good as it is to hear from both guys, there's no replay value in this, the interview portion is well done but the shock is gone and the stories become stale with a second viewing.

4. The extras aren't worth much, we see Ed and Vince at an indy event helping with booking, footage of Ed as a wrestler and a few other things.

So overall if you're a wrestling fan this is worth viewing once, its again nice to hear from both guys especially Vince who has received far more scorn from people (some deservedly and some undeserved in my opinion). Just a one time watching experience to me.",1354406400,,2379,4.344594594594595
8063259,5,B0009ML25G,I enjoyed this DVD and the look at the inside of Wrestling and what goes into putting on a weekly show.  It gives you a better understanding of what goes on backstage and how hard it is to work with Vince McMahon.  Wade Keller did a great job during the interview and the fans  have a better understanding on what went on in WWE during the Additude era.  I highly recommend this DVD if your a fan of wrestling.,1297814400,,410,4.151898734177215
8063260,3,B0009ML25G,"It's true that this interview looks really low budget.  It's kind of odd that they had enough money to fly Russo and Ferrara somewhere to film this, and then really half assed the production.  This didn't bother me too much, as I was more interested in what they had to say.  There is some interesting stories inside here, though they are a bit dated by now.

Russo often interrupts Ed which gets kind of annoying, and he constantly says something like ""This is what people don't realize"" or ""This is what people don't know"". But, he tells some interesting backstage stories on how The Rock started talking in the third person, that Russo didn't think the New Age Outlaws would work, and the last section is their take on Owen Hart's death.

I guess my main gripe with the DVD is that it's too short.  Yes, it is two hours long, but since there is virtually no replay value in this, it would have been nice had they gone at least twice as long as this.  Still though, if you were a fan of the WWF Attitude Era, it's interesting to watch if you can pick it up for a few bucks.",1296172800,,1075,4.292079207920792
8063261,4,B0009ML25G,"I have never liked Vince Russo and I have always heard bad things about Ed Ferarra that made me dislike him (like the idea that he made fun of Jim Ross' Bells palsy disease on tv). I had no desire to get this dvd, but for this price, I decided to check out what they had to say. Like them or not, they were the head writers for the company that rose from the ashes to overtake WCW and have one of the biggest surges in popularity in the history of the sport.

By the end of the dvd, you get the idea that these guys were fans of wrestling, but were just worked to death and given little credit for the effort they had put forth. They talked frankly about the superstars of the time, the top being Stone Cold Steve Austin and the Rock. Really fun walk dowb memory lane and some interesting insight on how it would be to work for the McMahons. By the end of the dvd, I didn't hate these guys anymore and had more of an idea of where they were coming from when they left the company.",1204848000,3,980,4.0256410256410255
8063262,2,B0009ML25G,"First of all, this is a very cheaply made DVD.  The ""studio"" looked like some college dropout's first studio apartment.

The interview is very long -- you can see the interviewer's facial hair becoming fuller as it progresses -- but covers surprisingly little ground.  It cuts off abruptly before Russo answers the first question about WCW and prompts you to buy the next DVD in the series to get the rest of the interview.  The interviewer spends an inordinate amount of time probing Owen Hart's death, asking Russo and Ferrara in about a dozen different ways whether they think the show should have gone on.  They said that's what Owen would have wanted, but the interviewer keeps badgering them about it.

Russo is a brash guy and obviously loves to be talking on camera (but for the record, he denies that he enjoyed putting himself at the center of attention on WCW's programming).  Ferrara is visibly irritated by Russo's interruptions and subtlely domineering attitude throughout the interview, but Ferrara has little of anything of interest to add to Russo's commentary.

Some of Russo's stories are interesting, but anything he says must be taken with a large block of salt.  Russo lied to people he worked with, screwed Terry Bollea (and Hulk Hogan) and many other superstars, and recklessly led WCW on a self-destructive path.  Russo complains that wrestling had lacked ""reality,"" so his idea of interjecting ""reality"" into WCW was to (literally) throw the title belts in the trash and tell the stupid marks who bought into their prestige that they never meant anything anyway.  His idea of ""realistic"" storylines was to have wrestlers pretend that they are deviating from the script and ""shooting.""  Hogan even wrestled briefly as ""Terry Bollea"" -- which was strange since he was always referred to publicly as Hulk Hogan, even in non-wrestling situation.  If becoming the evil ""Hollywood Hogan"" didn't ruin his legacy with the fans, then becoming a hapless regular-guy ""Terry Bollea"" should have.  Russo apparently never bothered to realize that since the fake ""shoot"" storylines he concoted are themselves scripted, there was no sense of reality to which fans could relate and no reason for them to care about self-consciously fake matches.  People watch wrestling for the same reason people watch movies -- because they are willing to suspend their disbelief, not because they want to have their disbelief indulged.

One funny moment in the interview is when Russo says that the only people who still believe wrestling is real are the wrestlers themselves.  Look at the way Bret Hart reacted when Vince McMahon screwed him out of his WWF title (it's just a fake title, Bret!).  Look at the Ultimate Warrior, who actually changed his legal name to Warrior.  Vince McMahon actually punishes wrestlers for infractions by denying them title shots, because they actually crave the glory that they think will be theirs with a ""fake"" title.  Look at all the politics that goes on backstage about ""creative control"" and such...yeah, wrestlers think that what they do is all real.

Russo and Bischoff ran WCW like a couple of spoiled brats, clueless about how the real world works.  They spent lavishly and wasted millions of dollars on talent such as Bret Hart (whom they never used productively).  Hulk Hogan was interesting the first few months of his nWo turn, but quickly became as stale and even more predictable than the 80s Hogan.  ""Hollywood Hogan"" -- billed as the biggest icon in wrestling -- didn't have a single good wrestling match there.  They had him job to an out-of-shape Roddy Piper's weak sleepr hold repeatedly.  Besides defeating Sting for a 1-2-3 in a botched match that was nonsensically restarted by Bret Hart so Sting could win, I don't think he won a single match as nWo Hollywood cleanly -- this, a man who was once virtually unbeatable.  As a result, there was no sense of competitive drama about his matches, a basic requirement of a main event.  Hogan's wrestling just stank.  Yet he was capable of performing in the ring, as he finally would with the Rock at WrestleMania, much to fans' delight.

Since the collapse of WCW, WWE has come to realize that fans want more than just microphone antics and sexual shenanigans...that while they want to be entertained, they still want good wrestling, too.  WWE does let wrestlers ""shoot"" when the show's over and even has them shoot about wrestling on their own DVDs.  But for the most part, they keep kayfabe when they're in the ring, though sometimes the storylines the writers feed them are so absurd, it's difficult to do.  But just like an actor stays in character when he's on stage even though the audience knows he's just an actor, a wrestler who steps out of character can ruin the show.

Bischoff and Russo seemed out to destroy the wrestling business itself.  Bischoff proved that any idiot can succeed, for a while, if he's given access to Ted Turner's pocketbook.  But Russo proved -- and on this interview basically admits -- that Vince McMahon, for all his faults, is the master, and Russo was just the apprentice.  Russo screwed so many people at WCW and did so many shameless and sordid things in his desperate attempts to rule wrestling, that he begged God for forgiveness and recently became a born-again Christian.  Russo may think he can save himself, but he can't save the ruined legacy of WCW.",1137542400,10,5396,4.889010989010989
8063263,4,B0009ML25G,"Being a big mark for Vince Russo, I really enjoyed this 3 disc set. The first disc features Vince and Ed in a tell all interview about their time in the WWF. Find out how they got in the company, how much power they had, How Austin, Rock and Triple H were behind the scenes, Survivor Series 97 with Bret Hart, Their feelings on Owen Hart and so much more.

On disc 2, they talk about their time in WCW. Find out what they wanted to do but were not able to, who they saw potential in, working with Eric Bischoff, putting the WCW Title on David Arquette and a lot more.

Disc 3 is one on one questions with them. See what they have to say about the WWF buying WCW, TNA, If they would ever go back to WWE and more.

There is also an extra feature where they are backstage at a SCCW show and script promos for the wrestlers. Also, 3 matches from that SCCW So Cal Super Card in 2004.

Psicosis vs. TJ Boy.

Chris Bosh vs. Super Dragon.

Big Q/Kenny King vs. Cyrus/Plague.",1129507200,3,966,4.084656084656085
8063264,5,B0009ML25G,"I've been a wrestling fan for many years and I'm always looking for some inside ""scoop"" on the WWF and WWE.  Well, the ULTIMATE INSIDERS V.1 has the most inside info I have ever seen or read anywhere!  You'll be amazed at some of the stories these guys reveal.  I'll never look at wrestling the same again.  This is a MUST for the true fan!!!",1124928000,,342,4.2153846153846155
8063265,5,B0009ML25G,"This is the perfect example of one of those ""books you just can't put down"" when watching the DVD. There's just so much information to soak up and really watch again and again, because maybe you missed something the first time around when you were just watching to watch. Torch Editor Wade Keller did a phenomenal job hosting the DVD. When talking to Ed Ferrara about the DVD project, he explained to me that he didn't think he would ever do this type of interview unless Wade was hosting. I believe that's a testament the reputation of professionalism and ""doing your homework"" that Wade has built up for the Torch that has earned the respect from the wrestling community.

The depth of coverage of the DVD is phenomenal and certainly worth a buy.",1116374400,6,748,4.62406015037594
