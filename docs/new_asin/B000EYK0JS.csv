8115859,3,B000EYK0JS,"I first watched Raqia Hassan's choreography to the same music, which was fantastic and which I danced, so I wanted to compare and eventually learn a new version to dance it too some day but I was very disappointed. I guess it reflects the choreographer's mood and personality but this choreography looks messy and sometimes out of place, like when Nourhan uses her hands like guns that she pulls out of imaginary pockets and shoots! Not very tasteful for this classical music.
A lot of people may find it overpriced, as other Yousry Sharif's videos.
Otherwise the DVD is well made, with clear instruction, it is just the choreography that I didn't like.",1217376000,,653,4.787610619469026
