4043154,5,B0030BS1FM,"This program is the use of CGI at its finest;  not only the hear the description, but to see the continental shelf, the deeps of the Pacific from the air, in almost 3D quality is amazing.  To look down in one segment and see an aircraft flying along the sheer drop to the ocean floor for what seems miles and miles is fantastic!",1274659200,36,328,4.190476190476191
4043155,5,B0030BS1FM,"Saw this on cable and had to order. Immagine the oceans are gone and then study the earth. It makes the geology of the planet more complete and allows a perspective that is very satisfying.

Excellent program. You cannot go wrong.",1263081600,31,230,4.609756097560975

4043196,5,B0030BS1FM,Absolutely fascinating.  Can't wait to get 'Draining the Great Lakes.'  The perspective of our planet and how it lives and breathes is life-changing.  Truly a deeper look at the amazing Mind behind the intricate details our Creator designed into making a habitat for humans and life on planet earth.,1419724800,,299,5.061224489795919

4043201,5,B0030BS1FM,"We've watched this several times. Why wasn't science this much fun when I had to study it in school? This would make a good classroom tool, but it's still an excellent documentary to watch at home.",1410480000,,197,4.5

4043204,5,B0030BS1FM,What a fascinating show this is. When you see how this whole planet fits together it is mind boggling and wonderful. National Geographic let's us see so much of what we would never see otherwise. You will love it.,1398643200,,213,4.487179487179487
4043205,5,B0030BS1FM,An excellent video about the ocean and what it encompasses. A great video for students and adults alike. Made me want to learn more about our lovely planet's oceans.,1390003200,2,165,4.724137931034483
4043226,4,B0030BS1FM,I thought this was fascinating. God Created the world and everything in it in 7 days. He certainly knew what he was doing.,1381104000,,122,4.3478260869565215

4043229,5,B0030BS1FM,Spectacular filming & effects. This is an amazing well thought out documentary. Gave it as a gift to my son,1360886400,,107,4.4

to watch it without going to sleep but I could not.
I tried multiple times",1360108800,,124,4.208333333333333
4043231,5,B0030BS1FM,"I purchased this after watching the program on television. This should be a ""must-see"" in any high school or college course on earth sciences, geology, plate tectonics, climate, etc. Now if National Geographic would just put ""Drain the Great Lakes"" on DVD...",1360022400,,258,5.166666666666667
4043232,5,B0030BS1FM,"National Geographic's ""Drain The Ocean"" is an outstanding documentary! As a science buff, I never saw anything like it before.  For the first time, computer images show you what the earth would like if there were no oceans.  The computer images look real; for instance, the scientists walking around the famous ""smokers"" or standing on the edge of a cliff, hundreds of feet down below the shoreline and a plane flying thousands of feet even further!  The science involved in this is remarkable documentary gives you a full love and appreciation of our oceans, for without them, life on Earth would not be at least desirable.  Drain The Ocean should be in everyone's library.",1355616000,9,674,4.885964912280702
4043233,5,B0030BS1FM,I saw this on Nat Geo and know my sister and brother in law would love it.  They watch very little TV so small chance they would catch it.,1354838400,,138,3.7586206896551726
4043234,2,B0030BS1FM,"thought it would have been more in depth of the ocean floor, instead it was a lot of talking, they dropped the ocean level several times instead of all at once and being able to look at all of floor at once. bought for myself and my kids ages 8 and 10, they found it boring.",1354147200,,274,3.9107142857142856
4043235,3,B0030BS1FM,I bought this to help teach my 5th graders about the ocean floor. The graphics are good but it is a little dry for students.,1338163200,,124,4.0
4043246,5,B0030BS1FM,"As an educator, I am always searching for new visuals. My students really responded well to this dvd and were engaged watching it. It explains plate tectonics in a big picture sense which helped many of the students. I am very pleased with this purchase.",1337904000,12,254,4.666666666666667
4043247,3,B0030BS1FM,"a dvd format only? How come it did not have a Blu Ray Version, dissappointed though specially coming from NG!",1337472000,,109,4.5
4043248,5,B0030BS1FM,I had seen only a part of this on tv. and really wanted to see the rest of it. For me it was all quiet and lights out. A wonderful film!!!,1336003200,,138,3.4838709677419355
4043249,5,B0030BS1FM,I use this DVD to show my students the geology landforms beneath our oceans surface.  Many students don't realize what is there and this opens their eyes to an incredible world beneath the ocean surface but also allows them to see the many opportunities in science related fields that they could study.  Great DVD!,1319673600,,314,4.796296296296297
4043250,5,B0030BS1FM,This is an ingredible dvd. Loved it and want to buy for my father but I need it in Blue Ray please.,1295136000,,99,3.5454545454545454
4043251,1,B0030BS1FM,After reading the other reviews here I was hopeful and excited to see this.  I was really looking for something to show my intro geology classes regarding the sea floor and all of the interesting areas and details of it.  Boy was I disappointed.  I found the overall presentation very dry and convoluted.  The graphics are nice but they are not shown with the greatest impact.  Out of the 90 minutes of video I may use about 12-20 minutes of it.  There are much better videos out there that do a much better job at giving the science of what is going on in different locations of our sea floor.  I feel they just got too overdramatic with the information and too caught up in the CGI graphics and didn't give good easy to follow information.  I'm sure this will appeal to certain audiences but it really didn't appeal to me or hit what I wanted to use it for.  I am disappointed with what I think they could have done which would have been to couple the amazing graphics with straight forward easy to follow science.,1293926400,13,1016,4.390374331550802
4043252,4,B0030BS1FM,"National Geographic revolutionizes the perception that the public had about the oceans, until the release of this documentary.  Beautiful photography, interviews with scientists/explorers, and stunning computer-generated imagery, render some justice to a world that still needs to deliver many secrets to humanity.  Hopefully, humanity will learn from history, geology, and this media production, how many benefits it has to gain from managing the resources of the oceans responsibly.",1289779200,7,484,6.102941176470588
4043253,5,B0030BS1FM,"As the oceans are peeled away like layers of an an onion and using real and computer generated data, you can see what is under the sea. And to gain a better perspective of the undersea, unseen world, portions are compared to familiar landmarks such as the Grand Canyon.

Enlightening, educational and entertaining, this is a great work by National Geographic.",1280534400,5,359,4.885245901639344
4043254,5,B0030BS1FM,An amazing piece of work. Beautiful CGI and new insights to the development and everconstant changes happening to our planet. This kind of presentation calls to mind the question as to whether these changes can actually be random changes or finely-tuned planning to support advanced life forms.,1279584000,2,294,5.276595744680851
4043255,4,B0030BS1FM,I watch a lot of nature documentaries.  This is one of the best.  What it conveys is the enormous depth of the underwater landscapes. The computer animation is amazing.  An important point to keep in mind is that we still have a lot to learn about the deep sections of the ocean.,1278374400,23,279,4.326923076923077
8385595,3,B0030BS1FM,It was OK but I guess I expected something more than what it had to give. It was just OK by me.,1488499200,,95,3.3636363636363638
8385596,5,B0030BS1FM,"Amazing idea to use CGI to show us the bottom of the oceans. Forgive my ignorance, I thought the bottom of oceans was made of sand, not mountains and caverns.",1483488000,,158,4.3
8385597,5,B0030BS1FM,Great service. Very interesting video.,1483401600,,38,6.8
8385598,4,B0030BS1FM,"This is a graphic National Geographic presentation that is very well done using computer generated sequences to tell the tale of what lies beneath the ocean.  More of an overview and shorter than I would have liked, this story is filled with interesting information that would be difficult to find elsewhere; however, the editors picked certain areas of the ocean and left the majority of Earth's watery domain still ""incognito"".  The film actually arrived less than a week after I watched this on the National Geographic Channel, so a second run-through gave us an interesting but redundant evening- it was the same film altogether.  Perhaps it will be more valuable in a couple of years when the information is not so fresh in my mind, and I will enjoy it yet again.",1478304000,,768,4.803030303030303

8385602,4,B0030BS1FM,I saw this a long time ago on tv.  And I was blown away. So when I saw it was on a disc I said oh I have to have it.  This is a really nice piece of work.,1460592000,,154,2.923076923076923
8385603,5,B0030BS1FM,I find the subjects of early life and the formation of the earth to be interesting subjects.  The title of this dvd grabbed my attention and after reading the description of it I wanted to see it-since it's from National Geographic I figured it would be a quality show that I would want to rewatch and therefore should own.  I was not disappointed.  It is very interesting as the drain away layers of the ocean and show you what appears and how the land looks with out water above it.  The black smokers were interesting and they show the smoke still billowing out and away from them-with out the surrounding water.  Besides showing the land they also take a look at some of the animal life and coral that live in the different layers of the ocean's water.  It was surprising seeing to learn there are similar land features that correspond to land features on the ocean's floor-canyons and prairies/flatland- as well as the portions of ocean landscape that are totally foreign looking.,1452988800,,985,4.664739884393064
