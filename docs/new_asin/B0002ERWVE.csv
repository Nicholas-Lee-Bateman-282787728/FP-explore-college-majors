This show has been an inspiration in my life and of course I will be buying it just not at this moment.  This is a show full of love, peace compassion and the heart felt words of Gods love and Truth it is such a positive show and I am finally glad someone came out with this show and hope they will come out with many other series.  Thank you Christopher from Salinas, CA.",1088726400,10,468,4.1098901098901095
2081824,5,B0002ERWVE,"Though I have recorded every episode (and watched them time and time again), I am excited beyond words at the First Season Release of TBAA on DVD and hope that Paramount will do so for all nine seasons. I have been waiting and hoping for this since the show ended, much to my dismay. Every episode touched my heart in such a way in which no other program could ever compare. While boldly, yet sensitively, portraying practically every issue we are faced with today; the show always leaves you with a sense of hope and encouragement, and the clear message that God is always there if we'll just reach out to Him.",1088726400,5,611,4.464285714285714

2081841,5,B0002ERWVE,"I had pretty much forgotten about this series until one of our t.v. stations ran several of the Christmas shows from it during this past Christmas season.  I really enjoyed them so ordered the first 3 seasons.  I have been enjoying these programs so much.  I really like this show better than Highway to Heaven since I've always found Michael Landon to be a bit ""overdone"" in his portrayal with too much vanity showing through.  The only thing I've noticed about these stories is that on a few episodes they don't ""finish"" the story  sort of leaving you hanging there but maybe that was on purpose.  It's always a good story and uplifting and I think we all need that and always will.  I wish there were more good series on t.v. in this more and more violent t.v. and video game society we seem to have now.  Makes me wonder where they plan to take this violence next.",1485388800,,868,4.415094339622642

2081851,5,B0002ERWVE,"This is a great alternative to the junk on current TV. The Christmas episodes along with those dealing with homelessness and alcoholism were excellent. After watching this, I began to realize how many episodes I'd missed when it aired originally. I like the fact that they included the two-part series finale. You can see how hard they worked to tie it back to the very first episode. I also like that some of the episodes have producer comments. It's nice to see how much thought and work went into these shows, which are uplifting and thought-provoking.",1473897600,,555,4.791666666666667

2081854,5,B0002ERWVE,"Touched by an Angel is one of those shows that you need kleenex in one hand and your remote or popcorn in the other. Every show tells of the angels helping a family in need or a person who for one reason or another needs help whether they are on their way out of this life or where they can make life better the angels are there to help.
Each show is a hour long love fest and each show is better than the one before.
I was thrilled to see that all the seasons were on DVD and I bought them all. I'll most likely watch more than once for each is a treat and a treasure and if you believe in miracles or angels you'll love this show---and if you don't...you'll love it anyway!!",1465430400,6,676,3.9779411764705883

2081895,5,B0002ERWVE,"Touched by An Angel; The Complete First Season On Dvd comes in a set that has four dvd holders. I also like that each dvd cover has a title and description of each episode. Of course, there are also pictures on each of the dvd covers.  For instance, the first dvd which has a red color background and photo  scenes from each episode are The Southbound Bus,  Show Me the Way Home, Tough love, and Fallen Angela.  There are 13 Episodes produced for Season one and a two part series finale (as listed on the back). The special features of the dvd set are: an extended version of executive producer Martha williamsons 60 minute interview with Ed Bradley, Martha Williamson talks about Touched By an Angel, Touched by an Angel Says Farewell, and four audio commentaries on the Southbound Bus, Tough love, Fear not and There, and There But for the Grace of God.

It has caption for those who need it.  For me the show has a significant problem.  That problem is ""Highway to Heaven"".  For me ""Touched by an Angel"" just can not compare to Michael Landon's show. Jonathan Smith (Michael Landon) was a master at bringing out emotion & he was directly connected to the ""Boss"".  No go-in-between, but realize Monica needs a supervisor!  Also the ""death angel"" concept doesn't do anything for me for me either.  We watch ""Highway to Heaven"" a number of times a month & ""Touched by An Angel"" once every several months.  We have two seasons of ""Touched by an Angel"" &  will not be buying any more (probably will not view all of them).  We will be buying all the season's of ""Highway to Heaven"" as they become available.",1403654400,2,917,4.431137724550898

2081920,5,B0002ERWVE,"TOUCHED BY AN ANGEL was a TV series that had a very good production value in my opinion. The series delt with alot of issues that can effect us all as human beings. In each episode they would let the person or people that was their assignment that GOD loves them without being to preachy. It's been said by other reviewers that the series was to preachy I don't think it was. People need to know that GOD loves them no matter what decisions they make because he does love them and he gave them a free will. He may not like all the decisions we make but there is nothing we can do that will ever make him stop loving us. I feel the episodes were very engaging and interesting and while entertaining were also informative and made you want to go out and do something nice to make the world a better place that was the main point I believe of the series. I heard Roma Downey recently say that before they would shoot a scene were they did the reveal of an angel they or she would pray that GOD would be in it and that he would be lifted up. Although the series was created and produced by Christians they didn't just stick to one particular faith. This is a series that I would recommend to the whole family and take it as a learning experience and not just entertainment although it is very entertaining. The series was made in a way to make people think. This was one of the best television series on TV back in the 90s with the exception maybe of ""7th HEAVEN"" which was also a very good show that was informative and engaging as well as a teaching tool. I give this series 5 stars because I feel if any television series deserves that high rating on amazon it's this one thank you!!!!

I had tough issues to deal with, while this show did not solve any of them. It gave me perspective and showed that life is worth living. Life isn't always fair and this show dared to present to us moments of that truth. So, that is why I am recommending it.

I am not suggesting any specific faith, however in my humble opinion, it doesn't hurt to have something to hang on to.",1394582400,,522,4.158415841584159

2081929,5,B0002ERWVE,"Touched by an Angel is the sweet story of an angel named Monica (Roma Downey) who finally gets promoted to caseworker and her journeys throughout the years with another angel named Tess (played by Della Reese). Episodes included are The Southbound Bus, Show me the Way Home, Tough Love, Fallen Angels, Cassies Choice, The Heart of the Matter, An Unexpected Snow, Manny, Fear Not! which was honestly one of my favourites, The Hero, There But For the Grace of God, Angels on the Air, and In the Name of God which was an excellent episode teaching people why it is so wrong to hate people based on their race and ethinicity or religious affiliations. It even includes I Will Walk with You which looks like it was the last and final episode of the series and a very good episode at that featuring an all star cast.  All of these episodes are beautiful and are tear jerkers but if I could recommend an episode to watch, I'd recommend watching In the Name of God. That is a message so many in this world especially here in America need right now. I will never forget the words of Tess from that episode, "" Free will is a gift. Love is a choice. Hate leaves you no choice at all."" There were some later episodes later in the series that I didn't like so much mostly because in the later seasons I felt they brushed upon issues that seemed to doctrinal and lost the message of the first season. The first season will always be the best one and I highly recommend purchasing it for it's messages of hope and love which is something we all need...especially around the holidays. I'd recommend the other seasons as well having remembered watching them on television for so long even the ones that I felt got a little too doctrinal because everyone has a right to watch those and draw their own conclusions about how they feel about them. If you need something to pull you up out of the blues during a holiday season, I recommend this series. It's upbeat. A lot of the time it has a happy ending. It's positive. And Della Reese can sing really good! So I recommend this series for all those angelic hearts out there.",1387152000,4,2104,4.4366925064599485

Unfortunately, the DVD's suffer from poor quality transfer, and they look particularly bad on today's BluRay players that upscale older DVDs.  I purchased seasons 1 and 2 so far, and the reproduction looks more like an old 8mm movie trying to be synced with a 33 rpm vinyl record.  You would think CBS would take the time to remaster and upscale the shows properly, but they did not.  OK if you can get them on sale......",1355356800,,510,4.510869565217392
2081961,5,B0002ERWVE,"I love love, we love love love Touched by an Angel!!!! This is wholesome clean fun and inspiration for the whole family! We received our order and can not stop watching this series. We are going through them so fast, that we are chasing down the rest of the seasons.

This is fun for the whole family.. We found the first season for $10.00 and some change through Amazon second season for $8.49, we thought that it was cheaper to buy the seasons individually instead of the bundle for over $100.00, so far so good.

Touched by an Angel has such great talent, values, morals, and lessons. We are so glad that we are able to view this talent and be entertained with clean T.V. shows.

We want to own the whole season for TBAA because we love it! We want our children to see what real T.V. and good T.V. shows really are and because we love this T.V. series, its clean inspiration, values, and lessons! Great for family laughs! We cut the cord on cable and now view TV though our DVD collection or watch though Netflix on our Roku. We just grew tired of paying for paid TV with nothing good to watch. We are also looking into Sky Angel Fave T.V. Which is affordable and worth the money. Sky Angel has T.V. like Touched By and Angel which will pay for itself though inspiration, clean T.V., morals, values etc.  Sky Angel will leave you filled with encouragement etc.

We could not find this show on Netflix and decided to purchase this set as it was more affordable to purchase the set. Which is okay for us as we like to take our DVD's with us while on the road as it makes for some fun times. This has also come in handy when we are out and have to wait for long periods of time..

So back to the reason we went ahead and purchased this collection. Due to the garbage on T.V. these days, looks like many people are looking for great T.V. shows and are turning to shows like this again. Many people are tired of paying for trash T.V. so they have found other ways to view T.V. the way they want to. Looks like this is the growing attitudes with paid for TV these days.. And I know many like this show so it is in demand!

Anyway, our family loves this show and glad that we were still able to find this show for a decent price.. We don't want to spend too much money out of our budget. We are just glad to be able to watch T.V. the way we want to and not have to pay for crap TV. We are tired of today's T.V. shows.. It's really sad that such a good method of influence has turned into trash T.V with the exception of National Geo etc.. Any way, if you want clean T.V. this is it!

I can say since we cut cable off we have a better free life.. seems like we have more family time and time to do the things that we want to do. Plus we pay for the shows that we want like The Cosby show since it is not on Netflix. I am glad that this T.V. series is available on Amazon.

This T.V. Series teaches a lot of great lessons and also entertains you.. Miss those days of shows like this. So if you are looking for clean great family fun, this show is for you.. You will not be disappointed. Our children love this show!

Happy viewing! And if you are looking for more clean shows, don't for get shows like this.

Shipping was as expected and we are in the process of viewing all the DVD's so we can see how they play!

I also purchased seasons 1-3 of ""Highway To Heaven"".  If you're looking for entertainment that isn't filled full of the murder and other violence and darkness that is shown on other TV shows nowadays, then ""Touched By An Angel"" and ""Highway To Heaven"" are both excellent choices.",1293580800,,536,4.793478260869565

2081976,3,B0002ERWVE,"I really do like ""Touched by An Angel"", but the endings are always the same. The angels arrive in disguise on the scene to help some clueless human see the error of their ways. This usually doesn't work so they turn on the glow and announce ""I am an angel and God loves you"". This of course solves everything and everyone goes away happy. Of course if they had done this at the beginning of the episode, there wouldn't be much of a show!

 I much prefer ""Highway to Heaven"" where Michael Landon as an angel rarely tells the people he's there to help that he is an angel. I can better relate to something like that.

Further, the storyline and script doesn't really overly promote God and religion; instead making the emphasis more on living life right, filled with love, hope and faith.

A great bonus for this product is the inclusion of the TBAA Finale on the last disc. Particularly useful since you can watch all discs from start to finish, and the storyline of the finale does refer back to characters from Season 1.

The show is finding itself and in comparison to the later seasons, it's the weakest. Despite that, viewers can still enjoy this season of Touched by an Angel.  It's still enjoyable entertainment with wonderful characters.",1168992000,4,570,4.568627450980392

Imagine her disappointment to discover the set was not closed-captioned.  It is shameful to ignore the deaf community who should be able to enjoy the inspirational message portrayed in the series with the rest of the family.  It has sadly tainted the wonderful feelings we had for the series.

All the episodes touched my life tremendously and I could hardly wait the next day to look at another on TV.  However, thanks to DVD and Amazon for having these available to us to purchse it..I was so very delighted to have my own now!!!!!!!  Touched by An Angel is what our kids should look at to understand and know about God and his pure love and to teach them it is ok to be humble and be an example of Jesus.  All the GOOD shows are off the TV to replace violence and nudity for our Kids to look at ...You can see how Satan is in control!!!

Thanks for giving us something positive and real, thanks again to all cast and producers of this show!!!  God Bless You All!!!",1143936000,11,746,4.075342465753424
2081990,5,B0002ERWVE,"This first season of ""Touched By An Angel"" is pretty good. I think it's slightly better than Season 2. They don't make shows like this anymore. And so far, there aren't anymore reruns of this show. Therefore, I recommend that all fans of this show should buy this set, along with Seasons 2 and 3. This set also includes the Two-Part Series Finale, ""I Will Walk With You,"" which in my opinion, is a great finale. The only downfall about this set is that the transfer is quite poor on the Season 1 episodes. Now, as far as the picture quality is, it's not all that great. The main problem with the picture is that it is very grainy and there is some jerky images, which is very noticeable in the opening credits. The good thing about the picture is that it's very sharp, but the quality control was obviously poor. As far as the sound quality is, it's quite poor. This Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo sound was very poorly done. It sounds like it wasn't compressed very well. However, all of these quality issues are the exact opposite on the Two-Part Series Finale. On those two episodes, the picture and sound quality is fantastic. The picture is very sharp and was transferred beautifully. The Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo sound on those two episodes is amazing. It has very deep bass, especially on the opening credits.",1141171200,2,1310,4.555084745762712

2081992,3,B0002ERWVE,"This is what good television could be- it's meaningful, has a purpose, and makes you believe in something none of us can see. The perfect family show that should have been on T.V. longer...

Each story leaves you with a certain impact and unknowily makes you feel a little better about the world around you. I remember spending every Sunday watching this show with my family and decided to buy season's one and two-

However Season one is not my favorite- the stories lack what the second season has... but, it's stil just as sweet and endearing as the second season. I love watching the episdodes when things seem to be going wrong for at the end of each of them i have a new kind of faith.

The show in many ways is better than the somewhat similiar Joan of Arcadia- in the fact that it makes you see how people during times of struggle-who have began to question their faith come to believe and be changed for the better due to the impacts of angels that have come into their lives. By the end of each episode I truly believe that God in our times of trouble sends us an angel to help us- 3 1/2 stars for the second season is ten times better.

2081996,5,B0002ERWVE,"Nominated for 3 Golden Globes and 12 Emmys, including two by Della Reese for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, Touched By An Angel built a sizeable and loyal audience with its upbeat themes and inspirational storylines. The brainchild of John Masius, creator of Providence (1999) and writer for such hit series as St. Elsewhere (1982) and LA Law (1986), Touched By An Angel follows in the footsteps of Michael Landon's successful series Highway To Heaven, which chronicled the exploits of a single angel who wandered across the United States providing support for lost souls in need of aid. Touched By An Angel is quite similar, but the series uses multiple angels to achieve its purpose. Like Highway To Heaven the series utilizes a contemporary setting and modern problems, allowing the show reach a broad audience who enjoy its themes of love, hope, and redemption...

Touched By An Angel follows the exploits of several angels sent to Earth as ""caseworkers"" so as to bring God's message of love, peace, and hope to the distressed people of the world. When the series begins, Monica (Roma Downey) is a novice caseworker still in training (having just been promoted from ""search & rescue""). Assisting Monica, and a caseworker in her own right, is Tess (Della Reese) who lends the wisdom of her many years of experience in dealing with the problems afflicting humanity at large. Together, these two angels interact with people on Earth, easing the burden of each soul with which they come into contact. In later seasons, Monica and Tess would be joined by Andrew (John Dye), the Angel of Death who also fills in as a caseworker to help lighten the load, and in the final two seasons (2001-2003), Gloria (Valerie Bertinelli) would join the trio as a regular recurring angel character... Overall, Touched By An Angel filled a desperately unmet need along the TV programming landscape. With much of today's programming fixated on sex, violence, and ""reality,"" the hour-long CBS drama provided deeply probing family-oriented content which always left its viewers with a positive and upbeat feeling...

The Touched By An Angel (Season 1) DVD features a number of touching episodes including the series premiere ""The Southbound Bus"" in which Monica is prepared for her first case since being promoted from angel ""search and rescue"". While on the southbound bus, she befriends a young boy named David who tells her the story of his sister and mother's death in a car accident. But when Monica is hired as David's nanny, she soon learns the truth. David's mother is still alive, and Monica's assignment is to reunite her with her family... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""Cassie's Choice"" in which Monica and Tess help a teenager deal with the birth of her child and the decision of whether or not to give her baby up for adoption, and ""There, But for the Grace of God"" in which Monica is stripped of her angelic powers in order to learn a lesson of her own while on a case working with several homeless individuals...

Below is a list of episodes included on the Touched By An Angel (Season 1) DVD:

Episode 1 (The Southbound Bus)

Episode 2 (Show Me the Way Home)

Eventually this led to me to give my heart to the lord and I will always be grateful to 'Touched by an Angel'for starting my journey.

God works in mysterious ways.

I have now got the series on DVD and still watch it on Hallmark.

The symbolism is rich with meaning and the ending was written with such a message of the revelation of God's love that even the coldest of hearts will be softened and the dryest of eyes will be moist with tears.

2082001,5,B0002ERWVE,"Having finally bought my very own copy of Touched By An Angel, the complete first season on DVD yesterday, I'm happy to report that it's still every bit as wonderful and relevant as it was in the initial broadcast. As a 50+ year-old military retiree, I'm happy to say that I love this show and never missed an episode in the 9 years it was on, though it makes me tear up from time to time. Some of the episodes I've viewed multiple times on tape. Since I usually work night shift, I always had to record the show in order to watch it, but it was well worth the time to do so.

It's too bad that the television producers don't know how to come up with more wonderful family-oriented programs like this one. The show's producers, directors, writers and especially Roma Downey should have won multiple Emmys, but you know how Hollywood works. The lowest common denominator gets all the kudos. A special 'thank you' goes out to the executive producer, Martha Williamson, without whom this show would have been impossible.

Though I've had my first generation Philips DVD player since they were introduced in 1997, I've only bought one other TV series on DVD, which was Smallville, another well-written series that can be viewed together with your family. In 2005, we have a total of 7 DVD-capable units in our household - including 2 computer-mounted, a portable, a PS2 and a DVD recorder - but still a dearth of quality TV shows.

Touched By An Angel is the only other one that is worth buying, and I'm certainly glad that I did.

Consider this DVD set a worthy investment that you will not regret!

PARAMOUNT: Please keep releasing all of the seasons! Thanks!

One final note: I believe that angels are real and can appear in any form at any time. Of course they can't all be blessed with the perfectly-cast winsomeness of Roma Downey.",1106784000,48,1833,4.573170731707317

2082005,5,B0002ERWVE,"It would seem to be the trend for most TV writers to only write half as many episodes for a first season. In this case the first season of Touched By An Angel has 13 episodes. So, I'm thinking that the fact that this DVD collection has the entire first season (as promised) plus two EXTRA episodes (the two-part series finale)... is a gift for the consumer.

As for the mysterious ""Fear Not"" episode (#1.10), you can check an online episode guide to see that this was TBAA's Christmas episode for season one. The episode ""The Feather"" is actually the Christmas episode from season two (episode #2.11). So it was not a mistake that it is not in this DVD set. As a matter of fact... even though it was likely filmed much later, the writers were smart in making it seem as if it was the very next day. Also, there is a VHS version with both episodes shown back-to-back... almost as if they were one complete episode.

I can see how someone could have been mistaken or felt misled. But I hope this sets the record straight.

I never saw the two-part finale before I bought this DVD set... and for me it came at just the right time. I was truly ""touched"" by it, and I'm thankful for that.

2082007,5,B0002ERWVE,"This is the one series in recent memory that I 'faithfully' watched each week so its cancellation was a major blow to me. This type of quality programming is hard to find on TV these days (I guess that's why I watch so little), so I was thrilled to see the release of this series on DVD. I hope that Paramount will see fit to release all 9 seasons; I will be at the store when it opens for the release date of each & every season box set as I am that eagerly awaiting them.

My mom loved this series and found great comfort in it during her 2-year battle with cancer. Not much of a TV watcher, I initially declined her entreaties to watch this show, but am glad I finally relented. We both found much comfort, strength, and hope in the series and I am thankful the series continued for several years following her death, as I truly needed the 'strength' it provided just to make it through most days. Luckily, there were nightly 'reruns' on a local station, so I was able to have 'Touched By An Angel' 6 nights a week (and just when I needed it most).

If you never watched this program, buy the DVD and share it with your family. It is truly TV at its finest! Thanks Paramount!! I eagerly await the release of the remaining 8 seasons; they can't arrive soon enough!",1099094400,12,1266,4.2272727272727275

2082012,5,B0002ERWVE,"Some reviewers appear to believe that this first season DVD is incomplete. However, there were only 13 episodes that first season, because the producers had not yet started airing every week, and didn't always know, from week to week, how many episodes they were going to be able to make. Even when they were filming the famous ""Fear Not"" christmas episode, they didn't know if they'd even get to finish the season, much less come back for a second.

During the nine years of Touched by an Angel, Randy Travis and his ""town"" of co-stars appeared in a total of four episodes, including the ""part two"" that one reviewer thought happened in the first season, even though it was later.

This series is one of my all-time favorites. Other favorite series including Highway to Heaven (hurry up and release it please), Babylon 5, and more.

Touched by an Angel is just one out of many books, tv programs and movies (and more) that have influenced my spirituality. Eventually, I hope to list many of those items in a review section at [...] but I'll also make sure to make comments here on Amazon.com as often as I can.

I learned almost two months before the First Season was come out.  I was so excited.  I've waited along time for this, expecting the full season.

But as anyone will see when they purchase this, there is no complete season.  The Christmas episode with Randy Travis called ""Fear Not"" is a two part series.  The second part is not there.

For nine years we were blessed with the most wonderful, edifying and inspirational family drama ever to grace television. This ranks tops above ""Little House"", ""The Waltons"", etc. Why? Because God had his hand on the program and defied all obstacles and odds to become one of the biggest hits in the history of CBS. FOr years it was the #1 drama on CBS...until some idiot decided to change it from its Sunday night family slot to Saturday nights (a night when no one watches television anymore) and the ratings plummeted....through no fault of the show or its producers. This show could have gone on forever and thanks to DVD it will!! Just release all 9 seasons!!

2082023,5,B0002ERWVE,"This show was unique and cutting edge. It dared to tell and show people how much God loved them each and every episode. It is about time it is available on DVD in complete season formats.

It is a show that you can set down with your family and watch and not worry about content. It is a great way to open dialogue about God. The fact that it didn't attach itself to one paritcular religion is what makes it's appeal wide. It touches on subjects like alzhiemers, racism, alcoholism, drugs, teen issues, depression, AIDS, suicide, internet preditors, and many more topics that when watching with your family it can open a dialogue on these issues too.

This should be a must buy for anyone with family that wants something to watch with the kids. It is a must buy for the individual that wants to be reminded that God does love them even with their human faults.

The guest star line up is like a who's who in Hollywood. Bill Cosby, Randy Travis, Patty Duke, Priscilla Presley, Wynonna Judd, Celine Dion, Mandy Patinkin, Cloris Leachman, and etc. etc.

The regular cast that consists of Della Reese as Tess, Roma Downey as Monica, and John Dye as Andrew work so well together as a team and individually that you forget that they aren't really angels, yet makes you hope that there just might be angels like these.

I just hope that seasons 2-9 will also be offered thru Amazon so people like me can have our show back again, even if we have already seen the shows. They are just as good the second time around.",1090540800,64,1509,4.452898550724638
