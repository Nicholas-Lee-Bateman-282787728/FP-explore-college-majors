Well, it may not have cost very much to make it, but it certainly wasn't like one of those B clunkers. I just felt it could have had a better ending. It's worth the money though.

2633916,5,B000HC2M0W,"ok this movie starts out very strong and just keeps giving, when i got this movie i had no idea what it was about just new there was five girls and some lesbian kissing thats was good enough for me. ya ya i know.

After the first 10mins i was really into the movie and wasn't worried about seeing the girls do anything but servive.

For a low budget movie this is one of the best i've seen the writing was very reality based text, thing most people would say in the given situations,

acting was great for actors I haven't heard that much about almost the lines and emotions were believeable.

good story - witch craft

well directed and edited

all of it was Very well done.

plus its canadian 2 thumbs up for canada.

this dvd is a must buy and well worth it.

enjoy the movie.",1162252800,11,779,4.174496644295302

There is this catholic school where a girl disappears & the priest(Ron Perlman) is feeling guilt for her disappearance.

The head mistress is a real shrew and she is determined to make their stay a living hell,in every sense of the word. The 5 girls all have their own unique ability & powers,you have a faith healer with no faith as well as a blind wiccan,a suicidal pagan,a girl who can walk through these objects & a girl with the power to move things with her mind. The 5 girls soon realize there is a sinister reason for being there,the 3rd floor is locked off & the head mistress has made a deal with the devil to get her sister back.

The story line is good, the acting is very good and sometimes very surprising, cinematography (what i used to call photography) is just perfect  and the special effects are ok too, maybe a bit simple in some of the scenes but it doesn't affect the film's quality or originality  at all.

St Mark's Catholic Boarding school for girls has been close for 13 years following the mysterious disappearance of a student who was studying in one of the class on the 3rd floor. Father Drake (Ron Perlman) tried to save her as he was standing right outside the classroom but with no success. A powerful demon (Legion) makes his way in the classroom than tries to posses her (Very awesome scene by the way!!!). The classroom doors get shut and father drake desperately tries to get in to  save the girl but with no results...after a few minutes, he manage to open the door to realise that the girl is gone.....

13 years later the school is re-opened and 5 new girls with  troubled pasts are admitted. The girls will soon realise that there is something wrong with this place as several mysterious events wil start happening. They will also realise that everyone of them as a special ability that they will need to combine against the powerful  demon called Legion if they wanna  get out of there alive!!!....

I'm usually pretty forgiving but, in this case, I was wrong.

**** SPOILERS BELOW ****

I did like how the imagery of a pentagon was repeated throughout the movie to emphasize the connection of the five girls. Their desks, their beds...even the crucifixes stuck in Father Drake's (Ron Perlman) chest. Plus, as I said, I thought the premise was interesting and had potential.

Unfortunately, I thought the story fell short for many reasons. First, why was Father Drake so submissive to the headmistress? Sure, they alluded to how she pulled him from out of a bar but that wouldn't give her authority to remove him from his job. If it was a Catholic school, that would be the decision of the diocese...or, maybe this wasn't an ""authorized"" Catholic school. In that case, he shouldn't be referred to as ""father"" anymore...and if that WAS the case, the writers could at least spent a minute or two and worked that explanation in to the story somehow.

Or maybe, the headmistress' power over Father Drake was the threat of going public with indiscretions alluded to with school girls. If so, it wasn't clear....just an annoying loose end.

The first scene where Elizabeth is killed, assumed to be by the demon - what the heck was with that??? Read any book on screenplays - the first rule of movies is SHOW. Not tell. Not assume. Not allude to. Plus, Father Drake's reaction to what can only be assumed to be a grizzly death was extremely underwhelming yet a portent of the disappointmens to follow for the next 90 minutes.

And that ending....yeesh. After going through battling a demon all night and seeing her friends die, Mara just walks out of the school when the caretaker comes in in the morning, making some glib statement and walks away? And how does the headmistress come back to life after what happened to her? And how does Mara react so nonchalantly to THAT?!?!

****END OF SPOILERS****

Normally, what could save a poorly plotted story full of holes is over-the-top gore. Lots and lots of fake blood and body parts. Nope. Not here. The writers/director/producers thought they were making the ""Sense and Sensibility"" of teen horror and subsequently believed that gore and violence was beneath them. They were spectacularly wrong on both accounts.

So, based on the movie, I would have given the DVD three stars. To add salt in the wound, the producers added zip, zero, zilch, nada, nothing to this DVD as extras (save for some trailers for a couple other movies that I now intend to avoid). No commentary, no deleted scenes, no behind the scenes...nothing.

This one is going to be traded in at the local used movie store. No redeeming value.",1261267200,2,2828,4.774590163934426

2634023,3,B000HC2M0W,"5ive Girls (Warren P. Sonoda, 2006)

Sonoda (Ham & Cheese) turns in a movie here whose tagline was ""how many Catholic schoolgirls does it take to battle a legion of evil?"". How can you possibly go wrong with Catholic schoolgirls battling the devil? Needless to say, the girls are all gorgeous, and when you add Ron Perlman to the mix I'd be fine with this cast acting out the Encyclopedia Brittanica. Well, the end result ain't all that hot, but come on, how can you not love this? It's kind of like Attack Girls Swim Team vs. the Undead meets Fallen, but with Ron Perlman and a bunch of hot chicks. Oh, yeah.

Plot: five girls are sent to a newly-reopened Catholic girls' school. There's Alex (Lucky Number Slevin's Jennifer Miller), whose father believes that here telekinesis means she's possessed by the devil; Mara (The Mad's Jordan Madley), a thief and all-around bad girl; blind Cecilia (Terra Vnesa, recently of Degrassi: The Next Generation), a Tarot card reader; Leah (Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen's Barbara Mamabolo), whose presence here is explained in such a way that I'll let you see for yourself; and Connie (An All American Fairytale's Tasha May Currie), whose parents are trying to turn her away from her embracing of Wicca. On the administrative side of things, we have Father Drake (Perlman), the school's sole teacher, who feels responsible for the disappearance of a student years ago; Miss Pearce (Diary of the Dead's Amy Lalonde), the brutal headmistress who was once a student; and creepy caretaker Vincent (Swamp Devil's James Kidnie), who pops up every once in a while for atmosphere. It doesn't take too long for the girls to realize that they all have some unique and complementary supernatural ability, and also that there's something happening at the school that's very much un-Catholic. The question is, who's on their side and who isn't?

Okay, so hot girls who spend at least a decent amount of time naked, the obligatory lesbian undertones (you knew there was a reason I compared this to Attack Girls Swim Team, didn't you?), Ron Perlman as a priest, and the supernatural. All well and good. Better, the acting was actually better than I expected, especially from Vnesa, who brings a fine balance of cockiness and vulnerability to Cecilia. Meanwhile, the plot really is as silly as it sounds, the script condenses more stereotypes than you can shake a stick at into its wonderful premise, and with one exception (that scene with Leah I referred to earlier), the special effects are pretty darned cheesy. In other words, this is not a horror movie that's going to make you jump, but it does have its uses. Looking for a way to kill a Saturday night? This should be on your list of possibilities. ** ",1248739200,6,2740,4.81104033970276
2634024,3,B000HC2M0W,"St. Mark's School for girls is an interesting place. It's a wonderful setting for reforming unruly girls.

Unfortunately, these bad girls have no idea that a student (inmate?) vanished from the school some years earlier under bizarre, unexplained circumstances. Now, a priest (Ron Perlman!) and a sadistically inclined headmistress (A. Lalonde) are in charge. Of course, the school is under full satanic attack, which could cause educational delays and / or further disciplinary problems. Thankfully, the 5IVE GIRLS are equipped w/ psychic abilities enabling them to fight the nefarious presence. Uh-oh!

2634026,4,B000HC2M0W,"Come on, people.  Satanic rituals, demonic possession, telekinesis, witchcraft, cute Catholic schoolgirls - that's a solid foundation for a horror movie right there.  Admittedly, the plot isn't a perfectly healthy specimen, but I enjoyed 5ive Girls.  A lot of people seem to view this film as a The Craft wannabe, but I don't see any substantive connection between the two films - apart from the occult overtones and the fact that both stories revolve around a cast of teenaged girls.  Like most horror films, 5ive Girls does borrow here and there from films that have come before, but I think it succeeds in establishing its own identity.

St. Mark's School for Girls used to be a well-respected private school - until one of its students disappeared under extremely unusual circumstances.  We know what happened because it makes up the opening scene of the movie.  Elizabeth (Krysta Carter), an especially faithful young woman, was attacked by no less a demon than Legion himself - and Father Drake (Ron ""the Beast"" Perlman), who may have liked Elizabeth a little too much, was powerless to help her.  The school soon closed in the wake of the tragedy - but now, five years later, it has reopened.  Sort of, anyway.  Under the harsh discipline of Headmistress Miss Pearce (Amy Lalonde), who even seems to have Father Drake by the cojones, it now serves as a sort of reform school for wayward girls.  Apparently, the best way to control an unruly teenager is through intense Latin instruction.  Who knew?

The entire student body consists of a mere five girls, all of them dropped off by parents eager to get rid of them.  Apart from the fact that they really aren't bad girls at all, the five have something else in common - each one has a paranormal gift.  Alex (Jennifer Mille) can move things when she's emotional (plus she has the ability to be extremely hot at all times), Leah (Barbara Mamabolo) can walk through certain objects (although we never see her do it), Mara (Jordan Madley) can heal people, Cecilia (Terra Vnesa) can see things in her mind despite the fact that she's blind, and Connie (Tasha May) - actually, I don't know what Connie's gift is (she can whine with the best of them, but that's probably not it).  Anyway, it doesn't take long for the girls to figure out that there is something very wrong with the place.  For one thing, Alex keeps hearing disembodied voices and seeing what can only be the ghost of a former student wandering around.  With a headmistress like Miss Pearce and weird shenanigans going on all over the place, it doesn't take long for the girls to bond with each other - and that's a good thing because before you can say a dozen Hail Marys, they find themselves battling Legion.  Boy, it's a good thing they've got a giant priest around to protect them - or maybe not.

The plot is sort of patched together with spit and gum in a few places, but it manages to hold up pretty well until the end.  With all of the action taking place within the confines of a large and somewhat creepy school building, the film maintains a decently disquieting atmosphere, but none of the slightly cheesy special effects are going to knock you for a loop.  It's a little difficult to accept Ron Perlman in the role of a priest, but the acting is pretty good up and down the line.  The story even manages to keep a couple of plot points pretty close to the vest until the closing moments.  5ive Girls will probably appeal more to the younger segment of horror fans, but I quite enjoyed watching it.

2634041,4,B000HC2M0W,"I bought 5ive Girls because I am a horror fanatic and I've been striking out recently looking for low budget movies for a change instead of the big budget ones like some of this years that have really missed their mark.

5ive Girls does what it says on the tin, introduces you to 5 lovely ladies each with a uniquie gift trapped in a Catholic school for unruly girls.
Governed by a sadistic headmistress, watched over by our very own lovable Reverend Ron Perlman and of chased by a rather nasty Demon.

The storyline is excellent for a low budget and each member of the cast is adorable in their own way giving sterling performances as they are chased through the dark corridoors, turning on each other one by one in a bid to survive the unknown entity hellbent on taking them all to straight to purgatory!

I enjoyed this movie. it's not too intense but gripping enough for you to stay with it to it's not so predictable conclusion.

Give it a go. :)",1197331200,13,951,4.417142857142857
2634042,4,B000HC2M0W,"Years ago, Ron Perlman (who is a priest in this movie) was a teacher at a Catholic school.  One very good Catholic girl was doing her schoolwork in a classroom, when suddenly and completely without explanation she was carried away by supernatural forces.  Flash forward to the present.  The school has been re-opened, and is being run by a wicked (yet really hot) headmistress.  Ron Perlman is back as the priest, and five new girls are dumped in this place by their uncaring parents.  All the girls have supernatural powers, they're also delinquents, and their parents are glad to be rid of them.  As the story progresses, we start seeing the ghost of the girl who disappeared earlier, and of course the girls are determined to get to the bottom of the mystery.  A very satisfying amount of supernatural mayhem ensues.

The good:  Acting is excellent, the script is witty, and the mystery is solved in a very satisfying manner.  It's a bit easy to figure out (even I figured it out before the secret was revealed), but the story isn't very predictable.  There's lots of action, and even the special effects are quite good.  Overall it's a great effort.  Though the trailer for this movie makes it look steamy and sleazy, that's actually a fairly small part of what goes on.  The movie is almost completely concerned with the story.  Though you do get some girls in their undies, a spanking scene, and a topless scene.  And lets not forget some lesbian kissing.

The bad:  The soundtrack.  This is supposedly in 5.1, but it sounds like mono sent to the center and two front speakers.  If you sit anywhere but precisely in front of your TV, it has the effect of making the whole soundtrack seem as if it's coming from either your right or left speaker.  I listened to the whole movie through my right front speaker.  That's just really bad.  Also, the movie really seems to drag towards the last part of the middle portion.  The finale is quite exciting, but about 3/4rs of the way through it seems that the mystery has been sufficiently explored and it's time to get on with the conclusion.  But the middle part just goes on and on.  I had to check the DVD case to make sure this movie wasn't 120 minutes long, but no, it's just 90 something.

Overall, I'd recommend this to horror fans.  It's certainly not a cheesy B-movie, but a polished and professional effort, only tarnished by the crappy soundtrack.",1195516800,17,2406,4.610849056603773
2634043,2,B000HC2M0W,"Basic plot outline: Five girls, each unwanted by the rest of society and each possessing a different supernatural ability, are sent away to reform at a Catholic School. They quickly realise something is wrong when it becomes clear they are the only students there and a ghost is seen roaming the halls.

This film suffers from a badly explained plot and a cliche script. I found myself liking the characters, despite the fact that the acting at the start of the movie was pretty stiff. It does manage to be entertaining -but even those who are big fans of the supernatural will be happy enough to rent it rather than buy it.",1191456000,3,624,4.571428571428571

The music is not the best but I have heard a lot worse. The set is moody and very intense just the thing for the story. Old Ron plays a good priest always does. One quick flash of a breast other than that no nudity though with a good old horror it is expected. Witchcraft, devils, demons and catholics oh and ghost forgot the ghost plus a few other supernatural surprises from our heroines, who could ask for more from a first class horror movie. Not really sure what the others found so wrong with it. There is no sex and very little violence in the movie. Other than supernatural violence.",1523750400,,753,4.347517730496454

8138354,5,B000HC2M0W,"Wow!!!!  A surprisingly good movie from beginning to end.  I normally do not care for this kind of movie for 3 reasons:  First: I do not like how they depict the Catholic church and Catholic all girls schools. Second: I do not like how they depict the girls who attend them.  They usually depicts catholic schools girls as sex crazed, raunchy whores.  Third:  I do not like how they usually have a lot of sex in these movies (in this case it would normally be girl on girl in their uniforms, or even worse, with the Priest).  This movie thankfully had none of that.  It told a very good story and the girls were very likable, well at least after a short while, when their bad girl personas wore off and they showed themselves for who they really are.  The only thing they should have worked on a bit better was not making it so blatantly obvious that she is the villain, they do redeem themselves with her little twist of a backstory.  I do think the end of the movie is very sad, but I guess it had to be to make it a great movie.  I would by all means watch this movie over and over again, which says a lot since I get bored quick.

As for Amazon.  this is the 2nd movie I have seen on your web page in several months.  I stopped watching movies here because they were the worst of the worst out there.  I could not find anything for the longest time that did not look like a high schoolers failing film project.  Both the movies I watched tonight and last night were fantastic.  I see a lot more movies on there I have not seen before and they look like they have promise.  I hope you have stepped up your standards about what you choose to put on amazon Prime.  If I start seeing the garbage and nothing but the garbage I saw before I will permanently end my subscription.",1489276800,3,1776,4.185840707964601
