Some of what happened is so similar to what is currently happening it is uncanny. Not sure when this video will be available, but if those who read this get a chance, you will not be disapointed.",1226534400,,301,4.392857142857143
8199620,4,B000R9AKPE,"If you want to remember what information was availible on the day the market dropped this is a great DVD.  It is a collection of the ABC news broadcasts from that day.  It picks up with the market close and goes through the nightly news that night.  You can look at a chart to see how big the drop was and what happend over the next few weeks, but this lets you hear what was on the news that day and what people were saying on that day.  Anyone can predict a drop a year or two later when we have time to put it all together, this only gives you the information that was avalible that night.  It is a great reminder of what we knew at the time.",1189382400,3,645,3.9307692307692306
