8333992,4,B001GCVK0K,"Based on the background information and the signage surrounding the stage, this Titus set was part of a mutli-act festival and is, therefore, a shorter set than they normally perform. The set list, however, is outstanding, highlighting the best of the band's first singles and full-length release. Patrick (Sickles) is captured in all his ragged glory; this clearly demonstrates why he is one of the more compelling front men out there today. The band are tight, the audio strong and [even] the editing is not as annoying as most current concert releases are (quick cuts/jump cuts).

This is one of the first 'print on demand' releases I've acquuired through Amazon and it the quality is great (I just wish it was a longer set captured!).",1354492800,,738,4.904
