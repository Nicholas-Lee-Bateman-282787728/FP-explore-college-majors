8237501,5,B0010AN7S6,Great fight card. Has the long awaited fight of the iceman vs the ax murderer. Buy it alone for that fight it's self.,1385683200,,117,4.130434782608695
8237502,5,B0010AN7S6,Well I recommend this DVD because I love the UFC and GSP he is great. The only thing that stinks is the UFC fights on DVD never show you everything the PayPerView Events do with the fighters background and what not. Either way some great fights and of course the main event was excellent!,1362960000,,288,4.351851851851852
8237503,4,B0010AN7S6,"I agree with the other reviews the card has its up and downs but liddell and silva is a fight that makes this dvd, it was said best by joe rogan on air, ""these two dogs have been staring through the cage at each other for a long time"" and when these dogs got out it should go down as one of the best fights in ufc or mma history.",1221523200,,329,3.7142857142857144
8237504,5,B0010AN7S6,"Chuck ""iceman"" Liddell and Wanderlei Silva definetly lived up to hype in this match winning fight of the night. St. Pierre vs Hughes was pretty enjoyable for most people (assuming everyone was cheering for who I think they were!).",1212537600,,230,4.923076923076923
8237505,5,B0010AN7S6,Great main events from four legends of mma.  Great special features.  Don't sleep on this DVD!,1209686400,,94,4.8125
8237506,5,B0010AN7S6,"So you're an MMA fan huh...then u owe it 2 yourself to see your favorite fighter LIVE! I did (GSP) and let me tell you this much...the last two fights make this DVD worth the price of sale. Ina whole on the undercard...Gamburyan was dominant...Clementi shut Guillards' big mouth and Machida proves why he is top contender in the light heavy weight division. NOW down to buisness...Chuck VS. Wanderlei was EVERYTHING it was built up to be and more...they stood and traded shots just about the whole way thru...Chuck even mixed in a few surprises and he proved that he was back...they were both in great shape and Chuck obviously respected Wanderlei enough to step up his conditioning, Wanderlei won me over as a fan!...this one left me with very little voice for the Main Event...Georges St. Pierre vs. Matt Hughes for the interum Welterweight title. Hughes looked different this time, like he knew what his fate was to be on this night. During the intermission for the main event fights there was a very loud cheer from the crowd...it was GSP coming into the ring to wave to the crowd and bless himself ( kneeled down in the Octogon and did the sign of the cross) it was a sign of things to come...Matt Hughes was dominated like very few thought he would ever be...even more so then their last fight. GSP was on a mission, you could tell in his eyes, body lanuage and overall aura he had that night...this was a special fight for him. If you're a big GSP fan...you have to believe this was a coming out party for out fighter...he announced to the world that he was the dominant welterweight in the world...hands down! This is was a clinic of ground and pound and dominant wrestling skills from a fighter who just recently started wrestling...GSP!!!",1209427200,,1748,4.62379421221865
8237507,4,B0010AN7S6,"First and foremost, THIS WAS HYPED UP!! This was supposed to be the UFC that surpassed all others. This was to be above and beyond! And as far as main events and co-main events are concerned, WOW!! Let's start with the 3 round fight. This was a fight that was supposed to happen and supposed to happen, but until now, it never happened! Chuck Liddell gets what he's always wanted in fighting Wanderlei Silva. He's always wanted to fight him, and like typical Chuck, he promises a knock out! But Chuck's lost has last two fights. First he lost his title when he faced Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson. And Rampage owned him! And In less than 2 minutes. After that, Dana White and Joe Silva gave Keith Jardine exactly what he wanted, and that was the chance to fight Chuck Liddell. The fact of the matter was simple in that fight. If anybody thought for a second who was going to win that fight, it may have been Keith Jardine alone. And he won with a split decision, some may have thought it deserved to be unanimous. But Jardine was Chuck's 2nd loss straight, and they still gave him the chance to fight Wanderlei Silva. The question is simple. Will Chuck Liddell finally take his training seriously? And will this be what it takes to pump him up to get him back in the win column? But after one masterpiece, there is still a Middleweight belt to be given away. And due to a Matt Serra injury, it will be an Interim belt. And who better then to fight Matt Hughes than an old rival, Georges St-Pierre! This is #3, and each man has lost to the other. What could be better? We are treated to 10 fights!! But are they all good fights? Like I said, there are 10 fights, and they are listed below.

Mark Bocek vs. Doug Evans: Mark Bocek lost to Frankie Edgar by TKO, and Doug Evans lost to Roger Huerta by TKO, so both of these boys want the win. It goes to a unanimous decision.

Roan Carneiro vs. Tony DeSouza: Wild n' wooly DeSouza has a great ground game, while Carneiro just wants the KO over Tony. Ends in the middle of the 2nd round.

Jordan Radev vs. Dean Lister: Ok, aside from a couple of great takedowns, combined with even better ground n' pound when the takedowns DID happen, THIS WAS SILLY!! Borderline ridiculous. This could've been so much better, and it easily went to a unanimous decision. Somewhat pathetic.

Nate Mohr vs. Manny Gamburyan: Great scrap, and it doesn't last too long, barely over a minute and a half! Not bad at all.

Luiz Cane vs. James Irvin: Ok, the theme for James Irvin in 2007 is simply BAD LUCK!! In UFC 71, he loses and can't continue to injury to Thiago Silva. Now in THIS fight, I'll simply say that Luiz Cane gets disqualified, and rightly so. You wanna see how? Watch the fight. Poor James! At least he got the W for his troubles this time.

Rich Clementi vs. Melvin Guillard: An atmosphere filled with hatred stirs the pot even more for this battle. And after watching the first round finish, I lost complete respect for the winner of this match. Show some class, get your hand raised, and say thank you! Totally uncalled for, grudge match or not.

Lyoto Machida vs. Rameau Thierry Sokoudjou: The mysterious, undefeated Machida welcomes the debut of ""The African Assassin!"" This is a great scrap that ends in round 2.

Soa Palelei vs. Eddie Sanchez: Sanchez is always underrated, and all but once has come out on top. Only 1 fighter really pushes the action, and the fight is stopped before the 3rd round comes to a close. WHOO!! YEAH BABY!!

Chuck Liddell vs. Wanderlei Silva: You wanna watch a great fight? Yeah, watch this one! Watch this one go the distance. Some great moments, might've been even greater if Liddell would've quit watching the clock. But it was still great!

Georges St-Pierre vs. Matt Hughes: WOW!! That's all anybody can say. And it ends before the 2nd round comes to a close.

So, you can believe the hype about the 2 events featured on the front cover. Even if there were a couple of boring moments, that doesn't mean it was all bad. And it was actually pretty good! To find out how good, check out the DVD.",1207180800,4,4066,4.444295302013423
8237508,4,B0010AN7S6,"I bought this dvd for st pierre vs hughs, liddel vs silva, and the sokoudju (sp) fight not that the other ones were bad but gosh dean lister you are a wizard on the ground please learn how to strike or some takedowns.  melvin guillard vs the other guy on the ultimate fighter 4 come on who is making these matches not that I want every single fight to be championship caliber but I would have been very upset if I paid money for ppv and saw these fights also ufc really needs to speed up the release date of the dvd's.
Honestly unless you are a manny gamburyan fan I would buy the best of 2007 dvd the only reason I bought this one was because I wanted to see the african guy and he wilted under the pressure of the octagon.",1207008000,,724,4.062937062937063
8237509,3,B0010AN7S6,"Overall this UFC was an alright event. If I were you id just buy the UFC Best of 2007 dvd set because you get the 2 really good matches from this event, Liddell vs Silva and Hughes vs GSP. As for the pre-lim fights on here, they weren't anything special or worth watching twice, except for Gamburyan vs Mohr. Dean Lister gives another boring 3 round fight, and James Irvin's bad luck follows him into his fight with Luiz Cane. Machida vs Sokoudjou was a good fight but I wasn't satisfied with Sokoudjou performance. As for Liddell vs Silva, wow, thats all I can say. One of my top 5 fights of the year, but hey, what do you expect from 2 of the best strikers in that divison! GSP vs Hughes was the fight of the night, but only one fighter showed up with confidence and heart needed to win...the other got dominated.

Matt Hughes vs. Georges St. Pierre (for interim welterweight title)
