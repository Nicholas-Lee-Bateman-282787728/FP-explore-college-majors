3790656,4,B001TI5PYS,"This is pretty good for low budget horror fare.  Some Actors have brilliant performances and others you wonder why they were cast in the first place.  It's an interesting take on the fish out of water horror idea, with the Country guys coming to the big city and find themselves fighting for their lives.  The Vaughn character really makes the film worth watching.",1273017600,8,364,4.746031746031746
8341473,5,B001TI5PYS,"I watched this movie for the first time, years ago and fell in love with it! I've been looking for it recently and couldn't remember the name of it to save my life. I tried typing everything i could remember about it in Google, in hopes of finding it. I got nothing! Then amazon recommend it to me and the picture looked familiar (forced open eyes) and the name of it made sense. Sure enough it was the movie i have been looking for for months! Thanks amazon! This movie is worth watching. I love it!",1518825600,,500,4.21875
8341474,4,B001TI5PYS,"I liked it. It had it's scary moments, gross parts and even funny parts. The bad guy was a true villain, the kind you love to hate. The acting was better than some I've seen, and Vaughn is just like a guy I know. It made the movie even better. Good job.",1509062400,,253,3.8846153846153846
8341475,2,B001TI5PYS,"This movie is torture porn, pure and simple.  I only kept watching to make sure my favorite character survived.  Otherwise, this is trash.",1508889600,,138,4.956521739130435

8341477,3,B001TI5PYS,It's okay.  There were a few really good acting moments where this film flirted with being good.  I'm not sure why the 5 star ratings  This movie is not a 4 or 5 star movie.  There was cheesy dialogue in some areas and a few actors were much better than the rest which really highlighted the bad actors. I used my best wax and made it through.,1508544000,,343,4.074626865671642
8341478,4,B001TI5PYS,"Ignore the IMDb ratings; this is actually pretty good.  I am ""spoken"" of IMDb, and the current low rating seems to be from when the atmosphere and reviewers were very different.  ""Hollywood Kills"" is formulaic, yes, but it's got a ""Saw""-ish taste that's delicious if you like this kind of flick.  And there's a big difference in that the bad guy has to deal with a couple of ""country boys"" who weren't part of the plan.  I enjoyed the fact that the characters were clearly delineated in that the baddies were bad and the goodies were good, with one goody being quite dis-likeable.  I also liked that the movie never lets the viewer forget it's all about Hollywood, bad sets, drugs, drinking, sex, etc.  If you have Prime it's worth a shot.",1507507200,,739,4.5606060606060606
8341479,3,B001TI5PYS,Pretty good mini budget horror with a saw -esque plot that plays on peoples desires and offers horrific choices. The acting is decent but the production values are what you'd expect from a low budget film. All in all a moderately entertaining film.,1496361600,3,248,4.790697674418604
8341480,4,B001TI5PYS,"Mindless fun and the characters are likable and the ones you shouldn't like are unlikable.

What more can you ask for :)

At least a horror movie with a resolution. Not all good, but no BS silly twist that the director thinks is too clever by half.",1494547200,5,248,4.25531914893617
8341481,5,B001TI5PYS,I love this movie.  And Dominic Keating and Zack Ward were great. I love scary movies.  I would like to see a part 2 to this.,1391558400,2,125,3.769230769230769
8341482,4,B001TI5PYS,"Four people become pawns in a private filming and torture by a psychotic film maker. Country girl Sarah Dell (Angela DiMarco) wants to be in movies as does her roommate Chantelle Sholay (Gillian Shure). When Sarah's brother James (Happy Mahaney) and screwball cousin Vaughn (Mathew Scollon) come visit they decide to go out on the town, only to be lured and drugged by said film maker. Their torture is related to what they want most in life.

This is another ""me too"" kids in a warehouse type film. It keeps you engaged.  Characters, other than Vaughn, are not memorable and developed to be bland. Our torturer (Dominic Keating) was not given convincing dialouge. Nice touch with the oriental twins filming everything.

Available on a 30 Horror Film Collection.
