Super creative and inspiring.  I even wrote down 3 books to read because of this movie.  Bonus!",1473206400,,266,4.28
7768049,2,B01GWAZ6ZA,"It could have been a presentation of all the visual richness of steampunk in various media,eg. clothing, accessories, paintings, drawings, equipment, living environments, transportation--all the wonderous things people have done to it and with it to make it the engaging, entertaining concept it is, in which all types of people can become involved  My brain died from lack of oxygen after the first 15 minutes because all the air had been sucked out of the room by a group of pretentious, vapid people in drab costumes trying present it as some high minded/high blown philosophical/political statement of man's relative position in society...blabbityblahblah.  Steampunk is great in and of itself, it doesn't need to be justified or high-minded to be worthy of admiration.",1472860800,,773,5.327868852459017
7768050,5,B01GWAZ6ZA,"Great overview of the multiple facets of steampunk, and the people who make up the community. Fun, enjoyable, entertaining, and educational.",1471046400,2,140,5.714285714285714
7768051,5,B01GWAZ6ZA,"I have been waiting for this movie ever since I purchased the book.  It is a great overview of Steampunk as a maturing culture and all of its diverse elements.  As a part of this culture, I completely endorse it.",1470873600,4,212,4.275

7768053,5,B01GWAZ6ZA,"It's clear that the Steampunk Neo Victorian Future Past folks are brilliant people who embrace love and acceptance. How can anyone not want to be part of that close-knit community? There was so much to love here. Not the least of which was the two lovely people (Mr and Mrs. ""Great"") getting married with their steam family in attendance (Our Gearless Leader Gene and his Bazaar Bride Sandra were left out of the credits, but we saw you both).  This film/documentary will be watched again and again. Next time, we promise not to cry. .",1470182400,,535,4.631578947368421
7768054,5,B01GWAZ6ZA,"Its easy for documentaries on subcultures to take a laugh at the freaks angle, or for them to rely on manufactured drama. Vintage Tomorrows never resorts to this. While it does offer a critical stance on certain aspects of this culture, Vintage Tomorrows is, at heart, a celebration of a community that embraces creativity, independence, and having the courage to make your world the way you want it. As someone says toward the end of the movie, Theres nothing magic about top hats and brass. Thats not whats important. Make your own dream!",1468108800,,540,4.817204301075269
7768055,5,B01GWAZ6ZA,"If you had a time machine, would you use it to visit the past or the future? If your answer is yes, steampunk will get you there in one trip.

Vintage Tomorrows brilliance transcends merely having a fun, fascinating subject matter. Its an infectious invitation into a subculture, issued by the artists, authors, musicians and makers who love it best. Their distinct voices detail not just the mechanisms of steampunk, but the human value hiding between its gears, both social and individual.

A living history of the future (or perhaps the future of our history), this extraordinary documentary is as smart and whimsical and enthusiastically sentimental as a ride in a steam-powered time machine.

All aboard!",1468108800,3,709,5.094827586206897

8763662,1,B01GWAZ6ZA,"this was the worst movie i have ever rented from Amazon.
i rented it because my teenagers are doing a steampunk theme for their prom.
i thought it would be great for ideas and understanding of the movement.
there is very little concentration on the art of steampunk it is mostly the Politics of where steampunk came from and where it is going.
the language was so foul i had to fast forward and stay guarded as to what was about to be said. their was very little to nothing gained by watching it
the only reason i gave it 1 star was because i had to select something to enter this review.
misleading rating.",1519948800,,607,4.28695652173913

8763664,4,B01GWAZ6ZA,The movie is about Steampunk and was interesting but did not keep my attention all the time.  I would recommend it though to anyone who is interested in learning about Steampunk.,1497657600,,178,4.741935483870968
