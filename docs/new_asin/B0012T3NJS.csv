3098783,5,B0012T3NJS,"This DVD presents a classical hatha yoga class taught by the late Sri Swami Satchidananda, a major figure in popularizing yoga in America back in the 1970s. He was the yogi brought from India by Peter Max to address the crowd at the Woodstock Music Festival in 1969, and later started a large ashram in Virginia. He died in 2002, so the class was recorded some time prior to that. The class is composed of six students of varying ages and abilities. The Swami does not perform the asanas, but moves around the room giving instruction and adjusting the students poses.

The asana section opens with chanting ""Om"" and ""Hari Om"", moves on to eye exercises, and then three rounds of sun salutations. The Swami gives instruction for the first round, the next two are done at an increasing pace. The sun salutations are the only standing poses on the DVD, the rest are done in a seated or prone position. After this, the class moves on to backbends (cobra, locust, bow) and forward bends (single and double leg), then into shoulder stand. (Regarding this asana, the students on the DVD are using the old style thickly-padded exercise mats. If you are using a regular sticky mat rather than one of these, I would proceed with caution, and recommend looking at a book or video by an Iyengar method teacher to see how to use blankets as cushioning for this pose). Next comes fish pose, wind relieving pose, seated twists, lotus (or half lotus) and concludes with yoga mudra. Short relaxation periods are frequently interspersed between the asanas.

The asanas are followed by a guided relaxation section done while laying down, including muscular tensing and releasing exercises, body scan meditation, breath meditation, and then savasana in silence. Next pranayama is taught in a seated position, including long, deep breathing, kapalabhati (short, rapid exhalations) and alternate nostril breathing. The class closes with chanting ""Om Shanti, Shanti"" three times and the sutra about ""moving from unreality to reality"" in Sanskrit and English. Bonus features on the DVD include text explanations of Integral Yoga, the Swami's biography, and how to best use the DVD, but the real treat is eleven minutes of vintage footage of the Swami performing advanced asanas, with nice flute and piano music in the background.

According to the notes on the DVD, this system was called Integral Yoga, because the Swami wanted to try to combine the eight limbs of yoga. This is real yoga, as taught by an Indian guru (complete with a long gray beard and orange robe) and does not eliminate the chanting and meditational aspects as is now done in a lot of  American ""yoga"". If you are looking for an extremely vigorous workout in order to get firm buttocks and washboard abs, you might want to try ""Insanity"" instead. On the other hand, if you are looking for ""Sanity,"" this DVD might be more helpful.",1374969600,60,2878,4.855397148676171

8247733,5,B0012T3NJS,"I attended the 13th St. studio in NYC for years and bought the cassette tape of this basic class and followed the audio.

Plus, I believe it carries with it the good will of that wonderful studio, and its consistency over many years.",1495238400,,387,4.791044776119403
