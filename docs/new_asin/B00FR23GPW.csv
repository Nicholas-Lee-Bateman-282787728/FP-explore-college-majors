6021701,5,B00FR23GPW,"I was actually surprised at this show...... But it is really good. Emily is awesome. Just when you think you know her , she pulls another trick from under her sleeve. I absolutely love her ride or die Noland.. smart and witty. Call me crazy but I also really like Victoria and Conrad..... they are actually really smart considering they are the enemies in this show..... I like Daniel but he is you typical jock (not to smart) but extremely handsome.

All in all its a great show and I recommend you watch all seasons... Makes for good scripted television !",1382659200,28,557,4.514851485148514

6021821,5,B00FR23GPW,"There are not enough adjectives to describe the brilliance of this show. From day one, I knew this would be one of the most remarkable TV shows ever written, and I haven't been disappointed. I don't remember a time when I have analyzed a show in such depth as I have Revenge. Emily Van Camp is phenominal in her role as Emily, and despite how I feel about Madeleine Stowe's character, ""Victoria,"" Ms. Stowe has been outstanding. I cannot wait for the Season 4 DVD to come out. I hope that Revenge will be renewed for Season 5, but if not, I do want to thank everyone involved in this show; from the writers to the entire cast of characters - notably Aiden, Nolan and Jack - that I have and will always be grateful for your commitment to this show and your incredible performances.

6021891,3,B00FR23GPW,"For what it is, it's fine, entertaining and suspenseful. Good acting, but believability is stretched to the point of absurdity. New characters come in, others disappear without a trace, and the ones remaining keep fighting each other going around in circles. When is this thing going to end? I heard that a good story--even a series--has a beginning a middle and an end; this is only a beginning and middle. After being all wrapped up in Season 3, I found out there is 4 (easy to guess), but another one? Please, get Amanda Clarke to have her revenge before she turns into a real monster, and get poor Jack out of jail and marry her. And provide Daniel with an exodus--possibly a good kick in the groin.

6021903,5,B00FR23GPW,"One of the better series on T.V. these days.  At least it doesn't subject the viewer to humping and bumping, the ""F"" word or T&A every other scene as some of the other shows are prone to do.  Wonder whatever happened to the censors that used to have input as to just how far a T.V. show could go.  Guess they fell to the wayside as has the majority of America's morals.  The story line is mostly believeable and the actors portraying the Emily and Victoria characters do a nice job although Madeline Stowe can be a bit hammy at times.  Glad the writers got rid of the fake Amanda character.  She just didn't seem to fit or maybe it was just the actor that played that part.",1413936000,,673,4.21875

6021911,1,B00FR23GPW,"Oh, my, my, my...The first two seasons very good, not great, but entertaining and and 'edge of your seat' episodes.  But season three.  Forget it!!  So convoluted and unbearably unbelievable.  Gives daytime soaps a good name.  Time to end already.  Halfway thru the third season and ready to call it quits.  Always a double-cross, a new discovery of a parent, double crosses, stupid incidents that couldn't possibly happen even in TV life!!!  The actors all whisper their lines.  It seems there even laughing at the dialogue they have to say.  Just how can someone, the Miko, character, come out of nowhere and be hired as a nurse where Emily is, then not work anymore.  Huh???  The story lines are  stupid beyond belief. What really ticked me off and made everyone laugh is the episode where a woman tells Jack, I'M YOUR MOTHER!!  But of course.  Must always have a new, stupid plot line. That did it for me.  Come on.  I don't blame the actors for any of this as they need the paycheck, but I DO blame the writers and producers who OK this mess. Reminds me of the classic Carol Burnett series when she skews daytime soaps, AS THE STOMACH TURNS!!  Now THOSE skits were funny, but REVENGE is even funnier...and much more stupid.",1412985600,4,1228,4.606481481481482

There must have been a change in the writers because the fall off was just too pronounced. We ceased caring for all but Jack as characters. All that being said, the season finale was  well executed and filled with surprises . The body count , including for primary characters, was HUGE this season. Maybe actors wanting out which is the custom in British TV?  If Season 4 starts out on the same footing, we will be finished with Revenge which is unfortunate because we binge watched seasons 1 and  2 and were at the time hooked!",1412035200,,675,4.553719008264463

Just like Scandal's third season, Revenge's third season lost it's fizzle and became completely ridiculous. I tuned back in around episode twelve and still it was just dragging on and ridiculous. Get to it, get to it already!!! I know ABC is trying to milk it but at least give us a really good squeeze. I scanned thru the rest of this season when it was finally released on Netflix. And that's exactly what I'll be doing from this point on. I won't be rushing home to watch it on t.v. or wasting money buying the box set like I used to. I won't even suffer thru Hulu or record it on my dvr.....unless they give me a reason to get excited about this show again. The main character is already annoying with her emotionless face and terribly corny fight scenes. So if the story lines aren't great like they used to me it's not worth watching at all.

Emily Van Camp is out for revenge for her father who was unjustly set up by the Graysons and she will do anything for revenge.  However, sometimes her plans have an unexpected backlash.

To begin with  the trailer had me on the edge of my seat. I mean ""Who tried to kill Emily?"", yes, I freakin wanna know..like NOW.
And the no more initiative stuff was definitely a breath of fresh air.

Ep by ep description:
1. Victoria's estranged-and smoking hot-son has arrived in the hampdens. To catch people up,in 2x08 we discovered that Victoria was raped by one of her mother's male friends. This is that baby. Emily has broken Nolan out of jail...see 2x22 for details. Charlotte has returned from a retreat in order to help her with her grief over Dec's death. Emily confronts Jack for the first time since revealing her true identity to him.
2. Emily targets a former Grayson Global executive who is now a clergyman.
3. Aiden's back and apparently siding with the Graysons...or is he???(maybe its all part of Emily's master plan. Who knows?)
4. Emily must rely on help from an unlikely source.
5. Emily may be losing control of her plan and her groom. To his ex, who he hit with a car. Sara.

Sorry. Tangent time. I really like Sara. She's this awesome girl next door...and refuses to screw up Em's happiness with Danny. But I hated that the second that he tells her Ems is not pregnant...she turns into the Lydia type mistress.

6. As Daniel's attention is directed elsewhere, roadblocks mount for Emily; two people start turning on Emily.
7. Conrad hires a PR mastermind (Ana Ortiz) to restore the family name; Emily delves deeper into her plan; Nolan seeks his own revenge.
8. Victoria is eager to throw Emily an unforgettable bridal shower; Emily takes drastic measures as Daniel grows more distant. She tells him she's pregnant.
9. As the wedding of the century quickly approaches, Emily puts the finishing touches on her final takedown. But the tighter Emily holds the Graysons in her grasp, the more they slip through her fingers. Lydia is back...apparently nobody can stay dead in the Hampdens.
10. As the wedding finally arrives, Emily's plan seems poised to go off without a hitch - until enemies unite, leading to dire consequences. We find out who shot Emily.

Part 2 commences.
11. The Graysons try to protect their own, as suspicion grows about the shooting of Emily Thorne. Now Emily Grayson, who now suffers from amnesia.
12. Emily Thorne is remembering again but will people from her and Aidan's past come back to bite them?  Or will she screw her own plan over for that matter...when she inadvertently tells Charlotte her father is David Clarke.
13. Emily's instability puts everything she has worked for at risk.

3 month break and thankfully no more amnesia storyline...that got old really fast.
Sara left in part 1...no we introduce you to Margaux. Jack's new love interest. Even though, she should've really been Daniel's. What? I'm a Jack/Emily fan.

14. Emily's mysterious blackouts put everything and everyone she loves at risk; Victoria is confronted by two ghosts from the past.
15. As Emily's blackouts grow increasingly violent, her only hope lies with the person she betrayed most, while Victoria makes a drastic move to deal with someone from her past.
16. As the notorious Pascal LeMarchal's unexpected visit reverberates throughout the Hamptons, Emily and Victoria go head to head in a very public showdown. . Episode title: Disgrace. The twist: Emily publicly disconnects herself form the Grayson family.
18. Emily uses her newly single status to unravel a mystery from the past as Pascal attempts to make up for lost time with Victoria.
19. Emily and Aiden visit his mom to find any clues to link Pascal to his father's death. Meanwhile Victoria pays a trip to Mason in jail to get his alliance against Emily.
20. As Emily learns the identity of a key conspirator against her father, Victoria sets a trap she knows Emily can't resist.
21. As the Graysons gain the upper hand, Emily must take on a new identity to expose them. This time an FBI agent. She fakes out-or at least attempts to-Pascal.
22. Emily must take serious measures against the Graysons and those closest to her. She kidnaps Charlotte and upon her release(by Jack this time) is used to trick Conrad into admitting his guilt in the flight her(Emily's) father was framed for.
23. Nothing is off limits as Emily and Victoria are dead set on destroying each other. Lives will be lost and fates will be altered, but who will rise victorious?

After the juicy stuff in the finale can't wait for s4.
I'm sorry,spoilers ahead.
Conrad stabbed,Victoria institutionalized, David Clarke is still alive,Aiden is brutally murdered...too juicy.
s4 please. :)",1406937600,4,4625,4.812342569269521

She is seeking revenge on entirely to many people. She could/should have gotten her revenge on the 6 major bad guys/girls in 2 maybe 3 seasons and let it go at that.

6021982,5,B00FR23GPW,"Step aside The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones- Revenge is still alive and kicking.

This one-of-a-kind soap opera continues to deliver in it's third season with bold performances, gorgeous fashion, cinematic settings, shocking twists, biting dialogue and a tersely dramatic story arc. New show-runner Sunil Nayar breathes new life into the show with a brilliantly clever yet poetic realization of Emily Thorne's long anticipated plan to annihilate the Grayson family- in the form of an elaborate wedding. And while complications do arise along the way and things don't necessarily go as planned for Emily and her allies, the season ultimately builds to a final punch that does not disappoint.

6021985,5,B00FR23GPW,"Revenge is one of those shows that is always entertaining. Each season has been full of drama, mysteries, good performance, and of course, a lot of revenge, and season three is not the exception, in fact the show is better than ever!
After a not-so-perfect second season, I had huge guesses about the third season but now that season 3 ended last night I'm glad it did! If anyone has guesses about it, you better catch up before season 4 begins!
The story has AWESOME twists and turns, great performances, and the characters really suffer this season, no one's safe, not even Emily! I loved this feeling of not knowing what's going to happen next, it happens when a show is so well written, and if you believe you were right about something there's always a catch! Revenge is one of those shows.
I'm writing this after watching season three's finale which in my opinion is the best season finale so far!
Emily VanCamp is a terrific actress and she proves it one more time, and the whole cast, including new characters, everybody balances so well, there's never a boring episode or a storyline.
I can't wait to own this season on DVD and re-watch it over again! Revenge fans will be pleased and new watchers won't regret.",1399766400,14,1220,4.60091743119266

In the 80s there were shows like ""Dallas"", ""Knots Landing"", ""Faloncrest"" etc. These shows had a cast of characters who over acted and constantly did evil stuff to each other.  This show is like a call back to those shows but is even more over the top than even those shows.  Everyone talks to each other like they want to kill and eat them ""spoiler"" (save the two characters who died).  There was a dude in season one who sounded normal but now he sounds angry all the time so I think he will live.

Though it is an interesting twist I think there is way too much of it this season. To the point where the show is becoming depressing. Our heroine is being attacked and plotted against from all corners which is hard to watch. Jack, Aiden, Nolan, Danielle and even Charlotte all have it in for Emily at some point in the season.  I think we all want to see Emily succeed at her goal at least on some level, so watching episode after episode of her allies hating her or trying to bring her down can be a real downer.  I do still watch the show whenever I feel like getting into a negative mood, but make no mistake- season 1 is still unfortunately the best season out of the three.",1389657600,9,850,4.3734177215189876
