8483777,4,B005QUFST2,"plot: DICK POWELL is Tom Brant as a Narcotics Agent who witness the death of 100 PLUS people and begins the search for both murders and the drugs they hide.

Tom Brandt chases down a ship just out of the 12 MILE limit of San Francisco in 1930 and the HUMAN cargo is ""tossed over board"" to hide the crime. Soon he is off to Shanghai where he looks for the ""killer"" captain. Since drugs pass all continents he gets full ""cooperation"" of the Chinese Government. With the ""manufacturing"" part of the drugs discovered beneath a rickshaw garage the next step is to Egypt. Powell is distracted by lovely blonde Signe Hasso and her WARD Shu Pan. The drugs are now in the stomach of 10 camels cross into Lebanon. The next phase of the journey is to CUBA where all roads lead to a ship and the final journey into New York Harbor. This is an adventure and a mystery. it moves along very well. BASED on real files and is interesting since the veil of World War 2 are on the horizon and reflect the anti Japanese view of the time. Signe Hasso with never a hair out of place LOL shines as the lovely blonde with lots of secrets. Directed by Robert Stevenson. I give it 4 out of 5. and a GREAT theme song too boot.",1374192000,4,1199,4.21304347826087
8483778,5,B005QUFST2,"saw this movie shortly after it came out to our small town theater about 1950 - it certainly helped to introduce the world to drug addiction, its power and what was in the world's future - way ahead of its time - appear the world did not heed the warning - so sad - Dick Powell has always been one of my favorite actors - i found it to be a very good mystery even up to the end - movie has been hard to find but after all these years ran it down at Amazon and for that i thank you - seen it twice since i got it - thanks - paul",1367539200,,527,3.6315789473684212

8483780,4,B005QUFST2,"A Classic Film Noir. Dick Powells transition to dark and gritty roles, for me, is worth the watching. I'm an admitted movie buff, I've watched and enjoyed a variety of movie genres. Film Noir is my favorite. This particular movie highlights drug trafficing on a global scale in an era when governments began to notice of the cause and effects of drug abuse. The chain of events in this photo play follows the involvement of an assortment of characters cloaked in mystery and intrigue. The Hollywood treatment of the drug issue of the period (1940's), though, somewhat, lackluster is, I think, worth the watching.",1360022400,5,612,4.894230769230769
