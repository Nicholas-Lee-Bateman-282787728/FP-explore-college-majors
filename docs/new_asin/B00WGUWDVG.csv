7132180,5,B00WGUWDVG,"Robert Redford stars as a security expert living under a false identity and running a security consulting firm.  He and his assembled team of eccentrics are paid to break into banks, firms, etc, to test their security systems.  One job they are hired for, however, is not what it seems.  Soon they discover they don't really know exactly who they were hired by, what the mission really is, or whether they can safely walk away once the job is done.

Add a healthy dose of wit to the suspense and you get a clever caper film that is very entertaining and worthy of many repeat viewings.",1437696000,6,585,4.490566037735849

7132184,5,B00WGUWDVG,"A great ensemble cast that made Sneakers a must own movie. I enjoy the premise that there are groups of men that break into businesses to show the owners what they need to do to protect their assets.

The movie then takes a left turn when Robert Redford's past slowly revealed itself as anonymity of his group, and their freedom, is jeopardy.",1475798400,,342,4.516129032258065

8713357,5,B00WGUWDVG,"This is one of the best written, acted, scripted and action movies I've seen.  This isn't the movie for blood mongers as there is none.  However, the humor is sophisticated and the acting impeccable.  Only this movie could make Sydney Poitier appear humorous and he relishes his role.  All the other main cast members play their parts to the fullest with no over-acting and yet a seductive and magnetic plot that keeps one riveted to the movie.  My wife and I have watched this movie over 5 times and yet it will not leave our top 5 list.",1532995200,,538,4.448979591836735
