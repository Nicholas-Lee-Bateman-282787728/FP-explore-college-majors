8444131,3,B004VW4VDU,"I don't know or remember when this cartoon series aired on television but the film, ""Ghostbusters,"" was such a hit film in the mid-eighties. This cartoon series is nothing like the film. There is an ape named Tracy. The episodes include titles such as ""Grab Your Bubble Blaster;"" ""Hop Into the Ghost Buggy and Get to the Ghost Command;"" ""It's Ghostbuster Time!;"" ""Dedicated to Ridding The World of Prime Evil and His Wicked Henchman;"" ""Jake Kong;"" ""Eddie Spencer and Tracy The Gorilla are The Ghostbusters.""

The DVD only runs about 90 minutes (86 minutes exactly). The cartoon is silly at times. The cartoon bares no resemblance to the popular film, They don't just go after ghosts but Dracula in Transylvania too and werewolves as well. If you enjoy the cartoon from the eighties, you will enjoy seeing it again for nostalgia's sake.",1512172800,,835,4.880281690140845

8444133,5,B004VW4VDU,"GHOST BUSTERS is a delightful summer '84 blockbuster about a team of unemployed parapsychologists who arm themselves with snazzy proton guns. For a fee they remove spectres and other ghostie things from the buildings they haunt. Includes an exciting rooftop battle finale against the ancient god Gozer and a catchy Ray Parker theme song (remember him?).
