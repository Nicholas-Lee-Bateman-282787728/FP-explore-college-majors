8340598,2,B001T4Y1FQ,"First, the description says this is a 2010 production, credits list a 1989 copyright date, definitely misleading.

Location/set not really believable, cast not ""professional"" in my opinion.
Story line is weak, acting is weaker.
Shallow characters, one back-story badly done and irrelevant to situation.",1402704000,,302,5.863636363636363
