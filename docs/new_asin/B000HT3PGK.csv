2641055,4,B000HT3PGK,"Yes, leave it to Fox to first screw up the Todd-AO version of Oklahoma! on DVD, and now the roadshow version of South Pacific (disc 2). As other reviewers have commented, Fox spliced the additional roadshow segments into the movie with virtually no restoration. So you go from film frames with brilliant technicolor to others with washed out color, and even film that is at times out of sync. The effect? Simply horrible!!! Yet another brilliant move by Fox.....NOT!!!! Just what I expected from a studio that is only interested in making money rather than preserving a musical national treasure. I just shudder to think what they did to Carousel. Stay tuned, I've yet to review it.",1163462400,,682,4.837606837606837
2641056,3,B000HT3PGK,"Those of us who have loved this film for many, many years (through theatrical re-release, VHS tape, laserdisc and the first DVD) will most likely wonder why the much-awaited 171 roadshow version (not seen in decades) was not completely restored visually.  Fotokem Lab in Hollywood restored the 151 minute ""general release"" version (it's in quotes because general release versions of roadshow films usually don't carry overture, intermission, entr'acte, exit music tracks like ""South Pacific"" has done since laserdisc days)and their web site makes mention of the recently discovered 171 full version, leading us to assume that they were restoring the whole film.  That's not the case here, and it's very jarring to see faded splices of cut material re-inserted into the sparkling, restored shorter print.  Why not restore those 14 minutes to complete glory?  Yes, the frame on the new DVD introducing the roadshow print states ""14 minutes"" not 20 minutes, and also says that roadshows had an intermission.  Huh?  On this new disc, the shorter general release version has an intermission, so what were they trying to tell us?  Even worse, the sound synch is off for most of the restored elements, even carrying over into the restored transitions.  Highly annoying.  Many of us have waited a long time to see the full-length version, which, by the way, played for many, many months in its initial engagements.  It's not a case of a long flop being cut right away (think of ""Star!"").  I'm really disappointed with Fox Video for handling a long-awaited release with such lack of integrity.  The full-length print (if it is indeed the 171 minute version) is now available mainly for historical purposes, since it has been given the second-disc placement in this set and isn't the pristine print the film (and its millions of fans) deserves.  One final complaint -has ""Gonna Wash That Man Right Outta My Hair"" ever been seen in a full-length version of the song? It's complete on the soundtrack album but is very choppy in the film, no matter which version you're viewing.",1163116800,44,2065,5.002923976608187
2641057,5,B000HT3PGK,"This brand new edition of SOUTH PACIFIC is a must for all fans of the beloved Rodgers and Hammerstein classic.  Based on characters and segments from James Michener's ""Tales of the South Pacific"", the story takes place on the islands during the tail-end of World War II.  A pretty young nurse from Arkansas, Ensign Nellie Forbush (Mitzi Gaynor), falls in love with a wealthy French plantation owner Emile de Becque (Rossano Brazzi).  Their relationship is tested when she discovers that he fathered two children with a now-dead Polynesian wife, and that he is wanted for the murder of a man in France.  As Nellie confronts her own fears and prejudices, the handsome Lt. Joe Cable (John Kerr) falls helplessly in love with Bali Ha'i island beauty Liat (France Nuyen).  Filling out the comedy in the tale are Bloody Mary (Juanita Hall), the wheeler-dealer with a heart of pure gold; and Luther Billis (Ray Walston), the tattooed leader of the beach-bound troops.

This DVD has been available for a while in the UK and Australia, and now finally gets a US release this November.  The double-disc set includes two versions of the film: the original theatrical cut, and the rarely-seen Roadshow version which runs for 20 minutes longer with material that was subsequently trimmed for the film's general theatrical release.  Audio commentary is provided by Ted Chapin and Gerard Alessandrini (original theatrical cut); and Richard Barrios (Roadshow version).

Extra features will include the fascinating ""60 Minutes"" report by Diane Sawyer with James Michener returning to the islands and reuniting with people that served as the inspirations for characters in the book...including the real Bloody Mary.  Vintage performances from the ""General Foods"" Rodgers & Hammerstein TV tribute (original Broadway leads Mary Martin and Ezio Pinza), two MovieTone news segments and the trailer.",1156809600,111,1876,5.223333333333334

2641213,5,B000HT3PGK,"This and My Fair Lady are my favorite musicals made into movies.  I have seen some reviews that said they did not like the color shadings in several scenes.  I think it adds enormously to the mood of the film and makes it feel more like seeing it on the stage except a lot better.  It is very well cast and all the acting is excellent.  Beautifully filmed, wonderfully directed.  It captures the true spirit of the show and brings it brilliantly to film.  Personally, I do not care for Rossano Brazzi but he fits this role very well.  Mitzi Gaynor is wonderful and the only choice for the role.  I can't imagine that anyone ever thought of casting Mary Martin - well, except Mary Martin that is.  You can see from the film from the stage show that is a part of the features that she is just waaaaaay too old for the role.  And, even if Pinza had not died, he would still have been waaaaaay too old for the role also.  In this movie everything comes together to make a perfect product.  I wouldn't change a thing. Well, they could take the tie down off Brazzi's horse but I guess that's nit picking.",1411430400,,1098,4.276699029126213

I would love to have been a fly on the walls of that production.  I remember when the musical came to the Odeon, Leicester Square, London in 1964.  In those days, we actually dressed up to go to the picture show.  There was an orchestra in the pit playing the overture and the intermission.  Plus I remember the women walking up and down the aisles selling chocolate, ice cream and cigarettes.  My family and I had really good seats and the sound quality was fantastic.

2641398,5,B000HT3PGK,"I am not sure that this review is for the exact version of the classic ""South Pacific"" I just saw- the one with Mitzi Gaynor et al.

This is a really brilliant musical. While it was filmed way before the Civil Rights era- it took on racism point-blank.

I also have to say- as a woman with a female gaze- there were a LOT of half-naked dudes in this! In general, the women were more clothed than the menz- which is really unusual. I did enjoy the beefcake.

There's also some admirable gender-bending in the Thanksgiving stage show! We have the chick dressed as a lad singing about the enticements of ""his honey""; then we have said honey show up- a guy in a coconut-shell bra and a grass skirt. Very Brit pantomime! Lots of hootin' and hollerin'! And I have to say- the women show really gorgeous legs, and the guys very nice chests (and their pants fit well). I am glad to see a musical in which both the women and men appear sexy-looking.

OK, there are also excellent songs, as one would expect. And while I don't ""get"" the reluctance Mitzi's character has to marrying the guy who has 2 non-white kids- I do think it dealt with it reasonably and in the end she welcomed them as her kids. But- she made a point of being from Arkansas, so that might explain it.

In the end- basic decency triumphs over racism, and that's great. I will mention that several of the beefcake dudes in this are black, and I think this was filmed before integrated troops were the norm (though I could be wrong about this).

In short: I am delighted by the gender-bending stuff here! and I am impressed by the anti-racism messages, way before the Civil Rights movement. And the dudes are really cute (and so are the chicks).

And the songs are earworms. :)

R&H musicals tend to not get a lot of respect, even though most of them are dealing with serious social issues, like racism, domestic violence, stalking, etc. If you have dismissed them as frivolous- don't- they have definite things to say.

(That being said- my favorite musical is ""Guys and Dolls', which has no especial message except that people in a relationship need to compromise.)

I have a more modern South Pacific on my Netflix list; I'm looking forward to seeing that.",1376697600,3,2218,4.481389578163772

2641775,5,B000HT3PGK,"I was just a (very) little girl when we went to a ""drive in"" and saw this movie.

I have never forgotten it.

I was so glad to see this out on DVD and bought it immediately, but am just now getting around to reviewing it.  However, I think I will review it from my five year old eyes, because this movie helped shaped me into the person I am today.

In 1958 ('59 when we watched it)I wasn't exposed to many races of people, but I was exposed to racism, in the things grown ups would say at parties, or children would parrot on playgrounds.  I hadn't formed any opinions on it, and, until this movie, I had never be exposed to ""the other side"" of the argument.

As a little girl, I loved Bloody Mary's daughter, and the ""Happy Talk"" scene in the beautiful water slide and pool of what I now know to be Kauai.  My siblings and I would sing that song all the time, since my mother bought us the album.  But the song I remember the most, out of the amazing score?  When the young soldier and nurse sing, ""You have to be taught to hate and fear, it has to be drummed in your dear little ear.""

It made such an impression on me, and I have never, ever, forgotten the power of the songs in this show.  Did the situation between the young soldier and Bloody Mary's daughter change me forever?  Yes.  It did. I have never forgotten those lessons, and my ""opinions"" on race have remained the same ever since.

So for me, this movie was simply a gift. Who knows what I would have grown up to be like, or how many years it might have taken had I not been very aware of what was trying to be ""drummed into my dear little ear"" and resisted it?

There are so many wonderful things about this movie, my sister's favorite is still the ""Honeybun"" show, my mom's was ""wash that man right out of my hair"" and I loved the scenes shot at the old Hanalei plantation where Nellie danced with the Frenchman.

It's lovely.
It's powerful.
It should be in every video collection.

It's a family movie with powerful messages, and yes, your children WILL get it, while enjoying the wonderful songs.",1278115200,7,2068,4.221374045801527
2641776,5,B000HT3PGK,"I bought the South Pacific Collector's Edition DVD for my father (a navy man himself) a year after we saw South Pacific on Broadway.

He loved the show so much(and plays the soundtrack constantly) that I thought he would enjoy the DVD. I think he loves the movie just as much, if not more, than he loved seeing the show live. He has watched the DVD for the past 3 days straight. Now he is fast forwarding through the film to get to the musical numbers! He especially enjoyed the ""dream/trance"" sequence when the colors shift from realistic to an orange/pinkish haze.

One of our favorite scenes is when Billis is dancing around on stage in a grass skirt. Another hilarious scene is when Billis falls out of the plane and is escaping enemy fire while paddling away in a rubber boat (bullets falling just short of him)

What a wonderful cast of characters! This DVD makes a wonderful edition to any South Pacific lovers collection! :) Enjoy!!",1277337600,,940,4.583333333333333
2641777,4,B000HT3PGK,"What's not to love about this lush adaptation of a great musical? This is one of those musicals you'll find yourself singing and dancing along with. The overall theme is romance, and although the weighty topic of racism is touched on, there is plenty of comic relief. People watching this musical for the first time may be surprised at how many songs they are already familiar with, not realizing where those songs had come from.

But as much as I like this musical, it has some odd faults. Multi-colored filtered lighting flashes on and off abruptly, especially during songs, and is distracting. It's obvious purpose is to provide some ""emotional color,"" but it doesn't succeed. Racism is approached from a Polynesian angle, though a bit awkardly. Amusingly, there is one Black American Seabee featured in a song, but Black racism is not addressed (desegregation in the US military wouldn't occur until 1948). The Polynesian racism was handled in two ""romantic"" but awkward subplots. Nellie, a Caucasian nurse, is in love with Emile, a Caucasian Frenchman who lives on the island. Emile's previous wife, a Polynesian, had died and left him with two young children. Nellie adores the kids and has no problem with them, but she resents Emile's Polynesian wife, to the point where she refuses to marry him. Apparently, Nellie would not mind if Emile had been married to a Caucasian? But then, Nellie also had difficulty getting over Emile being French. Nellie's parochial views truly make her ""as corny as Kansas in August,"" so much so that I wonder why Emile is attracted to her at all. He's rich, handsome, literate, refined, and the most powerful Caucasian on the island, so why does he fall so hard and fast for Nellie? The other awkward romantic/racist subplot is between Lt. Cable and Liat. Liat's mother, Bloody Mary, offers Liat to the ""very saxy"" Cable, telling him that they could ""make love and play all day"" without ever having to work for the rest of their lives. Liat - I swear she isn't a day older than fifteen - apparently finds Cable ""very saxy,"" too, and they are instantly smitten with each other. Cable forgets his fiance in Philadelphia, but the problem of Liat's race soon muddies the clear tropical waters. After ""playing"" with Liat for some days, Cable tells Bloody Mary that he ""can't"" marry Liat, though you can tell that he really wants to. What makes all of this even more awkward is that Liat can't speak any English, putting an ironic spin on the great song ""Happy Talk.""

There is the question of how Emile became such a powerful plantation owner on the island. Is he exploiting the natives? Perhaps Michener's book, on which this story is based, answers that question, but the musical wants us to accept Emile as a swell and honorable guy - except for the fact that he ""killed a man."" I have to wonder why Emile would tell people that he ran away from France because he had killed a man. Sounds pretty bad, doesn't it? But then, Emile will explain the details only to his closest friends, and the details tell a completely different story: Emile killed a man in self defense, and even then only accidentally. Such an event is unfortunate, but it is hardly a dark, scandalous secret; in fact, Emile's part in the incident was rather heroic. Again, maybe Michener's book would provide more context. But Emile displays more inexplicable behavior when at first refusing to volunteer for a very dangerous military mission because he is in love with Nellie and he doesn't want to risk dying, but then, when he thinks he has lost Nellie to the racism problem, he then volunteers, apparently unconcerned that his two young children, who have already lost their mother, would now likely lose their father. Emile will live for Nellie but not for his motherless children? Kind of takes some wind out of the sails of romance and heroism, doesn't it?

And yet another odd, if minor, fault is that even though the beguiling island of Bali Ha'i is expressly off-limits to US servicemen - probably because the US Command doesn't want to deal with the problems stemming from American men ""playing and making love"" with the natives - the US servicemen balk at their orders and go anyway. Was there some kind of ""Don't ask, don't tell"" policy going on even back then?

As I said in the beginning, what's not to love about this musical? But even with all of its quirky faults it is still well worth watching.

An interesting bit of trivia: This film was shot in Hawaii, and the little boy playing the role of Emile's son is a very young Obama, which proves that he was indeed born before Hawaii became a state. :-)",1270684800,2,4625,4.711990111248455

On an unnamed island somewhere in French Polynesia, a conclave of sailors, Marines, Seabees, and Army pilots waits its chance to strike at the Japanese holding some of the nearby ones.  Among the nursing staff of the fleet hospital located there is Ens. Nellie Forbush (Mitzi Gaynor), a self-described ""little hick"" from Little Rock, Ark., who has recently met a middle-aged French planter, Emil DeBecque (Rossano Brazzi), and finds herself ""wondering how she'd feel, living on a hillside, looking on an ocean...""  To the base comes Lt. Joe Cable, USMC (John Kerr), whose Colonel wants him to set up a watchpost on one of the enemy-occupied islands--if he can get someone local, like DeBecque, to help him.  Local Tonkinese entrepreneur Bloody Mary (Juanita Hall, recreating her stage role), however, has other plans for him.  Meanwhile, Nellie struggles with the great differences between herself and Emil--his greater age, his superior education, and worst, the fact that he's a widower with two young children by a native wife.  And Cable, meeting Mary's lovely young daughter Liat (France Nuyen), likewise tries to come to terms with his almost immediate love for her and the fact that she isn't white.

Although the color filters used in some of the sequences are distracting, the exteriors are gorgeous (they were clearly shot on an actual island, though which one is never revealed; the distance views of the soaring peaks of Bali Ha'i are particularly breathtaking), and this movie adaptation, unlike some others (like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-King-and-I-50th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B000HT3PGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The King and I (50th Anniversary Edition)</a>, retains all the songs from the original, even though one of them (""I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Out of My Hair"") is truncated.  Gaynor ably steps into the part made famous by Mary Martin, although her singing voice, like Brazzi's, is dubbed.  Ray Walston as the wheeler-dealer Seabee Luther Billis adds a wonderful comic touch.  A splendid musical film that families can enjoy together and that may also inspire discussion about its underlying message.",1267488000,2,2601,5.8936170212765955
2641780,5,B000HT3PGK,"The music in this movie is it's best asset. Viewer be warned: All of these people were dubbed, and you WILL notice it too, so don't let that get in the way of the melodies.
You will not help noticing the leffect of filters in different colors: Redish for sunset, intense Technicolor Blue for romantic scenes, Blinding Yellow for beach scenes, all of these are light versions of the formica and plastic that had started to invade America and it is an aesthetic pop-cultural phenomenon that remains unmatched. I daresay it may have influenced Andy Warhol's color schemes.
I found the whole story particularly difficult to believe, even by Holywood's standards, and had it not been a musical, the movie would not have been a pleasure to watch. Mitzi Gaynor is superb as an early fashion icon for lesbians. Her athletic, strong and horsy version of womanhood has been an inspiration for Gay women everywhere, as well as her early-butch haircut that is so fabulously curled when wet. Her consistent masculine fashions and manish demeanor, even when speaking in French  can only be understood from this perspective.
Juanita Hill is great in her role, but Mitzi truly is the paramount presence in the film. From a sociological perspective, this is an indication of the new roles of women in America after the war.
The lead roles for the men are not as exciting: Rossano Brazzi is just too uptight to be French and John Kerr is not inspirational as the young hero soldier. Although he is shirtless in most of the scenes, he emanates the sensuality of a pine trunk recently cut down. It is hard to believe that the beautiful native girl (that looks more Chinese than islander) could fall in love, and so quickly with this dead beat. The men in the background look better suited for these roles. There are plenty of shirtless handsome guys in the film, which is a definite bonus.
Culturally speaking, it is sort of embarrassing to see the dance-ceremony sequel which had African masks galore and  a confusion of dance/choreography rhythms that could only be summarized as post-king-kong-erotic-island shake. There is also plenty of misplaced Chinese infusions, from the ultra-white shirt that Liat wears to Emile's children's physical looks, accents and overall demeanor.
However, It is easier to understand this film as a product of the times that had also recently produced the atomic bomb.

2641879,5,B000HT3PGK,"It's hard to believe it has been 50 years since I first sat in a theater and was smitten with the beauty of South Pacific.  The unforgettable songs stuck in my head and I replayed and replayed the soundtrack for years.  The energy of Mitzi Gaynor as Nurse Nellie Forbush, the passion of Rossano Brazzi as Emile de Becque, the tender young love of Joe Cable and Liat portrayed by John Kerr and France Nuyen, were all imprinted on my young mind and began in me a love affair with musicals.

I recently ordered the DVD as I plan to visit New York and see the wondrous stage version in revival for the first time at Lincoln Center.  Not surprisingly, I remembered all the words to all the songs and was thrilled once again by ""There Is Nothin' Like A Dame"", ""Bali Ha'i"", ""I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair"", ""Some Enchanted Evening"", ""Honey Bun"", and all the other wonderful songs that comprise this classic musical.  What struck me most was the relevance the themes in this movie still have today---the fear of someone different and the inbred prejudices so accurately pinpointed in ""You've Got To Be Taught"" are still as important to remember as they were in 1958.  The sheer enthusiasm of all the songs, the wit of Ray Walston, and the haunting voice of Juanita Hall all combined to bring this both tragic and comic tale to life again.

The Collector's Edition video contains some remarkable extras that you will not want to pass up after viewing the movie.  Most notable is the 60 Minutes interview with James Michener when Diane Sawyer takes him back to the islands that inspired his first novel, the basis for the musical.  Also, the featurette on the making of the movie is most interesting with footage of the stars on location and information on what it took to transform the island into a movie set.  The vintage clip of Mary Martin and Ezio Pinza recreating a bit of their Broadway roles may either settle once and for all who the best Nellie was or forever keep the argument alive.  Definitely, this DVD has some of the most interesting extras I've seen on a disc.

If you want to relive this magnificent tale of young Americans  far away from home during World War II and aching with loneliness but afraid to love someone ""different,"" you will be captivated by its magic.  And if you have never seen it before, you definitely want to remedy that situation.",1207008000,17,2374,4.555294117647059
2641880,5,B000HT3PGK,"To my thinking, this is the best of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals on screen.  With a lush tropical setting and rather odd dual love stories, plus a theme of racial tolerance and the beauteous Mitzi Gaynor, this dazzles the eye.  But with all that, it would be a dud without the music.

For the most part here, the songs are excellent, especially ""Some Enchanged Evening,"" ""Bali Hai,"" ""You Have to Be Carefully Taught,"" and ""Nothing Like a Dame.""  Once they enter your head, they never come out.  There is one song I think is downright silly, however, and that's ""Happy Talk.""  Why it was included is beyond me.  It isn't even close to the others in melody and certainly not in lyrics.

Mitzi Gaynor is the star of the performers, not Brazzi, Kerr, Nuyen, or Walston.  She lights up the place that is already nice to look upon, and she sells every song she sings.  It's unfortunate that she was not an even greater movie star than she was.  I've seen her stage show, and she was sensational with that as well.

A fine addition to the movie itself are the extras, especially the bit with Mary Martin and Ezio Pinza, stars of the original stage production.  I've always liked Ms. Martin, but she was no match for Gaynor.  And then there is the 60 Minutes segment when the author of the Pulitzer Prize winning book went back to the South Pacific where he had served during World War II.  I often skip the extras.  I'm glad I didn't here.  They add much to the enjoyment of the movie.

This is simply a better movie than ""The King and I"" or ""Carousel.""  It's one to watch again and again--and I will whenever I'm feeling down about life.",1203984000,9,1639,4.439597315436242

2641898,5,B000HT3PGK,"I first saw SP on black and white TV in 1971 and '73 and was spellbound by the story and music.  In 1978 while in New York City I saw an ad in the paper that it was showing at a movie theater in downtown Manhattan so I jumped at the opportunity.  I was so glad I did because the theatrical experience is unforgettable. That soundtrack is done full justice in a big theater. You can see why SP got the Academy Award for ""Achievement in Sound"". Moreover, the big-screen experience, the gorgeous colors all come together beautifully. This happened again in 1986 at another special screening and I was lucky enought to repeat the experience.
Like others, I cannot understand why this film was criticized so harshly.
I found Mitzi Gaynor ideally suited for the part of Nellie. From the ecstatic heights of singing & dancing about being in love with ""A Wonderful Guy"" to depths of despair as she struggled with the demons of ""Carefully Taught"" racial prejudice, she conveyed the full range of emotions  Nellie the Nurse experiences. The other actors were just as good. The movie packs an emotional wallop about bigotry that is bold for the time it was released and it darn near breaks your heart in the process.
It contains all the spectrum of emotions - laughter, tears, anger and of course love.  Rodgers & Hammerstein's musicals certainly had what I would call ""heart"".  They were not ""fluffy"" like the MGM musicals of the 40's.  They had a message and the songs somehow stay with you longer.  I find ""South Pacific"" one of the most haunting, but in a pleasant way.

2641914,5,B000HT3PGK,"Over the decades, I've seen this film many, many times -- on TV, on VHS, on laserdisc.  Each time I saw it, I wanted it to be a bit more than it was:

  -- I've always wished I could appreciate the performance of Ray Walston as Luther Billis, because all of his scenes were pure ham, and he seemed to ruin all the scenes he was in.

  -- I have always wished ""I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outta My Hair"" was as complete in the film as it is on the RCA soundtrack  recording (I'll tackle this now -- experts at the studio maintain that the complete version never made any final cut of the film).

  -- I've always wished I could see the film as originally assembled and premiered.

  -- I have always wished Alfred Newman's scoring -- brilliant though it is in all the cuts I'd seen of the film -- offered a bit more Newman flair.

And now, I'm extremely gratified to say, my wishes have nearly all come true.

This restoration print is phenomenal.  Yes there are some washed-out scenes, but I don't care.  They are finally back where they belong. This roadshow restoration was printed from a Todd-AO master negative and is a considerably DIFFERENT film from the one most of us have been exposed to the past 49 years.

The print is magnificent, clear and in many ways looks better than most new films look today.

This roadshow version resonates for me in ways that the theatrical cut never did.  Time and again, the music set my heart racing, my pulse throbbing, and my senses went into overload.

This film is a visual and aural feast.  It's also now my favorite film musical EVER!

Color filters?  Bah!  Get over 'em!  I read somewhere that cinematographer Leon Shamroy wanted them for the purpose of achieving/enhancing emotional responses to scenes.  Other sources say it was director Joshua Logan who insisted on using them, primarily because he had experimented with such things in the Broadway production.  I know many responses have been sheer hatred/disdain for all the filters, but I love many of them.  Those I don't I ignore.

I've read/heard a lot of hoo-haw about the casting of Nellie Forbush (including the highly negative and wishy-washy commentary by Richard Barrios, a film historian whose commentary is replete with ""people"" have said -- ""many people"", ""some people"", ""people"", ""a friend"", ""someone""...all in the negative...and always attributing his negativity to unnamed others.  He seemingly owns nothing he says, but doesn't mind repeating what he has heard. This depletes him of any sort of authority on the subject. It's unfathomable to me that a studio would afflict a restoration of one of its most profitable movies with such absurd negativity...especially given the film's many admirers).

Much has been discussed about why Mary Martin and Ezio Pinza did not recreate their roles.  One of the features on the second disc will show you why -- check out the numbers performed in that 1954 Rodgers and Hammerstein TV tribute (three years before filming began on the movie version).  Martin looks to be somewhere in her  40s (she was 51)...and matronly plump -- and Pinza (who was 62) looks terrible (and totally unromantic-leadish).  You can get away with a lot on stage, but you cannot hide such things on camera.  I doubt that Martin was EVER considered for the role. And Pinza died in 1957.

Mary Martin was a great, shining star of the Broadway musical theater.  She had a lightly raspy singing voice that she invested with great emotional nuance and feeling.  I am a huge fan of Martin's and mean her no disrespect in my observations above.

Barrios maintains that Mitzi Gaynor's voice was not in Martin's league.  I'm not sure what he means by that because to my ears, Gaynor's voice is leagues better than Martin's in quality and range.  He may be saying he felt Martin's intepretation of the songs was better (and he comes off as one of those somewhat snooty theatrical drama mavens for whom nothing translated to the screen from the theater will ever be good enough, but I disagree with virtually everything that comes out of his mouth on the commentary so I won't mention him again).

There is talk that Elizabeth Taylor was a candidate.  What a blessing THAT never happened.

The other great ""sigh-in-the-sky"" complaint is that Doris Day would have been perfect as Nellie but that she turned off Joshua Logan at a party one night when she refused to get up and sing for guests.  I'd always heard she refused to audition for Richard Rodgers.

At any rate...I certainly cannot imagine Doris Day, with her all-too-familiar mannerisms, as Nellie Forbush in ""South Pacific.""  I know she had the look, but I think Gaynor was by far the best choice of those considered for the role.

Many will strongly disagree.  And many of those will be the same folks who still bemoan the loss of Frank Sinatra as Billy Bigelow in ""Carousel.""  The visual imagery of that casting still induces giggles.  That slight, skinny man wearing a barker's cap and being a rugged barker on a carousel?  I think Hollywood dodged a HUGE misfire when he walked out on that film.

Watch Gaynor's performance closely in this roadshow version -- she is luminous, she is restrained, she is exuberant.  She is up to the task in every scene and pulls off some incredibly difficult scenes with great dramatic effect.  Her vocals are magnificent.

And the huge surprise for me:  Ray Walston is wonderful as Luther Billis. They restored much footage of him ...much of what was missing was character development and nuances.  In the cut version we saw only the more hyper/extreme elements of his performance.  This restored Luther Billis is terrific, and Walston owns the role!

Being a film music fan of many, many decades (!), I have to say that it's always the music that counts most for me in any musical (not to mention any other kind of film), but ""South Pacific"" is Alfred Newman's masterpiece.  He took a classic Broadway score and made it shine more gloriously than it had ever shone before.  It's thrilling beyond words to have Newman's original scoring returned to the film...many glorious flourishes pop up frequently to great effect...the entire segments like Cable's walk through the jungle of Bali Ha'i with Bloody Mary -- an entire chunk of film with an entire chunk of original music restored (the Newman scoring of this chunk brings to mind the opening music in the vision sequence in ""The Song of Bernadette"", but with exotic colorings employed rather than religious ones). Newman's work set a standard that has never been remotely approached by anyone but Newman himself (in ""Camelot"").  The choral direction of Ken Darby, Newman's right hand man, is inspired.  ""Bali Hai'"" never had a presentation on Broadway like the one in the film.  On stage, it's anothe great song, but on film it becomes magic.

I cannot recommend the restored roadshow version of ""South Pacific"" more highly.  See it (and IGNORE ENTIRELY the accompanying commentary).",1174176000,67,6957,4.778523489932886

C'mon, people. Lighten up. I'm not a big fan of musicals, but this is a good movie. I do agree the use of colored filters was grossly overworked. It's like garlic: a little is a little good; a lot is not a lot of good, and the director definitely over-did it. But to criticize Rossano Brazzi's accent because it was Italian instead of French is being quite picky. He was supposed to lend a certain ""continental"" air to his role, and he did. And musicals are supposed to be fantasies of a sort, so you have to use some imagination. If you want realism, you shouldn't look to a musical, after all, how many times have you been around a group of people in real life who suddenly broke into song and dance, all perfectly choreographed, of course?

The thing I found absolutely DUMB, DUMB, DUMB was the anti-racism message. I thought it was hokey in 1959 when I first saw this movie, and I still do. Neither incident made sense. First, we have sweet and petite Nellie Forbush from Little Rock, AR, falling in love with a Frenchman; but when she finds out he was once married to a native woman (now deceased) and the two kids she adores were the native woman's, a racist streak a mile wide goes up her spine. Kinda hard to believe, even for 1959.

Then there is Lt. Joe Cable from Philadelphia, PA. He meets and falls instantly (if not sooner) in love with an absolutely gorgeous native girl. He sweeps her into his arms, sings ""Younger Than Springtime"", and kisses her. Later he makes other visits to her, and they swim in a swimming hole, hugging and kissing underwater. There not being any jewelry stores on the islands, he gives her his family heirloom watch that his father and grandfather carried in prior wars. Now, one would naturally think this was leading up to a marriage proposal, and it did, but not by Cable  . . .  by Liat's mother. He suddenly realizes  . . . guess what!!! . . . HER EYES ARE SLANTED and their children will have slanted eyes! Dang that racist streak!

Although these inconsistencies don't make sense to me, perhaps I should use my imagination; after all it is a musical.

The one thing I found offensive is the notion that only whites can be racists. But that's Hollywood . . . always beating up on its own who made it rich.

I am still surprised at how many of the male actors in minor roles went on to have successful careers, but I did not see the same weight of subsequently successful female actors.  The music is flawless.  I agree the filters are distracting, but that is not reason enough for anyone to deny themselves the pleasure of this musical.

The movie is one of the most beautifully filmed I have ever seen and the sound is perfect, not the mention the perfection of the music itself.  Stop talking about the color filters and look beyond it to enjoy the movie itself.  I did not agree with the gentleman's assessment of Mary Martin's performance being superior to Mitzi Gaynor, who I found to be great in the film.  Did you see the clip of Mary Martin?  Good grief!  Other than that, I found the commentary to be very interesting.  The extras were wonderful as well, especially the 60 Minutes interview.  I was a little disappointed that the ""Making of"" documentary was not new.  Still, the film has so many great messages and is beautiful to watch and I am now a big fan of Mitzi Gaynor!",1170115200,3,905,4.365269461077844
2641953,5,B000HT3PGK,"I grew up watching the Saturday night movie musicals on our local PBS station. One of my all time favorites was and still is South Pacific.

Mitzi Gaynor shines as Nellie Forbush. She puts her heart and soul into the performance. I especially like the number ""Gonna Wash That Man Right Outta My Hair."" Rossano Brazzi is excellant as Emele DeBeck, the plantation owner who wins Nellie's heart. Juanita Hall is a gem as Bloody Mary. Her rendition of ""Bali Ha'i"" still sends goosebumps down my spine. Ray Walston provides the needed comic relief through the sailor, Luther Billis. The location footage which was filmed in Hawaii is breathtaking while the musical score from Rogers and Hammerstein is brilliant.

2641955,5,B000HT3PGK,This is one of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals that sometimes gets overlooked and I'm glad that it's finally been released on DVD.  I also own the DVD of South Pacific in Concert at Carnegie Hall and I love it.  Reba McEntire and Brian Stokes Mitchell are worthy successors to Mitzi Gaynor and Rossano Brazzi.  I have seen the version of South Pacific on television with Glenn Close and I don't think she was right for the part of Nellie Forbush.  I didn't think that her singing was all that good.,1168300800,4,503,4.4945054945054945

2641958,4,B000HT3PGK,"The music of SOUTH PACIFIC is so magical and irresistable that it overcomes many of the problems with the film.  Since the film is not going to change, you must either accept the use of the color filters or just reject the film altogether.  There are many fine reviews of the film, so I will limit myself to the first-ever issue of the roadshow version.  While it contains many charming scenes, mostly with Ray Walston and Juanita Hall, all of the inclusions are incidental rather than revelatory.  I knew that the full version of ""I'm Gonna Wash That man..""

was not even included in the roadshow version, but I had hoped that some plot points would have been cleared up.  We still don't know why Lt. Cable

was in the hospital or how Luther Billis ended up with DeBeque's flowers to hand them to Nellie after the ""Honey Bun"" number.  The DVD states that the overall quality of the cut scenes are noticeably inferior to the standard version, and they are.  However, as a digital restorer myself, I know that the color could have been improved to the point where it could have at least matched the original, albeit more grainy.

The worst aspect of the road show version is the unending and overly chatty commentary by Richard Barrios.  He introduces himself as a film lecturer and expert in movie musicals.  He then begins to identify the John Kerr character as ""Bill"" Cable (his name is Joe) which immediately diminishes his credibility.  More than once is an excursion into the correct pronunciation of John Kerr's last name, extraneous commentary about other films, even ""Birth of a Nation"", and, of course, endless reaction to the color filters well after his point has been made.

Despite everything I have always loved this film and the glorious music, (I have sung the role of DeBebeque in community theater) and this roadshow version is a weclome addition for film buffs and the fans of SOUTH PACIFIC.  Maybe somewhere in some vault are all of the missing sequences that were edited before the original release.",1164326400,3,2020,4.731428571428571
2641959,5,B000HT3PGK,"I can understand other reviewers comments on how the Road Show version of SOUTH PACIFIC isn't totally what it should be with the splicing in of poorer-quality material based on what was available.  As stated on the menu prior to the start of the film, quality available prints of the missing pieces are lost.  I was glad to see what they could do to restore the film with the missing pieces.  To me, even with faded segments added in, most are not bad at all.  The only horrible portion was at the beginning of Act 2 when Liat is running down the jungle hills to meet Joe Cable running up from the beach. This very short segment is horrible and shakes so, it looks like an earthquake was happening during filming and was left in.  It is also most horribly faded over the other sections used.  For this maybe 10 seconds of film, I would have left it out.  Adding the other missing good pieces makes the story flow a bit better.  I missed on my first scan the longer segment with Bloody Mary giving the sailor heck when he didn't buy something from her, which now completes that scene for me, as revival versions of the stage play had this complete version as presented now, only with saltier dialog.  You couldn't say what Bloody Mary said in the play in the film when it was released.  In today's world, it would be nothing compared to what you hear in films now.

This edition states Collector's Edition as it is not an official 50th Anniversary like King and I and Carousel, which were both issued in 1956.  Maybe in two years, Fox will surprise us again for SP's 50th with more stuff.  In the extras, I was very impressed with the original Making of South Pacific short film.  I thought it would be a current documentary, but in actuality, it was made while the film was being created.  What a difference Kauai was in th late 50's to what I saw in 2000.  I visited the beach with the pier where Joe Cable lands and the Seebees are introduced.  Looks almost the same, but more inhabited now.  I also found the area, and perhaps the actual plateau where Emile's patio has that view over those twisted palm trees.  There is a hotel/condo there, and now many houses on that hillside, so over time, all of that patio and trees were probably removed.  From the hotel parking and grounds, you still see that vista and high cliff in the distance, plus the bay out to the ocean.  From this Making Of film, you see alternate shots of some of the performances, some of what may be the longer version of ""Wash That Man Right Out Of My Hair"", and a place where I think it is Josh Logan swimming in the churning Pacific around rocks, which could be where the Grand Hyatt Kauai now rests, as the rock formations looked like those at their ocean beach.

Only started on the Michener piece from 60 Minutes.  Will complete tonight, but have to get over Diane Sawyer's hairdo.  She looks better today.

One thing that is not mentioned is that Rosanno Brazzi's singing is dubbed, as the opening credits state ""The Voice of Giorgio Tozzi"".  There is nothing about his participation in the film, or a photo of him.  Do not know if John Kerr was dubbed, but probably ""was"".

It is a nice effort by Fox to offer this complete edition.  For the general release portion, and that used of it in the Road Show edition, the technicolor is superb, as is the remastered sound.  Don't know what the THX remastering did to the last issue DVD, but the sound is so much clearer on this new issue.  I've heard intruments with such clarity that I couldn't hear on the older DVD version.

Worth it.",1163635200,9,3563,4.408882082695253

8141232,5,B000HT3PGK,"Based on James Michener's book `Tales of the South Pacific', this Rodgers & Hammerstein's play is adapted for the big screen.

There are overlapping stories of different people with extremely different backgrounds and how the cope or not with each other in a time of adversity during the second world war in the south pacific.

This is a musical and the songs (most have the feel of the 50's, others are timeless) tell the story best of all. Be sure to also obtain the soundtrack.

Different colored filters are used in filming this movie to give you different atmospheric feelings to match the songs. It also poses a sort of dream like quality to the story.

You will recognize that many of the best actors of the time were picked. This includes recently deceased Ray Walston who played Luther Billis.

There was some decision to do some dubbing of the songs; however it does not distract form the ambiance of the film or the nature of the story.

So prepare to be absorbed in the Tales of the South Pacific.",1496275200,,1009,4.5777777777777775
8141233,5,B000HT3PGK,"One of the great experiences of my life. The film is head and shoulders above any other version of this masterpiece. Thank God, Mary Martin was not cast as Forbush. Mitzi Gaynor is perfect in the role. I did not know until I read a review on here that Elizabeth Taylor had been considered for the part. Mon Dieu! deliver us. If you have suffered through a local production of this musical in your hometown, you owe it to yourself to see this definitive version. I could go on forever, but this movie holds up; the wonderful ""West Side Story"" does not ; it is terribly dated, but there is something  special about the movie version of ""South Pacific"" that guarantees that it will be younger than springtime for years to come. I had to see it in 1959 to see what all the fuss was about. It seemed to run forever in the major theaters of the time.. But even with high expectations, I was unprepared for the treat that unfolded on the wide screen in my first STEREOPHONIC movie, which by the way, added immeasurably to the total effect.  This movie opened my eyes to the potential of the lyric  stage, and I have moved on into opera and Wagner,
but  ""South Pacific"" will always hold a special place for me. Although having said that, ""South Pacific"" is itself ""pure opera"" in the ""Twin Soliloquies/ Some Enchanted Evening"" segment. I know ""Oklahoma"" was praised for its --very embarrassing-- ballet sequence with Rod Steiger (!) because it introduced dance into a musical comedy in a new way, wherein the story was supposed to have been advanced by the ballet sequence instead of halted by it. When I saw it--and I confess I do not like ""Oklahoma"" anymore than I like the ""Sound of Music,"" --I thought the ballet had just the opposite of the intended effect. It drew attention to itself in an unflattering way. But ""Twin Soliloquies"" pulled me right into the wonderful ""Some Enchanted Evening"": I felt the conflicted emotions of both characters, and I felt the attraction that led into the enchantment they succumbed to.

""South Pacific"" will forever be as fresh to me as it was in 1959.",1493683200,,2083,4.57372654155496
