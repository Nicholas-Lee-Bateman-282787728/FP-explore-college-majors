1904021,4,B0000A9D4A,"The blind ronin Zatoichi wanders from town to town where he makes his living giving massages and spends his leisure gambling.  Often Zatoichi is perceived as a blind helpless victim, but make no mistake here as he is the deadliest of all swordsmen.  In this adventure, Zatoichi enters a small town besieged by two rival gangs that are fighting for control.  When Zatoichi enters the town a mighty ronin arrives simultaneously looking for a good paying job that can help finance the cure for his sick wife.  Also, two murderous geishas arrive and infiltrate the underworld with death in their minds.  Zatoichi ends up in the middle of this ordeal where he functions as the evenhanded police, judge, and executioner for the town's villains by delivering death to those who does wrong.  Zatoichi is visually dazzling and aurally sophisticated as it enhances the understanding for the dark world which Zatoichi experiences daily.  This results in a fantastic adventure where right and wrong are well balanced under the blind eye of Zatoichi, leaving the audience with a good cinematic experience.",1085443200,6,1092,5.067039106145251

1904046,2,B0000A9D4A,"This remake of the Blind Swordsman is a miserable thing.  While there was always an element of humour in the Blind Swordsman films, it was up compared to this, relatively subtle.  Here the humerus played in an almost vaudevillian or slapstick fashion.  There is too much mugging and playing for the cameras, and too little story and far too little acting.  No wonder this film went over like a lead balloon in Japan.",1499644800,,416,4.657534246575342
1904047,3,B0000A9D4A,"I was such a fan of the TV series that I decided to buy the movie. And as much as I liked the movie, I did take exception to a couple of things. Predominantly the fact that none of the swordsmen ever seem to be inclined to clean their sword after having made use of it. Which is just as out of character of a swordsman as I can even imagine. If you sheath a sword before cleaning it, blood is wiped off on the inside of the sheath. Blood is human tissue,  and it will ROT (decompose) on the inside of the sheath making the sheath unusable. Or at least very unpleasant to use, because of the smell of the rotting tissue. Also, if there's enough blood on the blade when it is sheathed then it will be next to impossible to withdraw the blade from the sheath,  come time to use it again ...  the blood will have glued the blade to the inside of the sheath. You would think that a culture so steeped in the use of swords could get the details right.

Four stars for the story, less one for the error in the details.",1496793600,,1011,4.04

1904061,1,B0000A9D4A,"This is a poorly done remake of a great film that became a beloved series in Japan. This film appears to be competing with US slasher films to see who can use the most fake blood and gore. The original Zatoichi films are well done with plenty of action sans blood spraying and pouring everywhere.
Add to that the fact that the wonderful character from the original films is replaced by an actor who obviously has some kind of neurological problem that causes him to blink incessantly which is much much more than a little distracting. This film is an insult to the beloved actor who starred in the series and to those who followed and enjoyed it. Don't waste your money on this trash.",1441238400,,684,4.48

1904064,2,B0000A9D4A,"What can I say?  I hated this movie.  It was like watching some evil, unlikeable doppelganger pantomiming the real Zatoichi.  He does not have the heart and soul of Shintaro Katsu, the REAL Zatoichi.  I've grown very attached to the Ichi character.  He can be like an innocent child, dancing around, kicking his feet forward, buying candy for the village children, coyly blushing in the presence of a woman, changing a baby's diaper, wrestling with children in an orphanage and crying when having to give over a child he was temporarily fostering.  He's also a selfless hero, always fighting evil and injustice with little thanks.  And deep within, he's a vicious killer when all other options fail.  Its fun watching a character like Ichi, no matter what situation he's in.  Beat Takeshi's Zatoichi is less the hero and likeable bumpkin and more of a self absorbed, jaded, anti-social individual.  In an interview, he said he sees Zatoichi as more of a villain then anything else.  And that unfortunately is what you see in his performance.  The story was so-so and the characters were all two dimensional.  You have a Yakuza boss, the torn samurai, some village idiot who runs around screaming and even a transvestite for good measure.  Sadly none of these characters make any real connection with Ichi.  Worse, the blood is like fake CGI and really takes you out of the film (though the director claims he did this on purpose).  And why is his hair blond?  I give it two stars because the fight scenes were good and the ending was a crack up.",1433203200,,1545,4.726591760299626

Film was entertaining, fun, colorful and i hope there wil be a follow-up! This is a very different type of film icompared to previous Kitano's works. Please try to see it.",1414108800,,307,5.285714285714286
1904076,4,B0000A9D4A,"Japanese megastar Beat Takeshi (Takeshi Kitano) set out to make a Zatoichi film that was different from the rest, of which there are many. They include a TV series that ran for 100 episodes and a series of 26 films, both starring Shintaro Katsu, who himself became a star owing to his portrayal of the blind swordsman and masseur.

Takeshis version follows a standard plot: Ichi wanders into a small town and takes on yakuza thugs who are terrorizing the village and extracting protection money from the townspeople. The Ginzo gang are in a rivalry with two other gangs. The Ginzo boss hires a traveling ronin, Hattori, to settle the score.

Meanwhile, two sisters (one of them a man in drag), are posing as geisha and waiting for a chance to take revenge on the gang that killed their parents. As the story unfolds, Ichi dispatches the bad guys, including the hired assassin Hattori, with his sword cane.

Kitanos acting style is minimalist, with little in the way of facial expression or dialogue, a trademark of Kitanos films. Lots of blood is another feature of his action films, at least the ones I have seen. If the sight of blood upsets you, this film is definitely not for you.

There are some amusing scenes mixed in with all the swordplay. One of the two geisha who are trying to revenge their father was a man in drag, and towards the end when the villains have been killed off and another character says, you can become a man again, s/he answers, Im fine like this.

The film closes with a spectacular dance event with taiko drums and dozens of kimonoed dancers in geta clogging away like Irish step dancers, a kind of Riverdance meets the Kodo Drummers. Other reviewers have found this scene out of place or superfluous. For my money, this was worth the price of the film.

Zatoichi comes bundled with Sonatine, a mediocre yakuza thriller. Unless you are a die-hard devotee of the genre, Id suggest giving this one a pass.",1408924800,,1935,4.626822157434402
1904077,5,B0000A9D4A,I really enjoyed this film I really enjoyed the poetic license that they took with the character. You may read reviews where people describe zatoichi as a blind samurai and he is not a samurai at all he was never a samurai ever. He used to be yakuza and he was never a samurai. Just because it's an Asian guy and he's using the sword does not make him a samurai I don't understand why people can't understand is that basic just common sense. It actually really bothers me when people call him a blind samurai they clearly have no idea what they're talking about I wonder if they even paid attention to the film,1408320000,,610,4.3130434782608695

1904083,5,B0000A9D4A,"I love this movie and I had lost my original copy that I bought nearly a decade ago. I recently got the bug to watch this again and so I went and bought the blu-ray version. I watched it thinking I was going to get a strong, pure, clean and sharp 1080p picturesque quality instead what I got was an over saturated, off color picture that took a lot of the beauty of the film out and it looked drowned over blended. So I sold that one on Ebay and bought the old DVD version and it is just beautiful as I remember.

Fantastic movie all around especially if you are big of either Zatoichi and/or Takeshi Kitano fan. I highly recommend that you buy the much cheaper DVD than the Blu-Ray that is available now  (as of 5-10-2014). The only problem with watching this DVD on a good HDTV is that the shoddy special effects are a lot more noticeable this time around and it might take a bit of the enjoyment out. I still love the movie but I would be disingenuous if I didn't say that it did take me out of the movie at times.",1399680000,,1017,4.105527638190955
1904084,1,B0000A9D4A,"Don't watch this. It's LAME.  Doesn't focus on developing characters. Doesn't round out Zatoichi. Very big disappointment.

1904085,5,B0000A9D4A,"I have been looking for this version of Zatoichi for three years and to finally find it with a bonus second film
Sonatine included  was the iceing on the cake. Takeshi Kitano's version of a blond Zatoichi is over the top,
Well acted the fight choreography is totally different, not long and drawn out but one lightning slash with
his sward cane and it's over. the sound score is also interesting during the field workers and the house
rebuilding sequences. The film ends with the entire cast in a dance routine and a gag shot of Zatoichi
at the start of rhe credits. Sonatine is also a good showing of Kitano's talent as a hit man for the mob.",1390348800,2,643,4.4033613445378155

1904091,5,B0000A9D4A,"Zatoichi finds himself in a small village - a village caught in a gang war - where he befriends a farmer and her nephew; along the way, he also agrees to help two geishas in their quest for revenge. Zatoichi is a masterfully-made, highly entertaining film.

Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman drops you right into the action. It's a very traditional yet immensely interesting samurai story; it's a samurai film that blends its drama and action very well. Zatoichi shows up at a time of violence and oppression for the townspeople, and slowly helps as he bonds with those he meets - whether it be the geishas seeking revenge for their family's slaughter or the kind farmer forced to pay excessive amounts for protection. The action sequences are superb and often intense, especially the samurai showdowns. Zatoichi stays mysterious as masseur, which I also enjoyed. The ending of this film was odd yet great - I enjoyed it vastly as it added cultural depth and was very original.

The acting was fantastic from the entire cast. Beat Takeshi is amazing as the mysterious samurai, Zatoichi. The music in the film is great, especially the ending, which is paired with a great dance sequence. The costumes and settings are great. I also enjoyed most the visual effects. The splashing computer blood gave the film a comic book/manga vibe; however, the gore effects were bad, and often distracting. Fortunately, the gore is limited to a few scenes, so it wasn't a significant issue. I own the Miramax Blu-ray of the film, and it looks and sounds great; definitely worth owning, if you can find a copy.

Overall, Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman is a very entertaining samurai tale; the performances, the music, the action all create an immersive and authentic atmosphere. Highly recommended for fans of the genre.

Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman has strong blood and violence.",1374537600,2,1860,4.932907348242812

1904107,5,B0000A9D4A,"This movie is great on several fronts.

1) Kitano's musical sense of choreography adds depth to this movie... I was very impressed by the way he made music with farming tools.

2) Zatoichi is a classic character in Japanese film - but he was never blonde. The fact that Kitano gets away with a blonde Zatoichi is proof that the story and acting is convincing regardless.

3) The harmony created by the intertwining of so many lives and so many life stories makes this movie so much more than just a ""good conquers evil"" simple flick.

Zatoichi is not as violent as Hanabi or the other Kitano flicks - or so it feels.
And it is not at all a classic samurai film or a hero flick.
Yes, Zatoichi is am amazing swordsman and yes, he helps to deliver some poetic justice... but the story is just so much more than that.",1352073600,2,813,4.328947368421052

Don't get me wrong, the performance was actually good but the ""up to date"" dance sequence (including almost all of the characters in the movie along with professional dancers) was very out of place. There is a stick beating dance before the tap dancing that felt more likely of a performance for the time period but in the Behind the Scenes, they say they wanted to do something more for the current age. I do not agree but it is my own opinion.
The movie from start to finish is excellent. Takeshi Kitano really surprised me by his spead and proficiency with his cane sword. The CG blood spurting that was added during sword fights may be frowned upon by some old school fans but I felt it really added to the realism of when someone truly gets large cuts in a sword fight. They touch on this issue in the Behind the Scenes as well.
When I watched it, it defaulted to English dialogue and I didn't change it back to Japanese so I cannot comment on the difference between the 2. The english dialogue seemed fine to me and wasn't Engrish sounding (LOL).
Supporting characters were also performed very well as well. The gambling man that takes him in, the 2 Geishas (with secrets of their own) and even the simple minded man running about the town weilding a spear (as though he is going to war) kept you entertained when you weren't watching Zatoichi himself. They say that the comedy in this film was there because a movie that is all blood shed and sword fights isn't that entertaining. I agreed.
I am happy I bought the movie and recommend it to anyone who has a liking for Samurai movies.",1286236800,,1750,4.454828660436137

1904125,4,B0000A9D4A,"I don't generally review movies due to lack of time. But having just finished watching the movie and reading some of the comments made here, I have a few things to add. First, I have seen most if not all of the Zatoichi films. In fact I've just started collecting them. I highly enjoy them even though the production values, the black and white, etc. are dated.

This is certainly not the original. And for many fans of Shintaro Katsu, they' ll hate it. But if you let it stand on it's own merits it is fun in it's quirkiness. Certainly it should not be taken seriously, maybe only as a homage to the original. SPOILER and for the individual who said at the end it turns out Zatoichi isn't even blind, he must of actually not seen it to the end because there is a second revelation where Zatoichi says that even though he can open his eyes he actually is blind.

So while this certainly isn't a great film, and equally not a great Zatoichi one for some of the reasons noted elsewhere, it is an entertaining popcorn film. And I would hope that it might encourage some of it's viewers to go back to the originals, which I can recommend highly.",1280534400,,1141,4.327102803738318

1904133,1,B0000A9D4A,"OK, let me get this straight: the disc comes with a documentary where the director of photography EXPLICITLY details how and why the director agreed to go with a desaturated color palette for this film. Unfortunately for him, the American version of this disc simply chose to ignore their wishes, saturating the color to make the film look ""normal"" for American audiences (since we are a bunch of neophytes who could not understand that the color was desaturated on purpose).  Joe six-pack apparently also wants films that have been oversharpened, distorting the original film look. This, and not providing us with a high quality version of the original Japanese soundtrack (naturally that is reserved for the dubbed English version, since, again, American audiences cannot bother to read subtitles or care about hearing the original language of the film) make this version of the film on Blu-Ray a slap to the face of any discerning film lover.",1255824000,56,945,5.0576923076923075

I saw this first on TV, but it was slashed to pieces by all the commercial breaks.
Worth adding to your permanent collection if you like movies where the underdog whips butt in style. I would almost compare this to some of Kurasawa's masterpieces. All done with a wry bit of humor that endears the character to you.
What's also nice is the blind swordsman is middle-aged and also does massage.

1904135,4,B0000A9D4A,"I'm a big fan of Japanese samuri movies.  While for the most part an updated and fun continuation of the Zatoichi series, the use of poor quality special effects seriously dampered by ethusiam.  Let me explain.

During sword fight scenes, most of the time Zatoichi's sword is actually a digital special effect as are the limb severings and cuts.  On the upside, this allows for much more complex techniques than could perhaps be done in the traditional manner.  The down side is that the sword, blood, and limbs being severed are so poorly rendered and obviously fake that it detracts from the realism of the scene.  If a fighting move is patently false, it undercuts the ability of the audience to believe in the swordsmanship of the character.  It's like if Clint Eastwood quickdrawed in his Westerns, but his gun looked like a cartoon gun inked in.

I think this film would have been much better, and more realistic, if they had used props rather than digital effects.

Otherwise, I found the characters to be engaging, and the dance sequence at the end was highly entertaining.",1254182400,2,1081,4.768817204301075
1904136,3,B0000A9D4A,"A modernized samurai film and who best to create such a film that would appeal on a worldwide level, what better than  Takeshi Kitano aka Takeshi Beat.

""The Blind Swordsman: Zatoichi"" is written and directed by Takeshi Kitano and is based on the novels by Kan Shimosawa.  The film would go on to win many awards worldwide and receive positive reviews amongst the critics but would achieve success because of its modern-take on the samurai genre.  Needless to say, Kitano fans have been waiting for another brilliant film from the popular actor/director and the film definitely received worldwide respect.

In Japan, Takeshi Kitano is one of those talents that can be seen on television via a variety show, a serious talk show and radio show and mostly a comedic talent that is known for making people laugh or bringing out subjects that people in Japan, often don't want talk about.  But a a filmmaker, Kitano is world renown.  From his role in ""Taboo"", ""Hana-bi"", ""Battle Royale"", ""Brother"" and ""Dolls"".

Known for also being tough in his yakuza-genre based films, he also shown his resilience after bouncing back from a nearly fatal motorcycle accident that paralyzed one side of his boy.

Although a celebrated filmmaker, Kitano is known to do things his way and his style and in 2003, he intended to do just that for a samurai film based on Shintaro Katsu's ""Zatoichi"" TV series.  But again, in Kitano's style and not redoing things that people have already seen in the TV series.  To give his own spin and also to not make things serious by utilizing CG-blood, Kitano would also have blonde hair and most interesting is that the film included a dance number at the end of the film.

""The Blind Swordsman: Zatoichi"" features Takeshi Kitano as Zatoichi, a samurai who is blind but wanders around the country using his senses to win at gambling and also his skills as a masseuse.  But he's also, a samurai with tremendous skills and is a man who is known to protect the innocent and those who have been hurt or oppressed.

In this film, he enters a town which has suffered from the various Yakuza gangs and business owners are expected to pay them from monthly to weekly for ""protection money"".  Unfortunately, a lot of these business owners are unable to afford to live with the earnings minus what they owe to the Yakuza and if they try to stand up to the Yakuza, they are either killed or beaten.

One of the women who has dealt with the Yakuza is Aunt Oome (Michiyo Ookusu) who has taken Zatoichi into her home temporarily.

Meanwhile, we learn of a talented ronin samurai named Hattori Genosuke (Tadanobu Asano) who has a wife that is sick and willing to take any job.  Desperate in trying to make money to pay for medicine, he takes a job as an assassin for one of the Yakuza gangs (who are planning to eliminate the other two gangs and take sole control of the financial resources).

One night, Aunt Oome talks about the Yakuza's who try to take money from the farmers and also about her nephew Shinkichi who is a hardcore gambler.  With Zatoichi being a big gambler himself, he wants to check out the various gambling spots in town.  He manages to meet Shinkichi at the gambling area but also surprises him by his wins through using his heightened senses and the two end up becoming friends.

While the two continue to gamble, we are then introduced to two Geishas named Osei (Daigoro Tachibana) and Geisha Okinu (Yuko Daike) who appear to be geisha's that commit murder.

While becoming lucky at the gambling hall, both Zatoichi and Shinkichi go to celebrate their winnings and eventually look for some fun visiting various geisha but instead hook up with the two murdering Geisha's but Zatoichi quickly senses that these two are not who they think they are.

We learn that both geisha are actually brother and sister who want revenge after the Yakuza who killed their entire family.  Due to circumstances, the four may end up needing to team up with each other, as each become targets of the Yakuza.

But for Zatoichi, he has heard enough of the oppression by this Yakuza group and the target becomes the Yakuza.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""The Blind Swordsman: Zatoichi"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1) and comes with mix results.  Disney Blu-rays are typically known for their quality picture and audio quality but ""Zatoichi"" has been DNR'd (digital noise reduction) but not excessively.

Also, there are signs of edge enhancement as well and makes you wonder if the original film was in bad shape.  Nevertheless, it would have been nice to have a more detailed image quality with its original grain but nevertheless, the picture quality is not vibrant as I have hoped.  But for the most part, picture quality leans more to good than great.

As for audio quality, this is a heart-breaker as this is another film released by Disney that only the English dubbed track is featured in lossless DTS-HD quality (48 kHz/24-bit).  Granted, the film's English dub is actually quite good and I found it interesting that even during the dub, the voice talent tend to pronounce some Japanese words with the R and L's and even adding the silent ""u"" after certain words.  But compared to other Asian films that have been released via English dub, this one is one of the best (along with ""HERO"").

With the lossless track, some scenes utilize surround during the rain scenes but for the most part, the film is a front and center channel driven film.  Dialogue and music is clear and the ending dance performance really features a wonderful musical soundtrack.

But for many of us who enjoy Asian films, we prefer to watch the film in its original language and unfortunately the Japanese is only featured in 5.1 Dolby Digital (Spanish 2.0 Dolby Digital is also included).  It would have been nice to hear this film in its original language via lossless but at least it was offered.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""The Blind Swordsman: Zatoichi"" comes with the following two special features (in 480i, English 2.0 Dolby Digital, English SDH and Spanish subtitles):

  * Behind-the-Scenes Special - (35:55) An informative behind-the-scenes featurette showing the viewers of the first press conference, shooting throughout the various weeks from start to finish and then the premiere of the films at the film festivals.  Featuring interviews with director/writer/actor Takeshi Kitano and the cast members.
  * Exclusive Interviews with Crew - Featuring individual interviews with Katsumi Yanagishima (Cinematographer), Norihiro Isoda (Production Designer), Kazuko Kurosawa (Costume Supervisor), Tatsumi Nikamoto (Master Swordsman).

JUDGMENT CALL:

""The Blind Swordsman: Zatoichi"" is one of those films that you can't help but enjoy.  In fact, I have enjoyed this film so much that I don't know many times I've watched it.  I really enjoyed the modernizing of the samurai film and respect Kitano not wanting to emulate the classic but to do something different for the modern crowd.

Where the classic samurai films will always be there, Kitano wanted to bring some energy into the film with adding humor after major battle scenes, making the blood after a person gets slashed via CG but how it sprays, his goal was to make it more artistic.  But possibly the most surprising of the film is how it ends with a beautiful dance.  Where many samurai films end with the lone samurai leaving and happy villagers celebrating, he wanted to showcase that celebration through a more modernized Japanese dance that would include tap dancing.

I know for some hardcore samurai film fans, they may have a hard time seeing ""Zatoichi"" so far from the original television series but knowing Kitano's films and his humor, this was definitely one of those films that has his style but also capturing the spirit of those classic samurai films.

As much as I have loved the film, I still have some problems with the Blu-ray release and its decision to feature it via DNR for the picture quality and to find out that the original Japanese language is not in lossless audio but for the most part, Disney is not the only one who has done this as other Asian (especially anime) films or television shows feature the original language without the lossless audio.

But by no means is this a bad Blu-ray release, the picture quality is not terrible and truthfully, with the videophiles as the exception, most viewers may feel the picture quality to be clean and satisfactory and as for the English dub, for those who hate reading subtitles can find solace in knowing there is a solid English dub included.  I'm not so much into dubs but I have to admit that ""The Blind Swordsman: Zatoichi"" does have a solid English dub.

Overall, ""The Blind Swordsman: Zatoichi"" is not going to be anywhere near reference quality nor will it be up there for great Blu-ray releases but for fans of the ""Zatoichi"", it's still a wonderful film that is worth checking out!",1252972800,9,8915,4.811679790026247
1904137,3,B0000A9D4A,"In early 2004 I saw Takeshi Kitano's ZATOICHI in the local cinema, intrigued by a Japanese feature but knowing nothing of the long tradition of films with Zatoichi, the blind swordsman. I never did see the earlier films with Shintaro Katsu, but I continue to enjoy Takeshi Kitano's take on the character. The plot is fairly basic, rival gangs are fighting for control of a small town, and the locals are obliged to pay increasing amounts protection money. Into this steps Zatoichi, played by Takeshi himself, as well as another itinerant swordsman who seeks to do the dirty work of one of the gangs in order to help his sick wife. Zatoichi falls in with a poor farmer, as do two geishas who are traveling about to get revenge on the gang members who killed their parents. Over the course of the films, Zatoichi proceeds to slay an enormous amount of people, with some vivid CGI blood painted over each fatal sword blow. In spite of the generic setup, the production values and a few of the twists in the story make this an enjoyable film.

I know that Takeshi has been criticized for completely doing away with the back story around Zatoichi. Here the only sign that he has a past at all is when a gang member says, ""Could this blind man be Zatoichi"", and a flashback where he silently kills a group of nameless foes. Instead, Takeshi brings the character between the two extremes of charming, but taciturn, old blind man and unstoppable killing machine. But nonetheless, I like how universal the Zatoichi character is, even when he is as mechanical as Kitano sometimes makes him. The archetype of the man of piercing intelligence who fains disability or madness appears in Western art from Hamlet to Russian holy fools, so all audiences will respond to Zatoichi. And sure, the action is sometimes hard to believe, but Takeshi knows this and has injected a level of grim humour into the film.

My only complaint about the film's action is that the final battle between Zatoichi and the bodyguard is anticlimactic. After building up the polarity between them for over an hour, there could have been more to it than a single blow. In addition, the soundtrack strikes me as exceedingly lame until the nice taiko drumming that closes the film.

I cannot comment on SONATINE, as in my market the two films were not released together.",1240099200,,2328,4.700980392156863

1904153,4,B0000A9D4A,"First, I have to mention that this is the first Zatoichi movie I see.  I haven't seen the old ones.  Now to the review.  You have to watch this!!!!! For starters, if you like to see a lot of blood been spill, you love this.  Now, the FX of the blood coming out of wounds are not so good, but who cares? You love gore, you will get gore.  Zatoichi is blind swordsman, read carefully, he is not a samurai in the practical sense.  But he as a amazing warrior.  The movie hints that he is know all across Japan. Now, the fight scenes are amazing, but they last a few seconds (with a lot of blood coming out of the victims by the gallons, and arms been cut off) the longest one is like 40 seconds.  If you know a little about real katanas, and real samurai fights, you should know that those didn't last long, so the movie keep it historically real (the fights, not the story of course).  Ok, the movie.  Those who have read my previews know that I don't tell much.  Zatoichi is like Kenshin from Samurai X in the sense that he is a wanderer.  If he come across an injustice, he tries to put things in order by helping those who can't help themselves.  He arrives at this town, which is been terrorize by 2 rival gangs.  The DP and the Sound guy, created this amazing world, of sound and sight.  The stories move smoothly and engages you totally.  This is one of those movies were you think it ended, and then it continues, and do the same like 3 or 4 times.  And it fools you twice..well, three times.  Is a surprise, so watch it and you'll understand.  The only thing I think people won't like are near the end, were people are having a festival, and they are playing this tecno music and dancing modern dance.  Ok, that is not funny.  A movie from feudal Japan and they are playing and dancing tecno???? What the fu&^%? Then again, it was only after watching the extras that I got it.  Is like a inside joke of the director, so you'll need to see those too. A warning, the big fight...probably will get most people angry...one of the surprises of the movie. Like always, I recommend to rent it before you buy it.  But if you are a samurai fan, then go ahead and make yourself happy.
Now, the bonus, Sonatine.  Is a boring movie.  Not that I'm not use to the Kubrick style (long movie, few almost none dialog).  Is that the movie is pointless.  This guy who is a yakuza, wants to retire. And if you like mafia movies, you know that is a mistake.  The movies moves slow.  The only 2 redeeming quality is that it keeps you expecting more, and when they shoot some in the head they show it all, blood and everything.  And for those breast lovers, there is a scene for you.

To end this.  Zatoichi GREAT!, Sonatine, boring.",1168732800,4,2716,4.233918128654971
1904154,1,B0000A9D4A,"As a fan of samurai films who has watched so many Zatoichi flicks, I can't keep track of which ones I have and haven't seen, I was a bit leery of the thought of a remake.  I mean, more than any other actor/character affiliation in cinema history, Shintaro Katsu IS Zatoichi.  His performances were iconic, nuanced, and always entertaining.  So it's not like getting a new actor to portray James Bond, a franchise I often liken to Zatoichi's series because they both consist of dozens of films that all share similiar elements that vary only slightly from film to film, but still remain extremely watchable and fun in their own right.  But still, I was very curious to see how modern filming techniques would translate to this most beloved of samurai franchises.  Well, you've heard about where curiosity will get you.  This movie is everything Zatoichi should never be.  Katsu's performances were always humorous, skillful, dramatic, and menacing; often all within the same scene.  You loved his character and knew him like a member of your own family.  This new guy has no discernable characteristics that make him likeable or memorable in any way.  The gambling scenes a -cornerstone of any Zatoichi flick- are devoid of any interesting elements whatsoever.  Katsu's Zatoichi would enter the room with a smile and self-deprecating manner and proceed to hustle the place, playing clever tricks and running the show until everyone's money became his and occasionally putting on an intimidating sword demonstration should anybody step out of line.  This guy just quietly sits and bets until he suddenly accuses someone of cheating and promptly cuts every one of the men down.  Nice, Ichi-san, real smooth.  But, how is the action, you ask?  Well, if you like to watch CG swords sever CG limbsand stab into people like butter while highly visceral sound effects try to convince you of it's realism, and CG blood spraying all over you will love this movie.  The skillful performances of swordsmanship you would expect from actors in a samurai movie are almost non-existent; instead you get shots of Ichi's back as he motions towards bad guys and sprays of that ubiquitous computer-generated blood follow.  The humor in this film, rather than being based on Ichi's playful personality and wit like the days of old, consists mostly of cross-dressing jokes and an overweight mentally retarded fellow who runs around town wearing a battle standard and not much else while screaming at the top of his lungs.  Because he's a retard, see?  Hilarious.  And this ""joke"", while slightly amusing the first time you see it, is repeated at least half a dozen times over the course of the movie.  The film runs almost two hours and aimlessly meanders and repeats itself over and over with no almost likeable characters, no meaningful plot, and not even a whole lot of action.  And here's the coup-de-grace: it turns out Zatoichi isn't really blind at all, destroying the entire premise of the legendary blind swordsman for the sake of a nonsensical plot twist.  But, that isn't quite the stupidest thing this film has to offer.  You see, after an hour and fifty minutes of seeing a classic Japanese hero desecrated you, the viewer, are subjected to a lengthy tapdance routine featuring the film's cast.  You read that right:  tapdancing.....in a samurai film.  I kid you not. It goes on for what seems like hours and even has two characters morph into the child versions of themselves (seen previously in flashbacks), and back again as they dance.  Quite possibly the cheesiest thing I've ever seen.  And as one final F.U. to the thoroughly disgusted Zatoichi fans unfortunate enough to view this pile of garbage, the last shot in the film is of Ichi tripping over a rock and falling flat on his face (much like this film, mind you) and declaring: ""Even with my eyes wide open, I can't see a thing"".  Mmmmmm-kay.  So he's a blind swordsman who isn't blind, but pretends to be blind, but he actually cannot see, so he pretends he isn't blind.  Thanks for the headache, jerks.  I think I can hear Shintaro Katsu spinning in his grave, so I'm going to wrap this up;  stay far, far away from this film.",1165622400,10,4181,4.825842696629214
1904155,2,B0000A9D4A,"I am about to finish the original Shintaro Katsu Zatoichi episodes from the 1962 black and white, the 1963 colored version to the 1989 episode.
Takeshi Kitano's Zatoichi just doesn't ""cut"" it. They made it worse by placing a low tech CGI bloodwork effect and having Kitano sport blonde hair instead of white. (dying one's hair blonde is unusual for an aged asian male...unless he plays an unusual character in a Kabuki). Shintaro Katsu was able to give life to Zatoichi through human emotion, love, humor, pain and a sense of destiny. Katsu's Zatoichi was wearing period accurate masseur's clothes or Kimono. On the other hand, Takeshi Kitano just played a blind old man who knows swordfighting. The latter's character was a bit 2 dimensional. It's also hard to tell what period Kitano's character was in. He was wearing modern pants in the movie and not a hakama but the other men in the movie were still wearing traditional gis, hakamas and the women wore kimonos.
It was also weird in the end that he was able to open his eyes seemingly reveal that he was not blind after all and yet his eyes were all black. If he's not blind then he can't be called the blind swordsman right?",1163030400,,1180,4.623809523809523
1904156,5,B0000A9D4A,"I originally caught part of Zatoichi on tv late on night.  After watching 20 min of the movie I was hooked.  I loved everything from the comedic breaks with the gamblers to the beautifully choreographed fight scenes.  It proves the point that sometimes less is really more.  The movie also has a great sense of humor about it self, never taking things so seriously that it becomes terribly ridiculous.  Capping it off with the dance at the end of the movie was just a nice bowtie on the whole package.

As for the second movie sonatine I found it enjoyable, but I'm not sure it translates as well across cultures.  At times if felt like things were being shown that the audience was expected to have an imediate knowledge of, which often left me somewhat mystified.  Still an enjoyable over the top kill fest, with salient moments of introspection.

1904157,1,B0000A9D4A,Takashi Kitano's portrayal of Ichi-san is flat and utterly forgetable.  This movie is a sorry attempt to cash in on the former glory of Shintaro Katsu's Zatoichi.  Kitano is is completely unengaging and fails to elicit any empathy with his character.  Save your money and move on to the older iterations of the adventures of Zatoichi.  They are in a class by themselves and much more entertaining.,1158624000,4,397,4.880597014925373
1904158,5,B0000A9D4A,"I don't know about other reviewers, but I cannot get enough of the Zatoichi episodes starring the late Shintaro Katsu. Even though I have ALL of the Zatoichi motion picture films, and more than half of the television series that Shintaro Katsu acted in during the mid to late 1970s, I was delighted that Takeshi Kitano decided to go ahead with this film. And this despite the fact the Shintaro Katsu died in 1997. Yes, there will only be one Shintaro Katsu, but I believe that this film is a great homage to him. ""The Blind Swordsman:Zatoichi"" is an excellent film. Takeshi Kitano directed, and stars as Zatoichi: Formerly the role of the late Shintaro Katsu. However, the name is where the similarities between these two stars end: other than the fact that both are blind and lethal with a cane sword.

This newer version of Zatoichi played by Takeshi Kitano is not the laughable, and playful masseur that Shintaro Katsu so deftly applied to his own character, but rather a dark and ominous former Yakuza, who hunts down his very own former Yakuza with a swift and exacting vengeance. The plot I found to be extremely well done. And the character development of the actors in the film are wonderfully portrayed. I especially liked the role portrayed by the Ronin (Tadanobu Asano) who will have an eventual showdown with Zatoichi as the film draws to a close. Not to mention the sub plots that surround this particular Zatoichi episode concerning two siblings out to avenge their families deaths.

Now, first of all, do not go into this film expecting the same character that Shintaro Katsu brought to Zatoichi. As I mentioned earlier, there will only be one Zatoichi as far as I am concerned, and that will always be Shintaro Katsu who will be forever immortalized in cinema. However, this too is a great Zatocihi film. Also, for some reason, I could not help but thinking that this is a wonderful end to the Zatoichi films, because for me, this particular Zatoichi film more than measured up. Moreover, on a plus side, this film is further enhanced by the beautiful cinematography and the wonderful soundtrack of the delightful sounds of the of Taiko drums beating in the background. I highly recommend this latest entry of Zatoichi, as it is a fitting tribute to a legendary actor. [Stars: 5+]",1154736000,4,2296,4.7518796992481205

Although ""Zatoichi 2003"" was beautifully shot with lots of choreographed violence and action, the plot centers mostly on what I would have considered marginal characters rather than on what Zatoichi is doing. Zatoichi barely says anything in this film! Furthermore, the ending is absolutely preposterous and insultingly comical, making this mere below mediocre imitation of a flawless original feel even more like a parody than it was. ""Zatoichi 2003"" is to be enjoyed only by those who haven't ever seen the original films and like their movies depthless, shallow, and with lots of meaningless action.",1153094400,,827,5.320610687022901
1904160,5,B0000A9D4A,"This Zatoichi movie is a twist on a long line of Japanese movies about a classic hero, a blind Samuri. Everything gets a bit twisted, from the heros blond hair to the cross dressing geisha. It is every bit as bloody as noted in other reviews, however the fight scenes are wonderfully choreographed and the CG slow motion blood droplets are really actually pretty in a strange way. There are no long drawn out fight scenes,the action is abrupt and certian.

There is a special feature on the making of the movie and Kitano explains some of his ideas for the movie. My absolute favorite scene in this movie has become one of my favorite scenes in any movie, it is the showdown near the end of the movie where Zatoichi faces another skilled Samurai the other Samurai visualizes how he will defeat Zatoichi because the grip Zatoichi is using will allow him to be a fraction of a second faster, after visualizing this he looks up at Zatoichi and smiles. Zatoichi quickly changes his grip, momentarily throwing his opponent off guard, then attacks at once. He of course wins instantly.",1147478400,8,1079,4.649214659685864

Japan is all about illustration, big and colorfull stuff, cool and tough guys, swift swords masters..We have to notice in Japanese cinema that Japan is not a materialist culture and things like justice, fun and friendship means something to them. This movie is very good, not as good as the good old Kurosawa movies may be, but it just makes its point. The music is great by the way, sometimes I found myself dancing with the crowds, it is so good. So enjoy the movie, but see also lighter Chinese movies  too like ""the house of  flying daggers"" and ""Hero"" just to keep it cool. Avoid Tarantino as much as you can,apparently he is loosing it.(Why I recall him, because he recommends Zatoichi, but may be only because it is bloody. After ""the Hostel"" what else could I think?). The original Zatoichi series is lovely too. By the way that was an era of extraordinary gentlemen, just about the same time a Turkish actor, Cuneyt Arkin released a series in which he acted a blind karate master who beats the hell out of criminals.

Kitano, a true modern genius of Japanese film, reinvents one of Japan's most beloved and long-lasting film heroes, the blind, wandering swordsman Zatoichi.  The character was portrayed in 26 films by actor Katsu Shintaro , from 1962-1989.  It was a bold move by Kitano to put his own mark on such a familiar and defined character.

Rather than simply mimic Katsu's work, Kitano completely reinvents the character.  Still a gambler and a wanderer, the humble, self-effacing nature of Zatoichi is retained, but he is less of a comic figure, less of an unlucky but kind-hearted loser.  Kitano's Zatoichi is more calculated, more cunning.  His hair has been died blonde to show the outsider nature of the blind swordsman, forever beyond normal society.  Still blindingly fast with his hidden cane sword, this Zatoichi cuts with an accurate and surgical precision.

The plot is more complex than a normal swordfight flick, with Zatoichi being only one of the prime movers of the story.  Included into the mix are levels of subterfuge from the enemies, with the true boss being protected and hidden, using Zatoichi's own tactics of disguising strengths and presenting a face of weakness.  Into this mix are two sisters seeking their own revenge for the murder of their parents and destruction of their family.

""Sonatine,"" his fourth film,  is an interesting character sketch, laying the grounds for Kitano's later  Yakuza masterpiece ""Hanabi.""  Taking the popular Japanese Yakuza genre, Kitano adds his own sense of humor and pacing to create something unique.

Sent to the distant southern island of Okinawa to end a gang dispute, a band of Tokyo gangsters quickly find themselves in an unclear situation, not knowing the real reason for their exile.  They while their time away, playing games and relaxing on the beach, enjoying their tropical vacation while it lasts.  When it becomes clear that they have been set up, and that some kind of revenge is called for, the light humorous nature of the film takes a sharp turn, and the violent nature of their lifestyle returns.

Unlike what we would consider an action film, ""Sonatine"" is a serious of vignettes, punctuated by sharp, sudden violence.  Rather than exaggerated gun battles and over-the-top schemes, the violence is realistic and quick.  A single bullet is all that is needed to end a life.

On an interesting note, the title of the film comes from a native form of Okinawan folk music, properly called ""sonachine"" that can be heard throughout the film.",1122076800,5,2738,5.017738359201774
1904178,3,B0000A9D4A,"I wanted to love Beat Takeshi's reimagining of the popular Japanese hero Zatoichi.  Unfortunately, I found it to be overpopulated with sketchily drawn characters.  In addition, I could not identify a good reason for some important actions on the part of several characters, which I can't get into without revealing key plot points.  Several reviewers disliked the percussive, almost musical segments, but I found these to be a strength of the film.  I had heard about these segments in reviews and was looking forward to them but even here, although I did enjoy them, I was also disappointed.  I expected and wanted them to be presented as Zatoichi's personal experience of the world; such a unique recognition of patterns and rhythms in everyday life would go a long way toward explaining his prodigious skills and awareness as well as the state of perpetual amusement he seems to be in.  Instead, they were simply presented as musical numbers for the audience to enjoy.  I did enjoy them, but it seemed like a lost opportunity.  Other strong points of this film were the sudden, explosive action scenes and Takeshi's stolid, quirky performance.

The other feature in this package, ""Sonatine,"" is another fascinating misfire.  In this one, Takeshi is a weary gangster who is sent to Okinawa with his men to back up another yakuza faction in a dispute.  Takeshi senses that things are not on the level, and he is right.  Due to certain circumstances, Takeshi and his men end up spending an extended period hiding out in a house on the coast.  Boredom turns to silly playfulness and this enforced isolation turns into an unexpected vacation before the final bloodbath.  This film is very minimalist, as is evidenced by the gunfights.  Participants merely face each other and fire away with impassive faces, yakuza on each side dropping like cardboard cutouts in a shooting gallery.  The final scene is shot mostly from the perspective of the parking lot of a hotel as flashes of light in the windows.  The rest of the film is similarly cold and distant.  An interesting choice, but in the final analysis there was too much distance for me to feel fully involved in the experience.  Still, I feel that this is a film I might profitably rewatch someday.",1121472000,,2250,4.858267716535433

1904180,5,B0000A9D4A,"Kitano's remake of the popular 1960's ""Zatoichi-the Blind Swordsman"" series (there were probably over two dozen of the original series) takes big risks but largely succeeds.  Kitano is a darker, more sinister Zatoichi, and the action is a lot more Tarantino-esque.  The sword action is first class but extremely violent, unlike the original series which, like the vintage Westerns, were mostly bloodless affairs.  Blood squirts everywhere on the scale of ""Kill Bill.""

This is not the 1960s Zatoichi, who was a more light-hearted character who often avoided conflict and was even prepared to play a buffoon to avoid violence.  Not so here - Kitano stalks his prey relentlessly, like the former Yakusa he was.  There is a very adult story spliced in here about the two gisha runaways (one is not who s(he) appears to be) so forget about pre-teens watching this one.  Unlike many Samurai period pieces, there is a plot here which is serious and sad.

The unexpected bonus to this movie is the excellent musical soundtrack consisting of Taiko drumming and dancing, well worth cranking up on a home theater system.  Peasants threshing rice beat out a syncopated background to a scene, and there is a big Taiko musical send up (not too different from some of the 1960s Zatochi musical numbers) at the end.",1116979200,54,1300,4.926605504587156

1904184,2,B0000A9D4A,"I've just spent several months watching the original Zatoichi cinematic series and as a finale, I took a look at this updated version by Takeshi Kitano. Unfortunately I found it a strangely cold and alienating effort.

Many modern movie goers are unaware of the 26 original films from the 60's and 70's, so I assumed this film would reintroduce Zatoichi, giving us some of his background and history. Sadly this was not the case. We are simply dumped into Zatoichi's world knowing nothing of him. Eventually we learn he is a masseur and a gambler and a god-like swordsman, but that's all. Nothing of how he became blind, learned swordplay or ended up a wandering yakuza is presented here. That's a shame, for we learn nothing to really help us identify with him, and he is portrayed in such a distant and cold manner that we never really gain any affection toward the character. His loneliness and loss--his tragic side--are never seen, neither are his doubts and regrets. This leaves our main character a rather inhuman creature, possessed of super human abilities and few discernable endearing qualities.

Structurally this is the old familiar Zatoichi story and all the hallmark themes are here: yakuza (gangsters) bullying farmers and townspeople, Zatoichi out-gamboling the villains, flashy swordplay, fallen samurai taking jobs as yojimbo (bodyguards) for sleazy gang bosses. But when it comes to the main character himself, Zatoichi is treated like a background character. He is silent through 90% of the film; the entire plot is driven by the actions of what should be secondary characters. More often than not, Zatoichi is seen in the background of the scene with his head bowed and his back towards the viewer. When he does come into play it is usually as a killing machine. He displays his amazing sense of smell and hearing, yet he is rarely seen interacting with other characters except when he's chopping them up into digital bits.

Unlike the original films, Zatoichi displays no sense of humor, no scheming intelligence and little humility. He is a distant and unknowable character, like an angel of death, set apart from his world and the viewer alike. Unlike the original films, Zatoichi does not investigate the wrong-doings of the yakuza bosses in town, other characters do that on their own and report it to Zatoichi. And again, unlike the original character, he does not befriend or form emotional ties to the downtrodden in the story, he simply listens to them tell their tale. Ultimately he does take care of their problem, but when he does, it seems to be more a personal matter, not the act of an man righting the wrongs he finds around him.

The special effects in this film are obviously digital, complete with 3-dimensional spouts of the old red-red kroovy, which rarely seem to stain anything, vanishing instead as a mist in the air. Gratuitous violence there is aplenty, often in much greater excess than in the original films--Zatoichi seems more a merciless and unstoppable killer than a man living within the confines of a strict, if harsh, code of ethics.

The score is rather bizarre and distracting, often layering Asian-influenced synthesizer parts overtop traditional shamisen music without regard for whether the two are harmonically related. Natural sounds, such as farmers digging in the fields or carpenters building a house, are turned into the rhythm track for annoying little soundtrack pieces, and not for any apparent reason. It felt like the producers were teetering on the edge of turning this into a musical . . . when suddenly the finale of the film arrives and we're treated to an extended choreographed tap dance scene! Yes, tap dancing in feudal Japan.

In all we end up with a film that is completely blind to what made the original films work so well: their ultimate humanism, which was derived from the stellar performance of Shintaro Katsu, who managed to portray the legendary blind swordsman as a compassionate, charming, empathetic, humble, humorous and highly ethical human being, not the distant and unknowable creature we have here.",1114560000,15,4097,4.99121522693997

1904186,4,B0000A9D4A,"This film is different to me.  It's both a swordfighting flick, but also a film that is meant to work against that type.  There isn't swordfighting in a glamourized affect. It all seems to be slaughter, or calculated fighting and it's far more cerebral and lethal than I've ever seen before.  The blood was a little bit distracting at first, but I think that it would be too disgusting and an annoying impediment in the filmmaking process, so I understand the reaon for these effects.  The one thing that I enjoyed the most was the forsaking of swordfighting in the end to tell the story instead.  What's also interesting is how he tells the story visually instead of with dialogue, particularly in the scene where the siblings are practicing and it compares the footage of when they were young practicing to present and mixing in shots of the sister's reaction.  It says a lot about how she feels for her brother and their predicament.  The thing that's extremely strange is the tap sequence which ends the film, it's just weird, but entertaining in a way.  That's pretty much the entire film, weird but entertaining.  I must also note that it's not really satisfying as an action thriller because the film doesn't really seem interested in that.  I think the reason for this is the director, Takeshi Kitano, wanted to shake up what he thought was a stale formula for the series and so he made it differently and made some strong directorial choices about that.",1112054400,,1462,4.698039215686275

The special effects were of poor quaility, the sword fighting by Zatoichi was mediocre and the story was nothing special.  In addtion, his silly hair color was distracting and he had no personality.  Perhaps the actor was attempting to make the character different from the original, but still, he was not interesting to watch.

1904189,4,B0000A9D4A,"Kitano Takeshi's take on the Zatoichi series is a fine film in it's own right.  However, in the context of the Zatoichi series, I felt that this was a lackluster movie.  Most all the elements of a Zatoichi movie were there, except the most important one of all!

 Now as far as filmmaking goes, I admit that Takeshi is a multi-talented, world class filmmaker.  But Katsu Shintaro not only starred as Zatoichi, but also wrote, directed and produced some of the installments.  He even wrote and sang the theme song!  Katsu Shintaro is synonymous with Zatoichi.  I'm not saying Katsu is a better filmmaker than Takeshi, I just think he's a better Zatoichi movie maker.

 Takeshi does craft a compelling tale, and most of the elements are there .  But let's face it, Zatoichi movies follow an obvious pattern.  He comes across some honest, simple country folk who are beset by corrupt officials/yakuza.  Zatoichi confronts and warns them, having lost face they retaliate against the peasants, which forces Zatoichi into a final showdown.  Of course there's a lot more depth; interwoven sub-plots with characters on both side of the conflict, moral shades of grey.  These movies were always great at showing the dark side of human nature, and of the Japanese Feudal system (where most samurai movies show a romanticized version).  Zatoichi movies always showed the view from the bottom, how peasants were bullied and terrorized by the powers that be.  Kitano did capture the dark, edgy feel of the series.  Kitano should be applauded for not reinventing the wheel, and sticking with a winning formula, instead of succumbing to vanity and reimagining the series in his image.

 So we've got the humble blind masseur with the cane sword who acts as champion for the downtrodden little guy.  We've got arterial sprays, goofy slapstick, witty dialogue, severed limbs... what's missing?  Unfortunately it's the role of Zatoichi and Kitano's portrayal of him.  The role itself was small, and Kitano's performance was grey, limp, and colorless.  You can't not compare this to Katsu Shintaro who played Zatoichi with such a wide range, he was pitiful but praise worthy, gentle to the weak and vicious to bullies, he'd laugh and endure insults towards himself but draw at the drop of a hat other times, he'd crack a goofy fart joke one minute and be beating a guy with his own broken limb the next, he was dirty and ate like a pig but treated others humanely, he played stupid but it was just a way for him to unravel webs of deceit.  I just didn't get this from Takeshi at all, partially because the role wasn't written that way, and also because Kitano delivered a flat performance.  I wanted to like it, but it just wasn't there for me.

 Again Takeshi is a great filmmaker in his own right, this just isn't his milieu.  It's like David Lynch doing James Bond, Jim Jarmusch doing Rocky, or David Cronenberg doing Conan (hmmm that might work!).  But then again Katsu Shintaro had decades to grow into the part, so I'll give Takeshi another chance.

 By the way, I'm sure that some artistic justification for the peroxide blond hair and the tap dance sequence can be fabricated.  But really now, it was completely unnecessary in this context.  Zatoichi movies are much better when they end on a bittersweet note, with plenty of torment and pathos for us to mull over.",1111104000,3,3354,4.785714285714286
1904190,4,B0000A9D4A,"There's something disquieting about Zatoichi - you just don't know how to feel about an invincible swordsman who just happens to be blind.  I love Japanese swordfighting movies so, of course, I've seen some of the old Zatoichi films (no, I haven't seen ALL of them).

The original Zatoichi frequently acted the buffoon; this was partially to put his enemies off-guard and partially because he was just a happy-go-lucky guy.  This new, updated Zatoichi is much more serious; he's leaner - and older.  He also is a supporting player of this movie, staying on the fringes of the story and only intervening when he's needed.  (The plot itself is similar to the movie Yojimbo.)  He doesn't seem to have anything at stake except an abstract sense of Justice.  He still holds his sword in his underhand style, however - it just wouldn't be Zatoichi without it.

On the whole, I think that this is a good update of the film franchise, and I wouldn't mind seeing more of them.  Swordfighting is more realistic in Japanese films - in that things happen with lightning quickness.  The main thing I found annoying in the movie is crude, obvious computer-generated effects.  After sword-strokes, animated blood is added so obviously, it looks as if it were hand-drawn.

It's the retold story of the Blind Swordsman Zatoichi. Who is actally a masseuse, travelling the countryside looking for excietment and a little bloodshed. As with most heroes, trouble usually finds him. Western movies have made a similiar film called (Blind Fury) in the 1980's - starring Rutger Hauer, which I also liked - but nowhere near to the extent of Zatoichi ! Its like an anime come to life! The only disappointing aspect (If you're one to knitpick about the little things like I do), is that there are a few scenes, were the Blood SFX does not seem as realistic as with the rest of the film. But it doesn't really matter. There's something about Takeshi Kitano's film that leave you feeling that there's more to life.

1904192,5,B0000A9D4A,"I've been eagerly awaiting this film since I heard of it being made.  I'm a big fan of the Original Zatoichi films-which were very groundbreaking in their own right. I'm also a huge Beat Takeshi fan-we just don't see enough of this versatile actor in America.

I thought the film was fantastic! The movie in many respects pays homage to the original (especially the fact that they left the time frame in the past, instead of making a movie set in modern day-Bravo!) but, at the same time the film is new, refreshing, and innovative. Set in the past, the realistic costuming and sets alone is worth the price of admission.

One subject I was pleasantly surprised to see tackled was homosexuality, well told in a sad but beautiful sequence that has the child/man geisha dancing. But, on the other end of the spectrum there were many fun to zany parts with the charcter Shinkishi, and, in the movies words, a ""certified idiot"" next door neighbor who thinks he's a Samarai-shown for fun but not in a demeaning way. This movie, unlike early Zatoichi films, is not judgemental, it takes more of a voyeristic view.

Yes, there were a few ""odd"" parts, mainly the end dance sequence-but that's why I LOVE most oriental films-they are totally unpredictable which, IMO, furthers your viewing enjoyment.

The fight scenes were fantastic-violently beautiful, a tad bloody, but nothing in relation to most american films.

Exciting, funny, poignant, slapstick, samarai and vaudeville rolled into one very different film.

Highly recommended 5 stars!",1109116800,3,1535,4.9494163424124515
1904200,5,B0000A9D4A,"For those that don't know Zatoichi is the story of a blind swordsman that spawned many movies and tv shows. One of the most popular samurai series in Japan, this version was not viewed highly in the eyes of many of the original series' fans when it was announced. Even though ""Beat"" Takashi(one of Japan's most respected actor/writer/director/producer/painter/etc.) was at the helm of this project many were very skepitical at best and horrified at most when they heard Zatoichi would be a blonde blue eyed Japanese.

That all changed when it was released. Disbelievers were amazed at what ""Beat"" did with the classic series.

Anyway, storyline goes as so. Zatoichi is a blind massuer who wanders from town to town. He is a likeable person and is taken in by a local woman. Soon he is getting involved with yakuza and is discovered to be a master swordsman, despite his vision impairment. Then as in the original series, he meets and befriends a samurai who he is destined to face in battle. The plot isn't A+ but it is still great. The music and cinematography on the other hand are A+ as is the action. There is a scene in the begining where some angered men who Zatoichi must of pissed off before the movie steal his cane(which conceals his sword) and think they now have the upper hand, but of course they are quickly proven wrong.

Anyway this is a brilliant interpretation of a series that still stands the test of time.

Sonatine is a great movie as well, one of ""Beat's"" first projects, but Zatoichi is the main attraction and is what everyone is showing up for. Sonatine is just the dessert or cherry on top.

Two great movies for the price of one, it is a deal you can't beat. If you don't believe me and the other's that gave this movie such rave reviews atleast do yourself a favor a go and rent this from somewhere. As soon as you're done watching I guarentee you will come back and purchase this. Also a sequel is currently in the works as I write this and will hopefully be released sometime next year in Japan and soon afterwards in America. This is a gem that can't be missed.",1108944000,3,2093,4.497368421052632
1904201,5,B0000A9D4A,"We take it for granted that kung fu movies will include weightless, acrobatic battles, thus distilling the ideals of that martial art and enhancing them for the cinema.  But samurai movies?  They have yet to create a defining visual style.

This movie changes that.

It has a completely original style.  It distills the Samurai essence of the quick strike, the calculated kill.  When Zatoichi draws his sword, the movement blinds you, and computer enhanced blood flies.

Zatoichi is a visual jewel.  It invokes the anime sensibility of creating coolness as an artform, realism be damned, and succeeds brilliantly.

Happily, this does not denigrate the plot.  Many have compared this movie to a Terantino work, and with justice.  However, if I were to compare it to any writer, it would be Wes Anderson.  It is a thoroughly modern affair.  There is no Kurosawa didacticism here.  No one will preach, and the viewer will find no easy moral.  There are only characters who, like real men, have good and evil in their soul in varying degrees.  Men who will do evil to serve good, and do good to serve evil.  There is joy amidst strife, and shameless romanticism beneath the characters' cold and mechanical speech.

I love this movie.",1106092800,,1229,4.855072463768116
1904202,4,B0000A9D4A,"Lets see, I havnt watched the other film (Sonatine) so I won't rate that one yet...This is the first Zatoichi film I've ever seen, but I have seen several of Kurasawa's films. And Im not new to Samurai or martial arts movies

1. the dance scene at the end, I though it was a little strange too at first, not bad, just different.  When looking at some of the directors commentary on the DVD afterward though, he mentioned wanting to update it for the 2000s, so as opposed to a traditional Shinto dance, which would have normally gone there, he added and american style by hiring a japanese tap troup, pretty cool actually I think now.

2.  AS for the CGI blood, it didn't bother me either in ths, as most older samurai fils either had subtle watery-lookinmg blood use, or like in the end of Sanjuro used the ""gushing gyser of blood effect"", so a little CGI seems to me just a new way of doing the same, its not too bad either.

Other then that, I thought the film was very good.  A Kick-A@@ lead (I mean hes blind!) pretty much sums it up.  Obviously this movie is no 7-samurai, but then, its not trying to be.  Anyone who doesnt enjoy this is either knit-picking, or just doesnt like samurai films.  Good for this genre!",1105401600,2,1220,4.3392070484581495
1904203,4,B0000A9D4A,"Director/actor ""Beat"" Takeshi Kitano takes his, er, stab, at the popular Japanese franchise character ""Zatoichi"" with his usual quirky aplomb. With the exception of the iconic ""Seven Samurai"", I don't generally find the genre very compelling; the plot is almost always the same: a village either under siege or at the mercy of a criminal enterprise, a mysterious lone wolf rolls into town, and although reluctant to get involved intitially, becomes moved by the suffering of the salt of the earth villagers, and  singlehandedly dispatches the bad guys...(did I leave anything out?) ""Zatoichi"" is no exception, plot-wise, but Kitano's unique approach makes for great entertainment. The stylized, CGI- enchanced violence, while apparently annoying to some reviewers, was a perfect artistic choice, giving the already cartoonish mayhem an almost beautiful and balletic anime look. I'll also give credit to Kitano for NOT utilizing that ""Crouching Tiger"" flying through the air nonsense that has become a tiresome cliche in Asian action cinema of late. Kitano also makes a bold choice in staging his film like a musical-a construction scene where the carpenter's hammering and sawing informs the rhythm of the accompanying score is right out of ""Seven Brides For Seven Brothers""(!), and of course, the much-discussed dance number at the end. Why is it suddenly so controversial to pepper a violent story with a few dance numbers? Ever heard of ""West Side Story""? Get over it! DVD note: If you can get past Quentin Tarantino's ubiquitous mug trumpeting that he is gracing our collections by ""presenting"" it (did we have a choice?), the 2-disc release also throws in a bonus- Kitano's Yakuza action film ""Sonatine"", previously unavailable on DVD.",1105315200,2,1740,5.281588447653429
1904204,4,B0000A9D4A,"As a long time fan of Japanese Martial Arts flicks and Anime, I found Zatoichi entertaining. The ""filler"" was entertaining. I did not feel the film dragged at all, and it kept me pretty well entertained.  Hardly used the FF button at all. Until the end. What was with the extended village wide Taiko Drums dance fest?  Kodo does a better job - why dedicate the final 15 minutes or so to it? Picture ""Empire Stripes Back"" - the stupid Ewock singing at the end.  Now make it an Ewock dance, drum, singing fest that lasts 15 endless minutes.  Annoying it is.  That's why this got 4 stars and not 5.",1104969600,,595,4.324324324324325
1904205,3,B0000A9D4A,"And that is just what this new version of Zatoichi has, too much filler. The actual story could have been finished in a 40 minute film. Some of the filler was obvious, such as the sequances where the farmers were hoeing the ground to a rythm, were dancing in the field in the rain, were rebuilding the supporting characters burnt down home to a rythm, and that extended dance sequence at the end of the film where most of the surviving cast clog dances on a stage during yet another festival. Not so obvious were unecessarily long walks down the street, a longer than needed gambling sequence, and a sequence where the villians burn down the home of the supporting characters which could have been done in a minute rather than the minute of skulking around the house, another minute of setting fire to it, and yet another minute for the characters to run out after the alarm was raised. Also add to that some flashback scenes with the supporting characters that was not really relevant to the main story.

  The original Zatoichi films started in the early 1960's by actor and producer Shintaro Katsu and remained popular enough for him to make 25 of theme by 1974 [ at one time averaging 4 films a year ]. Moving to television as an hour show, there would be more than 100 episodes of Zatoichi made. [ there was also one final Katsu Ichi film made in 1989 ]. Through all of this, the character was always played by Shintaro Katsu, who died in 1997.

  No one else had ever played Zatoichi, although the character was adapted to other countries.  [The American adaption was the movie ""Blind Fury"" with Rutger Hauer as Nick Parker, the blind Viat Nam vet with the kane sword and was a remake of ""Zatoichi Challenged"" ] The Zatoichi films centered on a blind masseur who at one point in his life lerned to use a sword to protect himself. His hearing gave him near supernatural fighting skills and he was soon working for gangsters as a sword for hire [ his sword hidden inside his kane ] but his good natured heart soon had him killing off the corrupt bosses he worked for to protect the towns people that were being abused. As the films progressed, he would give up the life of a gangster, only hiring himself out on rare occasions. But inevitably the town he would wander into was being taken over by yet another corrupt Yakuza boss who would have to be delt with by the final reel.

  It was a risk for someone else to step into this role, but inevitably, some on would have. Great screen characters never die, but are passed on to new actors when the originator either retires or passes on. Such was the way with Sherlock Holmes, Tarzan, James Bond, Wong Fei-Hung, and a host of other screen characters. But it will always be a risk for the first actor to take over the role. No one wants to be the next George Lazenby. It usualy is not until the third actor takes over the role that audiences are willing to accept, while still agreeing that the first was the best.

  So why if you are going to take such a risk, would you make such a film? The thin plot is derivative of all the other Zatoichi films. A once happy village is taken over by a corrupt Yakuza gang that demands way too much protection money from the shop owners. Zatoichi does not want to get involved but winds up at the local gambling hall where he exposes them as cheaters, resulting in the death of all the Yakuza running the place. The head boss realizez that the blind man must be the famouse Zatoichi and resolves to have him killed before Ichi comes for him. There is the obligatory ronin with superior swordsmanship  hired by the boss who decides that he will be the one who will finally kill Zatoichi, and the final scene where Ichi finally decides to go to the head bosses house and take out him and his army of henchmen. There is also a subplot thrown in where a cross dressing brother and sister are looking for the gang of ninja theves who killed their parents, but even this was not enough to pad out the film to feature legnth. While this plot was typical of the original Zatoichi films, they were at least written with enough characters who's subplots interconnected with the main plot to warrent a 90 minute film. There was just not enough plot for this film and it showed.",1104537600,7,4259,4.422733077905492
1904206,5,B0000A9D4A,"To the frustrated film critic wannabe who reviewed and critiqued Kitano's acting, Kitano does pretty damn well for a man who's face was 1/2 paralyzed in a motorcycle accident years ago. As a director, he has a unique vision - something the reviewer lacks.  As for Katsu, having done in excess of 20 Zatoichi films (and LITTLE else), one would expect a well developed character. The writer might be interested to know Katsu was a serious alcoholic, abusive to his casts, crews and family and not a pleasant guy. He was a great actor and a good film maker but not in Takeshi Kitano's (or Takeshi Beat's ) league.

For those of you who like samurai (Chambara), you will be thrilled. For those of you new to Zatoichi, you are in for a treat! (If you like it, you have  Katsu's films to see!).

For all... the last 5 minutes are pure genious and ground breaking from a Japanese point of view and will surprise the hell out of you.

You will enjoy this film.",1104451200,7,952,4.417142857142857

I'm not going to get into story except to say that this film was really entertaining and hilghy enjoyable.  My only gripe is this film screams CGI, almost all the kills are cgi, well the bloodatleast it's just sooooo ....CGI!!!

Other then that this was a pretty cool, slick film by Kitano himself.  I must say he's on a role with some of his films, though this isn't his best work it's still worth a watch.

Overall it this film has cool action, some funny moments and some not so funny moments, it has great action though it screams CGI all over the place it still won't stop you from enjoying it and that is why I give this film a

1904208,5,B0000A9D4A,"I have never seen the series that this movie is based on. And I must say I'm grateful for that since it seems from the reviews posted here that few who are familiar with the series seem to be able to enjoy this movie.  That is a shame and I hope it doesn't work the same in the other direction since I intend to look up the series and view it too.

I thought the movie's mix of high drama, low comedy, poignant heartbreak, hyperviolent action and creative anachronism was well-nigh perfect.  I was never bored, not for a second.  And I was continually suprised by the creativity and freshness of the storytelling even as it treaded through well-worn cliches.

I am now a little afraid to watch the second feature, Sonatine, or anything else the director, Kitano, has done.  I fear it won't be as good as this and it couldn't possibly be better.",1103673600,6,844,4.412903225806452

1904210,5,B0000A9D4A,"Speaking of the final matsuri dance scenes in this film, instead of either reviling them (negative reviews) or trying to minimally justify and excuse them (positive reviews), reviewers here might want to consider that these are actually the heart, soul, and high-point of the film.

These dance scenes ALONE are worth the price of this DVD! They are showing the mindless rhythmic energy of life that remains no matter who wins or loses. These scenes are a raw and gorgeous display of the animal energy which forms the root of samsara.

In fact though I liked the entire movie quite a lot (especially Z'chi himself and his middle-aged girlfriend, the reason I've actually bought the DVD is simply to have the final matsuri dance scenes.

1904211,3,B0000A9D4A,"I would like to point out the positives first. First the action sequences are well done. The moves were quick and decisive and I wasn't disturbed about the fake splashes of blood. The storyline is actually quite interesting as you find him coming into town to battle some gangsters. The actors did an alright job in comparison with what they had to work with.

However, the quality of the film does not seem up to par though it was released in 2003 or 2204. You don't really connect strongly with any of the characters including the blind swordsman. The last tap dance sequence was really unecessary and seemed out of place. It looks like they cut a scene from a completely different movie and just pasted it in there. One poster said one scene doesn't take away form the quality of the film but it does. One scene can ruin a movie - Notice the poster didn't state the scene wasn't bad or didn't belong there.

This movie is not as bad as some people are saying but truthfully it's not as good as some people are saying. It is an ok movie. It had good potential and didn't live up to it.",1102809600,5,1087,4.349753694581281

Bubba Hotep was one of the most original and best acted 'B Movies' that has ever been produced! The screenplay was funny and surprisingly endearing. Bruce Campbell's finest performance.

I don't know if the direction is at fault or if Beat Takeshi was allowed to do his own interpretation of Zatoichi but Zatoichi is practically nonexistent throughout the movie other than the odd killing scene or being seen sitting somewhere with his head down not talking.

The original zatoichi was vibrant and clever .This one is totally aloof to comatose.

I'm very disappointed to have spent 27 dollars on it.

The secondary characters' stories were pretty good but whenever zatoichi appeared the story ground to a halt.

I kept waiting for one of the other characters to kick him or something to see if he was awake.

1904215,5,B0000A9D4A,This is a modern Japanese rendition of the famous Zatoichi movies and series of 1962 and up.  When you think of Samurai movies - you must not leave this one out.  Zatoichi - the common man's Samurai - famous and beloved by generations of Japanese - has come to the big screen in a big way.  Zatoichi is a highly moral and skilled swordsman who travels about olden days Japan.  Two things set him apart from other Samuari movie characters - he uses the unorthadox upside down grip on his cane sword and he is blind.  This doesn't stop him from defeating scores of his enemy.  This movie is very well done and the acting and sword play is excellent.  The lead actor was actually a comedian in Japan but who is obviously very skilled with the sword.  His portrayal of Zatoichi is supurb.  The underlying theme of all Zatoichi films is one of morals.  Good over evil.  There is humor intermixed with drama and the everflashing cane sword of justice.  If you are at all familiar with the Japanese Samurai films of old - you must have this for your collection.,1102291200,6,1054,4.432291666666667
1904216,4,B0000A9D4A,"Let me start off by saying that I'm a big Beat Takeshi fan.  I like Japanese cinema in general, and I think that Beat is at the forefront of both acting and directing in the current era.  I was very excited to see his take on Zatoichi.  What I wasn't expecting was an extra DVD in the case that I didn't even know I had also rented.  I decided to watch Zatoichi first, obviously, and I couldn't help but be just a bit disapointed.  I don't think that it was nearly as bad as some of the other reviewers here seem to think.  Rather, I think that it's a matter of taste.  I prefer something a little more period accurate in my samurai films.  Some films, such as Twilight Samurai, show us how much room for exploration there is in samurai culture.  I also thought that the style of this film was perhaps too modern.  That being said, there is still a lot to like.  I enjoyed the fighting scenes, which were very fluid, dynamic and at times explosively powerful (despite the conspicuously poor CG elements.)  Some of the characters were quite interesting, and there was actually more plot than I expect out of an action film, even a Japanese one.  The disapointment on my part was due more to the fact that it simply wasn't what I expected out of it, which is hardly the fault of Takeshi, unless you blame him for the way that the trailer was cut.  The real surprise for me came when I watched Sonatine the next day.  This film made me think less of Zatoichi simply because it was so amazingly good.  Takeshi's performance is excellent on all fronts, and the plot is fresh and just different enough to be very compelling without being inaccesible.  Simply: this film is worth the price that you pay for the set, and if you also get Zatoichi with it then that is just a bonus.  You can use it for a slick drink coaster, or perhaps a dog toy, or you can hang it from your car mirror to let people know how 733T you are.  Maybe I'm being too harsh.  But I do think that most people will enjoy Sonatine more than Zatoichi; I know I certainly did.  Oh, and you have to watch the intro and outtro with Quentin Tarentino on Sonatine, just to hear him repeatedly mis-pronounce ""Takeshi"" and sound like an absolute no talent hack, it's worth a laugh or two.",1102291200,,2245,4.310262529832936
1904217,2,B0000A9D4A,"I don't know where to begin talking about this movie. I guess first I'll say there are two films in this package dvd case one is Zatoichi and a bonus film named Sonatine. First I'll talk about Zatoichi, the visual effects in Zatoichi could have been better. I will say that I have never really seen a movie that actually shows (in like two scenes) the sword cutting the body in the manner that this film does. I like the realism of the movie seeing as much of the fights are not drawn out with flashy swordplay. Most fights are quick and deadly. The director tried to show his humor but it was dry and just not funny. Special effects were used to replace the old blood ""hose-spray"" technique. The blood looks nice in a comic book kind of way but you will definately not be wondering if it is real blood or cg, you will know its cg. The plot of the movie is average, there is nothing really amazing about it that you have not seen before if you have watched lots of movies. What really ruined this movie for me was at the end there was a lonnng scene where these people were dancing at a festival or something..they were doing somekind of tapdance, geisha dance hybrid ..it was so horrible. What made it so bad is that this was going on as the final battle/plot revelation was taking place in anoter location and characters from the main plot were jumping up on stange and also tap dancing,, I mean what the heck is that!! The director kept cutting from people tapdancing to zatoichi fighting these ninja looking guys, that was just bad directing in my opinion. The extras contain a ""making of"" and interviews with costume designers, weapons instructors etc. The bonus material is not really that interesting. If you like japanese sword fighting or samurai you might wanna check this out. The movie was not totally horrible but it wasn't good either.

Now Sonatine on the other hand was complete garbage, this movie was one of the worst i've ever seen, right up there with ""Bubba Hotep"". Every one in this movie looks tired and depressed like they were forced to be there. Its supposed to be a gangster movie, and also its like 11 years old. This movie begins slow and boring and by the time it is over you won't know and won't care what happened. About 20 minutes into the movie there is a shoot out scene and all involved just stand up and shoot at each other without any emotion, it was so dull. After that scene there is about 45 minutes where the group of Yakuza gangsters go to a house on the beach and play every stupid game you can imagine (frizby etc.) its so bad its funny. To make it even worse they got Quinten Tarintino in the special features talking about how its the most amazing movie ever made, obviously to attract his brain-dead followers. What a moron.

1904219,5,B0000A9D4A,"These two movies represent the cream of the crop in recent Japanese filmmaking, and both represent Takeshi's bizarre ultra-violent yet comical worldview. Takeshi directs and plays the lead role in both films. It's really quite amazing how much talent the man displays (he also edits the films). Definitely world-class cinema.

Zatoichi is a remake of one of the most popular Japanese serials of all time. Takeshi plays Zatoichi, a blind masseur and part-time yakuza (gambling lowlife). Zatoichi slices and dices his foes with a concealed sword within his walking cane. Incredible photography and creative use of Stomp-like rhythm routines. Apocalyptically bloody, with masterful battle scenes, Zatoichi will nonetheless make most film fans smile.

Sonatine is similarly fun. Taheshi is a mid-level yakusa boss who finds himself sent down to the southern island of Okinawa. Grumblingly he plays along, but when he arrives he realizes he has nothing to do. So he and his yakuza buddies clown around on the beach until they realize the whole trip may have been a set up. This one's a bit older than Zatoichi, but it's no less brilliant. It's kind of like a combination between Takeshi's film Kikujiro (where a yakuza is stuck taking care of a young boy) and John Woo's The Killer. Sonatine also comes with some amusing musings from Quentin Tarantino.

Fully recommended, and a steal at this price.

1904230,5,B0000A9D4A,"This is the type of Beat Takeshi film I have been yearning to see for a decade.  It is a Japanese period film stylistically similiar to Kurosawa's Yojimbo and Sanjuro.  Takeshi however has modernized the genre with the utmost taste and care.  The music, the acting, the swordfights, the tap dances, the camerawork, the plot, the computerwork... all utterly amazing.  Takeshi set out to make a ""Big Screen"" work to entertain the masses and he has far surpassed any expectations.

I cannot believe this hasn't exploded onto the big screen in America.  This movie can be enjoyed on a number of different levels by an extremely wide audience.

If you haven't seen this movie go out and rent it, you will not be disappointed.

1904231,4,B0000A9D4A,"ok, to be honest, i have not yet watched Zatoichi. i'm not here to review that. judging by the reviews of the others on here, you can see that you either love it or hate it. i'm here to recommend SONATINE.

people seem to overlook Sonatine. to be honest, that was the reason i bought this DVD. Sonatine was previously not available on DVD, and you could only get it in a full screen VHS. now it's here in all it's glory. don't expect a crazy action movie like Zatoichi, Sonatine is more akin to Hana-Bi (aka Fireworks). very slow paced, but still very good. this double feature is worth it just for Sonatine.",1100476800,13,608,4.333333333333333
1904232,2,B0000A9D4A,"Having seen most of the original Zatoichi films on IFC and becoming hopelessly hooked on them, I was extremely excited when I heard that the series was being brought back for a new generation of fans.  Now that I've finally seen the new Zatoichi film, I'm sad to say that I'm extremely disappointed.

The Plot: the plot is basically the same generic formula that already forms the basis of at least a dozen prior Zatoichi films.  If you're new to the series, this isn't necessarily a bad thing.  But for me, it felt like I had seen all of this before, just now it wasn't as good.  The characters (with a few exceptions) were not fully developed.  The villians didn't stand out.  You could predict the ending from a mile away.  You would think that if the goal was to revive the series for a new generation, the filmakers would have wanted a story that truly stood out.  Plotwise, there is nothing new here.

""Beat"" Takeshi's Performance:  What performace?  His acting in this movie is basically the same as his acting in all his movies.  He just sort of sits there with a blank expression on his face.  God, this guy's overrated.  Let's face it, even if ""Beat"" had given a semi convincing performance, it still would not have worked.  What makes a Zatoichi film work is the late great Shintaro Katsu.  He was such a great actor, and he always made Zatoichi come alive.  Zatoichi films all stick to a basic formula.  But with Shintaro Katsu, it didn't matter, because his performance always made the experience unique.  A Zatoichi film without Mr. Katsu is like a Dirty Harry film without Clint Eastwood.  I just doesn't work.  But, Mr. Takeshi,  if you still insist on making it anyway, hire a leading actor who can actually act (not yourself).

The Swordfights:  They were pretty good, but there were not enough of them to keep me interested.  I liked the addition of gore, but if I want to watch a samurai film for arterial sprays, I'll watch a ""Lone Wolf and Cub"" movie.

Other gripes:  What's with the blond hair?  It was just plain stupid, and made no sense.  Heat Mr. ""Beat"", don't try to be different just to be different.  Make sure that you have an actual POINT to make while you're at it.  And what's up with the extended dance sequence at the end??? Was I supposed to enjoy that or something?

The Other Disc: I tried to watch ""Sonatine"", but after about an hour, I ejected the disc out of sheer boredom and frustration.  Once again we have the pleasure of watching ""Beat"" give the same performace he always gives: just sort of sitting there with either a blank or an eat-s*** look on his face.  Hey Beat, buy a clue.  That's not acting.  We're impressed when an actor is able to demonstate a little RANGE.

So, to summarize, Beat Takeshi is highly overrated as an actor and is a semi-talented director.  His Yakuza films are all the same, and his Zatoichi film is no different than any other Zatoichio film, except it has none of the charm of the originals.  Stick with the Katsu films.",1100476800,12,2998,4.51024208566108
1904233,4,B0000A9D4A,"Takeshi Kitano's cinematic style answers to nobody.  You either accept it or you don't, and if you're going to derive enjoyment out of his films, you have to understand and accept his quirky approach towards narrative -- such as never signalling a flashback, never introducing characters by name, and lurching expositions.

I had expected that his remake of Zatoichi would become the most accessible of his films, but despite the samurai-film milieu, Kitano's style remains as difficult to grasp as ever.  And the middle of the film lags quite a bit, when the back story of the two geishas and the gambling nephew's subplot take over and Zatoichi disappears for 20, 30 minutes straight.

But I'd seen enough Kitano films to be prepared for this.  And the reward lies in stunning action choreography, beautiful cinematography, a terrific acting turn from Kitano himself, and some of the best sight gags in the Kitano catalogue.  Comedy has always been the backbone of his films, and in Zatoichi he crafts some of his funniest situations and characters.  Kitano himself is perfect for this role, with his immense physical presence, yet he constantly expresses that little odd sliver of tenderness and humour that has always made his characters so watchable.

What truly amazes are the action scenes.  Characters move with grace and power, and the sound effects are realistic and pack a wallop -- no comic-book whooshes and noises here.  Fight choreographer Tatsumi Nikamoto, in a short interview on this DVD, hits the nail on the head:  Kitano uses his entire body to drive blows and directs his actors to do the same, making for kinetic swordplay scenes that rank with some of the best martial-arts scenes ever filmed.  The choreography, shooting and editing here are leagues above Kill Bill Vol. 1's blood-spraying, overly edited scenes and won't even pale alongside some of Lau Chia-liang and Tang Chia's best work with Chang Cheh.

There are traces of Kurosawa's Yojimbo and Sanjuro in this film, in terms of the dark humour, the warring gangs, and the one-swift-blow approach towards duelling rather than clashing, extended swordfights, and watching Zatoichi cut a swath through the hordes, you might think Toshiro Mifune were still alive -- and that's a mighty feat.

The long period of waiting for plot progressions in the middle does cut into the enjoyment, and overall the pacing of this film is less accessible than Brother, but the best parts of Zatoichi are thrilling beyond words.  A must-watch, though newcomers to Kitano are advised to check out Brother first.

One more word about this DVD:  The strange cover and the ""double bill"" moniker may suggest this is a pirated copy, like one of those ""10 Jackie Chan movies on one disc"" releases by no-name companies, but looking at the disc, I think it's authentic.  Miramax simply made a weird choice by including Sonatine in the package and making the package look inexplicably like those pulpier releases.  Why Sonatine?  I have no idea, since it has nothing to do with Zatoichi, despite being a pretty good film in itself.  But the picture transfer on both films is good, the supplemental materials well put together, and everything suggests that this disc is indeed an official release.  So don't be fooled by the packaging.",1100217600,6,3287,4.981684981684982
1904234,3,B0000A9D4A,"""The Blind Swordsman"" is the latest film to feature Japanese cinematic hero and martial arts master Zatoichi, a character who was created in 1962 and has since been the subject of 26 films and a Japanese television series. Zatoichi (Takeshi Kitano) is a blind itinerant masseur and gambler living in 19th century Japan. He comes upon a farming village that is being terrorized by the Ginzo gang, a band of extortionists out to control the town's businesses. Zatoichi's blindness and unassuming nature disguise his expert swordsmanship and intuitive powers, as he sets out to liberate the town and aid two Geisha, O-Kinu (Yuuko Daike) and O-Sei (Daigoro Tachibana), who seek to avenge the slaughter of their family 10 years before.

Director Takeshi Kitano takes on the role of Zatoichi himself. The story is told in the style of a fable. ""The Blind Swordsman"" has no three-dimensional characters. It has only roles. The victims are not sympathetic. Nor is Zatoichi. The one character whom  the audience might care for is the ronin Hattori Genosuke (Tadanobu Asano), who becomes the gangster Ginzo's bodyguard in order to support his ailing wife. But Hattori is a peripheral character. In fact, everything in the film seems peripheral. Peripheral to what, I couldn't say. To augment the ""old tale"" atmosphere, the film stock was treated with silver in post-production. This softens the colors while imparting a metallic quality. The result is that ""The Blind Swordsman"" looks like faded Technicolor, which I found unattractive. There are bloody sword fights, of course. But they consist mostly of unanswered lethal cuts and are quite dull. And the bloodletting looks horribly fake, recalling the poor special effects of the 1950s. A gambling addict with a good heart, Shinkichi (Gadarukanaru Taka), provides ""The Blind Swordsman"" with comic relief. He is genuinely funny, but that was not enough to keep me interested in a slow film with no real characters or purpose. Japanese with English subtitles.

The DVD: Bonus features include a making-of documentary and interviews with 4 members of the production staff. The ""Behind-The-Scenes Special"" is an unnecessarily long (40 minutes) documentary that takes us through the film's 5-week shoot and includes interviews with the director and cast. It offers endless effusive praise of director Takeshi Kitano to points beyond annoying. There are Video Interviews with: Cinematographer Katsumi Yanagishima (4 1/2 minutes), Production Designer Norihiro Isoda (5 1/2 minutes), Costume Supervisor Kazuko Kurosawa (7 minutes), and Master Swordsman Tatsumi Nikamoto (4 1/2 minutes). Subtitles are available in English, English for the hearing impaired, Spanish, and French. Dubbing is available in English.",1100044800,3,2745,5.379069767441861
1904235,2,B0000A9D4A,"Let's face it, Takeshi Kitano is well past his prime when it comes to film making (and acting for that matter.) The latest installment in the Zatoichi series is a bit of a disappointment considering the amount of hype surrounding it. I first heard about it on NPR by some guest movie critic ranting and raving about it like it was the greatest artistic film achievement to come about in the past 10 years. Maybe that should have been my first warning.

What is supposed to be some sort of art house stand out is basically just a well funded main stream flick from Japan. The movie is filled to the brim with horrible CGI effects when sword play comes into the picture. A majority of the characters in the film seem pretty one dimensional. The only one who didn't feel like it was the Aunt but she basically gets pushed to the side after the first 15 minutes. The twist at the ending of this film fealt like something out of a bad hollywood suspense film starring Ahsley Judd. Too much hype for something that isn't there.

Takeshi Kitano's sagging creativity is the last thing the Zatoichi series needs to ""re-energinize"" it. This just feels like the final nail in the coffin for this series. Sadly there will probably be another sequel by Kitano though.

1904236,5,B0000A9D4A,"This film was very well made. And I think one of the key aspects that made this film so great was the artistic blending of different elements. The pacing of the story is very nice. the blend of character developement and action is beautiful, as well as the blending of CGI into the action sequences. It's so smooth and elegant that it feels natural. Unlike many films which rely or over use this medium until it become an eyesore. I'm not really a fan of excessive blood or gore, but this film uses the blood and gore elements to where they are actually beautiful. I know that might sound strange, but this film, like kill bill, manages the diffucult task of creating art out of carnage. The music creation scenario's where a welcome suprise, although I have to say that while I found the end one intrestion I thought it was out of place and drew me away from the dramatic ending. I can understand some of the classic film fans being upset by some of the liberties Takeshi Kitano took with the story and character, but I personally feel that judged on it's own merit this film is well worth checking out. This is going in my collection once it's released. Plus I'm curious about the extra film included, which could turn out to be a nice bonus.",1098576000,7,1244,4.436681222707423
1904237,5,B0000A9D4A,"Takeshi Kitano's take on the legendary blind swordsman is a bento box full of surprises.  From the electric blonde hair of the title character to the anachronistic yet humorous one-liners to the show-stopping dance number at the end, one is hardpressed to find a more offbeat and entertaining samurai movie. We start off with Zatoichi, travelling as a blind masseuse from town to town. In one particular stop, he gets to defend a lady vegetable vendor from extortionists, teach her ne'er do well nephew some gambling tricks, almost become a victim of two vengeful geishas, a truncated showdown with a ronin and ultimately, finding out who the real big boss of the gang that terrorizes the town. The main story is rich with subplots involving the other characters. The most interesting of which are that of the two geishas. The ronin Hattori's (Tadanabu Asano) tale is also tragic and even though the acting is understated, bordering on stoic, you can still emphatize with his dilemma. The pace is rather languid but never boring as it is peppered by suberb, if not brutal, fight scenes (anime style blood fountains are prevalent - seen also in Kill Bill), lines as sharp as a kitana and unpredictable scenes like a Dancer In A Dark-esque rice paddy musical and of course, the tapdancing finale. A definite must-see.",1098144000,5,1315,4.896860986547085
1904238,5,B0000A9D4A,"I just watched this movie at a local filmfest. Excellent. Very entertaining. There are moments you are stiff in your seat anticapating what is coming next... and you know what is coming... but there you are at the edge of your seat anyway. There were moments when the entire audience broke out in laughter! A mysterious Masseuse. A Ronin. A murdering pair of Giesha. And none of them are (only) what they seem to be. And each has a story. It deserves a few more viewings. (There is some gore, not gratiutous, but its there.)",1095984000,6,524,4.526315789473684
1904239,5,B0000A9D4A,"I've been waiting for something like this to come along for a long time.  Finally, a movie with cool swordfights and special effects to go along with it's great story and acting.  A brief paraphrase of the story is a blind swordsman(Zatoichi) comes across a town which is run by cutthroat gangs and a master ronin.  As he makes his living by giving massages and gambling, he ends up involved with two geishas who are trying to avenge the murder of their parents by one of the rival gangs.  And let the blood fly!

Loaded with lightening fast swordplay that is 100% free of wire tricks and with special effects nearly equal to that of any hollywood movie, the action is flawless.  The blood flies off the screen and nearly hits you in the face.  The skill of Zatoichi is amazing.  He is truly a master of the sword.  His blazing fast strokes strike down his opponents before they even see him draw his weapon.  There is plenty violence and gore almost equal to that of Kill Bill aside from the over the top blood fountains.  In this movie the blood flow is much more realistic and there is more fighting overall.  The movie does slow down a couple of times in terms of killing but just to add to the depth of the story, then it is right back off with his head.

Another area where the movie shines is the awesome sound quality and the way it's used to be able to hear as well as Zatoichi himself.  With a good surround sound system it will be like you are right there among all the slicing and dicing.  The audio is in japanese with optional subtitles(which I recommend)and in english.  The subtitles are done very well and the dialogue is usually short so there is no extensive reading.  There is also english dubbed audio that is not the greatest.  Some of the voices are done in an extremely stereotypical way: ""Would you rike some more sake?"" (Would you like..."")  It really makes the acting cheesy.  The added bonus to all of this is the acting(if you watch it in japanese).  I am not talking Oscar performances but for what each role requires the actor performs perfectly.  There is also some really good humor in the film coupled with some clever musical scenes, except for the ending riverdance/stomp broadway type dance session.  What in the world was that all about?  Just try to ignore it and think of all the glorious bloodshed you just witnessed.

This movie has it all and is instantly one of my favorites.  Everyone who is a fan of action, swordfighting, martial arts, or just good ol' hack and slash is sure to love this one.  A must see and own!",1095552000,14,2561,4.439914163090129

The movie is not all action because its got a story to tell of course. Zatoichi just has that kool factor. The fights seens aren't all crazy with all that wire work n stuff, they look more realistic. It uses CG (computer generated) effects to help its realism with the blood, swords being thrown into a person and appendages making it awesome! Kool japanese movie. No corny fighting in this one, its jus kool. Its got to be good, the director is in the movie! This is now one of my favorite movies.",1095465600,4,636,4.578947368421052

Here is how I would describe it: It's like Kurosawa's Yojimbo, but with a blind guy, two geishas (who have their own little quirks), a bunch of small musical sessions which seem to be like Riverdance, Stomp!, and Kodo drums all put together, and blood spurts almost equal to that of Kill Bill.",1094947200,4,464,4.284090909090909

Takeshi takes a well known character and without changing the feel of the character, he gives him a vivid personality that comes out well on the screen.  I got the chance to see this film in a pre-screening and I enjoyed it thoroughly.  The only part that I found to be strange was at the very end when the townspeople did a modern dance, but I understand this was artistic license.  I hope this brings a revival into the character and we will see many more in the future.",1094169600,6,547,4.281553398058253
1904254,5,B0000A9D4A,"I can't pretend that I am familiar with the Japanese series ""Zatoichi: the Blind Swordsman"" that this film is based on. I didn't hear that there was a series that this movie comes from. I decided to see it today. Normally I am not into graphic violence and gore like this movie is filled with but I managed to not let it bother me. I found myself enjoying the film. I especially liked how some of the characters in the film didn't appear to be what they appeared to be. The premise of this film surrounds a blind masseur who wanders from town to town. He comes across a small town where it is run by a bunch of nasty criminals who extort money from the townsfolk. The story becomes more interesting when he runs into two geishas who are bent on avenging their parents' deaths. My favorite moments is when the geishas are practicing in Aunt Oume's house. As Osei is playing the Japanese instrument, I got a glimpse into the past to see what led the brother and sister to wander from town to town stealing money from men. I also loved how the sounds in the movie had a rhythmic feel that coincide with the film score, like the workers in the rice field when they were hoeing the land. The sounds of their hoes clanking against the ground had a rhythmic beat that you could snap your fingers too. Same with the scene when those same people were stomping in the mud. Another sub-plot of the movie is an unemployed samurai looking for work. He is traveling from town to town with his wife who is ill. She does not approve it when he takes a job with a local ganster as a bodyguard. He is the only samurai in the film whose skills comes close to Zatoichi's. The final scene between him and Zatoichi was shortert than expected. I was hoping for a long, drawn out battle but other than that their confrontation was interesting to say the very least. The more humorous moments came when Aunt Oume's nephew tried on some geisha make up. He made for one ugly woman. Then there was the neighbor's son who is referred to the town idiot, who goes around running around dressed up as supposedly as a samurai. I loved it when he gets hit in the head by a piece of wood by Zatoichi who was annoyed by his presence when he was chopping wood for Aunt Oume. The costumes and scenery was spectacular. I especially loved the kimonos on the geishas. I loved the twists and turns in this movie. As gory as it is, I was entertained.",1093737600,5,2407,4.315673289183223
1904255,5,B0000A9D4A,"Takeshi Kitano breathes life back into the samurai film genre with this masterpiece.  Kitano plays the role of the unassuming blind masseur, Ichi.  Ichi has a secret though.  Despite being blind, he is a master swordsman.  He has a blade concealed within his cane, and he uses his uncanny sense of hearing to guide him in his battles.  The way he slices through his foes and then just shrugs it off with a laugh is pure cool.  In this movie, Ichi enters a town in which several gangs are battling for power.  One gang eventually gains the upper hand and makes life a living hell for the townsfolk.  Ichi makes a few connections with the townsfolk, and uncovers a network of crime and corruption.  Once equiped with this information, he sets out to deal justice with a quick flash of his sword.

Kitano does a great job on this remake.  This Zatoichi stands apart from the original.  Both Zatoichis can be appreciated as masterpieces of Japanese cinema, and they act as mirrors of the times in which they were produced.  One scene that sets Kitano's Zatoichi apart is the final scene.  After the main plot has been resolved, the villagers celebrate with a festival.  Kitano opts for something new by featuring tap dancers at the festival.  It seems a little strange to hear it, but believe me, it works.  This seemless blend of the modern with the timeless is what really breathes life into the samurai genre.  Another Kitano masterpiece.  Check it out.",1093564800,11,1452,4.66798418972332

The film is worth seing if you are a fan of the series, it has all the elements of a Zatoichi, but lacks the intense drama that acompanies the older films. Seeing Kitano as Zatoichi instead Katsu was just to weird. I also think the twist he decides to put in at the end is just to way over the top and I don't see why he thinks he can just change around a story that isn't even his. I gave this two stars.",1093219200,4,523,3.897196261682243
1904257,1,B0000A9D4A,"Having been a big fan of the original Zatoichi movies and TV series with Shintaro Katsu I wondered why anyone would want to make an ""updated"" Zatoichi film since they are colossal and not likely to be topped in any manner, shape, or form. And I wondered as well how anyone would do this even if it were possible. There are some things that should be left alone having reached perfection the first time around. Zatoichi is one of these things. No one can or ever will be able to do for the Zatoichi role what Shintaro Katsu has done. He is the heart and soul of The Blind Swordsman and always will be. But me being the fan I am and having seen several good reviews of the Kitano movie, I went to see it today.
It was so god-awful bad that I felt ashamed for Takeshi Kitano and knew that if I were him I would most certainly commit hari-kiri for having made such a horrific mess of a movie that didn't even really try to be bad caricature of the original but was content to be an apathetic caricature. The Zatoichi in this film isn't even really blind! Even the so called comedic relief scenes were unfunny walk throughs which proported to be funny but were so poorly done as to be embarassing. Kitano was an uninspired Zatoichi without personality, kindness, humor, remorse, compassion or any of the things that made us love the original Zatoichi done by Shintaro Katsu. Kitano mumbled through the entire performance and the swordplay scenes were poorly done, too short, poorly filmed and not at all exciting compared to any of the movies done by Katsu. I did hear some people in the audience laugh a bit but I'm sure it was because they just didn't know any better. The other actors turned in similar performances to Kitano's which were unconvincing and lacking in intensity. It was as if Kitano tried to patch together his movie with the elements of the original but without the organic wholeness and inexplicable magic that made the originals so great. The long dancing scene by the cast at the end was catchy but totally out of place. This movie is a blot on the Zatoichi name and it hurts me to think that it might be remembered by association as representitive of Katsu's earlier work by future generations. Save your money and buy the movies made by Shintaro Katsu which are just now starting to come out in numbers as DVDs. Only then will you see what the big deal is about. I am shocked and amazed that anyone would write a good review of this turd of a movie. It must be as I said that they just didn't know any better. BUT I DO!! Hey Takeshi! WHAT WERE YOU THINKING MAN??
  A year has passed since I wrote this review and I just wanted to put another nail in this coffin since I noticed that some people are writing good reviews for this film and even going so far as to ""dis"" reviewers who didn't like it calling them ""wannabe"" reviewers. Are we supposed to be reviewing the reviewers here? Aren't we entitled to our own opinions? Isn't that the purpose of a review? What about free speech? Anyway, the point I wanted to make here is that the great Voice of History has spoken. Apparently enough people thought this film was so bad that you can't even purchase it as a stand alone DVD. It had to be double billed with Sonatine. There must be a reason why the people who make the DVDs thought that it wasn't worth trying to sell as a standalone. This happened even as the one, the only, true, great Zatoichi, Shintaro Katsu, has just about all of the original Zatoichi movies now out just recently on DVD for the first time in the U.S.. I rest my case. Long live the only real Zatoichi! He doesn't have to double bill with anyone.",1092528000,8,3640,4.391111111111111
1904258,4,B0000A9D4A,"""Zatoichi"" the old series is considered as movies for the blokes.  The storyline is rather straight-forward: a Robin Hood of small villages during the Edo period, dispensing his kind of street justice against the yakuzas with vengeance instead of robbing the rich to give to the poor.  There's never any subplots such as love interest, or trying to elaborate further what made him the person that he is or what made him blind at the first place.  He's simply an enigmatic blind masseur who trekked from village to village and who's got a rather lethal skill that would come in handy when he needs it.  When Takeshi Kitano took over the helm for this project, I am curious what kind of spin would he put to the original ""Zatoichi"".  As we all know too well, sometimes, the changes to the original are so dramatic that towards the end, we can only say that the new series is ""inspired"" or ""loosely based"" upon the original.  I'm truly gratified and satisfied that the new version of ""Zatoichi"" hasn't lost its original humour.  Takeshi plays a rather good ""Zatoichi"" and his natural constant twitch to his face made him look rather menacing and intimidating.  The storyline is simple enough: he befriends two geisha girls whose family is obliterated by a yakuza gang when they were young.  As a result, being victim of circumstances, they resort to rob the unsuspecting men & looking for their killers to seek revenge.  Zatoichi makes this his mission and responsibility to hunt those people down.  Along the way, yakuzas of two factions are fighting one another off.  Zatoichi also befriends a gambler who's constantly out of luck and he's obviously the comic relief for this movie.  Then, there's a ronin (masterless samurai) who plays the tragic victim.  He works for the yakuza for the money to look after his ill-stricken wife.  In the end, he would have a final showdown with Zatoichi.  The conclusion is predictable anyhow.  Then, there's also the final confrontation between Zatoichi and the ultimate yakuza mastermind whose identity remains a secret until the very end.  All the blood, gory, B-grade violent sequences, revelation of the true villain are all utilised in Kill Bill franchise.  For those that want to know where and how Quentin gets his inspiration, this is a good opportunity.  The final scene is where all actors and actresses come altogether to do a tap dancing sequence mimicking the village celebration of ridding of the bad elements by Zatoichi!  You can say that it is the Tokyo's version of ""Stomp"".  Black humour comes aplenty.  For those that are familiar with Takeshi Kitano's career, all the actors here (good and bad guys alike) are and have been working alongside with him since his early days, akin to Saturday Night Live crew in the States.  This is not just a well-made movie but a well-gelled movie.  Truly fun to watch.  I guess what made this movie appealing to both the old and young generations would be Takeshi's talent in spotting what they can emphatise with themselves in this movie.  Highly recommended.",1092268800,14,3051,4.851063829787234
1904259,5,B0000A9D4A,"Blending period drama, Shogun Assassin-style ultra-violence, comedy and Stomp-esque musical interludes, Takeshi Kitano's ""Zatoichi"" is probably the most audacious film to have come out of Japan so far this decade. Kitano - a former comedian who divides his time between gameshow appearances and producing violent gangster flicks - plays the eponymous hero, a blind but deadly samurai who gets off on gambling, chopping wood and putting wrongs to right. It's a masterful turn, and one that Kitano clearly relishes, twitching and chuckling to himself before dispatching enemies with a blink-and-you'll-miss-it flash of his blade.
The plot centres around Zatoichi's battle against the local yakuza and their formidable samurai-for-hire (Ichi the Killer's Tadonabu Asano). There are showdowns aplenty and, when they do come, they're nothing if not spectacular. Digitally-enhanced, cartoony and extremely violent (think: severed limbs and gallons of blood aplenty), the fights are likely to polarise audiences almost as much as the film's climactic, er, tapdance sequence.
In between, we get a revenge drama involving a cross-dressing geisha, a wannabe samurai who charges around wearing little but armour and what looks like a nappy, slapstick galore and numerous musical interludes. In a similar vein to Lars von Trier's Dancer in the Dark, Kitano draws his soundtrack from ambient noises - as Zatoichi wanders, sightless, through the fields, the sounds of workers' hoes builds up into a natural rhythm. It's a cute effect, and one that's deftly employed here, compounding the sense that Zatoichi - though blind - is catching something that everyone around him misses.
What impresses most is how Kitano manages to draw such unlikely elements together and, moreover, make them work so well. I can think of few directors capable of flitting from slapstick to bloodbath, or domestic tragedy to musical setpiece, as convincingly or effortlessly. Even the aforementioned tapdance number, and a lengthy flashback/musical piece midway through, make a curious kind of sense on a second viewing.
Being a Japanese-language film, this one will inevitably get only a limited audience. Those who do make the effort, however, are in for a treat. It wouldn't be overstating the case to say that you've never seen anything quite like this before.",1087948800,26,2327,5.430939226519337

7996301,5,B0000A9D4A,"If you have yet to see a Takeshi Kitano film, you should honestly check out Sontaine (I consider it his best work and it sets the mood and pace you should expect from a Kitano film). Just like his other movies he doesn't use rapid camera angle changes, but he did make it a point to change camera angles slightly more frequently in this flick. The easiest way to describe the movie is by reiterating what Kitano said himself, ""I wanted to make a fun movie, so I added comedy and quickened the pace."" I have to admit, I enjoyed the comedy in this film more so than A Scene at the Sea, but the pacing is still the slow acquired taste you come to expect from Kitano. I recommend the movie to most people, but you really have to appreciate Kitano's approach to film making to real enjoy the movie.",1519344000,,793,4.258278145695364

7996304,5,B0000A9D4A,"This film is nothing short of a masterpiece, and in my view has not received a proper review on Amazon. My main credentials for even attempting a review is that I have not seen any of the other Blind Swordsman films or TV shows. According to several backgrounders on IMDB for the film, this movie -The Blind Swordsman: Zatoichi- was purposefully written as a fresh take on the Zatoichi character. It was not intended to follow suit. Some are disappointed that this movie does not bear the standard. But if you can look at it with fresh eyes you will bear witness to something amazing.

This is a layered and seemingly contradictory film. On the one hand it is a Samurai style blood and guts movie, yet at the same time it can qualify as a chick-flick. The bursts of violence are so over the top, with fake blood squirting everywhere, it's comical. If you ever watched Quentin Tarantinos Kill Bill, and the exaggerated passages with the crazy 88's mayhem taking place, it's like that. In fact Tarantino, who is credited with bringing The Blind Swordsman: Zatoichi into the US, may well have been inspired by the gushing bright red blood from that movie. An IMDB trivia note has writer/director Takeshi Kitano telling the CGI artist he wanted the blood to ""look like flowers blossoming across the screen.""

With the tension of the violence tempered, the sword play acts as punctuation, peeling back the layers of the character dramas taking place. On one level there is an overriding revenge story unfolding; a moving tale of two children who witnessed the massacre of their entire family by ruffians have now grown up, and after feeding and clothing themselves via acts of child prostitution are bent on killing every last gang member who perpetrated the atrocity.

Within the revenge arc there is a 'Fistful of Dollars' style power struggle between two gangs that rule the town and demand protection money from the farmers. A third gang hires a quiet, man-with-no-name Samurai to help wipe out the two ruling gangs. There is also a scattering of characters and establishments that add color to the town; The Sake bar, the crooked gambling den, and even a village idiot.

But if you can't follow the sub-titled plot it doesn't matter! This is also an Art House film, with every frame of the movie exquisitely painted. The rhythm of the score syncs to the video in a way that will almost put you into a state of altered consciousness. In many respects The Blind Swordsman: Zatoichi is a dance. There is a cadence present throughout, with characters moving to the music as they plant seed, build buildings, and actually breaking out in dance at the end of the film. It is a great climax. Overall, this rendition of the Blind Swordsman motif is a heartfelt play that you will watch more than once (that's the chick-flick part).

One thing to keep in mind while you're watching the movie is that there are a series of flashbacks. The movie maker did not go out of his way to distinguish these scenes, so keep your eyes opened.",1514937600,,3021,4.703213610586011
7996305,3,B0000A9D4A,"A great film concept with introduction of CGI for the violent scenes. Compared to other Takeshi Kitano movies, this one was disappointing. Part of what makes his movies amazing is the extreme amount of minimalism in critical elements of movies - dialog, storyline, character development - paired with wit, honesty, irony, stunning visuals, and musical score. What was most lacking in this movie was the score and accompanying music to tell the story alongside the visuals and story. The best part about it was that Yuko Daike got a lot of screen time.",1512259200,2,551,4.935483870967742
7996306,2,B0000A9D4A,"Takeshi Kitano gives us  in this film his tribute to the genre. A plot without anything to say - apart of the bloody encounters - Zatoichi (with blondy hair) exhibits the best of his samurai gifts despite his natural limitations.

Full of commonplaces, funny situations and a disappointing ending, the picture leaves us with a bitter taste. Good entertainment for teenagers.",1512000000,,374,5.114754098360656
