6078064,5,B00GI1EEQQ,"Loved, loved, loved this film.  The folks who did it did a great job of capturing what it is to be a true blue Kentucky basketball fan...it is about basketball, most assuredly - but it is also much more than that!  Truly the greatest tradition in college basketball - and also a program that encourages 'giving back' on the part of so many gifted individuals.  The program has had some great leadership...and that comes through in the film along with all our 'silliness'  GO CATS!!!!  Great job !!!
P.S. I watched it 4 times in the first two weeks I had it - and will watch it many more I am sure...",1388793600,2,599,4.3125
6078065,5,B00GI1EEQQ,"If you are a UK fan, or even if you are not, this is a great documentary on the history of this storied basketball program.  We purchased this for my son for Christmas....he bleeds blue all the way....and he's watched it multiple times!  Personally, I LOVED it!  I cried a little, laughed a little & cheered a lot!  Even if you are a ""hater of UK"", but a ""lover of the game"", you will at least come to appreciate and understand why BBN is so passionate and somewhat ""crazy"".  This documentary was very well done and entertaining.  It was also reasonably priced.  I highly recommend it!  GO CATS!!",1388793600,2,596,4.453703703703703
6078066,5,B00GI1EEQQ,"If you have never lived in Kentucky, you probably won't get this. If you live in Kentucky, you probably won't understand how anyone could NOT get this. Either way, this video is a superb documentary of Big Blue Mania - also know as being a Cats fan. I absolutely loved it. I married a Cats fan and we moved to Lexington where I became a Cats fan, too. If you can live in Lexington without becoming a fan, more power to you, but I don't see how that can be done. This is beautifully demonstrated in the video. UK Wildcat fans are the best in the world, and if you've been a fan for any length of time you say exactly where you were when different games happened - and why you STILL hate Laettner!",1388016000,3,695,4.155555555555556
6078067,5,B00GI1EEQQ,"This movies brings out all the emotions.  You will laugh, you will cry and you will CHEER!  Great movie that covers all aspects of the Big Blue Nation and their devotion and dedication. A wonderful gift for the fan that has everything UK related.",1384646400,6,246,4.568181818181818
6078068,5,B00GI1EEQQ,Very well done movie by and for UK fans!  We watched the premiere at the Kentucky Theatre.  Try to catch it on the big screen.,1384387200,,126,4.0
6078069,5,B00GI1EEQQ,"If you are a Kentucky basketball fan, whether you're an alumni or not, this is great. I got an advance copy because I made a Kickstarter donation, and I've watched it 3 times already. It is exceptionally well done, and captures the essence of what it means to be a member of the Nation of Blue. Living in football-mad Texas, this documentary makes me feel like I'm back in Lexington again. If you know a UK basketball fan, put this in their Christmas stocking. Better yet, if you know a Duke or Louisville fan, buy it for them to make them jealous.",1384387200,9,548,4.382352941176471

6078072,3,B00GI1EEQQ,"Enjoyed the movie, but not as much as I thought I would (and I am diehard Ky basketball fan).",1410652800,,93,3.9473684210526314
6078073,5,B00GI1EEQQ,"OK....if you are Wildcats fan and you bleed Blue, this film can only be a five star rating and a must own.  If you are a Blue Devil or a Cardinal, or, yuk, a Hoosier, you probably will get sick. This if a film about being a Kentucky fan and there is soo much Blue in it!  I loved it all, but, hey, y'all, I was born in Kentucky, graduated at UK and bleed Blue. So...so HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",1410566400,2,387,3.948717948717949

6078079,5,B00GI1EEQQ,"This DVD captures the true blue Kentucky basketball fan.  A Kentucky fan can name all the players, tell you how they're doing, and understand the game so they know a bad call when they see it.  The DVD shows how much fun it is , the intense loyalty and also the stress of a close game, close games make me a nervous wreck.  If you belong to the BBN you'll enjoy this DVD",1389052800,,370,4.041095890410959
