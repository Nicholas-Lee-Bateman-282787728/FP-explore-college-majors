8479341,5,B005MAG8S6,"Two of my daughters are from Liberia and came out of the war.  I kept current on what was happening in the news but I never heard about the women of Liberia, all religions, coming together to bring peace.  Wearing white T-Shirts and using peaceful protest, sitting along the roads, talking in their churches and mosques, filling the hallways of the ""peace"" talks while the men smoked, drank and argued in the resort.
