3101938,5,B00133QNRC,"I have a two year old that just loves this show.  It's done a great job teaching her the alphabet in an entertaining way, and isn't annoying like most kids TV these days.  As for the DVD, it has a very appropriate run time for the price.  You can't go wrong.",1216944000,,258,4.019607843137255
3101939,5,B00133QNRC,"This has been a great cartoon series for my 3 & 5 year olds to work on building words with the letters they already know.  The characters are fun and I love the concept of using the words as the physical make-up of the body of whatever they're spelling.  Great visual for kids.

Highly educational and even my 2 year old begs for Word World!",1215302400,,341,4.2153846153846155
3101940,4,B00133QNRC,"My son loves letters and the alphabet. Well, he used to when he was two. Now he loves Care Bears. But back when he loved letters, we found this DVD series. We don't watch much tv or movies at home. But I was pregnant and feeling pretty agreeable to do anything that involved anyone else entertaining him that wasn't me. We found Word World and I have to admit not only did he learn how to spell some words and songs, but I was entertained too. I was especially pleased by how positive the series is. Highly recommend. Dog is our favorite character.",1213833600,10,548,4.330097087378641

3101972,3,B00133QNRC,"First, the bad: The length of each episode is short. I feel they should have put more episodes on each dvd. When compared to other preschool videos, this is short. Curious George is a much better deal! Also, they sneak advertisements in unexpected places. I usually make sure to skip the promotional material for my daughter, but these guys are sneaky about where they put it, and that's not playing fair.

That said, I love WordWorld! The stories really help my preschooler with putting words together and how different letters function together. Some subjects are treated too lightly (e.g., treating fall migration as a vacation), but I suppose you can't accomplish all learning goals with one product (unless you're Sesame Street!).
