2912786,5,B000TZJBKG,"The first season of Kyou Kara Maou has 39 episodes split up into 9 seperate DVDs. If you buy the limited collector's edition, you'll get a small purple box made out of pretty low-quality cardboard (of some sort). Golden writing makes the box set look pretty cool, although it is slightly off angle. There's a piece of paper with all of the series information:

  -975 min
  -English/Japanese Dolby Digital 2.0 with English Subtitles
  -Widescreen

  The paper is literally glued on, off angle on the back. A little surprising in its lack of quality, especially for the price. There's a small, plastic latch that closed the box on the side - I don't think it's last long, especially without much care. On the inside, hard plastic sleeves hold the DVDs on either side. The ""spine"" of the box-book is made out of plastic I'm afraid to open more than three inches due to its britality. The overall quality of the box is rather low for being such an expensive item - I'm not very happy with the packaging, but the series is such a great one, I'm willing to over look it.

  I have yet to watch the full season over again - comments on the English cast and Enlglish subbing will be coming.",1214265600,8,1183,4.497652582159624
2912787,4,B000TZJBKG,"Kyou Kara Maou starts out as the clasic reverse harem magical girl scenareo with a twist, and turns into something much more original and fun. The humour is spot on, and the plot when existant, is compelling. Unfortunetly, this series has not been completed in an R1 release, but the first season is the essential Kyou Kara Maou, so it is definitely worth buying this set, which has the first 38 episodes in a very convenient format.",1211846400,,433,4.636363636363637
2912788,5,B000TZJBKG,Kyo Kara Maoh is a great anime series. It's a great combination of fantasy and comedy. You'll find yourself becoming attached to the characters relatively quickly. They all have distinct personalities and create an interesting dynamic. Do not pass this one up! The fact that Geneon is out of business shouldn't prevent you from getting into a great story. It'll be picked up again in the states eventually and there's always imports.,1203638400,,433,5.027777777777778
2912789,5,B000TZJBKG,"Imagine if you will... an awkward 15 year baseball minded boy named Yuri Shibuya is biking home from school when he encounters three punks picking on an old classmate.  He interferes (against his better judgment) and ends up almost getting a swirlie in the girl's bathroom.  Almost because he actually gets flushed into an alternate world where black haired - black eyed people are objects of fear: rare demons.  He is saved by a handsome man who somehow already knows his name and is told he is actually the long lost king of the Great Demon Kingdom.  That's the first episode in a nutshell.

Kyo Kara Maoh is an interesting, well written, and well cast anime from a series of light novels.  While it has its funny, lighthearted moments, there are also many serious notes as Yuri finds his footing in this new world and a path he wants to walk as the 27th Demon King.  There are currents of prejudice, vengeance, and the sorrows of war that carry scars and grudges well after the last line is drawn. It has a bit of a ""male harem"" feel to it, and the shonen-ai elements are light and don't take itself seriously at all.

The draw of the anime, however, is the characters themselves. Yuri is a sweet, naive, and old fashioned in his values which translates even when he goes ""Demon King"" (a thing which you will just have to see for yourself.  It's breathtaking every time.)  His male lieges are all handsome, but they all have their quirks, as well, which makes them even more likable. Wolfram (the selfish pooh), youngest of three brothers, is Yuri's accidental fiance (never smack anyone on their left cheek... it's a proposal) and gets used to idea pretty quickly.  Conrad, the middle brother, is the shining prince who was there to see the birth of the new king and now serves as bodyguard.  He's practically perfect in everyway.  Gwendal, the stern older brother, practically runs the Great Demon Kingdom in his abscence.  He's very handy with his hands, too.  Gunter, the tutor, is easily the most graceful, and fanatic of the lieges.  His love for his king knows no bounds and watching his expressions is one of the highlights of the show.  The female characters, while not seen often, make quite the impression as well.  From Yuri's mother Miko (Jennifer of the Beach) Shibuya, a cute, young looking woman whose advice is never far from Yuri's mind, to Annissina, the determined (and quite frightening) inventor and Gwendal's childhood friend, to Celi, the beautiful former Demon Queen and mother to the three brothers.

The show runs at a good clip, and everything is endearing from the music, to the characters, to the animation itself.  It's a good buy, and one you'll be watching again and again.",1200614400,4,2709,4.6991525423728815
2912790,1,B000TZJBKG,purple case that discs come in is terrible they fall out constantly and does not protect them tried to return but was advised that they will send one blank disc case as expensive as this was box is very cheap,1199664000,,208,4.225
2912791,5,B000TZJBKG,"First, a little information about the series itself:

There are two seasons in KKM, 39 episodes per each. Also, there are, I believe, five OVAs as well, exclusively released in Japan (first one came out March 2007, second one is scheduled to be released in early to mid December 2007). However, it is unclear as to whether or not the series will even continue in the US since Geneon has made a public statement that their ""sales of DVDs and all related distribution and marketing operations as of 5 p.m. on Friday, September 28, 2007"" will cease.

However, hopefully the fans can take solace in believing that another big-name corp. will get the rights to continue to distribute the rest of this great anime (maybe Funimation will pick it up? *hopehopehope*).

Unfortunately, there has yet to be any word if the rest of Season 2 will be English dubbed and released. Currently the series is on and has released the English dubbed version of Season 2, Disc 6, and up to episode 62, so they only have 16 more episodes to go until the entire series is finished an done with! (Plus the OVAs).

However, as for the anime itself:

The story centers around a 15 year old Japanese boy named Yuuri Shibuya. A rather awkward teen, Yuuri finds himself transported to another world where people like him (black hair and eyes) are considered royalty! Not only that but they believe HE is their king! Within this strange world that borders a magical theme park (at least in Yuuri's opinion) he meets many people, impacting each to the point of gradual change for the better of the Shin Makoku (Demon Kingdom). He befriends other leading characters such as Conrad, Gunter, Wolfram, and Gwendal, all which start off with a unique relationship with the king.

Filled with intense action-packed adventure, moralistic understanding of prejudice, and the devastation that is war, this anime also has a softer, more humorous side and harbors what's called a ""male harem"" (where the majority of the characters are beautiful males surrounding a central male), but considered by many as ""shonen-ai"" since it has brief references to homosexuality (nothing happens, it's just cute and free-minded). Many consider it shonen-ai mostly because the first plot twist consists of Yuuri, the new Maoh (king) of Shin Makoku, getting himself, unknowingly, engaged to a bishounen (beautiful boy) by way of picking up silverware!

All in all, this is a great series to get into, so I definitely recommend it!",1195603200,11,2470,4.880668257756564
2912802,2,B000TZJBKG,"That's probably an entirely personal matter of taste, but he just ruined the whole show for me.  I bought it on sale and the first half hour looks great but it sort of goes down hill.  The hero should have been best friends and had more adventures  with the admirable Conrad.  This show was almost a three but I gave it a two out of frustration.  Go watch or buy ""07-Ghost"" instead.  That is a hundred times better.

If you google it on the internet you can buy ""O-7 Ghost"".",1271980800,,474,4.2

2912805,3,B000TZJBKG,"I'm going to keep it some what short, since pretty much everything has been summarized to a point.  To be honest I bought this movie thinking it was a boys love w/800 and some minutes, how wrong I was.  When I purchased my dvd there were no reviews at that time, poor me.  Well anyway, this movie as the other reviewer stated could get pretty annoying.  I do understand that we're dealing w/a child, but it would have been more interesting if he could have stayed in his demon form more.  The demon king is a goody goody w/grand ideas that everyone should get along.  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for the happy ending, but give me some substance please.  To me, he gets in trouble and someone has to bell him out, which puts the other person in harms way and then he wants to feel sorry for himself.  I had to watch this movie in segments due to he irritated me soo bad.  Over-all its not bad, but it can get on your nerves, so don't expect too much, but its something to watch when you want to pass the time.  Still trying to decide if I want to get season 2 because it did have its moments and of course you would like to know what happens.",1267488000,,1141,4.122171945701357
2912806,3,B000TZJBKG,"Kyo Kara Maoh!  I won't summarize the story because, chances are, you've probably read the other reviews.  So, let's talk about the product.

Kyo Kara Maoh is the kind of anime that you watch during your early teen years.  It is like anime shows that comes out on tv during Saturday mornings. Not too complex, but not overly simplistic.  It has a variety of genres but it is mainly comprised of fantasy and humour.

The packaging is great.  It contains 5 nice thin packs (however thin pack #3-4 are ugly because they won't close) housing the 9 discs containing the 39 episodes of the first season.

The story is average - boy travels to another world and saves it - but it has a little twist added to it. It develops very slowly but the humour helps you get by.  However, the humour gets annoying at times and ruins good serious moments.  Nevertheless, it is engaging and is quite fun to watch.  So, if you are looking for a deep anime, this anime will not satisfy your tastes.

The animation is okay/average/bland.  It doesn't give you much ""______"" to your eyes.  Sometimes, the mouth is the only thing moving in a frame.  It's not on par with the other animes when it comes to animation.  As I've said earlier, it is just like an anime made for saturday mornings.  However, it is passable and gets better over time.

The music varies from boring, good, and average.  But it doesn't get irritating.  You'll get accustomed to it.

Overall, if you prefer an anime with a great story/animation/music, this anime is defenitely not for you.  But if you want an anime for the sake of watching an anime, Kyo kara moah! is for you because it is fun and engaging.  I usually buy animes for their story (i.e. Death note, samurai 7), but I gave this anime a chance and I'm glad I did because I quite enjoyed it.

3 1/2 stars.",1262649600,,1816,4.433333333333334
2912807,4,B000TZJBKG,"You could certainly be forgiven if you were initially suspicious of any title that opens with the premise of a schoolboy getting a ""swirly"".  In case you aren't familiar with the technique, it is one in which a bully or group of bullies take a weaker individual, flip them upside down, dip their face into the toilet and flush.  In normal circumstances, aside from being terribly unhygienic, the only long-term affect to the victim is a bit of a tall, twisted hairdo.  Believe it or not, Kyo kara Maoh! Opens with our lead character on the receiving end of one such tactic only rather than simply twisting his do, this toilet happens to be a transporter to a magical realm.  We don't even want to know if it worked on the same principle for countless not-so-pleasant flushes, but either way...

Released in full season collections, Funimation is once again bringing the Geneon classic title to the masses.  At the time of this review's writing both the first and second volume have been released.  The first box set (Season 1) contains 39 episodes across nine discs (thin packs within a very attractive cardboard slipcase).  The second box set consists of the 37 episodes that constitute the complete second season but since this review if of the first release, let's stick to those specs for now.

The collection comes in at a whopping 975-minute runtime and packs a nice host of special features.  Among these are a conceptual art and image gallery, textless themes, memory slideshow, promos, and previews for upcoming Funimation releases.

Language options are of the sub & dub variety; original Japanese dialog and English dub each presented in Dolby Digital 2.0 and the choice of English subtitles below either.

The show wears an appropriate13 & Up rating.  Appropriate because while there's nothing extremely offensive for the youngsters, it's quite possible that children around the age of 13 will get the most entertainment out of the multitude of gags presented here (after all, its doubtful they would have needed my above definition of a swirly).

The story goes something like this: Yuri Shibuya happens upon a new and wild world once bullies stick his head in the toilet. After encountering some nobles and discovering that the world as he knew it was no more, our hero discovers that he's the long-awaited Demon King (and here you thought he had it bad enough just surviving high school).

It turns out that in this new world (called the ""Great Demon Kingdom""), humans are the enemy and though considered a human in our world, Yuri is classified as a demon there.  Not just any demon at that; but rather the one who could balance out the tension between the humans and the demos.

After a brief return to Earth, Yuri is forced to contemplate which world is more to his liking. Long story short, thus begins young Yuri's reign as Demon King.  Did I mention that magic is a fact of life in the Demon Kingdom but the catch is it only works in the thralls of battle?  Yuri will learn these things just as the viewer does and more often than not: it's too little, too late.

If your still with me after all of this, let me just say that it was all be completely and hopelessly ridiculous except for one redeeming quality; It's pretty darn funny at times.

Kyo kara Maoh! has the distinction of combining fantasy elements with comedic charm to such accord that it harkens back to some of Monty Python's earlier works.  Each episode is driven along by a fantasy inspired plot structure (find the magic sword, figure out a way to get back home, learn how to cast spells, etc.) but actually consists of dozens of silly humorous moments to connect the grander dots.  Need examples? Well Yuri ends up accidentally getting himself engaged to be married (to another man) by the second episode, encounters some jiggly sumo wrestlers, pirates in schoolgirl uniforms, and gets up close and personal to a g-string by the fifth episode!

The offbeat and prevalent humor presented here depends heavily on its cast of characters.  Luckily it works, much to the credit of the show's writers.  Wolfram's snappish attitude makes a great counterpoint to Yuri's easygoing nature.  The women aren't forgotten either, take Celi (the former Demon Queen) and her forceful personality and the eccentric inventor Anissina who has more tricks up her sleeve than a Vegas poker pro.

The music works really well with upbeat rock beats in the lighter moments that switch subtly to orchestral scores when the tension goes to red alert phase. Geneon's dub, though pale to the efforts of Funimation's more recent stuff, maintains the comedic intentions of the program.  The script, however, does take a few ugly twists in effort to ""Americanize"" some of the jokes and puns.  It is serviceable if you've only experienced the show in English but starts to lose ground once you compare it to the original Japanese script.

In all, this is a show that could be considered an instant classic or a blend of sheer strangeness depending entirely upon your mood going in.  The fantasy elements work really well in both languages and the humor is equally addicting (especially in the Japanese version).  However, if you were seeking a well plotted, fantasy adventure, you would probably better off looking into the much-less gimmicked One Piece series.

I came in not knowing what to expect and came out quite amused.  It's silly for sure, but sometimes that's exactly what you were looking for, even if you didn't know it.",1248393600,21,5490,4.810436634717785
2912808,4,B000TZJBKG,"Kyo Kara Maoh is the story of Yuri Shibuya (or Shibuya Yuri if you're watching in Japanese) a 15 year old high school student who gets sucked into an alternate world. And yes, he gets there through a toilet the first time. But stay with me here. Yuri awakens in a medieval type village and is informed shortly thereafter that he is the new Demon King (the Maoh of the title). It seems that Yuri, with his black hair and black eyes, is an extremely rare type in this world. He also has incredible magical abilities that he never knew about. Included in the story are conflicts between the humans and demons, unusual creatures (flying skeletons anyone?), swordfighting, a reluctant king, and a healthy dose of humor. Actually some of the side stories are downright silly. But despite it all Kyo Kara Maoh is a really great show.
Season one starts off well and treads water for a while in the middle but it ends on a high note. A few filler episodes are to be expected when one season has 39 episodes so it's forgiveable. Filler aside, it's really grown on me. The main plot that's begun in season 1 carries over through all of season 2. It works out in a very interesting way too despite a slightly slow start. I can't recommend it enough. I'm also biding my time until the Season 2 set is available and holding out hope that Season 3 will be released for the English speakers eventually too.
Kyo Kara Maoh has a great cast of characters and has a fun sense of humor. It's also suprisingly little kid friendly. With a bit of editing, even younger kids can enjoy it which is nice. Most anime is really not child friendly so it's always good to find one that is.
Now for the details of the set: Season one is 39 episodes which are split into 9 different discs. The discs are packed into slim line cases, two to a case (except for the 9th which is by itself). As with all slim line cases, the discs are liable to pop out of the cases but the packaging is otherwise pretty nice. The cases include the original cover art from the previous set (this is a rerelease) and list the episode names with a few screenshots. All of this fits into a box which is a little on the thin side but keeps them together and neat all the same. And all 9 discs have both Japanese and English audio along with subtitles. They also include a few extras like slide shows and trailers for other shows. So the pricetag might be a little high but you get a lot of show for your money. You hardly even need any extras.
Oh and I have to say, the Japanese audio is way better than the English dub for this show. I watched most of season 1 in English the first time around and couldn't stand Wolfram (Yuri's accidental fiance. Yes, a man. In the Great Demon Kingdom they do that). Many of the voices are better in Japanese so I recommend watching it that way. Plus if you're a fan of the Gravitation anime, Gunther shares a voice with Yuki Eiri.",1245888000,5,2909,4.310218978102189

It is used lightly and in a humorous way. I'd say appropriate for children 10 and up, but to be safe lets say PG-13.",1242086400,,404,4.4

8211595,5,B000TZJBKG,"Man, when my sister told me about this series, it didn't sound interesting until she told me it's like Fushigi Yugi...only difference is it's an ordinary boy named Yuuri pulled into the Demon World through a toilet after trying to save a student he use to know when he was younger (that ran off on him). In the demon world (which is implied to be Germany given the outfits of all the characters) he is suddenly attacked by people who accuse him of being a demon and almost killed. He is saved by a handsome man named Conrad who snatches him up and takes him back to the Mazoku Kingdom (the demon kingdom) where he explains the situation. Yuuri is apparently the next in line to become the demon king because of a prophecy and because of his appearance of being a double black demon (black eyes and hair is exceptionally rare). Yuuri honestly isn't interested and just wants to go home but as he sees the situation with the human and demons, he is pulled into restoring piece to the other world and preventing a war from breaking out.

Unlike Fushigi Yugi, Kyo Kara Maoh is a comedy series and unlike Fushigi Yugi, Kyo Kara Maou (or God Save Our King) is very idealistic. In fact, this series is the most idealistic series I have EVER seen. Despite the series being a comedy, the plot and topics talked about are VERY SERIOUS. In fact, the series evolves into an action series and gets more serious as time goes on (to the point that season 3 is rather dark compared to the other two seasons.) Yuuri's naive nature which would get him killed in any other series, proves to be a good thing as his naive nature is what is needed to prevent war. The themes of this series include, war, death, RACISM (the biggest of the bunch), slavery, segregation AND massacres. You wouldn't believe that by looking at the cute cover.

This is only season 1 so I'll only cover the events of this season (the rest can be ranted on the season 2 boxset). The first season is basically Yuuri getting accustomed to the demon world and learning the problems that need to be fixed and trying to fix it. The end of season 1 is them coming back to the demon kingdom beaten and confused (won't explain why because it's a plot twist). Because this season is introducing many characters that would show up a lot during season 2, its mainly just small arcs that last 2-4 episodes with fillers only being one episode.

In season 1, I will confess that there is hardly any character development because you are being introduced to everyone. However, Wolfram is the only character that shows signs of any character development and by season 2, he is a different person. As the youngest son of the Von Bielefeld (the previous family in charge of ruling the Mazoku kingdom), he is very stuck up, spoiled and obnoxious. He's not a likable character even if he's a tsundere at the beginning. It only takes one episode for Yuuri to knock some sense into him...and by that I mean accidentally proposing to him via slapping him on the cheek and then dueling him, getting his butt kicked in the process. You could literally save ""Love at first punch"" for these two because after that, Wolfram takes his engagement to Yuuri very seriously. Yes this is played for comedy except for shippers like me but its to be noted that in later series, the relationship is not that much comedy anymore given how Wolfram takes the pride of being Yuuri's fiance to actually falling in love with him. I mean, they get a couple of episodes to developing their love for each other (as much as Yuuri denies being gay and the irony is that in this world, homosexuality isn't a problem. Race is.) But later on after a certain event, Wolfram finally decides to change as a person and this will be covered in the season 2 review.

Overall, a great series to start if you're find with the homoerotic subtext in this series (and probably one of the few series that makes it believable without calling this series a yaoi or even shonen ai.) It has comedy, adventure, action (yes it has a lot of fighting in it given how war is such a huge role in the series), a split personality (Yuuri fights with a split personality that emerges when he's angry), cross-dressing and a lot of drama near the end of season 1. It's a very well-balanced package in retrospect~",1362355200,2,4288,4.500641848523748

The first episode starts with King Yuri saving his friend and getting flushed down the toilet into the Demon Kingdom where he becomes the King. From episode 1 you start off with action, drama and laughs. It caught my attention and I just couldn't stop watching this Anime.
The characters keep developing throughout the season and you can't help but fall in love with them. Even the annoying characters that are constantly whining you can't help but like especially the more of the Anime you watch. The story line is also great! The whole season leads up to the Kingdom needing to locate the 4 boxes that the Originators have been sealed away in. There are many filler episodes in this Anime (like with all Anime) however the filler episodes introduce characters that will play major roles in the series later on.
With not having high hopes for this Anime, it has quickly jumped it's way up to my top three favorites. I LOVE this Anime and can't wait for Funimation to pick up season 3!
