5109013,2,B007RMQ52Q,"I was excited to see this, being a big fan of the book and the original movie version.  This one would seem to have all the elements: a faithful adaptation of a great story, and a good cast.  Yet it failed pretty dramatically in my view.  Why?  Mainly the trappings.

It didn't ""feel"" like a pirate movie.  None of the cast acted like pirates.  It felt like it was shot in somebody's summer cabin rather than on a tropical island.  I didn't even buy it as a period piece, it seemed much more modern.  And then they made inexplicable changes to the characters.  The doctor is now a really pathetic coward (why?) And Jim is very duplicitous.  And instead of being a generally likeable bumbler, the Squire is now this evil schemer.  I don't understand, and certainly don't like the changes.

Bah, well, hopefully somebody else will make another attempt.",1345334400,6,850,4.586666666666667
5109014,3,B007RMQ52Q,"Gone are the days when people would sit reading classic tales that had been handed down from generation to generation. Stories and books that were once required reading are now passed over for the more popular fare these days. That's sad in so many ways. Stories that once captured the imaginations of children are now ignored. The only way these stories come to life these days is when children see them in film or television format. That would be great except that children rarely seek out the original source and that film makers have a tendency to remake the original in their own mold. Such is the case here.

TREASURE ISLAND is a fantastic book to read and author Robert Louis Stevenson wrote so well that the descriptions and story come alive when reading it. The book has been made into a film more than once, the most famous starring Wallace Beery in 1934 and Robert Newton in 1950. Both stuck to the story at hand and told of the adventures of young Jim Hawkins and the infamous pirate Long John Silver. This new production does the same but alters the tale a bit.

Rather than start with the arrival of Billy Bones at the Inn Jim and his mother run, it starts with Capt. Flint and his treachery towards his crew only then returning to the original tale. Bones holes up in the Inn and tells Jim to let him know if he sees any sea faring man arrive. When one does, Bones knows his days are numbered. After he dies, Jim takes control of his possessions including a treasure map he finds. Seeking help from friend and local doctor Livesy, the pair unite with Squire Trelawney and set out in search of the hidden fortune.

This is where a couple of major changes kick in. First off in the original story we had no idea who Silver was as he works his way into the adventure that these three plan only to reveal himself at a later time. Since he was in the opening sequences we know who he is and what he plans from the start. Secondly, the character of Squire Trelawney in the original was a benevolent person who wanted to help and share with Jim and the doctor. In this version he is an evil man who intends nothing of the sort but instead hopes to take control of the entire treasure once found leaving his companions nothing. This is a major change and feels wrong in every sense of the word.

As the company prepares to sail Silver gets himself hired on as cook. When there seems to be a shortage of sailors to make the tide, he inserts members of his past crew in key positions to help him later take over the ship. None of this is apparent to Jim as he first enjoys the adventure he is on and later begins to think of forming a pact with Silver after Trelawney has told him and the doctor his intentions.

Treachery is the name of the game here and eventually Silver and his men take over the ship once they get to the island. His position of captain of this pirate crew is called into question on more than one occasion, something else differing from the original book. As those that remain hole up in the abandoned fort left on the island, Silver and his men set out to take back the map and pilfer the treasure for themselves. Just who will walk away from the island with treasure in hand waits to be seen.

With the popularity of the PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN films it would seem that this would be a movie just waiting to be remade and apparently those in charge thought so as well. It's just too bad that like most storytellers these days remaking films they decided that it wasn't good enough on it's own merits and decided to change so much of it. Rather than rely on a book that was written so long ago and enjoyed by countless millions, it is turned into a story that barely resembles the original and fails due to the changes that are made. Film makers should learn to leave well enough alone when it comes to classics because they rarely make changes that work.

One also has to wonder why it is that a movie at one time could tell an entire story in 90 minutes yet film makers today seem intent of shooting something that's no less than 2 hours and often times, as is the case her, up to 3 hours long. Perhaps it was so that this film could be a two evening event on television but for me it did nothing more than drag on. If TREASURE ISLAND is the movie you want to see then pass this one by. The only good thing it has to offer is Eddie Izzard as Silver. He does a tremendous job in the role. If only he had played the famous character instead of this one.",1344470400,2,4482,4.278301886792453
5109015,2,B007RMQ52Q,"Saw this on TV.

Not so much as a hint of humour, the script shoots for deadly serious but achieves deadly dull. Over all this tries to make the classic Stevenson story more edgy and contemporary but it all ends up seemly forced and overdone. Far too ""post modern punk"" and not enough ""pirate"".

I have been a fan of Eddie Izzard's film work and stand up but for this....""Meh"". Not a great casting as ""Long John"" IMHO. He mostly looks bored.

Almost any other flim version of Treasure Island beats this.

Two stars just 'cause I managed to sit through it.",1340928000,3,555,4.411764705882353
5109016,4,B007RMQ52Q,"Like a few others, I was a bit surprised to enjoy this version. Eddie Izzard was OK as Long John, but he always shows through his character a bit.

5109017,4,B007RMQ52Q,"Having read the book, I was curious to see how close the movie would follow the story. Overall, the movie did a very good job. There were some artistic liberties taken, when aren't there, but these changes did not severely alter the overall storyline. I liked that the pirates were portrayed realistically and not softened up to make them come across like buffoons or simpletons. Eddie Izzard did a great job of portraying Long John Silver, so much so that I can understand how Jim Hawkins could be torn between like and detesting the man all at the same time. Will definitely purchase for my media library.",1336953600,10,607,4.682242990654205
5109018,4,B007RMQ52Q,"""I will plan a venture Jim Hawkins and we will both profit wildly. Trust me boy."" After Long John Silver (Izzard) is double crossed by his captain Flint (Sutherland) he only has one thing on his mind. Retreiving the treasure he feels is rightly his. When finding out that the only one who can get a ship to the island where the treasure is is a young boy named Jim Hawkins (Regbo) he makes friends with him. I have never seen any of the other versions of this nor read the book. I knew a little of the story but to me this was about 90% new to me. Even though this is a made for TV movie it is much better then most of the theater movies that have been released recently. Izzard is a perfect choice for this and I think is on par with Depp. This movie is very entertaining and I recommend it. This is a pirate movie that can stand side by side with the first ""Pirates Of The Carribbean"" movie, and may actually be better in some ways. This is a movie well worth your time. Overall, best pirate movie since the original Pirates. I enjoyed it. I say B+.",1336608000,11,1051,4.106796116504855
5109019,5,B007RMQ52Q,"I'm a big fan of the original story and this is hands down my favorite film version of Treasure Island. The acting is excellent and Eddie Izzard played the role of John Silver perfectly. There are some minor changes to the original Robert Louis Stevenson story but it works for the film and the main core of the story is intact. Parents should keep in mind, this version is a bit darker and more serious than previous softer, more family friendly versions of Treasure Island, but that is my main reason for liking this one so much.

5109020,1,B007RMQ52Q,This was the worst version I have ever seen. The story line was way off the map and barely what Robert Louis Stephenson created in his book. The 1990 treasure Island with Charelton Heston was the best movie ever made of Treasure Island...,1336348800,10,238,4.558139534883721
5109021,1,B007RMQ52Q,"Don't expect this version to follow the book!  While I thought the idea of having black pirates is AWESOME (to make it 100% more authentic!), the ""liberties"" taken by either the director or screenwriter are just too much for me...  Silver is cool and Jim is alright, but the rest of the main characters are just lousy!  Ben Gunn is TERRIBLE!  The squire is an absolute ass (not like that at all in the book), the doctor is a candy-ass (again, he's not like that in the book) and Captain Smollet isn't much better.  And the characters are just all over the place (sometimes good, sometimes not).  Personally, my favorite version of this classic story is still the one with Christian Bale and Charleton Heston.  This one had my interest until they got to the island.  Then it just veered WAY TOO much from the story.",1487808000,,814,4.527397260273973

5109055,2,B007RMQ52Q,"This started so well, I wanted to love it.  Izzard was by far the greatest asset to this film -- sort of a sane Oliver Reed.  We could have used more of Donald Sutherland, who plays a wicked Captain Flint, and Philip Glenister was great as Captain Smolett (he played Gene in the TV series Life On Mars). Jim Hawkins is well played by the young actor, and his mother, played by Shirley Henderson (Topsy Turvey) does a great job with her role.

*Possible spoilers*

Clouds gathered on the horizon with peculiar intimations of more ""additional background"" on key characters than was found in Stevenson's original book, until the cloudburst broke with the speech where the squire cheats Jim and the doctor out of their share of the treasure in an offhand scene on board the Hispaniola.  It finally dawned on me that the Squire is now a rapacious, duplicitous villain (instead of a generous, morally upright man) and Dr. Livesy is now a coward in this alternate universe.  The key ""apple barrel"" scene is usurped, and Jim does not warn anyone of Long John Silver's plot, but instead leaves everyone to be ambushed.  Now the film becomes a tedious struggle against types, for one who has read the book, and it became impossible for me to enjoy the film.  The final nail in the coffin was an impossible turn by Elijah Wood as Ben Gunn.

Skip it.",1421712000,,1338,4.588235294117647
5109056,4,B007RMQ52Q,"As a fan of the book ""Treasure Island,"" I'll say that this movie is, for the most part, a very clever adaptation.

The plot follows the book fairly closely. Granted, that may not be saying much, since the two main adaptations people from my generation are familiar with are the Muppet version and ""Treasure Planet."" This is the first straightforward adaptation of ""Treasure Island"" that I've seen. But it kept very close to the book's plot outline and cast of characters; the only major changes were in how the characters were interpreted, and a ""twist"" to the ending.

The changes to the characters, for the most part, enhance the story. As with most adaptations, Long John Silver is sympathetic and genuinely cares for Jim (those who haven't read the book might be surprised to learn that the original Silver was a straightforward, one-dimensional villain). Billy Bones is now Jamaican, possibly because no adaptation could ever out-do the British Billy Bones that ""Muppet Treasure Island"" gave us; and in any case, the Jamaican Billy works. The writers even managed to up the female count in the cast, without hindering the story; Jim's mother and Silver's wife (mentioned in the book) are given a subplot that lets them shine, without being unbelievable for the story. (Jim's mother *must* have faced problems back home, trying to run the bankrupt inn, and it's plausible that Silver would leave his wife in charge of some of his business at home).

The only two changes that fail are the take on Squire Tralawney, and the ""twist"" ending. Both are horribly clichd. In the book Tralawney was ""the half-wit squire,"" and basically brought in comic relief; in this version, he's turned into a snooty, greedy aristocrat, because with Silver now sympathetic, *someone* has to be the ""real"" bad guy. (And apparently there weren't enough other pirates to fill that role.) As for the ""surprise"" ending, it will hardly shock anyone who watched cartoons in the '90s. Just think about how every treasure hunt episode of ""Tiny Toons"" or ""Little Bear"" ended. And in this story it's particularly infuriating, because Jim actually NEEDS that treasure to save his impoverished mother. Luckily, Silver sneaks a few coins away and gives them to Jim when they part ways.

This film has simultaneously the strangest and best cast for a ""Treasure Island"" adaptation. Eddie Izzard as Long John? Elija Wood as Ben Gunn? Donald Sutherland as Cap'n Flint? Moaning Myrtle as Jim's mother? And yet, it all works, brilliantly. Eddie Izzard brings a jolly, eccentric persona to Silver, sort of like what Jack Sparrow would be if he were sober. Elija Wood becomes a sort of Gollum wannabe (in a good way) as Ben Gunn. Shirley Henderson makes Jim's mother innocent and sheltered, but determined, rather than the swooning, gold-digging wimp she's implied to be in the book. Donald Sutherland is...Donald Sutherland.

One final change (for the better) is the increase of sword fighting. Another surprise for those who haven't read the book; it's packed with gun-play, but has very little sword fighting. (I believe the movie ""Captain Blood"" is what created that trope.) As with most ""Treasure Island"" movies, the lack of swordplay from the book is remedied, and it delivers.

People who haven't read the book might find this movie a bit slow and confusing. If you're only here for the pirates, then ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" may be more up your alley. But to people who are fans of the book, I highly recommend this adaptation, but be warned about a seriously wall-banger ending.",1421366400,,3550,4.947986577181208

5109071,4,B007RMQ52Q,"It's long and it's good in plot but not perfect, in that it doesn't follow the book by Robert Louis Stevenson.  The costumes are not of the period of 1750 but rather that of 1812.  In the book Squire Trelawney was not the greedy English aristocrat depicted here, who cheats Jim Hawkins out of his fair share of the treasure.  This film also turns the character of Dr. Livesey into a sniveling wimp.  Granted, he was chatty and somewhat of an idiot in the book, but nothing like he is depicted in this film.  And Ben Gunn is rendered to a hopeless lunatic beyond saving and was rightly left behind on the island.  However in the book Ben Gunn still had his wits about him, thought rationally, and actually left the island with the rest and the treasure.  In this version, Jim Hawkins throws all of the treasure overboard with Square Trelawney diving into the sea after it and to his own demise.  The key to really appreciating this film is not to have read the book or to have seen the Charlton Heston (1990) film first.

There have many versions of this in movie form and plots lifted for other books. However, get ready here it comes, none are as good as the book; that being said this comes quite close with three hours they cut out less. They added some prequel information which helps set up the movie. You can tell that this is a TV movie as with all the guns and knives there was no excess gore.

One of the DVD extras is a voice over commentary by Steve Barron the director and Eddie Izzard who played Long John.

5109080,1,B007RMQ52Q,"It grieves me deeply that the classic book has been so callously butchered by this disturbing and false film. How could anyone take such a great classic and turn it into a junk film? I wish I could be more lenient in my review but the distortion of the real storyline was simply outraging. I must advocate here for R.L. Stevenson, for as an author he must have been enraged by this brutal mutilation of his best creation. Unlike the book, here doctor Livesey and Mr. Trelawney were depicted as foes instead of friends. It was contemptible enough, but making Mr. Trelawney the avaricious villain instead of Long John Silver really upsets the viewer, not to mention the way the false villain had to die. The script was horrible. The story was not about the Admiral Benbow and not about Jim Hawkins mother; it was about the Treasure Island. Israel Hands did not die like that in the book, and the end of the film was the worst, because it was completely wrong. This film is a disgrace to anyone who read the classic. I thought, however, that the only thing which the producers got right was the choice of actors; they did their part fine in accordance with the script. Ben Gunn and his yearning for cheese matched the character in the book, just as Long John Silver did, but apart from that, this film has really disappointed me to a point of contempt. I understand that it is a norm in the film industry to distort real classics, and to change stories all the time. However, the success of a movie depends on the ethics in regard to the classic. This film was completely disrespectful to the book.",1366416000,2,1595,4.503448275862069

I've seen the 1934, 1950, and 1990 film and television versions of this story. Each takes some liberties to fit its medium, and each of those versions has merit. This version, unfortunately, doesn't pay off. I don't recommend it.",1365724800,11,738,5.049180327868853

5109087,5,B007RMQ52Q,"Stevenson's novel is an undisputed masterpiece, and his take on pirates quickly became authoritative. Likewise Long John Silver is one of the greatest characters in English literature. Many have tried to adapt the story to stage and screen, and few have succeeded. Steve Barron succeeded.

If you watch the movie you can see why a lot of people have a problem with it. It isn't a traditional take on the story. Actually, it's a truthful one. Why? In the novel and the more faithful interpretations Silver is the most nuanced character by a long shot, while other main characters like the squire, doctor and captain are no more relatable than standard action-story white hats. Rather than leave them there and retell a story we already know well enough, Barron thrusts them into a world of more sobering circumstances with imminent consequences for their every choice and exchange. Silver remains the consummate antihero (and here Izzard does him justice), but now the others are more vivid, coming to life in ways they haven't in past adaptations. The danger feels truly dangerous, and the stakes more than mere plunder, because for the first time when the doctor or the first mate enters the scene you appreciate what it's going to mean to his fortune as a human being. That's what you call a successful piece of storytelling.",1357862400,2,1327,4.897777777777778

5109089,4,B007RMQ52Q,"Like what you like or not, all this crying over changes made to Stevenson's original novel make no sense whatever. Every film ever made based upon an existing piece of work was by nature someone's interpretation of that work, not a word-for-word presentation of it. The Disney film 'Treasure Island' reflected the style & vision of its makers & was aimed toward the audiences of its time; as was the far, far superior 90s version done by the Hestons. Even screenplays written by the authors of original stories differ in parts from the book. Read Hemingway's ""To Have & Have Not"" then see the movie written by William Faulkner; other than certain character names they bear almost no resemblance, but are both masterpieces. Somebody find me a movie that matches exactly its source material (maybe 'No Country For Old Men' is the closest & the best) with no variation at all; it's nearly impossible. I agree that remakes have gotten out of hand & you can quickly count up the ones that are actually better than the original rather than just an updated re-hash but, then again, what would be the point of making a shot-for-shot, word-for-word copy of something already done? If someone were to publish a new book titled 'Treasure Island' sticking to the same basic storyline, just changing some of the particulars, that would be one thing but, this is a movie adaptation & a little fresh imagination & a new point of view is not a bad thing. As far as this film goes: When I first saw Eddie Izzard cast as Silver I thought, ""What the hell?"" & moved on along without a second look. Then I saw part of the movie on Netflix & realized how wrong I was. While not the traditional character at all, his portrayal of Long John Silver is fascinating & much fuller than most & in some ways(BLASPHEMY) I prefer him to the old version. The characters here seem more like real people than costume pieces despite the odd haircuts, etc, & may even be closer to the reality of what they represent than any even in Stevenson's book. One example being the old benevolent Squire Trelawney, so genuine & caring about the welfare of the men 'under' him. The landed gentry of the 18th century were no more like that than are the upper crust of today (politicians, corporate heads, etc), this film's makers just chose to portray that fact. Good for them.",1355270400,13,2329,4.614457831325301
5109090,2,B007RMQ52Q,"Normally I love pirate movies. I don't mind cheesy pirate films in the slightest, so even with reading some negative reviews I was truly looking forward to seeing this.

There were things I liked about it. The boy playing Jim does a good job conveying the innocence of the character - even getting some more complex screentime as Jim becomes conflicted over what the right thing to do may be.

Billy Bones gives ""Fifteen Men on a Dead Man's Chest"" a fun Caribbean flavor.

Eddie Izzard's portrayal of Long John Silver was interesting, and different. I was intrigued to see some of Silver's wife, who was actually mentioned in the book, in case you're wondering (for about one sentence, however).

There was even a magical moment that filled me with piratical glee, as the Hispaniola set sail and Long John Silver sang a good shanty. It was great, the exact flavor I'd been hoping for when I ordered the DVD. I wanted the vicarious thrill of a great sea voyage and some cutlass fights!

However.

I did not want to wind up seasick, like I would on an actual voyage. But I did. The camera cants wildly back and forth for almost the entire production (at least what I saw of it - a bit of the way into Part 2). I guess the filmmakers were trying to be edgy, to make viewers feel as if they were actually there. The shot rocks back and forth to simulate the swaying of the ship. Shaky camera filming makes me seriously nauseous and this was no exception. I wish they would release a warning label for films in this style. For half an hour after turning the movie off, I still felt like tossing my cookies over the side of a ship I hadn't set foot on.

The violence was a bit much for me, but your mileage may vary.

I wanted to like it, but I have to dock stars for being made physically ill. Sorry, Treasure Island.",1354147200,4,1812,4.356083086053412

The main part of the movie was pretty good and stayed fairly true to the book, but I was somewhat put off when Jim's mother was thrown out of her home with nothing and with nowhere to go. Then when they changed the ending into something ridiculous, that's when I blew my stack. I have read the book and I've seen other versions, and this is the worst.
#1, after almost everybody dies fighting over the treasure, the captain was going to turn the treasure in to the government as contraband? Sure, that's why they risked their lives and fortunes, to end up turning the treasure in to the government! :-p
#2, they decided to split it up between them instead, but Jim - who is going home to life of penury, throws it all overboard (what an idiot)! And the doctor helps him! :-p

5109092,4,B007RMQ52Q,"Movies about pirates are all the rage since Pirates of the Caribbean dominated the box office in the prior decade.  Some have been good, some have been bad.  Then there is this great miniseries from the SyFy channel starring various actor and actresses from both sides of the Atlantic.  Like other famous stories done up by the people at SyFy, this one is very impressive and original.  The story itself is similar to the original novel by Robert Louis Stevenson, and most of the characters in the book are present here.  But many changes were made, and for fans of the book, that might be quite disappointing.  However, for those interested in a good movie this one is quite enjoyable.  Part comedy, part action, part drama and part thriller, the movie does everything well.  The dialogue is spot on, with grammar and vocabulary matching those found in English language books from the late 1700s.  The make-up and costume design are very realistic, yet do not remind one of that found in the POTC movies.  The action scenes are good with realistic sword-fight scenes, accurate portrayals of fire-arms and fire-arm usage back then, and good but limited usage of special effects.  Even the music is good, with the sailors' songs being quite entertaining.  Overall, a great watching experience.",1351987200,5,1292,4.903225806451613

5109095,4,B007RMQ52Q,"""Treasure Island"" is one of those stories where reading the original novel beforehand is crucial to really savoring any film version, and this is especially true of this divergent adaptation. Although it retains the basic skeleton of the original plot, much has been added, and many key characters have undergone  fundamental changes. I was initially hostile to said changes but soon came to appreciate and enjoy the new sub-conflicts, many of which address universal themes (e.g., greed,loyalty) which are more relevant than ever today. I didn't particularly like the way ""TI"" (2012) hurries through pivotal scenes from the book, yet, with all that's been added, suppose that was necessary in order to limit its already 3-hour length.

This version is also full of small anachronisms in clothing and hair design, as well as some bigger ones in the ethnically diverse ship's crew (""all Englishmen!"" in the novel), some of whom sport Mr. T-style Mohawks (!?) While it seems the makers wanted to address the additional modern theme of diversity here, the un-pc truth of the matter is that your average European person of the 1700s would not have taken kindly to such a mix, and the way the crew, including its rich officers and financiers, blithely accept differences in nationality and skin-tones is, well, unconvincing. At the same time, there are also some added details (e.g., prostitutes, thieves, and hanged men along the filthy Bristol quayside) which, although avoided by Robert Louis Stevenson in a novel intended largely for a younger audience, add a great deal of realism in this version.

In the end, ""TI"" (2012) is well-filmed and well-acted despite its various weak spots. While this revision is obviously to be avoided by those rigidly attached to the original story (or just wanting to see a film version of RLS's actual book), it should appeal to audiences in search of a less dualistic, more complicated tale, created in an age that tends to appreciate anti-heroes like Long John Silver.",1349481600,4,2003,5.0636363636363635

You want to write a story? Fine. Write your own. And give it a different title.
