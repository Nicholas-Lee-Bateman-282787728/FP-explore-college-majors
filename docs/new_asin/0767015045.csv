The irony of all witchcraft trials is that from the 14th Century on, untold thousands of people were put to death by otherwise good, rational Christians because they had a skin blemish, or floated when thrown into a lake or confessed to literally anything after hours of excruciating torture. The Malleus Maleficarum, which was published in 1486 in Germany, lists a variety of seemingly benign symptoms that condemned many innocents to hanging or a fiery death.

When the 1692 witch trials commenced in Salem, Massachusetts, there was almost 300 years of prosecutorial precedence for authorities to fall back on. Testimony from a group of teenaged girls, whose courtroom behavior in hindsight appears at best staged, greatly helped in convicting 19 of Salem's citizens. Acting always in unison, the howling girls' claims of being attacked in court by the accused's spectre, apparitions that were of course only visible to the children, was all it took to send their protesting neighbors to the gallows. Ultimately, 200 people from as far south as Boston were arrested based on the group's finger-pointing.

The undoing of this coven of young accusers was their subsequent targeting of those who were, in the authorities' opinion, absolutely above reproach. Doubts were quickly raised as to the girls' veracity, resulting in the release from custody of dozens of untried people. In 1711, many previous convictions were overturned. Eventually, only one of the accusers apologized for taking part in the destruction of so many lives, for the scars inflicted upon these unfortunate souls' families and the loss of their properties.

Epilogue: The other nine ""guilty"" people had their sentences reversed in 1957 (not much consolation after being dead and buried for over 250 years!). A large marker was also placed at that time which reads: IN MEMORY OF THOSE INNOCENTS WHO DIED DURING THE SALEM VILLAGE WITCHCRAFT HYSTERIA OF 1692.

7788563,4,0767015045,"In the History Channel's ""In Search of History: The Salem Witch  Trials"", the viewer will see a wonderful distillation of a previously  footnoted slice of American History: the deaths of 20 people in Salem  Village, Massachusetts, in 1692.  Using expert commentary by historians  such as Carol Karlsen (whose book ""The Devil in the Shape of a  Woman"" is an excellent book on the entire witchcraft phenomena in New  England), the trials and individuals involved in this matter are profiled  in an understandable way.  The only minor quibble is that of all the  theories put out on what actually happened -- mostly based on the Puritans'  belief in the active participation of both good and bad spiritual forces in  everyday life -- no one mentions the theory that some scientists think  caused the whole thing: ergot, a mold found in rye.  This video is an  excellent companion to Arthur Miller's ""The Crucible"", Robin  Cook's ""Acceptable Risk"", and Matossian's ""Poisons of the  Past""(which devots space to the ergot theory). I highly recommend this  video for its visuals, its narrative, and its encapsulation of this  fascinating time in American History.",968112000,62,1156,5.0855614973262036
