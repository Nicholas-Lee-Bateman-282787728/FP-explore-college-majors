I truly wish someone would make a new film with a great ballerina playing the lead. For now this is all I have. Also buy the Keith Money biography of Pavlova. I bought one copy years ago that wasn't in great shape, but found a really nice Hardcover copy last year. She truly was the icon everybody says. I even found postcard pictures of her at Zazzle. There is also a new biography of her by Jane Pritchard available here along with the Diaghilev Ballet Russes book written by her also. There is a great book available called Apollo's Angels which I can't recommend highly enough.",1455408000,,696,4.361538461538461

7929888,3,B0000520S2,"If you're a Pavlova fan, you'll enjoy the film. If not, you'll probably want to spend your Friday night watching something else. Production values are okay. The lead doesn't dance well enough. None of problems matter if you are a Pavlova devotee. If you've read Keith Money's book, you won't find anything new in the film. Still, it's fun to see Anna celebrated in celluloid.",1249862400,4,375,4.7846153846153845
7929889,3,B0000520S2,"Despite really poor film quality and terrible dubbing, this film is nevertheless quite beautiful, visually and especially in the sentiment with which Pavlova's personal will, determination, and discipline are portrayed.

Beliaeva plays Pavlova well and dances well, bringing to life ""The Dying Swan"" and many of the ethnic dances for which Pavlova was singularly known.

The film is not great perhaps, but it is a glamorously illustrative education in the power of the human spirit to overcome personal and impersonal obstacles, which in Pavlova's case were illness and war.",1148515200,5,574,5.438202247191011
