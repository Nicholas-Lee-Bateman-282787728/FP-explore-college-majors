8152408,5,B000JMKKWW,Susan is a very good instructor. The ball was used throughout the workout. This is a great dvd I will use often.,1494115200,,112,4.136363636363637

8152411,5,B000JMKKWW,"I have been doing Susan Harris's ball workout for a whole year.  I first worked out with Susan in Firm 1 (*which I am once again doing after 12 yrs.)  It is challenging, and I always feel as if I got a great workout when I do this DVD.  My core feels stronger than ever and I love the weight workouts for upper and LOWER body).  This is a very good workout and believe me, I have ordered lots of other Firm workouts which are sitting in my entertainment center unused because they are just too dancy and fast.  Susan is hard core and I think that even at my age (now 54) I still am too.  I love the Firm workouts 1-6 and think that this one ranks up there with the rest.  I don't have much to say about the more recent ones after that.....",1233273600,4,739,3.9863945578231292
8152412,5,B000JMKKWW,"I really enjoyed this video for a good core workout.  Susan really can work you with that exercise ball.  There are some tricky balance moves with the ball, but practice makes perfect.  Plus, that's part of getting your core into shape - being able to hold yourself and balance.  She always stretches you out good after each long set of exercises too.  I appreciate that.  I usually couple this video with a shortened aerobic exercise video for the full workout routine.  I recommend this.",1229817600,,489,4.75
8152413,5,B000JMKKWW,"Firm believers, if you've wondered where Susan Harris went, here she is!  From beginning to end, she has that calm confidence that I don't think anyone can object to.  She is straight down to business.  This all strength workout doesn't only focus on the abs, as you might think.  Thankfully, she doesn't rely solely on a plethora of crunches to engage your core, either (although she does use some).  Instead she employs balance or some contraction during exercises for other muscle groups.  When I finish this workout, I feel like I've hit all my muscle groups, and I like that I'm mentally engaged the whole time because Susan leads you through exercises that are innovative and very effective.  This DVD has found a space in my regular rotation.",1219104000,6,749,4.8046875
8152414,5,B000JMKKWW,"Finding Your Core is one of four new functional fitness workouts from the Tracie Long Training (TLT) group. The concept of functional fitness means that the exercises are designed to mimic the movements you perform in ""real"" life, often by emphasizing balance and other core-strengthening moves. In Finding Your Core, a stability ball is used (along with several sets of weights), which serves to challenge both your core and your balance during every exercise. This makes for a workout that is unique, varied, challenging, and fun all at the same time. The instructor is Susan Harris, from Firm Volume 1 fame--you would never believe that it's 20 years and several children later! As with all of the TLT workouts, Susan works out with two companions, Lauren, who is showing modified versions of the exercises, and Ann, who does some more challenging moves.

Susan begins the workout with s 6-minute warmup using the stability ball. I found her a bit difficult to follow here, as she quickly moves the ball overhead and side-to-side without always noting directional changes in advance. The warmup also includes dips, knee lifts, and a very nice segment of dynamic stretches using the ball. The first strength exercise involves sitting on the ball holding weights and not quite lifting of the ball in a squat while doing tricep kickbacks; Susan then adds in the first of many great shoulder/back exercises with a scaption pinch. Moving to lying on the ball in a bridge position, you'll do a pelvic tuck--be sure to follow Susan's great form pointers here!--a chest press, both moves together, and then leg lifts.

Coming back to a standing position, you'll squeeze the ball between your calves, you'll work your upper body by pressing your arms out to the corners of the room with a torso rotation. Next comes a series of shoulder/back work that I loved: first you'll do a 1-arm row, then you'll lie pelvis-down on the ball for a unique shoulder rotation/sweep move. Transitioning to lying sideways over the ball, you'll first work your hips wiht some leg lifts/knee ins, then work your obliques with side crunches (I found it difficult to find a good position here, as my ball kept sliding around). Going back to the upper body, you'll do push-ups with your thighs resting on the ball and then a row/triceps kickbacks series with your chest on the ball. Again returning to standing, Susan leads you through another unique shoulder move: you rest one hand on the ball and move the other arm straight out, up, and back, rotating the thumb up. Resting your shoulders on the ball, you do more upper body work with triceps extensions and lat pullovers. Then, resting your weights on your hips, you'll do some glute presses (again, listen to Susan's form tips!) before completing the side-lying series on the opposite side.

Next comes a rather tricky move: standing with one toe balanced on the ball at your side, you'll push that leg out while doing a 1-leg squat in the standing leg. You have to follow Susan's instructions carefully here, but if you push the ball slightly forward as she suggests, you shouldn't have any problems with this move, and you'll really feel it in your glutes; Susan eventually adds in an overhead press. Next, you'll lie with your lower back on the ball for some transverse abdominal crunches--again, I found Susan's form pointers to be extremely helpful. You'll also do some upper body work with bicep curls and passing a weight from side-to-side. After completing another set of crunches, you'll finish with the 1-legged squat series on the other side.

For the final standing series, you'll again hold the ball between your calves for some postural work (a move that Tracie called an ""A-frame"" in her previous series of TLP workouts). Additional shoulder/back work comes in the form of front and side raises here. Next, you'll do some targeted core work by kneeling, resting your hands on the ball, and rolling out to an elbow plank position. Then, rolling forward so that your forearms are on the floor, you'll work your glutes with leg lifts, leg flutters, and in-and-out beats. Moving to lying on your back, you'll place your heels on the ball, roll up into a bridge position, and then roll the ball in and out to work your hamstrings. Although this is basically a simple move, coming this late in the workout--you may not realize it, but your legs are already quite fatigued--made it extremely challenging, especially when Susan keeps the legs rolled in for a heel-toe variation. After this tough work comes a well-deserved 6-minute stretch. Staying in a lying position and resting your calves on the ball, you'll begin with a simple twist, then stretch both the hamstrings and the IT band. Sitting on the ball, you'll do a seated twist and a seated forward bend, and then Susan finishes with some nice lat and side stretches, bringing the total workout time in at 49 minutes.

Overall, I enjoyed this workout very much, especially all of the wonderful, unique shoulder work. Sometimes I find using a stability ball frustrating, as I'm unable to get my form quite right, but with only one minor exception (noted above), I thought Susan gave really excellent tips here which allowed me to make adjustments which served to improve my form. Out of the 4 TLT workouts, I think that FYC is probably the easiest, and yet it was still quite challenging--not to mention fun, too! My only (small) complaint was that the music was often so low as to be practically inaudible. Also, there is no chapter menu, but the workout IS chaptered, so you can use your skip button to move around if necessary. I would definitely recommend this workout to intermediate level and above exercisers who are looking to incorporate some fun yet challengnig functional fitness work into their routines.",1170288000,25,5808,4.868554095045501
