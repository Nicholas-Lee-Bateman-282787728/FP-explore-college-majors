8159848,5,B000L22VQS,"I bought this DVD for my daughter who starting playing lacrosse this summer.  The instruction provided by Coach Levy was extremely helpful.  She broke down the basics of passing, catching, ground balls, shooting and dodging in a manner that was easy to understand (for both myself and my daughter).  The drills that follow the skill instruction are also very helpful because they reinforce the techniques that taught by Coach Levy.  All and all, a very excellent learning tool!",1190937600,3,477,5.076923076923077
8159849,1,B000L22VQS,"Not enough instruction or practical information.  Identified cradling as the most important skill, then neglected to show details on hand position, wrist movement or arm movement.  Spent too little time with details.  DVD should have been at least twice as long as the meager 32 minutes on this DVD.

This was an embarressment to girls lacrosse.",1185148800,7,345,5.107142857142857
8159850,5,B000L22VQS,"I am typical 30 something father who doesn't know a thing about girl's lacrosse (I was a high school baseball player). This makes me a rare species living on Long Island where lacrosse is king. My daughter has caught the lacrosse bug so I purchased this DVD on Amazon so she can reinforce the skills she is learning in her practices.

The DVD has an excellent production value and I appreciated the manner in which Coach Levy explained the various drills. This DVD helped explain the different skills a beginning player must master and helped explain why the skills are important to playing the game.

Great job with the DVD Coach. If people like me were your target, you hit the bull's eye.",1174867200,9,691,4.609756097560975
