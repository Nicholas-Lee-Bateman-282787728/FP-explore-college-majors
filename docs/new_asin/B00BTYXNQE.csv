5673419,3,B00BTYXNQE,"Prophecy is a better than average monster movie featuring the great northeast, forest practices, native Americans, and modern medicine.  Prophecy is a good example of how pollution can have harmful, even catastrophic effects on a the environment.  But a mutant creature spread over the evolutionary scale because of a mutagen is hard to believe.  Even the creature when he emerges out  of the woods doesn't have these qualities but more resembles a huge half burned bear.  Talia Shire is likeable but has a weak part dragging around her cello.while pregnant.  She fears damage to her child but we get no clue what happens to her baby.  There is little romance between her and the Dr.  This movie needs more passion, more feeling, higher emotion, and above all more fear, Much more fear.  This is a horrible thing that is hunting them.  Incidentally the good Dr. doesn't have a clue how to bring in a good sized trout.  Anyone who fishes, particularly a native American knows an in stream net usually called a gill net catches upstream migrants not downstream moving fish or baby creatures.  This movie could be good with more attention to detail",1391990400,2,1145,4.845360824742268

5673424,3,B00BTYXNQE,"This is a fairly decent B movie, although very dated with its 70s tropes of idealistic young environmentalists trying to save Indian tribes of Maine. The disc doesn't up-convert very well, so it isn't as dazzling as more recent movies. I think the monster might have looked more terrifying in theaters. Sissy's Wholesale did do a very good job of getting the disc to me in good shape in a timely manner.",1476057600,,403,4.611111111111111
5673425,4,B00BTYXNQE,I remember this movie when I was a teenager. Now that I'm almost 50 I still think its a freaking scary movie. The story makes you think it could really happen as well,1473811200,,166,4.0606060606060606

Movie is pretty bad, but maybe in a good kind of way.  Monster wasn't as monstrous as I remembered, but the movie is a fun 90 minutes and worth a look.",1469750400,,285,4.071428571428571

5673430,5,B00BTYXNQE,My parents wouldn't let me see it when it came out so now I can see it anytime I want. The special effects of this time and a few years before and after are definitely a pivotal point in film history. Could and will watch this movie for years to come.,1469404800,,251,3.9411764705882355
5673431,5,B00BTYXNQE,Great DVD transfer that scales to blu-ray play on HDTV ''s well.  You have to see the sleeping bag scene.  Wife could not stop laughing.  Anyway great popcorn movie.,1469145600,,165,4.620689655172414

5673438,5,B00BTYXNQE,"I was able to see this in the theaters. Just the mention of a monster movie as a kid and you want to watch it. Some may think it's campy, but that's okay. Its a nature gone wild with revenge. I liked it very much",1446076800,,212,3.7333333333333334
5673439,5,B00BTYXNQE,We have been trying to find this movie for a long time. Great find!!!,1445904000,,69,4.0
5673440,5,B00BTYXNQE,"This is a damn scary movie with a strong environmental message and a big, mutated beastie, an amalgum of all creatures found in nature, that is truly hideous.  Its muscles, sinews and puss on the outside of its body!  It's also ravenous, not to mention pissed off (wouldn't you be, if you were born disfigured like that?).  This really merits a high-definition transfer and release on blu-ray!",1445558400,,393,4.835820895522388

5673443,3,B00BTYXNQE,"John Frankenheimer's 'Prophecy' is a film that doesn't get near the credit it deserves form genre fans. The film stars a great late 70's cast that includes Robert Foxworth, Talia Shire (filmed the same time as Rocky II), Richard Dysart, and Armand Assante. Stylishly directed by Frankenheimer who is responsible for other great films like 'The Manchurian Candidate', 'The French-Connection II', 'Black Sunday', and 'Ronin' among others, and written by David Seltzer who is also responsible for the scripts for films such as 'The Omen', 'Lucas', and 'Punch Line'. The film takes the popular late 70's/early 80's subject of pollution/nature tampering creating mutated beings and weaves a very interesting story with a  subject matter based off a true case in 1958 when mercury from a chemical plant outside a Japanese city was being dumped into a local river and was said to have mutated some of the villagers living downstream of it.

'Prophecy' is a typical ""monster movie"" of man vs. nature. Although the creature of the story, the Native American spirit known as katahdin, was not created from nature, but rather mutated by toxic chemicals from a local mill, it still follows a basic storyline and doesn't veer much from the path. What I liked most about this film was how straight-forward it was. It didn't get lost in itself trying to one-up ever twist and turn and managed to generate some legitimate scares as well as weave a pretty interesting tale. What is best about this film though is the acting. It is helped along by a superb cast of character actors who portray their particular characters perfectly.

This is definitely a must see for fans of the genre and is something I have added proudly to my horror film collection.",1442188800,4,1735,4.914675767918089

5673453,4,B00BTYXNQE,"This was one of the strange ""monster"" movies I remember growing up as a kid in the '70s. We had some doozies in that decade as well and most had a theme going for them, this one is no exception. I want to call it ""the animal gone crazy"" theme because that is exactly what it is. It has a message to send as well to the viewer. Mess up the environment and the animals will wreak havoc!  A large company runs a paper mill near pristine forest land. Ripe for logging and lumberjacks. The Native American Indians living nearby say it is having adverse affects on their lives and community. Severe health defects. The EPA is notified and two members show up. Robert Foxworth and Talia Shire (Rocky). What they discover after visiting the paper mill is that liquid mercury is being put in the ground, contaminating everything it comes in contact with, including fish, raccoon, and bear. Soon, the Indians living in the village and the members of the EPA, realize they are being stalked by something large, and something angry. It seems no place is safe and they have to get out of the forest as soon as they can with their very lives!

This ""updated"" 2013 DVD edition is bare bones with only the movie itself. Although the movie is good and the picture is good for DVD standards and sound, it's just the movie, folks. If you are looking for it cheap, look around your local video stores where DVDs are sold. You may get a really good deal like me. I paid only 4 bucks. 4 stars for the movie because I like it and the message, and 2 stars for the DVD because Paramount, you could have done better on this!! I hope in the future you give us a really good Blu-ray edition with lots of features! You are one of the better Blu-ray companies out there in my opinion.",1423958400,8,1754,4.344512195121951
5673454,3,B00BTYXNQE,"Very good service from the seller.  The movie is a fair attempt at a warning about the effects of pollution but falls short IMHO.  The actors give it a good try though, working with a overwrought story.  As a sci-fi monster movie it does have a few moments.  Not one of Mr. Frankenheimer's best but it's fair.",1420243200,,309,4.368421052631579
5673455,5,B00BTYXNQE,Not a bad film but either way it came in the expected time and the quality is good,1414368000,,82,3.611111111111111

5673458,5,B00BTYXNQE,This is the most memorable sci-fi film I have watched. Takes place in the '80s but it is well acted and gives you something to think about.,1404777600,,139,4.185185185185185
5673459,5,B00BTYXNQE,"This is a great horror flik, that could be a reality... What if ... something like, a chemical spill got into our waterways and the fish eat it, then everything else eat the fish and the chemical had a deforming agent in it and whatever/whoever ingested it got sick from it, and females, animal or human, expecting babies gave birth to little monsters......",1392163200,,357,4.682539682539683

8573834,5,B00BTYXNQE,"This is a good, old fashioned monster flick. Simple, effective, and has a great backdrop of the Maine forests in which a mutated bear goes on the attack. Horror / thriller movies today can sometimes be too confusing, who wants to sit there for two hours and wonder who dunnit when obviously who dunnit here is a 12 foot tall mutated bear! In all seriousness, this won't win any awards for special effects but the acting is solid, and the story-line runs along with the humans hurting the environment theme. Bit of nostalgia, but I really like it.",1490659200,,546,4.581632653061225

8573838,4,B00BTYXNQE,"I remember when it came out. Enjoyed it then, and even now though the story line is a bit over the top. Nevertheless, for a sci fi film, it is still worth watching again.",1480636800,,170,4.029411764705882

I'm also looking for ""Rage of the Yeti,"" but have a feeling they never made it into a DVD...can't figure out why.  There are some really lame movies that have been made into DVDs, but not this one.  I think it is a great adventure story.  If you ever see that it's been made into a DVD, let me know.
