8707162,4,B00UK6NT3Y,"This is another one of the import DVDs (which are coded region 0 to play in all countries ) consisting of performance clips taken from TV shows. Though the packaging info leaves a lot to  be desired, and this DVD  featuring singer songwriter Tom T. Hall is a bit short on length (its just 27 minutes long), its actually quite good  if you are a Hall fan.  Hall didn't appear on TV much and  unless Im mistaken  this is the first DVD of his performances.

There are 8 performances here  starting with Hall playing banjo while backing a very young Emmy Lou Harris from a country TV show probably from early 1980s. Four of the performances (with Hall playing guitar or just singing are from the Live at Church Street Station cable series from circa 1983. There is one performance (What Have You Got To Lose) from Hee Haw and another from a live outside music festival  also probably the 1980s.

Of the eight performances, TWO are of Old Dogs, Children, and Watermelon Wine. (By the way, the track list on back  which is not correct) lists that song as three separate songs: Old Dogs, Children, and Watermelon Wine.  And the song titled Paradise on the package is really Muhlenberg Country The last clip is from Ralph Emerys cable TV show Pop Goes The Country) and features Hall singing (very loosely) and playing back up with Johnny Rodriquez for the song that that co-wrote You Always Come Back to Hurting Me. This is the only clip where the sound is distorted. All the other clips have decent image and sound and presented in either 4:3 or 1:33-1 aspect ratio.

Most are Hall-penned songs, though he does perform John Prines Paradise (also known as Muhlenberg County)

So, unless you are a Hall fan, I cant say you need this, but if you are, you might find this budget priced DVD worth checking out. My four star rating is for the performances, not the packaging.

Note: The DVD will not be released until June 9th but I received an advance copy from the distributor for objective review.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
