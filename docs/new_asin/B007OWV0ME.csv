I highly recommend buying it versus renting it, you're going to want this in your dvd collection! ;)",1383696000,,256,4.244897959183674
8519963,5,B007OWV0ME,"The story of two hit men who have been friends for years.  Now, one wants out of the business.  Watch the action unfold as the bullets start to fly.

Revenge movies are always great entertainment.  Most want the good guy to triumph and the bad to fall.  This will keep your interest as you follow the hit men and those they come in contact with.  There is a bit of humor mixed in where you will be sure to crack a smile.  Karaoke, anyone?",1382745600,,438,4.142857142857143
