4044121,5,B0030CRK4E,"this is a great set! some have complained about the packaging...i got my set a couple years ago and the packaging is great. very high quality and durable. maybe some changes have been made ??
inside the box you will find three seperate folders full of dvds. this organizes them by year. although not all of her movies are available in this set (the prince and the showgirl, for one) it is still wonderful. you get a large variety (17 movies in all!) so there is something for everyone. many of these movies i had never seen until i got this set and some of them are now my most favorite of all time - even the ones where marilyn does not have a major role are great. whether you love marilyn or just love old movies this set is perfect for you. i love marilyn monroe and treasure this set!!!",1347321600,3,791,4.245033112582782
4044122,5,B0030CRK4E,"Incredible ""collection sets"" like this fantastic Marilyn Monroe set truly make it worth still buying, collecting and owning DVDs.  This is just a jaw-dropping set at such a low price.  You get 17 Marilyn movies on 17 individual disks for less than $50--that's like $3 per movie.  And in buying this one set you get to own practically all of Marilyn's most wonderful movies, all the best movies of the hands-down most iconic female movie star in all of movie history.  Other reviewers have listed all 17 movies you get in the set, so I won't repeat that information.  I'll just point out that the only 2 majorly significant Marilyn movies NOT included in the set are: River Of No Return (1954) and The Prince And The Showgirl (1957).  There are also about 10 other films that Marilyn had cameos or small parts in that are not included in the set either.  But overall, in this incredible set, you get 17 of her most famous movies, the vast majority of her biggest films.  For lovers of classic movies and classic movie stars, this is a set that's just too good not to own.  Highly, highly recommend this one.

PS: Other reviewers have noted the ""unique"" packaging.  It is somewhat of an odd design, made to house 17 disks in a very compact packaging format.  Though it may not be the most ideal packaging or greatest design, I think it can be considered a minor drawback and overlooked considering the set's incredible movies and great price.  Also, just want to note that I ordered this through Amazon, got the free shipping, and had the set within 3 days of ordering.  So hats off to Amazon again for their speedy shipping and quality service.",1345852800,27,1643,4.582191780821918
4044123,5,B0030CRK4E,"I've seen a lot of gripes about the packaging, and it really is terrible; cheap paperboard cases with simple slots to hold the disks in place. Add in the usual mistreatment packages suffer traveling through the USPS and you get shipping anarchy. In sets 1 and 2, Don't Bother to Knock and Niagara were free-floating and visibly scratched, and go figure, these are two of the movies I've been dying to see in restored versions (in fact EVERY disk seems scratched to some degree, and adorned with little flecks of paper and dust, incredible but true). You may want to check all of the disks by FF through them (as I am doing now - if The Seven Year Itch had been unplayable I would have been quite irate). Fortunately I had no problems with the disks, as I FF through them and didn't see any odd pauses or jumps. I've attached a photo of set 1 to show how lame that packaging is. As for the movies, I grew up seeing choppy old prints of Niagara on TV, and this restored version looks incredible - likewise DBTK. The Seven Year Itch and Bus Stop almost look like different movies compared to the old pan-and-scan versions of my youth. I can only imagine what blu-ray versions would look like. So be warned, the actual movies look and sound great, the artwork on both packaging and disks is very cute, but those paper slots, man, WTFWTT? One last note, Fox kind of boned us by NOT including River of No Return in this set, and it's probably NOT a coincidence that they just released it on blu-ray, but Marilyn fans simply cannot find a better deal when it comes to value for your money.",1344556800,125,1582,4.402730375426621
4044124,5,B0030CRK4E,"This is one great box set of Marilyn's films (17 in this set) on 17 single DVDs. It's also awesome you get all these movies from Fox (not public domain) for under fifty bucks!! There are just a few special features on the movies, but I want the Monroe movies to watch. Looks as if these are older transfers, but still look good for DVD. This is ""The Premiere Collection"" so don't expect Marilyn Monroe film school 101. These movies are great by themselves without a bunch of special features to dig through. My only complaint is the way Fox houses the discs. Could have been better, but hey I have never seen a 17 disc set so thin!! This could have been a monster of a box set. Glad it sits well on my shelves. This is NOT a complete collection of her films. There are several missing (including River of No Return) that should have been included in this set. Wonder why Fox didn't take the time and money to remaster each film? I have MANY collections on DVD and I find this set one of the most enjoyable! Now, where is the blu ray 17 disc set? Now, THAT would be a treasure!!",1344384000,25,1077,4.233009708737864
4044125,5,B0030CRK4E,"The info on Amazon is limited, so let me fill you in.  There are seventeen disks... one per movie.  The disks are grouped in a sort of jacket according to their release date.  Their are three jackets (?) (Volume One(1950-2), Volume Two(1952-3), and Volume Three(1954-61).  Each unfolds to reveal a picture of Marilyn on the back and the CDs for the set on the inside.  The front of each volume is laid out much like a magazine with the movie names as headlines and a brief catch (""Getting your foot in the door"",""Tricks to looking younger"", etc.), which I found quite cute.  The back of the actual box shows all of the movies, their volumes, and brief summaries.  As for the movies, there are 10 B&W and 7 Color movies.  Here they are:

Volume One: 1950-1952:
All About Eve (B&W)
As Young As You Feel(B&W)
Lets Make It Legal(B&W)
Love Nest(B&W)
Don't Bother To Knock(B&W)

Volume Two: 1952-1953
Monkey Business(B&W)
O. Henry's Full House(B&W)
We're Not Married(B&W)
Gentlemen Prefer Blondes(Color)
How To Marry A Millionaire(Color)
Niagara(Color)

Volume Three: 1954-1961
There's No Business Like Show Business(Color)
The Seven Year Itch(Color)
Bus Stop(Color)
Some Like It Hot(B&W)
Let's Make Love(Color)
The Misfits(B&W)

As for the packaging, I wasn't too pleased.  I love the layouts, summaries, headlines, etc. but it's like thick paper and I can tell it's easily ripped, damaged, etc.  I ripped a tiny bit of the packaging while taking out one of the DVDs!  However, I plan on taking good care of it anyway and it's a wonderful set.

Overall, yes, I would recommend this to any Marilyn fan looking for a great, quality set.",1344038400,413,1629,4.869090909090909

4044130,3,B0030CRK4E,"I really hate to give this 3 stars, but the packaging is a fail of epic proportions. This is without a doubt a 5 star collection in a 1 star package. When this arrived on my door (brand new from Amazon) almost every single disc had came loose and had sustained damage. Not enough to ruin the discs, but enough to no longer be considered ""new"". Anybody who says this is a manageable slipcase is lying. While I of course don't prefer slipcases, sets like Friday The 13th, Star Wars and Alien keep and hold the discs just fine. The space for the discs to rest in this set is very shallow and taut, so there's not much to hold it in and when you do have a disc that is snug, it will be scratched on the way out. They are also stacked on top of each other... just look at the photos and you will see how bad the disc sleeves are.

It's really a shame because aside from the extremely poor disc sleeves, this packaging is looks gorgeous! The three cases are glossy and feature mock magazine covers that have hilarious descriptions for the movies that also make fun of women's magazine headlines and they feature great centerfold photos. I would LOVE to proudly have this on my shelf but I had to get three plastic 6-disc dvd holders so I could keep them in good condition. And I recommend you do the same, at least the case is clever enough to keep just as an art piece.

Fact is, this is the best Monroe collection for the best price. It features both supporting and starring role films and anybody thinking about buying a Monroe shirt or poster needs to get this first!

4044136,4,B0030CRK4E,"You cant beat this collection of 17 videos for the $30 it costbut Its not exactly a collection of films starring MM until mid-way through the pack with the best of them, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.  Surprisingly, almost all of the earlier films are quite good: well written, acted and directed, but MM has only a walk-on or tiny cameo in the better known ones like All About Eve, or O. Henry's Full House where she makes a glancing appearance as a prostitute in one of half-a-dozen O. Henry short stories adapted for the big screen.

You wait with eager anticipation for MM to take on the starring role but quite a few of the comedic or dramatic films are big disappointments, especially The Seven Year Itch and Bus Stop.  The contrived plot and the entirely unsympathetic and unbelievable co-star of Itch wastes Marilyns otherwise good performance and Bus Stop suffers from the tedium and disaffection of so many of playwright William Inges characters.  Her comedic talents are apparent throughout, but movies like Dont Bother to Knock and Niagara give a sense of her genuine dramatic range and talent.  By far the best films are the musicals like Gentlemen, Theres No Business Like Show Business, and Lets Make Love, which sweep you into another world.  Theres a show-stopper in Gentlemen where co-star Rosalind Russell, who is pretending in a French court to be MMs character to save her from grief she could not save herself from, bursts into both a song-and-dance rendition of Diamonds Are A Girls Best Friend that youll never forget and thats worth the price of the whole collection.",1497398400,2,1587,4.837638376383764

There are some movies in this collection I've never heard of. I will probably never get the time to watch them. But I do enjoy my favorites: ""Gentleman Prefer Blonds"", ""How to Marry a Millionaire"", ""Seven Year Itch"", and ""Niagra"". I've seen others but they are not on my list of to-see movies for any reason: ""Misfits"", ""Don't Bother to Knock"", ""Bus Stop"", and ""The Misfits"". But I finally saw ""Some Like It Hot"". I have seen scenes from this movie but men dressed as women just makes my skin crawl. And I've always found the scenes of those two men dressed as women in this particular movie, well, creepy. I powered through it. Saw it to the end. It was OK. But too contrived for my tastes. Also, I don't know why ""All About Eve"" is in a Marilyn Monroe collection. She was only in a bit part of that movie. Why not throw in some commercials if she did some, or some news clips too if that is the criteria for inclusion.",1479168000,,1090,4.195238095238095

4044149,5,B0030CRK4E,"I feel that this is by far the best collection of Marilyn Monroe films out there! 17 Films on 17 DVD's that does a great job of covering her career from start to finish! Many of the films are some of her biggest  Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, How To Marry A Millionaire, Some Like it Hot, All About Eve , Bus Stop, Seven Year Itch and some that I consider to be underrated gems Niagara, Don't Bother To Knock etc! Would have been nice if the collection contained River of No Return, the Prince And The Show Girl and Clash By Night but I am not going to complain being that this collection is priced at a bargain! I actually got the set in brand new condition for only $25 but even at $39.99 it is still a steal!

I am puzzled at to some of the negative comments regarding the packaging! I actually prefer the cardboard packaging to the plastic cases! The packaging is environmentally friendly and the photos they used are some of her best! I know some people complained about ""damaged"" disc. I guess I was lucky because I viewed all 17 disc and every disc was perfect!

4044163,5,B0030CRK4E,"I really enjoy(ed) this collection of Marilyn Monroe's array of movies.  While the first few movies she has bit roles, she still has quite the presence and pizazz in her delivery, and leaves an impact.  I found I liked her more dramatic roles better vs. her comedic roles (though those were delightful).  I had not seen her in more serious roles before (Don't Bother To Knock, Niagara, Bus Stop).  Her versatility impressed me...in fact even haunted me they way she seemed so vulnerable in those roles.  If I had any complaint about this set at all, it is not any of the movie content, but rather the annoying anti-piracy PSAs that begin a few of the discs.  It has heavy rock music that is not in keeping with the tone of Marilyn's era of movies -- plus, I'm sitting here watching DVDs I actually purchased, so is this PSA even necessary??  Bad call in having those on there.  The packaging I actually like.  While it is true in shipping a few of the discs came loose, I was lucky that none were damaged, and in now sitting at home on a shelf they should remain secure.  The slots are easier to deal with than clicking them into snap holders through the disc holes...which tend to break and make you worry you're going to bend the discs.  One other surprise was the inclusion of the entire O Henry Full House disc, which, although Marilyn only has a brief appearance in one of the sketches...the rest of the stories are very enjoyable to watch, as well as the O Henry special features.

Be warned that about 6 or 7 of the discs are movies in which Marilyn has a bit role, and therefore very little screen time. As a lot of people have mentioned, the packaging is pretty flimsy, and doesn't protect the discs well. I wouldn't have given a reduced review for those reasons alone, but for the fact that at least one of the discs has a bad defect (and one with Marilyn in a starring role, no less)--Let's Make Love has an audio problem where for about half the movie, the audio drops to almost inaudible levels. As wasn't able to watch all of these within the return timeframe, I discovered it too late.

Of all the beautiful actresses (actors) that graced the silver screen in my day (Im 71 years old) Marilyn is the only one I wish I could have met and spent time with.  If you read her book (Marilyn, Her Life in Her Own Words), also available here on Amazon, and research some of the vast amount of material surrounding her life and rise to fame and then her tragic death (not a suicide), you'll understand why I make that statementperhaps. Keep this in mind, she was one of only two actors that attended the acclaimed ""Actors Studio"" who were considered by its renowned founders/educators (Elia Kazan, Cheryl Crawford, Robert Lewis and Lee Strasberg) to be the most capable, talented, intelligent and dedicated film artists...the other was Marlon Brando!",1423785600,,886,4.9

4044200,5,B0030CRK4E,"So far, I just got it yesterday, I have only watched one of the films, ""As Young As You Feel"" , which was delightful and the picture was perfect, so I don't know if any of my discs skip or any of the other issues I read others complain about, but they look good. When I ordered this, just a few days ago, it must have been on special, because I paid $29.99, so 17 films is a steal! $1.76  per film! For that, I do not mind that cardboard packaging. I can always keep my discs in better sleeves. I see that now, Amazon lists it at $44.85 ($2.62ish each) which is still an amazing price, so forget the packaging!
In some of these films Marilyn has small roles. Like ""All About Eve"", Marilyn is a scene stealing walk-on, in only one scene, but it is a fantastic film! So is ""As Young As You Feel"", where she has a small part as the mean boss's secretary, but if you are a fan, you will want to see them all! Whether she is the unfaithful, scheming wife of depressed Joseph Cotton, in ""Niagra"" or she is keeping cool by putting her panties in the freezer, she is and always will be one of the most captivating creatures to ever grace the silver screen.
The only slightly negative I can make about this set is that it does not include ""Point of No Return"", which it really should... but since I only paid $1.76 for each of these films, I can spring for that one separately!",1419379200,3,1368,4.142857142857143

4044207,4,B0030CRK4E,"This is now THE Marilyn Monroe collection to own, as it combines most of versions I and II of the previous ""Diamond Collection"" and maintains their visual restoration and enchancement as well.  It is as complete a one-box collection I know of, but nonetheless it lacks a number of Marilyn's bit parts in movies when her career was just underway, a low-billed but noticeable performance in the highly-regarded Noir THE ASPHALT JUNGLE (1950); a starring role in the adventure movie RIVER OF NO RETURN (1954) opposite Robert Mitchum;  a co-starring role vis-a-vis Laurence Olivier in THE PRINCE AND THE SHOWGIRL (U.K., 1957); and, sadly, the skeleton of the comedy SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE, which ceased production when Marilyn died in 1962.  Even her relatively small roles in Fox's build-up phase are evident in films like LOVE NEST and LET'S MAKE IT LEGAL; of those, my favorite is her ""chapter"" vis-a-vis David Wayne in the multi-story WE'RE NOT MARRIED.  Packaging and bells-and-whistles are minimal, but the quality is up there in the films themselves, and at a very good price.

I also enjoy the acting of her costars, and the look at that bygone era -- the clothing, automobiles, lifestyles, etc.  The reproductions are gorgeous -- color and film quality outstanding.",1384905600,,442,5.097222222222222

4044233,2,B0030CRK4E,"The only positive things I have to say about this set is that the general appearance and layout is cute, and that it's about time someone put all of Marilyn's movies into one set at an affordable price. And now for the ugly negatives... When I opened the package for the first time, the box had already been bent/crushed along the edges. No big deal. But then when I opened the sleeves that contain the DVDs, they literally just fell out into my lap. They were not securely placed inside the sleeves, which caused about 9 out of 17 discs to be quite scratched up. I tried watching a few of the movies anyways, and without surprise, the scratches caused from the poor box quality ended up making some of those movies skip while playing. This was rather upsetting to me. I will now have to spend the money to resurface the DVDs in order to be able to watch them. Quite disappointed.",1380067200,3,880,4.404907975460123

4044244,3,B0030CRK4E,"First off, I am the biggest Marilyn fan there is, so this is not a knock on the movies. In even the ones where Marilyn has small roles, the films are still interesting. Not only is she gorgeous, she has great comic timing and was a very under-rated actress. The problem is that half the discs in the collection are unplayable, or have defects of some sort. I have had to return this set three times already and here are my experiences:

All About Eve (won't load)
As Young As You Feel (skips, freezes, ultimately becomes unreadable)
Let's Make It Legal (fine)
Love Nest (fine but Marilyn is barely in it)

Monkey Business (skips, freezes, eventually stops playing)
O. Henry's Full House (fine, but Marilyn is in one scene)
We're Not Married (skips, freezes, eventually stops playing)
Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (plays almost fine, slight skipping towards the end)
How to Marry a Millionaire (skips, freezes, you get the idea)
Niagara (won't load)

At this point, since I was watching the films in chronological order, I stopped watching and just returned the sets. I could have worked around the problems if Niagra and How to Marry a Millionaire played fine, but when they started to have problems, too..!

The problem is twofold, first, the pressing of the discs isn't the greatest, causing the defects. Second, as already mentioned, the discs come loose during the shipping process and always arrived scratched. I have heard people knock the Charlie's Angels complete set with its spindles, well, I will take that over this set anytime. That set had twenty-seven discs and each one of them worked. This one I can't even get through half the collection without finding a half a dozen defects. Amazon suspects its my player, yeah, right! I have tried it on multiple players, each time with similar results. Don't buy this set unless you have a lot of patience and are prepared for lots of disappointment.

UPDATE:  I picked up a fourth copy of this edition from Target and guess what? No defects at all and I am through nearly the entire collection, so it must have something partly to do with the rough handling in the Amazon warehouses or the product they have stocked there. The movies are great, Marilyn looks beautiful in all the restored versions. My advice, though, would be that if you buy this set (especially from Amazon), watch it quickly in case you might need to make a return as the quality of the discs is certainly a crapshoot.",1371427200,46,2441,4.745283018867925
4044245,5,B0030CRK4E,I am studying acting and I have always adored the incredible charm Marilyn had. I saw every single one of the movies and it is great because you see her doing small roles at the beginning to finally making entire movies about her. I carefully studied all of her gestures and acting skills and I had a blast. A lot of learning for aspiring actresses who better to learn from but the queen!,1370736000,,388,4.328767123287672

There were about 5-6 DVD's loose in the box due to the packaging when I received it. which resulted in some scratches on them.

One of those, one required me to unplug the Blu-ray player, as it totally locked it up (no fun as my power connector is mounted to the back of my console and requires moving the large flat-screen TV and stretching upside-down and feeling (cant see it) the plug). The movies (and partials) I was able to watch were a good rendering, and the number of movies for the price was right. I don't know if it was my player (although I haven't had any other movies behave thus), but Amazon quickly refunded my money and emailed me a return shipping label.",1367366400,4,710,4.3059701492537314

My set had no scratches and all movies played great. Some early movies don't have much Marilyn. But, she still lights up the screen and steals the show whether she has one line (O Henry's 'Full House'), minor role ('All About Eve', 'Love Nest', etc.),or is the star ('Niagara', 'Seven Year Itch', 'Bus Stop', 'Some Like it Hot', etc.) and this set is missing some important movies ('The Asphalt Jungle', 'Clash By Night', 'River of No Return', 'Prince and The Showgirl'), but all in all a great deal.",1366329600,2,695,4.8

4044263,5,B0030CRK4E,"Yes, it's got Cheesy/Cheap packaging. This collection deserves a much better box. When the set arrived a couple of the discs were sliding around inside the box due to the poor design. The outer box is okay, but, the inner sleeves are not a very secure
way to store the discs.

With all that being said, I will admit that this is one of the most complete sets of ""Marilyn Monroe"" works available. It's discs are
well  made and there are no issues with playability. The transfers to DVD are complete and good quality. I only have a couple of
holes to fill now to make my collection of Marilyn Complete.

These are her most 'important' works and the ones that she is well remembered for including ""7 Year Itch"", ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"", ""Some Like It Hot"" and even when she had smaller parts she was dazzling in them like her role in ""All About Eve"" that really was what brought her to the forefront.

After watching the collection, you will EASILY see WHY Marilyn Monroe is the ICON she still is today more 50 years after her
death. She was an incredibly talented artist despite her life and legend. ""Marilyn-The Premiere Collection"" provides all the proof
you need. A Great Collection and A STEAL At The Price!!!",1364428800,,1214,4.555045871559633

it's the newest DVD collection that came out around June, near her hot birthday! and I wanted to see her body on these DVDs, I knew, I KNEW that they where going to be good, and they where :)

I feel like i'm back in the 50's watching here butt pop out on my TV screen, her hair is blonde which makes me feel like I got my monies worth baby!
I also feel like Joe DiMaggio at some of the scenes when her butt pops out at my face!!!

Overall the DVD collection is hot and I would recommend it to any Marilyn Monroe fan, who is in love with her body, because that's what it basically is, right here ya! I come from Texas and she might like Texas Guys, she's my Gal and I lover her a lot, get this men!!

4044277,5,B0030CRK4E,"First of all this box-set is something I would recommend and it's worth the value. There are three sleeves with very nice cover images on each of the three sleeves that shows what movies are in each sleeve. Note to all, not all of these films have Marilyn as the star, so she won't appear as much as she does in some other films. I wish they added ""River of no Return"" to this set, but I don't know why they didn't. I do agree with other reviewers that the package design was not the best and they could've fixed this problem. Most of the films do include special features and trailers on their disks. Overall this is an excellent collection with great movies and I would recommend it to anyone.

4044283,3,B0030CRK4E,"There is nothing wrong with the actual films, as long as you adore Marilyn Monroe.

Unfortunately, no matter how well the seller packs this item or how new it is, it will arrive already damaged. The exterior will look perfect but the discs inside, will almost always be loose. In my case, 14 out 17 discs were loose and all were scratched. And being that it is not the seller's fault, but the manufacturer, I don't see how anything could be done. So it may be somewhat of a risk to purchase, depending on how roughly the Post Office handles it.
A plus on the packaging is the magazine cover article titles pertaining to each film listed- ""All About Eve-Do you have a secret admirer?"" ""Some Like It Hot- How to spice up your relationship"".
An oversight on Fox's part is that on the back of the dvd set, there is a disc image of a film not included, River of No Return.

Overall, the packaging is visually attractive but cheap.

The films included:

Volume 1 1950-1952

All About Eve
As Young As You Feel
Let's Make It Legal
Love Nest

Volume 2 1952-1953

Monkey Business
O. Henry's Full House
We're Not Married
Gentlemen Prefer Blondes
How to Marry a Millionaire
Niagara

Volume 3 1954-1961

There's No Business Like Show Business
The Seven Year Itch
Bus Stop
Some Like It Hot
Let's Make Love
The Misfits

This set includes her main films but excludes River of No Return and The Prince and the Showgirl, along with many of the small role films she appeared in. It would have been nice to see Love Happy and the remaining footage of her final film, Something's Got to Give, included in this set.

Each disc includes special features. However, they are particularly random and unorganized. Some have only commentary. Some have only movie trailers for Marilyn's films bunched together on one disc. Also, way out of place, is the preview of the Diamond Collection, which came out years ago. It just seems like the special features section was thrown together. Few coincide with the films they are featured with.

If you'd like to add Marilyn to your collection, this is a nice cheap set for 17 films. Otherwise, it's really nothing new, unorganized, and incomplete. I'll be waiting for Fox to release a complete set with better packaging and special features.",1353888000,9,2254,4.635678391959799
