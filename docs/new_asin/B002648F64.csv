8351813,5,B002648F64,"Some years back, The Homo Revolution Tour was crossing the Country to raise awareness of LGBTQ Hip-hop Artists.  At the time, it seemed like it was pretty successful - but, then things got kinda quiet & I never heard of any similar, follow-up tours.

Sadly, Mainstream Hip-hop has been NOTORIOUSLY & STUBBORNLY Homophobic, causing many performers to stay closeted & shy away from LGBTQ topics & issues.  The most accepted usage of the topic has been INTENSELY negative, with The Other F Word & ""No Homo!"" thrown about, liberally.

On the LGBTQ Audience side, the Hip-hop Genre has never been as favored Pop, Dance, House, Disco, Techno, Club, or even Country.  So, it has been a real uphill battle for these artists to have any real traction is sustaining any real base-line success.

Hopefully, more films/documentaries, like this, can lead to some break-throughs to a more accepting Hip-hop & LGBTQ listening culture.  Alot of these Artists are EXTREMELY Talented & deserve a wider audience!!!!!",1421712000,,997,5.0426829268292686
8351814,3,B002648F64,"I despise the word ""queer,"" but many of the interviewees use it.  Many media productions that call themselves ""queer"" really are just about gay men or gay men and lesbians.  This documentary stands out in that gay men, lesbians, bisexuals, and the transgendered are equally represented here.
One rapper looked just like MC Serch except that he had lighter hair.
The work is diverse in covering the East Coast, West Coast, and Midwest.  It has Blacks, whites, and Latinos in it.  Still, I thought the white rappers could have said more about their race, not just their sexuality.  To some viewers, their race in a genre deemed mostly Black would make them stand out regardless.  Because there were so many white rappers here, I wonder if the work's makers are trying to state purposely that gay rap is more multiracial than its mainstream counterpart.
This work showed many straight people of color interacting positively with gay rappers.  I thought it was very important to see images of gay-friendly heterosexuals of color put out there.  Then again, there are times when these musicians let homophobia slide and I was disappointed a bit by that.  I understand that we all choose our battles, but the first rap here was homophobic on its face and I wondered if these artists sometimes compromise themselves when they shouldn't.",1246838400,2,1329,4.923766816143497
