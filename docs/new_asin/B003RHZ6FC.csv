8403781,5,B003RHZ6FC,"Just saw the German production Headhunter - The Assessment Weekend"" and was really satisfied with the gritty and humoresque attitude the Kraut director Sebastian Panneck is creating in his homage to the 70ties horror low-budget flicks. The characters are drawn with a sarcastic sense and after a calm beginning the film starts to gather pace. Lots of bloody gruesome deaths are happening to the lost students in the backwoods until the final encounter of the lead figures. The surprising end finishes this cool b-movie with a smacker. A good story telling through the editing is the base for a reliable and sound film experience. The lead actors are American and the performance of all actors is very solid. It seems that most of them are native speakers so the quality of the used language shows not the weakness (sometimes embarrassment) of other European productions with non-English Actors. The ghostly and partly disturbing soundtrack is supporting the dark appearance of the film. On the negative side I have to mention the quality of the colours. The colour correction is not showing what HD can achieve today. The DVD got good extras. On some blockbuster DVD's you will not find that much. I very like the crew film that of the actors had captured. Good editing there too. All in all this DVD is definitely worth the money.",1282867200,,1331,4.893805309734513

I had to watch it a couple of times to catch what I missed the first time. I was on edge throughout! A very well done low budget film, I applaud the director.",1280188800,,286,4.218181818181818
