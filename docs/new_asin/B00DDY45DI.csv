8592406,5,B00DDY45DI,"This is a fantastic movie! Casting was very good, and historical accuracy was also quite good. This is a great deep dive into how the Vietnam War became the debacle that was the final outcome. It is also a great look into the mindset of Lyndon Johnson, and the staff that surrounded him.",1471737600,,287,4.433962264150943
8592407,3,B00DDY45DI,"Found it to be a good movie however I got the impression that they were trying to paint LBJ as a victim, and that somehow he was forced into the war.",1457481600,,149,3.838709677419355
8592408,5,B00DDY45DI,"I not only grew up in the Washington, DC area, but served in the military with LBJ as president and commander-in-chief, and McNamara and Clifford as secretaries of defense. At the time I had no real idea what was happening in the background. Before enlisting I did recall constant coverage of Viet Nam, civil rights and other issues on TV. After enlisting,in truth, I paid little attention to the politics while serving.

This film answered a lot of questions about what was actually going on back in the day. It also gave me personal insights about what really mattered to me - civil rights - and just how important they were to Johnson as well as how important Johnson was to changing the course of a nation in that area.

It boggles my mind to think of what LBJ would have accomplished had he been advised differently. Therein lie the reason why this film is important. It does an excellent job of portraying the different personalities upon whom LBJ placed his trust. It also shows how some of those key figures abruptly changed views, as well as the flawed line or reasoning behind some key decisions.

I was especially fascinated by McNamara - someone I did not respect during my military career - because he was, in fact, brilliant and very persuasive. As I listened to some of his arguments reenacted in this movie I had the advantage of hindsight and could easily spot the flaws. However, if I were present in those meetings with the knowledge available to the key players, it's easy to understand how compelling they were. I also came to admire Clifford for his brilliance and came to regard him as McNamara's intellectual match.

A fact check of a lot of the scenes portrayed in this film revealed that they are basically true. The cinematography certainly captured the era as I remember it, and while the acting is excellent the storyline is even more so. This is an excellent reenactment of the political background of key parts of LBJ's administration, and reveals a lot about America during that period.",1446336000,,2018,4.708215297450425
