1799110,5,B0000714GG,"Thank the theatre gods for releasing this absolutely spellbinding and majestic version originally produced for television in 1973.
Deftly balancing Williams' poetry and Hepburn's staunch strength, this version directed by Anthony Harvey absolutely resounds with gentle power and grace.
Waterston makes a delicate Tom without any of the overpowering effiminate qualities that undermines so many other actors who essay the role. He makes the consumate Thomas Wingfield by acknowledging Tennessee Williams' autobiographical reality and marrying it to idealized forms. Like Jason Robards was born to interpret O'Neill, Waterston was born to bring Williams' to life.
Of course one cannot be too effusive in praising the late great Miss Hepburn. Her Amanda is subtle, heroic and painfully tragic as she tackles one of the American theatre's greatest roles. Her work in this version stands as one of the great performances waiting to be discovered.
Thankfully this version is now availbe and serves as a must own for all fans of this play. Along with Paul Newman's equally excellent version, this demands purchasing and cherishing. Absolutely brilliant.",1058313600,40,1146,5.554285714285714
1799111,5,B0000714GG,"Having just watched the 1973 television production of ""The Glass Menagerie"" I have now seen every Katharine Hepburn performance she ever did on film or television.  From ""A Bill of Divorcement"" to ""This Can't Be Love"" I now have everything on tape (yes, even ""The Iron Petticoat"").  This was Hepburn's first television performance and she was working with Anthony Harvey, who directed the actress in her third Oscar winning role in ""The Lion in Winter.""  Hepburn had seen Laurette Taylor's exquisite performance in the original stage production of ""The Glass Menagerie,"" and had long considered Tennessee William's ""memory"" play to be an American classic.  Even though she is the quintessential Connecticut Yankee, Hepburn trotted out an affect Southern accent and tackled the role.
The play is essentially a gigantic flashback told by Tom Wingfield (Sam Waterston), who is now a merchant seaman in a distant port recalling the final days he spent in the family home in St. Louis with his mother, the faded Southern belle, Amanda (Hepburn), and his painfully shy sister, Laura (Joanna Miles).  Stuck in a dead end job at a shoe factory and constantly going to the movies to escape his mother, Tom wants to be a poet.  Laura, made physically ill by any attempt to go out and function in the real world, has retreated to her imagination and her titular collection of glass animals.  Amanda is constantly talking about the old days on Blue Mountain, browbeating Tom for his lack of incentive, or hustling subscriptions for ""The Lady's Home Companion.""  When his mother badgers him into finding a ""gentleman caller"" for his sister, Tom brings home Jim O'Connor (Michael Moriarty) from work.  Even better, Jim is the boy the Laura had a crush on in high school, although she certainly never would have said anything at the time.  But in a Tennessee Williams play, no good deed goes unpunished.
The centerpiece of the play becomes the scene between Laura and her gentleman caller.  The scene is remarkable in that it is certainly unconventional to give two characters so much time on stage alone like this.  Suffice it to say that on the basis of this extended scene both Morairty and Miles won a pair of Emmy awards each, for Best Supporting Actor/ess in a Drama and Supporting Actor/ess of the Year (the Emmys have had their fair share of strange awards over the years).  Hepburn was nominated for Best Lead Actress in a Drama while Miles received a nod in the Supporting Actress category.
This version of ""The Glass Menagerie"" has the virtue of sticking to the play's original conclusion, which is not what happened with the 1950 film adaptation with Gertrude Lawrence, Jane Wyman, Arthur Kennedy, and Kirk Douglas.  It seems that Hollywood always felt a strong urge to make Tennessee Williams' plays more upbeat on the silver screen.  Once you get past her accent, Hepburn's performance is as nuanced as you would expect, and the rest of the cast more than hold their own.  Given that their paths would almost cross on ""Law & Order,"" it is ironic to find Waterston and Moriarty together in this production.
Kudos to the Broadway Theater Archive for preserving these fine performances on tape and many others as well.  There just are not as many televised plays as there used to be in the old days, and it is great to see that many lost treasures are again becoming available to us as lovers of the theater.",1041897600,85,3404,4.831325301204819

1799143,5,B0000714GG,"Nobody taught us O'Neill or Williams in my schooldays which is pretty sad and pathetic
and reflects the utter lack of taste and competency in our public school (and college)
systems from the 70s onwards.  I'm sure it's even worse now.  In any case, I have a lot
of catching up to do, plus obviously I was all of 5 years old when this version of Glass Menagerie
was released.  Even in film school they didn't screen or recommend watching Streetcar
Named Desire so I dunno what they were thinking.  Although ok, if we'd had a real drama
dept. which we didn't at my college, I guess it would make more sense to assign these
to theatre majors than film students, but I think both could learn plenty from these two
utter and total masterpieces.  Plus, your chances these days of ever seeing productions
(film or on stage) of these two plays performed this masterfully are almost nil.  I guess
for a lot of the newer generations these might appear somewhat dated, but I think real
classics should hold up beyond that, and for me at least, they do, but then again I'm not
17 years old.

I recently watched this after sitting through the Lumet film version of Long Day's Journey
Into Night: although Glass Menagerie is more of a mini-masterpiece compared to the looming
3 hr. juggernaut of Long Days' Journey, the connections between the two authors and their respective
masterworks are there for all to see.  I've seen past films of Glass Menagerie and wasn't that knocked
out by them, I think this, in many ways, is the definitive TV/film version.  I doubt that this cast
or production can be bettered.  Obviously a very sad, difficult piece, but I found it utterly enthralling.
Also, the fact that both works are very much autobiographical makes them recommended companion
pieces, they'd make a great double feature if you can stomach all that pain and darkness in one
going!  Everybody in this is amazing, and Michael Moriarty helps cement the whole ensemble with
his Jim.  This may even make up for his later being in the awful 1980s monster/horror film Q!!!
Anyway, this is what you call an actual masterpiece with actual great actors doing actual great
acting.  Nevermind the play itself, it's a must-watch for the former alone.

A lot of people complain that they can't watch ""heavy"" dramas like this.  Well then, you're clearly
not cut out to appreciate the sheer genius on display here.  In this case, stick to the latest Hollywood fluff.
Most Americans don't like to think, and don't want to ever admit that the ""American Dream"" may be in fact
a myth and nightmare for many.  We cannot allow anybody to think for themselves or feel real emotions,
I guess.  Nothing much has changed I suppose since Williams first started banging out his plays, or
O'Neill, for that matter.  For me, these days, I get more out of these classics since, difficult as they are,
at least they are works with actual substance.",1426982400,,2906,4.673870333988212

Sam Waterston(Tom) did a great job at expressing his character's emotions and feeling of how he sees life whenever he was in a heated argument with his mother, Amanda. Katharine Hepburn(Amanda) perfectly captured the role of an enthusiastic mother who was desperately clinging to Tom and Laura's future. Joanna Miles's(Laura)  gives the impression that she was playing a ""special"" person and did wonderfully at it. She was able to show Laura's shyness and show how her character lives in her own little world. Finally, Michael Moriarty(Jim) was able to show Jim's kindness and sincerity behind his advice to Laura.

1799150,4,B0000714GG,"The Glass Menagerie Review
After I read the play and watched the movie, I realized there were a few slight differences between the two. In the film, Katharine Hepburn is featured as Amanda Wingfield, Sam Waterston as Tom Wingfield, Joanna Miles as Laura Wingfield, and Michael Moriarty as Jim. I thought Katharine played Amanda quite splendidly! She really got into character even though she has a knack for talking. Laura, her daughter seemed much older in the movie, but Tom on the other hand came across more youthful. Towards the end of the movie when Laura is reacquainted with Jim, it almost seemed like Jim truly did have a crush on Laura. In the play, I speculated that Jim kissed Laura out of pity instead of physical attraction. I was honestly expecting Jim to be more handsome, but his charismatic attitude in the movie helped me overlook that.
 In the play, it was harder for me to visualize the animation in the scenes, but I did like how I could imagine them for myself. The play gave many detailed stage directions, but the character's emotions were lost in the wordy descriptions. I better understood Tom's inner struggle and close relationship with Laura in the film. Overall, I enjoyed viewing the film with my AP Literature class, but if I had not read the play my connection with the characters would be very distant.",1418256000,,1337,4.738197424892704

I first saw this movie on television as a teenager and it captivated me from the start.  For one thing, Tennessee Williams has always written stories filled with ""life"" and this definitely is, even though you never leave the one scene.  The visuals are there within your head.  Ms. Hepburn's marvelous emotions and her telling of her character's longing and sadness fill you with all the visuals you need.

This movie is rich in character and emotion, vibrant in intensity and humanity.  The character she portrays may seem sad and pitiful, but far more real and sensitive .  This is truly one of Ms. Hepburn's greatest masterpieces.",1358208000,,829,4.822695035460993

1799213,5,B0000714GG,"This is the first time I'd ever seen The Glass Menagerie.  I read the script in high school with the possibility to get to play Tom but production fell through. That was almost 20 years ago and I can't believe how much of it, great quotes and all, that I remembered.

Katherine Hepburn was pure magic as Amanda and I was totally enamored by her. My one and only complaint was indeed her heavy and fast tone of voice. While it was a trademark that impersonators have played upon for years, it made her a bit hard to understand in places, especially when she was arguing with Tom and rattling on.

Other than that, if I ever directed this production, I'd show my actors this version!  The tone and setting of the movie is brilliant, very close to what I imagine Williams himself imagined for the stage, right down to the paper shade on the bulb above the dining table or the curtains in the doorway. Being made for TV in the 70s, it's pretty bare bones.  Even the sound quality at time leads you to believe this could be a recorded stage version. But Williams called it a ""memory"" play, so I think those stark elements are important and they really come through.

I bought this DVD to watch as research for a piece I'm writing about Williams.  I found it to be very inspiring and worth the purchase.  It is now easily one of my classic favorites and I know I will watch it again and again.",1330819200,2,1387,4.328185328185328

There is also a 1987 film adaptation of the play starring JoAnn Woodward and John Malchovich, which is true to the play.

Made in 1973, this Broadway Threatre Achive features a magnificent performance of Katherine Hepburn, and in my opinion, the only really great performance.

The drama focuses on a family living with their illusions and delusions.  Amanda, whose husband deserted the family, is delusional about her past life, the gentleman callers, the ones who got away, She lives in the past.  Tom, a poet, dreams for more, but works in the warehouse and sees movies all the time.  He is a dreamer.  Finally, crippled Laura, anxiety-ridden, whose fantasy of life is the small delicate glass animals and the victrola.

Mother is domineering and very critical of Tom, and she has asked Tom to invite a gentleman from the warehouse for dinner, fearing Laura will be an old maid.  Amanda's hopes are high.

The Gentleman Caller
Jim was done well, maybe a little too exuberant.  Even though Jim was everything in high school, (little mention), he became a warehouse worker, still dreaming for what he was supposed to be.

The Role of Laura - looking depressed
When we READ the dramatic play, we attach a face and personality to the character.  In this production, least impressive was Laura.  To me, from the book, Laura was alive in her own world and hardly concerned about men, but she was more whimsical and innocent.  But this actor came as depressed and emotionless, certainly not who Tennessee Williams' created.

Sam Waterston ???
Although he wasn't as bad as the actor portraying Laura, I just didn't see this guy as the meek and mild ""poet"", warehouse low wage earner, and a real loner going to movies all the time.  It just didn't fit.

The gem of it all - Katharine Hepburn
There's no doubt this was an amazing portrayal of the Southern belle Amanda.  One of the best scenes were her telephone soliciting, or when she discovers the dream is over with the gentleman caller.

1799242,5,B0000714GG,"Tennessee Williams rightfully takes his place as one of the premier playwrights in the history of the American theater. He relentlessly turned out high quality plays (and other short literary expositions) on subjects that in an earlier day before the 1950's would have not found nearly so receptive an audience. Here Williams, studying a willfully dysfunctional family, relies on a seemingly autobiographical presentation of the life of a faded Southern Belle mother and her two captive children who are fodder to her dreams of renewed grandeur and style when things `get better'. The gist of the better is a suitable husband for her distracted daughter.  That those `things' do not get better drives the dramatic tension of the work, as it almost always does in a Williams play.

Williams has a magic knack for getting to the core of human relations, unpretty as they are some times. The mirror, in many cases, may be harder to take than the reality. Here the son's desire to `help' his obviously unworldly sister at the arm twisting behest of Mother by bringing a co-worker to dinner triggers a trail of events that make Sis fall further and further in the battle with reality. Someone once said that in a Williams's production no good turn ever gets rewarded. And that is the case here.

However, I wish Joanna Miles had portrayed a less robust Laura.  She doesn't limp; she wears stylish shoes while dashing athletically out the door to the store; she demonstrates no more than an occasional interest in the glass animals that are supposed to be her obsession; under her subdued demeanor I felt enough personal strength from her to deny the sense of despair about her future that is supposed to hang in the air at the end of the play.  Perhaps Jane Wyman's Laura should have been in this production rather than being stuck in the 1950 version, with its own lamentable ending.  Perhaps this play is too dated to be believable today and they don't make helpless females any more.  (TV has sent such types into therapy.)  Nevertheless, this is a great late-career performance for Katharine Hepburn, and that's the best reason for owning this DVD, a good companion to ""Lion in Winter"" and ""On Golden Pond.""  She was born to play this faded Southern belle who has no talent for sales except as the determined purveyor of a lost culture.  Her physical fragility plus the trademark Hepburn patrician accent and mannerisms are simply perfect and utterly priceless (whereas Joanne Woodward in the same role is too perky and liberated).

1799246,5,B0000714GG,"THE GLASS MENAGERIE is one of the theatre's great masterpieces.  Originally opening on Broadway in 1944, the play established playwright Tennessee Williams as a force to be reckoned with and provided Laurette Taylor with her final great Broadway role as Amanda Wingfield (check out Rick McKay's outstanding BROADWAY: THE GOLDEN AGE to hear Marian Seldes and others discuss their memories of Taylor).

For this 1973 television production, Katharine Hepburn, at the request of Williams himself, stepped into the hallowed role of Amanda.  Hepburn gives her usual tour-de-force, especially the scene where Amanda is on the telephone attempting to sell magazine subscriptions (the scene is tragic and comic in equal measures).

The story is a memory play, told in flashback by son Tom Wingfield (played by Sam Waterston with all the brashness of youth), of his years living with his mother Amanda and lame sister Laura (Joanna Miles).  Amanda's sole purpose in life is to secure happiness for her children, in particularly Laura, who spends most of her days in seclusion tending to her collection of glass animals.  Amanda, in the meanwhile, finds more pleasure reliving past glories than trying to make sense of her ever-uncertain future. Tom cannot stand his mother's machinations and spends most of his time `at the movies', though when Amanda presses him to find a `gentlemen caller' for Laura, the balance of the household grows ever more precarious.

Joanna Miles simply glows as the repressed Laura.  Katharine Hepburn, as mentioned above, gives Amanda a frailty and strength which is heartbreaking.  Sam Waterston and Michael Moriarty as the `gentlemen caller' offer well-rounded performances.  There is some debate as to which character is the genuine lead role of the play.  True, Amanda is the main role but the story hinges so much on the trials and agonies of the painfully-shy Laura that the play might as well belong to her.

1799247,5,B0000714GG,"A brilliant cast gives life to this 1973 production, lending new interpretations which overcome the dated aspects of this 1944 play.  Set in St. Louis, the action takes place entirely in the crowded tenement apartment of the Wingfield family, which has fallen upon hard times.  Amanda Wingfield (Katharine Hepburn) is a domineering but good-hearted woman with two children, her husband having long vanished.  Her daughter Laura, pathologically shy, spends most of her time polishing her collection of glass animals.  Unable to adjust to the requirements of secretarial school, Laura is totally dependent on Amanda and Tom, her brother.  Amanda is determined to find a husband for Laura so that Laura will be taken care of--and she begs Tom to bring home a friend as a ""gentleman caller.""

Hepburn is wonderful as Amanda, creating an Amanda who is strong and domineering, yet remarkably dedicated to her children.  Hepburn conveys none of Amanda's vulnerability, emphasizing instead her commitment and determination to control the future.  She tries to make Laura into her own image, but Laura is so overwhelmed by life that she lacks the confidence she needs to live.

Michael Moriarty, as Jim O'Connor, the gentleman caller who comes for a family dinner, is terrific in his role.  His ""gentleman caller"" is an enthusiastic young man with plans for his future, but he is also an innocent, not quite aware of what Amanda has planned and unprepared for the depth of Laura's vulnerability.  Rattling on about his life, he is insensitive to Laura's feelings, having no real appreciation for the fact that she idolized him in high school and is overwhelmed by his presence in her home.  Joanna Miles, as Laura, is almost a cipher, a young woman so helpless that she is at the mercy of life's ordinary ""tragedies,"" a woman who obeys her mother because in obeying she has some sort of focus to her life.

Despite these three fine performers, the play, believe it or not, belongs to Sam Waterston.  He shows the agony of a man trapped with a domineering mother and a helpless sister, and though he longs to make them happy, heknows that this is impossible.  He shows a Tom whose desire to make a life for himself while there is still time is almost palpable, and he exudes the angst which makes the play's action ""work.""  Waterston draws all the aspects of the play together, providing the only point upon which the action and climax can pivot with any sense of realism.

A ""memory play"" of a family at a crisis between the old and new ways of life, The Glass Menagerie, and this cast in particular, illustrate the conflict between independence and subservience, and between southern tradition and national post-war opportunities.  Laura, who does not even know what to wish for, represents the old ways;  Tom, the direction of the new.  A sterling cast gives sterling performances here.

1799250,5,B0000714GG,"I just received this yesterday, and immediately settled down, with the cats fed and strict orders of silence, to watch it. What a wonderful, lost jewel. This made for t.v. film was produced the year I graduated from high school, and, the life I then lived in the apartment next to a city train trestle, that I dismally shared with my mother and my dear little sister, was probably a little too similar to Tennessee Williams beautiful play to be of much interest to me then. That this play is based upon his early years is now well known, and, though she denied it most of her life, ""Amanda"", the suffocating mother played by Katherine Hepburn, is undoubtedly Edwina Williams, Tennessee Williams mother. Though she is the focal point, this  ""memory play"" is as much about Williams beloved sister Rose, whose tragic mental illness and subsequent lobotomy froze her in time. The crippled ""Laura"" inhabits another world, as did Rose.  Williams remained devoted to his institutionalized sister, who outlived him, for his entire lifetime, and always proclaimed her his lifelong love. ""Tom"", the brother and narrator of the play, dreams of a life filled with adventure, outside of the despised warehouse where he performs his menial work, and free of the  unwanted obligations to his abandoned mother and sister. Tom was Tennessee Williams real name, and there is much of him in the fictional Tom. When this play was first produced in the 1940's, Williams career was very young. He considered himself a failure, and, the play was not initially well received. Starring as ""Amanda"" was Laurette Taylor, formerly a renowned theatre actress, now a Broadway has-been, whose downfall to drink was well known in the theatre world. Upon seeing her in the first early rehearsals of this play, the financial backer screamed to the producer...""HOW could you do this to me?"" Williams was also sure he had a failure on his hands, and the play produced modest crowds upon opening, and readied for closing. However, two local Chicago critics sang its praises, and, it subsequently received immense critical acclaim and major awards. As did Laurette Taylor, whose performance went down in theatre history, and was her ""comeback"" (she died the following year.)  Katherine Hepburn, who saw the original production, is wonderful in this role. How lucky we are that The Theatre Archive has preserved her  performance. There are close-ups and little bits of business here that make one realize just how rare and skilled an actress she was. What a joy she is to watch. She perfectly conveys ""Amanda's"" suffocating behavior, all in the name of love for her children, of course. With her at times  false joy, and, at other times, her eyes brimming with tears, she repeatedly relives the memories of her bygone youth, beaus of past, and her faded promise, to the all too familiar resignation of her claustrophobic children. You may find her incessent instructions to them on how to breath, eat, stand, etc...exasperating, but this is her controlling nature. Having been abandoned 16 years earlier by her husband, she is determined to make her children ""winners"", saving them and herself from the obvious fact that they are not.  Her grown children are wonderfully and convincingly played by Sam Waterston and Joanna Miles, and Michael Moriarty is equally moving as ""The Gentleman Caller."" A touchingly beautiful version of a classic, and a total pleasure from a gentler, simpler time. Tennessee now lies next to his beloved Rose, whose gravestone is inscribed....""Blow out your candles, Laura...""",1067126400,66,3564,5.030508474576271

Hot Toasty Rag, October 17, 2017

The Glass Menagerie is my favorite play, solely because I love the 1973 taped and televised Broadway performance. I haven't seen any other version, but after watching this cast, theres no need to.

Katharine Hepburn stars as faded Southern belle who mothers and smothers her two children, Sam Waterston and Joanna Miles. Sam is passionate and dying to break out of his stifling environment, but hes protective over his crippled sister and is conflicted about leaving her alone with their mother. If you're a fan of his because of Law & Order, you need to see his stint on Broadway so you can see the first time he delivered a powerful, passionate speech. Its incredible, unnerving, and heartbreaking every time he goes head-to-head with Katharine Hepburn.

Kate had already starred as the overbearing mother in another Tennessee Williams play, Suddenly, Last Summer, but she shines even brighter in this one. Unlike the 1959 film, her character in The Glass Menagerie is sane and accessible. If you're a parent, your heart will go out to her as she tries to look out for her daughter, but Sam Waterston is the real hero of the story. Hes wonderful and energetic from start to finish. I guarantee youll become a lifelong fan of his after watching his breakthrough performance.",1508198400,,1339,4.889867841409692
7973769,3,B0000714GG,"One really significant problem here. Katherine Hepburn, though generally a fine actress, doesn't know how to do the Southern speech of Amanda Wingfield. She rushes it, as though it's normal pass-timing speech. She's not aware that such a character would savor her phrases, the comic-touching poetry which Williams puts into them.  Such a character DECLAIMS almost these speeches, which she has used many times -- almost like a Shakespearean character. Hepburn too often delivers the lines as though it's ordinary speech to be given the ""realistic"" treatment. Having heard it done right on stage, I couldn't watch this.",1504828800,,618,5.3061224489795915
7973770,5,B0000714GG,"One of the finest translations of Tennessee Williams from the stage to film!  Guided expertly by her ""Lion in Winter"" director Anthony Harvey, Katharine Hepburn runs with the meaty role of Amanda Wingfield and gives her a flinty strength probably not usually seen in prior performances of this part, but which explains Amanda's successes as a young lady and her ability to survive as an older one while facing endless disappointment and hardship.  Sam Waterston shines as her restless poet son, Tom, while Emmy-winners Michael Moriarty & Joanna Miles steal the show as Jim, The Gentleman Caller, and Tom's sister, the fragile Laura, whose collection of glass figurines provides the play its title.  A big shout-out must be done for John Barry's exquisitely delicate piano-themed score which beautifully elicits the fracturing of this family.  This DVD is a treat for film-lovers as well as theater-lovers, and is by far second only to A Streetcar Named Desire as the finest adaptation of Williams' work to film.
