931395,4,6304821522,"A fluffy movie chock-full of laugh-out-loud, feel-good moments, primarily at the expense of Kevin Klein's character, a man so closeted that he himself doesn't even realize he's gay - despite his lack of sexual attraction to, well, anyone, including his long-time fiancee, played by Joan Cusack. Then there are those other ""clues"" - his obsession with (of course) Barbra Streisand, his penchant for boogying down to disco when he's alone, his fussy dress and the fact that he's a ""decent human being"" who showers regularly.

There's no doubt that the character hits all of the gay stereotypes - ones that the screenwriter Paul Rudnick, who is gay, defended back in 1997, when the movie was released and he was receiving some criticism. (If you want the ""non-gay gay"" character, there's Tom Selleck as a macho and sleazy TV reporter.) Barring the tiresome infatuation with Barbra Streisand and one scene were Klein goes ""limp wristed"" against his will, the stereotypes aren't that bad (most of the gay men I know in NYC would fit them) and are good for some laugh out loud moments. But in an era where there's basically no outwardly difference between the gay and straight characters in movies and TV anymore, some might take offense. (In a 1997 interview, Rudnick asks whether the gay characters should be ""just as boring"" as the straight characters. In 2017, the answer is yes.)

I'm glad the movie gave Joan Cusack, as the shocked bride-to-be who learns her boyfriend is gay, real anger to work with. As someone who experienced a fiance coming out, I can tell you it's no laughing matter and not something you get over right away. Cusack gets to act just as furious, nutty, and devastated as I did in real life.",1512864000,5,1712,4.8

931398,1,6304821522,The movie is hilarious. The video quality of the download looks like some held a camera in front of their tv and filmed the VHS version of the movie.,1497744000,,149,4.172413793103448
931447,3,6304821522,"if you should ever use the expression ""the devil's in the details,"" only to be asked what that means, this movie could serve as a textbook example. it's by no means a horrible film, but it's less than it could've been. it makes only one mistake, but in an area too central to the heart of the matter not to have repercussions.
Kevin Kline is a marvelous actor. he proved quite indispensable to three of my favorite movies, namely A Fish Called Wanda, Dave, and Wild Wild West. director Frank Oz had already, via the likes of Dirty Rotten Scoundrels and What About Bob?, demonstrated that there was more to him than Yoda and Miss Piggy. so really, those two names alone should signify something special. in this case they represent something that could've been special but blew it.
the story begins on Oscar Night, which especially interests Kline's character, a teacher, because a former pupil is one of the Best Actor nominees. when said pupil does indeed win, his acceptance speech particularly venerates Kline, only to take a left turn. he's already prompted the obligatory round of applause for Kline, only to add ""..and he's gay.""
(the story was reportedly inspired by Tom Hanks' acceptance speech for his Oscar for Philadelphia.)
this frankly feels fishy. because he'd already paused, it comes off as an afterthought. it's as if he wasn't quite happy with his tribute and grabbed for the first ""capper"" he could come up with. gay would be on his mind because his character was gay. so already the film feels hokey, like it's lost it's footing.
believably delivered or not, the revelation manages to turn Kline's life upside-down. his fiance' becomes neurotic, he's now a punchline and figure-of-fun among his friends, and his principal ponders whether or not to discharge him. on top of which, a tabloid reporter comes to town for a follow-up on the newsflash. at one point he tries to reassure Kline by claiming to be gay himself, but he's such a sleaze it's difficult to know whether to believe him or not.
all of which culminates in the wedding scene, where Kline is supposed to say ""i do,"" but it comes out ""i'm gay."" we know this is coming because we know something about how storytelling works, but we're not given any compelling build-up. Kline doesn't have a soul-searching ""maybe they're right"" moment or lapse where he takes active interest in a man. truth to tell, since he doesn't overtly conform to any stereotypes, we really have no tangible reason why anyone should've thought he was gay in the first place. you get the impression that if you were to this community why they're so sure he's gay, they would reply ""why not?""
and that's why the house of cards come crumblin' down. Kline doesn't REALIZE he's gay, he gets BROWBEATEN into being gay.
the film reflects an issue that's made me nuts for years. why do people feel the need to complicate the matter with arbitrary ""clues"" such as he likes theater, or he has fashion sense, or he doesn't play football? (that doesn't even make sense. he has no desire to take part in an activity where the whole point is to chase, fondle, and lie down on top of other men, so he's gay? yeah, right.) just because others you knew were gay had similar quirks? that's like saying your dog who gets along with cats must be a cat in disguise.
the same goes for stereotypes in general, since they all seem to follow a similarly otherworldly reasoning. take the way blacks are something berated for liking fried chicken and watermelon. as it happens, fried chicken and watermelon happen to be two of my own favorite foods, so do the same people hate me? 'cos they might as well.
the thing is, none of that is anything but filibuster. there's a simple, straightforward, uncomplicated acid test: are you attracted to men or women? if you're a man and you say men, you're gay, period. that's the nub of the matter, what with being literally the only official prerequisite.
what i'm saying is, In & Out is an occasionally pretty good movie. in fact, being a plea for tolerance and understanding, it's a potentially noble one. but that's all. it could've been a great movie, maybe even a stirring and inspirational triumph, if it had presented a challenge or rebuttal to all that needless, confusing propaganda. but alas, because it chose to feed off of it, it can only contribute to it.",1496448000,4,4336,4.691601049868766

933554,4,6304821522,"Director Frank Oz's IN & OUT (1997) is a charming little film with a few good laughs. In a story inspired by Tom Hanks' Oscar acceptance speech for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PHILADELPHIA/dp/0800141806/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PHILADELPHIA</a>&nbsp;(1993), Kevin Kline plays Howard Brackett, a prissy-mannered, Streisand-loving high school English teacher. His class doesn't care about Shakespeare sonnets; they only wants to hear stories from Howard about former student Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon), now a young star in Hollywood who's up for an Oscar.

On awards night, Cameron wins a Best Actor Oscar for playing a gay soldier. The last person he thanks is his old English teacher, Mr. Brackett, who Cameron claims is gay! This revelation from the actor shocks everyone in town, especially Brackett, who's shortly due to marry fellow English teacher Emily Montgomery (Joan Cusack), She's waited three years for this and now Emily isn't sure Howard is straight. He insists he is.

One comedic highlight has Howard listening to a cassette tape that extols the listener to explore his masculinity. It's like the guy on the tape can see every little fey thing Howard does. When a Diana Ross cover of ""I Will Survive"" starts to play, Howard, with the encouragement of the taped voice, tries to resist dancing but fails. This is when he finally admits to himself that he'll never be a manly man.

Tom Selleck (sans mustache) is Peter Malloy, reporter for a TV show similar to Entertainment Tonight. Peter's in town covering the big story of the outed schoolteacher, and he stays long after other newsfolk have moved on. Eventually Malloy admits to Brackett that he's gay and that he came out to all his friends and family. Then, right on a street intersection, Peter plants a big kiss on Howard.

Meanwhile, In Hollywood Cameron Drake sees the TV reports about the damage he's caused his ex-teacher, so he heads out to his old home town to try to fix things.

At the wedding, when the minister asks Howard if he'll take Emily in Holy Matrimony, instead of answering ""I do,"" he says: ""I'm gay."" The day is ruined, everyone in church appalled, Emily embarrassed and heartbroken. Now she's thinking of regaining the 75 lbs. she lost for Howard's sake. Howard gets fired and his life seems over.

Cameron almost hits with his car a very drunk Emily, who's staggering around at night after some hard drinking in a local bar. Cameron consoles her and you can see that they've instantly become more than teacher and former student.

The story's climax occurs at high school graduation ceremonies. The school's principal (Bob Newhart) is confronted by Cameron for having firing Howard. One by one, students stand up and declare that they're gay. So do Howard's dad (Wilford Brimley) and mom {Debbie Reynolds) and practically everyone in town. It's a triumph for tolerance and acceptance.

Despite the way I've synopsized this, the movie is really entertaining and worth seeing. It gave me the ""sillies"" more than once.",1378598400,,3057,5.161616161616162

Meanwhile, Howard's folks(Debbie Reynolds, Wilfred Brimley),his brother Walter(Greg Jbara), Aunt Becky(Kate McGregor-Stewart), Aunt Susan(Alice Drummond), Cousin Linda(Selma Blair), along with Howard's colleagues and students are all naturally appalled, especially after Howard's boss Principal Thomas Halliwell(Bob Newhart)becomes edgy with the attention being brought to the school, but then things take a turn for the worse when Howard's get fired after he breaks off the wedding and admits he's gay.

Fortunately; despite Howard being fired, Howard becomes well-respected again when he attends the graduation ceremony to support his students, especially after one student(Shawn Hatosy)got into college with Howard's hard work and gets his classmates to unionize and protest against the school board to show their respect for Howard.

Eventually, Howard's mother Bernice Brackett(Debbie Reynolds)and father Frank Brackett(Wilford Brimley)decide to renew their vows.",1350432000,,1524,6.213270142180095
933750,5,6304821522,"Tonight I've greatly enjoyed rewatching the DVD of ""In & Out"" (1997, USA, directed by Frank Oz, written by Paul Rudnick, produced by Scott Rudin, and starring Kevin Klein, Joan Cusack, Debbie Reynolds and Tom Selleck). This movie has its heart in the right place, has a perfect script, is acted with passionate commitment and looks beautiful throughout.

I love the way that gay and straight stereotypes are playfully tossed around. Selleck is wonderful, Klein shines and Joan Cusack clearly deserved to win, but must be happy with her nomination in the Academy Awards for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. She won in the same category in the American Comedy Awards.

My favourite scene is where Howard struggles through a ""self-help"" audio tape session on How To Improve Your Masculinity. I have been kissed with the same earth shattering intensity as Howard Brackett (Klein) is kissed by Peter Malloy (Selleck) - and it's no surprise that Howard knew then and there that he must be gay. There are lots of great potential quotes, but Debbie Reynolds as Howard's loving and devoted Mum delivers some of the best - including ""Who wouldn't want a wedding?""

I own the Australian Village Roadshow DVD (region 4) and from what I've read in the product descriptions and comments on Amazon USA and UK, this seems to be the only version which includes genuine extras, and the vignette interview statements from the actors, the writer and the director are all gems.

This DVD was made very early in the history of the format - and it is limited in video quality through being a single layer DVD-5 - however it is genuine 16:9 widescreen (no letterboxing), looks great when ""upscaled"" to 1080p, and the Dolby 5.1 surround sound is very well crafted. The quality of the film which they used for this mastering was very good - but you can easily see evidence of dirt etc, which would not be visible if the film were to be professionally restored and remastered for a Blu-ray release - and I believe that this movie fully justifies the effort and expense from Paramount to make this happen. The DVD is now officially ""out of print"", so it's time for an upgrade to keep In & Out in circulation. I'd order the Blu-ray in an instant.",1346457600,,2219,4.711340206185567

Kevin Kline had such a great year in 1997 with two vastly different performances, and while I prefer `The Ice Storm' as a film, there is no denying that his comedic timing and marvelous transformation in `In & Out' is beyond a shadow of a doubt the best performance of the two.  He really sunk into this character and added so many layers, so many ticks that just blossomed forth in such a delightful way.

Kline plays Drama Teacher, Howard Brackett, who is bursting with pride as he watches a former student accept an Academy Award only to have his life spiral out of control when that student thanks him from the podium and, well, tells the world that Howard is gay.  This is news to Howard's fianc&eacute;e Emily and to, well, the whole town, including Howard himself who never thought he was gay but is now starting to question everything he thought he knew about himself.  The news obviously becomes media fodder, and a reporter named Peter Malloy comes to Howard's town to uncover the truth about his sexuality.

I mirror the sentiments expressed by another reviewer who likened this to a Capra film.  The way in which the comedic aspects and the schmaltzy tones are regarded is beautiful because it never dips too heavily into the saccharine but remains feeling genuine and warming.  While it does have a message, it never beats you over the head with it and so it never feels overdone or insincere.  Kline is magnificent, as is Joan Cusack (when is she not?) and Tom Selleck sells his role rather easily.  All in all, this is a delightful little comedy that will bring a smile to your face.",1339545600,,1857,4.5
933754,4,6304821522,"Keep in mind that you HAVE to disregard the first 15 minutes which is basically nothing but total pointlessness concerning no storyline, plot development, characterization, or anything of that nature.  It's *really* bad.

This may be the first time I've ever seen a storyline change *dramatically* in a matter of one simple second!!  While a man is giving a speech at an awards show, he either jokingly or seriously (never really COULD tell) says that a teacher back in a small town was a homosexual.  Now what's interesting is that the teacher was watching this awards show with his wife at home on the couch while this speech was occurring, and RIGHT when the man giving the speech said this questionable line, the guy and his wife froze starry-eyed at the television screen, LOL!  That was definitely the highlight moment of the entire film.  The man was worried the entire town would believe the speech and have a problem with it... even though it wasn't even true and the man is perfectly straight.  At least at *this* point it's not true.

The humor doesn't end there either.  Another memorable moment occurs when at the high school gym the students feel uncomfortable changing their clothes around the teacher given the information that he likes men so they come up with excuses that are by no means believable to try and cover up the fact they're uncomfortable being around the guy.  Keep in mind this is mainly a comedy film with brief moments of drama.  The next moment when the principal in his office room makes excuses because he wants the teacher fired is another hilarious and excellent moment of storytelling.  The principal wanted to make sure the line at the awards show concerning the mans sexual preference was just a joke and not remotely true but... the principal kept tripping over his words and stuttering because he didn't want to say how he *really* felt.

The BEST moment however, is when the teacher gets fed up with the entire town jumping on his case over the possibility of him preferring men, so the teacher decides to build his masculinity by way of listening to a tape on his stereo.  The man on the tape is *hilarious*.  He basically attempts to turn men straight by insulting and humiliating them.  He insults the teacher and everything happens to fall in line and make it appear like he really IS a homosexual.  Very funny stuff.

It gets even better later on when the teacher believes he is a homosexual, and this results in a crashed wedding and several other incidents involving his wife that I'd rather not spoil.  Very good writing overall.

My only complaint is that not *everything* works.  This seems to be because In & Out is a comedy and the moments of sincerity feel tacked on and insignificant.  Plus, you know, the first 15 minutes that I mention above just stinks!  Besides these two problems, classic movie.",1335916800,,2859,4.719758064516129

933821,3,6304821522,"First let me say that i really wanted to like this movie a lot.  NOT because it's a gay movie, but because i really like Kevin Kline.

The detractors say it's a propaganda film.  How is showing a movie where a gay person is a GOOD person propaganda?  Is the Cosby Show black propaganda, because they show a happy, rich black family?  Seriously.  Don't you right-wing nuts have an abortion doctor to kill or something?

Ok, now on the the movie itself.  Kevin Kline did a fairly good job in the movie, as did Newhart and Debbie Reynolds.  But to me, the actor who stole the show was Joan Cusack.  She was very funny in this role, and that made it watchable.  Also, the small town setting & locations were warm and inviting.

But the movie certainly had some problems.  With the exception of the supporting cast, the comedy (particularly what they gave Kevin Kline to work with) was pretty weak.  It was predictable, easy, old, hacky, and really just played upon the most BASIC stereotypes of gay people.  I was offended.  But not because of the stereotypes.  I was offended comedically because of the lack of clever writing.  Yes, yes, we all know many gay people like Streisand, dancing, snappy dressing, and the arts.  It's tired.  This might have been funny to me 20 or 30 years ago.  But now?  Uggghhh....  Somehow, they gave Cusack all the best comedy.  She played the perfect comedic foil for Kline, as she was so fragile, so lacking in self-esteem, and constantly on the verge of a nervous breakdown.  ""Is everyone gay?!""

933826,5,6304821522,"In Greenleaf Indiana, something strange is happening. Everyone is turning gay, or so it seems, as a High School teacher is outted at the 68th annual Academy awards, on National television. The most surprised person is the teacher himself who wasn't quite ready for such a bombshell to be dropped. After all, he is getting married....... or is he? A hilarious comedy starring Kevin Kline, Joan Cusack, Debbie Reynolds, Wilford Brimley, Matt Dillon, Tom Selleck and Bob Newhart. This production is top notch all the way. The all-star cast is fantastic. Joan Cusack gives a stellar performance as the jilted bride. There's not a dull moment and you will be totally enthrolled in the plot right from the start. If you'd rather not see Tom Selleck and Kevin Kline in a hot, steamy kiss, well, get over it. It's hilarious. Terrific acting, great plot, very enjoyable to watch. A great addition to your home video collection. I highly recommend!",1162080000,7,938,4.90566037735849

I've never paid much attention to Tom Selleck, and this is the first time I have ever seen him without a mustache, and he looks so gorgeous in this movie! It was great. Got a little preachy at the end, but the rest of the movie made that part worth it.",1150934400,3,359,3.864864864864865
933857,4,6304821522,"I quite enjoyed watching this film, which is why I give it four stars, even though I think there are some things about it that are seriously problematic. So, why did I like it? Joan Cusack, Matt Dillon, Kevin Kline (in that order) and also a passably funny script -- at least one that is well structured for a feel-good viewing experience.

Joan Cusack is wonderful here. Her blow-up at her wayward fiance after he stands her up  is fantastic, and the scene where she stumbles from a bar out into the street, screaming ""Is this the Twilight Zone?"" at which point she collapses on the hood of Matt Dillon's car (in her wedding dress no less) -- well, that scene is adorable, especially considering that it ends with some truly touching readings of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet -- a play that itself explores competing definitions of masculinity. Yes, here is the heart of the film (so I cannot comprehend another viewer's criticism that the bride is given nothing in this film; she's obviously going to marry the movie star, and get to eat cheetos into the bargain). Matt Dillon is, as ever, the essence of cuteness, and a much more desirable husband than Kevin -- um, I mean Howard.

Kevin Kline does a decent job of mimicking Howard, a repressed gay man. But it still feels like mimicking, rather than acting. Here is also where the problems begin. I guess wearing a bow-tie means you are gay. And, similarly, the Barbra Streisand gag is beaten to death (and beyond). How many times can the viewers tolerate being told that all gay men like Barbra??!! Come on! Also, Kline's attempt to appear gay simply by giving us a limp hand gesture . . . Not only is it not enough; it's really kind of humiliating.

Nonetheless, the final scene does give ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" a run for its money, and I can't deny it: I did really have fun watching this movie. It's basically a sound little production, well structured, reasonably well written, and Kevin Kline can dance.",1147564800,7,1962,4.629310344827586
933858,3,6304821522,"The movie had a refreshing start - an acceptance speech by a past student (Matt Dillon) on the Oscar night upset the life of Mr. Brackett (Kevin Kline), a high school teacher in a great BIG small town Greenleaf, Indiana. He was gay according to the student, but not according to himself and all who knew him. He was also to get married to his colleague Ms Montgomery (Joan Cusack) within a week! What followed was denial, confusion and search for his own inclination, with the help of a national TV host (Tom Selleck).

Kevin Kline was consistently good and one of the best scenes was when he tested himself by playing a tape ""exploring one's masculinity"" at home. He failed in almost all the tests given by the deep bass voice on the tape, none more so with the dancing test. He simply could not refrain from responding to the rhythm, music and pleasure. His dance sequence was analogous to the one by Hugh Grant in Love Actually. Only that Kevin Kline moved like Jennifer Beals in Flashdance!

Even though the second half of the story conformed to the usual Hollywood formula, the gay man stereotyped and the u-turn of the townsfolk response not quite convincing, the movie was very watchable as a whole. Tom Selleck in a supporting role was charming. And the picture-postcard town provided ever stretching green pastures, beautiful small houses and a stunning view of stately school campus.",1144195200,24,1393,4.728395061728395
933859,5,6304821522,"Sitting down to watch this film a hige smile came across my face just about ten minutes in because once Kevin Klines charactor is outed by his now famous student Kamden (Dillon) the movie doesn't let up.  I haven't seen a movie that kept me laughing so much in a very long time.  Kevin Kline plays a English lit professor who, as I mentioned, get's outed by his former student while accepting an oscar for playing a gay charactor and so in the heat of the moment decided to dedicate the award to his professor ""and he's gay"" and at that point...hilarity ensues.  You see, Kevin Kline is engaged to Emily (Joan Cusack in a scene stealing performance) and they are due to be married in just two days...so in those two days he needs to figure out if he's really gay.  One surprising thing was Tom Sellick who doesn't even look the same without his mustache (he actually is much better looking and should keep it off)  Tom plays a reporter who's intent on getting Kevin to out himself, admitt to himself that he is really gay, and all the while poor Emily isn't sure if there is even going to be a wedding.  The movie is great from start to finish and it does touch on some deeper subjects along the line of gay tollerance and acceptance in our society.  When Kamden outs his professor you get irritated when the priciple (played perfectly by Bob Newhart!!!) warns him that if he doesn't get married he'll lose his job.  It's sad to see the way our society will treat something they don't agree with.

Of more concern was the fact that the turning point of the film -- the groom announcing that he was gay at the altar, devastating the bride -- remained unresolved. Yes, there is a happy ending, but the bride is not part of it.

Also, if I were from Indiana, where the story supposedly takes place, I would be offended by me and my fellow citizens being depicted as bigoted yokels.

If you want a comedy that deals with gays sympathetically yet doesn't leave a bad taste in your mouth, try ""Happy, Texas,"" ""The Birdcage,"" or ""Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.""",1126915200,7,681,4.658333333333333

Kline's scholarly and fastidious Mr. Brackett, Matt Dillon as the extremely air headed and self-obsessed actor, and Shalom Harlow as (no stretch here) the super model. All together, the characters in ""In & Out"" are a bit two-dimensional, which makes the story of the film work extremely well.

This is not a brainy movie, rather it is one you can share with your friends. It's a good laugh (the script being very well written) and it doesn't try to be something that it's not.

Does the film have a message? Of course it does, and it's exactly the one you'd assume it is. The message isn't the movie, however. Fans of good humor will love this movie, regardless of the point. Five minutes of Joan Cusack alone is worth the price of the DVD.
Seriously.

 Although this is a typical ""Hollywood agenda"" movie, it is one of the funniest I've ever watched. A teacher, Howard Brackett (Kevin Klein), who teaches English literature in a high school, likes poetry and dancing, is very well liked in the community and is due to be married soon to a lady, Emily Montgomery (Joan Cusack), also a teacher, whom he's been dating for eight years, has his life ruined by a remark made by one of his former students, Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon), who has just won an Oscar in Hollywood. He is ""outed,"" which is news to him! The only ""evidence"", as it turns out, is his vocation, preferences (he likes Barbra Streisand movies! a real indictment) and he's been engaged so long to the same girl without marrying.

 The national press descends on him, in the person of Peter Malloy (Tom Selleck!), who proudly admits to the same alternate life style quirk.

 I was amazed and somewhat chagrined to see Selleck in the role (""I'm the NRA!""), which was so far outside of his normal casting, but he played it well, of course.

 This was an entertaining film because of the superb acting by the cast, and the subject matter is, of course, dear to the heart of the ultra-liberal Hollywood crowd.

933893,4,6304821522,"I caught ""In & Out"" on HBO a few weeks ago, and I thought that it was a hilarious comedy. Finding out that it was written by Paul Rudnick, the writer of ""Marci X"" and ""The Stepford Wives"", and directed by Frank Oz. the director of ""The Stepford Wives."" They work so well together. The only reason why I could only give this movie four stars is because of the last scene. It was too long, and I have seen that kind of scene before. They could have changed that part a little. The best scenes of the movie come from the middle, while Kevin Kline character is becoming confused about his life.
Kline plays Howard Brackett, a high school teacher that loves his job. ""It's my life,"" he replies sometime during the movie. He is just days away from marrying another teacher Emily Montgomery, and he just found out that a former student of his named Cameron Drake was nominated for an Oscar for his preformance in ""To Serve and Protect"" in which he playsa gay solider. On the night where he wins, during his acceptance speech, he says that he was influenced by Howard because he's gay. That leaves Howard, Emily, and his parents Berniece and Frank, at a halt. None of them knew that Howard was gay, and Howard continues to deny it. The press gets involved when Peter Malloy, a gay newsreporter, decides to find out the truth about Howard. As his wedding day comes closer, and Howard continues to be a manly man, and prove to himself and everybody else that he's not gay, while also getting confused about his life.
I like how the filmmakers handle being gay. There are some sterotypes throughout the movie, such as the gay characters moving their hands in a certain way while they talk, or just some of the dialog. Kevin Kline handles the physical comedy well, and the entire movie works because of him. Joan Cusack is hilarious as usual, but she can overact at times. Matt Dillon had a nice small part as Cameron Drake, and it is good that he is playing an actor who is not conceited, and always thinking about himself. ""In & Out"" is a very funny movie that I recommend to all.
ENJOY!

Add to that the sensitive subject of a high school teacher in Indiana being 'outed' on national television and you would seem to have the recipe for an instant disaster.
Director Frank Oz and screenwriter Paul Rudnick turn potential controversy and a touchy subject into a riotous, slapstick comedy with some of the wittiest and funniest dialogue in years.  Kevin Kline as the 'possibly' gay teacher and Joan Cusack as the insufferable and patient fiancee are in top form (Cusack was nominated for an Oscar).  The supporting cast are all veterans and even Tom Selleck does a turn for the better with his acting.
There is nothing but hilarity, joy and even tenderness between the characters with unexpected twists and character turnabouts that will soften even the most jaded.  This is worth seeing if only for Joan Cusack where with a mouth full of bar nuts runs screaming into the street yelling, ""Is this the twilight zone?!""

Kevin Kline magnificantly plays the role of an english teacher whose life turns upside down after watching the Oscars.  His former student announces on national live television that his teacher is gay.  Now, the teacher must do what he can to clear his name.  In his quest, the storyline adds many twists and turns, frequently giving the audience the unexpected.  Matt Dillon and Joan Cusack (in her Oscar nominated role) add to the comedy with their slapstick behavior.  The entire remaining cast and crew also work great.  ""In & Out"" will leave the audience mesmerized and inspired.  This is great not just for a gay audience but also for a straight audience.",1060732800,2,907,4.8311688311688314

Anyway, the story is about a Hollywood heartthrob ""outs"" his small-town high-school drama teacher Howard Brackett during the Oscar telecast, the entire town of Greenleaf, Indiana, wonders if Howard's really gay.

933932,3,6304821522,"This is a hard movie to review because I really wanted to like the message, but ultimately had to settle for disliking the messenger. I am a fairly progressive pro-gay rights person, and was looking forward to a smart, liberating and interesting comedy about being gay. But the screenplay for this movie was so hamfisted that only the considerable acting talents of Kevin Kline (to some extent, but not nearly as much as some people think) and Tom Selleck saved it from one star territory. Joan Cusack has certainly done good work -some much better than this (see for example ""Cradle Will Rock"") but she did not deserve the best supporting actress nomination for this trite example of one-dimensional hysteria.
I did enjoy some of the Barbra jokes (note the spelling please) and the parody of the ""de-programming"" audio course on how to realize your inner heterosexual was initially quite funny but like a bad Saturday Night Live sketch, it just went on and on and on until gradually I lost any sympathy I might have had for the characters or the plotline. I'm still waiting for the cinematic setting that does true justice to ""Macho Man"" by the way, -it certainly wasn't the ending scene in this movie.
The fact that people fell all over themselves to praise this lame Hollywood attempt at commercial PC comedy just goes to show that cinematic liberation will not be achieved by suited corporate drones with degrees in communication and an eye on the bottom line.
I'm not an activist (although if going on a few Pride Marches and AIDS walks count me as bound for the Pit, then I guess I'm on my way) and I'm not very familiar with the intimate details of the lives of lots of gay people, but I have a fairly good cross section of gay friends, co-workers and acquaintances and I can't say this movie was even one tenth as funny, pointed or perceptive as the real gay people I know.
The ideas in this movie were expressed much more effectively (at least to me) by more skillful and imaginative gay-positive movies such as ""Priscilla Queen of the Desert"", ""The Naked Civil Servant"" ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", ""The Full Monty"", and even (god help us) ""To Wong Foo With Love"".  The fact that the first four are NOT US movies is not a coincidence.  Treating gay people as if they were defined by their personhood and not their sexuality seems to me to be a much more satisfying route than going on (and on and on) about whether someone likes to dance or how they walk or how they use their hands.
Ultimately the real scandal in this movie, in my opinion, was not its treatment of gay people, but rather the way it depicted a hero who could afford to decorate his own home in such ""Town and Country Living""-style opulence on a small-town public school English teacher's salary.",1038787200,5,2775,4.604040404040404

933934,5,6304821522,"I've just watched this movie for maybe the fourth time, and laughed hysterically throughout. That may not seem so amazing, save for the fact that I hated this film upon first viewing at the theater. Though I'm not that political, I guess that, after reading the reviews, I was primed to hate what seemed to be a generic, pasteurized, hetero-ized version of gay life. I ho-hummed my way through it, with an occasional sneer thrown in, and only the most hesitant of a snicker or two. Thinking that I'd never bother to see it again, I did just that when my signifigant other bought the video a few months later. Having relaxed a little, I viewed it with a non-judgemental-let's-just-try-and-enjoy-this-attitude. And, surprisingly...did. Attitude does have alot to do with whether or not you're going to enjoy this film. If you're expecting a perfect portrayal or an over-all view of gay life, you're probably going to be offended. So, don't (expect it). It's a STORY, a simple, very funny story about one man's experience, improbable at times, yes. It is PURE entertainment, and no more representative of gay life than ""Beach Blanket Bingo"" is of straight life. The comic performances are all great. Kevin Kline is very funny and likable , and I found his ""meek"" portrayal appropriate to the story. Joan Cusack is side-splittingly funny as the jilted bride, and is just as effective with a facial expression as with a great line. Tom Selleck is great also, cast against type, as the gay reporter, and displays real comic ability in his delivery. Matt Dillon is very humourous also, as the Brad Pitt - like actor, who's so cool that he's corny. And real life supermodel Shalom Harlow hysterically turns the tables on her own profession in her cameo as the vacuous supermodel girlfriend of Dillons ""Cameron Drake"", and her portrayal is dead-on. There are numerous funny scenes, some subtle, that are uncovered at each viewing. There were a few parts that I could have done without, if just on an artistic level, such as the ""I'm gay""...""I'm gay"" supposedly supportive proclimations from the filled auditorium. Maybe younger gays wouldn't find this film that funny, but, many from the ""Baby Boomer"" generation and before would be fibbing if they said that some of the so-called stereotypes aren't true, I mean, Merman... Streisand, HELLO??!! I could round up about 50 friends today that would be cracking up at the familiarity of these portrayals. I'm sure that maybe some radical gays would accuse me, or anyone who finds this film or any of its kind humourous, of being self-loathing. On the contrary, it is my opinion that it takes the opposite of that to be able to laugh at ones self, or, certain of ones undeniable traits or tastes. And laugh I did... alot. If you want to view this movie as propoganda, or be offended by it, you probably will be. Also, some may just not find it that funny, that's what personal taste is all about. But, if you want to just enjoy what I found (after I ""lightened up"" a little) to be a very funny, touching, silly, heartwarming film, I would definatley recommend ""In & Out.""",1033689600,5,3107,4.776951672862453
933935,5,6304821522,"Many people complain that this film deals in stereotypes and dips into feel-good-preachiness toward the end--all of which is quite true.  But for all the controversy surrounding the premise of a presumably straight highschool teacher who is ""outed""--maybe falsely, maybe not--by a former student on national television, ""IN & OUT"" is essentially a classic Capra-style comedy, and comical stereotypes and feel-good-preachiness is part of the basic equipment.  It is precisely the sort of film Capra might have made in 1939 with Jimmy Stewart and Jean Arthur, only brought up to date and given a modern spin.
The performances, particularly from Kline, Cusack, and a very unexpected Tom Selleck, are nothing short of brilliant; the script is both witty and funny and moves a long at a fast pace; and everything about the films leaves you wishing (unless you happen to be hysterically homophobic) that things really turned out like that in real life.  Realistic movie?  Of course not--but then neither was ""Mr. Smith Goes To Washington"" or ""Meet John Doe"" or ""It Happened One Night.""  Kind and clever and witty and lots of fun?  Absolutely.

For starters, I never believed--ever---that Kevin Kline's character was gay. Why? Because (1) we are never given an explanation as to why his former student (Matt Dillion) outted him on public TV, three days before his wedding,when it was never questioned by anyone (2)his homosexuality his based entirely on stereotypes, the same ones which are later mocked by a room full of people in defense of Kline being gay,(3) the screenplay completely shut Kline's character up after he came out (except for a few meaningless words), and (4) he was endlessly pressured to 'come out' by an annoying TV journalist (Tom Selleck) who even went as far as kissing him unexpectedly, and the film had the audacity to claim that gays *never* recruit!!
This film is simply a propaganda piece disguised as a comedy. (...)The teaser at the end of the film, in my opinion, was unforgivable.
Folks, use your brains while watching this garbage, since very few people apparently have who've seen it. The underlying dishonesty is there. This film has an agenda all its own, and it is not to make us laugh.",1004918400,12,1218,4.777251184834123
933982,5,6304821522,"What a hoot this endearing comedy is. Kevin Kline is excellent as the high school teacher, who may or may not be gay, but the entire cast is outstanding from Joan Cusack, as his long-suffering fiancee, to Debbie Reynolds, as his wedding-addicted mother. (""I want this wedding,"" she tells Kline. ""It's like heroin."")
Paul Rudnick's wickedly clever script takes its cue from Tom Hanks' real-life acceptance speech at the 1994 Oscars, in which the latter thanked his GAY high school teacher for inspiring him to make the movie Philadelphia. In the movie it is Matt Dillon who makes the same speech after winning the Best Actor Award in another supposedly ""breakthrough"" gay-themed film. (This movie-within-a-movie is itself a gay parody of Born on the Fourth of July.)
Rudnick's gift for creating memorable characters and hilarious dialogue make this the kind of movie that can be watched over and over again. At the same time, he also achieves what no ""serious"" gay movie has succeeded in doing: he exposes the absurdity of homophobia. Humour, rather than preaching, is his weapon.
Special mention should be made of Tom Selleck, whose jaded trash reporter is one of his most enjoyable - and daring - portrayals.

If I may reveal a secret: I keep watching this movie over and over again, it is so appealing it makes me anxious to see the next scene. Need I rave about the cast? Kline is always great. Joan Cusack, holy shnykis is she funny. She has the best expression of anger (and lament) in film history, like Nic Cage and Al Pacino for instance. And Bob Newhart: I nearly wet my pants when at the end he observes the entire dance with his Buster Keaton-like stoneface.  As trivial as this move may seem, I think it is a valuable asset in dispelling (and poking fun at) anti-gay prejudices. Perhaps the humor disguises the often painful experience of many gays and lesbians to come out in a infinitely more hostile environment than Greenleaf, Indiana.

933987,4,6304821522,"In and Out (Frank Oz, 1997)

I never really forgave Kevin Kline for Consenting Adults. Not only was it a godawful film, but it was just plain morally irresponsible-- people have enough problems with open marriage without adding psychosis to the mix, and predictable psychosis at that. So every time I end up watching another Kevin Kline flick, I'm always half-scared I'm going to end up wanting to burn the tape (and then have to pay the fine, and, well, you know). Didn't help that Frank Oz hadn't really hit one out of the ballpark himself since What About Bob?. But Paul Rudnick is one of the finest comedy writers on the planet, if highly underrated (most of his work has been uncredited, to said work's great detriment), so hey, why not?

Between the three of them, and surrounded with a seriously high-power, high-talent cast, they manage to pull it off with considerable aplomb. Kline plays a high school English teacher who is outed by a former student on national television (at the Oscars, no less) three days before his wedding. Oops. It becomes a national news story, and Kline finds himself pursued (in more ways than one) by Peter Malloy, a down-on-his-luck reporter played surprisingly well by Tom Selleck.

While it's a tad high on the cute-and-fuzzy scale, the undercurrent that runs through the film is pure-D hysterical. Kline goes around insisting he's not gay, while his small-town compatriots, brainwashed into believing everything the TV tells them, steadfastly refuse to believe him. It's gorgeous, and it's completely unexpected from a film with this many highly-paid Hollywood connections. When the media can make fun of itself, it doesn't matter how good the film is, it's already above average. Excellent performances by Kline, Selleck, Joan Cusack as Kline's fiancee, and Matt Dillon as the stoned-out Oscar winner, are just icing on the cake. *** 1/2",977184000,2,1880,4.980891719745223
933988,4,6304821522,"I had a roommate in college who had some mannerisms that were ""feminine"".  Many people just assumed he was gay even though he was quite a lady's man.  He had a bathrobe that was a little too large for  him and he offered it to a guy in the dorm who was a little larger than he.  The bigger guy had apparently reacted negatively (I didn't witness this).  The two had been getting along well the big guy had even been a guest in  our room for small social gatherings.  Things cooled down quickly after  that.  It is a little amusing how people with no animosity towards gays can  be a little uneasy in the presence of people whom they suspect may be gay.  Every one in the film realized that the main character, a high school  teacher, was effeminate and accepted him.  However, when rumor was out that  he was gay, everyone became less at ease and formed a concerted effort to  make him appear more masculine.  This included such subtle things as hand  gestures and tone of voice.  Meanwhile, a male television reporter played  by Tom Selleck, who was not effeminate, had ""come out of the  closet"" and suggested that the teacher do the same.  The teacher  insisted he wasn't gay and proceeded with the ""masculinization"".  The movie is not really left-winged and does not deal much with issues of  the gay community.  Rather is focuses more on people's reactions to people  rumored to be gay.",959731200,2,1390,4.504032258064516

The comedic portion involves this man living in  a small town where everyone knows each other, him being days away from  marrying his girlfriend of three years (Cusack), and the rumors spreading  like wildfire.
Kevin Kline, as usual, gives a very convincing  performance.  His reaction to his trials is both captivating and hilarious.  His quiet moments are poignant and his outburst are usually side  splittingly funny.
Joan Cusack as the fiancee pulls off an outstanding  performance.  Despite the fact that her situation is portrayed in a funny  manner, you can't help but feel sorry for her and wish her to find  happiness.
The smaller parts are what also make this movie good.  Tom  Selleck's portrayal of a semi-sleazy network correspondent who helps to  convince Kline that he's gay is great.  Bob Newhart as the high school  principal is done in his own inimitable way.  Wilford Brimley as Kline's  father does a brilliantly subtle job.

However, as the film goes, it gets more and more serious.

While many people might  be up in arms about how the movie clings onto the stereotypes for  homosexuals, that's what the movie is about: How people are always accused  of being gay just because they fit these stereotypes. There is nothing to  be upset about at all in this film. My only complaint is that the film is  in too much of a hurry to get from one joke to the next. Yes, it's true,  many jokes were missed because the film didn't spend enough time on a topic  as it could of because it was always in such a hurry to move on to another  funny topic.

Joan Cusack needs to win the  Oscar one of these years; she manages to be an outrageously effective comic  actor AND empathetic and sweetly feminine all at the same time.  Kevin  Kline does a lot with a painfully thin role; Tom Selleck is surprisingly  light on his feet.  Yet the premise never quite delivers on its promise of  comic mayhem and some realistic resolve that doesn't feel like a let-down.
