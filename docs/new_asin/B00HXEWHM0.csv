6242472,5,B00HXEWHM0,"This set contains the discs & episodes from the Voyage 1 & 2 sets of ""season 4,"" really season 7-8 in Japan.

It has the entire Foxy Pirate Crew/Davy Back Fights arc and the first few episodes of Water 7. I think the cover having Foxy on the it is a bit justified, as there's no other Strawhats that I can see that they'd put on it that they haven't used already, for the episodes they have in this set.

23 episodes, 207-230, commentaries on some of them, great artwork, and a lot of episodes for the price, I don't see too much wrong with it. Definitely pick it up, if you, like me, didn't pick up the Voyage sets for one reason, or another, in favor of these sets.

It has 1 episode still in fullscreen at the beginning, then goes to widescreen the next episode directly after it, so that's a bit weird, but other than that, it has great picture quality, great action, great animation, & a great dub, so pick it up while you can for less than $15.",1398384000,,950,4.180327868852459

6242474,5,B00HXEWHM0,"This should be in Widescreen just like the rest of season four, right? If so Im trading in my season four and this to my Collections 1-8 26 episode sets.",1392508800,4,153,4.133333333333334
6242475,5,B00HXEWHM0,"For those of you who have the 8 25ish-episode collection sets like I do, then you must be excited. However, I do now have to sell Season Four Voyage One and Voyage Two. This set will include the Davy Back Fight Arc (Foxy Pirates) and the Oceans Dream Arc (Lost Memories) leading up to the Water Seven Arc. Also, plenty of commentary will be featured on this set along with the new 16:9 aspect ratio.

Short summary: (spoilers)
Basically, instead of a crew fight, the Straw Hats face off in a sporting event called The Davy Back Fight, in which you can lose crew members when you lose a game/event. Chopper and Robin result in being taken after 5 of these games (a boat race around the island, a basketball styled game, a skating race, dodgeball, then a red/green light styled game) and it's up to Luffy to win them back in the Final Boxing Round against Silver Fox Foxy. Can he do it? No, of course not. Chopper and Robin are never to be seen again.... haha although this is a fairly cheesy arc, it's got some phenomenal scenes in it with humor and the new WIDESCREEN animation. It honestly looks like a brand new show once the 16:9 sets in and the coloring is incredible. My favorite event was the basketball styled one with Zoro and Sanji as participants. The show just keeps getting more and more funky and is a pleasure to watch with a Rec. ;)

In the Oceans Dream Arc, a young boy with a mystical seahorse steals the memories from the Straw Hats. Every member besides Robin loses their memories from the point that they joined up with Luffy's crew. Some remain friendlier than others when they do not know what's going on, but for the most part, none of them believe Robin's claims of them knowing each other. Since Robin doesn't have an idea of how they met each other (she joined the crew last at this point), she can't clarify their past with each other to them completely. Well anyhow, a lot goes on including a fight between a possessed Zoro and Luffy ultimately resulting in the crew regaining their memories. After this Arc, there is a short appearance from Admiral Aokiji so we get to see what's to be expected as future competition for the Straw Hats. He uses a Devil Fruit giving him ice capabilities and pretty easily disturbs the crew's carefree, ""we can beat anyone"" pace. Robin has a past with this Admiral, which is later explained.

Overall, this collection is quite an enjoyable ""filler"" set, if you can even consider it one. If it was still in 4:3 aspect ratio, then I may have called it one myself but the action/animation/comedy/dialogue involved makes it 2 powerful, short arcs. Good pre-order price for the set too. :) Ready for a Collection 10!!!",1390348800,19,2674,4.532091097308489

I don't take Foxy seriously as a villain (I know I'm not supposed to, but he seems like nothing more than a villain I'd see in a filler arc). Heck, Oda himself admitted that the arc in question was just an excuse to set up the introduction of Aokiji. if you can get through this, then you'll find the next two arcs well worth the payoff.",1443225600,,428,4.107142857142857

There are about 5 filler episodes at the end, but that's it. After that it starts to pick up again & sets you up for one the greatest arcs in OP.",1404259200,,291,4.12280701754386
6242521,5,B00HXEWHM0,"One Piece is a story of a boy called Monkey D. Luffy who wants to become King of the Pirates. He sets out to sea to gather a crew and make his dream come true.
This is an ongoing manga/anime series with currently 751 chapters and 650 episodes. However the english dub is only available till episode 336.

Yes everybody who owns upto collection 8 has been waiting for this set. But this set contains mostly filler and if you own the voyages DONT BUY THIS it's not worth it. But if you don't own the voyages then this is the set for you. This set contains episodes 206-229 i.e 23 episodes and is only for $15 but two voyages, season 4 voyage 1 and 2 make up the episodes in this collection and add upto a total cost of around $45 which is three times the cost.
Collections vs Season sets
Pros
1. They are dirt cheap
2. They contain twice as many episodes as the season sets
3. They have better packaging

Cons
1. They are 97 episodes behind the season sets
2. The period between consecutive releases in the Collections is way longer than in the season sets.
If you can't wait and year or two for the newest english dub releases than go ahead and buy the season sets but if your budget is limited and you don't mind staying 100 episodes behind the latest releases then buy the collections.
THE COLLECTIONS ARE JUST TWO VOYAGE SETS COMBINED TOGETHER AND DO NOT CONTAIN ANY EXTRA CONTENT.

(SPOILERS AHEAD)
One Piece Collection 9:
This set contains the Davy Back fight, The Lost Memories Arc and the fight between Aokiji and the Straw hat crew.
In terms of video quality this set is a tremendous improvement from the last set as from episodes 206 onwards the episodes are in 720p HD. Though you will not get 720p on the DVD the picture is still amazing. (Funimation when are you releasing One Piece blu rays?). Also this set is in 16:9 format as opposed to the previous sets which were in 4:3.
In terms of audio quality and dubbing funimation has done an excellent job. We get 3 audio options
1. English Dolby 5.1 surround
2. English Mono
3. Japanese Stereo
This set is packaged beautifully although the discs have no disc art. Also this is the first collection which does not feature a Straw Hat crew member on the cover.

One Piece DVDs to buy:
1. Collection 1-9 (Cost approx $140)
2. Seasons 1-5 (Cost approx $ 340 and around $210 for the same episodes as in the collections)

Overall this was a satisfactory buy for me and I recommend any One Piece fan to buy this. (Provided you don't own the season sets)",1404259200,3,2505,4.366952789699571

6242575,5,B00HXEWHM0,"I absolutely love this series. I have been following One Piece for years now and being able to purchase it is simply awesome.

Now on to the box set it self I like it, it carries 23 episodes at a good price. I don't watch the dub since I particularly don't like dubs and because I have always seen One Piece in Japanese so for me Mayumi Tanaka is the only Luffy, however that is just my personal opinion and biased. That being said the Japanese audio is awesome I loves it though the English subtitles can be a little off sometimes where they try to make it understandable for your average English speaker who probably won't understand the Japanese cultural reference I guess... The episode in particular is ep 216 where the subtitles change the game from Daruma-san ga Koronda to red light Green light which is the American equivalent, but still in this ep the subs go off at some point where they say DTD (Docchi Tacchi Daruma san) but they use red light green light as well in the subs it just irks. Other than that all's good. Love afro Luffy hilarious and when Aokiji come out for the first time is just awesome, haven't finished this box set yet but seen it already  so I know it's awesomeness.

For those of you who do hear the dub I have heard they are good and won't make your ears bleed lol again I personally have not seen any of these episodes dubbed so I can't really say anymore on this subject.

Definitely recommend this purchase, especially if you want to continue buying the series like my self. I vote for 23 episodes over 13 episodes in a box set simply because it saves you pocket money. The box sets are nice quality and really anyone who follows One Piece should know that the anime is well over 600 episodes and ongoing so definitely buying 23 or sometimes 24 episodes at a time will save you cash on the long run. You should be warned that the release dates for each of these box sets takes a while so if you are patient like myself cool, If your a hard core collector or a person who just can't wait to get their hands on the next few episodes go for the other box set it's just as good.
