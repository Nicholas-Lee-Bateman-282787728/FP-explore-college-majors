5883040,5,B00E0PHNKQ,The director made the film without a budget and made nothing from it. The film is a chance to introduce the world to a group of amazing and inspiring people living in a little understood part of the world. You will learn some history and cultural details that you didn't know and be inspired to give a part of yourself to someone in need.,1393545600,,338,4.296875
5883041,5,B00E0PHNKQ,"I have lived here in Cambodia for quite some time. I have seen many movies made. Many over sensationalize certain aspects to grab the viewers hearts.. This movie is factual, with several visits and interviews of the Khmer riight in thier home villages, and shows the impact a cup of water offered in love can make..",1382745600,2,315,4.642857142857143
5883042,5,B00E0PHNKQ,What a history of the people and country of Cambodia and those who dropped everything to do the Lord's .  So many children raised on the streets with nothing and little hope in a country so corrupt. It is a film that that makes you start thinking about how blessed we are and there are so many places in this world that need to know that the Lord loves them and that there are special people who will help them and let them know that they do matter and are loved by God.  If you are a history buff and  would like to know more about the Killing Field in Cambodia and how it effected  todays life this is the movie. Excellent.,1378598400,3,625,4.098360655737705
8599854,3,B00E0PHNKQ,The Christian organizations mean well but there is that pressure from them to convert the Cambodian people to follow Christianity. The organization should focus on education and studies that will help the people of this war torn country bounce back.,1519948800,,249,5.25
8599855,1,B00E0PHNKQ,"Don't waste your time watching this! Corruption is everywhere in Asia including in China, Thailand and Vietnam. So please don't make it sound like Cambodia is the only country being run by corrupted officials. This guy has no clue about the history of Cambodia. He stated that ""Angkor was built based on corruption"" a thousand years ago. Please study the history of Cambodia thoroughly before making such foolish statement. In the 1950s and 1960s, Cambodia was one of the prosperous countries in Southeast Asia. The Vietnam war brought total destruction to Cambodia. Nixon and Kissinger dropped about 2.7 million tons of bombs on Cambodia which caused total devastation to the country and helped bring the communist Khmer rouge to power. This film has other motives which is to convert poor young vulnerable Cambodians to Christianity disguised as helping them. Very dishonest.",1519344000,,877,5.226950354609929
8599856,5,B00E0PHNKQ,It is wonderful what these organizations are doing to help these people. It is a really good documentary.,1510358400,,105,4.888888888888889
8599857,1,B00E0PHNKQ,"They put too much effort into making it known that they're Christian organizations. It's perfectly fine that they are, but I feel like they should be helping without pushing a religion on children.",1491264000,,197,5.0
8599858,4,B00E0PHNKQ,This film reinforces my belief that people from small organizations do more for other people than governments and very large organizations with huge overhead.  The work done by these Christian missionaries is long lasting and certainly not a band-aid approach to solving real problems for the poor in Cambodia.  I find the same approach works well in Haiti where I go on mission work each year.  The poor need education and a way in which to earn money.  They don't need handouts.,1477785600,,480,4.817073170731708
8599859,5,B00E0PHNKQ,"This is a very good documentary about what happened after the Khmer Rouge killed one million Cambodians in the 1970s. While Christian, it is not preachy and it is honest. If you like recent history, watch this movie.",1472169600,,216,4.7105263157894735
8599860,4,B00E0PHNKQ,"This documentary is about Christian organizations working with orphans in Cambodia. There is some heavily religious messaging, but as a non-Christian myself I still found it interesting. I think this is especially useful for those interested in development/volunteering/mission work. You will also get some insight into Cambodia and its rural life, the level of poverty there, and some of what can actually be done to help. It teaches a bit about the Buddhist views there too, but take it with a grain of salt. If you really want to learn about Buddhism, learn from a Buddhist.",1461283200,2,577,5.020833333333333
8599861,2,B00E0PHNKQ,so so movie don't waste your money watching this one,1432684800,,52,4.3
