7964267,4,B000068M9T,"A young boy named Nakahito, who is a mystic in training accidentally awakens an artificially created human named Kurumi. She is called a ""Steel Angel"" and is completely loyal to whomever awakens her. The army is after her to use her power as a weapon. They send other Steel Angels after her to bring her back, but the other Angels end up living with Nakahito and Kurumi instead. Lot's of silliness ensues. That's pretty much the plot in a nutshell.

This anime is a lot of fun. The characters are cool and the laughs keep on coming. There is an ongoing story line but for the most part the show is about Kurumi being bubbly and goofy while trying to have fun with Nakahito. The animation is pretty good for an older series, and most of the voice cast is ok. Kurumi's voice can get on your nerves sometimes though. My only major complaint is the episode length. The episodes are like 10 minutes long. There is a preview and a closing song after every episode, so prepare to wear your remote batteries down skipping them. After the main story, there is a time warp of 80 years or so. Nakahito is obviously dead and Kurumi is awakened once again by his granddaughter. Now Kurumi is in love with a prepubescent girl. It gets kinda creepy. All in all this series is pretty fun, but it's nothing to write home about.",1355011200,,1310,4.435684647302905
7964268,5,B000068M9T,"I love this volume, particuarly since Saki is such a fun character in this.  Her hopeless love for Kurumi is sweet yet funny, and made even funnier by the fact that Kurumi doesn't notice her at all.  This volume also brings more depth to the relationship between Nakahito and Kurumi, and their love is very sweet (and actually quite non-sexual despite the protests of fans who like to scream ""pedophilia"" - technically Kurumi's only a few years old).  Another good part is Karinka, although her initial appearance is incredibly disturbing.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, however.",1095724800,,585,5.0
