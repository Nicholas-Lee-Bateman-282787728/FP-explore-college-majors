5185020,3,B008VECEC4,"I got this today at Walmart... its a whopping 22 minutes long for ten bucks. There are a couple special features, but hardly enough to justify the cost. Should of been more like five bucks. Wait for december, it's bound to be on tv.",1351814400,3,232,4.295454545454546

5185025,1,B008VECEC4,"Wish that I would have watched the trailer first. Bad animation, and other episodes had nothing to do with Christmas. Would not buy again.",1508803200,3,138,4.791666666666667
5185026,5,B008VECEC4,"This Spongebob Christmas special has become a family tradition in my home. It is a very funny Spongebob episode in the style of claymation Christmas specials like Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964), The Little Drummer Boy (1968), and Jack Frost (1979).

The plot involves Plankton's attempt to end Christmas by feeding Jerktonium to all the residents of Bikini Bottom. My favorite line comes from the Christmas carolers who have been turned into jerks: ""Wrong bells, buddy!""

Note that the Christmas special comes bundled with another normal Spongebob episode, which is barely worth watching.",1504742400,2,595,5.387096774193548

8530843,4,B008VECEC4,"These work well. They snap on fast and my 3.5 year old cant open the doors with them on.  It requires hand strnegth he doesnt have and understanding how to do it of course.  Theyre easy to use as an adult.

Con:  they fall apart somewhat easily and need to be snapped back on sometimes but overall work well.",1520208000,,308,4.169491525423729
