3045742,5,B00104AYFQ,"I saw this movie in the theaters and had to buy the dvd.  First of all, I love Mandy Moore and would buy anything with her in it.  It's a romantic love story about a man with serious issues and he falls for Mandy.  Very good.",1222819200,4,225,3.847826086956522
3045743,1,B00104AYFQ,"Two men view porn films to gather ideas for children's books. Since this was the most original idea in the movie, I recommend that these DVDs be immediately promoted to coffee cup coasters. The main male character is a victim of child abuse who never faced it, instead developing various obsessive compulsive behaviors in order to make him so busy with minutiae (like arranging napkin and sugar dispensers at the restaurant) that he is too busy to heal. He spends who knows how much time searching for a special rock that he gave to the female lead and then threw away, eventually finding it among the myriad stones of the beach. While some symbolism may be intended, is giving her the rock supposed to be his cathartic experience and now everybody lives happily ever after? The female lead, whose posture indicates more a need for therapy and Pilates than a relationship, gets to choose between a man who cheated on her and one whose emotional scars leave him emotionally unavailable unless she enjoys navigating the pits and falls of his damaged emotional landscape. A dreary miasma of moral relativism, substitution of co-dependency, and celebration of victim-hood as a replacement for self-actualization and love.",1220832000,3,1217,5.0
3045744,5,B00104AYFQ,"Henry Roth (Billy Crudup) writes books for children all the while
suffering from the ramifications of a childhood with a missing father
and an abusive, probably violent, mother. He has a bit of an OCD
problem as well.

His mentor, best friend, and parent replacement, is Rudy Holt (Tom
Wilkinson), who illustrates Henry's books. When Rudy dies, Henry is
devastated. He keeps imagining seeing Rudy, thus continuing to let
'Rudy' tell him how to handle Life. Something Henry is not very good at
at his own.

He is teamed up by his publisher Planck (Bob Balaban) with a new
illustrator, Lucy (Mandy Moore). In the beginning, he treats her like
he would anybody else, which means mean, but it becomes very clear that
she is a nice person and quickly he begins to like her. But he doesn't
know how to break the habit of being strange and sarcastic. (Anybody
who's been shy and hurt knows that being rude or weird is a perfect way
to stay safe; to keep people away from the core).

Here is what he tells her in one long hilarious monologue which
conveyed by the brilliant Billy Crudup comes out exasperated,
hesitantly and too fast all at the same time and with a voice that is
nearly broken , due to the fact that he has realized that he's told her
far too much:

""I hate my mother I hate my goddamn dead father more, Rudy was the only
friend I ever had, I had a girlfriend once who I used to like to
masturbate to more than have sex with, carrots and snakes frighten me
um I'm superstitious about the numbers (3. 5. 7) I can only stir things
counter-clockwise and I know that if I don't something bad will happen,
I take a size 11 and a half shoe I don't have a favorite book, I don't
drive or ride in cars, statistically speaking you have a 100% chance of
being in an accident in your lifetime, they're death boxes, I give to
Amnesty International on the off chance that I'm ever imprisoned and
tortured for my political beliefs, paradoxically I have no political
beliefs, um Life is pain, black kids are cuter than white ones, I
didn't mean it when I compared you to our waitress I was only trying to
hurt you, I could've been meaner about your looks and what I would have
said would've made you cry, I have a towel I can't throw out because it
may have feelings, when I ejaculate I go into deep depressions, though
by any standard you're a nice person I deeply resent having to work
with you, I love Japanese monster movies, Gamera specifically..""

Ultimately, it's a love story told in a funny, quirky way and with
great performances by Billy Crudup, Tom Wilkinson, not to mention Bob
Balaban. Mandy Moore does a good job as well.",1213228800,5,2630,4.414432989690722
3045745,2,B00104AYFQ,"Like the central protagonist, this 2007 movie is a misbegotten mess. Making his directorial debut, actor Justin Theroux gets carried away with every film school trick in the book with self-conscious camerawork, annoying jump cuts and a music soundtrack that apparently has to comment on every scene. With a strangely cryptic first-time screenplay by David Bromberg, the movie boasts an impressive cast that includes Tom Wilkinson and Dianne Wiest, but it asks us to empathize with an obsessive-compulsive misanthrope whose actions alienate everyone around him. The ploy is too challenging since the character is more cruel than unfiltered, and his relentless bitterness rarely crackles with the wit necessary to get away with such boorish behavior. Moreover, subsequent attempts to humanize him feel increasingly contrived as the story progresses.

The story revolves around Henry Roth, a prickly, phobic children's book author (an intentionally ironic profession for such an uncaring jerk) who bonds only with his longtime collaborator, a curmudgeonly illustrator named Rudy. They finally achieve success with a book about Marty the Beaver's campaign to save Christmas, but then Rudy dies. Henry's poker-faced editor, Arthur Planck, wants a sequel and consequently hires a young artist named Lucy to take Rudy's place. Lucy has her share of problems - a mother who is also her landlord and willing to evict her, and an errant lover named Jeremy who wants her back after dumping her. The movie's title is derived from the dedication to Lucy in Jeremy's about-to-be-published book. Motivated by a large bonus offered by Planck, Lucy is willing to subject herself to Henry's nasty comments, but of course, a romance develops. This is where the film falters badly as the love story is sketchily developed with little discernible chemistry between the two stars.

The cast provides whatever redeeming value the film has. The usually audacious Billy Crudup does what he can as Henry, but it's an uphill battle. Better here than in last year's execrable&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Because-I-Said-So/dp/B000OCZA04/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Because I Said So</a>, Mandy Moore brings a certain poignancy to her scenes, but her downbeat character is so depressing that the only logical response to their romance is indifference. Wilkinson easily steals his scenes as Rudy both pre- and post-mortem, while Bob Balaban plays Planck in his typically low-key fashion. Wiest plays Lucy's mother in just a couple of tersely acted scenes, while Amy Sedaris, Peter Bogdanovich, Christine Taylor and Bobby Cannavale show up in cameos. The 2008 DVD is bereft of any extras, not even the theatrical trailer, which gives you an indication of what the studio thought of its prospects.",1204243200,8,2810,5.547785547785548
3045746,4,B00104AYFQ,"Billy Crudup plays Henry Roth, a children's writer who isn't sure what his next steps in life are. He is OCD and extremely cautious. He fears cars and isn't crazy about sex. He likes Japanese Monster films and harbors ill feelings for certain people in his life, especially women. Basically the only the he trusts is his illustrator (played by Tom Wilkinson) who dies right before their next book is supposed to be published.

This is where Lucy Reilly (played by Mandy Moore) comes in as a young illustrator on an emotional run from her ex-boyfriend/college adviser. She becomes Henry's illustrator and some where along the way we get hints as to why Henry is ""screwed up"" and the two fall in love. This is not a romantic comedy (even though it's listen in that drama). It is a story about two very real people and the importance of trust ... and how it must develop somehow before love does.

This story gets a four because it wasn't PERFECT but worth watching more than once. I was very excited to find that Mandy Moore didn't play her usual innocent and boring ""good girl"" role. But while she does deliver, don't expect anything fantastic. Of course Billy Crudup conveys his character beautifully.",1203465600,4,1201,4.687203791469194

""Dedication"", is a beautiful and heartfelt film tho, Justin Theroux makes a sensational directing debut. Fine performances from the always great Billy Crudup and the sweetheart only known as Mandy Moore. This is a film about redemption, loss and healing. Two lost souls who manage to find each other.

3045777,3,B00104AYFQ,"""Dedication"" tries to convince us that its central couple - charming-and-beautiful-with-emotional-baggage Lucy and grieving-misogynist Henry - are meant to be together. The problem, though, is that Henry is presented as merely quirky, but it's extremely obvious that, in addition to misogyny brought on by crippling depression, he has an undiagnosed mental disorder - a combination that has spelled doom for every single relationship he's had in the past. Even his best friend and writing partner can only deal with him in small doses. The movie's cause isn't helped by a mostly one-note performance by Mandy Moore. The direction is good, and the cinematography good-to-great. Overall, it's not a bad way to spend an evening, but there are definitely better ways out there.",1417478400,,773,5.344262295081967

3045823,1,B00104AYFQ,"This is worth neither the time nor the money.  Save yourself and skip this worthless piece of crap.

A story of a children's book author whose illustrator, maybe his father, dies of a brain tumor and throughout the movie comes back to rebuke the author.  Would that both died and stayed dead.  Throughout the movie there are flashes of light, as if from a flash gun, which serve no purpose other than to bother me.  When the illustrator dies the publisher hires a female illustrator to work with the misanthrope author and eventually they fall in love.

This film has been described by some as romantic comedy.  If you want romance and comedy for an hour and a half, try Macbeth, or Death of a Salesman, or Antigone, or Desire Under the Elms.  Not to mislead the reader I should say the writing of this is no match for Shakespeare, Miller, Euripedes or O'Niel.  But you will find these other works more romantic and a great deal funnier than this thing.

As if the movie were not bad enough the viewer must sit through 10 minutes of advertisements for other terrible movies.  These advertisemnets are actually the best thing on this dvd.",1386115200,,1137,4.579207920792079

But, the arc of his opening up to the possibility of love, trusting it and finally pursuing and accepting it, is worth the quirky ride.  The supporting characters, his partner, his agent and, finally Mandy Moore as his imposed illustrator, play their roles capably.  The writing has some exquisitely memorable lines - please hold out for ""Life is a skip for joy"" because, in context, it is an affirmation that makes this film what a movie should be:  challenging, compelling, a bit difficult in reaching the end but worth the ride.

Tom Wilkinson and Mandy Moore performed well, but both deserve better and should have insisted on more than this script and plot offered. This movie was neither romantic nor dramatic; it was just plain weird and surreal. It's easy to understand Crudup's character being attracted to Moore's character, but why Moore's character would be attracted to Crudup's eluded me.

3045845,2,B00104AYFQ,"Billy Crudup is damaged from childhood misery and OCD. He has no redeeming qualities and basically  hates everyone, including the children he writes for in his ""Marty the Beaver"" books .  It is hard to even feel pity for such a jerk.  He talks to his recently dead partner and piles heavy objects on himself to feel safe.  If this were a study in psychological disorders, it might get interesting.  No...it is attempting to be funny but is merely annoying.

Mandy Moore plays a messy illustrator, who despite a good education, has not found her way and lives off her mother's resentful dole. Her publisher forces her to work with Crudup to get him to finish his next Beaver book.  She also is considering whether to take back her now-successful, author-boyfriend who dumped her a year before.  There is a very thin plotline that he has dedicated his soon-to-be published book to her, in hopes this will  be the big gesture that earns him forgiveness.  But as a backup, he wrote the same dedication to another girlfriend, and is waiting until the last minute before publication to decide which girl gets the dedication.  Mandy is unaware of this, but Crudup finds out, and in his one kind gesture, resists telling her to spare her feelings.

Inexplicably, Mandy takes to Crudup after a brief couple of exchanges of not-clever repartee where he insults and demeans her. Suddenly, after looking at stars through a telescope, they kiss then hop into bed.  There is absolutely no chemistry between them and the script completely fails in creating any reason where this reasonably sane and pretty girl would find this nut-job appealing.  Unlike Helen Hunt in ""As Good As It Gets"", who is truly desperate enough to give Jack Nicholson's narcissistic character a consideration when he provides medical care for her child, Mandy is charmed by some rock Crudup gives her.  Yes, I get it that Mandy is the vehicle to ""save"" Crudup from his inner demons, but it just didn't work.  I wanted to yell at her, ""take the old boyfriend back"".  At least he looked reformable.",1329436800,3,2056,4.779036827195467

Henry an author is teamed up with Lucy, an illustrator, to work on a book for Marty the Beaver series.

It has been ages since I've watched a movie I didn't want to end - this is one of them! Probably not to everyone's taste but, I took a chance and just bought it never having seen it before and I'm glad I did - found something meaningful for a change.",1304640000,,544,4.396039603960396
3045849,5,B00104AYFQ,"Yes, this is a romantic comedy.  A romantic black comedy, but there are definitely elements of humor in it that any person will get.  Your mother finding your vibrator, the classic ""protagonist as an antagonist,"" and two people who loathe each other but truly have no reason to.

What some people might find unfavorable is the very bleak setting the movie has both visually and through both the writing and acting in the film.  Not surprisingly, the hilarity of this film comes from the seemingly tragic moments.  Billy Crudup as Henry Roth is excellent.  Finally, a character within a romantic comedy who is multi-dimensional, interesting, and I absolutely hate him.  He cures his fears by resting on his back and putting heavy objects on his chest.  He is someone who has no stable ground, someone constantly floating away from where he wants to be, but he continues his current path because it's all he knows and all he's aware of.  Rudy is his mentor and strangely both invites and rejects Henry's current situation.  He's a successful author of children's books, but what does that mean if he can't make any human connection?

Mandy Moore surpised me as Lucy.  At first she appeared a little too weak for Henry's character.  The scene of them in the restaurant and Henry comparing Lucy to the waitress was so beautifully offensive that it offended me.  But I think in that moment Lucy realized what she was working against and found that instead of being cruel to Henry (which is what he was used to), she would show him kindness instead.  This is what was different about the film to me.  A gut reaction from any human being in a moment like that is pure hatred, but Lucy took a different direction, and it was one that would change everything.

I think this is a film that gives great value to symbolism.  The rock that Henry gives to Lucy was both adorable and insulting.  It was something that he did for the dead as a sign of admiration and respect.  It was a thoughtful gesture but... it was for the dead.  And she kept the rock for what it meant to her.  He asked her about it and she mentioned that it looked like there was a little person looking up against it on the inside.  And it described Henry in a way.  He gave her that most vulnerable part of himself: his constant feeling of entrapment and angst toward the world.

This film is not for those looking for a ""feel good"" comedy.  This film makes you think about relationships and what they mean to each person.  It makes you evaluate and is smartly done.  It's the romantic comedy for those who hate romantic comedies.",1286928000,4,2589,4.557483731019523

3045861,2,B00104AYFQ,"I learned of this movie accidentally, really, looking for info on Mandy Moore. I made a point to check it out eventually, which I did tonight.

Billy Crudup portrays Henry, a misanthropic children's book writer with more than his share of idiosyncrasies. After his illustrator (played by Tom Wilkinson) dies, he's partnered with Lucy (Moore), who agrees to work with Henry after being offered a substantial amount of money to do so. Henry's abrasive and non-endearing behavior inhibits Lucy from the start, and makes for an extremely uncomfortable working environment. Given the fact that they have less than a month to produce a complete book, this adds to their predicament.

The script to this movie, I found disjointed. At no point did I ever believe that Lucy could ever be attracted to Henry. While I did like the back-and-forth approach between the surrealistic and absurdist angles to telling the story, as well as the returns to reality, this movie just never gets too far off the ground. I thought it was well-directed, but the actors can only do so much with the bad script they were given to work with.

Crudup does a great job at making you dislike his character, and Moore shows significant acting growth from her earlier roles (which, in my opinion, mirrors the musical growth she has displayed in recent years, coming from a bubblegum pop past). I hope that she continues to challenge herself, acting-wise. She really has the talent for it, and this was a great role for her. It's just too bad that the movie itself is forgettable.

I wanted to like this movie a lot. The bottom line is that I didn't.",1263081600,,1617,4.764285714285714
3045862,4,B00104AYFQ,"Interesting big city tale with the great looking Mandy Moore, and Billy Crudup as a typically messed up writer. A rich writer, which they don't tell you, but you have to deduct by his posessions. The storyline is sometimes a little hard to follow as to why he or she did what, but it is sometimes fun and also sometimes sad, and sometimes stupid. Not really believeable, but what is funny is how Mandy in real life married a guy 2 years later, who in someways, is like Billys character type. I guess the power of love links strange mates at times. Good acting by all in it.",1260316800,,573,4.314814814814815
3045863,5,B00104AYFQ,"It's rare very rare in these days to explore forgiveness and grace when you are speaking of romance.  The persona of both the main characters in the love interest here Mandy Moore and Bill Cudrup are excellent choices by the casting crew.

Both of them are extremely suited for their roles, Bill Cudrup as the product of a typical abusive childhood and Mandy Moore as the product of a ""normal"" childhood.  Immediately the audience can relate to two personal emotions in this romance, frustrated manhood for Henry Roth (Cudrup) and unrequited love for any young woman Lucy Reilly(Moore) great hair.  Cudrup is great because even if he is socially handicapped he remains attractive (think James Dean) and Moore is of course the wonderful girl next door.

The antiheroes that keep popping up are the alter egos of Bill's character and Mandy's old rotten boyfriend Jeremy.  The ex boyfriend Jeremy is everyone's ex boyfriend who could not or would not be the man he was meant to be.  Jeremy keeps for selfish reasons trying to get back to the place he was before, proving that brilliance as a writer does not make you smart or likeable.  Lucy Reilly has moments with her overanxious and over bearing mother played quite convincingly (dianne Weist)and with perfect timing.  Through the interestind scenes all Lucy never loses her ability to love or to maintain her own dignity more importantly her sense of self in the plot.  It is not cloying but timely, and you can see how the lovers begin to long for each other as they walk into their love scenes.  Even without overt chemistry but with thorough acting they accomplish a believable romance between Henry and Lucy.

Although the movie is rated R it is thankfully not for explicit sexual content but more for foul language.

Yes there is still for many people a sense of propriety.  You can look at romance as something that happens between two people or you can choose to look at it as something that happens on a much higher level.  It is the level just above the heart, the one that chooses to be good for another person as the expense of ones self.  You can easily and naturally see this in Mandy Moore's character which attracts men to her like a magnet, and you can see it in Bill Cudrup as he dares to leave his mental obsessiveness for the one love he ""can"" long for.

The only people that could hate this movie are the ones that have been made perfectly cynical by life.  Given the crude nature of romance in Hollywood these days it is not suprising that this was not much bigger at the box office the sound track is very well done for anyone in their 20's.

The plot makes out another guy to be worse than Billy because he wrote two dedications to his pending book, one for Mandy Moore and one for another girlfriend, depending on which one takes him back.

The main male character is a victim of child abuse who never faced it, instead developing various obsessive compulsive behaviors in order to make him so busy with minutiae (like arranging napkin and sugar dispensers at the restaurant) that he is too busy to heal. He spends who knows how much time searching for a special rock that he gave to the female lead and then threw away, eventually finding it among the myriad stones of the beach. While some symbolism may be intended, is giving her the rock supposed to be his cathartic experience and now everybody lives happily ever after? The female lead, whose posture indicates more a need for therapy and Pilates than a relationship, gets to choose between a man who cheated on her and one whose emotional scars leave him emotionally unavailable unless she enjoys navigating the pits and falls of his damaged emotional landscape. A dreary miasma of moral relativism, substitution of co-dependency, and celebration of victim-hood as a replacement for self-actualization and love.",1220832000,3,1217,5.0
3280241,5,B00104AYFQ,"Henry Roth (Billy Crudup) writes books for children all the while
suffering from the ramifications of a childhood with a missing father
and an abusive, probably violent, mother. He has a bit of an OCD
problem as well.

His mentor, best friend, and parent replacement, is Rudy Holt (Tom
Wilkinson), who illustrates Henry's books. When Rudy dies, Henry is
devastated. He keeps imagining seeing Rudy, thus continuing to let
'Rudy' tell him how to handle Life. Something Henry is not very good at
at his own.

He is teamed up by his publisher Planck (Bob Balaban) with a new
illustrator, Lucy (Mandy Moore). In the beginning, he treats her like
he would anybody else, which means mean, but it becomes very clear that
she is a nice person and quickly he begins to like her. But he doesn't
know how to break the habit of being strange and sarcastic. (Anybody
who's been shy and hurt knows that being rude or weird is a perfect way
to stay safe; to keep people away from the core).

Here is what he tells her in one long hilarious monologue which
conveyed by the brilliant Billy Crudup comes out exasperated,
hesitantly and too fast all at the same time and with a voice that is
nearly broken , due to the fact that he has realized that he's told her
far too much:

""I hate my mother I hate my goddamn dead father more, Rudy was the only
friend I ever had, I had a girlfriend once who I used to like to
masturbate to more than have sex with, carrots and snakes frighten me
um I'm superstitious about the numbers (3. 5. 7) I can only stir things
counter-clockwise and I know that if I don't something bad will happen,
I take a size 11 and a half shoe I don't have a favorite book, I don't
drive or ride in cars, statistically speaking you have a 100% chance of
being in an accident in your lifetime, they're death boxes, I give to
Amnesty International on the off chance that I'm ever imprisoned and
tortured for my political beliefs, paradoxically I have no political
beliefs, um Life is pain, black kids are cuter than white ones, I
didn't mean it when I compared you to our waitress I was only trying to
hurt you, I could've been meaner about your looks and what I would have
said would've made you cry, I have a towel I can't throw out because it
may have feelings, when I ejaculate I go into deep depressions, though
by any standard you're a nice person I deeply resent having to work
with you, I love Japanese monster movies, Gamera specifically..""

Ultimately, it's a love story told in a funny, quirky way and with
great performances by Billy Crudup, Tom Wilkinson, not to mention Bob
Balaban. Mandy Moore does a good job as well.",1213228800,5,2630,4.414432989690722
3280242,2,B00104AYFQ,"Like the central protagonist, this 2007 movie is a misbegotten mess. Making his directorial debut, actor Justin Theroux gets carried away with every film school trick in the book with self-conscious camerawork, annoying jump cuts and a music soundtrack that apparently has to comment on every scene. With a strangely cryptic first-time screenplay by David Bromberg, the movie boasts an impressive cast that includes Tom Wilkinson and Dianne Wiest, but it asks us to empathize with an obsessive-compulsive misanthrope whose actions alienate everyone around him. The ploy is too challenging since the character is more cruel than unfiltered, and his relentless bitterness rarely crackles with the wit necessary to get away with such boorish behavior. Moreover, subsequent attempts to humanize him feel increasingly contrived as the story progresses.

The story revolves around Henry Roth, a prickly, phobic children's book author (an intentionally ironic profession for such an uncaring jerk) who bonds only with his longtime collaborator, a curmudgeonly illustrator named Rudy. They finally achieve success with a book about Marty the Beaver's campaign to save Christmas, but then Rudy dies. Henry's poker-faced editor, Arthur Planck, wants a sequel and consequently hires a young artist named Lucy to take Rudy's place. Lucy has her share of problems - a mother who is also her landlord and willing to evict her, and an errant lover named Jeremy who wants her back after dumping her. The movie's title is derived from the dedication to Lucy in Jeremy's about-to-be-published book. Motivated by a large bonus offered by Planck, Lucy is willing to subject herself to Henry's nasty comments, but of course, a romance develops. This is where the film falters badly as the love story is sketchily developed with little discernible chemistry between the two stars.

The cast provides whatever redeeming value the film has. The usually audacious Billy Crudup does what he can as Henry, but it's an uphill battle. Better here than in last year's execrable&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Because-I-Said-So/dp/B000OCZA04/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Because I Said So</a>, Mandy Moore brings a certain poignancy to her scenes, but her downbeat character is so depressing that the only logical response to their romance is indifference. Wilkinson easily steals his scenes as Rudy both pre- and post-mortem, while Bob Balaban plays Planck in his typically low-key fashion. Wiest plays Lucy's mother in just a couple of tersely acted scenes, while Amy Sedaris, Peter Bogdanovich, Christine Taylor and Bobby Cannavale show up in cameos. The 2008 DVD is bereft of any extras, not even the theatrical trailer, which gives you an indication of what the studio thought of its prospects.",1204243200,8,2810,5.547785547785548
3280243,4,B00104AYFQ,"Billy Crudup plays Henry Roth, a children's writer who isn't sure what his next steps in life are. He is OCD and extremely cautious. He fears cars and isn't crazy about sex. He likes Japanese Monster films and harbors ill feelings for certain people in his life, especially women. Basically the only the he trusts is his illustrator (played by Tom Wilkinson) who dies right before their next book is supposed to be published.

This is where Lucy Reilly (played by Mandy Moore) comes in as a young illustrator on an emotional run from her ex-boyfriend/college adviser. She becomes Henry's illustrator and some where along the way we get hints as to why Henry is ""screwed up"" and the two fall in love. This is not a romantic comedy (even though it's listen in that drama). It is a story about two very real people and the importance of trust ... and how it must develop somehow before love does.

When the illustrator dies the publisher hires a female illustrator to work with the misanthrope author and eventually they fall in love.

Tom Wilkinson and Mandy Moore performed well, but both deserve better and should have insisted on more than this script and plot offered. This movie was neither romantic nor dramatic; it was just plain weird and surreal. It's easy to understand Crudup's character being attracted to Moore's character, but why Moore's character would be attracted to Crudup's eluded me. Character development is important to a good movie, along with a good script and direction. This movie offered little or nothing on those fronts. It was just BAD!",1370304000,,672,5.118181818181818

3280342,2,B00104AYFQ,"Billy Crudup is damaged from childhood misery and OCD. He has no redeeming qualities and basically  hates everyone, including the children he writes for in his ""Marty the Beaver"" books .  It is hard to even feel pity for such a jerk.  He talks to his recently dead partner and piles heavy objects on himself to feel safe.  If this were a study in psychological disorders, it might get interesting.  No...it is attempting to be funny but is merely annoying.

Mandy Moore plays a messy illustrator, who despite a good education, has not found her way and lives off her mother's resentful dole. Her publisher forces her to work with Crudup to get him to finish his next Beaver book.  She also is considering whether to take back her now-successful, author-boyfriend who dumped her a year before.  There is a very thin plotline that he has dedicated his soon-to-be published book to her, in hopes this will  be the big gesture that earns him forgiveness.  But as a backup, he wrote the same dedication to another girlfriend, and is waiting until the last minute before publication to decide which girl gets the dedication.  Mandy is unaware of this, but Crudup finds out, and in his one kind gesture, resists telling her to spare her feelings.

Inexplicably, Mandy takes to Crudup after a brief couple of exchanges of not-clever repartee where he insults and demeans her. Suddenly, after looking at stars through a telescope, they kiss then hop into bed.  There is absolutely no chemistry between them and the script completely fails in creating any reason where this reasonably sane and pretty girl would find this nut-job appealing.  Unlike Helen Hunt in ""As Good As It Gets"", who is truly desperate enough to give Jack Nicholson's narcissistic character a consideration when he provides medical care for her child, Mandy is charmed by some rock Crudup gives her.  Yes, I get it that Mandy is the vehicle to ""save"" Crudup from his inner demons, but it just didn't work.  I wanted to yell at her, ""take the old boyfriend back"".  At least he looked reformable.",1329436800,3,2056,4.779036827195467

Believe me if Henry (Billy Crudup) was ugly nobody would tolerate his behavior. That being said, this is an unusual but touching love story. Henry an author is teamed up with Lucy, an illustrator, to work on a book for Marty the Beaver series. It's touching because Henry slowly realizes that he wants to trust another person and is willing to face his fears for Lucy. However, will that really last once the novelty wears off?",1318032000,2,584,4.416666666666667
3280345,5,B00104AYFQ,"What a beautiful movie - not one of those typical Hollywood mass-market aimed, block-buster romantic comedies but a more down-to-earth, realistic movie about two people finding each other and leads you to believe that their love is real - not just a happy end for the sake of happy-end movies. It has been ages since I've watched a movie I didn't want to end - this is one of them! Probably not to everyone's taste but, I took a chance and just bought it never having seen it before and I'm glad I did - found something meaningful for a change.",1304640000,,544,4.396039603960396
3280346,5,B00104AYFQ,"Yes, this is a romantic comedy.  A romantic black comedy, but there are definitely elements of humor in it that any person will get.  Your mother finding your vibrator, the classic ""protagonist as an antagonist,"" and two people who loathe each other but truly have no reason to.

What some people might find unfavorable is the very bleak setting the movie has both visually and through both the writing and acting in the film.  Not surprisingly, the hilarity of this film comes from the seemingly tragic moments.  Billy Crudup as Henry Roth is excellent.  Finally, a character within a romantic comedy who is multi-dimensional, interesting, and I absolutely hate him.  He cures his fears by resting on his back and putting heavy objects on his chest.  He is someone who has no stable ground, someone constantly floating away from where he wants to be, but he continues his current path because it's all he knows and all he's aware of.  Rudy is his mentor and strangely both invites and rejects Henry's current situation.  He's a successful author of children's books, but what does that mean if he can't make any human connection?

Mandy Moore surpised me as Lucy.  At first she appeared a little too weak for Henry's character.  The scene of them in the restaurant and Henry comparing Lucy to the waitress was so beautifully offensive that it offended me.  But I think in that moment Lucy realized what she was working against and found that instead of being cruel to Henry (which is what he was used to), she would show him kindness instead.  This is what was different about the film to me.  A gut reaction from any human being in a moment like that is pure hatred, but Lucy took a different direction, and it was one that would change everything.

I think this is a film that gives great value to symbolism.  The rock that Henry gives to Lucy was both adorable and insulting.  It was something that he did for the dead as a sign of admiration and respect.  It was a thoughtful gesture but... it was for the dead.  And she kept the rock for what it meant to her.  He asked her about it and she mentioned that it looked like there was a little person looking up against it on the inside.  And it described Henry in a way.  He gave her that most vulnerable part of himself: his constant feeling of entrapment and angst toward the world.

This film is not for those looking for a ""feel good"" comedy.  This film makes you think about relationships and what they mean to each person.  It makes you evaluate and is smartly done.  It's the romantic comedy for those who hate romantic comedies.",1286928000,4,2589,4.557483731019523

3280358,2,B00104AYFQ,"I learned of this movie accidentally, really, looking for info on Mandy Moore. I made a point to check it out eventually, which I did tonight.

Billy Crudup portrays Henry, a misanthropic children's book writer with more than his share of idiosyncrasies. After his illustrator (played by Tom Wilkinson) dies, he's partnered with Lucy (Moore), who agrees to work with Henry after being offered a substantial amount of money to do so. Henry's abrasive and non-endearing behavior inhibits Lucy from the start, and makes for an extremely uncomfortable working environment. Given the fact that they have less than a month to produce a complete book, this adds to their predicament.

The script to this movie, I found disjointed. At no point did I ever believe that Lucy could ever be attracted to Henry. While I did like the back-and-forth approach between the surrealistic and absurdist angles to telling the story, as well as the returns to reality, this movie just never gets too far off the ground. I thought it was well-directed, but the actors can only do so much with the bad script they were given to work with.

Crudup does a great job at making you dislike his character, and Moore shows significant acting growth from her earlier roles (which, in my opinion, mirrors the musical growth she has displayed in recent years, coming from a bubblegum pop past). I hope that she continues to challenge herself, acting-wise. She really has the talent for it, and this was a great role for her. It's just too bad that the movie itself is forgettable.

I wanted to like this movie a lot. The bottom line is that I didn't.",1263081600,,1617,4.764285714285714
3280359,4,B00104AYFQ,"Interesting big city tale with the great looking Mandy Moore, and Billy Crudup as a typically messed up writer. A rich writer, which they don't tell you, but you have to deduct by his posessions. The storyline is sometimes a little hard to follow as to why he or she did what, but it is sometimes fun and also sometimes sad, and sometimes stupid. Not really believeable, but what is funny is how Mandy in real life married a guy 2 years later, who in someways, is like Billys character type. I guess the power of love links strange mates at times. Good acting by all in it.",1260316800,,573,4.314814814814815
3280360,5,B00104AYFQ,"It's rare very rare in these days to explore forgiveness and grace when you are speaking of romance.  The persona of both the main characters in the love interest here Mandy Moore and Bill Cudrup are excellent choices by the casting crew.

Both of them are extremely suited for their roles, Bill Cudrup as the product of a typical abusive childhood and Mandy Moore as the product of a ""normal"" childhood.  Immediately the audience can relate to two personal emotions in this romance, frustrated manhood for Henry Roth (Cudrup) and unrequited love for any young woman Lucy Reilly(Moore) great hair.  Cudrup is great because even if he is socially handicapped he remains attractive (think James Dean) and Moore is of course the wonderful girl next door.

The antiheroes that keep popping up are the alter egos of Bill's character and Mandy's old rotten boyfriend Jeremy.  The ex boyfriend Jeremy is everyone's ex boyfriend who could not or would not be the man he was meant to be.  Jeremy keeps for selfish reasons trying to get back to the place he was before, proving that brilliance as a writer does not make you smart or likeable.  Lucy Reilly has moments with her overanxious and over bearing mother played quite convincingly (dianne Weist)and with perfect timing.  Through the interestind scenes all Lucy never loses her ability to love or to maintain her own dignity more importantly her sense of self in the plot.  It is not cloying but timely, and you can see how the lovers begin to long for each other as they walk into their love scenes.  Even without overt chemistry but with thorough acting they accomplish a believable romance between Henry and Lucy.

Although the movie is rated R it is thankfully not for explicit sexual content but more for foul language.

Yes there is still for many people a sense of propriety.  You can look at romance as something that happens between two people or you can choose to look at it as something that happens on a much higher level.  It is the level just above the heart, the one that chooses to be good for another person as the expense of ones self.  You can easily and naturally see this in Mandy Moore's character which attracts men to her like a magnet, and you can see it in Bill Cudrup as he dares to leave his mental obsessiveness for the one love he ""can"" long for.

The only people that could hate this movie are the ones that have been made perfectly cynical by life.  Given the crude nature of romance in Hollywood these days it is not suprising that this was not much bigger at the box office the sound track is very well done for anyone in their 20's.  It's Hollywoods loss, and highly recommended.",1251504000,2,2661,4.611464968152866

3280364,3,B00104AYFQ,"Billy Crudup plays a misanthropic self-hater full of obsessive quirks that make no sense and that turn him into an extraordinarily unlikeable schmuck. Therefore, the film makes no sense in its attempt to redeem him with Mandy Moore playing his baby-talking foil. His relationship with his late father appears to be his central reason d'etre, but that makes no sense either. The plot makes out another guy to be worse than Billy because he wrote two dedications to his pending book, one for Mandy Moore and one for another girlfriend, depending on which one takes him back. Got it? In the end, this film is annoying, but it is certainly not the lightweight romantic comedy you figure it is from the packaging.

As usual, Crudup walks away with every scene. (And if Tom Wilkinson is in a film, you know it's worth a look.) As Henry, Billy's monologues are worth the price of admission. You get a sense that Crudup is slumming here and could do this part in his sleep, but he's very funny. Mandy Moore is the weakest link here, though in her defense, he part was pretty slim.
