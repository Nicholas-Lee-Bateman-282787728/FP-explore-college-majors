8250930,4,B0013H5QYO,"My husband, who cycles to and from work but does not do yoga aside from this DVD, gives it four stars. The program takes a yoga-for-athletes approach--very much what a personal trainer at the gym might offer were s/he to become yoga certified. The routine provides an overall body stretch with a slight focus on cycling muscle groups.",1421798400,,334,4.775862068965517

8250932,5,B0013H5QYO,I like this DVD for stretching out after a run or bike ride.  It is very relaxing and does the trick quickly.,1343779200,,109,3.9545454545454546
8250933,4,B0013H5QYO,"This isn't a DVD for hard core yoga users. It's more of a basic workout DVD for cyclists who specifically want to help ameliorate some of the more unpleasant after-effects of cycling. It also provides great pre and post ride workouts. For what it is, it's darned near perfect. It does the job, and provides a glimpse into the world of yoga, which can be so much more.",1326499200,3,367,4.411764705882353
8250934,5,B0013H5QYO,Love the DVD. Clear instructions and easy to follow along.  Great stretches before and after a road bike ride.,1212537600,10,110,4.7894736842105265
