1883491,5,B00009KP1N,"This movie was shown on TV quite awhile back over the course of 5 days (I believe).  Patty Duke and Martin Sheen are excellent in it.  This movie is based on a true story and is well worth seeing and then seeing again and again.  HOWEVER, this movie needs to be on DVD format for audiences in the USA.  I know I will buy it the minute I see it's finally available.",1185062400,16,364,4.013888888888889
