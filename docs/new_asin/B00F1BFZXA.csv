5963021,5,B00F1BFZXA,"I actually already have the season one pass for this. I got it on a whim and couldn't believe how great the show is! To be clear, this is a British show aimed at 8-12 year olds. I fall way out of that range, but as a junior high ESL teacher, I'm always looking for fun, age-appropriate videos that my kids will like when we have some extra time. Each episode is about 25 min without commercials, and the subject matter is generally light and fun while dealing with many of the issues faced by teens. I showed one episode to my ninth graders and they loved it. I'm planning to buy the season one box set, and truly hope that season two will be available in the US soon!",1383091200,8,668,4.1461538461538465
5963022,5,B00F1BFZXA,"Wolf blood is awesome and the animation for the wolfs are amazing.

5963023,3,B00F1BFZXA,"When I heard about this show, I read that it was intended for kids of middle-school age.  I watched the first couple episodes and didn't care too much for it.  My initial issue with the show was the audio.  It seems like british shows don't have audio as crisp as we are used to.  Either that, or it may have to do with the way my brain interpreted the accents of the various characters.  Parts of what I watched were a bit predictable, but then I'm not really the intended audience.  My two girls (8th and 9th graders) absolutely love this show.  Me?  I could watch it if it's on, if only for the different angle on a Wolfblood (not the same as a werewolf).",1382659200,4,658,4.208
5963024,5,B00F1BFZXA,"I watched an episode of this out of curiosity, and found myself almost immediately drawn into it.  Despite the fact that it's a CBBC show (for youths 8-14, I think, I'm not really sure) I suspect that most folks who like Buffy would like this.  In certain ways it reminds one of Buffy, Willow and Xander (and a few different candidates for Cordelia) in the early years.

As it is aimed at a younger audience, there's no sex and little violence, but the show is quick moving, and like Buffy at the best of times, I'd find myself both laughing out loud and misting up a bit during various episodes.  Series One is now playing on Disney in the US, Series Two will have its finale tomorrow night in the UK, with no word yet as to whether there will be a Series Three.  I hope they do, it quickly became one of my favorite shows.

Update:  After Series Two ended, there was an announcement that there will be a third series, though I don't think it will be out till September or so of 2014.",1382227200,26,985,4.263440860215054

5963029,2,B00F1BFZXA,I suspect some of the episodes on this DVD and other DVDs of this show have been edited out. A grievance in which I go into more detail here --> (  http://amzn.to/2keCZfj ). This DVD in particular has a glitch that takes place at 0:10:30 when Maddy approaches Shannon at her locker to find out if she's okay. Whether or not this is just a glitch or a bad re-edit remains to be seen. Has anyone else noticed this problem?,1484956800,,420,4.25

5963035,5,B00F1BFZXA,"This show is for not just teens or kids. Any adult can appreciate Wolfblood, which handles some mature themes in subtle, effective ways and throws in a good amount of humor during each episode. Maddy Smith and Rhydian Morris are two of the most interesting young characters and their acting is also really well done, especially as the show progresses. You can see how much these characters care for each other, get on each other's nerves, etc., and the storyline is fascinating as you watch the core group of characters (Tom, Shannon, Emma, Daniel, etc) make really tough decisions about keeping the wolfblood secret and what that means. For anyone who has ever felt that they weren't 'normal' enough for the world around them, this show really resonates. It also handles the animal-wolf theme in a fascinating realistic way that outperforms a lot of werewolf stereotypes.",1468195200,,872,4.97945205479452

Try this out and I think most sophisticated people will love it for older kids.",1453334400,,302,4.490909090909091
5963041,4,B00F1BFZXA,"The main characters are Maddy Smith, Rhydian Morris, Tom Okanawe,and Shannon Kelly.

The wolves in this series aren't werewolves of human legends.  They're known as Wolf Bloods, they become full wolves - not hybrids of wolf and human. . The Full Moon does force their transformations.  They're bound to the moon, strongest at the Full, and powerless on a Dark Moon.  Between Dark and Full, they can change at will.  They're born with the ability and can't turn humans.

Maddy's parents are Wolf Bloods.  They'd told Maddy much about her people, but also kept her ignorant of the darker aspect of them.  Her whole life Shannon and Tom had been her only friends.

Shannon believes in a  legendary monster that lives in the woods.  At the end of the season, she and Tom finally learn the that Maddy's family were the source of that legend.  They vow to keep the secret.

In the pilot Maddy was approaching her first turn.  Then Rhydian moves to town.  He been raised by humans, in the foster care system.  He hadn't been prepared for being a wolf.  Unlike Maddy,  Rhydian had already turned a few times.  They bond quickly.

Throughout the season they explore what it means to be Wolf Bloods.  Learning of Wild Wolf Bloods and of Wolfs Bane.  They sneak out for a few Full Moons.  They don't become a couple this season, but it's clearly what both want.

The woodland landscape is so beautiful. Many episodes have Maddy, Rhydian, Shannon and Tom out in the woods.  Others have Maddy and Rhydian running through the Wild in Wolf Forms.

This season was Maddy's.  In her Veins Wold Bloods Flows.",1452643200,,1590,4.646209386281589
5963042,5,B00F1BFZXA,"A whole season of adorable Aimee Kelly!

Aimee's character, Maddie Smith, is a girl who inherits the ability to turn into a wolf - not a werewolf - and her adventures in High School trying to keep that ability secret.  Sort of an inverted Buffy where the girl who can turn into a wolf - is the hero and exposure is the threat.

Aimee and her co-star Bobby Lockwood were both nominated for Children's BAFTA awards - with Bobby winning - so someone besides me (who is obviously biased) thinks she (and Bobby) can act.",1448841600,,515,4.4

I just wanted to chime in by saying my kids -8 and 10- and my husband and myself....we love love love this show. It's clean and decent,  the kids are great actors and it's interesting.  We are right now at the end of season 2 on Netflix but the kids love it so much they have asked me to buy the whole series to keep.  We are enjoying it so much, I am going to. I saw someone compare it to something off mtv. That's untrue. It's nothing like that trash.  There's no adult innuendo or sex or bad language..nothing like that. There's an innocence to it that's like a British leave it to beaver....lol....ok, maybe not, but you know what I mean.  We highly recommend for a family series.",1423094400,,773,4.1610738255033555

5963061,5,B00F1BFZXA,"The only thing I could complain about is Aimee Kelly's photograph on the case. For some reason the photo makes her look stiff. If you haven't watched Wolfblood yet, trust me, she looks much better on video. As the series starts, 14 year old Maddy Smith, (portrayed by the aforementioned Ms. Kelly) is dealing with having parents who change into wolves every full moon, while trying to survive being one of the unpopular kids in the British equivalent  of high school (University?) Plus there's a new boy in school who can also transform into a wolf. Later in the season, Maddy, and her parents have to deal with her first transformation into a wolf. Being able to turn into a wolf seems to bring out a mischievous side to Maddy that was something of a surprise to me, but probably shouldn't have been. after all, she is a teenager, facing a situation that that she expected to happen, but was totally unlike anything she had ever experienced before. It's a fun journey, and if you enjoyed reading Spider-man, especially the early Spider-man written by Stan Lee, you'll like this, too. Come along for the ride.",1419724800,,1109,4.687179487179487
5963062,3,B00F1BFZXA,"The best description of this show would be a G-Rated version of MTV's Teen Wolf. The very young cast are surprisingly good actors. Bobby Lockwood and Aimee Kelly have real chemistry and draw you into the show. But  the stories are very juvenile. Clearly this is made for young kids, never touching on ANY real teen issues the way Degrassi High has done. You feel like you are watching grade-schoolers and not high-schoolers. Now toss in some of the worst CGI wolves to ever hit the screen and BAM! You'll get the idea.
Oh, I almost forgot the vanishing clothing. Okay, the boy Wolfblood  is wearing a hoodie, with an army jacket over it, thick pants and boots. He transforms into a wolf and POOF, there are NO CLOTHES. No heap of clothes on the ground, no wolf crawling out of a pile of clothes, just vanished clothes. Then to make matters worst, when he turns back to human, he is fully dressed. Okay, so I don't expect nudity but...really? No sex, no blood, no gore, and only the most childish scares.
WARNING: If you have trouble understanding accents then pass this one up. The accents are very heavy here and the DVD does NOT have subtitles (but Closed Captions are available.)
The stories are very basic. Wolfblood girl has this secret and must hide it from her friends. Her best friend, in seemingly every episode, almost finds out about her, but then is put off track by mechanization from the Wolfbloods. Throw in a little teenage angst stemming from bullying, to bad grades, divorced parents, inattentive father, or whatever G-Rated problems the writers can come up with, and you already understand this series.
Great show to watch with kids looking to sample the supernatural genre,  but this may bore more seasoned viewers.",1419724800,,1735,4.7194719471947195

The fact that a family of werewolves are shown taking on life so matter of fact common place like is interesting in itself.  Fold in all the normal elements of children coming of age and this show is both profound and funny.  Wolf Blood is not huge on special effects but they are good enough to get the story told effectively.

The video and audio quality was very good 8 out of 10 with ten being perfect.  This is a British production so you must be fluent in BritSpeak to get the most out of the conversations and jokes. The locations are often awesome.",1415750400,,712,4.356060606060606

5963082,5,B00F1BFZXA,"Wolfblood is one of my guilty pleasures as it is a British show and I love British programs. Even though is for teenagers, it can be watched by adults too as the theme of wolves is one theme that many adults enjoy. This show has teenage actors who are doing a very good job in the show-they look seasoned and mature in doing this show as well as adults who are seasoned actors. The show is being presented in a not so dark and edgy atmosphere-it has its moments of humor. Also, one of the reasons I love British shows, is that some controversial themes are presented in a very mature and responsible way-no as disgusting as some shows here in the USA. Also, I have noticed, that the male lead is not being used for his looks only but because he can act  and he is not so exploited as to his sexuality as it is happening with the hundreds of male actors here in USA. Very good show, very entertaining.",1410825600,11,900,4.232558139534884

5963088,4,B00F1BFZXA,"Wolfblood turned out to be different than I expected.  At first I wasn't sure what to think, but as the season progresses, the understanding of what wolfbloods are comes into focus.  They're not werewolves.  They're born wolfbloods, not bitten or transformed in any way.

Since this is a BBC production, all the characters have accents, which can be initially difficult to understand.  The only major downside to the show is that it's only a 30 minute TV program.  The plot development would be better if the show were actually an hour program.

The actors weren't great at the beginning, but as the show progresses, they seem to come into their characters better.  The school drama is pretty much the same as all the other teen school shows, but the added twist helps to bypass the cooklie-cutter drama.

I suggest watching a few episodes before passing any judgement.  Give the plot and characters time to develop.",1403740800,3,916,4.851612903225806

5963095,5,B00F1BFZXA,"Here's an example where a show aimed at young adults is far better than anything you'll see aimed at the 18+ set. The story has a novel concept and the acting is top notch, with characters that are multidimensional rather than know-it-all sassy teenagers or clueless parents. The show also doesn't follow the usual stale formulas or tropes. Please, Amazon, put Season 2 up fast!",1396915200,2,378,4.8307692307692305
5963096,5,B00F1BFZXA,"I love this ""Disney-like"" story of two British teenagers who find out they are wolfbloods  when they come of age.  (Wolfbloods are born that way unlike werewolves who are bitten to transform.)  They go through many different difficulties keeping their secret of changing to a wolf on full moon nights.  No one knows but their families, at first.
The shows are done well for young children and last a half hour.  No extreme violence shown for the most part.  There's young love but no kissing or sex shown.  The live scenery is beautiful.
I first saw it on the Disney channel.
The only negatve of the show is that it is only season one.  I hope there will be a season two!",1396310400,2,671,4.442622950819672

5963098,5,B00F1BFZXA,I had to get two of these. My aunt loved watching the show when I turned it on tv. I figured she would like it. I really enjoyed this show when it was on. So I kept one of the DVD's also. Really good show/DVD to watch.,1395964800,,218,3.6595744680851063

5963104,5,B00F1BFZXA,"Maddie and her family are wolfbloods, the correct term for werewolves.  Unlike wild wolfbloods, she and her family live largely in the human world.  At the start of the series, Maddie has yet to make her first transformation.  Maddie's best friend is a science geek, who firmly believes that the local woods are the haunt of a previously unknow ""beast"" she is fanatically determined to discover and document.  Maddie's life becomes even more complicated when another woldblood, Rhydian, shows up at school as the foster child of a local family.  Rhydian is much more of a wild wolfblood than Maddie and her family, and is a potential danger to them as he is a trespasser on their territory; he is also perpetually angry and rebelling.  The series revolves around Maddie's attempts to integrate Rhydian into her pack, to keep her human friends from discovering their secret and to grow into an adult wolfblood herself.  The series is well scripted and acted, and is suitable for adults and children alike.  Can't wait to see Season 2!",1393113600,,1033,4.862857142857143

5963110,4,B00F1BFZXA,"I rarely look at the Disney Chanel so I missed this when it was aired. I was pleasantly surprised by this sweet tale of two teenage werewolves in which the trait is inheirited. Even though this is very obviously England, the appeal is universal. Maddy is on the verge of being able to change to a full wolf when  Rhydian, a boy who has moved from family to family in the system starts at her school, the first wolfblood her own age she has ever known. Over the season the mythology behind the the tale is slowly developed. Interaction with Maddy, her parents and  Rhydian are complex and feel normal. I'm looking forward to season 2.",1390435200,2,633,4.448275862068965

8611448,5,B00F1BFZXA,"Wolfbloods are such an under represented minority.  I love that they are so well represented here.  My young daughter is part Wolfblood.  Little Grandma is all Wolfblood, Big Opa found her during the Korean Conflict.  He gained her trust and eventually they had a daughter Christine.  Big Opa tells the story of bring her over on the big C-17 planes.  He had to build a wall of suitcases and cargo to keep her and they're new born cubling from the rest of the plane. Understandable they split after many years. Big Opa to his credit is still very close to Little Grandma, he even knows more about Wolfbloods than Little Grandma.  She's lost most of her wolf.  Thier daughter gave birth to my best friend and wife.  Who in turn gave me my little cubling Kimojo.  Finding Wolfbloods culture in the Idlewild of San Antonio is ""challenging"", which is which why I'm so happy to find this show!  My cubling struggles.  She's painfully shy outside our home.  I call her my tamerous beast but no one understands why.  Until recently she would growl at strangers that spoke to her.  Only being herself with her ""Uma"".  Watching the show has helped her feel more comfortable with herself and her wolf.  I highly recommend this show to anyone that struggles with thier wolf.",1521417600,,1263,4.642533936651584
