5732982,4,B00CPR3RB0,"Mention ''Naked City'' to aficionados of old TV shows and they ALWAYS refer to the 60-minute format. Despite Sterling Silliphant's fine writing, the first, 30-minute, season would never be remembered had it been cancelled then. The original actors just didn't have the chemistry Burke, McMahon and Bellaver achieved in the final three seasons, and the 60-minute shows featured far, far better guest casts than did the 1st season. The 2nd-4th seasons should have been released at a much cheaper price with the first season left to bootleggers.",1377475200,5,542,5.241379310344827

5732984,5,B00CPR3RB0,"It's hard to overstate just how good this series was, or what a time capsule it is.  Another triumph for creator Stirling Silliphant.  For me, growing up in New York City around that time, the series genuinely chronicled the streetscape - physical, people, relationships, drama and, occasionally, comedy.  When the scenes were shot on location, there was no better show before or since.  (If all of Kojak had been filmed the same way, that great series would have been greater still.  And Telly Savalas argued exactly that point.)  I've enjoyed the earlier Naked City DVD releases and am looking forward to this set.  I just hope that Image does it all just beyond the act of releasing the series - plural - in their entirety.  Standing by.  A release date would be nice to know, too.",1371859200,13,784,4.705882352941177
5732985,5,B00CPR3RB0,"There are 8 million stories...At long last...NAKED CITY is going to be released COMPLETELY on November 5th of this year (2013)...with ALL 39 half hour episodes from 1958 and ALL 99 hour long episodes from 1960 - 1963....CHECK OUT THE FABULOUS ART WORK !!!!

Naked City...New York City...the place where a landmark police TV series (based on the 1949 film The Naked City) was produced by Herbert B. Leonard.  The series with so many great guest stars...Dustin Hoffman, Gene Hackman, Robert Redford, Carroll O'Connor, William Shatner, Burgess Meredith, Robert Duvall, Ed Asner, Suzanne Pleshette, Eddie Albert, Robert Culp, Steven Hill, David Janssen, Rip Torn, Eli Wallach, Peter Falk, Claude Rains, Telly Savalas, Leslie Nielsen, Nehemiah Persoff, Jack Lord, Walter Matthau, Malachi Throne, Dick York, Alfred Ryder, Mitchell Ryan, Jack Klugman, Keenan Wynn, Dennis Hopper, Barry Morse, Brett Somers, Roddy McDowall, Martin Balsam, Frank Sutton, Hume Cronyn, Lee J.

The 1958 episodes star John McIntire as Lt. Dan Muldoon and James Franciscus as Detective Jimmy Halloran (shown on extreme bottom left looking at DVD package front side) while the 1960-1963 episodes star Horace McMahon as Lt. Mike Parker, Paul Burke as Detective Adam Flint and Harry Bellaver as Detective Frank Arcaro (shown on extreme bottom middle looking at DVD package front side).  Really giddy for this set now that the release date and Art Work are now available.

Not only does the beauty of late 50s early 60s New York City appeal to viewers...not just the many great guest stars appeal to viewers...but the hard hitting stories from the mind of Stirling Silliphant and his many varied talented writers yield many different stories about people in the Naked City from all walks in life.  From the rich and famous to the ordinary every day Joe on the street...eccentrics...business men...syndicate members....business owners...those that struggle to make ends meet...tourists...immigrants...cops...politicians...poets...sailors...painters...professional sports figures...engineers...military veterans...professional hit men...men on death row...you name it...find their way into the drama that is...NAKED CITY.

Some of the absolute best hourly episodes not previously released will come with this set such as ""The Deadly Guinea Pig"", ""Killer With A Kiss"", ""Without Sword and Stick"", ""Bridge Party"" and ""A Corpse Ran Down Mulberry Street"".

Don't let this set pass you by.  Lawrence Dobkin's narration of the hourly shows is superb and sets the proper mood for the hourly drama.  Nelson Riddle's ""Naked City"" theme (for the hourly show)..is outstanding.  The show, theme and narration for Naked City are five stars and then some.",1369094400,84,3759,5.741007194244604

5732987,4,B00CPR3RB0,"Time magazine was right in calling this ""Not just another cop show!""  The 138 episodes (complete 4 seasons) are packed with human interest stories and great guest stars.  Their names are like a Who's Who of Hollywood.  And speaking of nostalgia, special features include some of the original TV commercials.  (Where the hell have the years gone?)  This TV show certainly belongs in your permanent DVD collection.  My only complaint is the sound track.  It could use a re-mastering.  The voices are O.K., but silence would have been better than the blaring noise that passes for musical background.

There's great acting and a lot of famous guest stars (usually before they were famous), but what really separates this from other tv shows is the filming on location in New York City. This tv show was way before I was born, but I loved seeing how NYC looked like in the late 50's and early 60's. TV shows today are so generic, bland, and sterile in comparison.

5733003,3,B00CPR3RB0,"The stories can't be matched by today's television standards, so I am not rating the compelling characters or the captivating stories contained here. I am however rating the redistribution of the series by RLJ Entertainment. I will first start off by saying that I was shorted 2 discs in this 29 dvd set. My season 2 contained two disc 1's and two disc 2's rather than a disc 3 & 4. I called RLJ, but they told me to contact the seller. I have yet to go to Amazon about it, so I'm not upset - yet. That alone would have cost a star, but I save another one due to the poor quality of the picture. My expectations were not too high on the digital remastering of these episodes, so I'm really not being overly particular. Watching these is like viewing them as they were viewed in the day of the tube tv. The picture is over contrasted or washed out. I get that some of this may be unavoidable due to the camera equipment used and the fact that most scenes were shot on location rather than a set. I understand that this series was one of the first of its kind to do such and the quality of the recording was therefore less controllable as a result given the state of the technology then. But, even the disc menu screen is pixelated  and minimal. The publisher (or whatever) was obviously in a rush to get this set up for sale. It has a ""boot-leg"" look and feel all the way around. However... I love this series like I loved every episode of Route 66 and Dragnet. There's no compare to the depth of these stories and the peek back in time to that style-rich clarity of culture prior to the storms or revolution. They had their issued, (sure, what generation doesn't), but they acted on theirs with a sharp articulation. At least they did there on the tube. :)",1466985600,,1756,4.289156626506024

5733013,3,B00CPR3RB0,"Bought this for the husband, and this is my review as we work our way through the second season. Although Naked City is missing the language, nudity, and much of the blood and gore of current procedural shows, it is not lacking in darkness. Part of this is due to the nature of the series. Each episode features the cops (and by half way through the second season we're starting to really like them and they're starting to jell well with each other) and a special guest star who gets to play the bad guy. These are quality actors they're bringing in as guest stars, so, for better or worse, each plot revolves around the villain. And these villains are frequently seriously damaged people. Some are inherently evil, driven by greed and various lusts. Others are victims of poverty, ignorance, warped family dynamics, oedipal complexes (Whoever wrote these had studied their Freud), etc. The result is a well done show which none-the-less tends to wallow the corruption of the soul of man. A little relief is had in the sober camaraderie of the three main cops (and the main cop's fiance). It is a show well acted, but for the most part a ""feel good"" type show it is not.
Just for reference, other old shows the husband enjoys more than Naked City include The Fugitive and Peter Gunn, and of newer shows Blue Bloods. M Squad was about on par with Naked City, slightly less dark but with poorer picture quality.",1439424000,4,1409,4.595238095238095
5733014,5,B00CPR3RB0,"In the history of Screen Gems' produced TV series in the late 50s and early 1970s,before being changed to Columbia Pictures Television,no other TV series can be anywhere as successful or enjoyable,as the old ABC-TV series,""NAKED CITY""  in it's heyday,Screen Gems,before being reinstated as a
motion picture division for Sony in 1999,was among the most well known suppliers of both Primetime and syndicated TV shows-and ""NAKED CITY"" is
among many of their most prized titles,from it's library! Paul Burke,who,along with Horace McMahon,Harry Bellever,and Nancy Malone,may she seriously rest in peace,were the series' regulars,as each week on ABC,many of the Naked City's citizens,were played by Hollywood's very elite core,who were
guest stars back then,climbing the ladder,that would eventually lead them to acheive critical success in their careers! but for the lovers of pure,vintage TV
back in the day,when all it took,was great scripts,great acting,and great guest stars,""NAKED CITY"" is certainly worth the time and money! and,,next to ""ROUTE 66"",another prize Screen Gems title,""THE NAKED CITY"" gave ABC-TV some great viewing years,before Paul Burke took to the skies,in ABC's
""TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH"" TV series in Fall 1964,from master TV producer Quinn Martin!  watching these episodes,were also worth the time,as the exploits of Detective ""Adam Flint"",sometimes took him into areas of serious criminal matters,to heart warming and humorous moments-even to see Jean Stapleton,years before ""ALL IN THE FAMILY"" made her a household name,was certainly worth every viewing moment! i recommend ""NAKED CITY"" to only the most serious lovers of great vintage TV,who'll find greater appreciation in watching this show,and it's impressive guest stars,to see how far they've come in their careers,when they did time,working on this series! special mention to the late Nancy Malone,who played ""Libby"",Adam Flint's girlfriend-this actress later became a producer,mostly for ABC's ""THE BIONIC WOMAN"" series in 1976,and was also involved with Twentieth Century Fox Television as a vice president (subject to correction) in the mid late 1970s. Malone was the finest actress of her kind,and truly a great talent! this DVD set is worth the money,and viewing enjoyment,as it was once one of ABC's top rated shows of the early 1960s-in fact,some of these episodes also includes vintage TV commercials,along with the old ABC logo,before they changed it in 1963,up to the very present,,a great journey,back in TV's past!",1439164800,2,2501,5.578947368421052

5733019,5,B00CPR3RB0,"I had been hearing about this series for decades. Then a few months ago the new ""Decades"" nostalgia network ran a ""series binge"" of hour-long episodes. I tuned in to one of them and was amazed. I watched about ten of them and remembered details long afterward -- how often can you say that about today's TV episodes?

Only later did it occur to me to look for DVDs; I had never seen them on the rack back when there were still retailers in New York City that sold CDs and DVDs. And here they were -- the Complete Series. And I discovered that the first season was 39 half-hour episodes, with James Franciscus (whom I knew as ""Mr. Novak"" a few years later), not Paul Burke, and the amazing John McIntire, not Horace MacMahon, as the lieutenant. (He quit in mid-season to pursue other opportunities.)

The great success of the series can be attributed to the writing of Stirling Silliphant, the directing of a small very talented group who found ways to expand the TV medium out of the studo, and stunning cinematography.of the often long-gone cityscape. (There was one fleeting glimpse of a Penn Station interior that gives a better hint of what was lost than entire movies that were set there.) In later seasons Silliphant is credited as ""script consultant.""

I've just finished the first season. They hadn't yet attracted the top-rank guest stars who peopled the hour-long episodes, but there were already a few people who would go on to be big names. The final episode provides a plausible explanation for Franciscus's character to not return in the second season. I'll be interested to see whether and how they explain his disappearance in the first episode of the second season. (The loss of McIntire was handled quite conventionally.)",1436832000,2,1739,4.751655629139073

Harry Bellaver has never gotten his due for the great job he does as Sgt. Frank Arcaro. When all the other actors seem a little stilted with delivering their lines from time to time, Bellaver is relaxed and fully believable in his role. Every word and sentence rolls out as completely natural. Stirling Silliphant's early writing can be overly portentous at times but he manages a depth to the stories that doesn't always rely on formula. Of course, it is a wonderful treat to see the early appearances by a huge number of actors who later became household names. And the location shots and settings of late 50s and early 60s New York City are a record of a great American city long gone now.",1428537600,3,851,4.568627450980392

5733028,5,B00CPR3RB0,"Naked City is still relevant more than 50 years after the series ended.  The show was a crime drama that, like the Defenders (and more recently, Law & Order) raised issues that invited  the audience to think and form opinions.  For example, in one of the shows the detective must go to witness the execution of a prisoner.  The script explored the detective's troubled feelings about the death penalty.  In another show, a murderer was re-tried because it was discovered that he had a brain tumor that affected his behavior at the time of the crime.  The state and defense attorneys made compelling arguments and the jury's verdict was not announced at the end of the show.  Great script!  The purpose was to get the audience to think about the issue as if sitting on the jury.

The show was on the air from 1958 through 1963.  The black and white filming was just fine and there were many nice New York location shots throughout the series.  Also, the series had guest appearances from many excellent character actors of the time.  It's always a pleasure to see someone like Martin Balsam in a role.

Television has always had its share of quality shows and junk.  With the growth of cable television and the need to fill in program schedules, there seems to be a proliferation of inferior programming, such as many of the reality shows.  During the 1950s and 1960s, there were three major networks: CBS, NBC and ABC.  The Dumont network died in the 1950s and UHF did not grow until the mid-1960s.  During this period, if you missed a show, you'd never see it unless it was shown as a rerun during the summer because there was no way to record the program on tape or disc.  So, it's gratifying that some of the older shows are now being released on DVD.  During those years, there were some excellent dramas, such as Playhouse 90, Studio One, Armstrong Circle Theater, U.S. Steel Hour, and so on.  I view Naked City as one of the better dramatic shows, given the quality of the scripts and the acting.  Now, if someone could license and release The Defenders.......

5733041,5,B00CPR3RB0,"Naked City is arguably the prototype for reality-based police drama. Not only are the story lines excellent and acting wonderful, the cinametology is stunning. Filmed in black and white on the streets of Manhattan and the Bronx, the series is a time capsule of what New York looked like and maybe even how it felt like during the late 50's and early 60's. The grime and grittiness on the streets conveys the lament of many people today who long a return to the ""authentic"" New York of years past. You also get a sense of the many social issues being raised during that particular time period.

The series has a long list of young guest actors who continued on to fame and fortune. I imagine that Naked City introduced many of these actors to the public for the first time. As with most highly respected television series, there are a few dud episodes here and there but overall, Naked City is a remarkable landmark which I highly recommend viewing.",1407369600,4,948,4.609467455621302
5733042,5,B00CPR3RB0,"You can label this entry as a preview rather than a review:  I just placed an order with Amazon Prime for ""Naked City"", the complete series, and look forward to its arrival.  As a kid who grew up in Mississippi, I remember this ""cop show"" on black and white TV and loved it. Many, many years later, I took a job with the New York Post as a sportswriter and fell in love with the Big Apple.  The ""love affair"" lasted only three years before I returned to Dixie.  Yet, my memories of NYC linger still; it's hard to stay away.  I introduced my wife to New York, and she too fell in love with the city.  Over the past 17 years we have spent five summer vacations in NYC, and I look forward to watching ""Naked City"" to see how much the city has changed since the series was filmed.  A scrutiny of the long list of actors who later became superstars in Hollywood left me incredulous.

5733045,2,B00CPR3RB0,"This is really bad.

Sure, we now get every episode of this intriguing show, but we are forced to trade complete-ness for VISUAL QUALITY:
WHY??!

The previously released episodes by IMAGE were excellently mastered, with clean, crisp image quality. But now, these SAME EPISODES have been re-released as part of this new complete set, and look LOUSY by comparison-- the SAME episodes that IMAGE was able to clean up beautifully.

Who or what is RLJ, and why have they visually trashed these episodes? Isn't the beauty of digital  technology the fact that the visual quality doesn't deteriorate during duplication?? So why couldn't RLJ acquire the same restored masters that IMAGE had released, and at least give us THOSE episodes in their re-mastered condition? Now I am forced to either:

a.) keep the older (excellent) IMAGE dvds on my shelf for better visual quality-- ALONG WITH the new complete set or:
b.) ditch the IMAGE versions to save shelf space, and accept CRAPPY visual quality from RLJ's complete set

This is really bad.

The new RLJ shows episodes are DARK, MURKY and often pixilated-- a sure sign of slow duplication speed, a great way to cut corners on quality. The opening interior move theater scene of ""Daughter I am in My Father's House"", which looked fine on IMAGE, now looks like a 4th-generation hack job. WHY??  RLJ gives us 4 Hour-long episodes on a single DVD, just as IMAGE did.

The urban glories of gritty, '60's NYC now look blurry and fragmented by comparison with IMAGE's versions; the panoramic establishing shots that looked so gorgeous on Image are now pixilated and choppy.  Overall, RLJ's visual quality is akin to that of the archival World War II documentaries that can be seen at all hours on the History Channel.

But-- that's the price we pay for completeness, I suppose. Had the beautiful IMAGE remasterings not existed, I'd be satisfied with RLJ's new set, assuming that no better source materials could be found. But that's clearly not the case.

REALLY, REALLY BAD. Shoddy, unacceptable quality-- which we are forced to accept for the sake of preserving this fine series.

5733056,5,B00CPR3RB0,"For a 1950's era police drama the Naked City was about as real as it gets.  It all starts with a movie of the same name, THE NAKED CITY!  The movie was splendid and sets the tone for this Naked City DVD set. I'd strongly suggest you buy the Naked City Movie because; yes its that good.  The people are real and the twists and turns are enough to blow your mind.  I can't give you any spoilers because; the Naked City is too good to ruin it for you in any way.

These Naked City episodes unfold peoples lives right in front of you.  If you love film noir you will adore the Naked City.  While some of the classic noir lighting heavy with creepy shadows is at times absent there is a definite noir quality to most Naked City episodes. The big shadow ladden dark streets of New York or the imposing spooky interiors of old buildings barely lit inspire the imagination to run amuck as murders and other crimes happen all around you.

Peoples lives unravel in front of you and likein classic noir you often get to see otherwise good rich people behaving badly.  Equal time is given to otherwise good poor and middle class people behaving in manners most beastly.  The Naked City does not descriminate each episode is an opportunity to look under a rock to see what manner of criminal or crazy crawls out. The Naked City is more than a precedural Crime Drama.  the Naked City is a time capsule taking viewers back to the idealized Leave It To Beaver 1950's and showing that life was not always really the wholesome milk and cookies, apple pie sitting on the window sill peaceful conservative pundents romantize.

The Naked City shows the bare truth exposing the best and worst of our humanity in 50 minute snippets.  I have the 2 or three sets of the Naked City heretofore available.  Now with this I have all the episodes of the Naked City and I feel tremendously blessed to own them. There are few DVD sets I can recommend more than the Naked City. If you love film noir, Law & Order or just a good mystery your collection will not be complete without this Complete Series of the Naked City.",1397606400,2,2087,4.387012987012987

5733059,5,B00CPR3RB0,A gem! I really enjoy all the old NYC scenes.  (My husband likes the cars.)  The show is loaded with great character actors whom we've seen through the years. It is very well written and the stories are somewhat realistic. The main characters are all likable (unlike a lot of the shows that are out now). A must for your DVD library if you're a fan of noir films.  Some of these shows are good enough to stand alone as noir films.  You will NOT be disappointed!

5733062,5,B00CPR3RB0,"I remember watching 'Naked City' in the early 1960's and together with 'The Defenders' it represented for me the best of American television drama at that time.  Watching it again after more than 50 years the series still has power although it can't have the same impact it had then - we're both more than 50 years older.  But if, like me, you saw the series when you were both young I think you'll get a lot of pleasure from watching the shows again.  And they'll remind you, perhaps, how good it felt to be 19 and 20 all those years ago....",1394236800,4,542,4.294117647058823
5733063,5,B00CPR3RB0,"For those unaware, Naked City is a police drama series which aired on ABC from 1958 to 1963. In all there were 39 half hour episodes and 99 hour long episodes. It boasts a cast which, over the years, featured  James Franciscus,  John McIntire, Paul Burke, Horace McMahon, and Harry Bellaver as police detectives in the NYPDs 65th Precinct, This anthology series from Stirling Silliphant, who went on to great fame with the series ROUTE 66 and the film IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT, was groundbreaking. Not totally corny, as you would possibly expect a television show that ended over 50 years ago, the acting is great and the stories are compelling.

As most of the shows of this era, it boasts a stunning array of then little known or unknown talent who show up throughout the run. Included in that last are such luminaries as Gene Hackman, Rod Steiger, Dustin Hoffman, Robert Duvall, Peter Fonda, Alan Alda, Carroll O'Connor, Jean Stapleton, James Caan, Robert Redford, Jack Lord, Ed Asner, Martin Sheen, Dennis Hopper, Martin Balsam, Telly Savalas, Christopher Walken, Robert Blake, Bruce Dern, Peter Falk, Jack Klugman, Suzanne Pleshette, William Shatner and so many more. And the list of established stars also reads like a who's who, with everyone from Eddie Albert to Keenan Wynn and much of the alphabet in between making appearances.

The transfer is good and now that the price has dropped under a C-Note, I jumped at the chance to add it to my library, where it sits proudly next to ROUTE 66. By the way: the episode ""Four Sweet Corners"" served as a sort of pilot for what became ROUTE 66.",1393545600,2,1596,4.73021582733813
5733064,5,B00CPR3RB0,"WOW, what a simply fantastic show. Definitely beats Law & Order by a mile (and I love me some SUV). Every single episode is stunning-- simply beautiful shots of NYC in the 1950s, with real NYers going about their business on the streets.

The stories are wonderful, intense, and sometimes heart-wrenching. They're SO real-- stories about ordinary people and their ordinary (and extra-ordinary) circumstances, people stuck in situations beyond their control. And they're creative-- not the same old plot lines re-hashed again and again. And sometimes the stories include some good old-fashioned cop/bad guy shoot outs, and sometimes run-ins with the Mob (and I swear some of the Mob stuff must have influenced David Chase's The Sopranos).

The cops themselves (Adam, his girlfriend Libby, Frank, and Mike) are wonderful characters, who you really see develop over the course of the show. Adam's a sort of good-hearted sociologist kind of cop, Frank is an all around good guy, and Lt. Mike is wonderfully stubborn and soft at the same time. Their interaction with everyone that their police work puts them in contact with is filled with so much humanity. I dare you not to be truly touched by every episode.",1393545600,5,1205,5.050251256281407
5733065,5,B00CPR3RB0,"Not that it isn't great from the beginning, but greater still when it expands to an hour. I don't agree that James Franciscus is too young for the role (as the authors of one book claim); he does fine, though Paul Burke seems more seasoned. I guess both Franciscus and John McIntire did not want to work in New York and that's why they left or didn't return. Only Harry Bellaver stayed through the whole series. Viewers beware, if you get too attached to McIntire's Lt. Muldoon, he gets killed off a little past midway in the first season. Horace McMahon is excellent as his replacement. Easy to compare to Kojak in some ways.",1392854400,,626,4.5
5733066,5,B00CPR3RB0,"Bought this from Amazon when first released late last year. I am happy to finally own the complete series on dvd. My short review is typed only now, because I finally saw all 4 seasons. I will keep all my best of NAKED CITY dvds, because of all the commercial spots included in those sets. This boxed set only comes with a few. The video and audio on this complete series set isn't bad for a series in b/w from the late 50's, early 60's. The night segments do look a bit dark in some scenes, but it's okay with me. It's probably my favorite dramatic series of all time. I used to watch the series in the late 70's here in local NYC TV. I'm glad the half hour season is included. I highly recommend this. Great cast, amazing guest stars and NEW YORK CITY one of the major reasons to watch. A NYC that's changed so much, including the demographics and ethenicity of the city. I was born here in the city and live here all my life so I know how much has changed. A better time then.",1392249600,2,979,4.130890052356021
5733067,5,B00CPR3RB0,"Finally,the entire series is released on this DVD collection instead of a few chosen episodes over the four-year run.
I could not find anything much wrong with the picture quality. A few grainy episodes but nothing to complain about.
This was an excellent series. Probably, the first of it's kind to be shot on location on the streets of New York instead of in the studio. The first season are the 30 minute episodes before they took it to the hour -long format in season 2. The first season starred John McIntire from ""Wagon Train"" and ""The Virginian"". James Franciscus from ""Longstreet"" the TV series where he played a blind Private Eye, plays the young sidekick and Harry Bellaver plays Detective Arcaro which he would play throughout the entire series. John McIntire and James Franciscus would not continue their roles with McIntire's character being killed off halfway through season one. Maybe the first time that a main character on a series would be killed off.
The second season would see Horace MacMahon as Lt Parker and Paul Burke as Adam Flint joining the show for the rest of it's run. High production values with intriguing story lines and a cast of well known names as well as new ones that became household names like Dustin Hoffman and Robert Duvall would appear.
There are some kooky episodes where you wonder what the writers were thinking when they wrote them but the majority are brilliant. Even the shows that are not that great will hold your attention with the guest stars. One episode has William Shatner from ""Star Trek"" playing a burmese sailor. His accent has to be heard to be believed or maybe not.
Below follows some of the episodes that are my personal favourites:

Season Two

DOWN THE LONG NIGHT
Leslie Nielson [The Naked Gun] plays a man hounded by another man who blames him for the death of his family. But did he do it and why?

TAKE AND PUT
A funny episode to end season two. A story of a once well to do family who have fallen on hard times and their maid who steals for them.

5733068,5,B00CPR3RB0,"The handful who have complained about the inclusion of the first season in this boxed set imply that the original half-hour series and the hour series are two different animals.  A number of inaccuracies have been floated here, including describing the first season as a shoot-'em-up affair and saying that Harry Bellaver's Acaro is a patrolman.  Well, the first season has the same format of character study over wall-to-wall action, with the same (perhaps even more) emphasis on poetic omniscient narration...and Acaro is a Detective Sergeant.  Bellaver even gets co-starring billing on the last several first-season episodes, when McMahon's Lt. Mike Parker gets benched, possibly for being so unsympathetic.  McMahon doesn't even get cast credit in the last two first-season episodes.  (He does appear earlier, during the McIntire period as a plainclothes cop who may be Mike Parker).

The first one-hour episode is a direct continuation of the format the half-hour show.  The sets are the same, many familiar actors from the first season appear, the director (John Brahm) is a veteran of the half-hour show and the script is by Stirling Silliphant, who wrote most of the first season.  McMahon's Parker is back (almost surprisingly) but already the actor and screenwriter are giving him more shades of humanity.  Paul Burke is essentially playing the same role that James Franciscus did -- the actors even resemble each other.  The first two-thirds of the first season were dominated by John McIntire's humanistic Dan Muldoon, with Franciscus' Halloran often secondary.  The last third of the first season has Franciscus in the lead, with top billing, and establishing the format that the hour shows would follow.  It's fairly obvious that had Franciscus been available, he'd have continued, too.  Both actors were good in, again, what was essentially the same young, earnest detective role.

No question that the hour shows had (obviously) more room to breathe and apparently bigger budgets.  But it's the same show, with the same wealth of NYC actors.  In ""A Death of Princes,"" Peter Falk (unbilled) doesn't survive through the opening scene, and Clifton James, Ann Miner and numerous other familiar first-season faces turn up.  Eli Wallach is the guest star, but also on hand is George Maharis (soon to be riding Silliphant's ROUTE 66).  Maharis appeared in three first-season episodes, all major roles.

The transfers are spotty on season one, but don't skip them.  There's no question that the first season has its ups and downs, and losing McIntire in the still disturbing episode ""The Bumper"" caused the series problems.  But in working out those problems, the format for the later hour series was developed.",1390089600,4,2719,5.190366972477064

5733073,5,B00CPR3RB0,"I shelled out the money to buy the entire Naked City Box set because 1) I  remembered the show as a small child (but was too young to understand or appreciate it), 2) watched a few episodes on late night television (1:00 am) while in college which kept my interest enough at that hour to keep me from falling asleep and the episodes I saw were quite memorable from what I remember 3) I explored the show more recently in the last ten years via its availability on DVD rentals and really enjoyed what I saw.  4) residing near the NYC area and working there for a few years can really make you appreciate the program.  Therefore, when I found out the entire series would be released in a box set, it was a no brainer because I was anxious to see episodes I have not seen yet.  Plus, I never saw any of the half hour episodes !

I  wasn't disappointed in buying this.  Print is quite clear for a show that is 50+ years old and enough episodes I have not seen yet to warrant the purchase. Story lines in the show are ageless themes.  Some of the episodes I remember as being so good, I actually watched over again before moving on the ones I have not seen.  Nothing comes close to this on television now.  if you have never seen this program before,  episodes I recommend you save for last because they are unforgettable:  ""NY to LA"", ""C3H5 (NO3)3, ""The Wednesday Night Story"", ""Which is Joseph Creeley"", Case Study of Two Savages"", ""Lament for  Dead Indian"" ,  ""The Rydeker Case"", ""Daughter, Am I in My Father's House, ""Kill me While I'm Young so I can Die happy"", ""A Horse has a Big Head, let Him Worry"", "" Bringing Far Places Together"", ""Barefoot on a Hotbed of Coals"".  This is just an excellent sampling of the 1 hour shows and I have not seen the half hour episodes yet.

The box set is a must purchase if you appreciate television classics from the 50s and 60s and if you have ever lived or worked in NYC (or have an appreciation of old Pontiacs !)",1388534400,7,1951,4.275204359673024

The remaining hour shows are all lesser quality, transferred from prints at least a generation or two down the line, and in two or three cases quite damaged-looking. The first-season half hour shows are likewise less than perfect, with high contrast on most episodes and a couple of really poor prints.

So it could be better. But equally its shortcomings shouldn't be exaggerated.

The show itself? A genuine classic, that gains enormously from being presented complete and in order - especially the hour series, which develops from a conventional police show into an anthology series like no other before or since: sometimes melodramatic and sentimental, sometimes funny and hip, sometimes plain weird.

Having now watched all 39 half hour episodes and all 99 hour episodes, I can say that---while not digitally restored-----all episodes are quite watchable.  In fact for most of the episodes, the prints are really quite good.  One of the half hour episodes---""The Sandman"" was somewhat fuzzy and maybe three or four of the hour episodes had some minor damage.  But over all, the prints are quite nice.

My only reasons for giving 4 and not 5 stars is the packaging. The plastic spindles (holding in place the ""plates"" which secured each disc) snapped in two the four disc sets plastic boxes.  I figured it was less aggravating to find replacement blank multi disc plastic packages on my own than to go through the aggravation of returning the entire set.

5733084,5,B00CPR3RB0,"Finally, the complete set in one package. I was a kid when the series aired and never watched it until the hour shows were broadcast on a local network in 1984.  I was fascinated to glimpse the city in which I grew up depicted as it looked when I was nine or ten.  There are more stores instead of chains, and even the chain stores like Rexall Drugs and Horn & Hardart automats are gone from modern New York but alive in The Naked City of 1962.  The shows were liked short plays with great monologues that the actors must have love.  And dig those episode titles:  ""A Horse has a Big Head.  Let Him Worry.""  That's longer than an average line of dialogue in today's fast-paced word of TV shows cum video games cum Internet short attention span information spurts.
 Yes, it's disappointing as other reviewers have commented, that features from previous collections such as episode titles on discs, summaries, bumpers for commercials and many of the original commercials are not included.  I think the people who put the materials together could have included a booklet with episode synopses and a brief history of the series from Weegee's book to the 1948 movie, and the transition from half-hour to hour TV show. How hard would it have been to do a bonus 20-minute special with some of the people who guested or loved the series?  Well, the market for Naked City apparently does not merit these goodies or putting subtitles on the shows.  But at least it's regular DVD and not DVD-R as they have done with Alfred Hitchcock presents Season Six.  The bottom line is that the quality of most of The Naked City prints is good if not excellent, and face it, you can't find official episodes in syndication on TV or for sale or on streaming as you can with more popular show such as Star Trek or Have Gun Will Travel.  (Some websites sold Naked City TV series as common domain sets, but I can't vouch for the quality.) Add that this package is available for about $80, and it's a fine deal for a brilliant show.  If the sales are good enough, we can dream of a definitive set, remastered, in blue ray, with commentaries, etc.  There are 8 million reviews on Amazon.

Yes, we now have have the full NAKED CITY series on DVD. But the picture quality, and sound quality in some, is awful. The distributor seemed to have just rounded up whatever prints rightsholder Sony had and put them to disc. Unfortunately many shows, especially in low light scenes, act like your 7 megapixel camera and are very noisy and grainy. Others are pristine. yet others show they were copied from some form of videotape - and have the dropouts to prove it. Content: I never saw the half hour versions until I opened the set. They're very derivative of the original THE NAKED CITY film, down to the names of the two main characters ... Glad ABC retooled the series last three seasons into hour shows - quality acting ... Get to see young actors such as Robert Redford, Dustin Hoffman, others familiar on the small screen like Carroll O'Connor, Jean Stapleton, Ed Asner and Peter Falk. One of my favorite episodes featured a chase through the old Penn Station, another set outside Yankee Stadium 1.0. Get the set - but only at a discount.

Unfortunately the DVDs are not Excellent so far.  I have only just looked at the first season so far and the quality is poor, some episodes are so dark or over contrasty  that they are for unwatchable. Definitely not up to the standard that Image Entertainment would have offered. Now RLJ run this company I feel the quality has dropped.  Also the cases are a bit poor, one of my cases arrived broken, not through transportation I think but because of poor quality.  Hopefully the DVD quality will get better. I do feel that the ones done earlier by Image are superior. I'll be a bit careful next time in choosing RLJ products",1384905600,30,792,4.43448275862069
5733088,4,B00CPR3RB0,"Am I sore about Image Entertainment's sporadic, disorganized, and incomplete offerings over the years?  Yes.  Are the prints and transfers of these episodes always great?  No, a few seem to be derived from poor/damaged stock.  Most are perfectly acceptable though.  Hardly ""unwatchable"".  And at the end of the day, THIS is what we Naked City fans have been waiting for - and we got it!  In sequential order.  Complete.  Even the groovy episodes without Martin Landau, Telly Savalas, etc.

What REALLY impressed me though is Amazon's handling of my pre-order.  I initially signed on for the $99 introductory price, which to me was a bargain already, but apparently Walmart was selling them for $25 so Amazon voluntarily and without me even having to do anything price-matched.  Tickled pink about that.  That really boosts buyer confidence and trust in this vendor.

EDIT:  A few remarks on Season 1.  Another reviewer actually slams RLJ/Image for including Season 1, as though worthless, quipping they should have ""left it to the bootleggers.""  Like a good deal of fans, I started viewing Season 2, at first ignoring the much maligned 1958-59 half hour episodes.  I had no idea what I was missing!  Some of these are fine examples that can hold their own against the respected one hour episodes.  In a few cases, I was astounded at how the writers crammed so much story into 25 minutes.  It's actually nice to get a break from the frequent insertion of Adam and Libby Chatting at the Cafe scenes.  If you don't believe me how good season one can be, watch ""Sidewalk Fisherman"", and be amazed.",1384560000,5,1593,4.843866171003717
5733089,5,B00CPR3RB0,"Long awaited, Naked City: The Complete Series is the dream collection for any fan of this well-written and well-acted show, but there are a few minor inconveniences that can be addressed - although none are a major detraction to the overall quality of the series in this DVD collection.

A couple of the episodes of the first season starring James Franciscus and John McIntyre are from grainy prints.  Evidently, pristine source material was not available, and rather than deprive us of those episodes it's understood that we must settle for this compromise in visual quality.

However, since Disc Five of Season One has only the final four episodes on it, there was sufficient space on the disc to include episode bumpers, more original commercials (there's just a scant few at the end of the series - certainly not a true overview of the spots used during all four broadcast seasons) and network promos.

A booklet detailing the show's history could have covered it's inspiration from the 1948 Jules Dassen film production to development as a half-hour series mirroring the movie's opening and main characters [Veteran Lt. Muldoon and rookie detective James Halloran] through it's cancellation, then re-birth as an hour-long series with Paul Burke as Detective Adam Flint and Horace McMahon as Lt. Parker.

A background anecdote could have told newcomers to the series of John McIntyre's desire to return to his Western ranch home, and how his character was killed off a little past midway through the first season [in the episode ""The Bumper""] and how Lt. Parker was transferred to the 65th Precinct as his replacement... as well as how Parker and Detective Arcaro (Harry Bellaver) are the only two original characters to return in the hour long revamp.

A list of guest stars by episode would have been nice, along with episode synopsis.  Image did that for the 10 DVD, 40 episode collection, but not for a 29 DVD collection with a list price of $179.99.

Image Entertainment (and their parent company RLJ Entertainment) seem to have dual purposes in their releases.  They reissue classic TV programming to fill fan desire, but put little care into their physical packaging or package print content.

My set arrived in a flash from Amazon, but Disc Five, Season One was off its hub and scratched.  I contacted RLJ directly only to find they ""no longer have a customer service department"" and that the seller needed to get me a replacement.  They dumped the responsibility on Amazon - who came through like champions - but have to eat extra shipping charges because RLJ only want to sell DVDs, not offer customer service as do other disc companies (including the much maligned but customer-friendly Mill Creek Entertainment).

In fact Image/RLJ has had other interesting issues in the past.  I had to scrap a fairly new DVD player and buy a replacement for it because their Twilight Zone Complete Collection was disc-authored in such a way that the audio tracked perfectly but the image locked, jumped and stuttered on some machines but not others.

Their Perry Mason packages have had either flip page hub or spindle breakage and good luck if you need a replacement case...  should you be able to find just a single one for sale, it can cost you a pretty penny.

That said, I repeat that these were minor issues worth addressing, but not enough to dissuade the true fan of ""Naked City"" from enjoying the complete series.  For enjoyment, it's Five Stars all the way.  Let's be honest, if we rated DVDs just on the way they were packaged, judging by many hard-core collectors' rants... most all disc manufacturers would get an F-minus.

Don't let the minor points cloud the fact that these are powerful, character-driven stories that are worth watching again and again.

Addendum: Nov. 18, 2013:  I must concur with some of the other reviewers in noting that a full remastering, along with bonus material would have made this collection stand out among others.  As I'm going through the programs I have found a few with grainy images and one which seems to have an audio clarity issue, but nonetheless I'm still happy to own the entire series - despite the shortcomings of RLJ Entertainment and their commercialized treatment of a television classic.

More thoughts: Dec. 1, 2013:  Having now viewed most all of the box set, I have found a few more episodes with grainy video, one with a film edit, one with some damaged (torn) frames and no audio equalization throughout.  I'm still a fan of the show, and not unhappy that I own this box set by any means, but RLJ could have done so much more into making this a truly special collectable set.

I must stand corrected thanks to a posted comment by fellow reviewer Delmo Walters Jr. He correctly pointed out that CBS/Paramount released Perry Mason, not RLJ.  While they offer no extras either, their audio and video mastering of the Perry Mason series are miles ahead of RLJ's Naked City box set.  I got a bit confused because Image had issued some CBS product before (Twilight Zone, for example), and I had wrongly thought they had an exclusive content licensing deal with CBS.",1384041600,61,5129,4.836384439359268
5733090,4,B00CPR3RB0,"The series debuted in 1958 when I was 7 years old.  I was not allowed to stay up and watch it.  It came on Tuesday nights at 9:30 p.m.; however, after the Rifleman at 9:00 p.m., it was off bed for this second grader.  When it returned to television in 1960, I was 9 years old and allowed to stay up until 10:00 p.m.  Unfortunately, Naked City returned as an hour program starting at 10:00 p.m. on a school night, still after my bedtime.  So, I only caught an episode here and there when school was out.  The word on the playground and from my brother, who was 5 years older and got to watch it on occasion, was that it was realistic, gritty, and adult.

I pre-ordered the complete series here on Amazon and have now had a chance to open it, examine the packaging, check the discs, and play a couple from the first (30 min) and second (1 hr) seasons.  Here are my impressions:

DISCS AND PACKAGING:  The discs are singled sided, that's a big plus with me right off the bat.  Each season is in a plastic case, and all four cases are in a cardboard box.  For some reason, cases holding seasons one and four snap shut nicely, but seasons two and three don't snap shut worth a darn, annoying but not a big deal.  The cases and discs holders work pretty well to keep the discs protected.  I put 7 discs from seasons one and two in my Sony DVD player and all loaded properly and played when selected.  The menus on the discs are simple, but got the job done.

VIDEO AND AUDIO QUALITY:  As noted in other reviews, season one episodes (30 minutes) lack the quality of later seasons.  The video and audio quality of the episodes, both 1/2 hr and 1hr, vary quite a bit.  Some are very good (pretty close to excellent) and others are not.  They appear not to have been remastered, thus it seems to depend on how well the print of the episode was stored and has held up.  None were what I would call poor, but one or two were good minus.  But, considering that when the series was originally aired, we had a 13"" Hoffman B&W television with a roof antenna, they're probably better than what I would have seen in the early 1960s.

I pre-ordered a set on October 19th at the $99 price.  I don't know what happen, but sometime around October 27, I noticed the price on my pre-order had gone down to $25.48, WOW!  I immediately ordered another set as a Christmas gift.  So, I got two for $25.48 each.  At that price, the set, even though not remastered, is a screaming deal.  Because of the hit or miss quality of the episodes, had I paid a hundred dollars for the set I would have considered returning it for a refund.  I'm not sure I would have actually returned it, but I would have ""considered"" it.  Nonetheless, at $25.48, it's more than worth it.

QUALITY OF THE SHOW ITSELF:  From the episodes I viewed, this was a great show . . . and still appears to be so.  I will enjoy watching it over the next couple of years (one or two episodes a week) during my retirement.  And for me, they'll be FIRST RUN!  Cool.

*** ADDED January 27, 2014 ***
I've now viewed half of season one.  I'm moving my rating to four and a half stars.  This is simply great television.  The video is not that bad at all.  Besides, if it was too good, I might forget it's 55 years old. Not only is it better than most of the series offered on network televion today, you get a full 25 minutes instead of the 22 currently offered.  I'm looking forward to season two where I'll get 50 minutes instead of 44.",1383955200,93,3466,4.230534351145038
5733091,5,B00CPR3RB0,"Bought this when the presale price went to $25, so I figured, what the heck. Very happy I did.

The set in general is very straightforward with pretty standard packaging and transfers. What does stand out here in general is the quality of the transfers; while the transfers are not perfect they are nicely done and again straightforward. Looks as if this was shot full frame onto good quality 35 mm black and white and the transfer to dvd is of that sort of quality you would expect from a straight film to digital transfer. Film marks from dust and the like are noticed in most episodes but overall it is not an annoyance to me. One episode so far did appear to suffer from either exposure issues or a bad fix bath on the source material. Overall as b&w TV tranfers go this is one of the better I have seen; however its not a Criterion Collection quality transfer and edit.",1383868800,3,874,4.395061728395062

I agree with some other reviewers that the video is quite good, but not pristine (it's much better in the earlier IMAGE releases).  The 1960-63 shows are better quality than those from 1958-59.  Also, the new collection boasts ""original commercials;"" however, there are less than a dozen commercials offered, and there's no way of knowing on which show they aired.  The earlier multi-DVD sets provided the entire show including the commercial intros (""Naked City is presented by...""), the actual commercials from the broadcast date and the station IDs.  So, I plan on keeping my earlier multi-pack purchases.

All said, however, this is superior classic television at a great price: a wonderful look back at a New York City long gone.  The guest star roster is unbelievable.  Buy it while it's available!",1383868800,8,974,5.069182389937107

Unfortunately, the episodes for the most part (except some previously released by Image) have not been remastered, and it shows.  The first seasons in episodes look particularly bad.  Couldn't some effort have been made to get better copies?  Shame on you, Image - this was one series that deserved a Criterion Collection-like treatment, and you botched it.

5733094,5,B00CPR3RB0,"Everything wonderful about this series has already been said. But if you are new to it -- you are in for a seriously good ride. It explores 50s NYC like no other television show, besides ""Man With a Camera."" The city is the main character here, it lives and breathes way beyond the story lines. I'm not of this era but my folks are and when they come over they have pin pointed places that they've been and I'm all sorts of fascinated. Also, I love seeing old cars, gadgets and signs (the last disc of this series, and the only extras are a few commercials from this era).

But enough about how great this show is (I know, I know, I said nothing else needed to be said about it, and I gave an entire paragraph devoted to its awesomeness), let's talk about the quality of the discs. The show looks OK. They haven't been remastered and the first season looks subpar. It is still highly watchable, but if there is a night scene, forget about seeing anything that remotely resembles details or distance. The second through last season discs look great. Like the loser I am, I ran through all the discs to make sure. Nothing majorly obtrusive, but again, the image could be cleaned up and they would really sparkle.

The Naked City is a great TV show. It is up there in my top five, nestled between The Rockford Files and The Twilight Zone. A great series and it is a joy to finally have the complete set.",1383696000,12,1400,4.3396946564885495
5733095,5,B00CPR3RB0,"Whilst sympathising with people who (like myself) have purchased previous releases of this series, it is worth pointing out that the current offer price for the 'complete edition' is so reasonable for the amount of material on offer that criticism is really all but silenced.

It is to be hoped that the quality of the prints in the forthcoming edition will be sufficiently high to match the convenience of having everything in a once-and-for-all box.....finally.",1381017600,8,463,5.173333333333333
8584637,4,B00CPR3RB0,As the original series this set brings back a lot of memories...it starts out with James Francisco as the lead and winds up with Paul Burke later on in the series..most of the rest of the cast is the same throughout! Profound and great are the stories without being corny...in short its just the way I remember it! Some of the video quality suffers but overall it is more than completely watchable..Im very satisfied,1527638400,,416,4.635135135135135
