Taken from the Back Cover of the VHS copy.

""Bruce Lee inspired and co-wrote this martial arts epic of savage action, beauty and fantasy.

David Carradine stars as a mysterious blind man (the role originally intended for Lee before his tragic death) who leads a young fighter on a quest for Truth.

Martial arts expert Jeff Cooper is outstanding as Carradine""s young disciple who must face several dangerous combats and sensual temptations before ending his journey.

The international cast aslo includes Eli Wallach, Roddy McDowell, Christopher Lee and beautiful Erica Creer, one of the most celebrated models.

It's a triumphant adventure and a lasting tribute to the genus of Bruce Lee.""",1092528000,9,846,4.964539007092198
2054026,5,B00020WBJ6,"I love the fantasy aspect of this movie. Set in a sort of medieval or pre-biblical time period. I think the scenery, sunsets, camera work, and even the sountrack are incredible. It is more of a philisophical quest but it does have a lot of action and adventure. Even after one has seen it many times, it seems to never get old.",1090540800,,327,4.290322580645161
2054027,5,B00020WBJ6,"(AKA The Silent Flute)
A martial arts movie, for non-martial arts fans? Yes. It could be called the first Zen movie, with a philosophy that is so subtle that it is overt, so obscure that it is blatant. Written by Bruce Lee (based on several old zen stories) and James Coburn it was the project that might never have been made. But Lee's students put together the simple production in Isreal and
peopled the cast with actors like David Carradine, Christopher Lee, Roddy MacDowell & Eli Wallach. If you get off your high horse and really let this one take you, you may be surprised at how far it can take you. But, it will be hard to find.",1086825600,,637,4.361344537815126
2054028,5,B00020WBJ6,"Yes, this movie indeed is based upon a story written by Bruce Lee. Bruce Lee would originaly played the lead role and had  major roles for James Coburn and Steven Mcqueen in mind. Unfortunately the contract of making this film did not get of the ground. In that certain period of time, early seventies, it was difficult to get a major starring role in a Hollywood production when you were a Chinese.
Bruce Lee also wrote the concept for the Kung Fu series. Originaly it was titled 'The Warrior', but the producers thaught that Bruce was 'too' Chinese to play half an American! It is a shame that Bruce never got credits for the fact that he wrote the concept of the series.
For reference material read the books from the Bruce Lee Library's.",1083801600,,741,4.529850746268656

2054091,5,B00020WBJ6,"I admit it. I have loved, participated and taught numerous martial arts in my more than fifty years of training.  I also love martial arts books, weapons and films. I have both seen and bought numerous movies as well as hundreds of books on the martial arts.  This action packed movie, (Circle of Iron, which came from a story called ""The Silent Flute"" by the late Bruce Lee), is one of the very best martial arts films ever made.  Even with the horrible acting and dubious fight scenes with the co-star Jeff Cooper, this movie stands out overall as a fantastic and meaningful film.

The late David Carradine stars in this movie playing numerous parts and really carries the story.  Other good actors in this tale include Christopher Lee and Eli Wallach.  This is a story about a search for the ultimate knowledge of life which a great book is supposed to contain.  In order to reach the summit where this book is kept by a group of quiet and peaceful monks, one has to meet various difficult challenges and tests along the way.

 There is a lot of Asian philosophical lessons to be learned and the final lesson is the most revealing, which I will not give away in this review.  I have seen this movie at least ten times in the past and I still bought this recent DVD because I had lost the original VHS copy I had many years ago.  This interesting and unique movie has a little bit of everything one could desire in a martial arts action movie, including great philosophical lessons about how one might live their life more meaningfully.  ""You can't step into the same river twice"" (Heraclitis), but you can see this movie more than twice if you purchase the DVD.

2054092,4,B00020WBJ6,"The film is a bit contrived and downright corny at times, but, in spite of these minor flaws I thoroughly enjoyed it! I had seen the film in 1978 when it first screened and obtained a VHS copy a while after, which I viewed from time to time. In my opinion, it was one of Carradine's better performances (as an actor, not as a martial arts practitioner). The martial arts scenes were effective, however my main interest in viewing the film was to further delve into Zen beliefs. Granted this is not a comprehensive study in Zen, but rather a change in direction for martial arts films, helping to expose Western audiences to Eastern philosophies. One can only imagine how Bruce Lee would have portrayed the four parts played by Carradine. Additionally, this version was re-written from Lee's original script (co-written with James Coburn and Stirling Silliphant) which makes you wonder what the impact of the original would have been. His incredible physique and skills would definitely have enhanced the venture. Still, I tend to overlook the weak points and accent the finer ones. All in all, no Academy award, but a most enjoyable film in this genre.",1392163200,,1152,4.8232323232323235

2054104,5,B00020WBJ6,"Another film like this does not exist! People say the ending was anti climactic, but to me it meant that his journey was a way to find himself and the book of knowledge is a joke. ""Circle of iron"" tells us we don't need any book or person to tell us how to think, what to believe, it is discovered through our quest for the truth in our everyday lives. David Carradine plays multiple parts in the role of a life time and like ""kung Fu"", is another idea from Bruce Lee, a film that would have risen above any of the martial arts/action Lee did before. Cord, a non conformist/loner is not the chosen one even though he outsmarted and beat a contender in order to continue on to other trials pursuing the ""book of knowledge"". Buff with a ripped physique and Wearing a loin cloth like Tarzan, he pursues the trials anyway and along the way he meets a sheik, a mankey, a blind man, and death itself (all played by Carradine). Cord is oblivious to the fact that his trials are not only kung fu matches but also about love vs. self denial, how winning can also be losing, the trap of  being possessive etc. If you are a fan of Kung Fu the 70's t.v. show, then this movie is for you. Circle of Iron might be a bit too deep for others and they may not get it. There is some decent fights especially in the beginning tournament. The desert locations are beautiful as are many of the hot belly dancers and harem girls giving us all the right moves. 16x9 Bluray blows the dvd version away. 5.1 and 7.1 Surround finally gives the sound effects a much needed boost.",1361577600,,1551,4.257627118644068

2054113,4,B00020WBJ6,"I first saw this in my early twenties on TV and I was mesmerised by it's uniqueness, it seemed like part Sci-Fi Fantasy (like Conan)and part Martial Arts movie, and unlike anything I had seen before. I was a Kung Fu practitioner, so the martial aspect appealed to me, but it was the Philosophical aspect that really stood out and was the centerpiece of the film. The movie has a surreal quality to it, and the ""man in oil"" scene really stands out and literally made me wince (as a male)upon my first viewing.
I won't go into the plot, as that has been done by at least 30 other reviewers, but after I watched it I had found out it was written by Bruce Lee and I thought to myself ""no wonder that was so good"".
Now to the pros and cons : The cinematography was top notch and stands up the best big budget movies of the time (the director WAS a cinematographer, so it showed), the musical score was phenomenal with beautiful haunting melodies, I really wish they would have released a soundtrack to this film, once again stands up to the best big budget films of the time.
Now to the acting: Poor Jeff Cooper gets a lot of flack on here for his acting, but I may be the only one here that actually really liked him for the role, he has an admirable physique and looks the part, he comes across as a nice guy, and I thought his acting was decent, better in some scenes than others.
David Carradine in multiple roles and as the ""teacher"" was ,in my opinion, perfect casting, and though some may disagree I think he pulled it off better than Bruce Lee himself could have , since this was primarily an ACTING role with few fight scenes. There is no arguement that Bruce's fight scenes would have been superb, and Carradine's martial skills are abysmal, so keep in mind I am only speaking of the dialogue.
So, though most think the ""dream casting"" of Coburn and Lee would have been better, I'm not so sure, Coburn who was to play the part of Cord the seeker, though a better actor than Cooper, looks like he never worked out a day in his life, and Lee, who undoubtedly is perhaps the greatest martial artist of all time, was a lousy actor who I am not so sure could have pulled off the varied nuanced characters as well as Carradine.
Now to the cons : The fight choreography was abysmal, even by 1978 standards, and it didn't seem like there was a truly skilled martial artist in the entire cast, the director may have been a great cinematographer, but he had obviously never filmed a fight scene in his life,..and it shows. Luckily ,this is actually supposed to be more of a Philosophy movie than a martial arts movie.
Second, there is a nightime scene where Cord is supposed to fight ""Death"" in the form of a panther/humanoid, yet this scene got horribly botched, most of it cut-out, and it is the only scene that really doesn't work or fit the rest of the film, the entire scene should have been re-shot.
Third, since they decided to give this an R rating anyway(I don't know why),the sex scene could have been more graphic with a little nudity by the beautiful Erica Creer.
The make-up for the monkey people could have been better as well.
So there you have it, if this movie had ""Bruce Lee quality"" fight scenes and corrected the few problems listed above, this would have been a true 5 star movie, but as it stands it's still a great , unique, one-of-a-kind movie, a cult classic, perhaps the only movie about Zen philosophy, and for all it's cheese and low budget there is still something magical about this film that makes it one of my all-time favorites.",1303257600,4,3556,4.38939393939394
2054114,5,B00020WBJ6,"There is something about this movie that compells me to watch every time I find it.  I finally did a little research and figured out why.  Bruce Lee wrote the movie, and was to play the roles of D. Carradine.  Apparently, as was often the sad case in Lee's life, he had trouble getting people to act with him and fund his projects.  After his death Carradine bought the rights to the film and carried the project out.

Its acting is a little corny, but Bruce Lee's can clearly be seen throughout.  Worth a watch",1298851200,,511,4.326315789473684
2054115,3,B00020WBJ6,"This is such a strange and funny little movie.

For those not familiar, this story originated with Bruce Lee, James Coburn and Stirling Siliphant as a vehicle for Lee and Coburn to star in.  They had a deal to film in India for Warner Bros using blocked funds (that could only be spent in India) but the locations were no good.  The deal fell apart.  The rest is history.

As a movie, this is just...okay.  The fights are sloppy because the leads aren't very good martial artists (yes, even David Carradine) and Jeff Cooper, who seems like a nice guy, just can't act.  But everybody tries really hard.  And the ending (spoiler alert) where Cord finds the book that supposedly contains all knowledge and opens it to reveal page after page of mirrors -- all knowledge is self knowledge -- is amazing.

The Blind Man: What did you see (in the book)?
Cord: Everything!

As a movie on it's own, this two stars.  Average.

Watching it with Bruce Lee and James Coburn in mind as the leads, with Bruce Lee level fights...4 stars.

2054116,4,B00020WBJ6,"Synopsis: The 1978 film `Circle of Iron' is definitely one of those unorthodox and highly original cinematic oddities that you'll either love or hate. It's an allegorical tale of one man's quest for the meaning of life. This seeker of truth is appropriately named Cord, a boastful, arrogant martial artist who embraces no established fighting discipline or philosophical school of thought. Thus his given name is the perfect metaphor alluding to the chaotic, undisciplined soul living within this human frame. A fact pointed out by one of his adversaries in the statement, ""even you name is a noise"".

Cord seeks enlightenment and yearns to discover the ultimate meaning of life, a secret that legend says can be found in a sacred book guarded by a being known as Zetan. Cord goes on a long journey in search of this mythic being and the book but in order to find him he must face a series of dangerous trials created to impede his progress towards enlightenment. So the question is will the headstrong, impulsive Cord survive the ordeals that lay ahead? Will he be able to overcome both the outer and inner forces at work to keep him from accomplishing what he has sought out to achieve and if he does what will be revealed when he finally opens the sacred book and looks within?

Critique: `Circle of Iron' has the appearance of a very low budget, `70's made-for-television movie. The acting is bad, with the exception of Carradine, the action sequences are unimpressive, and the costumes are at times almost laughable. And don't get me started on the soundtrack. The music is so dated and corny one would think they were watching an old Keystone Cops routine. To be fair, I did appreciate the intermittent flute solos, I felt they were the only musical pieces that worked in harmony with the unfolding Zen subject matter.

Surprisingly having pointed out all the negatives mentioned above I must admit that I enjoyed the film. ""Why"" you ask? Well, I find the Zen teachings being conveyed within the medium of film simply outweigh any cinematic shortcomings. The dialogue is true to the spirit and intent of the script and the message is delivered clearly and at times cleverly. It's a one-of-a-kind film.

2054122,3,B00020WBJ6,"Whatever his personal habits, David Carradine must have been the bane of Bruce Lee's life and afterlife. After losing out on the lead role in Kung Fu despite the show being developed as a starring vehicle for him, if Lee weren't dead by the time The Silent Flute aka Circle of Iron was made, the casting of Carradine in the multiple roles intended for Lee in one of his abandoned pet projects might just have killed him. Or maybe he simply wouldn't have cared anymore. Still, it's a wonder Carradine didn't turn up playing Lee's part in Game of Death as well.

Originally written by Lee with James Coburn and Stirling Silliphant in 1970 until Lee's ego took over and he fell out with his collaborators and dropped out of a post-Fists of Fury attempt to revive the project because ""you can't afford me anymore,"" the original version was intended as a mixture of hardcore Zen philosophy and scrotum scrunching hardcore violence that bore only passing resemblance to the film that finally got made. As other reviewers have noted, the heavily revised script is an attempt to explain Zen philosophy by people who don't really understand it, simplifying it and leavening it with humour to try and make it more accessible for the American grindhouse crowd. Well, one man's philosophy is another man's comedy...

Jeff Cooper, who looks a bit like Michael Ironside on steroids with a lot more hair, is Cord the Seeker, a disgraced fighter with more brawn than brain seeking the right to search for Zetan and his Book of Enlightenment. Yes, it's one of those films. Okay, Cooper looks a bit old for this seeking lark, but he's game, but to get to Zetan he has to pass many challenges that all involve David Carradine in many guises - blind flute player, monkey king, hospitable kung fu fighting wife-swapper and death himself. Along the way he discovers humility, wisdom, that abstinence is as bad as excess, that monkeys are cowardly egotists, that you should break good looking children's noses to stop their beauty turning them into tyrants and that it's okay if your girlfriend gets crucified the morning after the night before just as long as you learn a fortune cookie parable about the nature of love in the process.

The fights aren't especially impressive, neither particularly well choreographed nor excitingly shot, while Carradine's martial arts skills are surprisingly pallid in many scenes: his fight using his flute is a rather lethargic affair with none of the rather slow blows having the kind of impact and force Lee could have brought to them. If anything, he seems to just be tapping the stuntmen rather gently. The few star names in the cast - Christopher Lee, Roddy McDowall, Eli Wallach - are little more than cameos, though Wallach is an absolute joy in the film's most notorious scene as a man who has been dissolving his penis in a vat of oil for ten years to rid himself of the temptation of the pleasures of the flesh, as you do. With a playful, matter-of-fact absurdity worthy of Lewis Carroll, it's completely bonkers and funny in all the right ways. It's also nothing to do with Lee, Coburn or Silliphant but part of Stanley Mann's rewrite that added lots of dialogue and moved the story from the modern-day East to a mythical kingdom `that never was and always is' that looks a lot like Yugoslavia with better weather and the odd desert but is in fact Israel. Still, as you may expect from a film directed by a former cinematographer (Richard Moore), it looks good and has an occasionally fine Bruce Smeaton score that sounds at times like a dress rehearsal for his haunting work on Iceman. And while it's one of those films that is easy to mock, it's also one of those films that, even while it really isn't very good, is still just offbeat enough to make it hard to dislike.

Blue Underground's 2-disc DVD is an impressive package, with a plethora of interviews - the most interesting an audio one with Stirling Silliphant - and the original Lee/Coburn/Silliphant script. The trailers are also revealing: the US distributors tried to sell it as an action film while the international trailer pitches it as `the first mystical martial arts adventure' as much to the arthouse crowd as action fans.",1245456000,2,4219,4.751705320600273

Circle of Iron (or the Silent Flute) is an acting tout de Force for actor David Carradine. This is not KUNG FU the movie. This film he plays four different roles in Cord (the seeker's) Journey. The character of the Blind man, in my opinion, reminds me of Master Po from the  Kung Fu TV show

The script originally was  written by James (Our Man Flint) Colburn, Bruce (Enter The Dragon) Lee and Stirling (In the Heat of the Night, Route 66) Silliphant. On the DVD, you can read their original  script in a DVD-ROM format. Lee was to play Cord, In my opinion, I wish he had

This mythical tale is a journey and quest for both the actors and the viewers alike. It is a challedge to watch and think about. Combining martial art ideals with Zen styling will leave the viewer either intrigued of baffled---or both!

They say a film is as good as its weakest link, Jeff Cooper is buffed for this role as Cord. However in my opinion, he has limited acting chops to handle the role is his solo scenes, including the romantic scene with Erica Creer. Thank goodness, for most of the film , he is flanked by cameos by veteran actors Christopher Lee, Roddy McDowell and Eli Wallach, who helps move to the story until Carradine character shows up again.

This film was Director Richard Moore solo film effort and it shows in someways. His audio commentary track is interesting and gives insights into the film unknown to many other than film buffs

2054128,4,B00020WBJ6,"It's been at least 20 years now since I first watched Circle of Iron as a teenager with a keen interest in the martial arts. A friend and I rented it from the local video store. We didn't really know what we were in for, only that it had been written by Bruce Lee and starred David Carradine of Kung Fu fame. I'm sure I didn't grasp nearly as much of what Lee intended to express back then. I think I get it a bit better now.

I'll be honest. By modern standards (and probably even those of that time, I would think), the fight scenes are rather poor. They are a bit overdramatized, the camera work isn't very good, and the general athleticism demonstrated is average. The sound effects are pretty typical of the era, meaning really bad by today's standard. If you can look past that, though, you may actually find yourself enjoying the film.

Overall, the cinematography reminds me a lot of the Conan films, though I don't think they same folks were involved in the shooting. I happen to like those movies, even if they were clunky in places, so take that for what it's worth.

If you like movies that make you think, then you will probably get something quite worthwhile out of Circle of Iron. Lee's intent was to explore and display elements of Zen philosophy and the film certainly does that. How much it keeps to Lee's intentions (from the original The Silent Flute script), I have no idea, but there's at least enough of it to make viewing a pleasantly thought-provoking experience. And there's a bit of comedy tossed in as well. :-)",1192147200,2,1539,4.469750889679715

2054132,3,B00020WBJ6,"""Circle of Iron"" is either a whimsical martial arts movie or a profound exploration of the nature of man, depending on how seriously the viewer takes the philosophical side of martial arts.  Based on a story by Bruce Lee, the movie features a quest by a young martial artist named Cord (played by game good humor by Jeff Cooper), who is in search of a mysterious book of knowledge.  He is sometimes accompanied on his journey by a blind seer (played by David Carradine) who alternately teaches and challenges young Cord.  The seer seems to materialize almost at random along the journey, announcing himself by playing a ""silent flute' that only Cord can hear. In a remarkably versatile performance, David Carradine also plays a series of opponents Cord must confront in his journey to the book.  The solid supporting cast includes Christopher Lee, Eli Wallach, and Roddy McDowell.

The movie alternates between the mythic landscape over which Cord travels, and the various set-piece but not always obvious obstacles he must overcome.  Cord starts out believing that fighting is the solution to every challenge, but comes to understand that more subtle arts must be learned.  At the heart of the movie is Cord's slow journey to self-knowledge, one finally fulfilled at his destination on a distant island presided over by a order of monks who guard the book of knowledge

This movie is recommended to fans of the early days of the martial arts genre, of which this movie is a better than average example.  Both the humor and the philosophy are gentle, and the fighting sequences are more rhythmic than brutal.

Now that I have watched the film and found out a little of its back story, I find the film passable at best and frankly wouldn't mind seeing it remade. David Carradine himself is great but as you watch the film you find that you wish he either took the role of Cord for himself, or he just added it to the other 4 he was already playing. Cooper is practically unwatchable. Though I did enjoy some of the notable stars in the film, I could have done without the scene involving Eli Wallach as it was a silly addition that was not needed.

The martial arts in the film are enjoyable though at times slowly paced, David does well seperating each of his characters even during the fight scenes.

I would also like to note, though Lee may have developed this story, he himself did not possess the acting chops to play the roles Carradine played, at least not as well as David did. Now the seeker, Lee could have done alot with that role. It is a shame he did not live long enough to have been involved.

This is a journey to self-discovery. The final answer, when Cord achieves his goal, is pretty good and no disappointment at all. But don't expect any great insights!

If you follow martial arts (or any other path) as a spiritual development you should like this film. If you like dramatic fights and nice scenery you may also like it. But in particular you must have a good sense of humour!

This film is a classic. A lot of people will watch it because Bruce Lee and James Coburn scripted it, and that is enough. In fact the script is great - philosophical but amusing, a nice balance of content and entertainment. At the end of the film Christopher Lee begs Cord to take on his role as 'Keeper of the Book' and enjoy the peace and tranquillity, his facing expressing horror at having to put up with any more of this peace!

The disappointment is that Bruce Lee did not live to act in this film. The acting is OK, but the martial arts action is variable in quality and never great; at best acceptable. David Carradine is just not quick or strong enough. Jeff Cooper is OK but he is not Bruce Lee.

2054137,5,B00020WBJ6,"Circle of Iron (originally titled ""The Silent Flute"") was an attempt to capitalize on the wild popularity of Bruce Lee and the Television show ""Kung Fu"" starring David Carradine. The script had been sketched together by Bruce Lee, Stirling Silliphant and James Coburn shortly after the Green Hornet was cancelled and just before Lee left Hollywood to make his fortune in China. It had been mothballed and then re-written after the death of Lee and stands as a testament to the ""Little Dragon's"" personal philosphy on life and death. Those who have read ""The Tao of Jeet Kune Do"" by Bruce Lee will recognize Bruce' fighting philosophy taken to the macrocosm of life in this film.

As other reviewers have mentioned, the martial arts fight scenes are certainly not Bruce Lee, however, the ""odd"" fighting styles of the actors sort of add to the surreal almost magical atmosphere of this film. The movies strength does not come from its martial arts, but rather its beautiful philosphy, wonderful cinematography and breathtaking locations. The movie was filmed entirely on location in India.

The story revolves around Cord the Seeker, who is really sort of an ""everyman"" that attempts to find a Book of Enlightenment by defeating one master warrior after another (ala 'Game of Death'). David Carradine plays several roles in this film, each one using different styles. Though Carradine at the time was a beginner martial artist, his physical presense and movement is interesting to say the least and makes for an entertaining fight scene. Carradine also plays a blind martial arts/Zen master that helps to guide Cord. For fans of the 70's tv series, Kung Fu it's enjoyable to see Carradine finally take his place as the heir of Master Po. One can almost imagine Kwai Chang Caine fully realized as this master.

2054140,4,B00020WBJ6,"Way back in the day legendary martial artist/cinematic icon Bruce Lee set out, along with fellow actor and student James Coburn, to create a film with the intent of displaying the spiritual side of martial arts along with imparting some of their philosophical Zen beliefs.  Brought in to assist the men was screenwriter Stirling Silliphant, also one of Lee's students, whose other works include In the Heat of the Night (1967), The Poseidon Adventure (1972), and The Towering Inferno (1974).  Anyway, the treatment, titled The Silent Flute, was finished, but apparently there was some difficulty in getting it made into a film, until about 5 years after Lee passed away, when producer Sandy Howard (A Man Called Horse, The Island of Dr. Moreau) took interest, bringing on director Richard Moore (The Wild Angels, Devil's Angels, Wild in the Streets) who claimed the original treatment `unfilmable', to which Howard hired screenwriter Stanley Mann (Damien: Omen II, Conan the Destroyer).  Mann punched it up a bit, removed some of the more graphic material (both in terms of sex and violence, which, if kept in, would have resulted in an X rating for the film), tossed in a little humor, and eventually became this film titled Circle or Iron (1978), for better or worse.  Starring in the film is David Carradine (Death Race 2000, Cannonball) and Jeff Cooper, whose previous gig had him playing Derek Thurston #1 on the TV soap `The Young and the Restless'.  Also appearing is an interesting list of cinematic dignitaries including Christopher Lee (Dr. Terror's House of Horrors), Roddy McDowall (Planet of the Apes), and Eli Wallach (The Magnificent Seven).

As the movie opens we are watching some sort of martial arts tournament, and the focus is on a character named Cord (Cooper), who looks a little like beefed up Peter Frampton, shaggy mane and all.  The purpose of this tournament is to choose a champion, one who would have to endure three trials on a path to find a wondrous book, possessed by one called Zetan, which contains all the wisdom in the world.  Anyway, Cord, who isn't affiliated with any school or restricted to any particular fighting style, easily makes it into the final match, but is ultimately disqualified due to not following the rules...if you're familiar with Bruce Lee, you might begin to see the similarities between the character of Cord and Lee as far as where they both were coming from, figuratively speaking, and their difficulties in working within the `establishment', hindered by those who need to pigeonhole people and concepts for their own sake of understanding and acceptance.  Undeterred, Cord decides to go after the book despite his not being declared champion, and has a number of adventures, encountering all kinds of interesting individuals and groups including a blind flute player who generally answers questions with more questions (he also uses his three foot flute as a weapon, causing it to make interesting sounds when he fights), a tribe of monkey men, their leader (played by Carradine) garbed in Joseph's Technicolor dream coat, a nomadic troupe/tribe, who specialize in bacchanalian delights, led by Chang-Sha, played by an an Arab-y looking Carradine, a man purposely boiling his privates in oil, a band of gypsy horseback riding desperadoes, and even death itself in the form of a puma man (also played by Carradine).  Will Cord find the strength, wisdom, and perseverance needed to confront Zetan for the ultimate prize?  What the heck is in the book that makes it so sought after?  I'm guessing secret recipes or perhaps the answer to why, when a piece of toast is dropped on the floor, it is always the buttered side that lands face down...

I'm curious as to why the title of this film was changed from The Silent Flute to Circle of Iron...I think Carradine talks about it a little in his interview piece, as those who finally made the movie decided the original title was too confusing, so they opted for a more generic, less fitting, in my opinion, title for the film.  Overall I thought this was an entertaining movie, one that stayed relatively true to Lee's original intent of focusing on the transcendental and philosophical aspects inherent within martial artistry, although I couldn't help get the sense it may have gotten watered down a little in the process, perhaps in a effort to make it more accessible to mass audiences.  It's interesting that Carradine, who plays four, separate roles, was chosen to appear, since he also took on the lead in the 1972 television series Kung Fu, a vehicle created by Lee with the intent that Lee also star, but prevailing prejudices at the time chose to go with the Caucasian Carradine, making him appear Asian, rather than going with a real Asian in Lee himself.  I thought Carradine, who was originally sought to play the part of Cord, but felt he had since 'graduated' from the role as the student, did very well, creating four, distinct characters, and nicely offset the awkwardness in Jeff Cooper's performance.  Cooper has the physique, but lacked the required acting range, in my opinion, to properly portray his character , especially in terms of being an arrogant, nave individual whose quest for a material object turns into a often dangerous journey of learning and self discovery.  There are a number of interesting locations used, and the anamorphous fighting sequences were kept realistically within reason.  I thought director Moore did very well keeping what was probably a difficult story to film on track and paced well.  I did like the somewhat humorous revelation in terms of the book and the character of Zetan, played by Christopher Lee, even though the revelation itself was obvious, especially to anyone who's seen a number of chop socky films.

The picture quality on this Blue Underground DVD release looks sharp, clean, and generally excellent, and is presented in wide screen (1.76:1), enhanced for 16 X 9 televisions.  The Dolby Digital 2.0 mono comes through well enough, and I had no complaints.  There are a number of worthy extras including a newly recorded interview with David Carradine titled Playing the Silent Flute (13:55), an audio commentary track with director Richard Moore, a sort of dissertation titled Bruce Lee's The Silent Flute: A History by Davis Miller and Klae Moore, an alternative title sequence, a theatrical trailer, three 30 second TV spots, a poster & still gallery, and a DVD-ROM feature containing the first draft script by Bruce Lee, James Coburn, and Stirling Silliphant.

By the way, did anyone understand the significance of the sequence with Eli Wallach as the man in the oil?  Was it just a humorous interlude, or sort of representational allegory representative of some abstract concept?",1121731200,38,6782,4.995563442768412
2054141,4,B00020WBJ6,"It's about time this classic came out on DVD. I have two VHS copies in case one wore out.  The screenplay was written by Bruce Lee and two of his Hollywood students, James Coburn and Stirling Silliphant.  The plan was to have Coburn play Cord and Lee play the multiple roles of Death, the Blind Man, the Monkey Man and the Rythm Man. That would have been a better film, but things like Lee's death got in the way.  The action scenes are good, not great.  It's the philosophy (which Lee majored in College) that make this film worth seeing.",1113264000,5,539,4.36
2054142,5,B00020WBJ6,"I'm not going to go into a whole lot of detail about the storyline details of the Silent Flute...but keeping it short & sweet, Bruce Lee's Zen philosophy is alive and well in this film. I can only descibe it as Beastmaster meets Conan meets Zen Buddhism from start to finish...and the overall message is clear, the philosophy that Bruce Lee pushed from the founding of Jeet Kune Do, which was that TRUE and EFFECTIVE martial arts is without fixture and that the TRUE source of life and empowerment is found within. In comparison to the hatchet job that 20th Century FOX did on Bruce Lee's Game of Death...I'd recommend Circle of Iron/Silent Flute a million times over because it captured the spirit and philosophy of Bruce Lee. Only wish he'd have lived to star in and see the movie, but David Carradine does a nice job. The only thing is,wouldn't Bruce Lee have been a little salty about HIS intended roles being taken up by the guy who STOLE his role in the Kung-Fu TV series? As sure as we'll never see Bruce Lee catch up with David Carradine to take out his frustrations PHYSICALLY ,only God knows and we'll never know. LOL! But Bruce's philosophy is as alive & well as his fighting spirit in this film so I strongly recommend it for Bruce Lee fans and those that adhere to his philosophy.",1111363200,5,1293,4.506382978723404
2054143,5,B00020WBJ6,"Wow, This movie is cool! It is sort of wierd but I even ejoyed that.  It is probably one of the coolest Martial Arts movies that is not based on action, but more philosophy.  If Bruce was around of course the action would have been even better, but the story is still amazing. David Carradine did a very good job acting as the Flute Player, the Monkey Man, the King,the Panther Man....",1108252800,3,385,4.333333333333333
2054144,4,B00020WBJ6,"Just a few years ago when dvd just started getting big in the market, I, like many other people was excited.  I was worried however that many obscure, older films would never get the dvd treatment.  Coz at that time, only the big blockbuster snoozefests like Armageddon were coming out on dvd.  Over the years I've been proven wrong however, and it's the fault of companies like Blue Underground.  It's nice to know there are people in high places who like these kinds of films too.  And because of them I get to see long lost favorites of mine like Shock Waves and Conquest get first class dvd treatments-even if the films aren't first class.  Circle Of Iron is one of the newest of this bunch.  I was surprised to see this come out.  Even the vhs had been long out of print, but hey, if if Breakin' 2-Electric Bugaloo can be released, anything's possible.  If Bruce Lee could see how his idea turned out, I'm not sure how impressed he would be(having yet another of his roles taken by David Carradine!), but I like this movie.  ""Cord"" sets out on some quest to find this famous bigshot(Christopher Lee) who guards a sacred book that everyone wants to look at.  The book is supposed to bring higher enlightenment or something, it's never clearly defined.  Lee's character is assumed by Cord to be some kind of ultimate martial arts expert that Cord will have to fight in order to check out this book.  As he sets out on this quest(he doesn't even earn the privilege to go on the quest, he kinda cheats his way into it) he must go through a set of ""trials""-all of which include David Carradine in one way or another.  Carradine's in Dr. Stangelove mode here, playing four different roles-a flute playing blind man(who Tarantino obviously modeled ""Bill"" after), a bizarre monkey/human fighter, a warrior playboy type and Death himself(a character that should have had more than one scene.  He's actually kinda creepy).  There's an awful lot of Zen philosophy that obviously reflects Bruce Lee's personal philosophies.  These are considered merely ""riddles"" by our open-minded hero, Cord.  I don't believe I've seen this Jeff Cooper guy in any other film.  He spends the entire film with Robert Plant hair, topless, and just thoroughly arrogant.  A great time capsule of a movie, it's just too bad Lee had to die before he could make his dream project the way he wanted.  The extras consist of all the regular stuff like galleries and trailers, plus a 13+ minute interview with Carradine and an essay on Bruce Lee and his ideas for the film.  Apparently Carradine enjoyed making this film more than any other.  It shows.  Thanks again to Blue Underground for realizing there are people out there who aren't interested in buying Armageddon on dvd.",1102118400,13,2744,4.70440251572327
2054145,3,B00020WBJ6,"This cult film starring David Carradine and Jeff Cooper is a fantasy/martial arts adventure trying to mix Eastern philosophy, particularly Zen Buddhism, into a film that enlightens and entertains.  This is a strength in the film and a weakness.  First, David Carradine does a fine job playing four different parts originally written for Bruce Lee (Lee co-wrote the story).  As the flute player Carradine is great, delivering his lines well and being a believable character.  The other parts he is not so believable, but all in all, enjoyable enough for the movie.

Jeff Cooper (Cord), however, is not a very good ""seeker.""  Besides a couple one liners here and there, he just is not believable as the seeker.  This in part due to average acting ability and his martial arts skills, or the lack there off, are extremely noticeable.  This is not to say Carradine is a great martial artists, he is not, but he is able to pull it off - Cooper is not.  Lastly, Cooper got the role when it was first casted for karate legend Joe Lewis(as least rumored so).  Lewis would have been a much better fit and it would have naturally brought up the martial arts fight scenes to an acceptable and more enjoyable level.

The film quality is good, the sound track a little too much 70s TV sounding, but the sights are great, while the martial arts sequences are lacking technique and excitement.  The movie, however, is a good guilty pleasure.  It has enough fortune cookie philosophy to instruct, but not to be taken too seriously (after all, the movie's thesis, discovered at the end of the movie, logically fails).  The movie has much of Bruce Lee's fighting philosophy (good) and Zen philosophy (muddled at best) and the movie is escapists enough to bring about a learning, yet, entertaining evening.

The three stars largely ride on the extras.  The interviewed David Carradine is nice as well as the history in the development of the movie.  Lastly, though the movie is advertised as ""Circle of Iron"" because that was its release title in the US, it was nice to see the producers of the film, open the movie with its original title, ""The Silent Flute"": the title Bruce Lee intended.  The story was written by Bruce Lee, James Coburn, and Stirling Silliphant.",1098144000,23,2247,4.747422680412371

2054147,4,B00020WBJ6,"Back in the eighties, when I first saw the movie, I was stunned that a fairly unknown actor was playing the main character of Cord while David Carradine was seen more of a supporting role, but then I began to understand the underlining msg that Carradine's characters brought forth.  The most memoriable sub-story was when Cord and the Blind Man entered a village that honored a young and handsome boy as a prince based only on his physical beauty and the outcome after Carradine's intervention.  This scence was a very astute perciption of how our society, as a whole, deal with the young and beautiful.  While the Pink Floydd movie The Wall is considered to be a must see for true rockers, the Circle of Iron should be a must see for serious martial artists that are on the journey towards enlightenment versus martial artists that only journey for competition thropies.",1096156800,7,872,4.76158940397351

up watching cable because it's a new toy and I'm half drunk. 'Circle of Iron' is on.

I'll admit I probably couldn't appreciate the iconagraphy back then, but I did understand the visuals were meant to signify other things. Eli Wallach enjoying a bath of boiling oil sticks out in particular. Every battle the main character fights is meant to open his awareness.

Battle as education. Probably better than any other technique we're using now, from the looks of things.",1095638400,5,532,4.760869565217392

I'M ALSO GLAD THAT CARRIDINE IS DOING AN INTERVIEW AND THAT THERE WILL BE A TRIBUTE TO BRUCE LEE. IT IS REALLY NICE WHEN THEY PUT THOSE EXTRA GOODIES ON DVDs.

BRUCE LEE WAS AND WILL FOREVER BE AMAZING. HIS GUNG FU HAD ITS BIRTH IN THE WING CHUN STYLE OF GUNG FU UNDER THE TEACHING OF YIP MAN THE LATE GREAT GRAND MASTER OF THE WING CHUN SYSTEM.

I RECENTLY PURCHASED ANOTHER DVD ON AMAZON DOT COM CALLED WING CHUN THE SCIENCE OF FIGHTING BY LEGENDARY MASTER WONG SHUN LEUNG. MASTER WONG WAS A SENIOR STUDENT IN YIP MANS WING CHUN SCHOOL AT THE SAME TIME WHEN A YOUNG BRUCE LEE CAME ALONG. BEING SENIOR STUDENT MASTER WONG WOULD OFTEN BE CALLED UPON TO LEAD THE CLASS BY GRAND MASTER YIP MAN, THEREFORE, YOU CAN SAY THAT BRUCE LEE LEARNED QUITE A BIT FROM THIS GREAT WING CHUN MASTER.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND BOTH OF THESE DVDs TO ANYONE INTERESTED IN BRUCE LEE AND THE ORIGIN OF HIS JEET KUNE DO WHICH HAD ITS BIRTH IN THE WING CHUN SYSTEM.",1094515200,4,1162,4.105726872246696
