817145,5,6304267053,"The Little Mammoth Big Action video series is simply outstanding.  We have The Big Aircraft Carrier, Submarine, Space Shuttle, Plane Trip, Train Trip, Air Show and Christmas Tree.  Each one keeps my 4 1/2 year old enthralled - and I know I've picked up some new information by watching these with him.  If you have the kind of child who loves learnig about how things work - who runs for the non-fiction section of children's books over the fairy tales - then these are the videos for your kids.",1044662400,5,495,4.53932584269663
817146,5,6304267053,"This video is great for both kids and adults!  Narrarated by a child, this video takes you on a journey where you feel like you're living on an aircraft carrier.  See what it's like to have one of the many jobs on the deck of an aircraft carrier, or even cook meals for such a large ""floating city"".  Excellent all the way from the fighter plane coverage to the post office within the carrier that is so large it carries its own zip code!  This is my sons #1 video choice!  Enjoy!",1014076800,9,480,4.173913043478261

7865849,5,6304267053,Loved this when i was younger. My father is actually in this video. He was an F-14 pilot on the USS Nimitz in the early 90s. I've wanted to be a pilot all my life.,1338336000,,163,3.6857142857142855
7865850,5,6304267053,"We bought this as one of our son's third birthday presents as he is currently into all things aircraft - and he LOVES it. It is produced in a very easily-digestible kid format with title screens in multi colors and things explained very well in easy terms for children, with the narrator being a child herself. Although aimed at kids, it's also interesting for adults alike and gives a great insight into the goings-on on a modern day aircraft carrier. We were lucky enough to be able to time giving this to our son to watch in the car on the trip down to San Diego, with a surprise visit to the USS Midway aircraft carrier museum based there - safe to say he was in heaven! Thoroughly recommended.",1244592000,,698,4.4186046511627906
7865851,5,6304267053,"When I watched this documentary about aircraft carriers, I expected it to be dry and boring.  I was wrong, big time!!!  My boys, ages 6 and 4 love it and ask to see it often.  I learned quite a bit from it too.  I highly recommend this movie for both boys and girls.",1170460800,,266,3.9622641509433962
7865852,5,6304267053,"This is an engaging and educational video about life on an aircraft carrier.  It covers everything from the aircraft it carries to the kitchen, medical, and mail facitilites.  My 5 year old son prefers educational videos over any other kind and this is one of his all time favorites (as well as The Big Submarine). The Little Mammoth series delivers quality content that keeps both children and adults entertained and wanting more.",1135900800,,431,4.972222222222222
7865853,5,6304267053,"This is the first Little Mammoth video we purchased and we were immediately hooked on the series. The entire production is very professional and engaging. The music is appropriate and not terribly annoying, but the highlights are the great footage, excellently written and delivered narration, and attention to detail. The narrator is a girl, and her comments are occasionally punctuated with questions from a boy. Graphics are used to unobtrusively introduce concepts such as size, height, and volume. And best of all, there is a female pilot along with the many men interviewed and lots of shots of planes taking off and landing on the aircraft carrier. My 3 year old LOVES this video and asks to see it frequently. I don't mind a bit!",1085097600,,737,4.904
