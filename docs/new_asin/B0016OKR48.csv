8263617,5,B0016OKR48,"If you can see through the mess of politics that come about when a white man, especially a cop is dead and someone believes it was a black man---strange how the reverse doesn't' really get so much of a reaction out of the powers that be.
Great story, I hope this man gets his well-deserved re-trial.",1402876800,,299,4.357142857142857
8263618,5,B0016OKR48,"This documentary is somewhat dated but still powerful and moving.  For anyone unfamiliar with Mumia Abu-Jamal's case - or anyone who knows only the prosecution's story parroted by the corporate media - this DVD clearly shows how the corrupt and brutal Philadelphia police, with the collusion of a corrupt, racist prosecutor and a bigoted, biased judge, used inconclusive, contradictory - and at least partially fabricated - evidence and testimony to railroad a brilliant African-American journalist to a murder conviction and death sentence for reporting on police brutality and surviving a police officer's attempt on his life.  An unbiased and rational assessment of the facts, and the totality of the evidence that has been uncovered in this case, can only lead to a conclusion of DOUBT.  Most people who claim certainty of Mumia Abu-Jamal's innocence were not present at the shooting incident which led to his arrest and conviction - but neither was ANYONE who claims certainty of his guilt.  Mumia Abu-Jamal should have been acquitted because he was NEVER fairly or conclusively proven guilty.  The best part of the DVD for me was the interview with Mumia himself, who has always maintained his innocence.  Thankfully, Mumia is no longer under the threat of execution, but he remains wrongfully imprisoned for life without parole.  Anyone who believes in First Amendment rights, judicial fairness, racial justice or any of the principles this ""land of liberty"" claims to stand for, should demand that the state FREE MUMIA ABU-JAMAL NOW!",1340668800,2,1541,5.239837398373984
8263619,5,B0016OKR48,"Mumia Abu-Jamal is an innocent man that has been violated in every way possible by the Philadelphia Police, DA, and F.O.P. This film exposes some of the ways the system gets-its-man. Mumia Abu-Jamal's case is a complete failure, and travesty of justice. This film is compelling, and it will greatly inform viewers of the facts that aren't reported on by the commercial news media. MUMIA ABU-JAMAL MUST BE FREED!!!",1312588800,2,413,5.0
8263620,5,B0016OKR48,"Very informative video.  Gave insight on a case that I knew relatively nothing about.  Also raised the question of whether jurors in US Courts really know how high a standard 'Guilt Beyond a Reasonable Doubt' really is.  As a lawyer, I know that the standard means that there is absolutely no rational explanation for the occurrence of a crime, except that the defendant did it.  Under the facts as presented in the video, had jurors applied the standard fairly, there is no way this man would have been convicted.",1241136000,,514,4.741573033707865
