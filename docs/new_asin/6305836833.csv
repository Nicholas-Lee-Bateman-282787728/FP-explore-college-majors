1081755,4,6305836833,"There is something strangely appealing about this low-budget, nearly forgotten British horror film from 1957. It made the US rounds on the B side of horror double features in the late 50s and then pretty much dropped  out of sight. Most movie review tomes dismiss it as a waste of time, but  the horror genre (apart from a few ""monstres sacres"") is  generally dismissed as a whole by these surveys. If approached within the  confines of the late 1950s monster/horror movie genre,  ""Womaneater"" holds it own quite well.
In terms of acting, there  is really nothing to criticize. George Coulouris seems, for better or  worse, born to play a faustian madman. He can achieve a wide-eyed look that  is frankly rather disturbing. Joyce Gregg, as the housekeeper and  frustrated former lover, is also successful at suggesting turmoil under the  surface.
The film has the perfect horror-film look of its period: stock  jungle footage plus shadowy studio interiors. Edwin Astley's soundtrack is  heard to advantage on the DVD, and it's appropriately creepy. There is an  overall luridness about this film that is just plain compelling. We first  experience it in the so-called ""dance of death"", during which the  native girl victim (Marpessa Dawn) does no dancing whatsoever, but rather  swoons to an intoxicating drum beat. Later, a potential victim has her  blouse ripped just enough so that we may glimpse her bra-strap. And when  the mad doctor needs more plant food, he visits what looks like a seamy  district of Soho (a highly effective location sequence, by the way). Such  little concessions to a prurient audience add to the charm of the film. In  addition, there is a walking dead scene that harkens back to the 1930s  Universal horrors.
On to the monster. Here is where the film makes a  tiny claim to immortality. This is no vampiric stalker, resurrected  dinosaur, or bloodthirsty alien. It is, quite simply, a tree. But what a  sinister, malevolent-looking tree it is! This fairly nightmarish invention  is covered with shaggy tendrils and has two kinds of apparently powerful  tentacles with which to grasp its prey. Of course, the prey must be placed  into, or forced to enter the clutches of the tree, but that contributes to  the originality of the conception.
This little gem has been out of  circulation for many years. Previous video incarnations have been extremely  shoddy, using broken elements with nearly inaudible sound. The DVD issue  presents ""Womaneater"" in what must be the best condition  possible, which is pretty good. See it, if you dare.",959126400,43,2565,4.988179669030733
1081806,3,6305836833,"I can't disagree with the one and two star reviews, as this kind of movie will only appeal to a very specific audience.

 I watched it because as a elementary school kid in the 50's, I remembered it coming to my local theater.

The special effects are wonderfully low tech...a man in furry tree suit beckoning hither to the comely maidens and the scientist/adventurer obsessed with reversing death into life.

If you watch it, please be advised, it won't take much of your time. Horror was much shorter then than now. Precursor to Little Shop of Horrors with a jungle twist. Enjoy",1399420800,,554,4.680412371134021

Watching it now?  Well, let's say it's easier to see the flaws at 60 that it was a 6. Kind of a grade B (or C?) film about a mad scientist who brings back a man (or in this case, woman) eating plant.  The movie has it all.  The jungle, beautiful women, a native with special hypnotic powers to entrance women for sacrifice to the plant with his jungle drums, and a basement laboratory.

Probably not the movie you'll watch over and over, but fun for an evening in front of the screen, and maybe some popcorn to finish off the mood.

He uses its sap in his regeneration serum. Of course, the good doctor needs a steady supply of victims for his leafy partner. The police are stumped by the sudden rash of female disappearances. Enter Sally Norton (Vera Day), a carnival sideshow dancer. Sally finds herself stranded after being fired. Well, it just so happens that Moran needs a live-in housekeeper. How can she possibly keep herself from becoming fertilizer? WOMANEATER is a British monster movie from 1959. As such, it keeps the woman-eating to a minimum. If you enjoy voodoo, mad science, and / or killer plants, then WOMANEATER should be on your watch-list...  FUN FACT: While there is no WOMANEATER plant, there is a SHEEP-EATING plant! Google it!

1081926,3,6305836833,"...not THE WOMAN EATER as Columbia's poster art (see DVD cover) proclaimed. That's a very important distinction as the film is about much more than just a woman eating tree. The movie is actually a misogynistic fable about the male attitude toward women in general and George Coulouris' attitude in particular. The story involves a mad doctor's attempt to use an Amazonian flesh eating jungle tree to produce a serum that will bring the dead back to life. Since this is 1957 and sex can't yet be depicted, we do get to see George and his native assistant have virtual orgasms watching the women victims get devoured (not shown) which is very adult for the time. An added subplot shows the doctor's devoted housekeeper's reaction (she's his former lover) to attractive Vera Day's arrival to serve in the household. This leads to a remarkable scene where the doctor states quite bluntly that older less attractive women should make way for younger more attractive ones. This is clearly a Grade B monster/mad doctor movie with something more on its mind than the standard fare.

Ultimately though WOMANEATER (which could just as easily be titled WOMANHATER) is a grade B movie in the best low budget British tradition. It manages to squeeze more out of itself thanks to good photography, excellent use of sets and locations, and an eerie music score. Then there are the performers. George Coulouris as the doctor, Jimmy Vaughan as the native assistant and Joyce Gregg as the housekeeper/lover all give vivid performances enhanced by the above average script. Marpessa Dawn (BLACK ORPHEUS), Sara Leighton and especially Joy Webster as the victims provide 1950s style eye candy with their tight dresses and pointed bras. Vera Day is no slouch herself and a couple of shots of her sitting in a car while her mechanic boyfriend gapes at her attributes are simply amazing in their brazenness. Like most of the British films from this era, WOMANEATER's approach mixes the cerebral and the carnal with more emphasis on the former than the latter which will put off most of today's viewers but for those of you willing to go the distance, this is more than just another B movie.",1259020800,3,2167,4.872628726287263

Women are given to the plant (it apparently does not like men) and fluid is drawn that become the elixir of life.  The explorer, actually a doctor, falls for a new employee at his estate and appears to go slightly mad as his experiments near completion.
But add the girl's boyfriend (possible fianc), madness, love, hate, a fanatic priest and a killer plant and you wind up with a film that climaxes and stops suddenly.  It could have been better by simply explaining how things went from jungle to estate.  One scene would have done it.  It would have been in character for the doctor to gloat some more and give the explanation of his genius.

1081995,4,6305836833,"I'm a little embarrassed to admit it, but I love this movie. Lurid title and all. It's a b&w low budget British pot boiler about a crazed scientist who brings a big cheesy looking ""tree"" back from the Brazilian Amazon that eats women---but only pretty ones. Mumbo jumbo about tribal rituals have intoxicated the doctor (George Coulouris) into believing the serum derived from the tree can restore the dead to life. But AFTER it's eaten a pretty woman. So, he lures young women home---drugging one (Joy Webster from ""Burn Witch Burn"") with a ""funny cigarette""---to his laboratory/dungeon. There, his whacked out ""Brazilian native"" assistant Tanga (Jimmy Vaughan) dresses them in a sexy outfit complete with bracelets and puts them in a trance by wildly beating bongos. Tanga gets VERY turned on (and sweaty) and pushes the girls into the writhing lobster claw arms of the tree. Will the doc's blonde and pretty new ""housekeeper"" (Vera Day) be the tree's next meal? And will the nosy OLD ""housekeeper"" wind up a zombie? Turn your brain off and watch this 70 min. wonder and just enjoy. Nice DVD print from Image makes this rainy day flick a keeper for lovers of old b&w cheesy horror movies like myself. Oh, and that's beautiful Marpessa Dawn (from the Oscar winning ""Black Orpheus""---also 1959) at the beginning as the jungle sacrifice to the tree. Interesting career leap.

1081996,3,6305836833,"This is obviously a small budget British horror film.  There's only mild tension when the young beauties are being fed to the flesh eating plant, and it doesn't rate the 5 Stars of say ""X-The Unknown"" or ""The Quatermass Experiment"".  But you could do worse, for instance, say with the majority of American made films made with the same low budget.  The British cast in this is talented, and the story is character driven instead of monster driven, so somehow works in a way that's like reading a short story from a black and white pulp science-fiction magazine in the fifties.
The ""slightly"" mad scientist is played by George Couloris, a veteran stage and film actor.  You can also see him in a bit part that's a ""bit"" more colorful in Hammer's ""Blood from the Mummy's Tomb"".  He does a good job here of giving at least a little meat to a stock mad doctor role.  The real eye candy is not the man eating plant, but the gorgeous actress Vera Day, who plays Sally, a young girl who looses her job swinging her hips in a traveling fair dance show and hooks a job from the good doctor via a local car mechanic who meets her and falls in love in apparently ten seconds or less.  But who can blame him.  Vera Day was undoubtably a gorgeous blonde bombshell.
The monster plant is cheesy enough to give the film that comforting Saturday Matinee feel.  And Image Studios has released this DVD in widescreen, though it doesn't appear to be anamorphic.  The packaging says the sound is Dolby Stereo, but I had to turn the sound up, as it seemed a little low and fuzzy at time.  I have to say all-in-all, if you like black and white monster movies that take place mostly in old English manors, complete with dank cellar laboratory and volumptuous girl victims, you can't pass on this one, not for this low price.",1050624000,18,1800,4.4573170731707314
