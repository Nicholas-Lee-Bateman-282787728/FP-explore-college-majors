5400671,5,B00A8PPL9M,"Set in Communist East Germany in the early 1980s, cold war paranoia is in full view in Christian Petzold's Barbara, winner of the Silver Berlin Bear for Best Director at the Berlinale. In Barbara, Petzold has fashioned not only a superb character study but a film that illuminates the effects of oppression on the human psyche, an oppression that ended in Germany only with the dismantling of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of East and West many years later. The film shows the East German security apparatus' (Stasi) use of intimidation and disorientation as tools in operating a system of control and surveillance directed at those suspected of opposing the GDR.

Portrayed by Nina Hoss in a performance of remarkable nuance and authenticity, Barbara, an East Berlin doctor, has been exiled to a small clinic in the provinces after applying for an exit visa to visit her boyfriend in the West. She is a tall, stately, and attractive woman, yet taciturn and distant, her face filled with an indescribable sadness. Trying to serve her patients as best she can, she knows that she is under surveillance by the Stasi, particularly by Officer Klaus Schutz (Rainer Bock), who does not hesitate to conduct unannounced searches of Barbara's apartment, even her person, and whose presence in her life is all too visible.

Not knowing whom to trust, thinking (perhaps rightly so) that her friends and colleagues may be police informants, Barbara's aloofness leads her colleagues to give her the nickname of ""Berlin"" to describe what they think is her big-city attitude. On the job, however, she does not allow her fears to get in the way of her professional responsibilities and her relationship with her patients shows her hidden warmth. Dr. Andr Reiser (Ronald Zehrfeld), a soft-looking, slightly heavy-set doctor, solicits her friendship and offers repeatedly to drive her home but she keeps him at arms length, suspicious of his possible connections.

In spite of this tense atmosphere, Barbara manages to befriend Stella (Jasna Fritzi Bauer), a young patient who escaped from a work camp at Torgau. Correctly diagnosing her with Meningitis, a diagnosis that the other doctors had overlooked, she reads The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn to her in the evening, a story of two people on the run. More tension is added when we see Barbara's surreptitious exchange of black market cigarettes and packets of money with people unknown. In a rapturous meeting with her West German lover Jorg (Mark Waschke) in a secluded forest area, she is given the choice of leaving the country with him, reassured that, because of his circumstances, she would no longer have to work.

Barbara and her friend make plans, but her growing relationship with Andr and ties to young Stella become complicating factors. Andr's own story of how he ended up in the village only adds to her confusion and uncertainty. Barbara is an understated gem that never hits us over the head with its message but leaves no doubt about its implications. While the film depicts the circumstances in a particular country, it transcends its limitations to become a universal experience. A compelling and riveting film, it begins in resignation and ends in transformation.",1370044800,,3230,5.054409005628518
5400672,5,B00A8PPL9M,"Not as powerful as ""Lives of Others"" - but there is in this film an amazing portrayal of heroism on a one to one, human to human level, and of doing what you can do and holding what is truly of value close when times are toughest.",1366070400,17,230,3.9148936170212765
5400673,4,B00A8PPL9M,"This is a fine - if very understated - piece of film-making.

Barbara Wolf (Nina Hoss) is a city doctor exiled to a provincial hospital in the German Democratic Republic in 1980; closely watched by the secret police and distrustful of her colleagues, she leads an isolated, paranoid existence while planning her escape to Denmark with the help of her wealthy West-German lover.
The film is slow-moving, but infused with a subtle tension; Hoss gives a mesmeric performance as a dedicated professional who is also a vulnerable, sensitive being, persecuted by an intolerable system. Her supervisor, Andre (Ronald Zehrfeld) whom she gradually comes to trust, is more accepting of his situation and is sympathetic towards her, despite his role in monitoring her for the authorities.
The film is dour but compelling; a restrained but thoughtful and intelligent drama, well made, photographed and acted.
The cover blurb suggests it will be of interest to those who liked ""The Lives of Others""; yes, but it is a very different film from that, much more personal and complex in my view.
There are no extras on the disc; the film is presented in widescreen, in German language with subtitles in English.

A good solid, restrained and thought-provoking film.",1362355200,20,1247,5.078048780487805

5400675,4,B00A8PPL9M,"Set in a small seaside town in northern former East Germany, 1980, about nine years before the Berlin Wall is torn down, Barbara follows the story of the titular heroine (Nina Hoss), a doctor who, being banished from the capital, has just arrived to work at the local hospital.

Barbara looks cold and aloof, but when a young girl Stella (Jasna Fritzi Bauer), who has unsuccessfully run away from a labor camp, is brought to the hospital, her supervising doctor Andr (Ronald Zehrfeld) quickly realizes that Barbara is really a very good doctor, who is knowledgeable and responsible.

What Andr doesnt know is that while placed under Stasi surveillance, Barbara, fiercely secretive, has been working on a plan carefully laid out, with a help from her boyfriend currently living in West Germany.

Directed by Christian Petzold, a German drama Barbara greatly benefits from strong performances from the cast and the bleak landscapes. Here the suspense is not about what happens to her; it is about the decision she makes in a society pervaded by suspicion and mistrust. To call it a thriller may be misleading as the film is more about the central character and the changes she undergoes against the background of the Cold War.

Germany's official submission to the Best Foreign Language Film category the Oscars 2013, Barbara is an engrossing portrayal of credible characters and their relationship. The film may be too slow-paced and its storyline a little predictable (with a Mark Twain reference), but the result is still rewarding.",1361318400,3,1533,5.047430830039525
5400676,3,B00A8PPL9M,"Barbara is a German period drama, set in 1980 when there was still an East Germany under a repressive Communist government.  It won a number of awards in Germany including the Silver Bear award for Best Director (Christian Petzold) and was Germany's official submission to the Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film though it failed to make the final shortlist.

The film centers around a German doctor named Barbara (Nina Hoss), beginning with her arrival at a small country hospital in an obscure rural town on the Baltic Sea coast.  We learn that she has been transferred there from her former position at the prestigious Charit hospital in East Berlin as punishment for having dared to file an ""Ausreiseantrag"" (an official request to leave the German Democratic Republic) so that she could join her lover Jrg (Mark Waschke), a doctor living in West Germany.  At her new post, Barbara works as a pediatric surgeon under the department's chief physician, Andr (Ronald Zehrfeld).  Although Andr makes an attempt to be sociable, Barbara maintains a cool distance (from him and everyone else) telling him directly that she knows the local Stasi (the East German secret police), headed by a man named Schtz (Rainer Bock) has ordered him to spy on her.  The shamed expression on his face at her accusation confirms that it is so.  This is life in East Germany of the period:  the Stasi are watching you and they want you to know that they're watching you.

While keeping an emotional distance from everyone around her, Barbara does however openly care about her patients.  She is also an excellent doctor, a point which is made when a young girl named Stella (Jasna Fritzi Bauer), a runaway from the local youth detention center for juvenile offenders, is brought in for treatment.  Andr initially thinks she is faking being ill, but Barbara quickly contradicts him, diagnosing the girl as suffering from meningitis.  A caring and compassionate doctor himself, Andr is not only impressed by her skill but also by the way Barbara attends to the girl during treatment.  During treatment though he determines that Stella is pregnant, which makes returning her to the detention center all that much harder for Barbara.

In spite of the scrutiny with which she is being watched, Barbara has not given up on leaving East Germany.  She is working on a plan for escape with the assistance of Jrg, whom she slips away to meet in secret at an Interhotel  (special East German hotels for visiting foreigners).  The ultimate plan involves getting money to Barbara which she will use to pay her passage to be picked up at a secluded beach location one night and smuggled out to a boat which will take her across the Baltic to Denmark where Jrg will be waiting for her.  But as the appointed night approaches, complications ensue, and Barbara finds herself being pulled between her desire to escape and her role as a doctor when Andr says he needs her to assist in an operation on a patient that night.  And her feelings for Andr himself, whose compassionate nature and commitment as a doctor has softened her initial attitude towards him.  But when Stella suddenly appears at her door, injured from another escape attempt and in need of her help, Barbara faces an even more difficult set of choices.

The movie is best at depicting how restrictive, repressive and just plain depressing life was under the old East German regime, and at showing the stresses that come from being constantly under surveillance by a government that made a point of showing that they had myriad ways of making your life difficult, as Barbara's experiences exemplify:  loss of job, being sent to a place where you know no one, living in drab conditions with no comforts or amenities and worst of all, no real hope for the future.  And of course the prospect of having the Stasi suddenly show up to search your living quarters, not because they expect to find anything but simply to remind you that they can whenever they feel like it.  And for any transgression - like not being where they can find you, as Barbara commits when she slips away to meet Jrg at the Interhotel for a few hours - they up the repressive measures, subjecting her to humiliating cavity searches the next time they show up to search her apartment.  The film emphasizes the grimness of life in that time by the muted colors and overall greyness of the setting, and by lacking a musical score for most of the film, which makes the scenes pass in the midst of a subduing stillness, heightening the effect of watching Barbara's growing tension and anxiety as the repressiveness of her life threatens to overwhelm her.

Most of the performances are quite good, with a couple of exceptions.  Nina Hoss does an excellent job of bringing out Barbara's intense self-enclosure, the way she shuts herself off from the people around her as a survival measure, only occasionally letting her guard down with people like the girl Stella, her lover Jrg, and ultimately with Andr.  Rosa Enskat does very well in a smaller but important role as Hausmeisterin (house-mistress) Bungert, the eyes and ears of the Stasi in the building where Barbara lives, always reporting on Barbara's comings and goings and always reminding her that she's being watched.  Unlike Rainer Bock's Stasi officer Schtz, the film makes no attempt to soften or sympathize with Enskat's Bungert, which makes her all the more effective.  Less effective is Ronald Zerhfeld's Andr, who starts out well but increasingly comes across as being too noble and high-minded to be believed as the film goes on.  This is not however so much a fault of the actor as it is a fault of the screenplay.  I also found that Barbara's suddenly having feelings for him as the critical night approaches - to the point that it complicates her plans to escape - also a bit hard to believe, but the fault for that too lies within the script and not the actors.

All that said, however, the film suffers from two big weaknesses.  The first is one of pacing.  Things move very slowly for most of the film, which, combined with the lack of a musical score, can sometimes make things drag to the point that some people may actually fall asleep.  The other, and far bigger problem, is the way in which the film ends.  I won't spoil the film for any potential viewers by revealing it, but I will say that I found it unrealistic to the point of being unbelievable, completely undermining everything that led up to it.  My wife, who actually comes from a Communist country (Vietnam), found it particularly so.  She thought the film did an excellent job of portraying what life was actually like in those days under a Communist government, where you had to be extremely careful what you said or did because the government always had people reporting on you.  But she found the ending not remotely believable, saying that no one - and especially not a professional person like a doctor - would do the things that Barbara ultimately does.

Recommended for anyone interested in what life in East Germany was like for most people back then, with the caution that they may find the ending more than a little hard to believe.",1358467200,7,7184,4.7612903225806456
5400677,4,B00A8PPL9M,"""Barbara"" (2012 release from Germany; 105 min.) brings the story of a female doctor, Barbara (played by Nina Hoss), in a provincial town in East Germany in 1980. It appears Barbara had applied for an exit visa so as to leave the country, and as a result was demoted from a prestigious hospital in Berlin to now work in the country side. Barbara has a lover, some well to-do guy in West Germany who sends her money so as to prepare things for her to escape East Germany illegally. All the while, Barbara gets to know Andre (played by Ronald Zehrfeld), a colleague doctor who also has been sidetracked (but for different reasons we later learn) in the country side. Right away from the very start Andre has a crush on Barbara, and he is trying to charm her non-stop. As all of this is happening, Barbara takes a special interest in Stella, a teenage girl who has escaped from a nearby youth labor camp and suffers from various ailments. To tell you more about the plot would ruin your viewing experience. You'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out. I will say that I did not see the end coming at all, so you are in for a surprise!

Several comments: the movie does a great job depicting life in East Germany in the early 80s. Pay close attention to the scenery in the small town where Barbara is working, and notice how stark everything is. Cars are far and few between, and the living conditions are pretty dull, if not grim. In between we also notice the never-ending political pressure that existed in East Germany, where everyone and anyone could be spying on you on behalf of the Stasi (the East German state security agency). More importantly, the movie brings a nuanced and rich character study of the various roles, none more so than the lead character, as we see her struggle between charging forward and preparing for her planned escape to the West, while caring for the people around her. Nina Hoss brings nothing short of a brilliant performance.

I read that Germany is submitting this movie as its official entry for Best Foreign Movie for the next Oscars (early, 2013) and that seems fully deserved. As it happened, I saw this movie during a recent home visit to Belgium. I was supposed to see another movie but due to technical difficulties that movie wasn't showing and the box office attendant suggested that I see this movie instead. I took him up on that suggestion, and am I glad I did! ""Barbara"" is an outstanding political and relationship drame, and is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1353283200,30,2510,4.575555555555556
5400688,4,B00A8PPL9M,"A beautifully spare movie that distills the anguish of an entire time & place into the lived experience of one character. The movie wastes no time explaining anything, so I was occasionally a bit confused about what lay behind some scenes. And I couldn't help but wonder if the subtitles didn't quite work in a few instances; there were lines that just didn't add up to the characters' gestures & facial expressions or even the way the German ""sounded"" to we non-German speakers who were watching. But the central dilemma--a woman who desperately wants to leave East Germany but is equally compelled by her commitment to her patients--is clear from the start and drives the film forward. The lack of adornment in the film--no background music, no fancy cuts or edits, just people in front of a camera--reminded us of Dogme 95 films & was perfect for this compact, intense exploration of quiet desperation and the will to remain humane under even the most difficult circumstances.",1463184000,3,979,4.903614457831325

5400695,5,B00A8PPL9M,"""Barbara"" is a German film by director Christian Petzold about a woman doctor living in East Berlin, under control of the Soviet allied government before the fall of the Berlin Wall. In a terrific performance by actress Nina Hoss, Barbara is very talented doctor, but is being punished for trying to go to the west. The job shes placed in is quite undesirable, and she live under continual harassment from the Stasi secret police, one officer of which is particularly harsh on her, so its understandable quite mistrustful of strangers. But even so she dedicates herself to her patients, as much as she can within the societies confines. She wants very much to keep trying to go a freer Europe.

The relationships Barbara has with her new supervisor Andre, who might have more than one motive to be near to her, is truly fascinating and complex, and I would say the best part of film. She wants to distance herself from him and her other colleagues at first, for reasons which are later justified, but also finds she cannot isolate herself either. She has emotional connections with a few patients, she treats, one of which is a particularly disturbing case of a girl who ran away from a work camp whos initially difficult to the other doctors but Barbara finds a way to connect. At home shes usually alone, unless theres a terrifying surprise visit from the Stasi. But she has engagements elsewhere other than home or hospital that show the full range of a woman she is.

If this isn't on the level of the a few other modern masterpieces about east European life behind the Iron Curtain in the last decade of the Soviet UnionIm thinking of ""The Lives of Others"", and ""4 Month 3 Week & 2 Days""its a extremely admirable and smart one that comes close, which shows human desires in the face of repression and the fear one lives under in such society. Its part thriller with romantic elements, but more so its a human look the interaction between several different individuals in this society where ones fated role dictated by the society can be very hard to escape.",1443225600,,2062,4.662087912087912

5400709,5,B00A8PPL9M,"The setting is East Germany, 1980.  Barbara Wolff is a doctor who has been assigned from a big hospital in Berlin to a smaller, provincial hospital.  The movie opens with her arrival in the provincial town, and two things are immediately apparent: her depression and the fact the fact that she is under observation by the political authorities.  There is a relationship between these facts, for it's revealed quite early in the movie that Barbara had applied for permission to travel to West Germany, and the authorities suspect -- correctly -- that if she were to leave East Germany, she wouldn't return.  Her posting to the provincial town is not so much punishment as it is a means of control: she can be observed more easily there.  It soon becomes clear that Barbara has not given up hopes of defecting -- she has a West German lover who manages to see her a couple of times (obviously, it's easier for a West German to visit the East than vice versa), and they have a plan . . .  A good deal of suspense is generated by Barbara's carefulness in keeping her plans (and they involve money, documents, etc.) secure from the observers.

Meanwhile, Barbara has to do her job in the hospital.  The head doctor, Reiser, is impressed by her -- she makes a diagnosis he had missed, and had missed for non-medical reasons (the patient, Stella, is a young woman who keeps trying to escape from a youth labor camp) -- and we learn the interesting circumstances of Reiser's own position in the provincial hospital.  As time passes, and Barbara is refining her plan of escape, Reiser makes no secret of his romantic interest in her, and it becomes clear too that he wins her respect.  It's all leading up to a moment of decision which resolves itself in a surprising (but not implausible) way, and I won't say more in the interest of avoiding spoilers.  The movie reminds me of the more melodramatic ""The Border,"" in which Jack Nicholson plays a character in an intolerable situation who tries to make the ""right"" choices and whose air of defeated stoicism is similar to Barbara's.  It's a movie that reminds us that we aren't just free-floating individuals with ""rights"" that require to be cashed in.  We're in personal and professional and political contexts in which claims are made on us and which complicate moral choice.  Barbara is reminded at one point that ""the people"" have paid for her education -- the implication is that she owes them, in the form of the state, whatever services they require.

Nina Hoss is splendid as Barbara, Ronald Zehrfeld is very sympathetic as Reiser, and Rainer Bock is the Stasi officer tasked with keeping an eye on Barbara.  The movie subtly suggests the backward state of the East German provinces, their natural beauty notwithstanding, in the visual representation of both the interiors and exteriors of the houses.  Not so subtly, we're made aware of the almost degrading invasiveness of the regime, as it deals with people it doesn't trust.  And trust of another kind, of course, is required for the work that Barbara does and which she takes seriously.  The final short scene, with its attention to the faces of Barbara and Reiser, is marvelously poignant -- as indeed is the whole movie, for all its ""political thriller"" trappings.",1438560000,2,3270,4.755752212389381

Other reviewers have said plenty about the plot. I would like to comment on the way ""Barbara"" is filmed. It moves slowly, deliberately, with many long closeups of the principal actors' faces, with no background music, no clever transitions between scenes, and very simple scenery.

The rage and bitterness is barely concealed on her facial expression, while she is over and over humiliated by the communist regime.
She has however not lost her sense of ethics or morality as a doctor, and does her duties as such. She meets a young woman from a what appears to be some kind of concentration camp, and feels for her and helps her ultimately to escape at the cost of her own possibility to escape.

5400727,5,B00A8PPL9M,"I really liked this film a lot. It is a good story done the way the Germans do it. Moderately paced and with good character development for the time allotted. Somewhat suspenseful and gripping at times it stays close to the characters and isn't padded with cuts and confusing time sequences. It is a straight forward  warm tale about two doctors, focusing on one as a very dedicated physician and the other caught between her chosen profession and an irresistible desire to escape from the oppressive and invasive forces that were created by her past. They both give heartfelt convincing performances. Nina Hoss hides her emotions behind her large dark penetrating eyes but is deeply empathetic. It is a real treat to watch how silently and reservedly she confronts desperate people and moves toward her real destiny.  A very warm film. Paul K.",1395446400,,844,4.895104895104895

That movie was far more compelling yet it would be unfair to simply review ""Barbara"" based on a comparison. It is a completely different approach with the main character being the ""watched"" rather than ""watcher."" ""Barbara"" is suspenseful. The character is unremittingly closed-lipped and the starkness of rural East Germany is clearly presented . . . better yet ""felt."" Watch this movie, not just because it is well-acted, it is also a good reminder to all of us to be vigilant.",1392508800,2,619,4.794392523364486

But while 'Others' goes for the brass ring of being The Big Picture that depicts the sordid truth that propped up the DDR, Barbara tells the story on a smaller, more subtle scale.

This is Barbara: one woman's story.  It's her quiet desperation and struggle to get out of what is now clearly a failing state.  She's put the wheels in motion and now has to oh-so-cautiously carefully execute her plan.  There are eyes everywhere.  Standing in the way: her own conscience.  Not about turning on the state mind you.  Zero remorse there. Rather, it's about her commitment to two new people in her life: her new patient, clearly distressed and suicidal; and, her new boss, Andr, someone whose tender heart is revealed throughout the movie.  How this all plays out makes for some stirring story-telling.

5400747,5,B00A8PPL9M,"For Barbara, that's the West.  She longs to escape oppressive East Germany, where she is a known malcontent and the object of Stasi surveillance and oppression.  A doctor from East Berlin, her punishment inlcudes banishment to the sticks, far away from even East German sophistication.  She has a lover from the West who makes secret visits and helps plan her escape.  Meanwhile, she becomes involved in the treatment, and lives, of her adolescent patients and slowly becomes drawn to her boss, a fellow doctor tasked with making reports on Barbara to the Stasi.  His motives are ambiguous to start with -- he seems sensitive and intelligent, but we, as Barbara, don't know initially to what extent it's an act, or to what extent he supports the regime that Barbara so despises.  I can't give away the end, but suffice it to say that it carries a major turn, and that turn makes perfect sense of all that has come before.

The story unfolds at a gradual pace.  Some may think it's too slow.  To me, it felt natural, and it carried plenty of suspense.  Its naturalism is unforced, unaffected, unlike films that convey realism with a nausea-inducing hand-held camera or tediously long shots of nothing much.  Here, you disappear into the world of the movie without noticing how the trick is done.

Nina Hoss's performance, like those of others in the film, is beautifully subtle -- so subtle that you become attuned to even the slightest adjustments in her outward attitude.  The last shot -- of silent facial expressions -- effortlessly, perfectly conveys volumes, so masterful has been the acting and story-telling.

You have to admire the stark realism here. Whether you want to go there or not, this film truly takes you to a secluded province of East Germany, 1980. BARBARA affords an acute look at the inside of a totalitarian state. While it doesn't show a whole lot in this regard, what it does is shown most effectively. The lack of any soundtrack--something I didn't even notice while viewing but that one of the other reviews here points out--only adds to BARBARA's immediacy.

However, there is a palpable feeling in the air that something is amiss in East Germany for she is being watched. She is a very cautious and cool character wary of all that goes on around her.
The film has no music and is shot in mostly tones of grey. The mystery unwinds and you will be deeply involved in the story and what Easr Germany was like in the 1980's.",1387238400,7,653,4.133858267716535

5400763,5,B00A8PPL9M,"This is a beautiful, human story of a woman  doctor in East Germany in 1980.  She has applied for permission to leave  the country to join her lover in the West.  This has caused her to be discharged from her position in a prestigious hospital in Berlin and to be sent  to a small one in a provincial.town where she is given a shabby apartment and subject to constant surveillance. . We see her choices, as she is torn between her desire to leave the oppressive atmosphere  and her love of helping the ill.  Her supervisor is a kindly, shaggy bear of a man who is as warm as she is cold.  He has his own problem with her.  He has been assigned by the authorities to report on her and at the same time he grows to admire her professional expertise.  He is sympathetic to her situation, even as he is put-off by his attempts to be kind..  What eventually bridges the gap between them in their shared compassion for the sick in their care.  It's safe to guess that he is not immune to her beauty, either.

The tale is beautifully told, it unfolds very naturally and we are carried along by her dilemma.  We see the contrast between the anti-life forces of the repressive regime and the pro-life efforts of the doctors..  The actors are all wonderful.

East Germany was a paradox of attempting to be a humane, socialists country that was a captive to the Cold War pressures coming from the USSR. For most people, life was a mixture of more than decent living conditions and a police force that overreached, not unlike South Korea today.  The acting is pitch perfect of people finding their way in a confusing world.  The subtlety of daily acts of being proper, tolerant, ambitious, protective, strong and cooperative is shown with honesty and special insight.  The lessons of these people's challenges apply to our own today where surveliance is everywhere.",1385424000,8,731,5.177966101694915
5400765,2,B00A8PPL9M,"(Corrected to make clear Barbara is a doctor, not a nurse) Like ""The Lives of Others"", this movie tries to show us the nasty side of East German life. Unlike ""The Lives of Others"", it does so most tediously. Barbara is a doctor who hates the Communist regime: she is transferred from Berlin to a clinic in a remote town on the Baltic coast after she requests permission to leave the country. She has a West German lover who is keen to arrange her escape and have her come live with him. Barbara is regularly harassed by the local police and is sure the other male doctor in the clinic is spying on her. So we plod on and we see Barbara being bothered by the police and taking care of various teenagers from the miserable local work camp. She slowly develops feelings for the male doctor and her quandary (escape or not escape) only increases when - clumsy writing alert - she is with her lover and he tells her that when she gets to the West she won't have to work because he earns so much money. The pacing throughout is dreadfully slow and there is no suspense, even right up to the end. I kept trying to turn it off and my wife resisted, at one point saying ""I'm waiting for a surprise ending"". My response was ""Oh, you think it will get interesting?"" The end does come and thank goodness, although of course it's a cliche. This is a missed opportunity.",1385337600,2,1356,4.32156862745098

5400767,5,B00A8PPL9M,"Christian Peltzoid's Barbara is a film stripped of the old post-Wall clichs about DDR,(think Downfall,Lives of Others,Baader-Meinhoff) a world of Nazis,terrorists and Stasi,no high drama,more long contemplative shots,precise framing and deliberate pace,a kind of neo-realist reconstruction. We are in a state of being off balance,unexpected camera angles,languid long shots and sudden close-ups. Nina Hoss is his regular lead actress(cf. Yella,a woman in Germany's depressed East who seeks Western success but maybe only dreaming her escape from the lake into which her stalker ex-husband has plunged her).In Barbara she's a doctor seeking to flee provincial East Germany where she's been sent for wanting to be posted to the West in 1980. She will be working in a hospital where mistrust of her colleagues and what she says is uppermost. We have to read in between the lines and guess what is buried in the looks and gazes. Peltzoid fleshes out the idea of DDR with colour,the wind, green woodland,cawing gulls,the sea, the night lights. Having Barbara making trips on her cycle opens this up,with over-the-shoulder-glances. We are in a world of mood-music,despite the fact Barbara is called on by the Stasi a couple of times,her pokey rooms searched and her body(by a female),for incriminating evidence about her desire to escape. Cold and aloof from hercolleagues, a caring co-worker Andre(Zehrfeld) who maybe monitoring her,attempts to make her feel wellcome. A coded communication develops,beneath what is being said another language is evolving,duty to her patients versus desire for freedom and escape with her lover from the West Jorg,who brings her black market supplies of stockings and cigarettes. The film's direction is one-way,when will the moment of escape come and do we want her to?If this film were music it would be minimalist,glacial,restrained. Her plans of escape are compromised by thawing attitudes,we snatch glimpses of compassion and warmth behind her icy mien,genuine concern for her patients,Stella(Bauer),who she reads from Mark Twain to,an escapee from a local socialist work camp,and makes a crucial discovery about another patient,Mario,who she and Andre will have to perform emergency surgery on when from a kiss,the doctors are getting closer. There is a surprise ending which I won't reveal,a change from thriller to melodrama. Peltzoid's detachment is aesthetic,cue Andre's analyses of a Turgenev story and Rembrandt painting,in a film that is beautifully elegant and subtle. Hoss is superb.",1380326400,4,2527,5.515463917525773
