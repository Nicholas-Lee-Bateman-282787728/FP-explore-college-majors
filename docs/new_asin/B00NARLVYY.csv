8676990,3,B00NARLVYY,"Solomon Crow (Sean Weathers) is a crack addict. He hustles for money, then gets a girl to shoot up with him and have sex. He also moves in with his brother (Waliek Crandall) who ignores his wife (Sybelle Silverphoenix). That is pretty much it as he lies, steals, and cons.

The hustle jobs are classic con jobs that don't work on most people. Solomon does them poorly. The best hustlers wear a suit. If you like watching sex and a lot of nudity, this film has enough of it as it borders on hardcore pornography with its unsimulated sex scenes. Plot wise the film is not developed and the humor of people falling for Solomon's lies doesn't work too well.

8676993,4,B00NARLVYY,"A new outing for Mr Sean Weathers; this time more on the comedy side then ""They all Must Die"" or the great nod to 70s Black exploitation film ""Hookers in revolt"" . Scumbag Hustler tells the tail of just that, a Hustler, who will stop at nothing to get his next fix. He weaves stories to unsuspecting people from default cash card wins to ""ill share"".
The film is shot in Mr Weathers usual guerrilla style, which i love from public streets to even a back room of a Target store, Weathers and company will much like your hustler in this film steal your location with i am sure a certain amount of double talk and distraction.
Thoe my dream is to see Mr Weathers go more into a full on Splatter horror film, it seems a sequel to Scumbag Hustler is already in the talks which is ok with me, this is a funny film of double talk which has nods to 70s exploitation as well as even zany comedies of the 30s and 40s.",1418860800,3,907,4.159090909090909
