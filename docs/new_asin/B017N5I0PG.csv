8739816,3,B017N5I0PG,"The film is inspired by real events, i.e. there are Indo-Canadian people living in Vancouver and people are being killed. Beeba Boys means ""Good Boys"" similar in meaning to good fellows. Jeet Jahir (Randeep Hooda) is a gang leader who has made waves by insulting the older Grewal (Gulshan Grover). A man named Nep (Ali Momen) close friend to Grewal's daughter (Gia Sandhu) is a double agent between the gangs and walks a fine line.

The gangsters are very family oriented. They seem more intellectual then the common gangster and wear pink and powder puff blue suits with orange turbines, and at other times they look western. The film shows the local prejudice against Indian gangsters. Much of the film was comical and I don't know if it was intentional as I felt I had to laugh at certain cultural aspects such as the mothers of the criminal gangs all work out at the Jewish Center and sauna together.

It does have a musical number at a wake, but not exactly a Bollywood production. It was a professional production, just don't know how to digest it.
