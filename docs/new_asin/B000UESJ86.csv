2921708,5,B000UESJ86,"After purchasing the book 'Therapeutic Chair Massage', I decided to order the DVD set 'Seated Therapeutic Massage' as well, because there is nothing better than techniques actually seeing being performed after reading the book. For all massage therapists who cannot physically attend a Ralph R. Stephens seminar or workshop, this set of 3 DVDs is definitely one of the best investments they can make. Very comprehensive material, professional teacher! It's a pity we don't have such great video material in german. And here is a further insider's tip for dedicated massage therapists: 'Deep Tissue Massage and Myofascial Release: A Video Guide to Techniques' by Art Riggs.

Nachdem ich das, leider nur auf Englisch verfgbare Buch 'Therapeutic Chair Massage' gekauft und gelesen hatte, bestellte ich nachtrglich die DVD Serie 'Seated Therapeutic Massage' direkt in U.S.A. Es gibt bekanntlich nichts besseres als 'live' dabei zu sein, auch wenn das Buch bereits eine Flle an Informationen bietet. Meine Empfehlung an alle Massage Therapeuten, die nicht persnlich an Seminare oder Workshops eines Experten wie Ralph R. Stephens teilnehmen knnen: bestellen Sie unbedingt diese Videos. Es ist mit Sicherheit eine der besten Investitionen in Ihrer Weiterbildung, die Sie je gettigt haben! Einziger Wermutstropfen: englisch sollte man schon beherrschen und beim Empfang der Ware, schlgt der Zoll erbarmungslos zu (Zoll und Einfuhrsteuer)! Hier ist noch ein weiterer Geheimtipp: 'Deep Tissue Massage and Myofascial Release: A Video Guide to Techniques' by Art Riggs.",1207267200,13,1558,5.601694915254237

8213175,3,B000UESJ86,It had great information more then I learned in school. One thing I must say is I wish the video did have different angles at times I really couldn't see the movements of his hands.,1455148800,,181,4.2
8213176,4,B000UESJ86,I already own several of Ralph's other dvds and am currently watching to enhance my skills to better serve my clients. While as always he's very good at explaining techniques in this dvd it is sometimes hard to see what he's doing. I really wish he would have utilized multiple angles so that it'd be easier to determine hand placement. There are some times that he gets in the way a bit or the camera is too far away and a close up would be ideal. I would definitely suggest getting his book on Therapeutic Chair Massage to use in conjunction with the dvds which is what I did so that it will make learning/refreshing techniques much easier. I would still suggest buying this if you are new to the Massage Therapy profession or if you simply want to try and get a better grasp of therapeutic techniques for chair massage instead of strictly relaxation.,1428969600,,853,4.509677419354839

8213179,3,B000UESJ86,Very basic and moves way to slow. I trouble staying with it but I will finish it eventually.  I did pick up a couple of tips so it's worth it.,1401062400,,142,3.7333333333333334
8213180,4,B000UESJ86,Very in depth review of chair massage and includes the associated muscles affected within each area. A very nice breakdown of chair massage. Excellent review. The only drawback is their attempts at selling their brand of products and the plugging of their items becomes tediuos.,1365465600,,278,5.2
8213181,5,B000UESJ86,This is a really great disc set.  Ralph Stephens gives a very relaxed and nicely illustrated tutorial for chair massage.  He has a good sense of humor and his proficiency and dedication to his craft shine thru.,1358121600,2,210,4.648648648648648
