1386584,2,B000050ZF6,"The parody, 'Curse of Fatal Death', is only about 15 minutes long! The rest of the video is dedicated to how the parody was made which, in my opinion, was boring and tedious. There are three other parodys of Dr. Who at the end of the tape (about 5 mintues each) which are Ok.  Although Rowan Atkinson and Hugh Grant are seen in the spoof, I was very disappointed that there wasn't much substance in the parody. The skit is well made, using some orginal Dr. Who visual and audio effects and music, but not enough substance. I probably would not have purchased 'Curse of Fatal Death' if I knew how short it would be.",978134400,18,614,4.339130434782609
1386585,3,B000050ZF6,"OK.  I will admit it.  I am a die-hard Whovian.  I've been to conventions.  I got chills the first time I saw Peter Davidson in person.  I had my photo taken with some man dressed up like the Master.  I am a geek, and I am proud.
That said, I hope all you other geeks will join me in buying this truly hilarious spoof on what was **and should be again** a wonderful slice of British Television, Doctor Who.  There are some very brilliant tongue-in-cheek gags (I'll explain later), some surprises, and lots of laughs.  If there really is a force of good in the universe, the BBC will see how popular this video is and show the good sense to put the ""real"" Doctor Who series back into production.
The ""behind-the-scenes"" footage is even funnier than the spoof itself.  I was touched by the true affection almost all the stars have for the old series.  Jonathan Price displays a rapier wit, and the whole process looks like so much fun, I wish I could hop the next Concord over to help them with the next installment!
The 3 additional sketches are also cute, especially the Larry Henry sketch which uses the same gentle homage and parody which make the Comic Relief sketch great.  Buy this. It'll make a wonderful addition to your collection and it will put a smile on your face.",977616000,13,1276,4.4334763948497855
1386586,5,B000050ZF6,"Doctor Who has got to be the single most profitable series for the BBC that they're not making.  Like the original Star Trek in the 1970s, the rights-holders can simply sit on it, push out a few videos and books now and then and watch the money pour in.  In the 11 years since Doctor Who went off the air in Great Britain, there have been three new showings.  This is, by far, the best.
Originally produced as essentially a for-charity effort by the producers of Doctor Who and a few famous stars, ""The Curse of Fatal Death"" shines even though it was filmed over a period of three days with essentially no budget and borrowed sets.  It succeeds as both classic Doctor Who and as wonderful parody.
Somehow, Rowan Atkinson brings not only his own brand of humor to the role, but manages to capture both the dignity of the Doctor and the Doctor's quirkiness.  It's a shame we will almost certainly never see a series with Atkinson and Julia Sawalha.  I'd be the first in line for tapes if they ever did.  Atkinson and Sawalha are not the only beacons in this series, though - everyone puts on a wonderful performance, from Jonathan Pryce to Hugh Grant and Joanna Lumley.
The extras on the tape are also quite fun.  The behind-the-scenes look at the production is hilarious at times.  Jonathan Pryce turns out to be a lot more manic than I would have predicted.  The extra Doctor Who parodies also make it well worth the purchase.  None of the three shown have ever really had the opportunity to make it to America before.  If the humor value of the three occaisonally wanes, it is more than made up for by watching the British make fun of Doctor Who as we ourselves have in America from time to time.
""The Curse of Fatal Death"" is just plain wonderful.  Buy it and watch it if you have any interest in Doctor Who or British comedy whatsoever.",977011200,,1839,4.4375
1386587,4,B000050ZF6,"Well this might just be your video! Rowan Atkinson plays the Doc kinda like a gentler Black Adder. Very funny and the series of big name cameo regenerations at the end makes the tape that much funnier. Behind the scenes show follows the main feature. As an added bonus there are 3 comedy sketches from various British shows. The French and Saunders skit was kind of goofy (thus the 4 stars instead of 5....not quite perfect), but seeing Lenny Henry do a sort of Doctor mixed with Shaft routine is hilarious. In summary....DEFINITELY lives up to WHO name.",976492800,9,554,4.663265306122449
1386588,4,B000050ZF6,"After months of waiting to finally obtain this video, due to Warner Distribution problem, and the SNAFU on ""The Edge of Destruction""'s release, ""The Curse of Fatal Death"" is a side splitting parody of Britian's long-running Sci-Fi program. Advid and casual Who viewers will ""certainly"" find something enjoyable about it. Rowan Atkinson makes a great Doctor, and all the other British actors and actresses just look like they're having so much fun. The documentary and the three Who skits at the end are a nice bonus for any Who nut, but ""Curse"" steals the show, and just makes you think that new adventures of the Time Lord(televised, that is)should be on the top of the BBC's to-do list to bring the Doctor back on the air.",976492800,4,724,4.753968253968254
1386589,3,B000050ZF6,"Many of us Doctor Who fans love the show as a guilty pleasure. The series is so quaint... has wonderful moments of originality and some great homage. This video is a tribute to the 26 seasons (and more than 30 years) of one of the most popular and durable science fiction/fantasy series of all time.

British Comic Relief has done some great skits in the past (like the Blackadder special ""Cavalier Years""). But to pay tribute through a comedy special??? Wouldn't some of us fans feel slighted? Well this comedy special isn't anywhere near as biting as the Saturday Night Live ""Star Trek Convention"" sketch with William Shatner (which was very funny). It's actually written and performed in a very fond way.

First of all, what an obvious choice of actors to play the Doctor. Blackadder/Mr. Bean actor Rowan Atkinson plays the role well enough to think he should take the role on seriously. Pair him up with another brilliant actor, Jonathan Pryce, as his arch-enemy the Master. He throws himself into the sinister role, practically twisting his mustache. It all resembles melodrama... but don't forget that some of the most loved episodes of Doctor Who share that quality.

The Doctor's companion should be familliar to fans of Absolutely Fabulous. Julia Sawalha wouldn't be my first choice for an actress to play the Doctor's loyal companion, but she does great. Julia brings everything that comes to mind when you hear the words ""Doctor Who girl""... and that's not an insult (well, she may not look like Nicola Bryant, but you can't have everything).

The little special throws in another favorite villian, episodic cliffhangers, plus a nice regeneration scene... with each following Doctor bringing a nice touch (to be fair, they all play themselves... or their TV/film personalities to be more precise). I won't say who they are (except, They seek him here/They seek him there...)

Don't buy it and expect and Doctor Who/Blackadder hybrid... buy it to enjoy four short episodes as an honorable tribute to our favorite Time Lord. It's a better special than ""Dimensions in Time"", which tried to do the same thing (but ""Dimensions"" bit off more than it could chew, ""Curse"" keeps it short and sweet).

Perhaps the show will return someday, but I'm not holding my breath, so Curse of the Fatal Death will be forced to be the last bookend for the series... it could be much worse.  Curse of the Fatal Death is a nice reminder of the fun that Doctor Who can have.",972345600,,2461,4.831353919239905
1386590,4,B000050ZF6,"Dr Who-Curse of the Fatal Death proves the Doctor Who is alive and well in the 21st century.  Although a parody, Curse of the Fatal Death stays true to Doctor Who characters and events.  Starring Rowan Atkinson, Johnathan Pryce and Hugh Grant, this video is one of the funniest takes on the DR. WHO mythos I've ever seen.  Done for Comic Relief, Fatal Death will be a welcome addition to any DR. WHO library or make a great gift for any Whovian.",972172800,7,445,4.402439024390244
1386621,5,B000050ZF6,"""Curse of the Fatal Death"" is much more than a parody of Dr. Who--in many ways it is a loving tribute. Rowin Attkinson gives such a good perforance as the doctor, that WHEN Dr. Who comes back, and should Paul McGann decide not to play the doctor anymore; I hope Rowin Attkinson will be given consideration to play the real thing. The regeneration scenes are well done, particualrly the last one (I loved the sonic screwdriver joke). The making of segment is interesting; and the other 3 sketches are ok, with the Lenny henry one being the best. If you have a sense of humor aabout being a Dr. Who fan, or have a friend who always makes fun of you--this video will make an excellent purchase.",1001376000,2,691,4.448818897637795

It is a little known fact to outsiders that Doctor Who 'enthusiasts' (They never call themselves fans!) actually like laughing at the quirks and deficiencies of their favourite programme. When a spoof is written clumsily and without knowledge or affection it will ring hollow with the fans (whoops! I mean enthusiasts!). But this is informed and written with intelligence by Coupling creator Stephen Moffat. There's a Hollywood A List of guest stars, the best probably being Jonathan Pryce who looks great as the Master! The roll call of Doctors reads like a fan's (Damn!)wishlist, the only things that let it down are some peurile toilet humour and the brevity of the piece. But hey, it's for Cheridee!",1001376000,,765,4.847328244274809
1386623,4,B000050ZF6,"'The Curse of Fatal Death' was a Comic Relief special production from 1999. It was made with obvious love and admiration for the original series, and is quite funny. The story is divided into two short episodes, using the familiar Dr. Who theme from the Tom Baker (4th Doctor) era, and I must say that the episode 1 cliffhanger is one worthy of the regular series, itself.
  Comic talent Rowan Atkinson plays the 9th Doctor (presumably he has regenerated from the Paul McGann 8th Doctor profile). He and his companion land the TARDIS on a planet, hot on the heels of The Master (perfectly played by Jonathan Pryce). A clever banter convenes between the two Time Lords, and the story is soon in full motion. There is also an appearance of another familiar Who adversary.
  'The Curse of Fatal Death' contains many pertinent ""in-jokes"" to the classic series, pokes fun at it without being rude to its memory, and actually contains a rather involving (if superfluous) storyline. Hugh Grant, Jim Broadbent, and Joanna Lumley also guest-star (as do other notables).
  The VHS tape also includes a ""behind the scenes"" documentary, which is in many ways funnier than the actual production. I have quite a childhood fondness for 'Dr. Who', and it is nice to see so many well-known people taking the time to do such a well-done parody of the show. Also featured on the tape are three skits from various British series, all spoofing the show. The best, in my opinion, is the one from the Lenny Henry Show. If, for nothing else, it mocks the the often used device of the Doctor and his companions running up and down multiple plastic corridors in attempts to evade the villians.
  If you are a die-hard 'Doctor Who' fan, then 'The Curse of Fatal Death' will bring a sincere, nostalgic smile to your face, and may make you bring out some of those old episodes to watch again. There's nothing better than watching the Doctor save every planet in the Universe 27 times (a joke from the show). Once more, Who is back in action.",997315200,6,2012,4.663841807909605
1386624,5,B000050ZF6,"I've been dying to see this since I first read about it a few years back. The bonus material on it is... well... a real bonus.

1386625,5,B000050ZF6,"""What is it Doctor?"" ""I'll explain later""
""If you're going to spy on me you should at least turn off the speaker""
My only disappointment is, with the length of it it's too short. This in-joke riddled tongue in cheek parody of the BBC's longest running Sci-Fi Series Doctor Who might not be a laugh a minute but it has its humorous moments. What Doctor Who parody is complete without the obligatory running down countless identical corridors? ""I'll tell you later"". Rowan Atkinson as the Doctor, one incarnation of several actually and the one with the most screen time, is a riot as usual. Any Black Adder or Mr. Bean fans will appreciate this comedy skit even if they have no idea who or what Doctor Who is. Doctor Who fans who have to have every Doctor Who video will of course want this one. Amazingly even stuffy take their Doctor Who Too Seriously Whovians are liking, and buying this video. Hopefully that means a DVD release sooner than expected. Hope! Hope! Pray! Pray!
I don't want to spoil too much of the plot for folks who want to see this so I won't mention the thing that I would not have wanted revealed to me before watching it. One of the things I will mention is also a partial warning, there are lots of jokes and references to that gaseous bodily function that is referred to in the sketch as ""Bottom Burps"". In fact the planet that the TARDIS materializes on is The planet the TARDIS materializes on was home to a race that was so flatulent that they have the largest and most sophisticated sewer system in the universe, which is pardon the pun the butt of some jokes.
For extras there is a ""Making of The Curse of Fatal Death"" which immediately follows the feature, which is interesting but is not essential for a VHS. Following the Making of featurette there are three other Doctor Who Parodies, two of which were never aired. They very in intensity on the laugh meter from sort of lame to pretty funny, but they are not the reason I bought this video then are they?
For a VHS tape the overall Quality is pretty good. I found no flaws of problems with it. Even though a DVD of course would sound and look far superior my rating is based on VHS standards not DVD so relax, sit down on your ""couch of reasonable comfort"" and enjoy this jewel of a video.",990489600,2,2274,4.416666666666667
1386626,4,B000050ZF6,"When a classic TV show gets its first new episode in a decade, it has to be a good comeback, or a great parody. This falls into the latter category. The Curse of Fatal Death was a Comic Relief sketch done for charity, and the all-star cast does a terrific job at lampooning the classic Doctor Who series. The parody exists in two parts, with a cliffhanger ending for the first part, in tribute to the standard method for the show. Rowan Atkinson plays the Doctor, at least in the beginning, and captures the spirit of the character perfectly. In the course of the two episodes, which weigh in at just about 20 minutes, they nail everything from dalek bumps to time travel itself. The rest of the cast is excellent, from Johnathan Pryce, expertly overacting the role of the Master, to Joanna Lumley, who plays... well, let's save that for a surprise.

 The Fatal Death parody is only a short part of the tape. The rest of the tape is taken up with behind the scenes information about the making of the parody and interviews with cast members. There was no information about this in the purchasing information, and so I have to admit I was a bit disappointed at the brevity of the skit. But the humor is best delivered quickly, and a full-length parody would have to have been less enjoyable. The production segments are good, and the parodies at the end of the tape, while not as good as Fatal Death, will still strike a humorous chord with any fans of the show.

 This parody is definitely a valuable addition to any Doctor Who collection.",987465600,,1539,4.505376344086022
1386627,3,B000050ZF6,"This is a great video, although the tape I watched was defective and I had to take it back for an exchange.  From what I heard(on the staticy sound and shaky video) It seemed pretty darned funny, I don't know much how Rowin Atkins sounded though, his voice sounded like ""Scagroth"" from ""City of Death"" I am reviewing this because(from what dialogue I heard) it was off-the-wall funny and witty.  The sofa of reasonable comfort(sounds like mine) and the ""special"" way the Doctor and the Master communicated with each other.  The no-common sense Master repeatedly falling into the pit of dung and crawling out with a longer beard and wheezier breath each time; and of course the Doctor regenorating every five seconds, a sex-maniac, a shy-guy, and another handsome devil and finally a very interesting-looking woman(the master thought so). If you like Doctor Who and silliness and making fun of him at the same time, get this thing! If you are offended, Get a life! As for the other junk on the tape, I couldn't play it, I got tired of the hissing static.(I am going to get an exchange, NOT a refund; inother words, I LIKED IT)",986428800,,1125,4.671717171717172
1386628,4,B000050ZF6,"The primary content of this tape is not what the box would have you believe.  The bulk of the material is not actually ""The Curse of Fatal Death"".  Mostly this tape is a making-of vignette and a collection of three other brief DOCTOR WHO parodies.  You'll probably be a bit disappointed if you buy this thinking you were getting a full-length parody episode.
However, if you understand you're buying a product which showcases the lighter side of the longest-running science fiction television show in history, then you'll likely be well-pleased.
""The Curse of Fatal Death"" is itself incredibly good.  Its only real fault--its length--is actually a hidden strength.  Though its meager run time is unfortunate, this brevity also serves to tighten the comedy.  There's very little time to do much BUT laugh.  To be sure, DOCTOR WHO fans are going to get the most fun out of the piece, because they know what's being lampooned, but such a star-studded cast--including film stars like Hugh Grant and Jonathan Pryce--lends broader appeal to the general British comedy fan as well.  The piece, after all, was part of a much larger COMIC RELIEF effort.
After ""Curse"" ends, however, the tape becomes of greater interest to DOCTOR WHO fans.  A splendid ""making of"" vignette follows immediately.  It may be the only such work which is actually longer than its subject.  Chief amongst all the questions it answers is why all these celebrities were involved with this project in the first place.  For serious fans of the show, it's got lots of great material on how Daleks work and the best way to build a TARDIS set in your spare time.  But maybe most importantly, it shows that the reason ""Curse"" worked so well is that the people writing it were genuine fans of the show itself.  This point is amply underscored by the presence of three other sketches, which, with the possible exception of the previously unaired French and Saunders bit, mostly show how easy it is to make a bad parody.  Still, DOCTOR WHO completists will like to have even these sub-par sketches, because they only go to prove the point of DOCTOR WHO's longlived popularity.
[PARENTAL NOTE:  Though DOCTOR WHO is itself largely an inoffensive kids' show, ""The Curse of Fatal Death"" was written for an adult audience.  It was originally aired as a part of Comic Relief UK.  As such, it contains some sexual suggestion and slightly off-color humor which is unusual to the series as whole.]",985046400,16,2446,4.8389423076923075
1386629,4,B000050ZF6,"I just bought this tape yesterday afternoon, and I'm still chuckling over it. I had heard about this British Comic Relief special over a year ago, but never thought it would be released in the U.S. -- first of all because Doctor Who is considered something of a cult here (i.e., there's little or no money in it), and second because most American fans of the show take it so bloody seriously, they'd probably consider ""Fatal Death"" as an affront (as witness Star Trek fans' virulent reaction to Shatner's ""Get a life"" bit on Saturday Night Live). I'm overjoyed to see I was wrong on both counts. Not only have the BBC and Warner Bros. seen a profit potential in a U.S. release, but the reaction I've seen on this page is overwhlemingly positive. As to my reaction? Well...
Being a Blackadder fan as well as a Doctor Who Fan, I was delighted to see Rowan Atkinson in the title role here. He captures the Doctor's spirit perfectly -- sort of a cross between Paul McGann's look, John Pertwee's warmth and charm, and just a little bit of Pat Troughton's naughty-little-boy attitude. And what a brilliant coup, getting Jonathan Pryce to play the part of the Master! Not only is he a great actor (one of the most underrated British actors working today, and one I wish I could see more often), he is also great at playing villains (which you can see in both the Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies, and in Something Wicked This Way Comes, which has Pryce as the devilish Mr. Dark -- his confrontation with Jason Robards in this film is both chilling and electrifying). Here he gives the Master a perfect blend of Anthony Ainley's over-the-top bravado and Roger Delgado's brilliant, jovial menace -- yet Pryce puts just enough of his own not-inconsiderable talent in to make the role his own. Julia Swahala makes a creditable companion to the Doctor, though I can't quite understand why the Doctor would marry her -- she's got nice legs and everything, but they should have brought back Romana if they wanted to go that route. The other guest actors they brought in to play successive Doctor regenerations were all spot-on, from Richard E. Grant's ""lick-the-mirror-handsome"" incarnation to Hugh Grant's less-conceited-but-still-quite-handsome version. I also loved the use of Joanna Lumley at the end (""Oh, it's got three settings!""); it's a brilliant twist, and one can't help but wonder why they never tried it on the original series (as opposed to, say, Colin Baker).
As to the humor quotient -- well, I think my review title (which I quite frankly stole from Eric Idle) pretty much describes it. There are dozens of in-jokes here, craftily designed for longtime lovers of the show and its conventions/cliches (""Doctor, what's happening?"" ""I'll explain later.""); there are a brilliant series of time-travel gags early on, worthy of Douglas Adams at his most intricate -- and a few (ahem) ""bottom-burp"" jokes worthy of The Young Ones at their dirtiest. There are also some fine moments regarding the Master being ""augmented"" by the Daleks -- ""You don't even know what it does, do you?"" -- and a brilliant twist ending that echoes, of all things, the end of ""Some Like It Hot""! Overall, it's a riot.
If I have any complaints, it's that the darned thing is too short! At (barely) twenty minutes, it seems more like a tease than an actual program. If the humor content wasn't so rich, I might feel cheated...however, given the fact that the producers were working under a limited budget, using borrowed sets and busy actors, I guess I can understand the reason for ""Fatal Death's"" brevity. The BBC must have realized this too, for they've been generous enough to include a documentary about the making of the special (which is actually pretty good, though a bit superficial), as well as three Doctor Who spoofs from other sketch-comedy shows, the funniest of which is the last. (The first one is a French & Saunders sketch which was never aired, and it isn't hard to see why -- it's painfully unfunny. Still, it's better than Spike Milligan's terrible, racist Pakistani Dalek sketch from M6.) It all makes up for the shortness of ""Fatal Death"", though if the sketches had been less uneven I would be giving five stars here instead of just four. Even so, I'm just glad ""The Curse of Fatal Death"" was finally released, and as a longtime Doctor Who fan I'm proud to include this in my collection.",982886400,3,4379,4.755584756898817

7929193,5,B000050ZF6,"OK, they had The Three Doctors, the Five Doctors, and The Two Doctors, not to mention pairings of Doctors in the New Adventures and Missing Adventures. Well, how does five Doctors in a short comic special sound, especially if one of those Doctors is Rowan Atkinson?
The show mentions a lot of the cliches that made Doctor Who the show it was. To avoid program discontinuity or lengthy answers to questions, there's ""I'll explain later."" Then there's the escape up the ventilation shaft, endless gravel quarries. That's not to say the Comic Relief special disrespects Doctor Who, but merely has a lot of fun with it.
And talk about intentionally ridiculous dialogue! ""The deadly vengeance of deadly revenge."" And my personal favourite, ""Prepare for 300 miles of fear and feces.""
The end of episode I is a gag lifted from a scene in the revamped Star Wars, the part where Han Solo chases some stormtroopers on the Death Star and then...
Jonathon Pryce plays the Master (Evita, Tomorrow Never Dies, Stigmata) and probably has the most fun in this special. With the widow's peak and goatee, he's clearly modelled after Roger Delgado's Master, but he is really OTT, bringing about a manic megalomania that's exaggerated to amuse. He has the best lines here as well.
If they ever bring the show back, I'd nominate Julia Sawalha as a companion or a regular. Perky, gentle, bubbly, she's got the right stuff. I liked her here and in A Midwinter's Tale. More thrilling than an army of cybernetic slugs? Definitely. In simple terms, the most warm and lovable companion since Jo Grant.
And Rowan Atkinson or Hugh Grant would be perfect candidates to play the Doctor, although Hugh Grant has Hollywood commitments, and as much as I like the man, Rowan Atkinson seems to have peaked with Mr. Bean. Unless the show is spectacular and remains essentially British while still catering to Americans, a new series seems unlikely.
Wait, there's more. There's a making of documentary, Comic Relief Uncovered, that's about 26 minutes long. It's full of bloopers, behind the scenes stuff, interviews with the cast and crew, and clips from the original stories. I even found out how they make cobwebs, glue sprayed from an aerosol can. There are also scenes from amateur Doctor Who productions, and people who make TARDIS consoles and Daleks for them. It's a passion more than a mere hobby for these dedicated people.
 Then there are three Who sketches from British TV programs--French and Saunders, Victoria Wood On TV, and The Lenny Henry Show, all which total 14 or so minutes. We are so isolated from what little we get of British comedies, except for more successful ones like Monty Python, Are You Being Served?, Allo Allo, Keeping Up Appearances on PBS or A&E, or the few video releases without esoteric references that only a Briton would understand, that anything else seems exotic.
Anyway, the French and Saunders sketch sends up Colin Baker's Trial Of A Timelord story, with jabs at program continuity, and the robot dog K9. French and Saunders play two silly, flibbertigibbet actresses playing Silurians who give the director of the story headache after headache. Comment: the actor is obviously doing the Tom Baker Doctor, but he seems to have stolen his scarf from Harry Potter.
The Lenny Henry sketch of Oct. 1985 is another jab at the Colin Baker era, especially the cancellation crisis, technobabble, Cybermen, and Margaret Thatcher. It's brief but fun.
Any Doctor Who or Rowan Atkinson fan will appreciate this spoof special. I know I did.",1018569600,18,3534,4.919597989949748
7929194,3,B000050ZF6,"This is a spoof of the Dr. Who series, made as a fund-raiser for Comic Relief.  It stars several British comedy veterans: Rowan Atkinson (Blackadder); Julia Sawalha and Joanna Lumley (Absolutely Fabulous); Jonathan Pryce (as the Master); Oscar nominee Jim Broadbent, and Hugh Grant.  The story itself is pretty lame and not very funny, though it's interesting to see Joanna Lumley as a female Doctor.  Jonathan Pryce was especially good, but Rowan Atkinson was disappointing.  The Daleks also make an appearance.  Most of the video is devoted to interviews with the stars and creators about how the show was made.  This tape is for die-hard Dr. Who collectors only.",1016496000,3,665,5.055045871559633
7929195,4,B000050ZF6,"I love Mr. Atkinson's acting style and choices of roles, he's very cautious and it shows: he's usually in an average of 5 scenes per movie with a paragraph of dialogue to recite between them. He keeps me wanting more (I can't say that about any other actor in the world.)
I don't believe cameos will ruin his career (just a good title for this article) it just seems like they stunt his talents. It is because there aren't enough writers writing the kind of roles to his liking. He's a family man and his work usually can appeal to all ages, most movies can't fit that description these days. It's no wonder we only see cameos, he shows up where it counts.
The comedy central spoof is clever, Atkinson's Dr. Who really grasps the essence of what a time lord is about - a worldly mannered man who helps others time and again selflessly and discovers what he really needs in life and remains true to both. Through clever dueling dialogue, and a few well planned counter-traps he outwits the Master in his quest for love. Although the ending is clever it doesn't follow its initial plan.
If Dr. Who comes back on the CRT I'd like to see Rowan as the real 9th doctor, it suits him. He was genuie to this character like no other and it suited him.",1012262400,,1242,4.357758620689655
