5015011,5,B006RH3QNS,This was a great film and captured all that was going on here in Fort Worth at the time. All my high school sweethearts were in a garage band. I attended a few of the Teen a Go-Go events & my best friend's sister was a go-go dancer there. The music was nostalgic & when it was over I just wanted more. Well worth watching if you grew up in the 60s or were aspiring to be a famous rock band.,1338249600,,390,3.8271604938271606
8503575,5,B006RH3QNS,"Teen A Go Go is an honest effort to describe and preserve a musical cultural blip on the radar screen of the mid 1960s,  It primarily concerns the ""Teen Scene"" phenomenon that sprang up in and around Fort Worth Texas.  The video gets its name from a popular teen scene venue located at the Round Up Inn at the Will Rogers memorial center.  It's popularity resulted in satellite locations known as ""Action A Go Go"" and ""Holiday A Go Go"", all in Ft Worth Texas, and all sponsored by KFJZ Radio station, and MC'd by a host of KFJZ radio disc jockeys, among whom Mark Stevens was most prominent.
The video was intended to cover these venues, the bands, and the music in their heyday, which in reality, lasted from 1965 through 1968, and centered on Fort Worth.  my personal criticism of the video is that it goes too far afield including Dallas bands and others who were not participants, and in some instances were not even born.  That said, the producer and director, Mark Nobles and Melissa Kuykendal were compelled by circumstance to make these additions to the film, and in some instances, it adds depth and perspective to the overall story.
The main line of criticism i have heard from many, some disgruntled musicians included, is that this band or that band wasn't included.  For example one critical musician complained that good bands like ""The Crowd Plus One"" was excluded.  I would agree except that the window for this story was narrow, and some of the great groups like ""The Crowd"", came along a little later as did many many more fine bands.
This same critic also said that I ""rambled on"" about my ""glory days"" or something in that vein, and that ""real bands"" were out playing ""real gigs"" like ""frat parties"".  Really?  Come on guy, this was about ""Teen A Go Go"", not all the other jobs we played that included private parties, frat parties, AGGIE victory parties, night clubs, and honky tonks. Yes, we did all that, and more, but again, this was about the ""Teen Scene"".  And since a good part of the video featured myself and Larry Ruqmore of the Blue Notes, i'm sorry, but we were at the epicenter of ""Teen A Go Go""; my band ThElite (C) performed at the presser for the start of Teen A Go Go (and later became the house band), and the Blue Notes were the first featured band to play there.  Why, because we happened to be the big draws at the time.  As far as my ""rambling"" about ""glory days"", I'm still in awe of all the things we got to do in a relatively short space of time; the more notable of which included hanging out with some great musicians of the time, and performing in the same concert with the likes of the Beach Boys and The Byrds.  That all took place in the span of a couple of years as far as my participation was concerned, before going on to perform profesionally for the next several years playing ""real gigs"".
The video IS incomplete, and a lot of folks were left out.  But for a film of its length, Mark and Melissa did a credible job piecing something together from 40 plus years back, and luckily many participants were still alive and around. Funding or lack thereof meant that it was done over a period of four years; that takes guts and perserverence.
I rate it FIVE STARS because its the only thing like it around and it's GOOD.  And as for the critics, if you don't like the story or the way its done,, go do one yourself.

8503576,5,B006RH3QNS,"Once there was a time...
When young teens saw Rock and Roll as an alternative to sports and frats and blandness. It was intense. So glad the upheaval was caught on film in places like Texas. It was happening throughout the USA. In Texas they must have had more money; the music gear is better than it was in western New York.",1456185600,2,325,4.258064516129032
8503577,5,B006RH3QNS,Great DVD!  Just what I wanted!  Thanks!,1433980800,2,40,4.571428571428571
8503578,2,B006RH3QNS,"Not a very good documentary to start with.  The interviewer apparently did not dig very deeply into the subjects nor inspire the often poorly chosen interviewees to respond in any way other than superficial self-indulgent anecdotal prosaic diatribes about the glory days.  Reeking of Legends in their own mind syndrome at every turn, we are left with the vague impression that Fort Worth had some kind of magical super hero musical Renaissance that the rest of the world missed out on.  Somehow all of the ""incredible music"" and ""fantastic recordings"" and ""amazing bands"" never amounted to anything outside of the creators' own mental constructs.

I was there and in one of the bands (not mentioned in the film -there were others as well - Crowd + 1 for heavens sake!).  We seldom went to Teen A Go Go simply because we were off playing real gigs such as SMU and TCU frat parties, East Side Club, Lou Ann's and Strawberry Fields in Dallas and many others. The band I was in played everything from tunes off of ""Younger than Yesterday"" by the Byrds and selections from Sgt Peppers to Sam and Dave and James Brown.  Most of the bands in the film were covering teeny bop pop tunes and doing a poor job of it in my opinion.  In addition to being a rather goofy scene at the Roundup Inn -  the ""Teeny"" bands were usually well dressed, well equipped, well hyped (Mark E. Baby) guys with little talent but lots of personality - not to mention cheap wigs, elaborate stage antics and inflated fan club numbers.

There were a number of fellows sitting there not saying much (in the edited down version anyway) that I personally knew and played with that had a lot of interesting stories to tell I can assure you.  Instead, we are left with endless ramblings of Roger Brownlee attempting to convince himself as well as everyone else that the Elite were ""incredible"".

There were some pretty good bands at the time that the producers failed to mention. For the most part however, most all of the garage bands sucked.  I was 15-16-17 and fully aware even then how dreadful most of these combos were. The recordings made were unspeakably atrocious and we would cringe and make fun of the singles when played on KFJZ.  If you've any doubt, just listen to the background music.

I played at the Cellar a couple of times.  Trust me, it was a dump and nothing but a dump.  Sure, good music can be brewed from a dump as the Beatles demonstrated in Germany.  Good music can evolve out of a living room just as well.
Also, this idea that garages are a kind of generator of brilliant musicianship is a fantasy.  The acoustics are terrible.  Good musical performance sounds chaotic where less than stellar playing can almost sound like music at times with a little imagination.

These deluded knuckleheads should be ashamed for claiming that if the wind had blown another way, or if Epstein would have managed them, or if Major Bill hadn't screwed them etc.-  they too would have been superstars.  I watched in embarrassment.  Shut up and make music now.  Anyone can claim to have been great 40 years ago.  The thing is, we have the recordings to prove otherwise.",1386633600,2,3140,4.614414414414415
8503579,5,B006RH3QNS,Great one to watch on a rainy day! Many cool bands ae interviewed. Great insight on the 60's Texas garage scene,1375315200,2,111,4.333333333333333
8503580,5,B006RH3QNS,"Congratulations are due to Mark and Melissa for their hard work capturing the Ft. Worth music scene from the 60's on film. Lots of great lines (especially from John Nitzinger:-), clips of music from that era, and home movies capture the era well. Enjoyed all of the interviews. Well done!",1350864000,,288,4.78
8503581,5,B006RH3QNS,"I was introduced to this gem through a friend of mine.  After viewing, I became a big fan of this little known genre in American Pop Culture.  The music sampling is diverse and there were dozens of great tunes that should have become standard play, that never made it.  The GOOD NEWS is that most of these can still be purchased on CD.  This is a very important documentary, especially for music historians and all-consuming enthusiasts.  This corner of music needs a revival and I promise you'll agree, after soaking this work in.",1343692800,2,531,4.666666666666667
8503582,5,B006RH3QNS,This captures the essence of Ft. Worth Rock n Roll in the 1960s.  There's some great footage and interviews from people who were there!,1343692800,,135,4.625
8503583,5,B006RH3QNS,I really enjoyed learning about a musical movement right in my home town (Ft. Worth) that has national significance. I had no idea we had a GO GO scene! Of course I wasn't alive at the time. I bough a copy of this for my Mother who was raised in the area and did listen to the radio stations and knew of the local halls and hangouts covered in the film. She enjoyed receiving this gift. I think it reminded her of her youth. I liked seeing the behind the scene too. I got a kick out some of the record producer antics.,1339632000,,518,4.038834951456311
8503584,5,B006RH3QNS,"Growing up in Ft. Worth, I knew that Willie Nelson was a figure in the country music scene but I had no idea that this little pocket of Texas was such a thriving scene for garage rock. This documentary succinctly shows that the teens were the leaders in starting their own movement. They saw The Beatles and thought, ""why can't I do that?"" And they did! Hearing some of the stories makes me wish I had been around to see all the shows and experience the energy.",1339027200,,461,4.310344827586207
