7132365,5,B00WHZZFYC,"I originally watched this show on Crunchyroll and really enjoyed it. The characters are all interesting, and I hope there will be a second season, as I would like to see the story continue. If you are a fan, I would recommend purchasing this set. If you haven't seen this anime you might want to watch it before buying, it is available to watch for free on Crunchyroll.",1441756800,,369,4.4411764705882355

8713485,5,B00WHZZFYC,"While I'm sure it's only likely to appeal to male Yuri fans, it's still one of the cutest, sweetest, most endearing shows. Great comedy and just makes you smile. One of my favorite anime of all time. It would be too bad if all people got out of it was the surface level fan-service, because quite honestly, it's just a really sweet show. Nice to have anime about people who like each other and are good friends to each other.",1452816000,2,425,4.325
8713486,4,B00WHZZFYC,"Sakura Trick is a pretty enjoyable show for fans of both yuri and slice of life. It has some very nice direction and animation (thanks DEEN, and that's no joke), a very catchy opening theme, cute characters with fun interactions, and good payoff. It tends to tread themes and situations other shows have worn well, but it has enough of its own flair to mask the monotony.",1442534400,4,371,4.552238805970149
8713487,5,B00WHZZFYC,"Though i have really bought the series by volumes 1-6, costing around $400, it's a great series indeed about two friends exploring their relationship. Though they now surprised me with this, which this is a TON cheaper then what i payed for, though i wish they would make a blu-ray all-in-one version of Sakura Trick, then i would be happier. but i really can't complain.",1442275200,2,371,4.723076923076923
