3789189,4,B001TE6PGO,"What a fabulous deal! Four movies for the cost of one. If you love romances- this is for you!

""Another Woman"" is what inspired me to buy the set. I saw it years ago on TV and I loved it. Watching it again was well worth the cost. What an amazing movie! It's based on Another Woman (Harlequin Super Romance, No 558) by Margot Dalton and is about a woman who comes to in a hospital, with amnesia, and has to come to grips with life not knowing who she is. Her husband and sister-in-law treat her with disdain and it doesn't take her long to figure out that she might not have liked the woman she used to be. Rebuilding her relationships is a process that takes time. This beautiful movie always makes me cry too- it's a lovely tale of second chances and redemption and healing. I love all of the characters!! 5 Stars

""A Change of Place"" is based on Change of Place by Tracy Sinclair. It was, by far, my favorite of the films next to ""Another Woman."" It was fun to watch!! And more than a romance, it was a tale of sister love and family as well. It was cleverly done- based on the concept that two twins trade places for a month. A bookish PHd art student with her famous sister who is a party animal model. When her the model needs to go to rehab, her studious sister takes her place in Paris. Sounds a little out-there but was pulled off with surprising charm. Toss in a romance between the studious sister and her stumped employer/investor and wala, a cute and winning romance. I really enjoyed it and will watch again. 4 Stars

""Treacherous Beauties"" is based on Treacherous Beauties by Cheryl Emerson. This was a fairly good film and well worth watching at least once. I had a hard time accepting the premise and follow through. In this tale, a woman who is a journalist is investigating her brother's murder and insinuates herself into the lives of the family she believes may be connected or even responsible. It's pretty much a who-done-it tale with a chancy romance thrown in. The ""villain"" was pretty obvious immediately, however, and so the mystery wasn't too much fun. Also, the relationship between the hero and heroine seemed based more on chemistry than knowledge of each other. 3 Stars

""Broken Lullaby"" is based on the Harlequin Intrigue (no 191) of the same name, by Laurel Pace. Of the four films, this was by far my least favorite. Towards the end I had to pause the movie for something and I just never went back, if that makes sense. The story was about a genealogist who is investigating her own families history. And it connects with a Faberge egg which is worth millions- thus attracting attention from people who want to get their hands on the egg first.  The problem wasn't the plot so much as the actors. Mel Harris played a stiff, plain and listless woman who was hardly agreeable or likable. The man who played her love interest just seemed immature to me and equally unlikable. The acting seemed wooden and awkward. 1 Star

Overall, two stellar movies, one pretty good one and one stinker. Not bad for $10!! I highly recommend this set. Oh and no worries about the reviewers concerned with not getting the movies- it comes with two DVDs and there is one movie on each side.",1310428800,19,3204,4.4683760683760685
3789190,5,B001TE6PGO,"Another Woman - B+
This was a good movie but I didn't love it. Basicly this is a romance posing as a suspence story, but the suspense never really gets off the ground and the romance is nice but tempid. The heroine and hero are married but on the brink of divore, when the wife losses her memory everything changes and the husband finds himself falling back in love with her. Their romance is sweet but almost entirly based on what was and so the viewer only gets to see glimpses of their falling in love before all of sudden they both love each other again.

A Change of Place - B
Funny how a secon viewing can change things, when I first saw this movie I loved it and actually bought hte book and these movies because of it. After watching it again I couldn't remember what I liked about it. The acting which isn't really up to par with the rest of the HQ movies which is saying something. At the end of the movie in the scene that should be the big climax of the story the Rick Springfield appears to be unable to keep himself from laughing, which made what should have been an impassioned moment seem funny. The story is your typical twins switching place story, with a romance between two people that start off hating each other. I enjoyed the romance, but I didn't like how the end was resolved within about one minute.

Trecherous Beauties - A
I really enjoyed this movie. It has all the drama and passion you'd hope from a HQ story. Storyline aside this was just fun and indulgent and wonderful. Like the above the romance starts off as a hate, and yada yada yada the best movie in the set.

I have yet to watch the entire fourth movie and don't even remember it's name. What I can say is that the parts that I did see seemed very contrived. I think the difference between a good HQ movie and a bad one is that when it's good you know it's contrived but you love it, when it's bad the contrivancies just annoy you. Maybe when I see the hwole thing I'll change mind.",1304121600,2,1973,4.242021276595745

If you like romance novels or soap operas and appreciate having all your expectations filled--the good rewarded, the bad punished, the lovers united--you'll enjoy these films.

3789221,3,B001TE6PGO,"Oddly enough, I don't read Harlequin books; however, I thought these movies might be entertaining.  They are.  Some aren't the best quality of plot or acting, but they make up for it in retro value.  All of the movies are from 1994.  It's fun to see the clothes and some of the actors we haven't seen in a while.

There are four movies.  The DVD picture, color and sound quality are all pretty good.

- ""A Change of Place"" stars Andrea Roth (Rescue Me) and Rick Springfield (General Hospital).  It's the story of a good twin/bad twin or maybe I should say sober twin/drunk twin.  At any rate, the sober twin has to fill in as a fashion model for her drunk twin who is going to rehab.  The Paris (it's really Hungary) scenery is a nice touch; the acting- not that nice.  Still, it's enjoyable.  The Parisienne groove music is what fascinates me most about the movie.

- ""Broken Lullaby"" stars Mel Harris (Thirty-something).  A genealogist travels to Europe to find information on her family's past.  Surprise, surprise...she meets a handsome stranger.  It is Harlequin, after all.  The scenery is great in this one.  Mel is a bit stilted but the storyline is interesting.  A superficial note:  Mel wears skorts as she's tromping through Europe...this could be the very reason Europeans think we have no fashion sense.

- ""Treacherous Beauties"" stars Emma Samms (General Hospital, Dynasty), Catherine Oxenberg (Dynasty) and Bruce Greenwood.  For me, this was the goofiest of the bunch.  If you enjoy your romance with a side of Velveeta, then Bruce Greenwood should be your leading man.  Oh, the humanity!  His steamy, yet oh so creepy, gaze at Emma's character is enough to make me laugh out loud.  Add to that, his strange, floppy hair and you'll find me searching for something that I can poke my own eyes out with.

- ""Another Woman"" stars Justine Bateman (Family Ties).  A woman wakes up in a hospital to find she remembers nothing at all from her life.  Her husband is a stranger to her, and she has no idea why he seems to dislike her.  This is probably the best of the lot.  The intrigue is good.  The acting is better in this one than the others.  Justine is very endearing as she tries to figure out who she is and what she lost in her past.

All in all, you can't beat the price for these.  If you're looking for high-quality drama, you've made a wrong turn.  But if you like Harlequin or romance or pretty scenery, watch these for a little rainy-day fun.",1396483200,2,2464,4.558352402745996
