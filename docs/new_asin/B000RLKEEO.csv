8201328,4,B000RLKEEO,"Very graceful movements. I learned some helpful techniques, but have not become proficient in using forearms only.  No fault of the video.",1393286400,,138,5.2727272727272725
8201329,4,B000RLKEEO,"I was unableto take a forearm massage class that was held here recently.  In order to exchange with another therapist, I needed something to study.  This dvd was a good introduction and way to study.  Really useful.  would like to see more moves in an advanced edition.",1332115200,2,269,4.659574468085107
8201330,5,B000RLKEEO,"I think this is video should be required viewing for all massage therapist.  It's a little hard to explain what sets apart Val Guin's techniques from other forearm techniques.  It took me a little while to understand, Ms. Guin's concept of the hook and the use of the olecranon, but once you get the hang of it you see that she takes forearm work to a whole different level.  Even the instructors form the many Lomi Lomi DVD's that I have watched, don't use forearm techniques that are as developed or as sophisticated Ms. Guin's.  Even if you aren't planning to use solely Forearm work or practice Lomi Lomi, you should learn these techniques.  They will take your massage work, being able to go as deep as any client would want, to a higher level.  You will also be able to perform more massage without wearing your self out because you will be using much more efficient techniques.",1330732800,8,884,4.563291139240507
8201331,4,B000RLKEEO,"As a massage therapist I found this ""dance"" both refreshing and extremely hopeful for a longer career without wearing out our precious hands.

Just a pity that Val doesn't run any training courses here in Europe!

Congratulations on a wonderful compilation!",1281225600,8,257,5.2439024390243905
8201332,5,B000RLKEEO,"This DVD is the best (bar none) on the market for working with the forearm. Not only is it a well produced film, but unlike the other DVD on the market, this one provides a comprehensive instruction section. The other DVD on the market does not provide an instruction section outside of their full body massage demonstration using the techniques. Conversely, Guin's DVD provides a full body massage demonstrating the techniques, but has an additional section providing detailed instruction while mentoring others using her techniques.

The other major DVD using the forearm is shallow and relies on many moves one learns in a basic massage school. I won't name that DVD, but I've been doing this work for over ten years, and bought the other major DVD on this subject; the techniques provided in that DVD are not unique to its producer, but are techniques used in most entry level massage programs.

Guin's DVD is unique, creative, and distinct.  Which is to say, I have never seen most of the techniques she uses in this work. That ought to tell you a lot. This is simply the best DVD on the market advancing the forearm for any massage therapist who may want to still be effective in their practice, but also wants to save their joints, thumbs, and wrists without losing client satisfaction. In fact, my clients refer others routinely. They like the work.

I am a NCTMB therapist and certified in numerous other modalities: western and Eastern.

I would also recommend the Easlen DVD's produced by Ms. Watson. In her DVD you will find many creative and unique movements using the forearm.",1276473600,2,1590,4.809523809523809
8201333,5,B000RLKEEO,This video is great. I still haven't incorporated all of the techniques and it still saves my hands a lot of fatigue.,1246838400,8,117,4.363636363636363
