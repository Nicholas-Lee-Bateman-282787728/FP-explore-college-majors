6247743,4,B00I2YXMWE,"I enjoyed this film and fully met my expectations. There aren't many films available featuring Ottoman Turks and the sets, locations and costumes were fantastic. Maybe 35% of movie is war/combat, but the politics of Ottoman and Byzantine rulers were explored and well handled, excellent overall. This was the first movie I'd purchased produced in Turkey, and the quality is excellent. They don't make movies like this in Hollywood. This version of the movie, originally titled Fetih 1453, is dubbed (well done) in English making the story much easier to follow.  On par with period films coming out of Poland and Russia and well worth having in the inventory!",1404691200,13,659,5.045871559633028

6247746,3,B00I2YXMWE,"This is a Turkish view of the fall of Constantinople. The battle scenes were dramatic complete with impressive exploding fire and gore.  The ending was the typical Islamic benevolent liberator delivering the peasants from their barbaric Christian leaders. The Sultan actually walks into the Hagia Sophia alone into a large crowd of Christians, picks up a child and holds it lovely as the adoring folks stand gazing at this heroic victor.  Little hard to stomach after reading what really happened.",1402099200,36,497,5.2

But characters are flat, absurdly predictable and, most importantly, it is all a total rubbish from historical point of view.

Good hearted, kind and monogamous, if you believe the movie, Ottoman Sultan.

Very bad Byzantine, which stubbornly does not want to be conquered by surrounding her by that time Ottoman Empire. How dare these Greeks to resist. Shame on them.
And bad-bad-bad Byzantine emperor even looks as evil as Cruella Devile in Disney cartoon.

But then I realized, it's really a comedy!  From the poorly developed characters to the way too obvious foreshadowing, by the end this movie had me laughing.  Unfortunately, it is not even a good comedy, and this is of course at the expense of time which I will never see again (shedding a tear).",1476057600,,472,4.329545454545454

6247773,2,B00I2YXMWE,"This movie was somewhat entertaining.  I would have given it 3 stars, but subtracted one star since the obvious attempt at Islamic propaganda detracted from the film itself.  Wardrobe and settings for the movie are very good, and it is certainly epic in some respects.  It is hard to judge the acting in this film, but it certainly is not bad.  However, the movie fails when measured against historical accuracy.

At the time of its fall, Constantinople had only somewhere over 5,000 defenders versus an estimated 60,000 to 80,000 Ottoman aggressors.  Possibly the greatest historical inaccuracy involves the ending of the movie, where the Ottoman's were depicted as merciful liberators, and greeted with joyful wishes by those in Constantinople who had locked themselves inside the church of Hagia Sophia.  In reality, upon entering the church, Turkish troops divided up survivors based on what price they wold command in the slave markets.  In all, of the roughly 50,000 estimated to live in Constantinople when the siege began, 30,000 survivors were deported or enslaved.",1471564800,,1074,5.203488372093023

I don't know what was worse, the quality of the audio from the narrator, what the narrator was saying, or how the narrator was saying things.  Movie slower than molasses and the epic battle was as epic as doing your taxes and getting two paper cuts on the same finger in the process.

6247793,1,B00I2YXMWE,"This is nothing else but a Turkish Propaganda based on a total misrepresentation of a historical event. Every single aspect of the movie was meant to justify the conquest of Constantinople. The revenge of a girl who lost her village and family to vicious and barbaric christians, Christian leaders who where not reliable partners, all of which was put in contradiction with the youth, strength, strategically superior and divine inspiration of the Sultan. The ending shows the dramatic raising of the flag by an Ottoman soldier who made the ultimate sacrifice by giving his life despite his superhuman strength and conviction. He does so while his poor girlfriend, pregnant with the child he will never know, watches on. Then of course, the Usual Islamic benevolent and charismatic leader who walk in the church as a deliverer of the oppressed peasants in a savagely cruel christian civilization. And despite the ""injustice and pain"" he had suffered, the Sultan enters  the Hagia Sophia in a humble manner, to meet and greet a crowd of Christians who had sought refuge. Right away their fears are alleviated, children are hugging and kissing him while the crowd watches on with admiration. It is just so far form the truth that I really feel generous as I rate this movie a one star. Who knows, Maybe we will also watch a movie on how Turkey ""liberated"" Armenia or how the black Inhabitants of North Africa ""chose"" to ""invite"" Arabs to take their lands so they can be sold as slaves in the Arab world.",1464566400,20,1501,4.817829457364341
6247794,1,B00I2YXMWE,"This was a ""puff piece"". Pretends to be based on history, but no serious historian would consider it legitimate. Constantinople is portrayed as rich and decadent. Not true. It was emaciated after 1300 years and gravely poor. Constantine XI was not a debauched hedonist. He was a religious celibate. And, history is assualted more as the story line progresses. Little more than another call to arms for modern  muslim zealots against those beastly, murderous infidel crusaders.",1464566400,,476,5.2631578947368425

Movie appears to be well funded, good special effects, especially of Constantinople is cityscape, but it is badly dubbed, has a rather lame love triangle between two nearly identical guys (one Christian, one Muslim) that massively detracts from the story line. I was expecting a bad Islamic Propaganda movie, and was surprised it tried to show the Byzantines off most of the movie as rational and not backwards, but was badly dissapointed with it giving in towards the end, that the Greeks really were okay with being conquered and having their self esteem lifted at being smiled at after having been Jihaded.... it's idiotically gullible, Ottomans of this era are ISIS today, in in the Ottoman case, they destroyed a very ancient civilization. I assure you, Greeks then and now would react in such a manner. I doubt the Ottomans had been that one dimensional either.... a lot of missed opportunities.

6247835,4,B00I2YXMWE,"I read some histories of Constantinopole, pretty much 1453. The last Constantine was not really the best emperor. In some views the Eastern empire was degenerating already before the Muslim conquest (just like Jerusalem). The defenses were old and not its prime during that time. It was been sieged and attempted for a very long time. Their gameplan is the same over and over every time they are attacked. Mehmet was a rising leader and his empire is expanding. In order to gain resources his empire has to conquer, I had nothing against the Muslim conqueror he was the rising star of his era. Constantinopole is dawning and old with its allies crumbling, the fall of an empire begins at the borders and that's what happened first. Their were a few prediction before the fall happened, the ominous comet, where the emperor's coin are minted just filled the last spot for Constantine II. Who could cross the ships though the great Horn shall conquer and so on. Taking the Muslim view of the event gives you the other perspective but this is how Empire crumbles. Starts from the periphery and decays from the inside, being conquered is just an excuse, but it was already falling apart.

6247849,4,B00I2YXMWE,"There are almost no movies dedicated to such an important entity in the history of Europe and the Middle East as it is the Ottoman Empire. This is a good first step. The battle scenes are presented in a very impresive fashion. While there are a few subplots, plenty of time is devoted to the main characters and the politics and tactics of the siege. The romantic subplot whitin the movie is not impresive but neither bad enough that takes away from the quality of the movie. The ottoman emperor is portrayed in a little to positive a way. The greatest weakness of the movie is the end where the sack of constantinople is substitued by a loving sultan adressing a smiling crowd. A very good movie but short of great because of this historical innacuracies,nevertheless I still recommend it. Hopefully more and better movies will be made in the future about the history of the Ottoman Empire.",1407456000,21,891,4.6455696202531644

All of the CGI used was a bit distracting. I don't know how they can say they filmed on location when everything in the location was digitally produced. The voice acting was horrible; there really should have been an option to listen to the original cast and had subtitles.",1528502400,,413,4.594594594594595

8638457,3,B00I2YXMWE,"Heavy-handed and pompous, this is still a work of labor and love. It is on a moral level in film-making with U-571 or Gone With The Wind. Constantinople's fall is indeed a neglected topic, worthy of an epic movie or a TV series. The sets and costumes are great, and sometimes the dialogue is potentially interesting. But in whole, it is stiff or confusing and considering the topic, not very dramatic or moving. Also the inaccuracies seem to be designed specifically to provoke Greeks.",1512000000,,485,4.785714285714286
8638458,1,B00I2YXMWE,"An unforgiveably twisted mis-representation of a historical event, apparently meant to portray the attackers as as good, and the victimized Christian empire's leaders as bad. The writer and producer perhaps forgot to study history first.",1501718400,2,237,5.8
8638459,4,B00I2YXMWE,"Let's be clear: the film portrays an event of such foundational importance in human history that it is ridiculous that so little is produced about this event. The historical event has everything Hollywood could want -- violence, romance, desperate odds, new inventions and ideas, daring tactics and very, very big ordinance. The Ottoman conquest of Constantinople is the defining event that kicks-off the Age of Discovery at the outset of the early modern world, and finally ends a thousand-year-old empre. This is a story everyone should be familiar with. However, learning it from this movie is a little risky, as some other reviews suggest.

This is an English dubbing of ""Fetih 1453"" from its original Turkish, the most expensive film in Turkish cinema history (according to Wikipedia). To put the current project in prospective, director Faruk Aksoy made a Turkish John Wayne-style movie -- full of nationalistic zeal without worrying too much about balance or the other's perspective and perfect willingness to smooth over the rough spots of that perspective. So instead of the fascinatingly complicated Sultan Mehmet II -- in parts brutal and progressive -- you're left with a two-dimensional hero from central casting. And to give him a worthy advisory, the hapless Constantine XI is portrayed as decadent, powerful and out of touch whereas impoverished, desperate and overwhelmed would be closer to the point (picture sending out your guard to extract donations from the wealthy to pay your Genoese mercenaries). Keep in mind, most history is nationalistic in nature, though, with a primary goal to be justifying current policies or attitudes. So filter for that.

That said, I hope there is more to come. A lot of the stuff in here really is inspired by actual historical events -- like those huge cannon, and the painful portage of the navy to open up a new front. If people get excited about this history, maybe they'll be excited about the other sides of this history, and subsequent events (""Magnificent Century"", for example, a multisession tele-drama about Sulieman the Magnificent is only available on Youtube currently [edit: now also on Netflix]).",1491609600,5,2166,5.168091168091168
8638460,1,B00I2YXMWE,"Wow. Revisionist history at its worst. Painting Turks as the good guys is like saying that Hitler ""liberated"" Poland. Total Islamist propaganda.",1490745600,2,144,5.590909090909091
