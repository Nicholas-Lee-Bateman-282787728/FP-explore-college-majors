8740657,5,B017TJZTYQ,Delivery was quick and the dvd well restored and interesting.,1534291200,,61,5.2
8740658,5,B017TJZTYQ,"The show has film I haven't seen before. It was well organized.

It's from 1961, and the narration does not try at all to be objective or low key. I wasn't bothered by it, though I read that it irritated a couple other reviewers. To me, it seemed appropriate for a German program made just a decade or so after the war.",1478995200,,319,4.145161290322581
8740659,4,B017TJZTYQ,Great actual footage of this time in history,1458000000,,44,4.625
8740660,4,B017TJZTYQ,"Very engaging 2-hour condensation of World War II in Europe, from the beginning of Hitler's rise to the end. Recommended for the younger generation -- the horror of World War II was so great that it is almost beyond imagination in our current world.",1457395200,,249,4.681818181818182
8740661,5,B017TJZTYQ,Can't get enough of Hitler/Nazi Germany/Third Reich material. This film does not disappoint.,1454544000,,92,6.153846153846154
8740662,3,B017TJZTYQ,"The title of this film is deceiving. It addresses only the life of Hitler as a the leader of the Nazi's. In this respect it is not among the most outstanding films I have seen.  It states the facts accurately, but does little to explore the psyche of Hitler that the title of the film might suggest. That being said, I watched it to its conclusion, because it is important for human beings to be reminded that they are also capable of such depravity given the right circumstances.",1375401600,,480,4.454545454545454
8740663,5,B017TJZTYQ,Theres soo much about this time period and this man that are interesting. at once the great tumult in the history of man kind. It also changed this country from a of the people type of system to a governmental control and ie.. secret hidden from the masses and big business began their take over.,1368489600,,296,4.4
8740664,4,B017TJZTYQ,I agree with the above posts that there is quite a bit of footage that is not widely available but the commentary is distracting. It is gratuitously insulting and plays prophet to Hitlers every move and motivation. Hitler=bad....we get it. Just stick to the facts and let the viewer decide what to do with it.,1363219200,2,309,4.636363636363637
8740665,5,B017TJZTYQ,"This was an eye-opening documentary that people need to see.  Tyranny doesn't come when accountability and truth exist, it comes in the absence of them!",1355875200,3,152,5.08
8740666,5,B017TJZTYQ,A very strong collection of film history. Much of this film I have not seen before. There are many film clips in this I have not seen before.,1353196800,3,141,4.071428571428571
