1826616,4,B0000844IH,"James Cameron, for lack of a better phrase, was on top of the world after Titanic came out. The biggest cinematic gamble at the time, it went on to score 11 Oscars and get a domestic profit of 600 million, the highest ever. Then he kind of dropped off the map, well sort of. Since then he made 3 deep sea dive documentaries and a short-lived tv show. After his Titanic documentary Ghosts of the Abyss, he made Expedition: Bismarck which chronicles the sinking of a german war ship during WWII.

During World War II, the German forces had a ship called the Bismarck, which was a very formidable battleship. After it sank a British clip, they got a bit angry and decided an all-out assault on the ship. A lucky shot nailed the propeller, crippling it and sending it in circles, allowing British fleets to sink it. This film centers around recreating the sinking and allowing James Cameron and other divepeople to explore the wreck.

One of the things that's always interesting with re-creating mysteries is when they have little demonstration videos to show just what happened in a kind of CSI-like fashion. So when they talk about shells rupturing hulls and the ship sliding you're kind of ""huh?"" but the CG videos allow you to see it in clear detail, without the water's murkiness.

One thing that's thankfully kept to a minimum, which later film Aliens of the Deep suffered from is when people go ""wow that's great, wow that's awesome!"". There's a couple of scenes like it here but it's not as intrusive so it's more basic and to the point. Granted a jellyfish with a translucent scarf is going to bring about such reactions but then again an 800 ft ship damaged and on the bottom of the ocean should bring the same reaction.

It's a well-made documentary from a guy who did quite a few. To see a representation of war in its most horrible form and revisit it is quite compelling and the fact that it was a German ship Hitler actually visited but without being finger waving throughout the film was a nice touch.",1141430400,3,2013,4.56786703601108
1826617,4,B0000844IH,"While I agree with the limitations of this DVD mentioned by other reviewers, and even though James Cameron is, well, not a guy I'd care to have over for dinner, this is a worthwhile video if you have young boys AND if you've already seen the very good 1960 British movie 'Sink the Bismarck.'  It's a great followup to a compelling story about how the Bismarck threatened the lifeblood of civilization, and how the good guys beat the odds and sunk her.  Cameron's expedition allows for good talk with children about how wars are tragic even when they need to be fought, how young people die, sometimes horribly, and how the survivors afterwards can indeed be friends.  Even though the Germans in that war were our enemies, they are our friends now and we can respect and honor the sacrifice they made for their country, even while we recognize that their cause was evil.",1130803200,3,869,4.62987012987013
1826618,3,B0000844IH,"Being a history buff and interested in sunken ships, I had missed the television showing of this film on the Discovery Channel due to other commitments. So I ordered the DVD and anxiously awaited its release to that format. Rewatching it recently, I have to say it is mildly disappointing. The underwater footage is excellent, but there isn't enough of it. The history of the ship and sinking is decent, but not extensive. The recreations are well made, but at times out of place. The interviews with survivors pretty moving and helpful, but don't add as much as pure narration could have. Some of the questions about the sinking and final fate of the ship are brought up ambiguously and, apparently resolved, yet not convincingly and in an anti-climatic fashion. Overall, I didn't get the amount of pure footage of the sunken ship that I expected. The bonus materials on the second disc are essentially worthless. The main complaint? More underwater footage was needed to make this worthwhile.",1079308800,25,994,4.9226190476190474
1826619,3,B0000844IH,"I originally saw this documentary on The Discovery Channel and thought it was pretty interesting. The first disc consists of the program itself and starts/ends with a meeting of survivors of the battle from both sides.
Some of the German survivors actually went on Cameron's expedition to the wreck site, they gave advice on best robot camera entry points & so on. I thought the reenactment scenes looked very good (see disc 2 for a behind the scenes segment on that)as did some of the computer animated segments. Perhaps the most interesting point made was the contention that evidence indicated that the Bismarck's crew scuttled the ship, as they claimed, and most of the British Naval gunfire was ineffectual at best.
Disc 2 was actually more interesting to me with it's  many segments of computer animation illustrating various parts of the battle & the sinking of the Bismarck. There's a section of multiangle video views of the ship, that's a joke because while there are some interestinng wreck pictures I could not get the claimed multi angle function to work",1076371200,11,1067,4.927777777777778
1826620,5,B0000844IH,"I was able to watch this documentary when it was playing at Discovery Channel and I was impressed, at first time, i thought about the motives of James Cameron to do all that Titanic efforts again,going to the North Atlantic and gathering, financing all the submersible technology, experts and survivors, just o see how this legendary ship rests at two and a half miles deep. Then it was clear to me, that probably little Jimmy its cooking something that has the necessary power and history, to fill theaters all over again and beat once more the box office records. Mind my words when I say to you, that Cameron obsession for sink vessels is not over yet.
Bismarck is just a super documentary, two ours at the most pure James Cameron style. Probably this is the best war documentary I have ever seen, not just for the power of the history but for the extraordinary revelations behind this sinking.",1055980800,6,897,4.647798742138365
1826658,5,B0000844IH,"Enjoyed the presentation and all the history, especially the comments by the survivors.  The special features could have been improved.",1368489600,,135,5.75
1826659,5,B0000844IH,"Never mind that the ""flashback"" footage was filmed aboard the U.S. Battleship USS North Carolina, James Cameron has created another masterpiece with this film. Expedition Bismarck is the best Bismarck documentary I have ever seen! James not only dives deep, but he also digs deeper into the mystery surrounding Bismarck's destruction. In this film he goes inside and all around the wreck and films places and things on this ship not seen (mostly) since 1941. He also puts to rest (in my opinion) the long lasting controversy of who actually dealt the final blow that sunk this once mighty ship; the British or the Bismarck's crew. This documentary is a must see!",1324944000,2,662,4.919642857142857
1826660,4,B0000844IH,"While I had always been aware of the Bismarck and her place in the history books, I had not really studied it in greater detail up until now. Decades ago it was characterized as the 'best in class', but more recent histories have set its place more realistically compared to other Battleships. The one thing that has always stayed with this ship was its tremendous armor protection that was revealed by how much of a beating she took before sinking , which was attributed to the 'Krupp armored steel' used. But superficial examination of the Bismarck's much quoted armor thickness figures revealed that 'newer' battleships had greater thickness and thus better armor. This had threatened the Bismarck's invincible mystic.

After some Internet reading and research, I had discovered Garzke and Dulins ""Axis and Neutral Battleships in World War II"". This revealed the schematics of Axis armor lay outs, which pointed to an interesting finding compared to similar armor schematics in allied warship designs [two other volumes by the above authors]. Most modern Battleships had been built with the ""all or nothing"" armor theory, but the German warships followed a different armor scheme that looks essentially like `spaced armor' one would expect on modern tank armor.

This DVD was important in confirming how much better this type of armor offered. The DVD shows how the subs mini ROV was able to examine the inside of the hull bottom along its entire length where the torpedo bulkhead is. This area was blown away when the ship impacted the crater and slid down the mountain. This revealed that none of the torpedos that had perforated the Bismarck's outer hull, were able to also penetrate the inner torpedo bulkhead, which one would normally associate with sinking a warship. Not only that, but it seems that only a couple of the gigantic British shells that hit the Bismarck's hull, also penetrated the inner armor scheme to reach the engine room and then only at very short range. It seems that if none of the torpedos completely penetrated into the hull, then the ship must have been sunk by other means. The only other explanation is the often-reported claim of the Bismarck survivors, that they scuttled the ship to prevent it falling into enemy hands and end the murderous bombardment they were subjected to.  This DVD plus Ballard's earlier work on the Bismarck wreck seem to confirm the German account of this event.

All in all a worth while DVD to have.",1275782400,2,2464,4.915865384615385
1826661,5,B0000844IH,"now i have not scene the dvd of this program, but i did watch its original airing, and as a WW2 buff my self. the bismarck has been something i have enjoyed learning about. as for a comment on lack of underwater footage. this program had tons of it. watch any other documentory on this great story in history and you will only see the smallest snap shots fo this battleship. on this program you will see wide sweeping shots, and finaly see thr true size with the sea born monster the truely shook the seven seas, even in its short life. and for the ambiguous answers to its demise, also very untrue. with clear imiages of the intact interior hull ins every breach, is proof, the british did not sink the bismarck.",1195257600,,713,4.368421052631579
1826662,5,B0000844IH,"I can't get enough of documentaries like this one. I highly recommend Bismarck to WWII history buffs out there as well as those interested in lost vessels and undersea exploration (also those Clive Custler fans out there like myself). The recreations were fantastic and having contributions from some of the actual German survivors really added depth to this top-notch production.

Another DVD worth owning for the Cameron/historical adventure enthusiast is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lost-Tomb-of-Jesus/dp/B000OHZJSC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lost Tomb of Jesus</a>",1178323200,,623,7.090909090909091
1826663,4,B0000844IH,"modern technology meets world war II era saga.  being of german descent, i've always held a fascination with the bismarck.  well presented documentary -- historical facts, modern technology, involvement of actual survivors, etc.  a brave ship who fought against overwhelming odds . . . AND finally good to set the record straight .... she WAS scuttled by her own crew.",1173312000,,368,5.1
1826664,4,B0000844IH,"If you want to know the whole journey of Bismarck better, ""The Search for the Battleship Bismarck"" by NG is the choice. This one is about the analysis of its sinking based on the wreck.

The animation is pretty cool and successful for the illustration. The film is more movie-style than documentary and some parts are very similar to the movie ""Titanic"" by James Cameron.

In my opinion, the main contribution of this film is to settle down the dispute about if the British sank or the German scuttled the Bismarck. Without this, I shall rate this film three stars.",1170547200,,565,4.64
1826665,5,B0000844IH,"The fact that this was an excellent documentary is beside the point after having read some of the strange reviews here. For example, Nicholas Dujmovic said how Bismarck was threatening the very lifeblood of civilization. A bit dramatic there buddy? If my memory serves me right, it was England who declared war on Germany and not the other way around. And when you said the good guys BEAT THE ODDS and sunk her, which odds were you talking about? The entire British fleet vs. one ship? Wow dude, dunno how the British did it. And stop talking about having young boys around, you're creeping me out.

As for Mr. Dilam Mattia, go watch Jerry Springer and leave Cameron alone. He's made enough money to buy a small country if he wanted to, and if his passion is to go and shoot underwater documentaries on sunken ships then more power to him.",1161043200,2,839,4.556291390728477
1826666,5,B0000844IH,"If you ever truly wanted to know what happened on that tragic day that the awe inspiring Bismarck sank beneath the waves of the Atlantic ... this documentary is for you!

A titan amongst ships, technologically leaps ahead of her time, she was still a graceful lady ... just armed to the teeth! Allied naval experts during the war classified her as being the best floating gun platform worldwide. The British reacted accordingly: ""Sink the Bismarck at all cost!""

Excellent computer animations give insight into how people of the day must have seen the ship: from her maiden voyage, her passing through the Nord-Ostseekanal to her final days in the Atlantic.

However, this documentary also proves that the British covered up the truth for decades, claiming a victory that was not theirs.

This review was written with the deepest honor to the fallen on both sides: the Bismarck and the HMS Hood.",1149552000,5,895,4.868421052631579
1826667,5,B0000844IH,I do not know which program was being watched by the reviewers who say there is no information or substance in this documentary. This is by far the best documentary on the Bismarck and the Battle of the Denmark Strait ever filmed. Not only do you see the most awesome footage ever shot of this legendary ship but they bring back undeniable proof that answers the biggest question about this epic event in maritime history. They prove conclusively that the German crew's claim that they scuttled the ship was absolutely true. The ROV entered the area of the hull where the Dorsetshire's torpedoes hit and showed that they did not even scorch the paint on the inner armour belt much less penetrate it. Cameron also does not gloss over the fact that the British continued to mercilessly pound the ship and butcher helpless men for more than an hour after the Bismarck had lost the ability to return fire. It is easy to understand why the decision was made to scuttle the ship.,1146873600,16,973,4.630057803468208
7978971,5,B0000844IH,"If you've been fascinated by the ship, it doesn't get better than this.  A little over the top (a deathstar?) but it more than makes up for an occasional misstep.

7978974,5,B0000844IH,"I have owned this DVD for years but never put a review up before.  I read all the other reviews and thought I would put my 2 cents in.  First off, I noticed no other reviewer or Cameron himself seems to pay respect to Dr. Robert Ballard and his crew, who found the Bismarck and the Titanic in the first place and were the first to film both wrecks.  Secondly, that is not a bad thing at all, since Cameron has so much money he can go back down to the ocean's bottom, give us more detail and shots and sort of take us to the next level of these famous shipwrecks. So all in all it's a win-win for a history buff like me.  Since Cameron's documentaries came later than Ballard's on these two ships, we get better technology, greater detail and in this film's case...widescreen to look awesome to look terrific on our 16 x 9 flat screens.  The 2nd disc is kind of weak as most of it is shown on the first disk, but I'm glad they at least had maybe 20 minutes on disc two worth watching.  Cameron does mention Ballard in a very brief moment on the special features disk about part of the stern Ballard found but Cameron did not. All in all, I love and soak up this stuff like a sponge.",1424908800,,1181,4.113043478260869

7978978,3,B0000844IH,story and production good but expected more original footage. disappointment when DVD would not play on three machines and kept coming up (not for this region) and I had vision of lost money but found a friends machine that would play it .As I ordered the DVD for an Australian address you would expect it to play in that region.,1390694400,,329,4.5
7978979,5,B0000844IH,"Mr. Cameron has done an outstanding job of unearthing facts, unlike some submersible pilots who bored us with their adjectives.
On the sinking: one schematic showed a torpedo hitting and blowing off part of the outer skin of the ship. Was that the same piece of skin that Mr. Cameron found? Without question the British made two holes in the ship, both shown in the video. One at the bow make by the Prince of Wales and one at the stern made by a Swordfish torpedo. Agreed? Who made the other holes (if any) that caused the ship to sink? Scuttling? Maybe but where is the evidence? What part of the video showed the result of the scuttling?
Nothing has been covered up because no one knew what really had happened. Mr. Cameron reported that 40% of the lower hull was blown off. Was this the result of hitting the bottom or the result of (massive) scuttling charges?  Remember guys that when the USS MAINE was sunk in Cuba (?) harbour in 40ft of water the USN Navy spend a fortune recovering the whole ship to prove the reason for the sinking. In the event they were unable to prove anything.
Mr. Cameron's video is the best so far on the BISMARCK.",1384646400,,1147,4.410377358490566
