8381504,4,B002USF1V8,"First let me tell you that this review contains a spoiler, so, do not read if you don't want to know what happens in this movie. I was quite impressed when I saw El Conquistador de la Luna on a matinee, back in 1961. Now, 51 years later I understand why. The movie makes extensive use of stock footage from Irving Pichel's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Destination-Moon/dp/B000YSR01U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Destination Moon</a>Destination Moon and from the soviet movie Road to the Stars. Every time the spaceship takes off, land and during the space walk scenes what wee see is footage from Destination Moon and Road to the Stars.
The story is pure space opera. Antonio Espino plays Bartolo, a young inventor in love with Stelita(Ana Luisa Pelufo), the beautiful daughter of an absent minded professor. The professor built a spaceship that can go to the Moon and back using a new fuel. Bartolo goes aboard to talk to Stelita, press the wrong button and the young couple take off to the Moon. Landing in the Moon they are captured by martian lizard people who look remarkable like the Slistack from Land of the Lost. The martians are ruled by a disembodied brain with a cyclope eye that plans to destroy Earth with a doomsday missile. The brain also wants to take over the body of Stelita. Bartolo swallows a pill that makes him invisible and saves his girlfriend from a destiny worst than death. The lovers flee from the Moon and use the escape from the rocket engine to destroy the roving eye and kill the evil brain, very much like Ripley destroyed the monster in Ridley Scott's Alien.
Everything is played for laughs, but many elements in Jose Maria Fernandes screenplay would appear later in serious horror movies. The alien brain would be back in Ib Melchior Journey to the seventh planet. And the four armed martians look like the creatures in last year Cowboy and Aliens. My four stars go for the creative screenplay and the charming leading lady. The DVD copy looks sharp and clear, very good for a 52 years old movie. By the way the same footage from Destination Moon would be used again in Irwin Allen's The Time Tunnel.",1325635200,6,2180,4.9105691056910565
