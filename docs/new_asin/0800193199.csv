7795854,1,0800193199,"Parts 2 & 3 are Citizen Kane-caliber classics compared to this dross. Uses same plot of demented chainsaw family terrorizing a hapless group (this time teens on prom night). More like a remake than a sequel,  unpleasent instead of scary, and a surprising lack of chainsaw action (once  or twice i think, i dare not watch again to find out). But all of that is  nothing compared to the ludicrous government conspiracy (which is the  closet thing to a merit that this film has). Forget fearing the original  this is the movie to be afraid of; avoid at ALL costs. What do you expect  for a flick that collected dust on the selves for 4 yrs. before seeing  video release? This version (original called The Return of the Texas  Chainsaw Massacre), unfortunately, restores about 10 min. of cut footage. A  travesty to the original, that surprising was written & directed by Kim  Henkel co-writer & producer of the 1st film!! WHAT THE HECK  HAPPENED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",912988800,,963,4.810975609756097
