6683111,5,B00NWIFYWG,"This is the DVD Mads Mikkelsen  fans have waited patiently for - a Region 1 version for North America.  With Mads' greatly increased visibility and near universal praise for his portrayal of Hannibal Lecter in the NBC TV series (with a 3rd season coming - finally - next summer) , viewers can at last watch  all 32 episodes of Unit One at home. For many of us, this means getting to see Mikkelsen in an early incarnation -(the series ran on Danish TV from 2000-2004- and was the catalyst for his ""sexiest man in Denmark,"" title and European fame. )  He is by far the most charismatically watchable character in the series, which  follows an elite crime-fighting team that goes anywhere they're called  to track down Denmark's  worst murderers.
  One of the most interesting aspects of Unit One is its leader:  Chief Inspector Ingrid Dahl, who provides the through-line for the series.  Played engagingly by Charlotte Fich,, she constantly has to balance her demanding work schedule with her children, several would-be suitors (she's a widow) and the politics of the job.

Mads has a counterpart in Lars Brygmann's Thomas La Cour, his friend and partner, with an odd ability to sense what may have happened at a crime scene .  (This of course for Hannibal viewers instantly makes you think of Hugh Dancy's Will Graham and his intuitive grasp of murderers' minds.)  There are several other team members:played by distinctive Danish actors and a great many guest actors - among them, Mads' older brother Lars Mikkelsen, with an especially chilling portrait of a killer.
  An interesting aspect of the series is that it doesn't just give the younger cops a love interest (in Mads' case, several),. but the older folks get to have love scenes too.  All have problems, some resolved by the final segment,  others perhaps not.
This is a delightful early ""Nordic Noir"" series ,  worth getting to see a younger Mads Mikkelsen demonstrate why he has become an international movie star, with a rather fanatical fanbase.",1421625600,8,2008,4.870206489675517
6683112,4,B00NWIFYWG,"good series, haven't watched this one yet",1421107200,,41,5.0
6683113,5,B00NWIFYWG,I like this series. I have been impressed how good while different the Swedish police shows are.  It doesn't hurt to have Mads Mikkelsen in your series since he is delightful for many reasons.,1465257600,,192,4.647058823529412
6683114,3,B00NWIFYWG,"Not as good as Season One.  I think Johnny Olsen has had too many footballs hit to his head - he is not the sharpest knife in the drawer.  In episode 6, that swat team performed like a bunch of clowns.  I prefer the American swat teams where they take a head shot.",1463011200,,264,3.943396226415094
6683115,4,B00NWIFYWG,"Unit One is a little old-fashioned, in that the characters do not spend much time examining their ethical behavior. By that I mean that they seem a little one-dimensional and unconflicted ... and we all love complex, conflicted detectives, right? However, it's great to see Mats Mikkelsen in his younger days, and he does a lot of smiling (which he doesn't do any more). I watched both seasons and enjoyed it all. The perpetrator is usually easy to guess early in the episode, but it's how they get the evidence (or fail to get it) that makes the plot. Love having a female DI, wish she were a little older and wiser though.",1455667200,,624,4.530973451327434
6683116,5,B00NWIFYWG,One of the best series out there.,1454371200,,33,3.857142857142857
6683117,5,B00NWIFYWG,"Love this series! i am a native Dane who have been in the US for a long time, so when I discovered this series on PBS a couple of years ago, I decided that if I could ever buy it I would.  It is nice to be able to understand what the actors are saying in my original language, but also have the subtitles to rely on is very nice.  It is a series I would recommend to anyone who likes crime drama that is very well acted and suspenseful.  I give it two thumbs up!!!",1453939200,,464,3.8125
6683118,4,B00NWIFYWG,"Fun, Light Mystery...",1449100800,,21,6.333333333333333
6683119,5,B00NWIFYWG,Unit One is a well produced series with terrific actors and story lines. This is an older series and it would be nice to see a current day remake with guest appearances by the original actors. I am a fan of the European crime drama/mysteries especially from Sweden and Denmark. I highly recommend watching...you will not be disappointed.,1448755200,,337,4.827586206896552
6683120,3,B00NWIFYWG,Great acting but stories and season 2 not as good,1448496000,,49,4.0

6683122,5,B00NWIFYWG,Unit One Season Two - Carries forward with even better stories that keep your interest and touch on subjects American TV avoid or won't touch . The characters personal lives come unraveled but it doesn't keep them from solving the crimes.,1447286400,,238,4.829268292682927

6683124,5,B00NWIFYWG,One of the best shows!!!!  Maybe it is because I find these Danish productions so well done.  I don't feel I am watching some people just delivering lines.  They are not pretty girls or handsome men; they are actors that portray feelings.,1446681600,,238,4.619047619047619

6683128,5,B00NWIFYWG,"Loved Season 1, and likewise Season 2.  I will shortly invest in Season 3.  It has formulaic elements, but the truth-telling bits that explore human nature and failings with integrity are irresistible.  And it's not just the criminals that suffer investigation under the Nordic microscope - the Unit members also enjoy rich and productive scrutiny.  It delivers on many levels.",1440374400,,377,5.233333333333333

6683134,5,B00NWIFYWG,"I've become very fond of Scandinavian mysteries this one being at the top of the heap (after Wallander, of course).  There's depth to this one, the characters have depth, and the plots are excellent.  Most of all, I like them for their lack of car chases, crashes, and lack of blood letting.  Those two things pass for entertainment in the US, whereas in Europe the plots are more intelligent. This one is especially entertaining because the characters are played well and with a serial, one gets to know the characters well.  The Eagle is also one I like very much and recommend.",1438300800,2,580,4.6568627450980395
