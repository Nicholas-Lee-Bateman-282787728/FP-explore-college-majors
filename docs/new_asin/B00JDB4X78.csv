6355139,5,B00JDB4X78,A brilliant and special performance by Lea Thompson.,1425254400,2,52,5.625
6355140,5,B00JDB4X78,"This is an incredible independent film. Lea Thompson as always gives a superb performance. Instead of an over the top cliche movie, go for this!",1424995200,2,144,4.8
6355141,5,B00JDB4X78,"The Trouble With Truth is a delightful, romantic think piece on the swirling complexities of love, marriage, divorce, and parenting.  Like  My Dinner With Andre, the film is one long conversation, but in this case the subject matter is of much broader appeal. Lea Thompson and John Shea are superb as the  couple whose sexual chemistry and affection for each other has endured past the pain of their divorce. Jim Hemphill's script is both witty and poignant, full of hard truths, often painfully funny, as we recognize similar flaws and character traits within ourselves.  As  director he transcends the static nature of the piece with astute editing and unobtrusive camera movement, always focused on the ebb and flow of the relationship and the "" will they or won't they?"" issue which percolates beneath the surface. Lea Thompson is adorable as usual, but guys, don't think of this as a chick flick. It's really a couple's flick. Perhaps every romantic relationship would benefit from the conversation that follows seeing this excellent film.",1424908800,6,1044,5.081871345029239
6355142,1,B00JDB4X78,"Lea Thompson does a great job in this movie.  As it ended, I realized what a great actress she is.  But, I hated this movie.  It's quite depressing and enormously cynical about love and marriage.  It leaves you hanging with no resolution at the end.",1424476800,3,249,4.466666666666667
6355143,2,B00JDB4X78,Surprised this got some good reviews. I thought his acting left a bit to be desired and overall it was kind of boring. Ending wasn't really satisfying either...,1414540800,3,160,4.75
6355144,3,B00JDB4X78,"This DVD is about 96 minutes long and has scene selection. There are no subtitles which it could have desperately used. At very frequent points the actors talk so fast with a mumbling tone it is hard to understand what they are exactly saying.
There is a bonus feature of meeting the stars and directors commentary.

The movie basically is a conversation between a divorced couple after their daughter announces her engagement. Her father cannot understand why she would give up her freedom. One realizes that even though this was a contentious divorce that if this couple would have talked this much at one time and in such a civilized manner perhaps there would not have been a break up in the marriage.

The actors, John Shea and Lea Thompson do an outstanding job. Its a shame the sound quality or at least some subtitles were not up to their standard.",1409529600,2,856,4.662251655629139
6355145,5,B00JDB4X78,"This is an amazing film.  Lea Thompson gives one of her best performances.  The dialogue reveals rather than tells, and the progression of emotions and actions feels honest and real.  One of the best examples of independent cinema!",1407196800,3,231,5.026315789473684

6355148,5,B00JDB4X78,"Outstanding indie. Subtle, quiet and powerful. Reminiscent of the works of John Cassavetes. A small but big-hearted film. Charmingly mature  with smart, complicated, well-developed characters exploring the complexities of a long, fragmented relationship. Lea Thompson is fantastic and as beautiful as ever. It's a rare find, a film like this, a real gem. Director Jim Hemphill is a filmmaker to keep on eye on. Great for those who appreciate character dramas that dig deeper than your average fair. Check it out!

6355149,1,B00JDB4X78,Turned it off. Could not get interested.,1484438400,,40,4.857142857142857
6355150,5,B00JDB4X78,"I didn't know what to expect from this movie. Like most other people, I knew Lea Thompson from the '80s teen movies in which she starred. But the general concept of this film seemed intriguing and the description reminded me of a 1990s movie I really liked, ""What Happened Was..."" Not only did this movie exceed my expectations, but I actually prefer it to ""What Happened Was..."" which has always been a favorite.

I've wondered for a while exactly why this movie kept me so engrossed when I usually glance at the clock when I'm watching films with a lot less action. Very little happens here, after all. But thinking back, it occurred to me the secret as to why this movie works so well is given away in a small scene that occurs about halfway through: It's when the main characters think that someone might be eavesdropping on their conversation. Few of us can resist eavesdropping, even though we know it's not right to do. This movies plays like an hour and a half of a real conversation we get to overhear, and that's why it works so well.

Andy Warhol once observed that people will sit on their porch and observe passers by on their city street for hours, but if you take them to a movie, they'll say ""I'm bored."" This movie held my interest because it combines elements of why we like to people-watch with why we like to go to the movies.

Finally, Lea Thompson has grown into a seriously impressive actress and deserved the acclaim given to other actors of her generation with far less acting chops.",1483488000,,1508,4.516483516483516
6355151,4,B00JDB4X78,"Really enjoyed the movie - characters were three-dimensional and complex.  The situation seemed realistic.

6355182,4,B00JDB4X78,"I love Lea Thompson! This movie was a back and forth conversation between a  man and a woman who are divorced, about their lives when they were together and then apart, but I believe they really loved each other.

6355191,5,B00JDB4X78,"This is the second movie with only two characters for the majority of the movie I've watched in the last month.  The other one I fell asleep during.  The interaction between father and daughter at the beginning of the movie was just okay but once it moved to the interaction between the father and mother, long divorced, I found it fascinating on several levels.  For me, Lea Thompson and John Shea gave outstanding performances which were so good I felt like an eavesdropper on a very real, intense conversation.  I love the rare people and times you can have a conversation this deep with, so I'm sure that colors my view of this movie.  I enjoy Ironman to great comedies, etc., a pretty wide range of genres and found this a refreshing change from what I normally watch.  The script was engaging and unpredictable right up to the cliffhanger last words uttered.

If you want an ""action"" movie, this is not it.  If you want ""fluff,"" not it either.  This is a choice when you want to watch good acting of a good script that is ""real"" without being depressing or a bunch of screaming back and forth.

6355201,4,B00JDB4X78,"The key to creating a film set in a single night with just two characters is that the script has to be extra sharp to keep your attention. Kudos to Jim Hemphill as 'The Trouble With The Truth' certainly accomplished that. The dialog feels very effortless and natural, and I found the conversations engaging. The story gets even better as the film progressed and never overstayed its welcome. It certainly doesn't hurt that they've got two delightful leads (Lea Thompson and John Shea) in a role that utilized their talents and charisma. The two have a wonderful chemistry which help bring the story to life.",1476662400,2,607,4.79047619047619
6355202,5,B00JDB4X78,"This is a powerful, visceral, weighty, yet easy-on-the-ear (as in no shouting) conversation that couples would be so lucky to have before or during their marriage, but often never have. And yet because it occurs long after the breakup, and both are obviously still into and turned on by each other, it has an added seductive, anticipatory element that helps hold the interest. So this film, in which all of that occurs, is masterful because it is just that-- a long, straight-from-the-hip, compelling exchange between 2 people. Part of its uniqueness is that judgement is suspended. This is not a morality play, at least not on its face. One might extrapolate that knowing who the person really is in advance of a relationship, or where the problems lie during, could go far to prevent or improve.  But truth can, of course, be a scary troubling business. The writing and directing by Jim Hemphill are smart and exciting and the 2 leads:  Lea Thompson (Emily) and John Shea (Robert) give outstanding and fully credible performances.  The dialogue offers a successful mix of a somewhat cerebral interpretive discussion of love, punctuated with literary references, and the right-from-the-gut, unadulterated nitty gritty, sometimes surprisingly personal, talk.  I think it's an exceptional film,  the story well written and told. So no trouble with the truth from this camp.  Highly recommend.",1476576000,3,1391,5.16

6355214,5,B00JDB4X78,"In my opinion, one of the riskiest of film experiments is to focus an entire film on a group of people or in this case, two people, and consist of just their conversation in one locale. So many things have to be right for that kind of film to succeed ... the actors have to be perfect, the writing has to be sharp, and if you're going to tell a story about a divorced couple talking about what went wrong in their marriage, then you better have two actors with chemistry. John Shea and Lea Thompson absolutely have it in Jim Hemphill's beautiful little independent film. The film starts out when Robert (Shea) finds out that his daughter is engaged. That prompts a return from his ex-wife Emily (Thompson). They meet up at a restaurant to first talk about their daughter's impending marriage, and that unleashes the emotions of their failed marriage, and the film is nothing more than their conversation in the restaurant that ranges from comical to seriously dramatic in a perfect blend of honesty revealed. Both actors are truly wonderful and have SUCH an amazing chemistry, you truly believe these two people are completely connected to one another, in ways that are even stronger than the bonds of marriage or the winds of divorce. And it's fascinating to watch the refreshing feeling two people have when they can actually be totally 100% honest with another person they have known so intimately. And in an age where riveting action seems to only come from mindless robot movies, there is nothing more riveting than watching what two people who are clearly meant for each other are going to do when they also realize that somehow they just can't work right together as a couple. I love the honest complications of love and marriage on display throughout this film. And in a rare genre of conversation type films that include the landmark film ""My Dinner with Andre"", it stands as a resounding success. John Shea is so magnifying to watch on screen, you get such a great sense of the complexity of this man, and Lea Thompson, still just as beautiful as when so many of us fell in love with her in the 1980's, is remarkably brash and vulnerable as she tries to admit truths to her ex-husband that she has discovered over the years.",1442880000,7,2234,4.643939393939394
6355215,2,B00JDB4X78,"I am Lea Thompson fan, but this film is very disappointing - after 20 minutes it is clear where this is heading, after 40 it becomes boring and after an hour you don't really care about the story... this production would be fine as theater production, but 90 minutes of non-stop dialogue without a single piece of music in the background and the story far too simple even for 15 or 20 minutes short story is huge disappointment

Lea Thompson and John Shea played well, but the script and directing were simply poor - it looks like a production of someone who doesn't watch much movies himself or just don't like movies",1432512000,4,618,4.517857142857143

With the exception of the first couple of scenes the entire movie is based on the interactions and chemistry between the two main characters. Thankfully the actors and the writing are up to the task. It is rare to see such a nuanced, clear eyed and honest perspective on aging and regret.

If you are put off at the beginning by the arrogant, seemingly narcissistic male protagonist I urge you to stick with it. The humanity begins to shine through once the guards begin to be let down.  John Shea and Lea Thompson are fantastic and deserve recognition for what they accomplished with this. Seriously...give it a chance.",1520726400,3,750,4.8062015503875966

I loved seeing so much chemistry between older characters (late 40s/early 50s) and the all the wild turns the evening took. The ending was rough but believable. Lea Thompson is still a beauty, and super talented. I'd watch it again.",1501200000,2,326,4.637931034482759
8649846,5,B00JDB4X78,"I loved this movie.  I really enjoyed watching them discuss their relationships, life experience and choices.  There were a lot of profound one-liners and poignant life-vistas.  It's like a David Mamet play or reminiscent of ""Dinner with Andre"" without the pretentiousness and repetition, beating you over the head with entirely predictable dynamic arc and recapitulation of the message. I really enjoyed this movie and thought the actors did a fantastic job living the experience of the dialog without giving away their knowledge of the script that was yet to be revealed.",1486684800,2,573,5.274725274725275
