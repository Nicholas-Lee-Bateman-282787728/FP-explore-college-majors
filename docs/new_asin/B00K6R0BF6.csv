6403897,5,B00K6R0BF6,My parents love this series and I had searched all over to find the DVD of the second series for them which would play on U.K. Machine. Excellent quality and arrive within timescales quoted. Thanks Amazon,1399161600,,204,4.694444444444445
6403898,5,B00K6R0BF6,This was a great show back from the early 90's.  Too bad they cancelled it after 3 seasons.,1492473600,,91,4.055555555555555
6403899,5,B00K6R0BF6,LOVE IT,1492473600,,7,3.0
6403900,3,B00K6R0BF6,Too bad not all episodes included.,1492214400,,34,4.833333333333333
6403901,5,B00K6R0BF6,"Though the show is brilliant, the DVDs are lacking, And episode ""The Littlest Cowboy"" (S2 E6) is missing! There are no chapter marks, so you must rewind or FF if you want a specific scene.",1492128000,2,188,4.4
6403902,2,B00K6R0BF6,It does not have all the episodes .,1487980800,,35,3.5
6403903,5,B00K6R0BF6,I watched this  series  when it first came out.  I love it  i GOT EVREY SEASON,1486425600,,78,3.6875
6403904,2,B00K6R0BF6,"The Young Riders Second Season is missing six episodes: ""The Play 'N Tha' Thing"", ""Bad Company"", ""Blood Money"", ""The Littlest Cowboy"", ""Dead Ringer"", and ""Born to Hang"".",1484265600,,169,5.296296296296297
6403905,5,B00K6R0BF6,"It is not a complete season. However, that is mentioned in the product information before you even buy it. So that is not a major issue. I purchased this DVD as a gift for someone and they loved it! It brought much joy watching it over and over. This series deals with issues that are prevalent today like racism, gender inequality, etc  BUT it is not gruesome or hardcore. It is appropiate for all ages which is a plus because it is hard sometimes to find a show thatbeveryone enjoys. It is funny and well written even the casual western lover will enjoy it. In fact I wish they had done more then three seasons of this show. I would highly recommend this to anyone.",1480636800,4,667,4.336
6403906,5,B00K6R0BF6,"even that it's missing 4 episodes and I don't understand why, would be nice to know",1480636800,,83,4.25
6403907,4,B00K6R0BF6,Missing two of the episodes. The ones inwhich Noah joins. My fault I should have completely read the description.  But other wise good.,1479600000,,135,4.869565217391305

6403909,1,B00K6R0BF6,"Do not buy from this person. The DVD cover looks like they printed it themselves. The cover is very fuzzy. Also, the episodes are out of order on the disc, and missing 4 episodes. I'm guessing they printed those as well.",1476144000,,220,4.390243902439025

6403912,5,B00K6R0BF6,This is a great show to watch. We also enjoyed season 1 and will soon be ordering season 3. Wish they had made more!,1474675200,,116,3.875

6403917,5,B00K6R0BF6,awsome,1467158400,,6,6.0
6403918,1,B00K6R0BF6,love the show but was disappointed in dvds. missing episodes and the list of episodes on the back did not match the one that were on the disks,1466208000,,142,4.107142857142857
6403919,3,B00K6R0BF6,Would have been 4 stars if it wasn't missing some of the best episodes of this season.,1461801600,,86,4.117647058823529
6403920,5,B00K6R0BF6,"Fabulous series again, we wish there was more of the series",1458000000,,59,4.454545454545454
6403921,4,B00K6R0BF6,ok,1456185600,,2,2.0
6403922,3,B00K6R0BF6,"OK. This set is decent quality. The menus look cheap, but the colors in the episodes actually look nicer than the MGM release of the first season. The real annoying thing is the missing episodes. ""Dead Ringer"" and ""The Play's the Thing"" are listed on the case, but not present on the discs. This throws off the labeling for the entire set of discs as some episodes are now present on different discs than what the package says. Those two missing episodes are supposedly actually present on the box set version. Either way, there's still four other missing episodes, which really hurts this set. The copyrighted music in some of the episodes, especially ""Born to Hang"" and ""The Littlest Cowboy"", could have easily been replaced. It would have been a little trickier with ""Bad Company"", but at least we would have had a more complete set.

The misleading labeling is unforgivable....",1456185600,8,881,4.8344370860927155
6403923,5,B00K6R0BF6,Great show!,1451260800,,11,5.0
6403924,2,B00K6R0BF6,If you would just add a disc with the missing episodes then you would not have a clearance issue.,1449187200,,97,4.157894736842105
6403925,5,B00K6R0BF6,This is one of my fav. shows to watch and share with friends and family,1448409600,,71,3.8
6403926,3,B00K6R0BF6,"I got this from Walmart If you want the complete version this isn't it, its missing at least the first episode, not happy about that.",1438992000,,133,4.36
6403927,1,B00K6R0BF6,Buyer beware.  Many episodes are missing from the disks that I got.  The package doesn't match the content.  Meaning that episodes that are on the case are not on the disks.  It is quite incomplete.  I'd give it less than one star if that was an option.,1438560000,6,253,4.297872340425532
6403928,5,B00K6R0BF6,satisfied with purchase,1438214400,,23,7.0
6403929,3,B00K6R0BF6,"A viewer can definitely tell that this was copied from another source and it wasn't done much better than I could have done myself. However, there are episodes here that I did not previously have and only 2 that I did have on VHS that I had to copy myself. Overall, it is worth the low price paid.",1434931200,,297,4.137931034482759
6403930,3,B00K6R0BF6,"I am pleased with the ordered DVD of Young Riders I live in Germany and I am a big fan of the series. What do I not at all well find that episodes are listed on the DVD but these are not on the DVD. I am very disappointed. Unfortunately, the return of the DVD from Germany very awkward. I think that's not very customer friendly.

6403931,1,B00K6R0BF6,"Check out the gift box edition, it has two more episodes than this edition - Dead Ringer and The Play's The Thing, but still missing the other four.",1433808000,,148,4.321428571428571
6403932,3,B00K6R0BF6,This season did not include all the episodes that were shown on television.  There were approximently 7 or 8 shows skipped.,1429660800,,123,4.857142857142857
6403933,2,B00K6R0BF6,I say this only because of the missing 4 episodes and I really enjoyed the show but I wish it would have been the complete series. Please let me know when the complete season 2 is out,1428192000,5,183,3.972972972972973
6403934,2,B00K6R0BF6,"Damn. Wish I'd read the reviews before purchasing. There is actually 6 episodes missing. The first - Born to Hang, 3 - Dead Ringer, 6 - The Littlest Cowboy, 7 - Blood Money, 9 - Bad Company, 11 - The Play's the Thing. Yes, big fan. Not only that, but the discs don't match the playback of what's on the back cover. They're all out of order. The first episode to come up on disc 1 is Star Light, Star Bright (Episode 10). Seriously! Is this really a legit copy? I find it hard to believe that the studio would stuff up that badly!",1427328000,6,529,4.096153846153846
6403935,3,B00K6R0BF6,Got season 2 with the impression that this would be the complete season.  Unfortunately it was not.  How can you issue a season AND NOT EVEN INCLUDE the very first episode? Kinda stupid. Wondering if there will ever be a complete season 2 release since there has not been an issue with releasing the COMPLETE 1ST AND 3RD SEASONS.  Young Rider fans would all like to have the COMPLETE SERIES - not the series minus 4-5 episodes.  Otherwise am well pleased with the season.  I remember watching the show faithfully every week.  It is good family entertainment the way it should be.,1421107200,15,579,4.627450980392157
6403936,1,B00K6R0BF6,I need to return this dvd set as it is not the complete second season. It is actually missing 5 episodes including the first episode.,1418601600,9,133,4.36
6403937,4,B00K6R0BF6,"We had season 1 and 3 but not 2 so I bought Season 2 to complete the set.  We do not like the language of swearing, but that was what the TV series was although I don't remember that much swearing as on these DVD's.  The series was good if a person likes westerns (which we do)..  The TV series was several years ago, but we remembered it was about orphan boys who were hired to be Pony Express Riders before the Civil War.  So it was good to see the entire series all at once.",1402790400,,477,3.9375
8656395,3,B00K6R0BF6,Same as the 1st Season -  should have been noted it was not the complete season,1525737600,,79,3.9375
8656396,1,B00K6R0BF6,I just attempted watching disc one.  Neither it nor any of the other discs in this package would work.  All were faulty.,1525564800,,120,4.409090909090909

8656400,1,B00K6R0BF6,"Boy, do I regret not reading the reviews first. Missing key episodes, what are on the dvds are out of order, and the picture quality sucks. Looks like it was transferred off of an old VHS. Lesson learned. Read reviews first.",1520035200,,224,4.487804878048781
8656401,5,B00K6R0BF6,Item just as described!  Great price for a great item.,1519862400,,54,4.4

I know because I can't play them in Europe!
Thanks guys!!",1508803200,,123,4.391304347826087
8656403,5,B00K6R0BF6,Just a fun western with a good bit of action..,1506470400,,46,3.7
8656404,4,B00K6R0BF6,Missing 4 episodes but the description told me that. It seems that no one offers a complete second season dvd.,1503014400,,110,4.55
