These were for a gift and I wish I wouldn't have spent that kind of money on them and bought something different. But I couldn't find them anywhere so once I saw them, I ordered them.",1331596800,,253,4.183673469387755
8179461,5,B000NNTED8,"I think these 3 films are very overlooked. I,much like everyone was shocked by the ending of the first one...lets face it,no one saw that coming!!!Parts 2 & 3 were just as great. They keep up the back story of the original,yet it's not afraid to make fun of it's self and has all the horror elements it needed to be called a ""SLASHER FILM"".I feel each film could carry it's own. I thought Pamela Springsteen did an amazing job as the sweet,yet completely psychotic ""Angel Of Death"" Angela Baker!

I for one would vote these films as some of the top slasher films of the 80's.",1268784000,,575,4.373831775700935
8179462,5,B000NNTED8,"We use to sit around with our kids and watch this when it first came out!  We bought this as a christmas present for our daughter who loved watching them with us!  She loved it, it reminded her of her childhood!",1265414400,,211,4.121951219512195
8179463,5,B000NNTED8,"I rented this movies during the 80's and then I rented them several times, as I like them pretty much.
Some decades later, it was hard to find this Sleepaway Camp Trilogy in The Netherlands, that's why I order it from Amazon.com. Easy to order, easy to pay and fast delivery! The movies don't have any (Dutch) subtitles, but that's not a very big problem.",1257292800,2,355,4.476923076923077
8179464,5,B000NNTED8,"Sleepaway camp is a good crazy movie, I had my neighbor watch this movie and she was hooked.  I wonder if they will make more like this, i cant wait to buy these movies.",1253836800,,169,3.9705882352941178
8179465,5,B000NNTED8,"The Sleepaway Camp series changed the slasher genre for good. Out of all the great slasher flicks that were produced in the 80's this series really holds up, Even compared to today's slasher movies. Pamela Springsteen did a amazing job as Angela in Sleepaway camp 2 and 3 and the first one had very cool and shocking ending to a horror movie that no other movie still to this day can't beat it. If you are a cult horror fan, this set is definitely worth adding to your DVD collection.",1232841600,3,484,4.388888888888889
