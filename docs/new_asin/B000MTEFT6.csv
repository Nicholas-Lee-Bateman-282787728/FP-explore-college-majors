2747438,3,B000MTEFT6,"I adore Betty White, her role in this movie wasn't big as they lead you to believe based on the DVD cover. The movie itself was ok. The lead character reminded me of Julia Roberts.",1327276800,2,180,4.171428571428572
2747439,1,B000MTEFT6,Even the great Betty White could not salvage this atrocious excuse for a movie. So horrible I couldn't finish watching. The lead actor's performance was almost as bad as the production quality and writing.,1297814400,3,205,5.0588235294117645
2747440,2,B000MTEFT6,"ok why the big picture of betty whitethey want us to have the indication that she has abig role in this movie
thats not the case",1290816000,2,128,3.9615384615384617
2747441,1,B000MTEFT6,"If you enjoy terrible acting, ridiculous plots, and horrid scripts, then this is the movie for you. If your looking for a good romantic comedy this is not it. Please don't waste your money like I did. Thank goodness it was so cheap or I would really feel terrible about purchasing it.",1242691200,3,284,4.480769230769231
2747442,5,B000MTEFT6,"This is NOT a formulaic romantic comedy. Although supposedly modelled on Dicken's Great Expectations it really owes more to his friend Hans Christian Anderson.  It is a great story with a moral- the need to overcome the shackles that we place on ourselves through disappointment, resentment and fear in order to love.",1226620800,3,317,5.096153846153846
2747443,4,B000MTEFT6,I Believe it was such a great movie. I think it can be a little cheesy but in a good way. Also it has a story line that any girl and probably every girl can relate to. I also believe that this movie helps everyone who watches it remember why we started to believe in fairytales when we were young and question how come we ever stopped?,1217203200,8,335,4.014925373134329
2747464,2,B000MTEFT6,The only reason I can think of that they made such a cheesy knock-off of a Julia Roberts/Hugh Grant kind of film is for the PG rating.  I guess kids might like it.  Very awful script and acting.  Some lovely SF scenes.,1408752000,,218,4.142857142857143

2747466,1,B000MTEFT6,"Lead actress tries so hard to be Julia Roberts,  but is so unbelievable.  I'm really curious how this awful movie got funded.  The plot line is so predictable... it's the kind of story a 13 year girl would write.  Such a waste of time....I guess Netflix just needed to fill up its ""romantic comedy"" genre library.",1405728000,,313,4.535714285714286

2747468,5,B000MTEFT6,Good clean movies are getting more and more difficult to find. This one was fun and sweet and worth the money.,1363737600,,110,4.285714285714286

2747470,2,B000MTEFT6,"I trashed this from my movie library, it was that boring.  If you check other reviews, you'll see they also have the same rating.",1359504000,2,129,4.375
2747471,1,B000MTEFT6,"This movie was absolutely horrible. It seemed like the main character memorized Runaway Bride verbatim. Even her name is the same, Maggie/Mags. Julia Roberts must be her favorite actress or something. She kept using lines from her movies, she tried to part her hair like Roberts', she even got a lip injection to try to have big lips like Julia Roberts. She showed no emotion. She didn't get mad at all ever, she always had a smile on her face, even when the scene called for her to be pissed. When the girls broke into her apartment she didn't get upset, not even a little, even if they were her friends. It just didn't seem real. Every bit of it you could tell was staged and ""scripted"", if you can even call it a script. Even Betty White and James Avery couldn't add even an ounce of depth to this movie. A movie is supposed to keep you in your seat anticipating what will happen next. This movie just makes you wonder how much more can you take. I think this was worse than sitting through the Sugar Bowl, which I turned this on to try to get some relief from watching that game.",1357084800,6,1083,4.313725490196078
2747472,5,B000MTEFT6,"Betty White has only a small part but it helps to put humor in the show ""THIRD WISH"".  The show is about a girl who does not let life make her sad but keep on smiling.  She keeps a positive outlook and treats people WITH respect no matter who they are.  She shows that in spite of bad luck sometimes you can still find happiness just don't give up.",1353283200,,348,4.0144927536231885
2747473,3,B000MTEFT6,"I found this film to be a bit of a disappointment. I like the male lead and the bits with Betty White, but I think the character of the female lead could have definitely been tweaked ""a bit.""",1345939200,2,191,4.052631578947368

8171927,4,B000MTEFT6,My husband and I enjoyed this movie - he normally goes for sci-fi and action so I was surprised when he said he really enjoyed the chick flick.  Not everybody's taste probably but if you want a nice clean romance then this is worth watching.  Yes the lead was not top notch but I have seen far worse.,1435363200,,300,4.155172413793103
8171928,5,B000MTEFT6,I loved this movie because it was so encouraging to let me know God cares and will do the impossible. ..I am a Joseph.  A dreamer,1430524800,,129,3.9615384615384617
8171929,5,B000MTEFT6,Fun Film,1427932800,,8,3.5
8171930,2,B000MTEFT6,"Not all Low-budget films are poor quality, but this one IS.

The fact that this film was rated PG on Netflix and the opening lines were about a half dozen exclamations of ""sh*t"", made me flinch!  (My children were in the room.) Aside from the poor plot, acting, etc., there some annoying inaccuracies.  For example, when Maggie is on the phone with her BFF and said something about 1687 and Jane Austen. (Jane Austin was born in 1775 and wrote her books in the 1800s.)  The lead Jenna Mattison was no match for Betty White, James Avery (Uncle Phil from Fresh Prince), Mindy Cohn, and Sean Maguire (Robin Hood from Once Upon a Time). The highs and lows are very extreme also; smiles and upbeat talk in one scene then sadness and somber music in the next.  The restaurant scene was just painful...tucking her napkin in the dress neckline, handing back silverware to the wine steward.  My last complaint is the soundtrack; it was horrid. Tchaicovsky probably rolled over in his grave!

This is crappy cinema, but if you're stuck inside with nothing better to do or watch...",1426291200,,1070,4.659574468085107
8171931,1,B000MTEFT6,"Worst movie I've seen in a long time. So glad I didn't pay to watch it or I would have been very put out. It's rated PG but the first 20 seconds of the film, the lead actress must have said s*** at least 30 times. I tried so hard to like this movie, because it was a lazy Saturday and we were having a chick flick day - but this was just plain bad. It's like she's trying to be a mash-up Julia Roberts a la Pretty Girl and Rene Russo. Her face and lips look terribly done, like she's a lot older than she's trying to appear. There's zero chemistry between her and the lead actor. I felt sorry for him. Armand Assante looks like a mafia kingpin. I kept waiting for Joe Pesci to walk into the scene and the two of them start shooting. It was just horrible. Avoid this movie. Run. Be afraid. Be very afraid.",1408924800,,804,4.0
