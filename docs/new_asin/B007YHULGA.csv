5114859,3,B007YHULGA,"I reviewed this film for a community documentary series.  While I agree 100% with what is said, most of the people interviewed are Democrats and not sure how it would play for moderate Republicans (yes there are a few).  Raises very good points, issues, etc.  But it us 60 minute film full of meat and 15 minutes worth of hype.  Watch it; not as good as Priceless and XRegeneration.",1343088000,5,382,4.492753623188406

5114866,4,B007YHULGA,"This is a great movie about how corporate america and the need to remain in office dictates our policy. It discusses how there is a lack of compromise, in part due to the lack of social interaction between the politicians, and in part from their needing to cater to donors to win the next election. The billions of dollars that are spent each year on campaigns could easily go to much needed jobs, education, health care and infrastructure. It points out that even those who run for office because they truly want to help, are often not given that opportunity once in office. Great movie. You need to be able to separate fact from opinion in ANY documenatry though, because just like all media today.. every movie or newscast has an agenda.",1430611200,,740,4.613636363636363
5114867,5,B007YHULGA,"I think this film has a clear bias against liberals... no not really, I just thought it would be fun to write that after reading some of the critical reviews on here. I think its ironic that after watching a movie whose only purpose is to expose the harm of polarizing politics, all the negative comments are people crying foul because team conservative could have been portrayed better in this movie. You're kinda missing the point. If it helps inoculate just one conservative from the infectious bias of this ""liberal"" film, I will try and provide an olive branch:

Almost all high level Democratic politicians have sacrificed their morals to get where they are. Their legislation violates the Constitution, they take legal bribes from organizations who are harming the public interest, and they rarely tell the truth. They are more interested in their own careers then the best interests of the public. They make up stuff to portray their political rivals as worse than they are. And Democrats kick puppies.

All that is true... except maybe the puppy thing but who knows. Yes, Democratic politicians suck... but don't most Republican politicians fit the same description? Why take such strong positions on one team or the other when they both suck? I think agreeing on this point would bring us one step closer to a productive and positive discussion.",1425081600,4,1355,4.93859649122807

5114873,2,B007YHULGA,"For example, the current polarization in America began with Barry Goldwater and Newt Gingrich.  Highlights the far right tea party as a problem but doesn't mention far left.  Plenty of other examples of selective reporting makes it impossible to trust any of its assertions.",1393804800,4,274,5.204545454545454
5114874,1,B007YHULGA,"I enjoy their message: that partisanship isn't benefiting us. I disagree with their methods. The first thing they did was explain that watching political commentary (they use Sean Hannity and Kieth Olbermann as examples) is dividing the nation; creating ""hyper partisans."" They accuse such commentators of ""fear mongering"" and ""using fear to create division."" I wish I could make this stuff up, but they follow that segment with the inevitable doom and destruction that awaits us all if we don't do as they say. They then pontificate at length on the current political climate (apparently their political commentary isn't to be feared). Their discussion of Citizens United should make anyone familiar with the decision cringe. Their analysis and conclusions are nothing short of outright distortions. After discussing how ""labels"" are the problem they discuss how the ""far right"" and the ""far left"" (both labels) are the real problem. They present this ""center"" that can and will solve all problems. Of course, nowhere is a rule that the ""center"" has the answers. Nor is it decreed that ""compromise"" will land us exactly where we need to be. Opposed to their lengthy discussion of the ill's of money in politics, it would have been nice for them to discuss WHY there is so much money in politics: it pays! Their solutions are nothing more than bandaids.",1373673600,6,1353,5.044642857142857
5114875,4,B007YHULGA,"I agreed with Bob Schieffer's comment about never seeing such polarization within the Congress; I've been following politics for over 40 years, and I can't remember when it's been this bad before. The film seems to be a little more biased against Republicans/""The Right"", but I think that's because the far right has a little higher profile than the far left. One of the best parts of the film was how they explained the difference between real news programs, and commentary or ""entertainment"". That's a big one, since many people are getting their information from ""entertainment"" sources. A second point is the money in politics, which I think most would agree contaminates the process. Politicians on bothe sides seem to be more interested in pleasing their benefactors than the people the represent. No matter where your politics lie, you should take a look at his documentary.",1371427200,9,881,5.041095890410959
5114876,2,B007YHULGA,"The presentation is highly partisan, portraying those on the left as the non-partisans who are willing to compromise and look at all sides of the issue, while the republicans are all extreme ideologues that refuse to budge. For example, when the narrator was talking about divisive partisanship, three different republican congress people were shown in the background, when the narrator switched to the ideals of partisanship three different democratic congress people where shown, ironically the one they focused on the longest has the most partisan left-wing voting record in congress.

Another example is when using sound bites, Democratic congress people were shown talking about compromise and trying to work while virtually all of the sound bites of Republicans saying they won't budge. The arrant partisanship of the film in the first 15 minutes was so palpable that it began to distract from the very real problem they wanted to address.

But it only get's worse the film claims (falsely) that partisanship came from ""Republican"" Barry Goldwater and then it manifested itself even greater by ""Republican"" (you could really just fill in any name you wish). Basically partisanship according to the film only came about and is only here because of ""Republicans"", of course the voting records says the EXACT opposite. For example:

The four congress's under Bush voted this way

90% of Democratic votes went strictly by party line
88% of Republican votes went strictly by party line

Democrat's were more likely to vote party line under Bush than Republicans.

The firest two congress under Obama voted this way

94% of Democratic votes went strictly by party line
86% of Republican votes went strictly by party line

The Democrats became MORE partisan under Obama while the Republicans became LESS Partisan.

But you would NEVER know the FACTS from this film.

The These are some of the MAJOR FALSEHOODS promoted by the film -

* America had a surplus in 2001 - NOT according to the CBO and the Treasury department. (craigsteiner.us/articles/16)

* President Bush launched a war on Iraq - Only congress can authorize us to go to war.

* Credit Default Swaps were called ""underhanded loan""  - CDS's were derivatives which had ALL of the loans in most of the world packaged into. The so-called predatory loans were actually less than .001% of all loans, AND that's the high estimate.

* Claims that predatory loans caused the housing market to collapse - purely laughable, they were such a minor part of the loans that I haven't heard a single source make this claim because it is so glaringly wrong.

* Claims that America banking almost collapsed from funding predatory loans - Again absolutely laughable, Bank of America has more cash on hand than the total amount of all predatory loans. Instead the financial collapse had to do with a collapse in the derivative trading markets.

* Claims that Barrack Obama's stimulus package cost 787 billion dollars - WHOOPS missed the number by 1 trillion. Even Liberal Ezra Klein begrudgingly admitted that the stimulus package cost over 1.7 Trillion dollars.

* Claims the housing market collapse started in mid 2004 - ""Housing prices peaked in early 2006, started to decline in 2006 and 2007, and reached new lows in 2012"" Wikipedia

* Claims that most money is borrowed from China - FALSE ""China owns about 8 percent of publicly held U.S. debt."" (usgovinfo.about.com/od/moneymatters/ss/How-Much-US-Debt-Does-China-Own)

* A commentator on the program claimed that Sean Hannity was not being truthful when he said that the 112th congress (the one that the republicans regained the House and the Democrats retained the senate) was split between the two parties.  Ummmmmmmmmmm sorry Mr. commentator but that's EXACTLY what happened and that isn't even a partisan point or opinion, it's just a FACT.

* Confuses tea party with conservatism - the tea party is more libertarian than conservative.

* Claims citizens united gave corporations the same rights as people - that's false citizens united, which is terrible, was about free speech.

* After trying to scare the viewers about Citizen United it forgot to mention that corporate spending on campaigns was less than 1% of total spending. It also forgot to mention that political foundation spend upwards of 3 trillion a year with no rules and that unions are the second biggest spenders on political campaigns. In Fact if you lump all corporations together they are #34 on the list that totals just 45 different groups that spend money on campaigns. But you would never know this after watching this DVD, instead you would think they were #1.

* The film completely misrepresents the debt ceiling debacle claiming that Obama was trying to compromise. Bob Woodward who was there and reporting on it from behind close doors says the exact opposite. The President actually created confusion, pissed off both right and left, held secret meetings and announced plans that went against the deals that had been made by both sides. Basically the president  undermined the congress and as many insiders have noted came off as an inexperienced but arrogant meddler.

* They claimed that S&P downgrade was because of a dysfunctional congress - while that was mentioned as a small contributing factor the file completely ignored the main reason that S&P said, and that was because of the burgeoning debt and weather we could pay it back or not.

Good points it tried to make but failed

Echo chamber groups - It never explored that fact that studies show those on the left tend to stay much more inside their echo chambers and are much less likely to get any opinion outside of their far left sites than those on the far right, but that doesn't go with their presentation of the left as being the sensible, non-partisan ones.

It talked about the news media but never once mentioned peer-reviewed scientific studies that show that the vast majority of it leans to the left and these scientists estimate that it gives the left a 4-8% point advantage and just how hard it is to find truly right-wing news sources.

It said that people get confused over commentary programs and real news shows but it never showed the polls done by TIME (and other sources) that people on the left pick Comedian Jon Stewart as their favorite ""journalist"" while people on the right picked ""Anderson Cooper"". I agree that people are confused but in a UCLA poll 4% of conservatives claimed that Sean Hannity and Bill O'Rielly were news journalists  while 66% of liberals identified Rachel Maddow and Chris Matthews as journalists. So there is confusion but it appears to mostly be on the left.

Money controls politics - That's true, but rather than show the millions of dollars of special interest money it focus on the left's monster under the bed citizens united. As we know corproate giving pales in comparison to PAC's, foundations, unions, etc etc.

Bottom Line:

It spends almost 1 hour putting down the right while propping up the left, it seriously misleads, distorts and denies reality but in the end the suggestions it gives are pretty good. It get's five stars for the last 10 minutes of suggestions and loses 3 stars for the first hour.",1368403200,12,7212,4.966749792186201

5114879,2,B007YHULGA,"In 1989, O.J. Simpson pleaded no contest to a charge of beating his wife.  In a radio interview the ex-football star would rationalize his violent behavior toward her by saying, ""We were both wrong.""

The political documentary PATRIOCRACY seems to want to excuse away the one percent's continued assault on the 99 percent with the phony if widespread premise of the far right and far left failing to meet in the middle to solve America's troubles.  As Jim Hightower puts it, policymaking is about up-down, not right-left, the wealthy's attempt to continue stealing from and dominating the masses being the real problem of America, and the world.  Yet PATRIOCRACY pulls an O.J., redefining reality in order to make the victim as much to blame as the perpetrator.  Thus, we see interviews with too many political hacks (Alan Simpson) and discredited think tank pundits (Pat Buchanan) but too few with citizen activism leaders.  PATRIOCRACY feeds us false equivalent after false equivalent, likening M.S.N.B.C. host Ed Schultz to FOX NEWS CHANNEL's Bill O'Reilly as if their opposite political views mean they both lie as often.  By this logic, the extreme takes on the environment of 350.org and the gas & oil industry means neither is to be trusted.  Or because Wall Street and the Americans who lost their homes to the mortgage scandals see things so differently, both sides are wrong.

Then there's the purported polarization in Congress, PATRIOCRACY making it sound as if Republicans and Democrats both refuse to budge.  Look up how many Democrats voted with George W. Bush and the Republicans, then look up and how many Republicans voted with Barack Obama and the Democrats.

Notice that the tragedy of the Gabriella Giffords shooting PATRIOCRACY reports is the result of divisive scare talk by one pro-one percent talk shows.  No acts of violence have been inspired by people's radio and television hosts such as Thom Hartmann and Randi Rhodes, not that PATRIOCRACY even mentions them.

The film further discredits its premise, recounting Tea Party kooks crashing town hall meetings in the summer of 2010.  There are no such dupes on the 99 percent's side of the argument.

Nonetheless, PATRIOCRACY wraps up with a few good ideas to solve the problems it has so poorly defined, addressing the need for campaign finance reform and even recommending the citizens' group Common Cause.",1351382400,7,2385,5.063938618925831
