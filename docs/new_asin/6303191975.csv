615049,5,6303191975,"3 NINJAS
KICK BACK

I am a big fan of the ""3 Ninjas"" movies and have been since they were first released, well at least the first three. The first film is without a doubt a classic kid's film. Now while the ones that followed were not as great as the original they were still very entertaining. I recently started showing them to my little cuz trying to pass that on to her. She has thus far loved them and thought they were all funny. I agree with her on that part especially the first one.

But we are here to talk about the second film in the series [although third shot] which is ""3 Ninjas: Kick Back"". This film follows the boys as they have to give up their championship baseball game to travel to Japan to help their grandfather. He was going to a small town in Japan to present an ancient dagger to the winner of a martial arts tournament. But once there he is put in the hospital after a car accident caused by men looking to steal the dagger. The ninjas come to help out and even bring the dagger has grandpa had left it behind grabbing the wrong bag.

Now this film is just pure fun and I am happy that all that fondness I had for these films still is in me. Sure as I am older now it doesn't hold that same exact kinda magic but I still love it. The comedy is great here as it is mostly slapstick and action oriented. That is the main reason my cuz loved because of the slapstick humor in the fighting. The action is great for this type of film and keeps the film moving, these kids are good. I wish that a commentary would have been made for the DVD with the three ninjas [only one here {Colt} was in the first three]. Even now as adults it would be cool to hear them talking about it.

I do recommend this movie to all that love that nostalgic feeling we all get from time to time. Also to anyone that wants a fun flick for their kids to enjoy. Sure it isn't the best movie ever made but it is a good one. just shut that brain off and enjoy the nostalgia with Rocky, Colt and Tum Tum. I had a great time going back and I am sure you will to. There was also a video game for this film made on SNES and Sega platforms but that is a review for another day. Also it didn't bother me that Grandpa's last name was changed in this film.",1410825600,,2243,4.022421524663677
615050,4,6303191975,This one was a cute follow up to the first.  DIs-appointed in the Rocky re-cast but still cute for the young kids out there.,1409616000,,124,4.166666666666667
615100,5,6303191975,good movie,1408492800,,10,4.5
615101,5,6303191975,"Pros: Finally you can stop explaining awkward jokes to your children when you watch movies that are supposedly for their age range. That's the beauty of these films, they are good fun for any age, and usually you're bored to tears watching movies with your kids but these you'll get into instantly.

Its the same plot done wonderfully differently each film: (for those who have never seen 3 ninjas) 3 brothers given ninja names Rocky, Colt and Tum Tum get training from their Japanese grandfather Mori over summers. Its family tradition. And with their ninja skills they experience a great deal of martial arts involved adventure. In this particular movie they fly to Japan to present the winner of a martial arts competition with a valuable dagger; their grandfather was supposed to do it but he got into a car accident and wasn't able to. In the meantime the rewarded dagger is actually an ancient key that's said to open a cave of gold, so here comes your conflict as goons come after them for it. And that is the movie in a nutshell.

Its shot nice and clean, you can make out every trick and technique- which I love- movies of today are all flash and matrix slow motion and its honestly very weak in my opinion. If you've never seen this movie or any of them, I do hope you give it a buy because its a collectable of a time looong gone. You'll think about it when its over, you'll find yourself watching it again. I'm so thankful for DVDs because I warped a lot of tapes ahaha.",1406678400,,1482,4.464944649446495

3 Ninjas Kick Back (1994) **1/2 / 4
D: Charles T. Kanganis
C: Victor Wong, Max Elliott Slade, Sean Fox, J. Evan Bonifant, Caroline Junko King, Dustin Nguyen P: The title ninjas must do battle with their grandfather's rival, a wealthy tycoon who is out to steal a sacred dagger.

The original 3 Ninjas was pretty much a ripoff of Home Alone with some martial arts thrown in. However, it turned out to be one of the most financially successful films of 1992, so a sequel was commissioned.

3 Ninjas Kick Back is more ambitious then its original counterpart as it features a bit more plot and has our young heroes trotting the globe. The kids are appealing. It moves along at a nice pace. The violence has been softened to make it more family friendly. A female character who is just as skilled at martial arts as our main characters is introduced to make this entry marketable to both young boys and young girls. The kids at the center of the film learn a little bit about themselves and each other along the way.

It's one of those films that's been made for a select audience, namely young boys who are into martial arts. It's just about as good as a film of this type is going to be. It will go over the heads of most adults sitting in the audience, but the film's target audience (kids) will be thoroughly entertained by it. [PG] 99 mins.",1389139200,,1449,4.4772727272727275
615106,4,6303191975,One of my favorite movies as a kid. There is some stupid humor but it's target audiance will love it. I live with seven 6-10 year olds and they laugh all they way through it.,1386633600,,174,4.0

615109,5,6303191975,Fun for the whole family.  The kids in the movie are great.  Action packed.  Highly recommend for children of all ages.,1358553600,,119,4.571428571428571

615179,4,6303191975,Super fun age appropriate boy stuff.  My 5 year old laughs out loud every time he watches these movies.  They were recommended by a 16 year old friend who had loved them growing up.,1357344000,,181,4.294117647058823

615181,4,6303191975,"This is a great movie for kids. You can put this in and not have to worry about content. It is not as good as the original, but from what I can tell, kids don't know the difference. It's a great series for kids.",1318118400,,211,3.8181818181818183
615182,4,6303191975,This movie is a great movie for kids.  I enjoyed it as a young child or preteen and now my son (age 5) is loving the three ninjas movies. The acting could be better but the movie is obviously geared toward young kids and they will like it.  All three ninja movies are without rude or vulgar humor and there isn't any bad language.  Adults too will enjoy the movie as long as you realize it is geared toward children.  I would say the target audience is between the ages of 4 and 10 and the movie will definetely meet their expectations.,1303171200,,536,4.2254901960784315
615183,5,6303191975,Just a great movie. My kids loved it so I bought the DVD's for my Grandkids.,1275436800,,76,3.8125
615184,1,6303191975,I swear that this should've kept in mind the age difference in this movie.  The rest of the films seemed to run quite well except this one where they had Rocky and Colt look like they were 16 or 17!,1216080000,,198,3.95
615185,5,6303191975,This and Surf Ninjas are awesome. This movie has slapstick humor and would reccomend for kids or people who are really high.,1208217600,,124,4.681818181818182
615186,5,6303191975,If you have the fist and last movie in this trilogy I think you should buy the 3 ninjas kick back because if you like high kicking fun and adventure and in this movie the 3 ninjas traval tha japan to give a knife to the winner of a ninja contest it is geat fun a recomend this movie t0 anybody that is interested in ninja and likes fun moments,1197331200,,343,3.914285714285714
615187,4,6303191975,My youngest son loves this movie and my older sons remember watching it when they were younger.  Fun movie.,1196035200,,107,4.631578947368421
615237,4,6303191975,"Victor Wong does it again with his cinematic Ninja-y magic, and the boys are back this time and ready to kick some serious booty!  This movie is a pure delight.

After the first 3 Ninjas movie, I was thinking how great that these 3 Ninjas can work together to fight the powers of evil, because ninjas customarily work very independently, like a brain surgeon or electrician would.  Masters of the ninja sciences know that they are bound by duty, honor, and super high kicks, so to find 3 Ninjas that are on the same page...well, that's just amazing.

The story of 3 Ninjas Kick Back is loosely based on the famous novel ""A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich,"" and for history buffs the film is like a whirlwind travelogue set during the decline of the Roman Empire, with very clear allegorical references to the struggles between the infamous Rasputin and Catherine the Great.  When the 3 Ninjas find their three backs against the wall, they fight bad guys like they are going out of style!!!

I love 2/3 of the ninjas, but there's one I just can't stand.  You know the one I'm talking about.  He's lousy.

A brilliant movie that will make you glad to be a ninja or a lover of ninjas.",1178064000,3,1184,4.444444444444445
615238,4,6303191975,"As with my review in 3 Ninjas Knuckle Up, I have to make something clear. The original 3 Ninjas trilogy was released out of order. First came 3 Ninjas (1992), then 3 Ninjas Knuckle Up which was shot back to back with the first movie (also 1992) though not released until 1995, then 3 Ninjas Kick Back (1994) which is actually the 3rd installment of the official triology. Having said that, I will now review 3 Ninjas Kick Back. Now I realize that alot of the reviewers favor the original 3 Ninjas but for some reason I tend to favor Ninjas Kick Back a bit more. Anyway, the humor and the fight/action scenes are all good and not so much over-the-top as was in the 2nd movie 3 Ninjas Knuckle Up. The actors of the parents of the 3 Ninjas from the first film return (the mom is kind of a babe in my opinion), Victor Wong returns yet a third time as the grandfather, and Max Elliot Slade returns for the third time as Colt. The actors for Rocky and Tum Tum are different but still do a good job. I also liked the soundtrack to this movie as well. I especially liked the tune that followed everytime Tum Tum yells ""Scramble!"". As for the plot, the 3 Ninjas get a chance to go to Japan with their grandfather but little do they know that an enemy from their grandfather's youth has been plotting revenge. That's all I will give away concerning the plot though trust me, the plot is good. Other things I liked about this movie are the character developments and the brief insight of the japanese culture regarding sight seeing. As for the characters, the 3 Ninjas act more grown up with the exception of Tum Tum and the main villain's goons aren't quite as dumbed down as was in the first two movies. 3 Ninjas Kick Back completes the third of the official trilogy. Like the others, however, the DVD has no extras. This is sad! Oh, if you are a fan of the 3 Ninjas films then you may want to stay clear of the fourth installment with Hulk Hogan. It is geared towards small children in addition to none of the actors from the previous films returning with the exception of a brief appearance of Victor Wong as the grandfather. Of course if you are a parent, you may not consider these flaws to be a bad thing but just remember... I told you so!",1150934400,4,2236,4.300947867298579

615240,4,6303191975,In my own Opinion I like the sequel better even though it didn't had the original Rocky and Tum Tum. The reason Is because it was in japan and there were more action and the comedy and humor was great. Its about the the 3 ninjas go to japan to give the dagar that there grandpa left behind by a mistake but turns out they have to go to the martial art competition to present it to the winner. They meet miko a GIRL !!! that wins the competition and helps the 3 ninjas fight there way against KOLGA against his greed for the dagger. This is a movie you cant miss you can sit and watch it a million times and it never gets old so just get its better then the original.,1089158400,,666,3.9776119402985075
615241,5,6303191975,"This movie is a great sequal to the first 3 Ninjas movie, and for this trilogy (I know there is a 4th one, but come on... if you've seen it you'll know why I'd rather call this a trilogy). I love this movie, almost as much as the other 2! The only set-backs are Rockey and Tum Tum, because they're obviously different people. BUT nonetheless, BUY this movie, because it is worth every penny. These movies are those certain movies that you can watch a million times and still find it very entertaining. I like Daren, cuz his real life name is Scott, which rules. Props to Max Elliot Slade cuz he was the only ninja in all 3 movies. Another sweet fact --- the umpire in the baseball game at the beginning and end if i remember, is Don Stark. He plays Donna's dad on That 70's Show. AWESOME! So, with whatever money you have... get 3 Ninjas, 3 Ninjas Kick Back, and 3 Ninjas Knuckle Up... you won't regret it no matter how old or young you are! PEACE OUT",1086134400,3,951,4.230769230769231

615243,5,6303191975,"I absolutely ADORE this movie! 3 NINJAS KICK BACK rocks. It's da bomb. I love it. Max Elliott Slade as Colt is sooooo hot and adoreable, you can't help it but just love him. Sean Fox as Rocky isn't that great, he's kind of geeky. But I liked J. Evan Bonifant as Tumtum, he's pretty cool, too. Still, it's kind of a shame that Michael Trenor and Chad Power didn't come back as Rocky and Tumtum...but I'm sure glad Max Elliott Slade came back as Colt! In this totally awesome sequel of 3 NINJAS, the 3 NINJAS KICK BACK is basically about Colt, Rocky, and Tumtum going to Japan to help their grandfather out who is sick, I think (I haven't seen these movies in so long!). While there, they meet a Martial Arts champion who Colt tried to compete against in a Martial Arts tournament -- who surprisngly turns out to be a girl, Miyo! (Played by Caroline Junko King.) With Miyo's help, they find a way to help their father beat these bad guys and Rocky finds a girlfriend in Miyo.
