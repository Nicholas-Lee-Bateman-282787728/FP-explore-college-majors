Taking spills down concrete hills in the park in wheel barrows and big wheels and much more. This show is not exactly for kids. I watched this show when i was in junior high and couldn't stop laughing at the stupid and hilarious things these guys did. All the spoken dialogue by the crew is still edited by beeps or the curse words have been removed. Strangely the newly added music to segments that had popular rock songs and other types of music the vulgarity is present in the songs.

Only slight negative is for people who may have watched the movies before these. The movies set the bar so high and are so graphic that some of the stuff on this set seems extremely tame in comparison, especially the first volume. But if you are a true fan of Jackass or are just looking for a good laugh then this set is definitely for you.

The fecal matter, the urine, the dildos, the anal exposures, but... most of all, MOST OF ALL... the constant self-injuring of themselves for no reason, are so educational!

I highly recommend watching of the series to anyone who otherwise might have trouble understanding what is currently going on: the many wars of Barry, his peace Nobel, US currency down the toilet, the big bank bailouts with tax money, the indiscriminate adoptions of little boys, and many other things too progressive for the simple-minded folk to comprehend. Watch Jackasses and you will grasp what is really going on, the full picture, in no time!

It is truly an eye-opening show. Highly recommended!",1364774400,,821,4.815602836879433

2415230,3,B000BDH69O,"Let me start off saying I'm a HUGE jackass fan, and I also had all these on tape before buying this for when it was $20. It was great to get it on DVD and much better quality which is why I'll say it was worth the purchase for me. However this ""Complete Boxset"" is missing dozens and dozens of skits. I watched all 3 seasons so many times over the years that I noticed some right away and had to look up the rest on google. Thankfully I still have my tapes I believe so I can go back and miss some of them that were missing. If you don't own any at all than I'd recommend this for sure. Also it claims to be ""uncensored"" and ""uncut"", but that just isn't true unless you're watching the commentary. All over the top curse words are still cut out and everything is still blurred which I guess can be expected either way. Just watched the whole set the past couple days, and although it did let me down in some ways, in many others I'm very glad I bought it overall.",1336003200,4,963,4.047120418848167

2415232,5,B000BDH69O,"I've been looking for this set for a long time and when I finally got it for my birthday I was extremely excited. I have been a fan of the show since it came out in 2000 and this box set did not disappoint. The disc plays just like a normal episode of Jackass plus unreleased skits, what I mean by that is that they aren't in any sort of specific order, it's just skits played together like a regular episode, they aren't in alphabetical or chronological order, they're just there. I think though as a true fan of Jackass you'll appreciate the random order of things, I mean it is called Jackass--can you really expect that it be perfectly ordered?

My only comment is that while some of the skits are missing, look into ""Jackass: The Lost Tapes"", it should clear up anything you were looking for when watching the Box Set.

If you are a fan of Jackass, and have been from the beginning then you won't be disappointed by this box set.",1315180800,,934,4.331428571428572
2415233,5,B000BDH69O,"First off, i'll address the main issue i've read in some of these review so here are a few

1. I cant believe its not in episodic format.

So What... the last time I checked jackass wasn't a episodic.. its just random funny stunts with no real story

2. Its missing all the knoxville intros.

True but they were included in the lost tapes

3. ""the lost tapes"" should have been included.

i agree. but its just a few goods stunts missing nothing to cry about.

  And so on, but anyway these people tend to leave out what is great about this set. Not only does it include all three volumes, but thier remixed with a lot of extra stunts, and it come with a bonus disc with alot of cool stuff like two brad pitt stunts/skits. On top of it all it comes with a bonus booklet which most will find fairly interesting.

  all in all if your a true jackass fan, don't listen to the people who bad mouth this set it is F@#$ING amazing to say the least.

2415234,4,B000BDH69O,This is an awsome collection of jackass.  It has most of the segments but dose not have all of them.  With jackass the lost tapes it has a little more but still not all of them.  over all it was a good collection.  Watching it really got me ready to see Jackass 3D.,1286928000,,265,3.943396226415094
2415255,3,B000BDH69O,"There are a lot of classic jackass skits on the first 2 discs of this 3 disc set, but waaaaay too much is missing to call it a definitive box set. In the book that comes in the set, you can read about skits that you'll never see here because there not included (get god out of california). Anyway, for all that is missing, there is a lot of great jackass here, and if you can find this set for 20$ or under, I say def get it.

1st two discs are all skits (with commentary available on both), 3rd disc is bonus material (where are they now, MTV cribs, gumball rally 3000, an MTV VMA appearance) and there is an extra bonus disc with the ""top ten best jackass moments""",1283126400,,666,4.083969465648855

all three seasons of the TV show plus a 4th DVD with gumball rally 3000 , were are they now , Cribs via Jackass crews digs, and outtakes.

My only disapoinment is they should have a jackass the movies box set  jackass the movie, Jackass 2 , Jackass 2.5 , Jackass 3  like they did for the TV series, also the comentary is a riot

The box set also includes a book with insigfht into the behind the sceens look into the making of the show.

Also it is missing clips. Its not a box set. The other previous sets Volume 1, 2, & 3  has the whole clips. Well I never got one But I had two and three and I was more impressed with that than I was this set. MAJOR disappointment to Jackass fans all around the world.",1241740800,,468,3.9157894736842107

The movie didn't hide anything. lol.",1236038400,,344,4.2272727272727275
2415262,4,B000BDH69O,"Having owned Jackass the Movie and Jackass 2, I eagerly anticipated the box set, a collection of MTV episodes.

However, while the majority of the jokes and stunts were amusing/entertaining, it paled in comparison with the movies. The movies had:

1) Better resolution/picture quality
2) Relatively better staging of stunts
3) Gnarlier stuff",1230681600,,341,5.415094339622642

There is also a cast interview which is really funny and then there is cribs with some of them, that is just insane.  I would really recommend getting the complete box set rather then just the separated seasons because of the bonus disk and the little booklet.",1200614400,,519,4.108910891089109
2415283,2,B000BDH69O,"I was watching this in its entirety recently and I got pretty annoyed when I discovered that the milk drinking challenge was nowhere to be found on any of the discs. You get a flash of it in a montage at the start of one of the discs but that's it. In fact, as you pore through the set, you slowly start to realize that there are a couple of skits that are missing besides that one.

I have no idea why these skits are missing and in all honesty, it's a disappointment when you discover that what you're holding in your hands isn't the definitive Jackass collection that it should've been. Maybe it was legal issues? It'd have to be. I couldn't tell you exactly how many skits are missing but the information should be available somewhere. It's definitely more than a couple.

While there's a lot of crazy antics to sit through (and even with the missing skits, it's still a lot of stuff) including extra documentaries and stuff, I wouldn't really consider this set to be that well put together. I agree with someone else's opinion that instead of just lumping everything together, they should have kept the episodes intact. I don't mind that they still censor out the profanity but watching skit after skit after skit in no particular context gets boring. The set also comes with a decent little photo book with disc details plus behind the scenes info.

To make a long story short, had this have been a true completist's set, I'd have recommended it easily. The fact that it's not, coupled with the fact that it's missing my favorite skit from any of the episodes make this a box set that I can't recommend in good conscience. Especially to a die-hard Jackass fan.",1180137600,6,1666,4.528239202657807

If they ever come out with all the episodes i don't know if I'll  buy it or not but I'll be piss that they did this.",1175817600,2,391,3.6547619047619047

2415286,4,B000BDH69O,"This box set delivers everything it promises: the complete Jackass.

2415288,2,B000BDH69O,"I don't mind that the original bleeped-out words are still bleeped on the DVDs... that's how the show was. (For example, I think the Viva La Bam DVDs would, for the most part, be funnier with the original tv bleeps.)

I don't mind that the original blacked-out and pixelated views are there... that's how the show was (and trust me, we're better for it).

With that being said, here's the real problem -- this is not presented in an as-aired episode format. Of course I should have realized that ""volume"" does not mean ""season"", but ""season"" is what everyone expects from a tv show DVD. That's how every other tv show is realeased; even the Wildboyz and Viva la Bam DVDs are presented in episode format.

This box set lacks because the bits are somehow funnier when viewed in context of the original episode. The recurring themes within the episodes are funnier. It's also much more convenient to sit down and watch an episode or two whenever you want. Instead, it all gets lost in the 2-hour marathon format of each ""volume"". Additionally, as many reviewers have mentioned, many of the classic bits are absent from this set.

Bottom line is, before you purchase this set, realize that many of the bits you remember may be missing. Also realize that each ""volume"" is a marathon of strung-together bits, and you will not see the actual episodes.

I suggest that die-hard Jackass fans actually not buy this set, because I think you will be more frustrated and upset in the end. Because of the ""volume"" format, you will probably only watch each disc once, then quickly retire it to the shelf. I regret that someone spent some good money buying this as a gift for me. I would gladly return it for only half it's original price if I could.",1159660800,47,1734,4.598705501618123

2415292,1,B000BDH69O,"Don't get burned.  Here's why:

- Incomplete.  A lot of classic clips are missing from this set.  Blatant Example: The booklet has pictures and a small writeup on the ""Keep God out of California"" skit - but reading about it in the booklet is all you'll get to do, they didn't put the skit on the DVDs.  Read the rest of the reviews here for just a few of the dozens of major skits you won't get to see with this set.

- Censorship. I want to hear every damn word.  With the stunts these guys have been pulling for years, swear words and the occasional private patch are the last things Paramount needs to worry about protecting us from.  I held off on buying Volume 2 and Volume 3 because they were bleeped and blurred, and I would have passed on this box set too if I had taken the time to research this.  Shame on me.

- Format.  It's a mess, tossed together like a CKY disc.  Still fun to watch, but it should have been kept in it's original episode format, in order of air date.  Don't get any expectations of bouncing on the couch in time to the awesome intro theme, or being welcomed to the episode by Knoxville like you may be used to.

I'm ticked that I dropped a hefty chunk of money on a set that was put together with no regard for the show's legacy.  Material is either missing, edited, or censored - I'll bet those Paramount bigwigs even censored the missing skits before they dumped them from the DVD set.  What a waste of something beautiful.",1145923200,75,1457,4.243636363636363

On the other hand, they didn't include the best skits of the series so I don't understand why they call it ""the box set"". If you'd watch it in the ""play all"" option you could see there was no link between some of the skits because some of them were missing. It's just too dissapointing.

It's better to record it off the reruns.

Don't buy this box set.",1141171200,4,574,4.39622641509434
2415326,2,B000BDH69O,"I was really psyched to get this boxset, but, I've got to say that I'm a bit disapointed after viewing it.  Don't get me wrong, I had a blast watching it, but THEY LEFT OUT TOO MANY CLASSIC CLIPS!?!

Where was Johnny Knoxville jumping the L.A. River?

Where was the Self-Defence Test?

Where was the Human BBQ?

Where was the shock collar? Or the Poo Poo Platter?

What about the Poo Hug?  Or Ehren McGhehey's No Shirt, No Shoes, No Service?

And how could they have left out Eddie's Auto?  Come on!

It's not like they left out some obscure clips... these are some of the all-time classics!

It's like releasing a Beatles Greatest Hits CD and not including She Loves You, Hard Days Night, I Am the Walrus, Hey Jude, etc.

So, MTV, what gives?

That said, for the $40.00 odd bucks that I payed for it, well, I had some laughs, but the let down of not seeing those clips (and most of those were the ones I was really looking forward to seeing again) just left a really bad taste in my mouth.

Oh well.",1140739200,4,1000,4.25
2415327,5,B000BDH69O,"This box set is perfect. There are tons more stunts than on the previous two released discs. A lot of the stunts include cast and crew commentary. The bonus disc has the Gumball Rally which is pretty fun, complete with a cast commentary! You can also see how Pontius used to live out of his truck! This is a great DVD set that also includes a neat little jackass book about some of the stunts. This complete set will deliver loads and loads of laughs for hours and hours!",1139961600,,471,4.303370786516854
2415328,4,B000BDH69O,This DVD is not uncensored. It still blocks out the private parts and bleeps the curse words.  But otherwise it is great because when you wanna see more stupidity just pop in another DVD from the box.,1139616000,2,200,4.405405405405405
2415329,3,B000BDH69O,"I've seen all the episodes of Jackass before, but I thought I'd get this box set for the extra features. The thing that annoys me the most is that it's not in episode format, they've taken all the skits from a season and put them in random order for no apparent reason. It says 5 hours of unseen footage, but I'm yet to come accross a skit that I've not seen before, and I've noticed that some skits are actually edited. Ehren McGehey's 'blindfolded skateboarding' skit has been cut down to less than half it's original length.

The commentary is very good though. I just don't get why they screwed with everything else. If it's not broken, don't fix it.",1138406400,,654,4.45

The booklet was poorly done.

It was really a waste of money. Avoid buying.",1135641600,4,322,4.161290322580645

2415345,5,B000BDH69O,"I like a lot of MTV's shows but I have never laughed so hard at one of their shows than I did while watching Jackass. I have volumes two and three already and I dying without volume one which is the best in the series. Not only does this set have volume one but it contains updated versions of two and three. Two and three had pretty lousy special features compared to the movie's bonus material but the set blows those away.

If every box set had this many special features than every DVD would be such a great value. The set tells us what our favorite troublemakers are doing now in a 40 minute documentary. Not only that but it has deleted scenes, television appearance, and the Cribs special which was very good. I was so surprised at how great these features were. I know some skits aren't included but I'm just happy that they made up for it with all the new bonus features. This set is perfect for anyone who loved Jackass and I highly recommend it. Great job Paramount.",1135036800,15,977,4.33879781420765

2415347,5,B000BDH69O,"Okay let me first address two things :

1)  Paramount did NOT refuse to release full seasons of the Jackass show, they were not ALLOWED to for legal reasons that none of us will probably ever know.  Anyway, if they COULD, they WOULD - I don't know why the last reviewer mentioned greed.  Paramount would make a buttload of money if they released full seasons of Jackass.  They simply cannot - legal bull...

2)  The ""Never Before Seen Footage"" is - really - Never Before Seen Jackass footage, not CKY footage used under the Jackass title.

Also, DON'T BE MISLED or misunderstand - this DVD is NOT uncensored.  Cuss words (both on the show and the commentaries) are 'bleeped' out and all blurs remain intact.  Every once in a while in the commentary a cuss word misses the censors - but that doesn't make it UNcensored.  So don't think the F***s and S***s will all now be audible - they won't be.  Nonetheless...

This DVD Is GREAT!!!  And I am guessing that any skits that weren't released on the DVD weren't released for - again - legal reasons.  The 'Keep God Out Of Califonia' skit probably couldn't be legally cleared for release on the DVD, that simple.

The bonus features are what MAKE this box set.  Disc one has like 50+ skits never released.  Discs 2 and 3 are revamped too.  And I mean, come on - the WHOLE Gumball Rally, cast commentaries that (when you can understand what they are actually saying) are hilarious, and a ""Where are They Now"" feature that is really cool.  Oh yeah - and even more on top of that.  If you liked Jackass but wanted more when you were watching the show - here's your ticket in.

The DVD is GREAT, like I said.  Well worth the buy.  And if you are a fan of Jackass (or just stoopid TV) this is most CERTAINLY worth the buy.

2415348,3,B000BDH69O,"First of I'd like to say that I love the show. And if this were the complete Jackass I would give it a 5 Star rating. But I bought this yesterday and after viewing it all I can say without a doubt that a big part of what made the series great is missing from this box set. Sure it has a 48 page booklet with insight from mysterious guy who never really identifies himself, but rather narrarates the lifespan of Jackass, and sure there is the Bonus disc with the Brad Pitt skits ""Abduction"" and ""Night Monkey 2"". But there is still so much missing that I and most of the true fans of the series will want to see.

Such as the ""Keep God out of California"" skit

How about you release all the seasons one by one the way any other show would have had it done, Paramount?

Oh yeah Greed.

If you must have it now, its a decent collection.

2415349,1,B000BDH69O,"now this dvd still has 2 more days until its released but i can probably sum it up for you right now. first off let me say i loved the show Jackass and thought it was one of the funniest things ive ever seen on tv. when i saw that it was gonna be made into a box set collection i was all amped up to get it but then i thought about something. i thought about the offers in this dvd such as never before seen skits and whatnot and then i thought about who is releasing this dvd, thats right Mtv home video is. im not dogging out the show and im not saying anything bad about this dvd set yet for it hasn't been veiwed yet but all im saying is pleased be warned about how much of this ""never before seen"" stuff has been seen. i noticed when watching the show that there was a big chunk of the show that were old clips of Bam Margera ""CKY"" movies and i have a really strong feeling that some of the never before seen clips will be stuff from earlier CKY videos that couldn't make it on tv which in my mind would be a scam. for example look at the new Beavis and Butthead collection. its great to have it on dvd but MTV home video really ripped us off big time with that one.
