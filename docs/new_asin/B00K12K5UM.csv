6398234,2,B00K12K5UM,"I was so bored watching this and kept waiting for it to get better.  I think it somehow missed the point and had to do with the lead girl, a pubescent child, having her mom die of cancer and the related psychological damage that made her feel alone and needing acceptance. The film was very cinema verite, literal in it's delivery.  It wasn't about her coming of age sexually but of a child crying out for attention and love.",1423612800,,425,4.367088607594937

Like 9 out 10 independent films it was very weird/different but I think that's sometimes what makes independent films so good, however this one was aight . .  I mean would I watch it again NO . . but it is not like you think it is going to be. I felt sorry for the girl and I didn't understand why she felt the need to have to act the way she was in the film. then again maybe that was the message.

6398239,3,B00K12K5UM,"An unusual film, both intoxicating and frustrating.  The storyline turns on Lila, a teenage virgin who is both jealous of and intrigued by the sexual experience of her best friend.  As a result, Lila inserts herself into the life of a male college student who, as far as she can see, will sleep with anyone.  This is the first feature by director Eliza Hittman, and it is elevated by her ability to conjure atmosphere via images.  She is clearly confident and in control behind the camera.  The film is directed in such a way as to invite the use of the terms ""tone poem"" or ""mood poem.""  Soft-focus closeups result in an intense, almost uncomfortable intimacy with the characters.  The localesthe crowded beach, small yards adorned with clotheslinesand the subdued, yet diverse color palette are evocative of summertime in the city or rather a melancholy, nostalgic idea of summertime in the city.

In regard to content, to the storyline and its cast of characters, the ultra-slight 80-minute feature is an end-of-innocence story designed for maximum discomfort.  Beyond a charming, pint-sized neighbor who functions as Lila's confidant and her confusing father (is he neglectful or just distracted?), men here are portrayed as one-note bros and thugs.  Uncaring studs who squeeze and manhandle and leer.  The camera lingers on their hard, tattooed bodies, as well as their horn-dog stares and cruel laughs.  The specter of potential rape rears its unpleasant head more than once as Lila, played in a natural, but limited performance by doe-eyed newcomer Gina Piersanti, again and again finds herself encircled by them, very much in over her head.  (She is berated at one point for shifting into domestic gear, cleaning up an apartment overflowing with red Solo cups, but then, of course, allowed to continue.)  I am sure the director's thesis involves the perils adolescent females face as they discover and explore their sexual urges, and the film undoubtedly conveys such perils with disturbing present-tense urgency, but I believe it would be improved by more time, space, and imagination.  Then, for example, the characters (male and female) might become three-dimensional beings rather than cultural archetypes.  There are more satisfying and substantial films covering similar ground, including Catherine Breillat's Fat Girl, Cate Shortland's Somersault, and Andrea Arnold's Fish Tank.",1407369600,,2393,5.257894736842105
6398240,1,B00K12K5UM,"I rented this film because of the high ratings on rotten tomatoes.  I have to disagree with the critics, as this movie clearly lacked substance to bring you in and get attached to the main character.  It felt like I was waiting for something to happen for the hour and 23 minutes, but I left feeling unsatisfied.  The climax begged for your imagination and didn't leave any definitive ending, which was also a bummer.",1406332800,2,417,4.608108108108108
6398241,3,B00K12K5UM,"Independent films often times are very odd motion pictures, if just because they usually try to tell a story which doesnt feel like something you are used to seeing. With this though comes a risk of not connecting with the audience for if it is too weird or just is hard to connect with. As for It Felt Like Love, while a coming of age film which certainly seems to want to stand out, I don't know if it may connect with you.

Characters & Story

Poor Lila (Gina Piersanti) has seemingly lived the life of being best friend Chiaras (Giovanna Salimeni) 3rd wheel for who knows how long. And with them both approaching 16, and Lila living vicariously through Chiara, it seems Lila is ready to try to get out there, date, and fall in love. Leading us to watch as Lila pursues this guy named Sammy (Ronen Rubinstein) who is cute, knows Chiara, and seems like someone decent.

Praise

Films which deal with self-discovery, especially during the teen years, are usually from varied perspectives but almost every single one of the deal with being validated by winning the attention of someone. This one is no different, but what I like about this one is that Lila comes off utterly average. She doesnt seem to have the appeal Chiara has which makes guys gravitate to her, she isn't the best dancer so she doesnt have a draw there, and her being such a basic run of the mill person makes her so strangely relatable. For without any bells and whistles, all she has is the fact she is human and wants attention and affection.

And while, Ill admit, I wasn't too fond how she went for it, at the same time you can understand her sort of silent desperation to connect with someone she wanted to care for her. Also, shifting things to Chiara, while she may have all the stuff a guy may want, the issue is, as we see with the first guy introduced Patrick (Jesse Cordasco), that even having what is desirable isn't all it is cracked up to be for it comes with its own issues. For then you have to deal with insecure boys, not being treated as you feel you should, and while Chiara certainly isn't the main focus, she does show that rarely seen side of the girl who has it all, and yet still cant really get the ideal.

Criticism

Leading to the criticism which perhaps could be taken as a praise depending how you look at it. This filmed feels like they filmed an actual persons life, and with that comes this dullness which may give authenticity, but creates an immense sense of boredom. For with the film feeling like it represents a two week period, in which there isn't much in terms of growth really, you are left wondering what is the film trying to put out there? Unless the main goal was simply finishing the film. For with this being Writer/ Director Eliza Hitmans first film, as well as the first film for many of the actors, I almost feel this wasn't made necessarily to show off talent, but simply for exposure for the young artist, and Hitman gaining a sense of accomplishment by finishing a film and getting it out there.

With this feeling, and noting this is the first movie for nearly all involved, I feel this weird need to give this film a pass for having a weak story, and sort of bland characters. And yet, at the same time I feel like I should still compare this to other indie movies and call it out for being lackluster.

Overall: TV Viewing

Honestly, a part of me wants to say you should skip this. Yet, at the same time I value the fact that for most of those involved this was their first big film and while it may not have been to my liking, it doesnt mean it is horrible. If anything, it is one of those films in which you have to respect the conditions of how it was made and who took part in making it. Also, with Lila we get the rare girl who seems perfectly average. She isn't rich, doesnt have much to offer but her time, and yet still, like any of us, believes she is worthy of someone she likes loving her. And it makes me want applaud the film for it certainly reminds you of the value indie movies have for they try to portray something different than usually seen. And while between the directors vision, and the ultimate produce, it may not have seemed to have worked, you have to admire all that was done so you even get to see the film. So, taking note of what was said, Im labeling this as TV Viewing for it may not be exemplary, but it is adequate.",1405209600,4,4378,4.328048780487805

Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0

""It Felt Like Love"" is first-time writer-director Eliza Hittman's coming-of-age meditation on a Brooklyn teenager's burgeoning sexuality. The teenager in question is Lila who lives with her permissive, aging hippie of a father and occasionally brags about imaginary sexual exploits to Nate, a boy who lives in the neighborhood. The mother is not a factor, having died of cancer some years before.

Lila spends most of her time with her good friend Chiara and her boyfriend, Patrick. While with them at the beach, she makes the acquaintance of Sammy, an older college student who she ends up pursuing. When Sammy gets drunk and passes out, Lila crawls into bed with him. The next morning Sammy can't remember anything and Lila implies that maybe they had sex together.

Mike D'Angelo, writing in ""Dissolve,"" bemoans the generic nature of the world Lila inhabits: ""Lila exists in an art-movie void, with no friends or interests that don't directly reflect her predicament; the film is set in the present (characters text each other, etc.), but so strenuously avoids any sort of cultural specificity that just a few revisions could shift it to 1987...That sort of sparseness can be deliberate--a means of conveying timelessness--but here it just seems like a failure of imagination, turning Lila into an emblem rather than a girl.""

Eventually Lila finds herself over her head when she finds herself alone with the older guys. Matt Seitz of ""RogerEbert.com"" describes the encounter but remains dissatisfied: ""Several scenes in which Lila hangs out with Sammy and his buddies in a man-cave are mortifying. She is clearly an interloper, and they treat her like one, and somehow their snickering indifference and dimwit innuendo are part of the male-female dance in this world. Lila's closed-off expressions suggest that she if not welcomes, at least expects to be treated with contempt. These rec room scenes rank with the most pessimistic depictions of teen sexuality in recent cinema. Yet however heartfelt and keenly observed this pessimism is, it becomes monotonous.

A.A. Dowd of the ""A.V. Club"" gets to the essence of ""It Felt Like Love's"" limitations: ""Lila, for all the authentic awkwardness Piersanti breathes into her, is defined so entirely by her mission--embarked upon with an equal measure of anxiety and anticipation--that she never quite comes alive as a character.""

""It Felt Like Love"" has some impressive cinematography but Ms. Hittman's one-note portrait of teenage obsession, prevents us from believing that these are real people. Nonetheless, I see good things for this director in the future, as this film still shows potential.",1423872000,,2712,5.192219679633867
