2466772,4,B000CNF80W,So why have I watched it ten times? Why do I keep replaying the song clips and interviews? Why do some of the lines he muttered keep running through my head like a continuous loop? Why is Ralph Emory such a clueless twit? Guess you'll have to buy it if you want the answers.,1151539200,15,274,4.092592592592593
2466773,5,B000CNF80W,"Townes is an artist of such huge talent, soul, vision, and charisma, that he can make the rest look trivial by comparison.  In this sensitive documentary, one sees about as much of him as anyone who never got to see him perform live will ever experience, and I thank the filmmaker for her outstanding work.  It just kills me that I discovered Townes too late; from all accounts when he was at his best he could mesmerize an audience.  Yes, he was a tortured soul and hurt pretty much everyone who loved him along the way.  But his family and friends make it clear that he tried to fight off his demons, even as he wrote and played songs so gorgeous, spare, and evocative they could draw tears from a stone statue.",1146009600,18,713,4.378787878787879
2466774,4,B000CNF80W,"As a friend of the Late, Great, Townes Van Zandt; and as someone who saw him perform many times and who collected all of his recordings, I can tell you from first-hand experience that his story is one of the most compelling of any singer/songwriter the U.S. has ever produced. An amazing talent, with a bent for self-destruction, Townes was a unique and singular voice in the Pop Culture Era.  His story has needed to be told, warts and all, and I give this DVD, grudgingly, four stars because it will hopefully introduce more people to this icon of American Music. However, there are several flaws in the film. One glaring misrepresentation is that this is an ""Original"" documentary-style film. In truth, this film relies heavily on clips from ""Heartworn Highways"", a 1975 film that was released in ""Art Houses"" in major cities across America back in the late 70's, early 80's. ""Heartworn Highways"" was a film about the Guy/Susanna Clark, Townes, Steve Earle, Rodney Crowell contingent of ""New Breed"" singer/songwriters that split their time between Austin and Nashville singing together, drinking together, and buddying up; just having a great time. For someone who is familiar with Townes's story, there is very little here that hasn't already been told. This is really for people who have never heard of Townes or who have heard of him through the wind and are curious about who he was.  There still is a lot missing here, as the characters that were close to him, like ex-wives and musical associates, are never really defined in the film. These kinds of omissions diminsh the full story that still needs to be told about Townes. There is a lack of depth and direction to this film that will make it difficult for people to tie together, with any kind of chronology, the pieces of this complex artist's life. There are very few, if any, details about who is who in the film. There isn't much of a reference, if any, as to where and when certain clips were taken in order to give the story a sense of history and movement. Like I said before, though, it's better than not having anything out there at the present time about this great American Poet and visionary.",1144972800,18,2167,4.715039577836412
2466775,5,B000CNF80W,"Townes Van Zandt was a manic-depressive, an alcoholic, and a great songwriter.  He played a guitar and sang his songs, although the best-known versions of the songs are by others: Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard, and Emmylou Harris to name a few. The songs ""Tecumseh Valley, Poncho and Lefty, If I Needed You, and Waiting Around to to Die"" are as good as any you'll find.  Steve Earle, another Texas singer/songwriter, said TVZ was the greatest songwriter in the world.

This documentary features TVZ singing many of his songs while we witness his deterioration.  He died at age 52 of complications following a broken hip and (probably) an overdose of alcohol.  Nobody was suprised.  Guy Clark says at his funeral that he ""booked this gig 30 years ago.""  TVZ never made any money nor sold many records, but it's a pretty good guess that people will be singing his songs for the next 100  years.  They're that good.

Among the people talking about TVZ in this film are his wives (three), children, and a host of other singers: Kris Kristofferson, Willie, Emmylou, Clark, Earle, and a bunch more.  It's a touching and a frightening story.  The story of TVZ is a bit like that of Vincent Van Gogh:  immensely talented artists --but nobody envies them for their lives.

2466776,5,B000CNF80W,"Having been a fan of Townes Van Zant since his first lp, and seeing him live through the good an the bad, I found this dvd a wonderful tribute to a very gifted songwriter

Yes there are many sad times, and I will miss` townes forever, but I am glad I have this dvd, for not only is it full of great music, but it tells of how life really is. We all have choices, and mine will be to cherish Townes through his music for the rest of my life!",1142899200,8,440,3.8351648351648353
2466777,5,B000CNF80W,"I had the date for this DVD's release on my calendar for months. I had read reviews of its insights, and those combined with all the stories I heard about Townes Van Zandt over the years had me literally counting the days until I could see this documentary. I discovered Townes' music ten years ago, and as someone who plays guitar and writes songs I have always found his music to be some of the most inspiring I have ever heard. For years I have read about his legendary drinking and gambling, so I knew that this would be touched on in the film. However, I was unprepared for the sheer self destructiveness that plagued Townes Van Zandt's life. Even more disturbing to me was the senselessness of it all. I had always wondered what Townes was up to in the years from the late seventies to the late eighties, when his discography suggests that he literally disappeared. This film touches on this but never really answers the question. The film is clear that Townes began a follow up to ""The Late Great Townes Van Zandt"" which was titled ""7 Come 11"" (and should have given him the push into superstar status he deserved), and Townes' producer Kevin Eggers acknowledges that he did not release ""The Nashville Sessions"" until twenty years after it was recorded, but the exact reasons as to why were not made clear. This inexplicable failure to promote Townes Van Zandt's music is something that really bothers me, especially since it seems that he did nothing but begin a downward spiral creatively and personally from that time on. Steve Earle remembered witnessing Townes playing russian roulette on his porch in the late seventies with a .357 Magnum, and expressed his dismay and anger throughout the film at witnessing what was the world's greatest songwriter (and his hero) being so callous about his talent and his life. It seems that these ""lost years"" contributed to his decline, although one gets the sense that Townes didn't know what he was looking for or what he wanted to achieve. When questioned in an interview about what his goals were, it seems Townes had never thought about it (or didn't have any), and he struggles with the question until he answered that he would like to write a song that no one would understand, including himself. As the film nears its end, the shocking transformation of Townes into a skeletal alcoholic was especially disturbing to me, as was the obvious deterioration of his guitar skills and voice in the later live footage shown. Although Townes was definitely a complex individual and obviously a very funny man (the bonus interviews have a few stories that really cracked me up), this documentary left me feeling sad. I never realized that all these years of listening to his music had made me care so much about Townes. I guess it goes along with what Steve Earle said in the film, that it's always your heroes that let you down. Maybe it's because you find out that they are human beings with faults just like everyone else, but Townes Van Zandt had a gift for music that not many possess, and I'm sorry that his demons took him so early.",1142899200,141,3087,4.66605504587156
2466778,5,B000CNF80W,"I waited months to view this film. Being a big fan of Texas based music and musicians I have heard for years what an inspiration Townes was on various Texas songwriters. After veiwing this film I did not know if I should give it 5 stars or 0 stars. This film is a horror story of a life that was unfilled. It is a story of a musical genius that not only lost his way, but may in fact never knew were he was going. His musical legacy and talent will forever be know to ""true"" musicians but in all never by the mainstream public.

His talent while undeniable was undiscovered because way down deep, he would not allow himself to be discovered. Townes surounded himself with people who protected him, but more sadily by people who encouraged, supported and promoted his self-demise. In interviews with 3 wives and multiple children at no time did one of them say stop, at no time did any of his so-called friends discuss the selfdestructive path he was on. The title of this film should not have said ""Be here to love me"", but rather ""Be here to use me.""

A tragic, jaw dropping film of a life lost, a talent unrecognized and demonstrates the true life of a musical genius, hopefully the next musician with ""Townes"" talent will suround himself with better friends.",1142726400,9,1261,4.454545454545454
2466779,5,B000CNF80W,"I only saw this once, in a theater at a University, after waiting weeks in which documentaries were scheduled but I failed to find anything else I would go out in the cold to see.  I already own a CD of `high, low, and in between' which includes the songs of `The Late, Great Townes Van Zandt.'  I was expecting `Poncho and Lefty' and 'If I Needed You' to show up in this film.  Those songs were the high point of his life, familiar to people who still have not heard of him.  A song with cards made sense in this film because I had heard it before, but Townes Van Zandt was not one to make too much sense, and this film follows his footsteps pretty closely.

This documentary does not dwell on the treatments Townes Van Zandt received as a mental patient.  A doctor was able to keep him from enlisting in the military, but his wife was astounded at getting such a candid assessment for someone who was able to make enough money to buy food to eat by playing in a club on Friday nights.  Sometimes it seems the insulin shock treatments were successful in wiping out the memory of his life up to that point, but when he was recorded as saying that he remembered the feeling of falling four stories to land flat on his back, and how it felt, was that recorded before he was treated for being suicidal or afterward?  Kris Kristofferson is one person in this film who emphatically says that living on the road is precisely as Townes Van Zandt described it in the song `Poncho and Lefty.'  Kris has had breath as hard as kerosene.  The gruesome details relate to dying on New Year's Day, 1997, at the age of 52, shortly after having an operation to fix a broken hip that broke eight days before he went to the hospital.  My sympathy was strongest when he was trying to identify a goal for himself; he hoped he could write a song that no one would understand.  He was more interested in songs than in life as a normal person, but he had wives and kids more than once.  If you know his songs well, his failure to sing more than a line or two when he had an audience is not quite as bad as if you went to a performance and could not tell when he was singing or what he was saying and only thought you better not waste any time trying to listen because he might be a genius, and you'd just feel stupid trying to figure it out.",1134777600,15,2317,4.191441441441442

I think the Texas Monthly 1998 said it so well:  ""Townes was a holy mess, his life a mix of the sublime and the horrific. By the time he died of a heart attack at 52 on New Years Day, 1997, the Fort Worth native had written a large batch of enduring songs and become the subject of colorful talesmany of them even true. And yet he remains today what he was all his wild, heartbreaking life: a cult artist honored by peers and ardent fans but largely unknown in the mainstream. He never released an album on a major label. He was never a music business professional and was never much concerned with his career. He was never concerned with much of anything, in fact, but writing, touring, and hanging out with friends and family. He loved paradoxliving it and spreading it. Born into comfort, he preferred the company of the poor and desperate and sometimes gambled away what money he had. He was a lighthearted prankster who wrote some of the saddest songs of the century. He sang about how precious it was to be alive yet spent a good deal of his life killing himself with drugs and alcohol. A kind of death cult grew up around him fed by stories and mythsome of his own making, some of his fans, many of whom saw romance in his self-destruction. When he died on January 1, 1997the same day his hero Hank Williams had died in 1953the most surprising thing was that he had lived so long"".",1412553600,7,1632,4.264516129032258

I had to keep stopping this film because the pain of watching it is so upsetting. Then a little while later I'd be drawn back to continuing the story. I'd already read books on Van Zandt, and I'd seen another film about him. I know the story, and yet it's intoxicating to read and see it again and again.

2466912,5,B000CNF80W,"I've loved the music of Townes Van Zandt for many years, so I was happy to find out that a documentary existed with his story. The documentary is formed out of archival footage, as well as recent interviews with his surviving contemporaries and collaborators. Born into money, but an infamous substance abuser who had most of his teeth replaced after a glue sniffing incident, he lived in the gutter, sang, wrote music, and left a trail of destruction. At the end are interviews with his kids, some of whom hardly knew him.

First of all, Joe Ely, who was a musical partner from the very start, is interviewed, talking about alone-ness versus loneliness, broke versus poor, and how Townes was always the better, more Zen-like of the two. Guy Clark noted how Townes' songs ""are sparse, they don't spell everything out for you. They allow you to use your imagination and allow you to be sucked in."" He also had a great sense of humor, as demonstrated with one show where he said ""I'll now play a medley of my hit.""

Townes got into glue sniffin' while playing high school football, and signed in his yearbook ""from one junky to another."" Recounts the story of intentionally falling from his fourth floor apartment onto his back just to feel the sensation. Fran Lohr, his first wife, talks about their life together. He got ""insulin shock"" to the point where he couldn't recognise his own mother. Burned out his childhood memories. Plays a beautiful version of ""Dollar Bill Blues"" live without whatever noise it was that they added to the recording. First song he wrote was ""Waitin' Around To Die."" Townes and Janis Joplin hangin' out. Ken Eggers, record producer, Tomato Records owner in Chelsea Hotel. Wrecks Bell, bass player, spoke of Townes' fame after the Our Mother The Mountain. Lightnin' Hopkins interviewed. David Olney - ""a woman ripped off her blouse at the start of the set."" JT Van Zandt looks like Townes, but with a cleft chin. Steve Earle, Burt and Susanna Clark. Townes ""admired"" Susanna, and she looked like a pretty funky person when she was young. Professor Longhair also interviewed in movie. Guy was jealous of Townes - on camera he's laughing, but you can tell he's also angry. Was into heroin in Houston, never into it when he was elsewhere because he wouldn't know where to get it (probably a good thing too). They interview him about glue sniffing while someone else fires off shotgun blasts, he then tells the story of being DOA for 90 minutes before he came back to life. He was heart dead every 2-3 months. Weed made him neurotic, alcohol psychotic. Peggy Underwood, lawyer, saw him shoot cola and bourbon. Played ""Waiting Around To Die"", an old black man next to him was in tears. Katie Bell Van Zandt, daughter, interviewed in Nashville in 2002. A French interviewer tells him ""Blues is happy music"", he answers ""oh yes, I agree."" ""Gold And Mud"" from a TV in a Texas bar, re-creating his life and sensibilities, hanging around in bars waiting to die... Steve Earle found a nice cabin for him, learned that he was fascinated with morning glories. Townes put Steve's gun to his head, pulled trigger three times. Steve was pissed!! Townes wrote ""If I Needed You"" in his sleep - dreamed he was singing it, wrote it down when he woke up. Jeanene Van Zandt, third wife. Steve Shelly, the drummer of Sonic Youth, is on hand to tell the tales of Townes' death. Lyle Lovett sings ""Flyin"" Shoes"" at Townes' funeral. Guy Clark gets the last laugh: ""I booked this gig 30 years ago.

Beautiful stuff.",1380412800,3,3516,4.695299837925446
2466913,5,B000CNF80W,"I first saw Townes Van Zandt in 1968 at the Good News Coffee Shop in San Antonio, before his first album (For the Sake of the Song) was released.  He blew everyone away.  I was a teenager and knew he was great, but it took a few years for me to appreciate how rare his talent was.  I bought every album I saw, but even in Texas they weren't always easy to find. Over the next decade I saw Townes in Austin at Castle Creek (with the Hemmer Ridge Mountain Boys-- Wrecks Bell and Mickey White)and at a small, dark, former Italian restaurant, the Rome Inn.  Townes played one set well at the Rome, took a break, and came back too stoned to play.  It was sad to see.

Last time I saw him was the early '90s in a Safeway in South Austin where he was buying diapers, apparently for Katie Bell. Music lost a magnificent if tortured talent when Townes passed.  This is a fine documentary about his life, with interviews of everyone who knew him best.  But to know Townes you need to know more of his music.

It is also very disturbing at how his life declined due to various reasons.
It does seem however that he was comfortable with his choices, and I feel his choices were a great driver in his work.  His songs are like poetry and reveal a lot about the struggles he faced  every day.

His pain and suffering, as well as simple joys, perfectly expressed in his songs.

I loved this film because it gave depth to Townes' as a person, but it won't ever explain where those songs came from or how their simple words affected so many of us.  'To Live is to Fly' really haunts me.  It's such simplistic a song at a first glance, but the meaning has only become profound as I age and feel the highs and lows of this life, perhaps through a lens which Townes had a role in shaping.

I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to learn about Townes or just watch a creative movie about a unique individual who had struggles but was able to deal with them and create some beautiful music that entertained, encouraged others and helped people realize that they are not alone in the difficulties Life may bring. 5 stars",1310860800,,584,4.85
2466939,5,B000CNF80W,"I think Margaret Brown [the Director of the DVD] did an excellent job on this ""Be Here To Love Me"" DVD and I honestly do 'not' feel that there is any degree of duplicity with what I would highly recommend as an equally excellent 'companion' to this DVD about Townes Van Zandt, ""Heartworn Highways."" Each DVD, IMO anyway and so stated, stands on its own with its own focus and highlights. One DVD compliments the other. IMO. Further, both DVD's contain ample special and bonus features and which are not duplicated in any way.

BTW, and as a sidebar to other TVZ fans reading this, in the ""Heartworn Highways"" DVD [** filmed in 1975 but not released until 1981] and in the scene where TVZ interviews ""Uncle"" Seymour Washington and again when TVZ plays ""a medley of my hit"" [sic -- TVZ], ""Pancho and Lefty"", in 'Unc' Washington's kitchen, anyway, 'who' is that long haired girl? Just curious. She appears at least three times in the ""Heartworn Highways"" DVD but nowhere can I find who she is! Again, just curious.

I highly recommend the ""Be Here To Love Me"" DVD and the copious interviews therein both in the documentary and in the bonus features. And I also recommend the 'companion' DVD, ""Heartworn Highways."" BTW and again addressing TVZ fans, and of which I am one including playing TVZ songs on the guitar, check out the TVZ website where a 3rd TVZ DVD is available [** while there are umpteen TVZ CD's available, TVZ DVD's are unfortunately rather limited!], anyway, check out the DVD ""Townes Van Zandt: Live In Amsterdam"" which is equally enjoyable. So too some excellent bios out there on TVZ. And yeah, you can always tell a true-blue TVZ fan and picking up on the ""little things"" as when they ask and ponder the 'why' of it, to wit, ""So WHY did Townes introduce himself and then ""Geraldine"" [his beloved dog] 'before' introducing his then girlfriend, ""Cindy"" ? Hey! WHY did TVZ lean backwards and fall from that apartment complex balcony! Or the ""gold tooth"" thing! Or various other ""why did he 'do' that?"" inquiries on TVZ, well, as Steve Earle or Guy Clark might quip, ""Why not! Hey, that was Townes Van Zandt!"" ;-)

Guy, Emmylou, Steve Earl, JT, Nancy, etc. There was footage in it of Townes signing Pancho and Lefty from an ACL show from the mid-70's. BHTLM also contains footage from the same concert, this time singing Dollar Bill Blues. It is outstanding live footage and probably the best performance of his career that was actually captured on a good quality tape. WHERE IS THIS? Why has not ACL released this on DVD? This is a vital piece of Texas music history, of ACL history, of country music history and it is sitting in a vault somewhere.

Margaret Brown, in her commentary, alludes to a lot of footage that did not get used. Can someone put together another documentary, maybe one that focues on his writing and performances? There is obviously plenty of rare footage that is waiting to be used.",1291680000,4,861,4.6644736842105265

In one scene, he is shown smiling while he is playing, ""Waiting Around to Die"" to an audience of 2 and as I listened I came close to tears. In fact, the man who was behind him, started out smiling as he listened and ended up with large tears rolling down his cheeks.  His music has the power to do that to you, even in a video.

The film doesn't minimize his addictions and the effect it had on his life and the pain inflicted on the people who loved him.  It was also clear that he cared about them too.  He inspired loyalty because, in his own way, he was loyal.

Early in the film, he is heard saying that he didn't expect to live long and that his life would end before his work was finished because ""I've designed it that way."" True to his prediction, he was still trying to finish one more record when he left us.  I'm sure he is still writing and performing his songs in that other place.

This Doc gives detail about his life from the early years to his death and gives a good picture of what it's like to pursue your dreams. What amazes me most is that the success he did achieve never went to his head. He actually pushed it away. To him it was all about the song.,1279324800,,433,4.228915662650603
2466944,4,B000CNF80W,"Few people epitomize the tortured artist better than songwriter Townes Van Zandt. Though he was held in great esteem by critics and his fellow musicians, Van Zandt's music did not sell well. Moreover, he had a tragic personal life that led to his death in 1997.

Van Zandt has gotten his belated due. Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard, and Emmylou Harris have taken Van Zandt's songs to the top of the charts. Now, filmmaker Margaret Brown continues this renaissance with her biographical documentary ""Be Here to Love Me.""

Brown provides viewers with an excellent overview of Van Zandt's music and life. Viewers hear well-known musicians express their admiration for Van Zandt. The film also helps explain why Van Zandt struggled to find commercial success. (Often, he sabotaged his own career).

The best parts of the film delve into Van Zandt's complex personality. Van Zandt was an unhappy person who was married three times, underwent shock treatments, and descended into alcoholism. In one graphic scene, Steve Earle explains how he saw Van Zandt play Russian roulette.

It is best to look at this film as an introduction to Van Zandt. 100 minutes simply isn't enough time to explain fully the issues that the film raises. Still, Be Here to Love Me is fascinating.",1274659200,2,1265,4.981042654028436

2466946,4,B000CNF80W,"The main points of this review have been used to review Townes Van Zandt CDs in this space. They can serve here as well in this very well done documentary by Margaret Brown on the hard times and great lyrics of a very troubled man.

Readers of this space are by now very aware that I am in search of and working my way through various types of American roots music. In shorthand, running through what others have termed ""The American Songbook"". Thus I have spent no little time going through the work of seemingly every musician who rates space in the august place. From blues giants, folk legends, classic rock `n' roll artists down through the second and third layers of those milieus out in the backwoods and small, hideaway music spots that dot the American musical landscape.

I have also given a nod to more R&B, rockabilly and popular song artists then one reasonably need to know about. I have, however, other than the absolutely obligatory passing nods to the likes of Hank Williams and Patsy Cline spent very ink on more traditional Country music, what used to be called the Nashville sound. What gives?

Whatever my personal musical preferences there is no question that the country music work of, for example, the likes of George Jones, Loretta Lynn and Tammy Wynette in earlier times or Garth Brooks and Faith Hill a little later or today Keith Urban and Taylor Swift (I am cheating on these last two since I do not know their work and had to ask someone about them) ""speak"" to vast audiences out in the heartland. They just, for a number of reasons that need not be gone into here, do not ""speak"" to me. However, in the interest of ""full disclosure"" I must admit today that I had a ""country music moment"" about thirty years ago. That was the time of the ""outlaws"" of the country music scene. You know, Waylon (Jennings) and Willie (Nelson). Also Kris Kristofferson, Johnny Cash and Jerry Jeff Walker. Country Outlaws, get it? Guys and gals ( think of Jesse Colter)who broke from the Nashville/ Grand Old Opry mold by drinking hard, smoking plenty of dope and generally raising the kind of hell that the pious guardians of the Country Music Hall Of Fame would have had heart attacks over (at least in public). Oh, and did I say they wrote lyrics that spoke of love and longing, trouble with their ""old ladies"" (or ""old men""), and struggling to get through the day. Just an ordinary day's work in the music world but with their own outlandish twists on it.

All of the above is an extremely round about way to introduce the ""max daddy"" of my 'country music moment', Townes Van Zandt. For those who the name does not ring a bell perhaps his most famous work does, the much-covered ""Pancho And Lefty"". In some ways his personal biography exemplified the then ""new outlaw"" (assuming that Hank Williams and his gang were the original ones). Chronic childhood problems, including a stint in a mental hospital, drugs, drink, and some rather ""politically incorrect"" sexual attitudes. Nothing really new here, except out of this mix came some of the most haunting lyrics of longing, loneliness, depression, sadness and despair. And that is the ""milder"" stuff. Not exactly the stuff of Nashville. That is the point. The late Townes Van Zandt ""spoke"" to me (he died in 1997) in a way that Nashville never could. And, in the end, the other outlaws couldn't either. That, my friends, is the saga of my country moment. Listen up to any of the CDs listed below for the reason why Townes did.

Townes Van Zandt was, due to personal circumstances and the nature of the music industry, honored more highly among his fellow musicians than as an outright star of ""outlaw"" country music back in the day. That influence was felt through the sincerest form of flattery in the music industry- someone well known covering your song. Many of Townes' pieces, especially since his untimely death in 1997, have been covered by others, most famously Willie Nelson's cover of ""Pancho and Lefty"". However, Townes, whom I had seen a number of times in person in the late 1970's, was no mean performer of his own darkly compelling songs.",1243900800,,4116,4.671724137931035

The first time I was in my senior year of college, and Townes came through town (Nacogdoches, TX) and put on a simply captivating show.  His voice was fine, his guitar playing was good, and he told story after story that were side-achingly funny.  (And the girl I took to the concert thought I was really smart for knowing about this great ""folkie"" that she had never heard of.)

Five years later, I saw Townes at some little bar/mexican restaurant in Austin, where he was so drunk (and high, probably) that he could just barely perform.  And it would have probably been better for everyone if he hadn't, or if the manager of the place had pulled him off of the stage.

At first, I thought the second concert was just an anomoly.  But then the tales his his substance abuses and bouts with depression came to be widely known.  I thought it was a shame, because he definitely was a wonderful songwriter, and should have had a much more prominent career that he did.

This DVD is very well made, in my opinion, and helps to explain the two vastly different Townes Van Zandts that I witnessed in concert.  It pulls no punches about Townes and the demons he fought throughout his life.  The people interviewed in it loved him and were amazed by his talent, but couldn't really understand him. Sadly, this is often true with people who have the kinds of personal troubles that Townes did.

There is enough of the good Townes and the bad Townes in this documentary to show you that neither side was a fluke.  But it is disturbing to hear about his self-destructive behavior, and even to hear him talk about doing things that make no sense -- while at the same time he seemed not to have the desire or self-discipline to bring it to a halt.

I prefer to think of Townes as the guy that wrote ""Poncho and Lefty"" and ""If You Needed Me"".  But he also wrote ""Nothing"" and ""Waiting Around to Die"".  Steve Earle's description of Townes playing Russion roulette during one of his visits is very disturbing.  It leaves you asking yourself why someone would do that to a friend, and what was missing from his life that made his behavior so unfathomable?

This documentary tells you just about everything there is to know about Townes' life, but outside of spiritual beliefs, there is and never can be an answer as to why it seemingly had to be that way.  If anything is missing from this documentary, it would be any hint at all of a spiritual influence in his life.  As well made as it is, however, my guess would be that there was no such factor that could be honestly included.  And that also adds to the sadness.",1197763200,6,2642,4.439834024896266
2466952,3,B000CNF80W,"I thought this was a very good documentary. I didn't know much about Townes Van Zandt at all except that he wrote Pancho and Lefty. I thought it was shot really well and put together in an entertaining way. There was enough footage of Townes and interviews with him as well as concert footage to keep you interested. I also enjoyed listening to people tell stories about him and what he was like.

I recommend this to all of his fans and fans of country music. I also think there is enough there and it is entertaining enough for people who aren't necessarily fans of this type of music.",1192320000,,587,4.385321100917431
2466953,5,B000CNF80W,"Van Gogh, Hank Williams, Janis Joplin, Townes Van Zandt. Why are the greatest artists often so disturbed and self-destructive? I saw Townes play live once or twice around 1971 in Austin, and although I later became a music publisher and saw hundreds of singer-songwriters perform, I always rated Townes the best. He was young, happy, funny, chatty, and rolled out tunes that were captivating , stunning, hilarious, amazing. In the restroom with a grin on my face, the hippy next to me said, ""Are you digging Townes?"" Yeah, I was digging Townes. 25 years rolled by and I wondered what ever happened to him. I heard some of his songs on the radio but I never saw him play live again. Rumors had it that he had an alcohol problem, and when he died his friends didn't seem surprised. Another 10 years later, I saw this film on the Sundance channel and it broke my heart. If you were expecting a concert, well, go live your life a while and then come back, because it's not so much about music or even about Townes, it's about all of us and what it means to be human and our need to be connected to others, and about mental illness, and how lucky we are to survive each day, and how badly we need people like Townes to inspire us and show us the truth.",1189036800,32,1247,4.356223175965665

2466955,5,B000CNF80W,"Sadly we have very little on tape of this magnificent Texas artist.  But you should rejoice that this small sampling of his genius is here for you to love.  Townes bled onto the page of his songwriting.  He didn't possess a dynamic voice or corner the market on fingerpicking guitars, but he more than made up for this with his blistering words of human testimony . . . the art of writing lyrics better than the rest.  Townes was highly intelligent.  Gifted.  He gave his life completely to the task of providing humanity with a glimpse into the heart of a true down-country ""bluesman"".  His careful study of blues great Lightnin' Hopkins, for one, and how he idolized Hank Williams, great covers of other artists, his thorough knowledge of music history and the study of poetry gave considerable weight to his endeavor to bring all these mediums together.  He practiced daily to breathe new life into this brew of personal interests, his own personal ups and downs would, at last, find themselves onto the page in sparse words and musical phrases, capturing the very essence of his intended meaning.  Never content with a work, he'd go at it again to chisel a new work of art, trying to give what is impossible to give.  Each song of his shines a light into the dark corners our hearts, to make us laugh, make us cry, make us think.  Never mind personal faults, for we all have them.  He lived in pain and wrote songs that will resurrect your spirit.  His love of life is characterized in his lyrics but he could not restore his own while searching for the poet's words and heartfelt melodies, to keep body and soul together.  He was here with us only too briefly.  You will want to visit with Townes again and again for as many reasons as you can imagine for the rest of your life.",1176249600,7,1783,4.510903426791277

2466958,5,B000CNF80W,"Townes Van Zandt is revered in the music community for his ability to distill the essence of a song with a deftly picked acoustic guitar and brilliant lyrics that cut to the soul.

This biopic shows all sides of the songwriter; the genius, the alcoholic, the friend, the father, and the troubled soul.

I would highly recommend this for anyone who is a fan of Townes and anyone who wants a glimpse into the mind of a true musical visionary.",1162512000,13,440,4.4875
2466959,5,B000CNF80W,"I was in Austin in '74-'81 when Townes Van Zandt was already a legendary songwriter, was really cool, but was gradually ""losing his voice"". I loved his songs and loved listening and dancing to his music. Now I've subsequently found that I really knew nothing about this tremendously talented, fragile songwriter. What a wonderful but crushing experience it was to watch this documentary. Heartbreaking and captivating, Margaret Brown has captured an essence of Townes' songwriting and life that is so personal, so raw and sensitive, that one feels they are  personally hanging with him in the ""double-wides"", the pickups, and the clubs that provided the backdrop for his too, too short life. Wow, what a great flick! (and then check out Townes' live CD - ""Live at the Old Quarter, Houston Texas"").",1160784000,21,797,5.037878787878788
