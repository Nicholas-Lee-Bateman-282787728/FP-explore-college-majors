It is awesome to see Parnelli Jones dual it out with Mark Donohue along with other famous drivers of the period including Bob Tullius, Dan Gurney, David Hobbs and Sam Posey. Virtually all the Trans Am racers did Indy and NASCAR and Dirt, etc... The pony car era was a blast and this is a can't miss movie!

8165513,5,B000M0F8SM,"When I was a kid I can just remember this type of racing, you know, the cars they raced you could go to your dealer and buy them.
It is something we will not ever see again. I would have like to see more of the cars raceing, but I suppose I would say that because I can't get enough of the '60s raceing.

8165516,3,B000M0F8SM,There is alot of great old footage here but production left me wanting more.  It seems that maybe this was produced to fit in a television time slot or maybe to fit the old VHS format.  If you have any knowledge of the Trans-Am series there won't be much new for you here.  The vintage film is enjoyable either way.,1231804800,,315,4.216666666666667
