4573057,5,B0055CP9P4,"A friend of mine who get's advanced pressings of DVD releases just sent this to me as a gift knowing the huge fan I am of the show. Have watched the first 3 discs so far and I will say, you will not be let down!

Sound and video quality are TOP notch amazing. So good, that it makes you feel like your watching them on CBS back in the day on their original broadcasts.

So, if you're a fan and been waiting for this..BUY IT!!

I hope Shout Factory soon and quickly releases the remaining seasons of Kojak. This great show is too long overdue to be obscured to crappy quality and edited cable TV reruns. Let's remember real TV and not this crap they call TV today.

Had no idea about the horrid quality of the UK releases, so im glad I never got round to investing in any. Will just hope and wait for Shout to release the rest.",1315785600,16,826,4.080246913580247
4573058,2,B0055CP9P4,"Kojack was one cool cop! And a great TV show. But Shout Factory = CHEAP!
NO Closed Captions are SDH for the hard of hearing. Shout is to cheap to put them on.
No good remastering. Again to cheap. All shout can think of is. How much can we rip the fools off and put in are acount.
You will not get my money Shout.",1314403200,3,312,3.8153846153846156
4573059,5,B0055CP9P4,"Yes it been years sense the last US r1 release of Kojak which this is great news. Universal's release of s1 wasn't that bad except it was on flipside dvd's which my dvd player did not have issues with. Yes all the European sets of Kojak are horrible releases (I think their all bootleg sets, the dvds where captured off of ota vhs tapes or something just as god awful). If Shout does a nice basic remastering job like they did on Adam 12 the episodes Kojak s2 should be very watchable. Sense Kojak is one of 10 ten favorite cop shows it get 5 stars with a decent remaster. Hopefully s3 thur s5 roll out in quick order too.

Update 09/26/2011
Got my set early today and its a solid well made season set. Yes it does not have closed captioning or any extras but the set is nicely done. The episodes have been clean up (no dust, scratches, etc...) nice even color (but not psychedelically blown out like s2 of Wild Wild West) and decent sound and not on flipper disks . Shouts set is definitely bettter Kojak s1 released by Universal on flipper disks. It a nice serviceable season set decently made for me worth the 28 bucks I payed for it. For any US fan of Kojak I strongly recommend buying the set. The set flashes me back to the early 1970's when I was in grade school and faithfully watch Kojak every Sunday on my parents 1 st color TV a Zennith 24"" watching the wonderfully irreverent Theo Kojak patrol the streets of Manhattan island. Great fun I strongly recommend the set.",1313625600,2,1478,4.335740072202166
4573060,5,B0055CP9P4,"Shout! Factory does it again! They have listened to consumers and have invested in Kojak. ""Who Loves 'Ya Baby?""!

Please do not confuse the lower rated opinions of Kojak Season 2 on this thread with the upcoming Season 2 release by Shout!.

As someone who has purchased several Shout! Factory releases (Adam-12, Simon & Simon, Dennis The Menace, Mr. Ed) you will not be disappointed because they offer the original network run episodes and do not replace any music. The video transfers are in mint condition.

You will not have any problems with these Kojak DVD's because the Shout! releases are specifically made for equipment made in the United States, not for overseas machines.

The only way to have the three remaining seasons of Kojak released is to purchase each season as it becomes available.

Simon & Simon has fallen victim to fans not stepping up and rewarding Shout! by purchasing seasons 2-5. Now, Shout! has stated they have no plans to release the three remaining seasons of that wonderful series.

Shout! Factory invests a lot of money to give fans what they ask for. Let's show them our appreciation by purchasing these guality television series when they become available.",1313020800,39,1191,4.93
4573061,1,B0055CP9P4,Can someone please tell my why this series has been released in Europe before the United States?  What the hell is going on around here?  Get with it and release this great American show so all Americans can watch it.,1282867200,10,217,4.4
4573062,2,B0055CP9P4,"UPDATE: I notice Amazon has attributed this (and the reviews of many others) to the forthcoming 'Shout Factory' release of Kojak Season 2 - please note, my comments aren't in relation to their set. My comments are in relation to the European release via 'Mediumrare Entertainment' - I live in hope that 'Shout Factory' will remaster their set to the standard this show deserves!

The disclaimer at the start of each DVD did, I must admit, give me cause for concern - ""Please note that whilst every care has been taken to ensure the quality of the programme, due to the age of the original materials the technical quality of the programme may be slightly impaired in places"" Translation, ""Due to us being lazy and wanting to maximize profits, we simply couldn't be bothered to spend any money  on remastering  any of the episodes of this classic series"" - sorry, call me cynical but ""the age of the original materials"" - erm... this season is only 36 years old..! I'd expect to see such a disclaimer on material from the 1930s but not on a show from 1974! Sorry, as a fan of classic television, i.e. Perry Mason; Hawaii Five-0; Mannix and the like, I expect to see better!
Given the history of Kojak on DVD (a 5 year hiatus between the release of series 1 on disc and this season); I'd have expected them to be spending that time on cleaning up the episode prints for this release.
So, a word on the `quality', the episodes are simply washed out - they have the appearance of something you would have taped on VHS back in the days when the show was being re-run. Print wise, the episodes are watchable, but they lack any vibrancy and, in the main, appear washed out.  Colours are dull and the images lack any crispness. I mentioned `Perry Mason' earlier and I should point out that season 2 of that particular show was from 1958 and the print transfers of those episodes are superb - as are the other shows I mention and all of which began before Kojak!
I'm not sure if there have been any edits of the episodes themselves, but at an average of 48:30 per show, these episodes are a couple of minutes shorter in length than any of the other programmes from that era for which I'm familiar i.e. 5-0; Perry Mason and Mannix
I believe a review on here should be a balance between the show itself and the actual product. This season of Kojak, i.e. the show itself, merits 5 stars; the DVD release merits only 1.
Not sure why such an excellent series is given such a poor run when it comes to being released on DVD, but I must say, this release has made me appreciate remastering on other classic shows even more.",1272672000,36,2606,4.445606694560669
4573063,3,B0055CP9P4,"Seasons 2 and 3 are available in Europe (Amazons UK site has it a little cheaper than the one here).  These DVDs do not appear to have been remastered so if Film quality is critical, you will be disappointed.  The DVDs are very watchable, just don't  compare them to other releases of old TV shows that have been remastered.  These old Kojak episodes are better than anything new being offered on TV today, in my opinion anyway.  You will need an ""all region"" DVD player to watch this on an American DVD player.",1272153600,22,511,4.451612903225806

I watched the first season, which is crammed onto 3 double-sided discs, with great zeal. Then I started the second season, which is much more polished in look, only to be disappointed. Unlike the first season there are no episode summaries and neither are there captions or subtitles. I have slight hearing loss and like being able to see what's being said when I miss hearing it. Especially since the music and sound effects are loud, as they are in this series, and the dialogue normal or low.

Outstanding writing, characters you came to care about, wit, humor, the feel of dirty, almost bankrupt New York City. It's fascinating now to look back at the fashions, the sideburns, the cars -- those huge boat Buicks that cornered like the Titanic during a police chase -- the fact that cops didn't have computers and cell phones and had to run down the block to find a pay phone to call something in. Amazing also to see how women were portrayed: what we would now call sexual harassment was rampant, and there wasn't yet any real recourse, so that's how we working women lived. But the guys of Manhattan South were both heroic and anti-heroic, and we came to love Kojak, Crocker and Stavros through fine acting and good writing and directing.

4573243,5,B0055CP9P4,"Kojak  Season 1

This was a very popular television series back in the early 1970s. The first season has twenty two shows (fifty minutes each). These DVDs have excellent quality. Those old cars may bring back memories for those over fifty. Note the use of revolvers by the police. Often the bad guys use an automatic, a tradition going back to the 1930's. Car chases always add action to the story. In some scenes you can see people in the background standing on the sidewalks to watch the filming. Will the shows be as good as you remember them? This was one of my favorite shows then (I would sometimes recognize the street scenes). [This review is based on the older version of three double sided discs.]

I wonder how many such gun stores are in business today (Siege of Terror)? Would any police detective enter a place controlled by armed robbers (except in a drama)? The passage of many years makes some of these scenes implausible. A Manhattan store selling M 16s? Note the manual typewriters on the desks. Some of the actors seem familiar from other shows. Youll note some `political correctness in these scripts. One alarm clock reads Made in U.S.A., a sign from the past. After the show is nearly over the good guys win in the end. Then Kojak worries about the paperwork!

4573274,4,B0055CP9P4,"Overall, I'm happy with the work Shout! did on this release of Kojak: Season Two.  I've noticed a few visual imperfections here and there, but that's nothing!  Insignificant.  Overall the picture is clear and the sound is good (I watched it on my Dell computer).  If you have (or have seen) the first season of Kojak on dvd (from Universal) and were satisfied, you should be satisfied with this one, too.  Disregard the early reviews (regarding visual quality).  Also a good thing is that season two was released on single sided dvds, not double sided dvds (see photo), like with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kojak-Season-One/dp/B00005JNHT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kojak - Season One</a>.  Single sided is the way to go, and it's much more professional in my opinion.

Kojak: Season Two covers episodes shown on TV from September 1974 to March 1975.  And the episodes are GOOD!  The ones that really stood out to me are: ""The Chinatown Murders"" (Sept. 1974), ""Hush Now, Don't You Die"" (Sept. 1974) ""You Can't Tell a Hurt Man How to Holler"" (Oct. 1974).  But in my opinion ALL the episodes were good.  There was action, suspense and good storylines.  The acting was good also and Telly Savalas shines as Lieutenant Theo Kojak.

I've watched all 25 episodes of season two and I'll say this: Love the music, love the action, and love Kojak!

If you were a fan of the original Kojak series or like good police dramas - Buy it!

P.S.  I do have one small issue with the Kojak show (has nothing to do with shout!).  On disc three: episode ""Souvenir from Atlantic City"" (Nov. 1974), near the end an actor gets shot and dies (supposedly).  Kojak and Daniel J. Travanti (Hill Street Blues) say few words and then the camera pulls back to a wide shot, the actor just shot can still be seen.  He's lying on the ground.  The camera pulls back, and then stops. Then actor who was shot and was supposed to be dead in the scene - moves!  He lifts his head up, seems to look around, and then puts his head back down!  The guy was supposed to be dead now!  In my opinion that part should have been shot over again!  I know it seems a trivial thing, but that slip up took me out the story.",1338249600,,2219,4.701298701298701
4573275,2,B0055CP9P4,"EPISODE: HUSH NOW, DON'T YOU DIE  (NO Spoilers Included)

There aren't many -- actually, I don't recall ANY -- witty Kojak lines, such as ""Who loves ya?,"" ""Cock-a-roach,"" or any of his tension-breaking, ""funny"" touches in this episode.  It's rather straight laced and to the point.  No major plot twists or mysteries in this one either. (I deducted one star for not including any famous Kojak sayings!).

A college student gets raped by two bad guys.  (Remember, I'm not telling you more than any plot overview would). Right after the rape, with the girl laying there redressed again, the two guys have an argument over something VERY stupid and bad guy #1 shoots #2 but doesn't do any additional harm to the girl; he doesn't even threaten her!  But since bad guy #2 is now backstage and off the Kojak set since he's dead, Kojak comes screeching to the scene in some stock footage to investigate.

Kojak makes a few extremely lucky guesses, and before you know it, the show is over. But what happens to the bad guy that was on the loose?  Did he surrender; did the girl's father nail him?; did the girl's b/f get him?; or did something else happen to wrap up this episode?  You'll have to watch to find out!

All-in-all, I give this one just over 2 ""lollipops!"" (stars).  It wasn't good enough to round up to 3, so I kept it at 2.

Who loves ya' coochie coo?""",1333497600,,1359,4.475609756097561
4573276,3,B0055CP9P4,"THERE ARE NO SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW......First, I'm a huge KOJAK fan. I started watching Kojak back when it first aired in the 70's when I was a teenager.  But those days involved more important things to me than TV; specifically girls!  Now, as a man who just turned 50, I'm reliving my youth and watching Kojak again!
As for this episode, I'd give it just about 3 out of 5 lollipops!  In actuality, it probably deserves a tad less; somewhere between two and three stars which makes this an ""average"" episode.
One has to keep in mind the persona of Telly's Kojak hadn't been developed and refined as well as it gets starting in Season 3.  While there's some humorous Kojak antics and comments in this one, we don't hear any ""Who loves ya's;"" it's more straight-laced.  Not many plot twists either although there IS a ""missing link"" as to the exact reason in detail as to WHY the murders are being committed.  This is answered in a flashback scene about 90% in to the show. After that, the episode draws to a rapid conclusion without much excitement or viewer satisfaction (at least THIS viewer's). The acting is fair at best as far as the guest stars.

On a side note, if anyone watches this, do me a favor and look carefully at the scene near 30-35 minutes in when the killer opens the window and you can see the streets below.  There's a man in a blue shirt running as if he committed a crime although it has nothing to do with the episode!  I wonder if something else, perhaps another scene for another episode was being filmed while they had that area reserved for the filming of this episode.  I don't know...just a wild guess!",1333324800,,1634,4.453020134228188

One was on disc 5 Queen of the Gypsies, and thus I was unable to watch the entire episode. One episode on disc 2 did the same. I give it 3 stars because most episodes work fine, but not happy that they don't all work.  Happened again on the episode The Goodluck Bomber.",1329091200,,403,3.9753086419753085

4573289,5,B0055CP9P4,"I am a big fan of the old classic TV shows.  They are like a time machine, taking  you back to a time when things were much simpler.  This was no exception.  I grew up on Kojak.  It's refreshing to watch a cop show where they have to depend on deduction and reasoning without all the fancy DNA and lab tests done now.  Kojak was a real cop--tough when he has to be, but also compassionate, sometimes a little humorous.  I have two seasons of Kojak and am waiting on my third in March when it comes out.  Anyone who is in to the newer cop shows needs to watch these and see how things were done in the ""olden days""!

The quality of images is great.  Even the dark and gritty opening credits are crisp and sharp.  The quality of these videos is far superior to those of Season One by Universal.  This is work of the highest quality.  Hopefully we may expect the remainibg seasons of Kojak soon.  I intend to get the Complete Movie Collection set soon.  So go for it, baby.

It is jaw-dropping, simply. I've never seen a vintage TV show treated with such a dedication in order to bring the highest quality possible to dvd format. I'm telling you, it is almost of Blu-Ray quality if you watch it in a newer LED LCD screen. I was going to take one star out for the lack of subtitles but the picture and sound quality is just too good. I'd like to congratulate Shout Factory for this superb release and ask that -for the future ones- to have English and Spanish subtitles so I can send a few copies to my friends in South America who are devoted fans on this great cop TV show.

4573296,5,B0055CP9P4,"I like many other fans  bought the UK release as I live in England, but on hereing about This Shout factory Dvd and all that I read I just had to buy it and I must say this version is amazing. What I undersatnd about old T.V. shows is they are filmed in 35mm then its transfered to 2.1/4inch Video for television Broadcasting but they make hundreds of copys to ship around the networks/world and all these  large format videos can rot after a time if not looked after, much like 35mm film, so unless its restored it will not work well as we've seen from Mediumrare UK season 2 & 3. but 4 & 5 are  very good. Theres no info on any remastering on this Shout DVD but somthing has been done as its so very good, colour dos not bleed picture is much clearer shaper and the sound is much improved. After its been shown many times the Video tapes are returned to the studio where the just get stored this info came from  worker in the industry some years back so I recon there must be some truth in this, I`m not in the bizz but I`m sure theres people out there who know, I like everyone whos a fan have waited so long for KOJAK to comeout so I can't recommended this enough its a well worth the purchase enjoy.
Back in the 70s a T.V. Special was made on the making of Kojak and it had interviews with all the actors and loacation filmimg. the set thats Kojaks office and the squad room was infact an old factory in New York which once filming had ended it was pull down but for those who have shaper eyes will noties that as the seasons go by the Squad room changes size pehaps they moved some of the filming to another loacation, I remember seeing an a eposide being made and Telly salavas had to step over all the cables on the floor used for the filming, it would be so very cool if that show could be found it must be out there some place but I can`t remember who made it. Once again the filming around New York is amazing.
Theres no other show I can think of that had such amazing Scriped Telly Savalas had most of the best lines and I find myself quoteing them, in parts very funny lines also the storys where  very  good as well, so  all in all a Superb show many shows have tryed to copy the style of KOJAK  but to me failed Kojak to me is the BEST.
