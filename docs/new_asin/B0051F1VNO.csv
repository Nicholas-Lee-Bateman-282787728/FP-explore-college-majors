8452605,3,B0051F1VNO,"This documentary discusses an event in WWII following the sinking of USS Indianapolis before the remaining sailors are rescued as sharks scavenged the dead and they survived thirst due to lack of drinking water amongst other things, as well as the errors which prolonged their ordeal.",1459123200,4,284,5.195652173913044
8452606,5,B0051F1VNO,"I was shocked at such devastation and how the U.S. Navy allowed such a thing to happen. I thought it was unjust when they court marshalled the Admiral of the ship. None of what happened was his fault. The Navy should have never allowed the USS Indianapolis to sail out into Japanese infested waters unescorted. It was the commanders fault for letting that ship leave the port unescorted. He should have been court marshalled. And they had the Commander of the Japanese sub, that sank the USS Indianapolis, at the court marshall hearing. They should have arrested him  and prosecuted him as a war criminal. I was appalled when I watched this movie. I was terribly disturbed of the loss of so many of our men, and the terrible way in which they loss their lives at sea, defending our country when it could have been avoided.  I am a Vietnam War Veteran. I feel so badly when so many of us die in war especially when some of the deaths are unnecessary and could have been avoided. I was glad I watched this film. It just confirmed my feelings about how we go to war, the way we die, and how we get caught up into it unnecessarily. I shared this film with a lot of people who don't know or understand about the military, this country and why so many of our men die.",1430784000,11,1261,4.338983050847458
8452607,4,B0051F1VNO,"It is too much of a tragedy to love it.  Depressing because it is so real.
The Captain (a rank he never used himself) didn't deserve the blame,
even if the court martial was reversed.  The loss is too great for him
to live with and he took is life.  A useless protest but it was too painful
for him.",1384214400,8,299,3.95
