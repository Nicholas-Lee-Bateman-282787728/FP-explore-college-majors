6680067,5,B00NTSRTCW,"Great collection. Comes with all the movies, just as advertised, and a digital copy for Dawn (the newest film).

The original looks great on blu ray and the remake (yuck) and reboot looks great too.

Minor nitpick:
Although, I was a bit disappointed in the size of the collection. It's a rather small box set. The discs are in thin cases, with two movies in each case. So the actually set is about the size of two regular DVD (or three bluray cases) cases put together. This is a gripe for me and me only. I just like seeing rows of movies on my shelf. It doesn't look as pretty and its awkward not being able to put them in the correct order while having their spines facing outward.

This is a great price for a legendary movie series. I wish it was just a bit cheaper. Another set with only 7 films is almost 20 dollars cheaper, which is a huge difference for an imported series, but this one includes DotPotA, which sort of makes the price difference more justifiable.

(EDIT: The digital copy is for the UK and is not redeemable in the US)",1468022400,18,1044,4.311224489795919
