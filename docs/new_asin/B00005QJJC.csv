1648639,2,B00005QJJC,"Okay I taped this movie a long time ago and the end got cut off. I know it got scarier and scarier. This is the creepiest movie. If anybody could please tell me what happened at the end of this movie, I'd like to know. I threw the copy of this movie away cause I could relate to this girl and the relationship she had with her mom, and I had very bad sleep problems after this movie! didn't want the copy around anymore!! I could never watch it again but, I really want to know what happened!!",1299024000,,493,4.040816326530612

1648641,4,B00005QJJC,"THis is a great movie for SCi-Fi lovers.  i am one of them.  Markie post does a great job.  Lets face it i love movies.  i own about 2,000 movies.  You can too.  its nice to watch all your favorite whenever you want.  Buy them, its cheaper than going to the movies and buying popcorn and a drink.  Sit back and ENJOY!",1280707200,2,317,4.0
1648642,2,B00005QJJC,"This movie scared the living daylights out of me when I watched it as a child.  A word of advice: don't watch this movie with young children around unless you want them to develop a phobia of extraterrestrials.  To a five-year-old, this is one terrifying movie.",1277424000,2,261,4.6521739130434785
1648643,4,B00005QJJC,This was actually a pretty good movie. Not the one I was lookinf for. I was looking for a movie I saw when I was younger. Made before this one i'm sure. Wish someone could help me with it???,1198368000,2,190,3.8974358974358974
1648644,5,B00005QJJC,"I remembered seeing this move on TV many, many years ago. When I noticed it was avaliable on DVD I had to pick it up. This isn't the best alien movie I've seen but it is required to complete your Sci-Fi collection. Its a true classic. The star of the show played ""DJ Tanner"" from the old television show ""Full House"" with Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen.",1191974400,10,349,4.303030303030303
1648645,4,B00005QJJC,"This is actually a really good movie.  It's a made for T.V. movie.  I saw it for the first time on Lifetime, which isn't a station I would normally watch.  It's a movie based on alien abductions.  A mother and daughter are confronted with this.  At first, it starts with the daughter's loss of time and memory.  Later on in the movie, the mother goes to counceling and finds that she was abducted as well.  The plot thickens, but I would really hate to give it away.  This would probably be a good movie for anyone interested in aliens.  I'd say for the price of the DVD $$$go for it.  There aren't any extras on this DVD, but I would assume there would be on the one that will cost you a little more $$$",1031011200,26,704,4.148148148148148

1648647,4,B00005QJJC,"Accurate portrayal of the abduction phenomena as reported be leading researchers in the field. I was very surprised by the competency of this movie. Yes, it is a ""feel good"" ,""made for TV"" show. Yes, some of the acting was a bit ""thin"". All in all however, it is not a bad movie for people interested in the abduction subject. I think the story's biggest weakness is that these events would more than likely take place over years and not days. It could have easily been written more to that effect. I was very surprised that the writers and director where brave enough to introduce the alien human hybrids to the American audience. Creepy!",1425340800,,639,4.614035087719298
1648648,5,B00005QJJC,I got this because  I'm a Markie Post fan.  Excellent entry from Markie.  If I was a space alien I would want her too!  LOL!,1424822400,,124,3.84

1648651,5,B00005QJJC,visitors of the night is a very well made Alien Abduction movie with a great performance by Markie Post. This is one of the closest to Alien Abductions in a hollywood movie. Definitely worth getting this one.,1371686400,,208,4.648648648648648
1648652,2,B00005QJJC,"I've read that VISITORS OF THE NIGHT was a made-for-cable TV move. Specifically, it was made for the Lifetime -- ""Television for Women"" -- Channel.

Alas, it shows. Being a TV movie it's fullscreen, but I can live with that. Worse, however, is that the ""horror"" is diluted by the domestic drama.

Judith (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-Court/dp/B0030U1TCK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night Court</a>'s Markie Post) is a single mom who has nightmares about being abducted by aliens as a child. Now her own daughter, Katie, is wandering off at night, returning with blackouts, so she has no idea where she's been. Katie only recalls just having left the house -- yet it's three hours later! (Of course, we know Katie's being abducted by aliens too -- like mother like daughter.)

This being a 1995 TV movie (shot in Canada), I suppose it was an attempt to cash-in on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-X-Files/dp/B000BOH986/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The X-Files</a>, which was very hot at the time. However, this also being a Lifetime TV movie, there's no gore and scant scares.

I don't need gore for my horror, but&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-X-Files/dp/B000BOH986/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The X-Files</a>&nbsp;had much creepy tension and suspense. VISITORS OF THE NIGHT, not so much. Instead there's much domestic drama. Mother and daughter argue a lot, a result of their fears from suppressed memories of alien abduction. Occasionally, one of them wanders into a light, but that's mostly it for ""scares.""

We do FINALLY get aboard the alien spacecraft. It's potentially scary, at first. But it falls apart into the sort of crappy ""feel good"" message to be found in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/E-T/dp/B0087F7VSY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">E.T.</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cocoon/dp/B00020HAV0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cocoon</a>. Seems these aliens aren't so bad after all. Judith explains love to them, and how it's wrong to separate people, especially a mother and child.

This being a Lifetime movie, the women come off better than the men. Judith's divorced hubby is consumed with his career, never around. He's running for City Council. Luckily for him, his smart daughter turns his campaign around by educating him about environmental issues.

VISITORS OF THE NIGHT has lots of ""feel-good"" messages. But not so many scares.

If you're looking for alien abduction scares, the best film remains&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fire-in-the-Sky/dp/B0002V7O3S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fire in the Sky</a>, although&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fourth-Kind/dp/B003102JDC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fourth Kind</a>&nbsp;is also very good.",1366329600,,2987,7.010752688172043
1648653,5,B00005QJJC,"What a Great, Sleepy, little atmospheric made for TV thriller! I don't know about the rest of you- but I remember when they made fantastic movies for television. The networks don't do it anymore. I guess things have changed. This one grabs you from the very beginning with the horses running wild in the streets - but, from WHAT? Markie and Candace are both so lovely, and a very believable Mom and daughter, and the always way more than adequate Dale Midkiff as the Sheriff and would be suitor for Mom. The acting is first rate, even ""Elvis"" the family dog, the sets are lush and beautiful, but also very small town and ""folksey"". But there is something very, very sinister going on! There is alot of suspense, then resolution - then wait, that's it - a truly SHOCKING end that I did not see coming! I know I haven't really given too much away about the plot. When I watch this and other great made for TV movies I have purchased on DVD an absolute WAVE of nostalgia washes over me for some sentimental reason. This is and always will be one of my all time favorites!",1360454400,3,1068,4.398989898989899
1648654,4,B00005QJJC,there is nothing wrong with the movie itself but the color is poor. You'd think with our technology the coloring would have been enhanced,1356307200,,137,4.75
1648655,3,B00005QJJC,"This movie is watchable and fairly well done. My rating of 3 isn't bad at all. Some of the acting seems rather forced and unnatural in places. Some outdoor scenes (highlights) are ""blown out"", i.e. too bright. Although I don't necessarily agree with the basic tenet of many screenplays in this genre that ""aliens from outer space"" are behind this phenomena, something paranormal is certainly occurring to these unfortunate victims. Could the lack of prayer be a reason why certain families are victimized by these entities? Lastly, ""Visitors In The Night"" would probably only be ""scary"" to a victim. If you've been victimized, seek help. IMO, although the ending is sad since it offers no permanent resolution to their dilemma, it's certainly not ""scary"".",1322611200,,755,5.096774193548387

7950726,5,B00005QJJC,"This was a movie that was made for TV. I remember watching it on TV when I was a kid, and was surprised to find it on DVD. This is another movie that I'm glad to have in my collection. It's one of those unique finds, that's not going to be around forever. I'm actually surprised that it's still available on DVD, considering it was never made to be sold on DVD, in the first place.

This movie actually has a good amount of footage, with the aliens, which isn't that common. A lot of alien movies only give a glimpse or two, here and there. This movie isn't afraid to show the aliens, which I like, because that is the entire point of a movie like this.

If you enjoy alien movies, you should see this one, before it's too late. It looks like this movie isn't available directly from Amazon anymore, so it's probably reached the end of it's life, and will probably only become harder to find as the days go on.",1452211200,,910,4.194285714285714
