8232534,5,B000YFFEJI,"I just watched Pinafore, which I bought this for.  Songs and dances were choreographed and performed with clever imagination and flawless precision.  They were fantastic.  The acting was also fantastic.  Everyone performed as though they had the lead and the results were great.  I saw in the final credits that this was made for television.  That explained why one duet and a good 1/3 or more of the dialogue were cut. Nothing I am very glad to say was updated.  The whole thing was just a couple minutes under 90 minutes. Apparently Canadian TV doesn't have commercials.  America hasn't done anything this good for television since the specials of the 50s.  On the down side, the chorus and the captain's daughter were impossible to understand without a script, which I had.  With that in hand, I loved it all.",1514851200,,812,4.776978417266187
8232535,5,B000YFFEJI,"Gondoliers an excellent production, as was Pinafore. Trial was an older, black and white production; quite competent, but it didn't come to life.",1448582400,2,145,5.3478260869565215
8232536,3,B000YFFEJI,"I have seen other productions of these operettas.
Some I liked better, some not so much.  They left out several good lines and a whole song in Pinafore so I was disappointed.  I'm not as familiar with Gondoliers .  The dancing was good.  Trial by Jury seemed to lack the life that other productions have.",1385078400,2,304,4.472727272727273
8232537,5,B000YFFEJI,"I cannot conceive a more enjoyable package of this operetta.  The dance sequences, the humor that pervaded the performance, and the quality throughout were all of them near-overwhelming.  I highly recommend it to all zSavoyards.",1375315200,3,228,5.485714285714286
