7954704,2,B00005UM55,The video is very slow and boring.  Not a good workout for a person training to become a Firefighter.,1311292800,,101,4.315789473684211
7954705,5,B00005UM55,"I found this workout easy at first.  It got me back into an affective and great workout routine. When I started to perfect each movement and really concentrate on doing it well it became more and more difficult for me and therefore more of a challenge. As I progressed in building mass, endurance and strength, this workout progressed and changed form with me.  This is the only workout one will ever need when done properly.  I am grateful to the author for finding something that is a pleasure to stick to and is so empowering and powerful.",1019692800,7,542,4.56701030927835
7954706,1,B00005UM55,"Pace is too slow.  Instruction is boring.  Exercises do not amount to anything but the most *basic* of moves (squats, pushups, rows, bike situps, etc.).  B/c the pace is so slow, absolutely no intensity to the workout.  Plus the guy excudes absolutely no energy, making for an all-around poor purchase.",1019433600,6,302,4.98
7954707,5,B00005UM55,"I'm 33 years old with three daughters. The youngest being only eleven months. With quite the hectic lifestyle, there hasn't been much time to get back that flat stomach and defined [behind] and legs I once had. ..., I made myself a promise to get back in shape and feel good about myself again. As a gift to myself, I purchased The Firefighter's Workout Vidoe and began right away. The results have been amazing! This video offers three great workouts. I started with the less intense and within a short couple of weeks, moved to the more advanced. I do this video workout three times a week, and it only takes about thirty minutes. My girls don't even have time to miss me. Thank you for showing the real way to workout without wasting time and money. God bless all the Firefighters.",1015545600,5,784,4.528169014084507
7954708,1,B00005UM55,"This is not for the advanced. I had to do both workouts just to feel like it was worth my time and effort and I still feel like it was a waste of money. In addition, the instruction was boring. I have been doing various workout videos such as The Firm and Crunch for years with much success and found this to be a let down.",1015372800,3,323,3.909090909090909
