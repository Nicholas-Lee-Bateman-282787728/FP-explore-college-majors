8669825,3,B00M2D7KII,"Although Gabrielle has Williams syndrome, she is much like others girls in their 20s: she wants to be independent and she falls in love.  Unlike others her age, she cannot be fully independent, and her reliance on family members brings its own issues. The film movingly portrays her struggles, but also some significant triumphs.  On the down side: it is overly long, and it raises but, ultimately, skirts the hard issue of motherhood for the disabled.",1519171200,,452,4.934210526315789
8669826,4,B00M2D7KII,"This is a sweet and affecting character study about Gabrielle, a young woman and Williams syndrome sufferer who desperately wants to live on her own and with her boyfriend. Unfortunately, her family, condition and care facility are all in her way. I like how the movie makes you care for and empathize with Gabrielle without delving into sentimentality. This of course has a lot do with the very natural performance of Gabrielle Marion-Rivera, who has the syndrome herself.",1496275200,,473,5.076923076923077

8669828,5,B00M2D7KII,"Being different doesn't mean being better or worse, it just means being different.

And Gabrielle is different only in the sense she was stricken with a genetic aberration: Williams Syndrome. Yet, she lives or tries to live like everyone else; she wants an apartment, and she wants love to enter into her life. And she gets involved with everyday life. She joins a Montreal choir. And she tries to cook, yet she has a mishap with her toaster. Since this story takes place in Montreal, it's in French, yet an intermediate French student could follow along with the plot, trial and tribulations of Gabrielle and her sister Sophie.

Nonetheless, she is inflicted with Williams Syndrome, and everyday life could pose a danger to her health and safety. Her caretaker is her sister, Sophie, played by Melissa Desormeaux Poulin. As far as Gabrielle, she is played by Gabrielle Marion-Rivard, who in real life also has Williams Syndrome. Yet, she is well aware what others go through in everyday life, so she falls in love with Martin, a co-member of the choir, played by Alexandre Landry.

To say the least, this is a brilliant movie. Hats off to the director, Louise Archambautt, for taking a chance on directing this movie. This movie is so out of the sequence of a typical movie, it is a totally original work of film. I guess this is what made the movie work for me, it's original. It's not about spectacular lights, or flashy jewelry, it's about someone's life, who happens to have Williams Syndrome. Emotionally, this movie is gratifying. One roots for Gabrielle, to succeed in life. It makes one feel good to root for the underdog. And when the underdog does succeed: next feeling: pure joy.",1471564800,,1691,4.784246575342466

8669830,5,B00M2D7KII,"The film I am watching has nothing to do with a man who  is an author. This is a very special film starring someone with William's syndrome! Not only is the music beautiful, the topic is important.  Disabled people need to be able to have love relationships, and this film shows the difficulty connected to that need. I have taught disabled students, and they are 100% human,so many families with disabled kids could experience these same difficulties.  I cannot recommend this film enough, as it gently explores a very delicate topic.",1443744000,4,535,4.857142857142857

8669832,5,B00M2D7KII,So refreshing to see something outside the traditional Hollywood box.  Heartwarming yet heartbreaking.  Marion-Rivard leads a multitalented ensemble.,1435190400,3,149,7.222222222222222
