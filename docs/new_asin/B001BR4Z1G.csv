8284294,5,B001BR4Z1G,"This is one of the best step workouts I've ever done. The music, the queuing is so perfect and very motivating.  The content is challenging but sooner or later you can do it.  It's an energetic, practical, good-humored approach to fitness. Get ready for a zesty mix of squats, mambos, step touches and reverse-turn tangos. You can alternate between the two workouts on different days or pack both into a single fat-blasting session.  It is not ideal for a beginner as there are manu combos and turns. You will get it eventually as it is a build up routine.  If you like lots of combos and turns this is for you.",1500508800,,611,4.4774774774774775
