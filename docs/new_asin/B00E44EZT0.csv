5889819,5,B00E44EZT0,"WOW, now that is a woman to look up to! What she did was so pure of heart and she followed her Christian ways. I only wish I could help to make such a positive difference in my lifetime. Good for you, you ""Ordinary Hero""!!",1495756800,,222,3.9555555555555557
5889820,5,B00E44EZT0,"Wow, what brave, courageous people! I know that I am a coward. To think about how people would risk their lives, would not fight back, and continue to protest in peace, is beyond words. I wonder how the Civil Rights movement would have turned out, if they would have been armed? I would love to have that commitment, determination, drive, and a true belief in a cause that would jeopardise your very life. No, I don't have that. I'll sign a petition on change.org, but that's as far as I have gone. Such honorable young men and women who died to make such a valuable change. Sadly, I believe it's raising it's ugly head once again.",1494892800,,631,4.448275862068965
5889821,4,B00E44EZT0,"It was a good enough documentary.  That being said, the other reviews puzzled me until I realized that America doesn't teach it's history. It edits portions out to suit the governing bodies and majority citizenry. Stories such as these were etched into my brain growing up. The stories taught to us (black folk) included both white and black true life characters. Nothing overwhelming about this one.  Sorry all Americans don't know the full, true story of such an important era of our shared history....thus we are doomed to repeat it. I am now the protester. Shameful.",1494201600,,570,4.927083333333333

5889823,5,B00E44EZT0,This is a well-needed documentary. We don't need unsung heroes. They need to be out in the open to used as role models.,1486598400,,119,4.217391304347826
5889824,5,B00E44EZT0,"It was so worthwhile to learn about one of the lesser known heroes of the civil rights movement.  This was very enlightening.  We all have heard about the more famous civil war activists.  This serves as a eye opener reminding us that many extraordinary ""ordinary people"" had the courage and conviction to do more than just talk about the atrocities and injustices that were going on around them.  This should be shown in all US history classes.",1486339200,,445,4.740259740259741

5889826,5,B00E44EZT0,"Beautifully written story of one woman's conviction.  What a journey.  What a soul.  Brilliant interviews and footage of the Civil Rights Movement.  With absolutely respect for all her suffered and who were murdered.  Nothing sugar coated.  She is clear and if the audience member is listening there is information that is subtle and very real.  I couldn't help think this is a story that we all need to listen to right now in February 2017...when all that these ""Ordinary"" people fought with their lives for is at risk.  Thank you Loki Mulholland for asking your mother about her story and making this amazing film!",1486080000,,616,4.855769230769231

5889841,5,B00E44EZT0,"Very moving and uplifting.  SO grateful the filmmaker made this documentary.  Fascinating to hear this woman's first person account of some of the major events in the civil rights movement and those of her friends, and other leaders in the movement. It personalizes national events.  Will be recommending to friends and family, as well as nieces and nephews born long after this time because the documentary illuminates our country's history and struggles in such a down to earth human way.  Joan Trumpauer and her friends are an inspiration, and their commitment and courage to do the right thing as individuals are very relevant to us all today.

This documentary would also be interesting viewing for students in classrooms.",1481414400,3,727,5.127118644067797
5889842,5,B00E44EZT0,No one is ordinary and Joan is no exception.  What a powerful and needed message in these times that if we do not learn from history we are doomed to repeat it.  God celebrates those who step up bravely for those who cannot.,1480118400,,224,4.186046511627907
5889843,5,B00E44EZT0,I loved this film.  Our American education system does not teach real history and I learned more with this film than anything I learned in school. I loved Joan's courage to recognize wrong behavior and stand against a society that used God as an excuse to treat other people horribly.  She obviously understood what Christianity is really about when others were just using it as a label.,1479859200,,387,4.7611940298507465
5889844,4,B00E44EZT0,Very enjoyable story and heart warming.,1479254400,,39,5.666666666666667
5889845,5,B00E44EZT0,A very moving and interesting story. I am glad to have learned this story and I am also glad that Joan (the shero) decided to do what she did as she saw the injustices that were going on. I am also glad that she is a humble person who felt/feels that many others were and are perhaps more 'heroic' than she was/is.,1479254400,,314,4.080645161290323
5889846,5,B00E44EZT0,"Low key documentary, well-defined subject (not too broad, just how this one woman's life intersected with the Civil Rights movement.) I learned a few things and was reminded of a few things. Post 2016 election, reminds us of our duty to god and country.",1479254400,,253,4.7727272727272725
5889847,4,B00E44EZT0,"A great interview movie with some powerful moments as Civil Rights veterans reflect on the events of the 60s.  Altho Joan, the subject, is remembered as an exemplar of Gandhian nonviolence, her son, the filmmaker, manages to skip totally over her nonviolent philosophy and rationales for what she did, attributing it instead to humanitarian and justice motives.  Of course those were the original cause, but she could not do the things she did how she did them without nonviolence as a commitment.  For those of us who lived through those times, seeing the ugly side of the segregationists is a key reminder and should be an eye-opener for young people who think things were just Kumbaya moments while marching in the streets...",1478044800,,728,4.950819672131147
5889848,5,B00E44EZT0,"Really liked this documentary! There was good footage of the times, and it was laid out well. One got a sense of the extraordinary times that these ordinary heroes went through. A real contribution.",1477008000,,198,4.852941176470588

5889852,4,B00E44EZT0,"Having lived through the 60's, it was a reminder of all the struggles people had the courage to fight through for something we call freedom.  Over 40 years have passed and this generation has no idea of what blacks had to endure.",1475107200,,229,4.4523809523809526

5889895,5,B00E44EZT0,"I read plenty of books about ""black"" civil rights heroes, but had never heard about ""white"" ones. The most I had known was when I was in college researching the race riots in the 1970s, I came across a picture in the Times of two white men helping an elderly black man away from a white mob. That picture impressed me so profoundly. I was so glad to know that someone had done what was right and stood up for the cause of a society where all men are truly viewed as created equal. So I was excited to hear Joan's story.

For 4 years, a white southern girl (the ultimate supposed ""victim"" of black men) not only thought of blacks as equal, but joined their cause: demonstrated with them, faced down death with them, spent two years of jail time for them, went to an all black college with them, and mingled with some of their most influential leaders, including Dr. King.

The immigrant issue is our call to justice now, and we again need to stand on the side of love as demonstrated by Joan Trumphower more than fifty years ago.",1456876800,4,490,4.336956521739131

We should all make it a point to interview someone who is older about their life. I think we would be very surprised what we could find out. I am a nurse and once asked my elderly patient about his past and he told me he worked in the White House along side President Johnson as an adviser. This documentary details the involvement of the director's mother who was involved in the Civil Rights movement of the 50's and 60's. Who knew what this older southern woman gave up for her beliefs when she had it all to lose. Heroes come in all ages, shapes, sizes, and colors.",1454371200,4,747,4.194444444444445

Although today there is still some segregation in the US, it is nothing compared to how it is described in this documentary.
