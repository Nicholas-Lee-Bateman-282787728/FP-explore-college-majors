8693404,5,B00QZF5BWG,"5 Star for the movie.  2 Stars for the DVD.

About 20% of the top screen is cropped out so everyone's top of of head are cropped out from medium shot to close ups.  Original movie is 4:3 aspect.  But, it's cropped so that it fills up my 16:9 TV.  You can watch it in English or Italian.  Picture quality is a bit better than the video which you can watch on Youtube.

The story is a good one and very touching.  Kate Hepburn makes an excellent debut.",1486166400,,450,4.034090909090909
