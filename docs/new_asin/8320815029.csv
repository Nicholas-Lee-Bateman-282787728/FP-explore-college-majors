7901060,5,8320815029,"One of the last great works of the silent cinema, G.W. Pabst's PANDORA'S BOX was cruelly-ignored and dismissed by both audiences and critics upon it's original release in 1929. It wasn't until the George Eastman House revived the movie in the 1950s' that it finally started to receive it's full recognition--and resurrected it's luminous star Louise Brooks from an impoverished, destitute existence in New York in the process.

Based on two separate German plays written by Frank Wedekind (""Der Erdgeist"" and ""Die Bchse der Pandora""), Louise Brooks plays Lulu, a beautiful young dancer, full of life and vitality, and with a special talent in luring respectable men to ruin. Lulu is involved with an older newspaper magnate, Schn (Fritz Kortner), despite his engagement to another woman. Their affair blows wide open when his fiancee discovers them in a very compromising position; and Schn is forced to marry Lulu in order to avoid a scandal. On their wedding night, Schn tries to force Lulu to shoot herself, but in the ensuing struggle it's Schn who ends up dead, and Lulu is sentenced to five years in prison. Her friends create a distraction in the courtroom and Lulu flees the country with a ""borrowed"" passport. Accompanied by Schn's son Alwa (Franz Lederer), Lulu runs to London where her ultimate downfall is just around the corner...

Louise Brooks, with her shiny black bobbed hair and lithe dancer's body, was the ultimate 1920s jazz baby, a hoofer from the Midwest who never wanted to become a movie star, but unwittingly created one of the most haunting characters in movie history with Lulu in PANDORA'S BOX. Brooks made only a handful of movies (most of her early silents have sadly been lost forever), but we can be thankful PANDORA's BOX is still here, as vibrant and as vital as it was when first released back in '29.

PANDORA'S BOX is filled with lots of haunting imagery, the provocative storyline genuinely shocked audiences of the times (the film was heavily-edited following it's American debut). Perhaps most importantly, it preserves the heady atmosphere of pre-war Weimar Berlin, just a few short years before Hitler took power. According to sources, Pabst was just about to sign a young unknown called Marlene Dietrich until Brooks (in self-imposed exile from Hollywood) became available for the part.

If you're a fan of silent cinema, PANDORA'S BOX will be an essential title. If you want to begin exploring the slender catalogue of Louise Brooks films, it's a great place to start.
