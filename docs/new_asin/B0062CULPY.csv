4932181,1,B0062CULPY,Couldn't finish watching it was so bad. Very low budget film. The acting is very bad. The sound and lighting are also bad. Whoever filmed this didn't have much or any experience.,1485129600,,178,4.59375
4932182,2,B0062CULPY,"TERRIBLE acting, bad special effects and poor story line. not worth watching.",1485129600,,77,5.5
4932183,3,B0062CULPY,Pretty bad B movie acting and special effects are bad,1483315200,,53,4.4
4932184,5,B0062CULPY,Get story!,1425340800,,10,4.5
4932185,4,B0062CULPY,"This is a ""B"" movie with good 3D and not a bad story.  Acting is routine.",1407110400,3,73,3.5625
4932186,1,B0062CULPY,"I really don't want to write this review. I'm sure the folks who put this title together are nice folks who got friends and neighbors together and, with a handheld unsteady-cam 3-D camera had a ball making this on-the-fly picture. I might have been able to stand the makeshift storyboarding, but the parallax errors made it unviewable in 3-D. It gave me a very severe headache and nausea. I am a lover of 3-D and have been for over 60 years (I've shot 3-D myself), and I can take a considerable amount of distortion, but this was just too much. Maybe the 2-D version would be more fun--I always enjoy the hijinks when friends get together to make a movie.

Sorry, GMD Films. You really need to be careful about the technique with which you use the 3-D technology. Best of luck!",1383436800,4,777,4.471830985915493
4932187,2,B0062CULPY,"This film is slow and takes forever to get to where it is going, which isn't far.  A weird combination of yeti lore and genetics mixed together, the film will keep you wondering what it is really about.  So why two stars:  Angelina Leigh is worth seeing with her clothes off.  She does a credible job in a horrendous film.
You never have suspense....The film is shot badly and has a camcorder feel rather than a well shot film.  Rather than do 3D, they should have invested in a real camera and crew.
No sense of lighting, no sense of story structure.  Just amateur filmmaking at it's worst.",1353715200,2,591,4.425925925925926
8491097,1,B0062CULPY,"At the end of the credits, the truth comes out, ""Another stupid Maddy G production"". At least I know not to try any others. Wretched acting. Story that went from OK in the beginning, to WTF in the middle, to rotten towards the end, and to ""Why am I watching these loathsome degenerates - give me back my time"" at the end. Not one likable character in the mix.  I often like low budget indie flicks, but would definitely give this one 0 stars if the option existed.  Thank God I watched it on Prime so no actual money was sacrificed.",1500854400,,532,4.257425742574258
8491098,3,B0062CULPY,"Nothing to write home about - kind of gory, but not too bad of a movie.",1498089600,,71,3.5
8491099,5,B0062CULPY,"All of you posting negative comments really need to look at yourselves as closely as you think you looked at this film.  Are any of you out there doing what these folks are??  Obviously not as im not watching your movies.  Its an INDEPENDENT film, its not a million dollar film and to me that's a huge part of the charm of this movie. It is by all means worth watching and to me a very enjoyable film.  Say what you will, but everything other ""reviewers"" hated or disliked I loved.  Give it a chance before you pass judgment.",1487030400,2,525,4.262626262626263
8491100,2,B0062CULPY,"well it is a good attempt.. however it lacks, the cinematic polish of a good movie.. be forewarned, i only got to the 15 minute mark... sorry",1486944000,,141,4.2592592592592595
8491101,3,B0062CULPY,"Good story, good acting ... decent quality ... worth watching",1486598400,2,61,5.2
8491102,1,B0062CULPY,This is worst lousy actor and talk too much and less actor,1486598400,,58,3.9166666666666665
8491103,5,B0062CULPY,this film is based on a true story! quite a scary exp for a little boy to go through please watch this,1486166400,2,102,3.6818181818181817
8491104,1,B0062CULPY,stoped watching the first 5 min,1486166400,,31,4.333333333333333
8491105,1,B0062CULPY,"Started almost okay. Then it went way downhill. I'm guessing the main ""actress""'s money was involved because she look way too old for her age, based on the fact that one of the characters who would have been years older than her, looked younger. Very bad acting, not bad enough for ""it was so bad, it's good"". (As an example, Toxic Avenger, which was way better because it was so bad.) Definitely, for a big foot movie, which are 99% of the time lousy, this one was worse. Showing actresses in underwear or less does not any movie make better.",1485648000,,543,4.44
8491106,1,B0062CULPY,This was sooo!!! bad I had to keep watching it.  Such a low budget film and just plain cheesy.,1485302400,,94,3.9473684210526314
