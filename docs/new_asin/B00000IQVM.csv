1227714,5,B00000IQVM,"VIRUS is supposed to be a seatedge-puller, one of those sci-fi action flics, that make you throw up your popcorn with gory effects and make u bite your nails with suspense - well, VIRUS really delivers neither! The  story is kinda interesting though still stupid and trivial as hell - we've  seen extra terrestrial life forms adapt and combine humans with machines  before! The characters couldn't be more stereotype, the dialogues are  predictable, as is the whole plot of the movie. Still VIRUS has moments for  genre-fans and Jamie Lee Curtis is always worth a watch! Unfortunately  Donald Sutherland doesn't use his skills at all on this. The DVD version  also comes with some additional scenes that didn't make it in the  movie...well, guess, why not? They are superfluous because they just extend  less important story lines and prevent good pacing of the movie - a wise  move from the director...but these scenes don't justify the bying of VIRUS  - so final rating: Only for really straight and overall collecting horror  and sci-fi fans!!!",933292800,,1047,4.954022988505747
1227715,5,B00000IQVM,"I saw one and a half stars in the paper for this movie, but, seeing that Jamie Lee Curtis is AWESOME in horror flicks, I saw it in the theatre anyway.  Boy, were the critics off.  Nowhere in the movie did I see bad  acting.  The effects and suspense were awesome, and things were crashing  and popping out everywhere.  Curtis's performace was awesome.  I was on the  edge of my seat at times.  You won't be disappointed with this one kids!!!!",924048000,,442,4.3580246913580245

The crew of the Haggard tug board an abandoned Russian research ship and take on an alien life form, this life fold holds the ship hostage and feeds on electricity and thrives on developing new ways of killing the VIRUS known as man...

This is a great 90's action Sci-fi, very underrated movie with a top budget and brilliant special effects, all practical creature robot effects and good old school blood and gore, the cast is pretty decent its always good to watch a young Jamie lee Curtis, the movie is slow to start but is well paced with classic sci-fi action throughout and a cool music score to make things creepy, highly recommend going back to this one.

1227822,5,B00000IQVM,"Okay, since this film is sixteen years old (it's 2015 and this film came out in '99), I just wanted to give a shot at this film. I really enjoy certain sci-fi films like ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", ""E.T."" and ""The Thing."" Now, there's a lot to say about this one. I really enjoy the special effects, the cyborg effects and the storyline is pretty neat. Seeing Donald Sutherland and William Baldwin play in a film together with each other again was nicely done (two both starred in another film made by Universal, which was the 1991 film ""Backdraft"", released eight years earlier.) I didn't mind Jamie Lee Curtis' performance, she had the brains and the ability to bring her character into the story. The same goes for William and Donald. Generally, I'm not really a science fiction person, but this film is good and a good popcorn, candy, and soda thriller. If you enjoy films like this, you will not be disappointed!

1227860,2,B00000IQVM,"This movie offers a slightly different twist on something old.

 Donald Sutherland is very talented but he did horribly here. He was overacting and overdramatizing way too much and I HATED HIS CHARACTER. Sort of like Voight in Anaconda but worse. Jamie Lee Curtis was very good and she upped this otherwise so so movie a notch or two. William Baldwin (Steve), Julo Oscar Merchoso (Squeaky), Joanna Pacula (Nadia), Sherman Augustus (Ritchie), Cliff Curtis (Hiko) and Marshall Bell (Woods) are pulled their own weight and added dimensions of their own when needed. Baldwin and Curtis were the main stars here, besides Sutherland who played off to the side as a slimy creature. Take him out and we have A plus acting.

 The typical formula: A greedy SOB in charge; the second in command disagrees and has morals. The rest of the crew aren't crooked but the sight of dollar sides makes them sacrifice their beliefs for the greater good. Then hell breaks loose. They too quickly decide some dough in their pocket isn't worth the fight and then try to undo the disaster they have caused by getting on the vessel in the first place. Nadia's character was nothing more and nothing less than something added in to let the rest know what was going on. Without her they would have actually - *gasp* - had to figure it out for themselves. But since this movie wanted to get strait to the action they didn't want any of that discovery/mystery crap -- it was all told to them and in our faces upfront, and the action started almost immediately. Oh yeah, and of course Nadia isn't believed in time. (Not that you can really blame them on this point.)

 So all in all a pretty predictable movie. It even ended the way I figured it would. Thankfully there are some semi suspenseful moments to keep us awake. And the computer creatures are something out of a technology age nightmare. They are clever and fun to watch.

 The theme/threat is about the same as any threatening alien movie. Humans are expendible. Except instead of being used for food or simply bodies to inhabit, we're used for ""spare parts"".

 We don't find out how the virus came to be, only how it came upon the ship. Thankfully a movie can still work this way and we don't need the unknown mapped out for us.

 A watchable movie although the review may not sound like it; just don't expert art. Also you may not wish to shell out the bucks to own it. But it's an interesting experience to see at least once and end up having a decent enough time once the action really gets rolling. Also some of the deaths are pretty tragic and this helps all horror.",1379635200,,2602,4.548179871520342
1227861,5,B00000IQVM,"I've read the Jamie Lee Curtis considers this a pretty bad film - considering what I've seen nowadays, it's a lot better.  Not perfect, though very bizarre - the main reason I would watch it is because of her.",1379289600,,209,4.358974358974359
1227862,5,B00000IQVM,"When I saw virus again, I just loved the hell out of it, again! I really liked the mechanical workings of the robots. The Russian spoken in the movie was a turn-on for me, also. My second hobby is foreign languages. Pete",1377820800,,220,4.261904761904762

1227885,1,B00000IQVM,Terrible audio and no CC available as with most of Amazon Instant video. I quit after  less than 30 min. Seem like most of it was filmed in the dark (scenes). Just frustrating to not earring and difficulty viewing in the dark (inside a ship).,1372204800,,242,4.377777777777778
1227886,5,B00000IQVM,This is a good movie to kill some time.  See what happens when an alien computer virus tries to take over humanity by changing its victims into obedient cyborgs.  Has pretty cool visual effects for its time.,1367625600,,207,4.5675675675675675
1227887,1,B00000IQVM,"You know that a movie is pretty bad when its star later rants about just how awful it is.

And honestly, Jamie Lee Curtis describing how she uses ""Virus"" to compete in I've-been-in-worse-movies-than-you contests is a LOT more entertaining than the movie itself. Plot holes, characters acting like morons, a pace like the oozing of frozen mud -- it's difficult to find anything that is actually GOOD about this unmitigated, derivative mess.

The tugboat Sea Star ends up being swept into a massive typhoon, and ends up losing its cargo. I honestly don't even know if tugboats can go out to sea like that, or if they are used as cargo ships. I tend to think that the answer to both is ""no.""

 While alcoholic Captain Everton (Donald Sutherland) contemplates suicide, the rest of the crew notices another ship -- a seemingly abandoned Russian ship, just floating in the eye of the storm. Everton immediately becomes obsessed with claiming it as salvage, but navigator officer Kelly Foster (Jamie Lee Curtis) and engineer Steve Baker (William Baldwin) are wary.

The crew goes onto the Russian ship, and quickly discover that the electronics have been sabotaged. They only find out why when they are attacked by a half-crazed Russian survivor (Joanna Pacua) who demands that they cut all power to the ship. And before long, the dead-meat members of the crew stumble across an alien life-form that has taken over the ship -- a mechanical monster that uses humans for spare parts.

""Virus"" really feels like a bad Star Trek fanfic where the Borg crashed into 20th-century Earth. Yes, the alien intelligence is basically just a less intimidating clone of the Borg -- a biomechanical life-form that takes apart and puts together cyborg drones as a part of itself. It's not even subtle. The ""assimilated"" creatures even has attachments that are put there JUST to make them look Borglike.

And yet, the ripoffs are not the worst part of the movie. It just slogs by at a painfully slow pace, with predictable plot twists treated as surprises -- oh dear, will Everton betray them? I just need to know! In between are a lot of grotesquely dull scenes of bickering and people acting like idiots, not to mention horrendously slow action scenes of veeerrrry slooooowww cyborgs veerrry slooowwwly attacking the crew. And the more you think about it, the more plot hopes tear open -- for instance, why did Nadia not destroy the computer during the WEEK she was hiding on the ship? Was she just a massive coward?

And the crew makes stupid decision after stupid decision so that they'll be in the maximum amount of danger. In fact, it's pretty baffling that ANY of them are still obeying Everton when he is clearly insane, and they have PROOF of that because of how he took them straight into a typhoon.

Donald Sutherland and Jamie Lee Curtis are the only actors who have anything to do here, and they look disgusted -- I wouldn't be surprised if Sutherland really WAS drunk the whole time, and Curtis looks like she's about to leap overboard in every scene just to get away from this movie. And except for the hammy Baldwin, every other actor basically has ""dead meat"" written across their faces.

""Virus"" is a lot like a stomach virus -- it makes you dizzy and nauseous, and it seems to last forever. But when it's over, thank God and reach for a GOOD movie.",1367020800,,3342,4.72680412371134

 Donald Sutherland is great as a frustratingly idiotic tug captain.  His demise is one of the more satisfying of any dozen sci-fi, horror flicks.
  The effects work most of the time with the exception of the first few minutes while toy boats bounce around in the ""typhoon"".

1227912,3,B00000IQVM,Big Jamie Lee fan and she didn't disappoint. The storyline is creepy...machines thinking on their own using humans for parts.,1359244800,,125,5.3
1227913,4,B00000IQVM,"The plot is strictly by the book; you can practically check off the list of elements required to make a standard Sci-Fi flick about an alien force that inhabits computers and machines.  (Like that hasn't been done before!)
As if the script wasn't already top heavy with too many worse case scenarios: typhoon Leiah, sinking boat, BIG wave, BIG barge, BIG trouble, lots of yelling, a gun-toting captain (argh!), bye-bye barge.  ""May day!""
Also, the cast of stock characters definitely wasn't helped by the actors who embodied them.  Donald Sutherland specializes in playing this one lunatic; if you've seen him do it once, you've seen him do it a thousand times.  It's a lazy performance.  As for the other ""star"" in this movie, Jamie Lee Curtis has never been accused of having range or depth.  Here, she plays one of the boys (when she isn't flaunting her chest).  She goes from overly macho to a quivering whimpering mess during the course of the movie.  It's an odd transmigration to say the least.  As for the rest of the actors, they more or less get the job done and that's about it.  No one really stands out in a good way.
So now comes the hard part, explaining why I like this movie in spite of all its flaws (or maybe because of them?).  The truth is, I've never quite figured out why except that I feel compelled, every few years or so, to haul out this movie and watch it once again.

So due to this lightning some alien life form is aboard the ship and is creating some mech warriors that go after the members of the crew, all this while the Russian ship rides back into the typhoon.

1227942,1,B00000IQVM,"Virus (John Bruno, 1999)

Jamie Lee Curtis, one of the stars of John Bruno's only feature film, is on record as saying that Virus is ""the all time piece of s**t"", and she's right. And yet ten years later, in a Hollywood culture where the comic book adaptation has become a multi-billion-dollar niche, you kind of have to go back and see it; these are the hardscrabble beginnings that would eventually birth such blockbusters as Watchmen and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man franchise. That makes the movie itself, which comes off as a silly pastiche of slightly less mediocre movies, no less awful, but it does have its place in film history.

Curtis plays Kit Foster, part of the crew of a tugboat that's out on the seas trying to make a living. When things go disastrously wrong during a storm, they encounter a Russian ship that seems to be abandoned. Captain Everton (Donald Sutherland, sporting the worst Irish accent in film history)'s greedy eyes light up at the possibility of a salvage run that will net the crew more money than it cost to make this film, and the crew scramble aboard--Everton, Kit, Steve (William Baldwin), the wonderfully-tattooed Hiko (Sunshine's Cliff Curtis), J. W. (The Astronaut Farmer's Marshall Bell), Richie (Thr3e's Sherman Augustus), and Squeaky (Planet Terror's Julio Oscar Mechoso). All well and good until they discover that someone else is on the ship, and that someone else has scuttled their tugboat, leaving them adrift in a dead ship in the open sea not only with that person, but with something far more dangerous. You get the idea that said something probably has to do with the opening scene, in which the Russians are monitoring a spacecraft that gets hit by some sort of weird extraterrestrial storm.

The reason John Bruno has never directed another feature film (he did a bit of the T2 footage for the amusement park ride, and two episodes of Star Trek: Voyager before going back to the world of visual effects; he most recently worked on James Cameron's blockbuster Avatar) is likely because this one is so badly botched. Put aside Sutherland's silly accent and the worst acting ever delivered by any member of this cast. Ignore the incredible silliness of many bits of Chuck Pfarrer's screenplay, adapted from his own comic series. Just look at it from a technical perspective. David Eggby, who can be such an artist when he wants to be (he did the camerawork on Mad Max and Pitch Black), seems to have shot the whole thing through some sort of weird blue filter. Maybe he was going for bleakness? No, he did that very well in some other films. The music (by Joel McNeely, who scored Holes rather well) is sometimes clever, but too often gets in the way. The editing is credited to an actual, live human being (M. Scott Smith, who also did The Crow), but it looks suspiciously as if the film was thrown into a blender to cut, and then reassembled by a blind ten-year-old. How did so many otherwise talented people make such a bad movie? I don't have an answer to this, and if you value your sanity, you should avoid trying to come up with one as well. *",1268697600,,3098,4.680733944954128

VIRUS is a combination of themes from different science fiction genre.  At times it resembles ALIENS, Star Trek: the Borg Collective, Terminator, Time Machine and Moby Dick.

Donald Sutherland does an excellent job as the Captain Everton of the Sea Star who is more motivated by his greed than his fear of the unknown.  He had fun with this role.

Jamie Lee Curtis is in fine form as Kit Foster, a former navy brat, daughter of an Admiral, who becomes the human heroine against the technology of dominance. Her character never seemed happy in this role-single female on a boat of nine males.  She never had any joy.

Joanna Pacula is the noble Russian Science Officer, Nadia, who witnessed the take over of her ship by an entity which feeds on electrical energy. Nadia confronts her fear and makes a heroic stand against the evolving alien menace.

The other players in this drama do a descent job, especially Sherman Augustus as Richie and Cliff Curtis as Hiko. Both Richie and Hiko meet their destiny by their unselfish bravery for their crew mates.

The Russian ship, Akedemic Valdislav Volkov, must have been a destroyer during the Cold War.  Adding labs and satellite dishes made it a scientific research vessel still with its armory and a crew of 300.

The special effects are very good for 1999 vintage.  The story is a theme which has been repeated over the decades-human kind against the machine.

For the alien entity to classify the human race as a virus was a good twist.  From hence the name of the film is derived.

It will not go down in the annals of the best of the science fiction films of the 90's, but it is worth the time to watch.  There is a message here lost in the special effects and action sequences.",1232323200,,1739,4.5792880258899675

So danger had to come from the sky, hence from the cosmos, hence some immaterial living form, at least immaterial according to our definition of matter. They just take over any kind of communications network and have at their disposal the whole sum of human knowledge, plus theirs, and they start spreading. They take over a Russian scientific boat and then recuperate anything, computer parts, mechanical parts and human parts, to build some hybrid beings that can take the control of the ship and then go to some human harbor and invade the planet. But it all goes wrong when some real human beings decide to use their intelligence and training to destroy these hybrid beings, the extraterrestrial cosmic being behind and sink the boat. And we are really after the end of the Cold War since it is the last female Russian survivor who will sacrifice herself to slow down the main ""machine"" so that the two last Americans will be able to escape while her sacrifice will start the setting on fire of the ship and the blowing of it up and down into the sea. A little bit simple, though quite entertaining if you like that kind of paranoid science fiction: the human species is always menaced, from inside or from outside, and it is always thanks to the sacrifice of some who use their intelligence and know how in a creative way that the planet and humanity are saved. Paranoid and nave. And the final couple that escape the ship is of course a man and a woman. Adam and Eve not dead yet.

Virus is one such movie, reminiscent of films such as The Thing, Leviathan and Deep Rising.

A crew of Sea Star has survived a terrible storm and while swimming thought it's peaceful eye, they stumble upon a seemingly abandoned Russian research center with it's power totally turned off. They can't find one body on the huge ship and as they turn the power back on strange things begin to happen. They appear to be in the belly of a beast, in the middle of an attack form outer space, which electrocuted the Mir and send a screaming signal back into the ship. As the crew starts to look through the ship, an anchor from the research boat drops itself into their tugboat, leaving them stranded on the ghost ship. They have no other choice but to steer it to  land and try to salvage it. When they try to control the ship they find that all the electronic equipment seems to be working against them. When some of the crew go missing, and more accidents keep happening, they discover a sole survivor who has hidden in a lab for over a week and who warns them to turn the power off. She says that the attacked Mir transmitted a computer signal that took control over the ship, it learned all there was about humans form the central computer system and turned all the electronics, the robots and even rewired itself to form  Terminator like creatures that killed of any remaining crew. Other than running away from crawling creatures, all mechanic and with destruction in mind, the crew starts to fight against each other. I found that a few of the characters grew in greatness, they performed self sacrifices to give a few spare minutes for their fellow colleagues and others turned to the evil side, with their own survival in mind. The ending was a real build up while the secrets of what went on were revealed, with the surviving crew growing smaller and their battle for survival getting harder and harder.

I'm not sure why this movie was so badly received, I found myself thoroughly enjoying this surreal story. The chases, the cramped quarters, the ships hallways and rooms reminded me of those of a space ship, with only so many exits and the movie kept my attention the entire time until the credits rolled. I rated this based on how much I enjoyed it, and yes this is not serious drama, if I wanted to watch one I would be watching Hamlet, but I chose to veg out on the couch with some food and drinks and my boyfriend to pass the lazy afternoon in front of the TV while immensely enjoying this movie.

  Originally I saw Virus on Showtime in the 80's it ran 2 hours 10 minutes and wasn't bad even though as I understand it an hour of Japanese scenes and dialog had been removed.. The special effects were TV quality but the storyline was good. I have been telling friends about it for years and they wanted to see it. I've searched for the original version but I  only found it on Japanese websites at a cost of over $60 US. (At that exchange rate no wonder the Japanese take month long golfing vacations in Hawaii).

  When the order arrived after 3 weeks and not the 10 days advertised by Amazon, my wife and I planned on watching Virus that night. What a disappointment. The picture was so dark that we had to crank up the brightness and picture quality on our 32 inch JVC to the maximum setting. I knew that there would be a major reduction in quality when compressing 6 hours onto a 4.7 GB DVD but it was degraded further because The transfer was done from a well worn print or overplayed tape.

  To our further disappointment many of the more poignant scenes had been deleted. Gone were the Tokyo hospital scenes where only four nurses were left to care for the thousands of dead or dying. Gone was the scene where the Japanese Antarctic station made radio contact with a young American boy who was the only survivor in his town. All gone because the film had been cut to 107 minutes!.

Rated R for sci-fi violence/gore, and for language.

On the American tugboat, the Sea Star, Kit Foster (Jamie Lee Curtis), Steve Baker (William Baldwin), and Captain Robert Everton (Donald Sutherland), along with several other crew members are lost at sea. While trying to sail through against raging storms and aggressive tidal waves, the crew has unfortunately lost the required cargo. They are lost for hope until the crew members of the Sea Star spot the Academic Vladislav Volkov, a vessel lying alone in the seam floating still in apparent tranquility, floating in the middle of the ocean with no signs of survivors aboard.  Despite the permeating silence throughout the vessel, the Sea Star crew refuses to give up. They climb aboard the vessel hoping to find any insinuating signs of life. These people learn only too soon that they are not alone on this Volkov ship, for an unknown alien presence has traveled in the shape of an amorphous cosmic beam into a Russian Space Station. Unbeknownst to the Sea Star crew, the alien has taken over the entire ship and now it is hiding somewhere in this very vessel and spreading throughout the ship. The Sea Star crew must fight against this violent new species and their struggle becomes the ultimate battle between the human race and the alien virus.

Although it has some hokey moments, this big-budget sci-fi action thriller had a lot going for it; the where-is-everybody setting and premise is engrossing, the cast give their characters more credibility than the script sometimes deserves, the robotic special effects by Chuck Gaspar are eye-popping and David Eggby's dark photography slams along fast enough to leave you gasping. Chuck Pfarrer's script (based on his comic-book) has a good central idea - an electrical life-form comes into contact with a space-station, which unwittingly transmits it into the computer of the ship, from where it starts to use the people and equipment on board to build itself a physical existence. Where the script starts to break down for me is when the characters start losing it and acting like clowns, and the sheer vagueness of the alien's power (it can weld doors shut remotely on the ship, but wastes all its time building big-ass robots to chase the heroes down narrow gangways). The likable cast gamely throw themselves around the nightmarish sets, but ""Virus"" is not exciting, intelligent, or scary enough to sustain the audience's attention.  Sutherland is ridiculously outlandish and Jamie Lee Curtis admittingly regrets her role and performance in the film. A little derivative of producer Gale Ann Hurd and effects man Bruno's earlier movies (notably ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" and ""The Abyss""); ""Virus"" is a ""shoulda-coulda been"" mistake that didn't live up to its billing.",1135814400,,2975,5.140786749482402

Virus does have significant similarities with the movie Ghost Ship, only instead of an Italian cruise ship it is a Russian science/research vessel and instead of ghosts it's a hostile alien life force.

Jamie Lee Curtis, Donald Sutherland, William Baldwin, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well.

The only major setback is in relation to some unnecessary and unintelligent dialogue in referring to the Russian alphabet as ""Cyrillic crap"" and ""chicken scratch.""  Coming from some ignorant writer to refer to Cyrillic letters in such a way (which are based on the Greek alphabet) is just sad, especially when one considers the fact that they have been in use for more than a thousand years (Russian) and more than three and half thousand years respectively (Greek).  The blame lies on the writer/s, but also on those who supposedly proofread the lines.

This is the third time I have watched it and have still enjoyed it - Just think there is always someone smarter than you out there.  Weird life form.

Generally liked the characters - especially our bomb expert.

I have no problem following the theory that there has to be a total anihilation of this life form.  The struggle to do so is still a tribute to man's triumph over his fears of the unknown.

Then we have man's ingenuity against machine's capabilities.  And a definite scenerio of how man's greed is his own destruction.  Oh yes, a tribute to man's compassion and partnership where it counts.

But boy oh boy, when you get to number 3 (Deadly Harvest) you realize that the impossible has been made manifest! It is also stunningly awful!

In short (the films aren't worth more than that), the productions are cheap and sleazy, the actors are off their feed (if indeed, they'd eaten from the apple of talent at all), the settings are lousy, most of the footage is stock footage, and some shots are even repeated. The scores match all of this in quality.

All three films are television quality, both in script and in picture.  The best of these three by far is ""Virus"" (1980 starring Chuck Connors and George Kennedy) AKA ""Day of Ressurrection"" or ""Fukkatsu No Hi"" in Japan.  The other two films are ""Deadly Harvest"" about a world food shortage due to the disintegration of the ozone layer or something, anyway it's really quite a bore.  The film is set in the late '70's on a farm where a family has to protect their food from ""city folk"" who keep trying to steal it.  Then there's ""Hurricane"" of 1974 starring Larry Hagman.  This film was okay, the quality is pretty bad and the story and acting is VERY campy.  There is a lot of hurricane stock footage from the 1960's-70's in it as well.  ""Virus"" is also presented pretty poorly and this edition features the American TV version of the film that is short nearly an hour of footage, but it's still a pretty interesting film without it.

1228041,3,B00000IQVM,"In an interview with one of the celebrity magazines, Jamie Lee Curtis listed two films she wished she had never made: ""Grandview, USA,"" and 1999's ""Virus."" The two movies couldn't stand further apart in subject matter-""Grandview, USA"" is one of those treacly coming of age films that appear on the scene every year or so. ""Virus,"" on the other hand, is a huge budget science fiction film designed to bring in millions from audiences who favor bombastic effects over character development, logical continuity, and an intelligent script. While I think Curtis's statements about ""Virus"" a tad extreme, the movie surprisingly tanked at the box office despite its heavy reliance on shock and awe production values. When I recently viewed the movie on DVD, I more or less enjoyed the film. I did, however, come to understand why it ultimately failed at the box office. Curtis shouldn't fear any lasting damage to her career from ""Virus,"" however. With her cult status from the ""Halloween"" franchise and her increasing forays into family comedy (""House Arrest,"" ""Freaky Friday""), she should continue to rake in the bucks well into the future.
""Virus"" begins with an eerie disaster. An amorphous, glowing cloud-like object from outer space invades the Mir space station just as the satellite's crew is about to transmit important information to a Russian ship on the ocean. The object, whatever it is, manages to send itself down to earth and directly into the boat's computer system through this transmission link. The ship's electronics go instantly haywire, with people screaming and running all over the place. Fast forward a few days to another boat on the high seas, this one a barge transporting merchandise through a storm. Helmed by a grizzly old tar named Captain Robert Everton (Donald Sutherland) and manned by a crew including Kit Foster (Jamie Lee Curtis) and Steve Baker (William Baldwin), the boat flounders in the rough waters and loses its cargo. Everton isn't popular with his crew; his steadfast refusal to cut the barges loose almost caused the entire boat to sink. It turns out Everton's entire life savings was bound up in that cargo, a fact that causes him immense distress until someone spots an abandoned boat a few miles ahead. Filled with sudden optimism over a lucrative recovery fee, Everton and his crew board the vessel. And wouldn't you know it? It's the Russian research craft we saw at the beginning of the movie.
The ship is in sorry shape, drifting in the ocean with no crewmembers and no power. Still, Everton recognizes the value of his find and figures the finder's fee should be worth millions. As long as no one on the boat is alive, the captain and his crew should collect the money. In the meantime, they have to turn the power back on and sail the ship into harbor. The trouble begins at this point. An unfortunate ""accident"" sends the research vessel's anchor plunging through Everton's boat. Now trapped on the Russian ship, the crew of the cargo boat discovers troubling evidence of a decidedly sinister series of events. The sole survivor of the disaster, a research scientist named Nadia (Joanna Pacula), tells Everton and company about an alien life form that took over the ship's power grid, a creature that used parts of the boat to build killer robots to wipe out the Russians. Since the first thing Everton did when he got on the boat is turn the power back on, the alien is once again on the loose. The organism tells the humans that it wants to wipe out all the people on earth because it considers them a virus. Neat. In the meantime, cloud creature consoles itself with turning Everton's crew into gruesome looking cyborgs. ""Virus"" turns into an extended chase scene through the bowels of the Russian ship as Curtis, Baldwin, and the dwindling others attempt to destroy the life form.
""Virus"" is a predictable, by the numbers science fiction film. While the special effects work looks good (not great, unfortunately), and there is a bit of gore to liven things up, the character development falls flat. Sutherland slums his way through his role as the scheming Everton. Curtis tries hard but ultimately fails to muster much interest in her tough woman role. William Baldwin is, well, William Baldwin. If you went into this one looking forward to a great performance from him, you deserve the disappointment you will inevitably find. The rest of the cast serves as cannon fodder. This isn't to say I despised ""Virus."" There are a few things of interest if one looks hard enough. For example, I roared so hard with laughter over Sutherland's metamorphosis into a cyborg that I hurt myself. Everton tried to make a deal with the alien but quickly fell prey to its murderous designs. When we next see him, he's been turned into some hideous half machine, half human monstrosity, but he still has his captain's cap parked (and at a jaunty angle, too) on top of his head! Too funny! Why does he still have that hat on? Maybe the script thought the audience would fail to recognize him.
""Virus"" tends more to the ridiculous than anything else, but it's not a lost cause. As long as you go into the film expecting to see a formulaic plot, you'll probably enjoy most of it. Supposedly, the DVD version has a ton of extras, but the disc I watched didn't have any on it except a trailer for the film. Would I watch ""Virus"" again? Probably, if it showed up on cable and I had two hours to kill. I wouldn't, however, buy it or rent it again. If you want great science fiction, rent ""Aliens,"" ""The Terminator,"" or a dozen other memorable movies. If you're just looking to slum for awhile, watch ""Virus.""",1082592000,3,5640,4.779713114754099

1228043,4,B00000IQVM,"I put off watching Virus for some time because of the general sense of mediocrity it seemed to generate in many viewers and, more importantly, the fact that it features not only Jamie Lee Curtis, who is not my favorite actress, but also a Baldwin brother (William).  After watching it, though, I have to say that Virus is really not a bad movie at all.  Certainly, there is a lot of Alien-type stuff going on, but there is plenty of action, a fair smidgeon of gore, and reason to hope that maybe, just this once, a Baldwin character might not survive to the end.  Sherman ""Is that Cuba Gooding, Jr.?"" Augustus and Marshall Bell deserve a lot of credit for injecting some comedy and realism into this movie, but it is Joanna Pacula, in the role of Russian science officer Nadia Vinogradiya, who really steals the show, in my opinion.  She certainly far outshines Jamie Lee Curtis, whose character has almost no depth whatsoever.
The trouble starts on Mir, as some sort of fast-moving cloud of energy takes over the space station and gets sent along for the ride down to a Russian scientific receiving vessel somewhere in the Pacific, where it puts on a light show to beat the band.  Days later, a salvage boat led by the hopelessly annoying Captain Everton (Donald Sutherland in one of his lesser performances) tries to drag a barge through a hurricane; the boat makes it to the eye of the storm, where it discovers a large Russian ship dead in the water.  The crews board the Russian vessel, finding no signs of the crew, and eyes start to widen at the thought of the money to be earned for salvaging this gigantic scientific ship.  After they turn the power back on, they come to discover two life forms stowed away onboard, however.  One of them is the ship's science officer Nadia Vinogradiya; the other is something not of this world.  This alien life force needs electricity to function, and once the ship is powered back up it gets to work building all kinds of little robots who in turn build bigger robots, all of which work to destroy all humans on the vessel; in a nice little twist, man has become the virus to be eliminated.  You can imagine what ensues.  The humans fight to survive, giving the increasingly powerful alien life force a pretty good fight, even after their numbers start to dwindle and familiar faces in the form of Borg-like creatures turn their sights on the human intruders.  I didn't care much for the ending, especially since all the wrong characters survived, but one British captain of another vessel delivers a classic six-line comment that did much to better my mood.
Virus is by no means a classic, but the film does deliver a suspenseful, pyrotechnic-laced good time.  Jamie Lee Curtis in particular is put through the wringer, while Joanna Pacula is just terrific.  I'm really not sure why many people hold this film in such low regard, as I found it both interesting and enjoyable.

However, Virus does have it's good points: Donald Sutherland hams it up so much you can't help but chuckle, plus the special effects are nicely put together and the gore effects are great as well.  It seems ever since Aliens was such a hit way back when, a host of other very similar films have tried to copy that film's style and have fallen flat on their face.

I cannot really ''praise,'' per se, the originality or story of the film ''Virus,'' because, in all honesty, it's not what anyone can rightly call a great film. Sure, it's visually stunning and fun and enjoyable and all that... but it's certainly not ''Terminator'' or ''Aliens.''
Even so, I'm somewhat puzzled that so many reviewers are having a difficult time ''relating'' to this movie, based upon how it plays itself out. I think they are missing one key element in the whole thing, however:
Just as ADULT reviewers have to be reminded that ''Santa Claus Conquers the Martians'' was a movie made for the tiny tot audience, reviewers of the movie ''Virus'' need to keep in mind that this film was based on a ''comic book'' story (...or as ''fanboys''-- current and former --would call it, a ''graphic novel'')!
Anyone who pays any amount of attention would realize that there is NEVER (or rarely ever) going to be a ''totally straight'' presentation of a comic book story translated to the big screen -- even if the story itself is treated ''seriously'' within the pages of the comic. (''The Crow'' was one of those rarest of exceptions.)
Keeping that in mind may actually make viewing this movie about an alien energy lifeform that....??? uses human bodies for ''spare parts'' ???...., and tries to kill them off more effectively by constructing cybernetic monstrosities???.... okay, so it's a little ludicrous, but again, I don't think it was meant to be taken completely seriously -- it's mindless escapism that's both fun and scary. That's Entertainment!

1228046,2,B00000IQVM,"... When I first saw the previews for this, I assumed it took place in space on board a ship taken over by an alien. Even the video box looks space bound. Wrong.
A boat crew loses their cargo in a typhoon (which do not necessarily spring up out of nowhere anymore, having lived through dozens of them in the Far East) and comes across a seemingly abandoned Russian space communications ship while waiting in the storm's eye. The Russian ship could be salvaged, and the crew decides to take it and redeem the millions of dollars they think they will get. Suddenly, a Russian scientist appears and tells them what happened. Apparently, and this was shown in the beginning of the movie, an alien lifeforce took over the Mir space station, then the ship in the water. It is electronic in nature, and uses humans for ""spare parts"" as it builds machine/human hybrids to do its bidding. A lot of things blow up after that, all headed toward the predictable finale.
Jamie Lee Curtis is the navigator, but is not given a lot to do except cough and call out other characters' names in dark corridors. One of the Baldwin brothers comes along for the ride. It's not Alec, and not that [one] from ""Bio Dome,"" it is the middle one, I think. Donald Sutherland is the stereotypical mentally unbalanced captain of the American ship. He has some kind of strange accent that sounds Scottish one minute, and Canadian the next. The rest of the doomed crew consists of expendable minority characters and ... crusty cowards. Why is it only the white women survive movies like this? Joanna Pacula plays the surviving Russian scientist. She has done better.
The entire film is full of characters wandering down dark hallways, and ""checking on"" each other. People get separated, and the real gore comes about thanks to the machines.
The special effects are pretty incredible. From the opening space shots, to the typhoon effects, to the very gory hybrids, I thought they were the best thing about the film.
The cast here tries hard. The film looks expensive, and Bruno's direction is excellent. The musical score is a little clangy, and the cinematography (especially a closing sunrise shot) is lush.
There is just nothing underneath the surface of this film. Characters go tromping after noises they hear in the dark. The crew stumbles across a stash of guns that seems prerequisite in all sci-fi horror films. Jamie Lee Curtis is lusted after by the rest of the crew as she remains serious so she can be taken seriously. They even throw in a fake ending to get your blood rushing again after 100 minutes of yelling, gore, and explosions. ... .
What we have here is a spaceship movie that takes place in the ocean going ship concerning a computer virus ... . What we also have here is a lot of cliche dressed up with pretty pictures, an expensive look, and great effects. This is very similar to the straight to video ""Proteus."" We also have a film I cannot recommend.

1228078,2,B00000IQVM,"Virus was an ill-fated title for many Universal Studio executives. Budgeted at $75,000,000, it was the last straw in a string of flops. Shortly after it was released, heads rolled. I can see why, as will you, if you see the video.
For one thing, successful horror movies have been set in many places - big cities [The Exorcist, The Omen], small towns [Halloween, Carrie], and even in outer space [Alien, Aliens]. Jaws, the biggest of them all, took place by and under an ocean, but every other one I can think of that was set at sea promptly capsized and sank. Virus is no exception. This is regrettable, because, as my regular readers know, horror movies are one of my guilty pleasures.
The movie begins in fine fashion. A Russian ship on a science mission is in contact with astronauts in the Mir space station. A transmission is about to be sent from the station to the ship. Suddenly an astronaut spies a beautiful purple cloud approaching. Just as the transmission begins, the cloud hits the station. Huge bolts of electricity surge through the station, which sends them down to the ship. Things explode, debris flies, crew members scream. Fadeout.
What comes next brings the movie down to earth. We see a crew being tossed about in a tugboat in the middle of a typhoon. This dinky little ship is in the Pacific Ocean towing a barge about a hundred times its size. As it turns out, whatever the barge is carrying belongs to greedy Captain Everton [Donald Sutherland], who threatens to kill any crew member who does the sensible thing, which is to release the barge. When the crew, which includes Kit [Jamie Lee Curtis] and Steve [William Baldwin], finally wins out, the barge promptly sinks. Everton is beside himself with grief. The storm intensifies. Then Kit has a bright idea - hey, gang! Let's sail over to the eye of the storm! There they encounter that Russian ship, which is sitting dead in the water. Everton has a thought - Let's board it and claim salvage rights!
What follows is a fairly decent tale of an entity which takes up residence in machinery and computers. It's mission is, of course, to destroy the human race. It creates some cool monsters and thinks the only thing people are good for is as spare parts. The problem for both the entity and us is those idiots from the tugboat. They are so cartoonish and predictable that we wind up not really caring who wins the battle.
Jamie Lee Curtis, who proved, especially in True Lies and A Fish Called Wanda, that she is a fine actress, has turned around and returned to her horror movie roots. Donald Sutherland, once a great leading man, has lately taken some roles that would be beneath even his son, Keifer. William Baldwin is also not doing his career a favor. What we have may be three stars in search of new agents.
This brings us back to those horror movies which succeeded. Regardless of where they were set, each had in common well defined characters that we cared about. Was there ever a better woman as hero than Sigourney Weaver in Alien? Didn't we root for Sissy Spacek in Carrie? Wasn't it dreadful when Lee Remick fell off the stair landing in The Omen? In movies like Virus, there is simple nothing about the characters to make us care what happens to them.",1016755200,,3244,4.594827586206897
1228079,4,B00000IQVM,"In the early 1980's, New Line Cinema released a low-budget horror film named ""Deathship,"" in which a handful of shipwreck survivors board a mysterious vessel in search of assistance and shelter. Of course, things go wrong for the characters as well as the ludicrous, unaffecting plot, which carried no shocks, no scares, and no suspense (and you wonder why you've never heard of it until now).
In effect, John Bruno's ""Virus"" is the movie that ""Deathship"" wanted to be, possessing a somewhat similar story structure that is predictable, corny, and uses just about every piece of science fiction dialogue known to man. But familiar can be fun, and for the most part, this schlocky thriller has some vibrant kick to it.
It begins by introducing us to the inevitable problematic situation: a Russian vessel commandeered for scientific research and medical experimentation receives a satellite transmission, in which a strand of alien life form is embedded that begins taking over their computer and power systems. Elsewhere in the Pacific, a small tugboat is battling its way through a typhoon. Its captain, Robert Everton (Donald Sutherland), presses on into the storm, despite cautionary warnings from navigator Kit Foster (Jamie Lee Curtis), who urges him to head for the storm's eye.
A lost cargo barge and sufficient structural damage finally convince Everton to head for calm seas; once in the eye, Foster picks up a signal from another vessel, the same Russian vessel (gasp!) we saw in a state of disarray in the opening sequence. After boarding the abandoned ship, they find a variety of mysterious occurrences, from bullet holes in walls and windows, to a complete absence of power to the ship's engines and computers.
A good setup so far, so it may come as a letdown that the antagonist of the story turns out to be a wave of computer-engineered robots, ranging from the smaller ""gatherers"" to the monstrous half-machine, half human contraptions fitted with things like machine guns, drills, clamps, all of which are controlled by a main computer who sounds like Arnold Schwarzenegger after too many martinis. As you may have guessed, the plot turns to race-for-survival tactics, pitting humans against human killing machines as they try to find a way off the vessel and a method of destroying the alien life form.
As with any clich-riddled science fiction thrill machine, there are pitfalls. The plot relies heavily on familiar twists and shocks that are seen coming a mile away. There are the obvious ""Is It Really Dead?"" jump scenes, during which a supposedly dead robot suddenly jolts to a quick hit on the soundtrack, as well as the standard ""You're All Going to Die"" speech, in which the secret behind the alien infestation is revealed, as well as its plan for humanity. The movie also makes it painfully clear who is going to survive the requisite final explosion, in which all the problems are solved.
But, despite its banality, the film benefits from a likeable cast including Scream Queen Curtis and Donald Sutherland, whose cocky, arrogant demeanor is full of gusto and great zeal. William Baldwin plays opposite Curtis as the required ""Love Beneath the Surface"" character, Steve Baker; the fact that his role doesn't require much of his talent is a plus. The special effects, created by the wizards behind ""Jurassic Park,"" are cheesy but effectively eye-popping, while the movie moves at a fast pace, making up for its lack of fresh ideas. Unlike an actual disease, ""Virus"" is too superficial and unoriginal to remain with you for long, but while you're there, it's quite a ride.",1015718400,,3598,4.998333333333333

In the beginning we get to know him as a ruthless guy that would sacrifice his crew and even his life for a doubtfull cargo, then he's tempted to kill the only russian survivor to get his thirteen million Dollars of salvage for the ship. And at last he is selling himself to the extraterrestrials for the same thiteen million reasons mentioned above.
Curtis isn't giving an extraordinary performance. This Role could have been played by a dozend of other actresses. But in my oppinion this means that the role is badly written.
Baldwin...well he's there and I'm sure he was payed in the end...
The robots and the borg-like creatures on the other hand look pretty amazing and the action is pretty fast and furious at times. The special effects deserve at least 4 stars, but the acting and the story decreases this rating.

In the beginning you want to think he's a grizzled Cappy, then you realize he's a suicidal drunk, then you see he will kill innocents for money, then you see him sell his soul to the alien force which has taken over the ship for no other apparent reason other than raking in 13 million $ which anyone can see is impossible.. and his acting is downright poor.

1228085,2,B00000IQVM,"Missing this film when it opened theatrically (it seems it disappeared after a few days at the box office), I was anxious to see if since (1) I am a big sci-fi buff, and (2) much of it was filmed where I formerly lived (coastal Virginia). I finally bought the DVD, and boy, was I disappointed!  Other reviewer's criticisms are right on the mark.  Deriviative? Sure, but that can be forgiven; after all, many sci-fi and horror films do owe much to previous works.  Technically impressive?  No question it looks great, and the Dolby Digital surround effects are superb(thus the two stars).  That's the good news.  The bad news is that this is among the most lame, unexciting snoozers to come down the pike in a while. Jamie Lee Curtis maintains her trademark horror-sticken visage, Donald Sutherland's acting is of high-school production level, and the rest of the cast is largely forgettable, although they do flesh out the typical stereotypes usually found in such films. Even Jamie Lee's ""tight purple sweater"" cannot save this turkey. Insomniacs would do well to play this back-to-back with the equally dreadful 'Sphere'.

If the Sight of Jamie Lee Curtis, Donald Sutherland and William Baldwin Acting like they are 8 year olds playing ""Tag"" on a Big Boat sounds appealing to you, (it did to me) you'll have a Good Old time with this Mindless Monster movie.
The Acting is Quite Robotic. Jamie Lee is set on ""Gasp"". William is set on ""Cardboard Hero"" and Donald on ""Overact"". The rest of the cast don't bother with Luxury's like Acting, they just Run and Shoot. The Special Effects are the Real stars of the film, but they Still aren't as impressive as I expected, and they appear to In-frequently. The Ending is also a letdown, as it comes out of Nowhere and has no real Climax.
So What's to Enjoy, you ask... Well, it's all done in the name of Fun, it may take itself a little to Seriously, but It doesn't even Attempt to be anything New or Special, it merely attempts to Entertain. The Hurricane scenes are Impressively staged and the Sets look very Fitting.

1228107,1,B00000IQVM,"This thing is the absolute worst excuse for a film I have ever watched. There is absolutely no originality here at all. The Alien-meets-Speed idea sounds good on paper, but that is the only place it does. And there is a larger resemblence to the former than to the latter, because it keeps coming at you with action until you just get sick of seeing ,in this case, the evil robot in its umpteenth iteration, or they are trying to keep you occupied so that you will not realize how unoriginal this is. The dreadful plot had the crew of the tugboat Sea Star (Jamie Lee, William Baldwin, Donald Sutherland, and a bunch of unknowns) travelling the treacherous seas of the Pacific (or the Atlantic, or maybe even the Indian, the movie never says, aside from that it is on an ocean) in the middle of a storm. The boat loses its valuable cargo, and the captain (Sutherland) is about to shoot himself in the head when his ship finds another ship, a seemingly abandoned Russian research vessel that the crew hopes to claim salvage rights from. Of course greed gets in the way of judgment and they don't think why the ship is abandoned until they find out that a killer robot is trying to kill them all. It isn't just a robot, though, it is a being from outer space that was transmitted through a video linkup with the space shuttle. It took advantage of the advanced robotic systems on board to kill everyone it could and use them for parts. As in, to remove body parts. They borrowed from Sphere when the entity (what else can I call it) talks to the greedy crew and tells them this. It almost made me laugh, because although Sphere was definitely not a classic (the book was, the movie was average), this crud makes it look like Star Wars. The movie has nothing for the viewer that doesn't get turned on by excessive amounts of gore, but it does have bad characters, awful dialogue, not to mention a very non-surprise ending. The only characters that don't croak are the two ""perfect"" characters: perfect because they have no character flaws at all. (I don't want to give away the ending, so I won't reveal who they are, but if you have read this review or if you see the first 20 minutes of the movie, you don't have to be a genius to figure it out.) The only character I (and many others that watched this thing) almost liked was the Russian woman who was spared initially by this nameless entity, and I thought she might survive, until she was wasted by the alien as well. It's a struggle not to pull the video out of the player and ""infect"" it with gasoline, then light it on fire with a match. If you don't already see this piece of trash in the bargain bin at your local video store, you might find it in the garbage receptacle outside. Now I will use a quote from a famous Sherlock Holmes story and modify it: As you value your life and reason stay away from this movie. This goes beyond bad. I would give it negative stars if I could.
This is godawful crap to be avoided at all costs.",980467200,,2985,4.360861759425494
1228108,1,B00000IQVM,"Virus may seem like a god-awful movie at first, but with just a little work, you can make it surprisingly tolerable. Upon renting Virus, I decided to make it a little more interesting by playing a little drinking game. The game had the following rules (all based on the contents of the movie, incidentally):
1.) Every time the music swells for no reason whatsoever to heighten the ""spooky"" atmosphere -- take a drink.
2.) Every time Jamie Lee Curtis (she has a job on a boat -- and she's a WOMAN!) has an in-your-face confrontation with a male authority figure -- take a drink.
3.) Every time Jamie Lee Curtis is rescued by a male authority figure -- take a drink.
4.) Every scene Jamie Lee Curtis stops talking and starts screaming -- take a drink.
5.) Every time they pull the old ""cat trick"" (OH NO LOOK OUT BALDWIN CLONE -- oh, whew, it's just the cat!) -- take a drink.
6.) Every time the token Macho Black Guy says something macho (""I'm gonna mess you up, giant robot sucka"") -- take a drink.
7.) Every time someone yells ""It's gonna blow!""  -- take a drink.
8.) Every time a rock-stupid supporting character hears a mysterious sound from an air vent and responds by sticking his damn hand in there -- take a drink.
9.) Every time a rock-stupid supporting character gets himself killed by attempting the previous, or something similar, or just because it's been ten minutes and no extras have died yet -- take a drink.
10.) Every time the characters enter a room full of billowing smoke, flashing lights, and random sparks (man, who hired the electrician for all these abandoned starships and boats, anyway?) -- take a drink.
Yes, Virus is an offensive mishmash of cliches, pounded sternly into something resembling a script, and filmed -- evidently in great haste -- for your viewing pleasure. If you like monster movies, Virus does have one thing going for it, and that's a pretty impressive Giant Robot Thing at the end. But the rest is swill. Trite, recycled, boring, warmed-over swill. You've seen this movie so many times you can probably -- oh, let's say -- make a drinking game based on it, without seeing the movie first -- and be right about almost all of it. Try not to watch it sober if you can help it at all.

1228112,4,B00000IQVM,"I don't know, I really liked this goofy little film, it had a lot of things I like in big budget B-science fiction films, not least of which is  Jamie Lee Curtis who seems to be enjoying the Weaver effect wherein she  becomes more beautiful as she matures. I mean, sure we have seen this film  before in Alien, Leviathan, The Enemy Within, the list is actually endless,  but who cares, because `Virus' had some neat ideas to spruce up the old  concept of a haunted house. It also had some first rate talent, as Donald  Sutherland plays an extra crusty captain of the tug vessel Sea Star that  loses its barge of uninsured cargo in the middle of hurricane. However,  William Baldwin hasn't got anywhere near the talent or class of his  brother, Alec, and seems to coast through this film like he does in  anything he does.
 When a Russian research vessel monitoring the Mir  space station comes in contact with an alien space craft that infects it  with some form of attack program, it downloads it into a sea going  monitoring vessel. This program immediately learns all its can from the  database and sets about to make some little robot buddies. After a while it  discovers that its can't build some of the more advanced robot parts and  instead substitutes human body parts for those it can't make. When the Sea  Star finds the damaged Russian ship the suicidal captain believes they can  salvage it then force the Russian's to pay for the expensive ship's return,  but only so long as they aren't any survivors.
 The crew of the Sea  Star searches the dead ship- the power has been shut off and every  transmitter has been destroyed. And once power is restored things begin to  happen, such as crew members disappear while little scuttling attack robots  armed with nail guns begin to appear. Reactivated, the malevolent AI  continues its previous task of building cyborgs-robots assembled with human  parts it cannot build. The machine that begin to appear are gruesome  monstrosities-mechanical legs with muscles strong between them, bare skulls  with partial brains, etc. lots of H.R. Geiger type stuff. However, I myself  would have preferred a purely robotic look rather than add the visceral  human element. When the find a pretty science officer huddled in a locker,  the crew disbelievingly learns the fate of the crew, the captain just wants  to kill her so there aren't any survivors.
 The captain will get his  wish when he sells out his crew by convincing the AI that he is the  dominant life form among the humans which the AI considers an infections- a  Virus. The AI thanks the captain by eviscerating him then sends the new  Captain cyborg out after his former crew which is currently flooding holds  with fuel so they can blow up the ship. The captain has given the AI the  location of an island which contains a series of satellite transmitters  there which it can use to broadcast itself across the planet, infecting  everything. The success of which would actually make a pretty cool movie in  itself, sort of like Terminator but caused by aliens. Anyway, realizing  what is going on around it the AI dispatches its heaviest combat cyborg to  deal with these pesky human viruses before they blow up the ship.
  There are some silly things in this movie, and the characters are not all  that likeable, and I would have preferred the Sea Star crew to be a little  closer knit. These people have worked together for years one assumes and  the captain pulls a gun on his engineer in the first five minutes of the  film. The special effects are first rate, especially a lot of the model  work with the Russian science ship being tossed around in a hurricane. The  robots are very nice, with a neat arachnid look to them, but I would have  preferred if they had gone with the idea that, with each successive  generation of `bots built they look more and more advanced.

The crew: They allow themselves to be sent through a typhoon  by a clearly unstable captain.

If you're into  claustorphobic movies like 'Alien', 'The Fog' and 'John Carpenter's The  Thing' you won't be dissipointed by this masterpiece. Crank the  SurroundSound for this baby...you're going for a ride!",944092800,7,776,5.103174603174603
1228179,1,B00000IQVM,"I was disappointed in this movie because I really like Jamie Lee Curtis as an actress.  And, I still liked her in the movie.  However, the plot was ridiculously unbelievable, and the other characters were underdeveloped.  Donald Sutherland's character was too unpredictable and used too conviently  by the screenwriters to try to move the plot along.  As for William  Baldwin, I just don't think he's come along as an actor.  And overall, the  pacing of the movie was cumbersome.  Definitely skip this one.",943833600,6,506,5.0
1228210,3,B00000IQVM,"Jamie Lee Curtis and William Baldwin star in ""Virus"", the winter '98 thriller from visual effects artist turned director John Bruno (Terminator 2, The Abyss), and Universal Pictures. I rented this movie  about a month ago just before ""The Mummy"" was released on video,  I saw it because it seemed to look similar. When I saw it, I had mixed  feelings: The visual effects and robot  designs were  exelent.  The acting and  screenplay  needed a LOT of work.

1228212,5,B00000IQVM,"Yeah, we've seen all this before in different incarnations. The stranded boat thing has just about been done to death, particularly with ""Deep Rising"" just nudging its release. But you have to admit, it's pretty  cool! Gory cyborgs that mutilate and ""Borgify"" the crew one by  one, cool hurricane effects, and Joanna Pacula and Jamie Lee getting cold  and wet throughout! How can you go wrong with that formula? John Bruno's  directorial debut is an exciting, dark thrill ride. The CG work is awesome,  which compliments the practical robots nicely. Donald Sutherland (although  speaking with a very weak Scottish accent) never fails to bring a cold  creepiness to such films (see Puppet Masters, Invasion of the Body  Snatchers [1979]). The special features are cool too. Probably a 20 minute  Documentary, 5 minute featurette (mostly footage from the documentary), and  some deleted scenes. Only John Bruno is listed for the commentary, but in  fact 2 of the lesser role actors and the composer are also present. This is  a good movie and a good example of the possabilities of DVD.",938044800,7,1084,4.994413407821229

7911364,5,B00000IQVM,"A possessed computer makes robot minions, evil gory zombified cyborgs and a hulking destructive juggernaut to stalk a star-studded cast on a high-tech Russian vessel. Is this movie for you? Come on, you know who you are.

This gory 90s thrill ride opens when a spaceship (and/or lifeform) of pure energy ravages the MIR space station and beams itself down to a Russian research vessel only to be discovered by a desperate tugboat crew-turned-ship salvers hoping to return the seemingly abandoned, dead in the water ship for riches.

OUR CREW includes Captain Everton (Donald Sutherland; The Puppet Masters, Invasion of the Body Snatchers), his engineer (William Baldwin; Sliver, Flatliners), Kit (Jamie Lee Curtis; Halloween I-II, Scream Queens, Prom Night, The Fog), Woods (Marshall Bell; A Nightmare on Elm Street Part II, Starship Troopers, Total Recall), Squeaky (Julio Oscar Mechoso; Machete Kills, Planet Terror), Hiko (Cliff Curtis; Sunshine, Fear the Walking Dead, Push, Deep Rising) and Nadia (Joanna Pacula; The Kiss, Warlock: The Armageddon).

Based on Chuck Pfarrers Dark Horse comic series, director John Bruno (visual effects for Terminator 2, The Abyss, AVP: Aliens vs Predator, Fright Night, Poltergeist I-II) terrorizes a films tugboat salvage crew while sampling his favorite moments from the Predator and Terminator and Alien franchises, The Thing (1982) and Hardware (1990). It seems that Agent Smith (The Matrix trilogy) wasn't the only nonhuman entity to classify mankind as a virusour energy-based alien lifeform came to the same conclusion. To expedite the extermination, it hijacked the ships computer and electrical system, developed several castes of robot minions to do its murderous bidding, and eventually sought human victims for spare parts to make evil macabre cyborgs appearing as much zombie as robot! Basically, were dealing with a very small version of SkyNet becoming self-aware and, like Agent Smith, it even bargains with a greedy malevolent human.

The special effects span a broad range hitting us in three phases (i.e., as we learn more about our monster and its capabilities) but improve notably as the film progresses. At first, we find little robotic spiders and flies clumsily clunking about while dragging extension cords in their wake. And like little transformers, they have bitty nail guns and buzz saws. This is about as silly as it sounds but they're cute and boast a sort of practical effects charm.
Much as The Thing (1982), human victims are overtaken as cyborgs with a (now more evil) semblance of their conscious selves. They look like chunky macabre T-800s with a dash of Borginess (Star Trek: First Contact). This portion of the special effects will please gorehounds and lend credibility to a film already boasting a better cast than ever it deserved. This weird little flick is surprisingly decent!

The final phase of the effects is a CGI-enhanced stop-motion hulking menace; a giant robot undertaking the hive mother mainframes most destructive or dire tasks. This thing looks awesome and moves with frightful haste. It reminds me of the MCU Hulk as it bashes through walls and rends steel barricades.

This movie really holds up, continues to boast highly entertaining effects and gore, and is supported by an outstanding cast. Even the script felt highly capable (a rarity in films like this) and I had no major criticism from the direction. No, this is no Oscar winner. But this is not a bad movie. Its a pretty great sci-horror in terms of entertainment value and it deserves so much more attention.",1524441600,,3567,5.194782608695652

7911368,3,B00000IQVM,"Savaged by critics when it was released (""Deep Rising"" also set on a ship came out before this in 1998 and created the impression this film was derivative of that when, in fact, it was based on a 1995 screenplay turned into a comic book for Dark Horse comics), ""Virus"" is a well made, fun science fiction/horror thriller. Jamie Lee Curtis has gone on record as calling the film crap but that isn't fair to the finished product. ""Virus"" remains an entertaining B-movie with an interesting premise.

When a tugboat loses its uninsured payload in a vicious storm, the crew of the Sea Star discover a larger pay day with an abandoned Russian science vessel. The Captain (Donald Sutherland) claims the ship as a salvage not realizing that the ship harbors an extra terrestrial intelligence that intends to use the crew (Jamie Lee Curtis, Marshall Bell, William Baldwin, Cliff Curtis, Sherman Augustus, Julio Oscar, Mechoso) for its own purposes.

""Virus"" features some terrific practical effects and taunt direction by visual effects supervisor John Bruno (""Poltergeist"", ""The Abyss"", ""Kingsmen-The Secret Service""), that put it a cut above the average B-Movie.

""Virus"" looks and sounds the best it ever has on home video. The transfer looks extremely sharp with nice detail and has a nice film quality to it. The audio for both the 5.1 and 2.0 mix sounds pretty good with nice use of surround.

Shout Factory has done a spectacular job with this Blu-ray added considerable special features and importing over some others from the previous DVD. We get two commentary tracks with director Bruno and Marshall Bell on the older one and a second, new audio commentary with Bruno and writer Dennis Feldman. New to this set are the following featurettes: ""Eye of The Storm"" with director John Bruno; ""Science & Fiction"" with writer Feldman; ""Into The Woods"" an interview with Bell. We also get older special features including two vintage featurettes, deleted scenes, a theatrical trailer and still gallery.

For a film with such a negative reputation (19% on Rotten Tomatoes), ""Virus"" remains a preposterously fun and entertaining flick.

7911372,5,B00000IQVM,"For almost 20 years we have been given a vanilla disc of this late 90''s Sci fi gem. The movie is completely underrated. Let's start with the good, Jamie Lee Curtis may hate this movie but she delivers a strong female performance channeling Ripley and Sarah Connor. The effects are outstanding even all these years later. Films about killer robotics can age badly but Virus looks like it could have been made yesterday on a large budget. The film hold's up well and is entertaining as hell. As for the Scream Factory release .... we have some truly excellent new special features including a brilliant commentary track finally giving insight into the making of one of my favourite movies! Superb job! Really pleased",1501200000,2,715,4.821138211382114
