7959807,5,B000063UUJ,A wonderful lecture given by Mr. Tolle covering a wide array of topics.  Mr. Tolle has really proven himself as one of our finest speakers on the subject of spiritual transformation.  This tape is evidence of that.  I strongly suggest watching it if you've never seen or heard him speak because he really does have a powerful yet peaceful Presence that radiates when he speaks.  It really is unique to watch.  His main premise remains the same--Presence--Here & Now.,1061510400,16,466,4.848101265822785
7959808,5,B000063UUJ,"I own the audio version of The Power of Now. I also own Practicing the Power of Now. This simple video set offers new perspectives on Eckhart's teachings.
The Two video set is quite simplistic, but profound. Eckhart on his first video merely takes us along for the ride of consciousness awareness. My first viewing of tape one I was almost immediately relaxed and brought into presence.
He beautifully explains his various teachings while at the same time giving us a tremendous presence. I enjoy this tape set because you can see Eckhart, and his presence is relaxing, and his explanations profound. As posted below you can grasp Eckhart's basic teachings from postings on the backsides of the tapes themselves.
Also between both of the extensive tapes, the way Eckhart explains presence and shows simple exercises I found myself meditatively easily following his exercises by following Eckhart's gentle voice. His voice has a certain tone of quality to it, not easy to explain. His audio book shows this presence of tone, but I found his ad-lib presentation adds another aspect, or dimension to his teachings.
Tape Two is mostly of Eckhart answering questions from the audience. Eckhart gives each question a very keen and extensive answer, and goes into great depth in his explanations. As you can see below the two-tape set is quite long in time.
Eckhart gave me new perspectives regarding his book, also his simple exercises. I learned a new and powerful exercise from this video as well. But in closing I will say this tape series has truly touched my heart, quite deeply.

7959809,4,B000063UUJ,"There is much depth in this video on the human consciencness movement. I was able to better visualize and gain outside tangibles to better explain it to my 15 year old son as he is passing into this also. He enjoyed the second video and the ""pain body concept""! Eckhart is able to best descibe the evolving of this energy within us and how it changes our lives and why! I really enjoyed the tapes and have grown in better understanding thanks to his abilty to describe the process!",1016928000,27,481,4.415730337078652
