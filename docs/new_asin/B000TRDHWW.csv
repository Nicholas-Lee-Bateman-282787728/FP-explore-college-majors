8210492,5,B000TRDHWW,Gave this a five star rating because the instructor emphasizes listening to your body.  You get a great workout with options for more strenuous poses or lighter version.  I have been doing the one hour workout and feel stronger in my core and legs and have more mobility in my arms.,1394755200,,282,4.509803921568627
8210493,5,B000TRDHWW,"If you want a practical introduction to a beginner's yoga practice that can change your fitness and well being, take the next step and buy this wonderful DVD.  With grace and simplicity, Heidi Valenzuela keeps Yoga simple...with focus on the breath, easy flowing movements, and true acceptance of wherever you are that only a teacher with genuine kindness could achieve. She has included easy classes of 30 min and an hour, and separate tips for poses that sometimes require more explanation. Heidi's instruction is easy to receive and understand, like advice from a trusted friend. Some videos can come off as fake or overproduced but this is not the case here. Heid's DVD has truly mastered the art of real.",1193616000,2,709,4.908333333333333
8210494,5,B000TRDHWW,I'm a stay at home mom and I find Heidi's DVD a great way to add some relaxation to my day.  The tempo is great.  I feel like I am getting a good yoga workout and feel that it has benefited me in my other exercise classes.  I also really appreciate the demystified approach that Heidi uses.,1191283200,,290,4.052631578947368
8210495,5,B000TRDHWW,"This was my first venture into Yoga and I was very pleased.  Heidi, the instructor has put together a wonderful couple routines that are adaptable to all types of fitness.  The moves are challenging but not difficult and her demeanor and tempo are supportive, encouraging and comfortable.  What a great start to a Yoga life!",1189382400,2,324,4.8545454545454545
8210496,5,B000TRDHWW,"This is a wonderful yoga DVD!  Ms Valenzuela has provided four well-planned segments: an introduction, some tips, a 30-minute class, and a 60-minute class.  I particularly like the 30-minute session because I often have only 30 minutes at one time.  She has truly provided a program that is ""for all levels.""  Whether you're new to yoga or experienced, I'm sure you will appreciate the presenter's calm manner and clear direction.  She embodies the principles of yoga.",1187654400,5,468,5.105263157894737

If you like yoga class but can't work it into your schedule as often as you'd like, you can do this from home and still feel confident you're getting  good but gentle exercise and an excellent stretch all over.  Heidi gives you all the cues you need to stay focused and follow along while gaining confidence and expertise in  your own practice.  The option of a half hour or an hour workout further helps you incorporate yoga into busy days, when perhaps you need it most.",1187568000,,494,4.384615384615385
8210498,5,B000TRDHWW,"I have had the pleasure of practicing Heidi's program for 6 months, and the results have been amazing.  This is easy to follow/user friendly for the beginner, yet multi-leveled for the more advanced student.  I am able to participate in more strenuous physical activity, without the ""next day"" aches.  I'm really looking forward to Vol. 2, as much as I'm enjoying Vol. 1.",1184630400,,371,4.857142857142857
