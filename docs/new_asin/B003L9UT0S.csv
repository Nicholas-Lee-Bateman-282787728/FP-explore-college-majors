I have a full library of DVD's, Romanas, Peter's and many more - but these are my go-to's.",1490659200,,265,4.595744680851064
8507151,5,B003L9UT0S,"Watching Darien Gold move through the Original Pilates Intermediate Mat Repertoire is truly mastering in motion!
Her physique glides through these moves with exquisite articulation. It is a rare opportunity to view and learn the Pilates Mat moves with this level of skill. The filming is clear and easy to follow due to the black background and this gives the viewer a real chance at noticing detail that can help reveal where the strength and integrity of the body is being held while the mat moves are in motion. I highly recommend this for any person wishing to see what Pilates Mat is meant to be.

8507152,5,B003L9UT0S,"For those of you looking for the authentic intermediate mat workout (plus extras!), this is absolutely the best DVD available. Darien Gold's form and cues are impeccable. She stays true to the classic mat work and delivers a killer workout with minimal time investment - along with excellent production quality - this is truly the preeminent Pilates workout I've done outside of the studio.

I've been a Pilates student for 10+ years and have done my fair share of mat classes and at-home workouts. I've tried many Pilates DVDs over the years and most have been subpar, none have withstood the test of time. But this DVD is proving to be a very sound investment! I've had this DVD now for over 2 months and committed to doing the workout 5 times a week since I can only get to class once a week right now. Because the mat portion is under 15 minutes I really don't have an excuse to not do it! I also do the extras (Teaser and Rowing series) x3 week and that's only an additional few minutes. I also love that she has the option to to go through each exercise individually so I can really work on my form on some of the exercises I find challenging. I've really noticed a difference in my body and strength both on and off the mat!

I know often Pilates DVDs will run 30-45mins but this DVD stays true to Joseph Pilates matwork repertoire and delivers a superior workout in less time. I'm a big fan of the Classical method and highly recommend this DVD. Now that I've been consistently doing the workout, I just purchased Gold's Advanced DVD and can't wait to get it!",1445558400,,1567,4.4375

I've taken Pilates classes regularly in the past and was looking for something to do at home to get back into it. I chose the intermediate mat DVD since I was familiar with the exercises but was out of shape. For $20, I was expecting a longer, more intense workout--the complete mat workout was only 13 minutes long and did nothing for me. Darien went through each of the 24 exercises with a very limited number of repetitions, so there was never any muscle burn.

There is a second chapter in the DVD menu which has a written detailed explanation of how to do each exercise. This would be good if you haven't had any formal training in Pilates before and don't mind reading the instructions rather than viewing a demonstration.

She also has two additional workouts on the DVD: rowing series (3 minutes long) and teaser series (2 minutes long). The rowing series works the upper back pretty steadily, and the teaser series works the core pretty steadily, so both are more intense than the mat workout.

To sum up:

PROS:

excellent instruction
high quality sound and camera work

CONS:

not enough reps for the mat exercises; a minute spent on each exercise would have been nice.
way too short! I was looking for a 30-45 minute workout.",1355788800,,1343,4.685106382978724
8507154,5,B003L9UT0S,"Beautifully shot, elegantly performed movements, clear, concise narration--this DVD on Pilates is the best I've seen. It shows the  Intermediate Mat exercises and is not meant for beginners, though I hope Darien will consider doing that some day. I use it at home and plan to take it along when I travel. She even counts the reps aloud, so I can do the exercises without having to watch the screen. It's just plain good, that's all.",1279670400,3,432,4.684210526315789
