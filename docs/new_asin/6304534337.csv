The story follows three young friends through their young life as friends through a journey that none will forget.  The action is amazing, and in many ways some scenes are almost too intense to take.  I loved the movie, seeing what happened to each character, and the way some peoples lives end up far different than expected.

899378,4,6304534337,"I saw the director's cut of this film a number of years back when John Woo was ""hot"" in Hollywood terms.  It was, for the most part, pretty good, but it's not a perfect film.  The relationship between the 3 men is done in a very heavy handed, obvious way (they constantly, and I mean constantly, say ""we're buddies, we're supposed to stick together""), Waise Lee's character is very poorly written, and it's hard to believe in the usual ""lost innocence"" plot line when these guys are having gang fights at 15, and we're supposed to believe that life as smugglers in Vietnam made them hard boiled (so to speak).  Aside from that, the film has great setpieces (especially a shootout in a bar), the ending has a great shootout (even though thematically it's pretty obvious where it's heading) and the rapport of Simon Yam (who gives a good performance) and the 3 main characters is surprisingly believable.  As one reviewer has already said, Woo is erratic, even in his Hong Kong days.  Anyone who has seen Once a Thief or Just Heroes will attest to that.  Here, he's intermittenly brilliant and obvious, sometimes in the same scene.  It's worth watching if you're a Woo fan.  If not, you can probably skip the film.",1168732800,,1212,4.630841121495327
899379,2,6304534337,"This might be the perfect flick for a fourteen year-old who aspires to be a mass murderer. There is little to recommend it apart from the technical perfection of some of the cinematography and the staging of the scenes of mass destruction of people and property. Even these scenes have none of the balletic grace of Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"" films, his salute to the genre, or ""Reservoir Dogs,"" which has a mystery at its core and some fine acting and dialogue that temper the violence. [SPOILER ALERT]
""Bullet ..."" is little more than two hours of broken glass, fire, blood squirts, amputation, beatings and explosions. This makes Gladiator look like a Sunday school picnic. The characters are totally flat, one-dimensional. There is virtually no plot aside from excuses generated to wreak havoc. The acting is weak, static, despite the fact that I don't understand a word of Cantonese. We are presented with a series of stereotypes (the hooker with a heart of gold, the good friend, the crazy friend and the bad friend).
Unfortunately the American stereotype of the Viet Cong as madmen  -- and Saigon as hopelessly corrupt -- is reiterated here to the detriment of any understanding of Viet Nam during the American occupation. The worst thing is that -- because they are so shallow and undeveloped -- you don't care what happens to the characters. So I'll tell you and then you won't have to finish watching the film: [deleted due to pressure from masochists - so go to it].
My advice-- skip the film and go for a walk with some sharp pebbles in your shoes. It will be less painful.",1155427200,,1582,4.752727272727273
899380,2,6304534337,"It's a common belief that John Woo lost his way when he moved to Hollywood, but in truth his career was always highly erratic even in his Hong Kong days. For every Better Tomorrow or The Killer on his resume there's at least one disappointment on the level of Bullet in the head.

On paper Bullet in the Head looks like John Woo's most ambitious and under-rated film, but sadly it turns out to be an entirely derivative and largely ineffective shoot-em-up that blows its few good ideas in all the overkill. There's the germ of a good idea in its sprawling tale of three friends who skip the rioting Hong Kong of 1967 to make their fortune in the chaos of Vietnam, but it's quickly lost amid the cartoon carnage - this is the kind of film where Woo will add a bomb disposal man having his arms blown off to the background of a romantic parting, and that's one of the more subtle scenes. Clunking construction and wild leaps of logic abound (it's hard to take Jacky Cheung's cries of ""Don't make me commit murder!"" seriously after we've just seen him gun down thirty people) and the tragedy of Vietnam is reduced to the level of a video game in several over the top and largely uninvolving action scenes.

There are a few mildly effective moments, such as Simon Yam's memorable introduction, but the lasting impression is of a hack who has seen The Deer Hunter and The Killing Fields several times without ever really understanding them. Horrendously disappointing. No misjudged underappreciated lost masterpiece, just a mess - and even more so  in  this  cut  DVD.",1140825600,,1563,4.60431654676259
899381,4,6304534337,"Though not wholly successful, ""Bullet in the Head"" is at the very least ambitious in it's themes.  What I found interesting here was John Woo's perspective on the Vietnam conflict.  He doesn't take sides and I gather he views it as a moral quagmire from all sides.  He also makes interesting observations about the bounds of friendship as the three friends at the center of the film, who are on the lam from Hong Kong and in the thick of the Vietnam chaos, are tested by the avarice around them.  Why I don't wholeheartedly endorse the film is alot of the gunplay here borders on overkill.  While this kind of firepower is effective in a film like ""The Killer"" or ""Face/Off"" it kind of negates the message of a film that purports to be of weightier themes.",1137542400,,756,4.489051094890511
899382,4,6304534337,"This is one of the John Woo's Best films.

He takes his viewers through the Darkness in his most personal work an epic depicting of the lives of three childhood friends trapped in hell through the turmoil of the War in Vietnam.

899383,5,6304534337,"Those people familiar with John Woo's work might know what to expect from this movie -- except you won't.  This was one of Woo's final Hong Kong films before he went to Hollywood, and it is rivalled only by his masterpiece ""Hard Boiled"".  But while Hard Boiled offered pure action, Bullet in the Head is an entirely different story.  It's neither a typical Vietnam film, nor is it a typical HK action flick -- instead it's a shattering drama about friendship and brotherhood violently destroyed.  In the past, to friends who aren't familiar with Woo's work, I've described his films as ""chick flicks for guys"" -- which is accurate.  Woo invokes feelings of fraternity and male friendship like female-oriented movies tend to do for the opposite gender.  In Woo's world, violence (even theatric, unrealistic violence) is one of the few ways the male can express his emotions, even if the violence is forced on him by the circumstances.  When one friend betrays another -- as happens in this film -- the consequences are staggering.  At this point, late in the film, Woo produces the most dramatic scenes ever seen in any of his films.  This is my favorite Woo film ever -- and for good reason.",1098576000,,1191,4.742718446601942
899384,4,6304534337,"To say ""Bullet In The Head"" is just another one of Woo's gun-slinging, bullet-dodging feel-good action movies would be to discredit the director's much more ambitious undertaking on this project.  No doubt ""Bullet"" delivers the usual action thrill ride to satisfy the average fan of this genre, but a closer look will tell you that Woo is also attempting a serious discourse here on the socio-political upheavals in 1960's Asia, and more importantly, an examination of human nature in relation to war and violence.

The story takes place in Hong Kong in the 1960's.  Three young men (played by Tony Leung Chiu Wai, Jacky Cheung, and Waise Lee) with distinct personalities, but all from the same poor working class neighborhood, decide to embark on a Chinese mafia-sponsored smuggling scheme to Vietnam.  They arrive at their destination, only to find that the chaos and violence on the streets of Saigon isn't much different from that of the world that they had known back in Hong Kong.  Soon they are making enemies with the mafia, and are hunted by the South Vietnamese military.  Ultimately, their friendship is called into question as they consume themselves in a deadly melee bound by survival, greed and vengeance.

All of Woo's classic themes are on display in this movie --- namely the themes of fraternity, vengeance, and the tragic hero.  However, the portrait of Asia in the 1960's as a historical backdrop to the story proves to be more than incidental.  The period was an era of great social and political turmoil in Asia, as it was in most of the other parts of the world.  Hong Kong was deeply divided between the royalists and the anti-imperialist student movement spurted by the new communist regime in Mainland China (Woo himself has actually said that he had taken inspiration from the political unrest from the 1989 Tiananmen Square student protests in China in making this movie), whereas Vietnam saw itself torn apart by a bloody civil war that knew no bounds to its horrific toll on its own people.  Woo, although probably bogged with the usual problems that plagues Hong Kong cinema, namely a low budget and production values, manages to capture the chaos and distress of his generation --- there are plenty of realistic scenes of student protesters clashing with the police on the streets of Hong Kong, and guerilla warfare in the muddy jungles of Vietnam.  Woo first exposes the corruptive South Vietnamese regime, and the ruthlessness that it employs in treating the revolutionaries, however, the audience soon sees the communist rebels in the mountains, whose bloodthirsty and sadistic ways mirror the very regime that they are trying to overthrow.  Caught in the crossfire are the lives of innocent civilians, who become sacrifices to a war where there's really no rights and wrongs, and where human beings are merely pawns in the quest for power and fortunes.  One actually begins to wonder whether or not the director is asserting an anti-war message in this movie.

As is characteristic with most of Woo's early Hong Kong work, the brilliance of this movie lies not in the plot and its execution, which is at times loose and hasty, but in the way the actors shine through the sincere portrayals of their characters.  Tony Leung (""In The Mood For Love"") delivers a convincing performance as the conflicted leader of the pack, who faces many internal strives throughout the movie.  Waise Lee (""A Better Tomorrow"") paints a decent transformation of a man who turns into a monster consumed by greed.  The award for most notable performance, however, must go to Jacky Cheung.  Cheung (""As Tears Go By""), a Cantonese pop singer by trade in real life, plays a man who is pushed past the edges of his humanity by the insanity of war and sadistic violence, and who goes through the dramatic change from a working class street delinquent to a deranged, cold-blooded assassin who kills for money to fill his morphine addiction.  Cheung succeeds in delivering a convincing performance with a sort of unreserved sincerity in his acting.  That sincerity, although at times a bit overly earnest in this movie, is genuine throughout.  One can not help but feel both pity and indignation for his character as he wrestles madly for the injection syringe, and stares blindly into the eyes of his long-lost friend, Leung, as the latter decides that he must kill his best friend in order to save him from further suffering.

In the end, Woo does not offer a moralistic judgment on his characters or the events surrounding them in this movie, as is true with a lot of his other work.  What he is more interested in here is how a human being reacts, and is transformed by the situation that he's forced into.  In this case it's three young and ambitious men who had set out to take over the world, but in confronting the realities of war and violence, find that it's the exact opposite that takes place.  Also thematic of Woo's work is that the victory of the good in the face of evil is never obvious, even the line between good and evil itself is extremely elusive, and the heroes do not always live.  What he seems to be implying here is that violence and virtues are often irrevocably linked, and the survival of the body is determined by the survival of the will.",1093996800,,5277,4.808628318584071

899386,5,6304534337,"This rivals the killer as the best John Woo film. People say this one isn't his best but I disagree.
It's also one of the most violent Hk films I've ever seen, the shootouts are intense and well done, like the nightclub scene, it was very well done with the best part is when Paul guns down about 20 guys with a machine gun in a stairwell.
The acting is pretty good, the best performance goes to Tony Leung of course but Paul (Waise Lee) and Luke (Simon Yam) have some strong stellar scenes, and the so-so award goes to Jacky Chueng who in the POW camp scene makes you want to almost laugh at his suffering. However this version is cut about 18 minutes from what I've heard, and most of the subtitles are wrong and the audio is choppy. The extra 18 mins would probably explain some of the confusing scenes and scenarios (where did they learn how to shoot machine guns and shotguns with one hand?). Too bad this isn't A better tomorrow 3 because Chow Yun Fat would have been EXCELLANT in Luke's Character.
The story goes like this Three lifelong friends find themselves in trouble in 1967 British ruled Hong Kong when. On his wedding night Ben (Tony Leung) and Frank (Jacky Cheung) kill a gang leader in a fight. So they (Including Paul for some reason) get the idea to go to war torn Vietnam to sell illegal goods, but their luck turns sour when there stuff is blown up in a bombing. After that they meet Luke (Simon Yam) who puts their friendship in a downward spiral from there on in. Paul gets greedy when he takes a casket of gold leaves and turns him into a cynical, ""stay-away-from-my-gold or Ill kill you"" person while the friendships fall to pieces.
The action scenes while heartfelt (In a disturbing way) and gut wrenching are pretty senseless and over-the-top. The POW camp scene is absolutely disturbing almost to the point where I turned it off. To tell you the truth I'd rather see what's in this POW scene then what's in the uncut full POW scene (Yes its THAT disturbing). This film is NOT a heroic bloodshed film there is no heroes in this only people whose lives we must watch fall to pieces. You'll have to be pretty used to disturbing violence to see this so be very prepared. Very very well done and One of my Highest Recommendations ever!

899432,2,6304534337,"In ""The Killer"", perhaps the best pulp/asian thriller of all time, the violence felt full, voluptuous; its excess created a kind of operatic grandeur.  In ""Bullet in the Head"" the violence is so over -the-top, so gratuitous, you want to run for cover (I might have blown up my tv if I had to watch another gangster do a cartwheel as a big explosion lifted him of his feet).  This movie proves to me how repetitive a director Woo is, and I got a similar feeling from Face/Off - its like watching a figure skater do figure 8's all night - you want to shout ""ok, I get it!""

But it contains some disturbing themes that is mixed in the violence which may put off some viewers.
However, this particular disturbing POW killing scene is captured and edited with quality skill.
This may embark John Woo to make a realistic-warfare film, a product simalar to 'Saving Private Ryan'.

That is the basic premise for this 1990 John Woo movie set in The Vietnam War. It is a combination of action, drama, loyalty, honor, and so much more. I strongly recommend it, however, be aware that this movie is not for the weak at heart. There are many disturbing scenes, including the infamous POW camp scene.

899439,2,6304534337,"I think my major beef with this film is the paper-thin simplicity with which almost every character is presented.  It reminded me of really bad Shakespeare.  The movie begins incoherently with a lame fight scene between  poorly dressed Chinese youth, to the tune of something out of West Side  Story.  This left me scratching my head.  Then we get the requisite  back-story on each character, hmm... where I have I seen THIS story before?  (Perhaps a better question would be, where HAVEN'T I seen this story  before).
You've got the ""handsome one,"" the ""stupid  one,"" and the sullen ""greedy one.""  And let me clue you in,  THEY NEVER LEAVE CHARACTER throughout the ENTIRE FILM!  The ""pretty  one"" is always pontificating and grating, the ""dumb one"" is  always bumbling a la Curly from the 3 Stooges, and the ""greedy  one"" never shakes his gold addiction for long enough to be anything  except boring (though the boring one is the best actor here).
The boring  side-story of the drug-addicted pop-singer that the boys all fawn over  (yawn), the boring filler scenes (lets bike ride along the river!  why! ),  the SAME ""touching"" happy-birthday-sounding music that creeps in  whenever there is a melodramatic moment (and in this film, there are VERY  FEW non-melodramatic moments), the ridiculous A-Team maneuvers that happen  when hoards of ""enemies"" come swarming upon the good guys (when  Luke detonates the charges by the river).  Is this naivete supposed to be  endearing?
Which brings me to a good point, Luke is the only redeeming  quality of this movie.  Cool guy, good actor, decent part, knows his stuff.  Too bad the movie wasn't centered around him.
And, honestly, if this is  a ""war movie"" I'll eat my hat.  The only war they find is the one  that the 3 Stooges bumble into while on their nonsensical and poorly  portrayed quest for... whatever they left HK looking for.  Granted, the  prison camp scenes were gruesome (in fact, almost too gruesome, and much  too prolonged) but that contrasts very poorly with the constant mugging,  double-takes, and over-the-top melodrama.

Bullet in the Head is John Woo's version of the third part of the ""A Better Tomorrow"" saga... or Tsui Hark's ABT 3 is another version of Bullet in the Head, depending on  who you trust.
The Amazon review of ABT3 (by David Chute, see elsewhere  on this site) states that John Woo wrote the script, but was supplanted by  Tsui Hark as director of the movie. There is no hard evidence of  this.
Apparently, Tsui Hark and John Woo competed to shoot and release  their own version of the script of ABT3... I don' know who was faster, but  Tsui Hark had the rights to the title. According to articles in the trade  specialist press (HK Orient Extreme, possibly the most professional  magazine on Asian cinema worldwide), they had worked together on the script  before they ended their collaboration. So ""A Bullet in the Head""  and ""A Better Tomorrow 3"" are actually 2 versions of the same  storyline. The differences and variations, and the way each of these two  geniuses shot their own version is quite interesting. For those who know Ho  Chi Minh City (Saigon), the way each of the two directors shot the outdoor  scenes is also quite interesting.
Whose version is the best? In any  case, the two movies are great, and they are even better when compared to  each other (if that makes sense).
Who owns the actual story? My personal  intuitive inclination goes to Tsui Hark, who was always a better writer  than John Woo and had a personal involvement in this story (if I'm not  wrong, he grew up in Saigon and witnessed the fall of the city). For one  thing, he depicts the city and its people with more empathy and depth than  John Woo.  But I may be wrong : If someone has the final word or some kind  of historical angle on this, please enter your review, I'll be glad to read  more on this.

[Die Xie Jie Tou]

(Hong Kong - 1990)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Mono

Produced in the wake of the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, John Woo's BULLET IN THE HEAD is both a response to the appalling violence that was taking place in mainland China at the time, and a pointed examination of the director's traditional themes of loyalty and brotherhood and the consequences of betrayal. For all its explosions and gunplay, however, the film is a very human drama, played out against the vast backdrop of the Vietnam conflict, and invested with such a palpable sense of love and  compassion for its leading characters and their circumstances that it defies all attempts at categorisation.

The cast is pure gold: Tony Leung (superb as the film's tragic 'hero'), Jacky Cheung (giving a revelatory, career-making performance) and Waise Lee play lifelong friends who flee from a murder rap during the civil unrest of 1960s Hong Kong, only to have their loyalties tested to breaking point by their experiences in wartime Saigon. Overall, the film is less an action-thriller than an operatic valentine to Woo's teenage years in HK and to the personal values which have shaped and defined his films since A BETTER TOMORROW. Only HARD-BOILED comes close to it in terms of greatness, though many people - myself included - would argue that BULLET is not only Woo's finest achievement to date, but also one of the best films ever made, anywhere.",948412800,,1471,4.939271255060729

This DVD is an example of how good Hong Kong films can look on the  format, with a sharp transfer that adds an extra dimension to the film. The  only minor (and I mean minor) problems with this film is that the picture  ""jumps"" up very slightly in a few places, and that when English  is being spoken the Subs. don't match the dialouge.
Also, the sound  quality, remixed into 5.1, is slighlty disappointing. It sounds a bit  ""tinny"", lacking some depth, although the beautiful theme has  never sounded better! You do get a few extras, although ""a few""  is exaclty right: the trailer, coming attractions and  filmographies.

it is not A BETTER TOMORROW, A BETTER TOMORROW 2 or THE KILLER.
It is BULLET IN THE HEAD.
It is very real and truely well made.

7874235,4,6304534337,"Bullet in the Head(1990) is one of John Woo's personal movies. It's an action packed film, but it's also a tear jerker drama with shocking scenes. The film takes place in Hong Kong in 1967. After killing a gang member, three Chinese guys hide in Vietnam. They try to get rich off the war, but the war ruins their friendship. In one scene, we can see a statue of Jesus Christ as a prisoner of war is murdered! Bullet in the Head is not perfect. The middle feels like a Rambo movie! Also, Jacky Cheung's acting is a little hammy. Tony Leung plays our hero. We get to hear a cover of I'm a Believer by The Monkees. This film is The Deer Hunter seen through Woo's eyes. Woo also borrows stuff from his own childhood. The car joust scene was recycled in Face/Off(1997). Bullet in the Head was a box office flop in 1990. This film is an underrated classic from John Woo's career.",1360454400,,873,4.296969696969697
7874236,5,6304534337,"This is one I had been meaning to see for a while and it really was worth waiting for. It comes from cult director John Woo and was made in 1990, by which time he had garnered enough praise to be able to fund such an ambitious project. Set in 1967 it tells the story of three friends Little Wing, Fai and Ah Bee (Tony Leung Chiu Wai of `Internal Affairs' and `Hero' fame). They have sworn to be brothers and live life like 1950's street roustabouts who love a good `rumble' with the local ne'er do wells. This is set in 1967 so is more than plausible. Meanwhile a marriage is in the offing but a fight ensues with a rival gang and things spiral out of control. So the three friends decide to do a runner and make some money at the same time.

This is achieved by smuggling goods onto the black market in war torn Vietnam. Once they get there things do not pan out as expected and they find they need to come up with a `plan B' quicker than you can say `Viet Cong'! This then is really an action packed film that does not waste any of its two hour running time. It deals with a lot more than the criminal underside of Hong Kong's society; it also is about love, friendship, betrayal and revenge with a helpful dose of war thrown in. On the way we get some first rate action scenes with none of the money saving CGI malarkey, these are proper shoot outs and the guns do run out of bullets. It has some very strong and even disturbing scenes in it too so will not be for those who are easily shocked etc.

John Woo always gives value for money and this is no exception, the plot developments are not the `twist' type of thing but seem much more organic and therefore believable. It is far from Hollywood too so do not expect a Walt Disney ending. It is also in more than one language with very good subtitles. If you like Hong Kong crime flicks then this is one not to be missed and it has not lost any of its potency even after all these years, I can not recommend highly enough, but not one for the kiddies though.",1344038400,,2013,4.13265306122449
7874237,5,6304534337,"I have the 2 Disc Digitally remastered version of this movie, not the one pictured on this page. I would recommend the version I have of it. This was an excellent movie. Tony Leung Chiu-Wai was wonderful in this film...what film has he not been great in??  He always knows how to pick his roles carefully. He looks so young in this film as does Simon Yam. The story is about how greed corrupts the loyalty of three male friends set against the backdrop of the terrible tragedy that was the Vietnam War. The story is timeless though. Typical John Woo overkill literally with all the gun battles in this. Some of the movie seems a little dated now given the time at which is was produced (1990) but even taking that into account I still liked it a lot and am giving it 5 Stars.

7874239,5,6304534337,"Fresh off The Killer, John Woo and Tsui Hark part ways. It paid off big time. Woo directs Tony Leung Chiu Wai, Jacky Cheung, Waise Lee and Simon Yam in this slightly Deer Hunter-like tale of innocence lost, brotherhood, greed and betrayal. If you like over the top gut-wrenching violence then you'll love this. It is quite a long movie for a John Woo film but given the subject matter and its drawn out scenes it is exceptable. The performances are top-notch. Tony Leung's quiet manner which turns into a volcano of erruption was done to perfection. Waise Lee recycles his Shing character from A Better Tomorrow sorta but is given enough material to make him a more human character and succeeds in every way. Simon Yam is of course ultra cool in this. In fact he is the Mark Gor of BITH. Finally, Jacky Cheung steals the show and I am not surprised that he got nominated for Best Supp. Actor at the HK Awards. As a whole, this film is one of John Woo's best. I concider this only second to The Killer. This Dvd also features John Woo's intended alternate ending which is much better. Please get this DVD.",1298851200,,1104,4.47029702970297
7874240,4,6304534337,"It goes without saying that Bullet in the Head is one of the greatest, most moving films in John Woo's considerable oeuvre.  This review focuses on the DVD.  First off, the case looks incredibly bootlegged, but as far as I know, it's legit.  Anyway, the picture quality is all right, though it does have a tendency to get grainy from time to time, particularly during transistion and every so often a line will appear on the screen.  This is the theatrical cut, which is roughly 10 minutes shorter thant the special edition.  You don't miss much, but the editing did leave a few awkward jumps and cut out some dialog here and there. The biggest problem is without a doubt the subtitles.  The film has none built in and its up to your dvd player to supply them.  As a result, you end up with some tragically babel fish-esque translations.  You can piece it together, usually, but it kind of ruins the mood.  Not to mention the fact that the translation are simply not accurate, as evidenced by the english subtitles when the actors speak in English. That said, this problem won't ruin the film's overall impact and if you haven't seen it, this is the cheapest dvd version of the film on Amazon, which was my reason for buying it.  I would more recommend the special edition, but I cannot, in good conscience, encourage you to spend that much money.",1297555200,,1347,4.551867219917012
7874241,5,6304534337,"This isn't so much a review on the Film itself as it is a review on the actual DVD. 'Bullet in the Head' has not been officially available on any US video labels so if you are a John Woo fan, especially of 'Hard Boiled' and 'The Killer' you should definitley seek this film out, it is easily one of his best. I keep hoping that Dragon Dynasy or Anchor Bay or Criterion will release it, but until then This is the Best that there is. so if you have seen 'Bullet In the Head' or own the Tai Seng DVD or VHS then this review is for you.

  I first saw 'Bullet..' in the mid 90's after seeing 'The Killer' and 'Hard Boiled'(had to pay 40 bucks to special order it from Suncoast and wait over a month to receive it) this was a TAI Seng release and a little known thing about Tai Seng is that a lot of their VHS releases were in the Pan & Scan format. This is normal for a VHS release but the kicker was that these films were released theatrically with Chinese subtitles and English subtitles and when they put them on Video they didn't remove the subtitles from the print and digitally add them like they do for DVD so when they crop the sides of the screen to recreate the 1.33:1 image they are also chopping off some of the subtitles. Which is not too bad for a film in the 1.85:1 aspect ratio like this film but if you were to watch Tai Seng's Prodigal Son VHS which was shot in 2.35:1 you'd be lucky if you could make out most of the subtitles.

  Now the Tai Seng VHS for 'Bullet..' was slightly letterboxed, not in the actual 1.85:1 aspect ratio however. I know this b/c in the opening credits it starred Tony Leung, Jacky Cheung and Waise Le, that's right it chopped off the second 'e' in Waise Lee's name, so the image was slightly cropped resulting in the loss of some subtitles but not nearly as bad a some of Tai Seng's other releases. Also since the subtitles were on the actual print you do lose a generation of film quality, so the picture quality was not too great. Also Unknown to me at the time was that the VHS was 6 mins shorter than the eventual DVD. I can only assume this was because the VHS could fit two hours and the movie was two hours and six or so minutes. You could tell watching it becuase some of the cuts in the film very, very abrupt at times and these were all areas where the DVD had more footage. None more noticable than the chase scene at the end. In the DVD there is a build up to the chase starting in the parking garage. On the VHS, however, they exchange looks in the garage and it immediately cuts to them speeding down the street and shooting at eachother. If you have the Tai Seng VHS, burn it and throw it away.

  Tai Seng eventually issued the film on DVD (a fifty dollar special order this time) which had the film at 126 mins featuring a lot of little moments that were cut out on the VHS. The film was a non-anamorphic letterbox that was in the proper aspect ratio though. The subtitles were digital but the picture quality wasn't much better than the VHS. There were several instances of 'digital grain' throughout the whole film that is a result of a poor digital mastering for the DVD. There were no special features unless you count a theatrical trailer and some text bios.

  The Two Disc 'Ultimate Edition' is by far the best of all the released I have seen. The film is anamorphic widescreen and the image is much cleaner than the previous DVD, not as good as Dragon Dynasty's remastered 'Hard Boiled' but what do you expect from a film that isn't readily available in The US yet? The film gives you the choice the watch the 130 min theatrical version, watch the theatrical version with deleted scenes 'seamlessly branched' in, or the alternate ending (sans car chase). I watched the version with the alternate ending and there was a slight pause when it changed over to the new ending and the film quality is noticebly different as is the sound quality, but it isn't so bad that it's unwatchable and makes for a different viewing experiecne.

  The special features are nothing special, there is a bizarre special about different guns and their uses and best ways to stratergize their use intercut with clips from the film. This virtually has nothing to do with the film and is essentially a waste of time. There are deleted scenes and an alternate ending, the same that you can watch in the movie on disc 1, but it's nice to have them separate. They are also nothing too special, the alternate ending is dramatically interesting as it is so different from the one in there now, but most of the deleted scenes are VERY. VERY brief, aside from one where they are forced to drink piss at gun point in the bar, most are just some extra shots. Finally there is a brief but interesting interview with Waise Lee that is 10 mins. I wish it was longer and I wish there were more interviews with some of the others involved in the film but what's there in the interview is good. Most frustrating is the fact that Lee says the film was originally over three hours long and no, none of that footage is on the DVD.

  If you don't own this movie this is the version to get, If you have the Tai Seng DVD this is worth uprading for the remastered, anamorphic video alone. Hopefully one day a master, deluxe version with participation from Woo will be released, but until then this is the best version available.",1238371200,,5351,4.312749003984064
