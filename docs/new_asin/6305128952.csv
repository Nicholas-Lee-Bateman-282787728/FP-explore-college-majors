973260,5,6305128952,"Review of The Horse Whisperer
Hot Toasty Rag, September 25, 2017

While Ive always maintained that Robert Redford was born to play Jay Gatsby, his role in The Horse Whisperer is probably the best representation of his persona we all know and love. Hes a rancher who loves nature and helps heal wounded horses. Is there a more suitable film for the voice of the National Resources Defense Council and the creator of Sundance?

A fourteen-year-old Scarlett Johansson stars as a teen girl who, following a tragic horseback riding accident, loses all hope and light in her life. Her parents, Sam Neill and Kristin Scott Thomas, handle the aftermath differently, and her go-getter mom contacts the famous horse whisperer doctor to help heal Scarletts horse. Robert Redford is the title character, and when he refuses to come to New York, Kristin packs up her daughter and the horse and drives to his ranch in Montana.

Filmed in the natural beauty of Montana, the audience cant help but fall in love with the exquisite animals and sceneryand Robert Redford. He directs this movie as well as stars in it, and his slow, sensitive directorial touch is so perfect for this story. I cant imagine another director treating the script with such love. Its not a fast-paced horseback riding film; its a filmed healing process. Anyone whos ever experienced a physical or emotional hurt knows the healing process takes time and effort, and even the smallest gesture, like turning off the stove to show you're really listening, can help.

The acting in The Horse Whisperer is pretty fantastic. Anyone who sees Scarletts incredible talent in this film will not understand why shes stuck making comic book movies now. While Kristin Scott Thomas is very convincing as a Type-A, controlling, cold career woman, she is by far my worst part of the movie. Shes unlikable, from beginning to end. One could argue that her character is supposed to be unlikable, but I disagree. Had Emma Thompson been cast in the role, she would have been controlling and driven, but she also would have had an underlying warmth. You would have sensed that even though shes doing or saying something wrong, she has good intentions. Kristins entire aura is repellant, and because of this casting error, part of the plot is entirely unbelievable.

There are many great reasons to watch The Horse Whisperer, and one last compliment Ill bestow is to Thomas Newmans beautiful, memorable score. The most important element to a score is that the audience really feels whats going on in the movie when they listen to the music. When you hear Thomas Newmans music, you feel the injured horse slowly healing and learning to trust again.",1506297600,,2682,4.885714285714286

973343,5,6305128952,"This is a a very fine movie from an artistic viewpoint.  It is the story of a young lady and her horse being injured and the ensuing rehabilitation of both of them.  Much of the film is set in the American West and the cinematography is wonderful.  The cast is outstanding.  The story is heartwarming.

Robert Redford produced, directed, and starred in this movie.  Having no experience in film making, I cannot imagine how one directs and stars in a film.  That, to me, is an amazing accomplishment, assuming the movie is also excellent.  This is the case here.  This movie has really made me respect Robert Redford as an artist.

I realize that the movie may be somewhat fanciful in regard to the reality of training horses.  For me this is an entertainment and viewing experience.  I like this movie very much and can watch it more than once.  Thank You...",1500508800,,859,4.572368421052632

973521,3,6305128952,This seems to be the role that Robert Redford was born to play.  He really seems to be the character and not acting. The movie is kind of slow and dragged out in places.  Scarlet Johansson is good as a young girl who goes out with a friend to ride their horses on a snowy winters day.  What happens is hard to watch.  Kristen Scott Thomas is he Mother who refuses to put the horse down and travels from New York to see if Robert Redford can help.  She is a married city woman who doesn't fit in or understand the ranch life. But falls in love with Redford anyway.  I don't think it  really works as a love story.  And I think the movie should have ended with the rehab of the horse.  But it keeps going with should she leave or should she stay.  This is the kind of movie that is good every once in awhile.  It is worth watching for Robert Redford.  Dianne Wiest and Chris Cooper are also very good.,1494633600,,899,4.074285714285714

She finally finds a horse whisperer and drives to Montana, hoping he will help her.  Her daughter comes along but would rather not be there until later.

In the end, this movie was a chance for Hollywood to take a popular meme, pretend to creatively bring it to life, while in reality lazily filling the whole movie with one of the few things Hollywood knows how to do, which is create drama through romance. Except that even the romance in this movie is hella lame. There's nothing ""horse"" or ""whisperer"" about this movie except the title. Well, maybe I'm being a bit too critical. After all, Hollywood's a one-trick ""pony"" with its romance schtick, so there's some ""pony"" in that romance, but it's a phony pony.",1478304000,,636,4.790909090909091

It is more of a public service announcement.] There seems to be a lot of confusion regarding Amazon's use of the term ""Multi-Format"" to describe certain discs. I just bought the ""multi-format"" version of The Horse Whisperer. Here is what I found. There is only one disc in the package. It is a Blu-ray disc. There is no digital copy of any kind. (As of 14-April-2016 the ""multi-format"" version is priced at $9.11 on Amazon. The ""region-free"" Blu-ray version is currently priced at $22.89 on Amazon). The only ""multi-format"" aspect of this disc seems to be the various audio formats and subtitle languages available. The Blu-ray video resolution is standard 1080p Widescreen (2.35:1). There are no other video format choices available. The Audio formats available are English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, French: Dolby Digital 5.1, and Spanish: Dolby Digital 2.0. Subtitles are available in English SDH (subtitles for the deaf or hard-of-hearing), French, and Spanish. This disc is authorized for sale in the U.S.A. and Canada only, although other sites have claimed that it is region free (there is no region specified on the cover or the disc). So, if you want a reasonably priced Blu-ray version of The Horse Whisperer, in my opinion, the ""Multi-Format"" version is the easy choice.",1460592000,3,1449,5.1440677966101696

My daughter is a horse expert and finds substantial fault in the film: the way the girls handle their horses in the beginning, some of the methods the ""Whisperer"" uses, especially exhausting the horse as a means of training, the quick resolution.

Montana looks beautiful--the film is beautifully photographed. Makes me want to go there (in the summer!).",1452902400,3,397,4.925373134328358

974875,3,6305128952,"The book was better. I would not have understood all that was going on in the movie if I had not read the book just the day before; some things are simply not explained very well. Both book and movie begin with a tragedy. Two young girls, Grace and her friend, are involved in a brutal accident during a horseback ride in the snowy woods. One of them is killed and the other is maimed. Grace's horse, Pilgrim, is severely injured. Later, Grace's father comments to her mother, ""Judith is dead."" But Grace's friend was never introduced as Judith, so the viewer is left to wonder. Other characters in the movie are never given a name at all. Subsequently, Grace's mother, Annie, a very bossy and stubborn woman, seeks to find a way to heel Grace and Pilgrim, and that journey is the story of the movie.

Robert Redford, in his infinite wisdom, changed the characters and the plot. The movie has a completely different ending than the book, and that ending does not work as well. I really hate it when that happens. To be fair, the book was about 450 pages long and had to be altered somewhat to fit into a movie format. I would have cut different things than Redford did. For instance, the movie had far too much barn dancing for my taste, and the horse ran around in far too many circles.

Some of the interior scenes and shadowy outdoor scenes were not lit well enough for the viewer to see what was happening. The location changes were very abrupt and a bit confusing, especially in the beginning. The Montana scenery was, indeed, spectacular.

This is a touching movie, and it is appropriate for family viewing.",1449100800,,1613,4.517123287671233

Yes that's what I said - Horrible.
If your a horse lover (I am) and a parent (I am) with a shred of morality, this movie was a total let-down.
The first half of the movie nearly had me in tears. A tragic accident, and broken child and horse, and a mother desperately trying to heal both.
Then the old Hollywood - actually new Hollywood - new aged morality kicks in.
It becomes the Robert Redford show. Mom falls for the horse whisperer, has an affair, and considers dumping Dad.
Daughter is already psychologically and  severely physically scared for life - now let's dump all this on her???
Typical new aged theme - ""its all about me, and it sucks to be you child.""
How selfish and cold.
Doesn't anyone see this? Or is the new liberated audience so enthralled with self aggrandizement and titillation that they actually see this as a romantic fantasy?
Cold and reckless - coated in rose colored glasses.

975833,5,6305128952,"This is one of my favorite films. I consider it ""movie therapy""; I love the character of Tom, played by Robert Redford in that
he is the voice of wisdom, healing, and tough love with Pilgrim and Grace. The work he does with the horse is to me a
metaphor for surrender, how the horse has to ""accept what is"". The scene when he does this with Pilgrim and the horse
surrenders to the ground to rise up with Grace on his back is one of the most beautiful scenes I have ever seen. The
book was equally as powerful. Lovely sincere performances by the whole cast.",1431302400,,556,4.205607476635514

976004,5,6305128952,"The Horse Whisperer (1998) is a drama with Western elements starring Kristin Scott Thomas as Annie, a workaholic magazine editor from the Big Apple, who takes her troubled daughter (Scarlett Johansson) and horse across the country for succor after a horrible tragedy. Can Montanan horse expert Tom Booker (Robert Redford) help them? Sam Neill is on hand as Annies husband in an aloof marriage.

This is an outstanding drama that proves that ordinary life conveyed effectively is more engaging than the most overblown CGI-laden blockbuster with constant ""exciting"" things going on. Those types of movies have their place, of course, but they're usually only good when they include elements of ordinary life in which the viewer can relate (2009s Star Trek and 2013s Star Trek Into Darkness are good examples). As my title blurb points out, The Horse Whisperer is so potent it's a veritable spiritual experience (which Ill explain momentarily); you just have to be in the right mode for a long drama.

One critic said Annie (Scott Thomans) and Tom (Redford) lack chemistry. Poppycock. Do you think director Redford would even do the film without the right actress in the starring role, an actress he had great chemistry with? Besides, the film itself proves this criticism wrong: Theres a barn dance sequence late in the film that builds-up to a dance scene. Tom and Annie look deeply at each other from across the room until they ultimately come together, while still looking into each others eyes. This is EXACTLY how a man and woman look at one another when they love each other. The film expertly captures this intangible element.

Despite the above scene, The Horse Whisperer doesnt play like a steamy romance novel at all (not that Ive ever read one, lol). Redford was 61 during filming and looks it, even though he definitely looked good for his age (Scott Thomas was 36-37, by the way). As such, the love elements are decidedly low-key  a look, a touch, a word  elements that slowly build over the course of the story. Im not going to say any more or give away the ending, but it concludes the way it had to  excellent job on this front.

Johansson does a great job, particularly considering she was only 12 during filming. It goes without saying, don't expect the voluptuous young woman she would soon blossom into for 2002s Eight Legged Freaks or 2003s awesome Lost in Translation.

Why do I call The Horse Whisperer a veritable spiritual experience? Because everything about it works to produce this effect  the story, the music, the cinematography, the locations  and maybe especially because its a film about healing. Both Grace (Scarlett) and the horse desperately need healing, but so do Annie and her marriage; and I think maybe even Tom Booker.

I don't know how else to describe The Horse Whisperer except to say that its just a beautiful film and easily one of the greatest dramas ever made. If you love great films like Grand Canyon (1991), The Green Mile (1999), Whale Rider (2002) and Dances With Wolves (1990) you will also love this one. The Horse Whisperer shares qualities of these excellent movies, but is unique.

To close, Id like to share a powerful scene from late in the film (you might not want to read further if you haven't seen the movie, but its only a mild spoiler at best): Booker tells Grace about this Blackfoot boy whom he was friends with and who became a paraplegic after an accident. Tom would visit him now and then, but the spirited boy he once knew was gone. It was as if he just went somewhere else. Grace responds, I know where he goes.

The film runs 2 hours and 49 minutes and was shot on location in New York and Montana.

The movie is visually beautiful and emotional.  City dwellers rarely see landscapes like this. Your heart becomes as mangled as the horse Pilgrim is by an 18 wheeler truck. He has no choice but to go on living despite his injuries. You begin to comprehend that animals and human beings experience PTSD in the aftermath of severe physical and mental violence. It's not something we can discount or rush past because the world is spinning by faster. The movie teaches us about intuition and compassion.
There are glimpses into ranching work and life. The whole community participates and goes toward a common goal.  The lifestyle is normal paced and less subjected to sensationalism. Country life is physical and not lived out in front of a television.  You can almost smell the clean air and feel an uninterrupted breeze on your skin. All you can hear is nature; your psyche is not assaulted with planes, trains & automobiles.  I love this movie, the story and the characters in it.

976961,5,6305128952,"Worth seeing over and over again! This movie is perfect for any audience, young or old. It is not just a movie for horse lovers. Yes, it does involve a very special horse and his relationship with a young girl. This movie goes far beyond the usual fare of horse crazy girls and delves into the trauma of death, loss, regret, illness, body image, separation and relationships. Don't mistake this movie as just another drama that is depressing for it is far from depressing. This movie will lift your spirits and refresh your soul. The acting is spectacular and the characters quite believable. Whether you are young or old, single or married, you will find that you will grab more than one Kleenex and sniff a few times as the story tugs at your heart strings. I rarely purchase a movie to watch more than once and I added this to my collection. I decided to watch this again after watching the movie 'Buck' who was the inspiration for this movie. I also have ordered the novel from Amazon Prime. In case you are wondering if I own and love a horse, yep, I do. This movie is about love of life and having the courage to start over. It is never too late to decide to live the life you love!",1410480000,,1188,4.3558558558558556

976967,5,6305128952,"This movie has been one of my all time favorites since I first saw it as a kid. I remember first watching it on TV in my parents bedroom when they would watch movies. Ever since then I had always wondered if there was anyone such as a ""horse whisperer"" and if there was would I ever get to meet him. About 15 years later after seeing the movie I got in to horses and found out that even though that the movie is fictional, there is someone who Robert Redford's character in the movie took on. The guy didn't mean to play a huge role but he did. That man is named ""Buck Brannaman"" and this movie is NOT based on him at all. But, how Redford portrayed the character's state with horses and humans was well done. Even though this movie was made in the late 90's it's still one of the best.",1409875200,,786,4.077419354838709

...he coulda snagged Scarlet for his harlot!! Perfect amalgamation of Montana wilderness, horse training, and healin' at a squealin' fast pace! I have some experience with horses, primarily in Virginia, Main Line Philadelphia, etc., but this film is an extreme misrepresentation of their interaction, characteristics and personality. ""They Shoot Horses Don't They?"" more aptly aspires to a realistic film concept of humane treatment. I expected more from the man of western lore, who truly is a major bore.

Animals are amazing creatures that elevate the human experience and those who interact with them at any level could not possibly sit through this movie unless at gun point.

Thank you for Sundance, Butch, and most especially Paul in ""Park"", but call it a day my friend, stick with your day job...sigh.",1409788800,,851,5.197080291970803
977083,3,6305128952,"Of course, Robert Redford's is very good in this film. Scarlett Johansson is pretty good, too, for her break out role. I've seen this movie a couple times before I finally bought it (it was cheap). What I didn't realize the first couple times but did this time after I received this disc is, Kristin Scott Thomas isn't that good of an actor. I guess it's the English accent that makes people assume an actor is good. The horse is a better actor than she is.
The only other problem i have with this movie (and others like it) is how they portray people falling in love. I don't get how these two characters fall in love through their interactions with each other. They're only together a short while. They don't actually do anything together, other than a horse ride or two and a few serious talks about his previous love, and ""poof"" - they're in love.
They use at least two different horses in this film.  I noticed the white spot on the horse's nose is different throughout the movie.
It's an entertaining film about a horse and a guy. But it's not much else.",1409529600,2,1060,4.408163265306122

977324,4,6305128952,"This was a very entertaining and enjoyable movie. We anticipated viewing this movie, because we love horses, and this was a very intriguing movie from start to finish. Robert Redford is at his best in acting performance, and Kristen Scott Thomas was also superb throughout as the mom of her injured, disabled daughter after a tragic accident, which also injured her daughter's horse very badly.

The injured, young girl who lost her leg due to the accident, wants nothing more than to heal her wounded horse. The mom, daughter, and horse set out from the city to the country as the mom practically begs Robert Redford to heal the horse, because he is known as 'The Horse Whisperer.' He agrees to help the horse as both horse and the young girl who loves him, begin to slowly heal after session-after-session with training from Robert Redford.

The movie is filled with Strength, and Grace. It is captivating, emotional, and powerfully moving as it tugs at the heart. Very enjoyable film, especially for horse lovers. A beautiful, extraordinary story about courage, and love. Highly recommended.",1405296000,2,1094,4.972677595628415

The acting was suburb, the story line excellent without the need for ""trash talk"" or car wrecks or any of the so called sex scenes that todays pictures seem to need to fulfill what they think the audiences need or want.

Never having been to Montana, the scenic views were beautiful although I know the winters in that part of the country can be brutal, but  I was so torn between wanting Annie to stay with Tom or return to her husband Robert that I didn't  know what I wanted.

It took a long 2 hours and 50 minutes for me to confirm that this was a story to glorify Robert Redford, with the horse aspect coming in a distant second.  I watched this because I'm a big fan of wholesome storytelling involving horses, and would not rate it anywhere near the top in that category.  I don't seek out horse movies to be reminded of the moral bankrupcy of modern America, where the commitment of marriage is only honored when it's convenient.  A scene near the end is telling as the camera zooms out soon after the young girl is able to ride her horse again.

As an 'extreme horselover' I enjoyed the movie on that level, but found that the romantic interests were a little unbelievable, and the movie dragged in several areas...but I own it and will watch it again...the best movie ever, though, was THE ELECTRIC HORSEMAN!",1392508800,2,454,4.87012987012987

I was definitely more of a fan of Kristin Scott Thomas's character - a lady who did what she had to do but discovered she still had a heart. Too bad she and Robert Redford did not do a love scene, like in the book. Robert Redford is still fairly good-looking in this one.",1378339200,,483,4.551724137931035

The girl is told she has to help with the horse because she will be riding him.  But, evidently, not until the last day.  Then she walks with only one leg and no limping either.  Who is she--Jesus Christ?  The mother who has no time for anything or anyone except her career all of a sudden sacrifices it to take her daughter and the injured horse ""thousands of miles"" away?  I don't think so.  We see no care of the horse on the way.  How did she accomplish this when he is so wild she can't get near him? etc. etc. etc.  The language is condescending for the first half--so trite and predictable that I thought the movie was for young kids--until the romance scenes, which were definitely designed for the older population.  The movie comes off stupid.  I haven't read the book and don't intend to.  But this is a sad situation because the story line is good.  The presentation was rotten.

Robert Redford made us believe that he was a horse expert, and at the same time showed his human side by be tempted to be involved in a touching but illicit love affair.  The unrealistic part was the priority that the horse-owner's family placed on saving a physically and emotionally wounded horse at the expense of possibly breaking up a home, both financially and emotionally.

978736,5,6305128952,"How many times have I seen this movie? Four times, maybe. And it still fascinates me. Because ""Horse Whisperer"" tells more than one story and the stories told are being developed before a spell-bound audience via light, sound, scenery and script in a sensitive, yes even a compassionate way. In the beginning, there is tragedy, loss of life and a crippling accident that inflicts a horse and a girl, there is perceived guilt  -  by both the girl and the horse and, indirectly, as a 'collateral' damage, also by the girl's mother -  that entails a long road to redemption. On its way, it features the pilgrimage to the horse whisperer  - the true catalyst of the story of redemption -  a woman's hasty flight from her former life and into a romantic fly-by mission, a man on the verge of losing his family and an extended family in danger of losing its linchpin as well as its soul. It all comes rife with genuine emotion, thrill and suspense galore. Robert Redford, Kristin Scott-Thomas, Sam Neil, Scarlett Johansson develop the individual, tangled stories in the flesh most magnificently and in gripping fashion one by one. It is perhaps the most harmoniously acting cast of top performing mimes and directed by one of their own kind, Redford, in commensurate form.

On another note:
What has the studio done to the video of this movie? The first 33mins of the movie display a less than 1920 width image, the height is unaffected, it's not until one comes to that point in the movie that the image goes to *full width*.

I'm not sure why they needed a love interest between Robert Redford and Kristen Scott Thomas.  The movie could have survived quite nicely without that additional story line, maybe even better.  About 80% is worth watching, so you have to sit through the 20% that isn't so great.  It's worth it for the rest of the movie.

It works on multiple levels...first as a story about natural horsemanship techniques, or ""horse whispering"", as practiced by Buck Brannaman, who was the technical advisor for the film. Second, it is the story of a family in disarray after a terrible accident results in Grace, the young daughter, and her horse, Pilgrim, being severely injured. This is - my opinion - Robert Redford's best performance behind the camera; and he delivers a fine performance as Tom Booker...even making the romance between him and the much younger, Kristin Scott Thomas, believable. Thomas, as Annie, delivers her usual excellent performance. Perhaps the best performance is by a 14 year old Scarlett Johansson. as Grace...a difficult role for a mature adult; she pulls it off w/aplomb.",1359331200,,848,5.242647058823529

This scene is cut short and you never see the nuzzle.

Now as far as content, Monte Roberts will be the first to tell you that each horse is different and needs to be handled according to the horses feel and sometimes that feel will dictate that certain methods must be used to get across the full intent of what you want him to do, to include ropes, etc.  Even Roberts will tell you also that he doesn't know it all and will always be the continual student of the horse.  anyone that thinks they do know it all... well... enough said.",1355529600,,829,4.188679245283019

979864,4,6305128952,"In 1995, English author Nicholas Evans' novel, ""The Horse Whisperer"" was a best selling novel, selling over 15 million copies and becoming one of the best-selling books of all time.

While it was no surprise that a film adaptation would be made, it was more surprising to see actor Robert Redford not only star in the film but also direct it.

The film would receive good reviews and would make over $186 million in the box office.

VIDEO:

""The Horse Whisperer"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1) and features an all new digital restoration.

The overall transfer is definitely an upgrade over the previous DVD release. While slight layer of grain can be seen, there is a slight use of DNR as the film looks very clean and sometimes soft.  Fortunately, Touchstone Home Entertainment was able to find a balance and showcase the wonderful cinematography of Robert Richardson (""Shutter Island"", ""Inglourious Basterds"", ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1).  Some of the scenery shots, especially the vignette shots look fantastic in HD.

Overall, picture quality is very good and for those who owned the previous DVD release, will enjoy the HD upgrade.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The Horse Whisperer"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, French 5.1 and Spanish 2.0 Dolby Digital.  While the primary soundtrack is dialogue-driven through the center and front-channels, the musical score by Thomas Newman and Gwil Owen is fantastic and sounds amazing via lossless.  There are moments such as the accident or the horse kicking around that can be heard through the surround channels, but for the most part, the film's lossless soundtrack is center and front channel driven.

Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish

JUDGMENT CALL:

""The Horse Whisperer"" is a delightful and entertaining film showcasing a teenager and a horse that has faced amazing trauma and come to Montana under the help of a man with the special ability to help horses.

While long at 169 minutes, Robert Redford takes the audience and sets the pace of the challenge that exist between Grace and her mother Annie, a workaholic editor but also the sadness that she tries to keep inside after losing her right leg.

Robert Redford is fantastic as a director and actor in the film and it helps that Redford has amazing talent alongside with him.  Cinematographer Robert Richardson captures the beauty of Montana but also making sure the audience sees the interaction between the characters and the horses.  Along with the beautiful cinematography, the musical by Thomas Newman and Gwil Owen manages to capture the variety of emotions of the characters as Grace tries to get back to her life, while Annie and Tom develop a closer relationship.

And as Kristin Scott Thomas does a great job of playing a mother who is not sure about being a mother (but trying her best now after her daughter's injury) and discovering life outside of the big city, the film showed great promise at the time with  actress Scarlett Johansson.  Scarlett manages to capture a teenager who has suffered amazing physical and emotional trauma and Redford manages to bring out her acting with efficacy.

But while some people may feel the film is tool long and unnecessary, when I first watched this film many years ago and even now, I still feel the pacing of the film, to build upon character development was necessary and helped establish all three main characters.

The character of Tom is quite content of living in Montana, while Annie is often wondering how anyone can be so far from the city and not having major restaurants, shopping, etc.  As for Grace, she is emotionally withdrawn and her injury and how long it takes for her to put her trust in Tom and getting the courage to get close to Pilgrim takes time.  Even Pilgrim took some time in order to get used to being closed to Tom.  If anything, the horse trainers on set, did a wonderful job in making the horses react to the characters.

There is a romantic angle that involves Annie and Tom.  We know that Annie who was a workaholic had an unfulfilled marriage to Tom.  But as both she and Tom become more attracted towards each other, it's interesting to see how Tom's sister-in-law reacts to her.  She knows that Tom also needed some time to heal after the death of his wife and now with this amazing talent, the last thing she wants is her brother-in-law getting involved with a married woman.

As for the Blu-ray release, the same special features on the original DVD is included.  The upgrade featuring an all-new digital restoration is what should make fans of the film decide to upgrade to Blu-ray.  The film looks and sounds beautiful, but I know that videophiles wanting more grain and no DNR maybe disappointed but for those wanting clear picture quality, they should be thrilled by ""The Horse Whisperer"" being released in HD.

Overall, ""The Horse Whisperer"" is a touching film featuring a wonderful performance by Robert Redford, Kristin Scott Thomas and a younger Scarlett Johannson.  Also, featuring beautiful cinematography of the countryside and a beautiful musical score.  It is a long film, slowly paced but in the end, the film was enjoyable.

""The Horse Whisperer"" on Blu-ray is recommended!",1352332800,3,5980,4.9798183652875885

Years later I went looking for it, then remembered it was trashed. Over the years I only order movies from Amazon. In fact, I order almost everything from Amazon. This company is very efficient!!!!! When something goes wrong and I need to replace whatever it was, the staff is very professional and extremely pleasant.

In The Horse Whisperer case, I ordered the wrong dvd because of the ""state""# The gal walked me through the returns program and it went very well. Outside of clothes and jewelry, everything else comes from Amazon. Please............don't ever leave me.

979871,5,6305128952,"It seemed to be a struggle for director/star Robert Redford to get this fine film started since many studios passed on it, until the Disney people stated that they would finance it if Redford himself would star in it as well as direct.  Reluctantly Redford did star breaking his cardinal rule that it would be hard to direct and star in the same time--but as luck would have it, the film was a success despite the long shooting schedule.  One of the things I liked about this film is Redford's penchant for developing the character no matter it takes him---and that to me is one of the film's strengths.  Another is that he hired cinematographer Robert Richardson (JFK;Casino) to develop some awestriking visuals, because this film is definitely a visual treat--and should be seen on a big screen.  The Blu-ray edition, though, is excellent and if you have a large HDTV like around 60"" or 65""--you'll definitely enjoy this film.  It's probably the most visual Redford film since ""Jeremiah Johnson"" which I also just purchased recently in Blu-ray.  This is also the film debut of a very young Scarlett Johanson who received raves for her role as the damaged daughter.",1342310400,5,1166,4.805
979872,5,6305128952,"I got this yesterday and watched it last night with my wife, one of her favorite Robert Redford movies. First off let me say that the DTS-MA audio was great, the surround sound when implemented was enveloping and the Thomas Newman score was presented nicely. About the first 40 minutes was presented in a box style (1:85:1), borders all around to convey (I guess) life in the city. Once the movie begins the move out to Montana the picture opens up to the more satisfying 2:39:1 aspect ratio and the vistas are just marvelous to look at. Generally the film looks good and is a huge upgrade from the ugly non-anamorphic DVD released in the early days of DVD. However I would have to nitpit with the element used in the mastering of the Blu-ray even though the back cover claims an all-new digital restoration. While some scenes look quite sharp, others look out of focus or soft. Nonetheless we are happy to finally own it on Blu-ray. I hate the cover art but understand why they felt it necessary to photoshop Redford's bust into the artwork. The extras are very brief (each lasting a few minutes) and are in SD. Finally, I did not see this film in the theater so I do not know if the inclusion of a new scene in the Blu-ray version was in the original or not.

980027,5,6305128952,"The person that provided the horse training and coaching of the star, Robert Redford in his horse handling for the movie, was Buck Brannaman.

Ray Hunt was one of Tom's better know students and Tom of course is the man (or godfather) who developed the kinder, gentler methods of training the horse widely known today as ""Natural Horsemanship"" practiced by many well known clinicians. Although the movie is about the problems of a young girl and her injured horse, along with elements of human trials, issues and frustrations, the kind approach to dealing with the mental and physical issues of the horse come through very clearly. It gives some insight to how trust, respect, love and bonding can be achieved in both animals and humans with a focused kind and gentle method.",1331856000,,938,4.796296296296297

980255,1,6305128952,"Lousy excuse for a horse movie.  It's not.  It's another in a long line of Redford romances.  And not even a good or believable one, at that!

I saw it on tv and was angry enough to come to Amazon and check out the reviews.  Those who gave it high praise and 3, 4, and even 5(!!) stars certainly saw more to it than I did.  I thought I was going to see a story about the healing of a horrifically traumatized horse, by the horse whisperer.

But sadly, and to my anger, the horse is only used as the ""hook"" to get you to watch, and an excuse to bring Redford and Scott Thomas together.  Only a few minutes of the whole movie is devoted to the healing of the horse.  The rest of it is devoted to the romance.  The horse is forgotten, and only finally, at the end, miraculously, healed.  We don't get to see the actual method, or the interaction between horse and healer for more than a few minutes, because, sadly, that's not what the movie's about.  The poor horse is only incidental to a laughable ""romance"" between a very young Scott Thomas and a very old Redford.

I had decided after watching ""A River Runs Through it"" to never again watch a Redford movie.  I should have stuck to that.

If you like Redford romances, go for it.  But don't buy this thinking you're going to watch a moving story about a horse.  It's a movie about the horse whisperer-(Redford)-get it?",1318032000,9,1370,4.2684824902723735
980256,3,6305128952,"Years ago I read the book about the life of Monty Roberts, The man who listens to horses, a real life horse whisperer, and it is fantastic. When my husband brought home this film I was hoping it would be based on his life or his methods. Robert's gift is the knowledge that gentling and gaining the trust of the horse is all about the listening, not the talking even if it is a whisper.

This film, which is another story entirely, starts of with one of the most incredible opening scenes ever. Also, the relationships between the teen and her horse, girlfriend, and mother are all very real.

Unfortunately, the whole horse whispering plot was not nearly so strong. Redford did not seem to have a genuine relationship with any of his own horses, in fact none even seemed to have names. Whereas Monty, a real horse whisperer, always brought a presence of calm and confidence to horses, often Redford agitated the horse star Pilgrim using more of ""tough love"" methods making observers including the teen girl have to shade eyes and look away. At one point Redford ties one of the horses legs and brings him to the ground in dog- like submission, a very unnatural, terrifying position for a horse. It made me remember one of the methods Monty's SOB father would use to break his horses, and one Monty found entirely unnecessary and harmful to a horses spirit.

If you are an animal lover looking for a film for insights on animal human relationships, look elsewhere. If you are a Robert Redford fan and enjoy scenic movies with spectacular filming, you may want to give it a try.",1317600000,4,1577,4.585106382978723

980612,5,6305128952,"I had the pleasure of viewing this movie projected on the big screen when it was first released, however, I was disappointed in the ending which diverges from the 1995 book by Nicholas Evans.  It has taken me a while to understand why director/star Robert Redford ended on a moral high note.  I believe he was trying to convey lessons he had learned from mistakes he made in his personal life.

Panned for its length, happily the leisurely pace of The Horse Whisperer is today a visual valentine to the breadth of our great country, from snowy New England meadows to majestic thunderstorms in Western mountain ranges.  The movie has aged like a fine wine and I have to periodically uncant it to savor Redford's grace notes - the way Tom Booker (Redford) secures a missed button on Annie's (Kirstin Scott Thomas) dress; the various stations coming over the car radio during the journey west; the look on Grace's (Scarlett Johansson) face when she realizes she can drive; that one slow waltz between Annie and Tom which conveys more raw emotion than most torrid sex scenes.

What's not to like here?  No director has managed to elict a finer performance from Johansson; Kirstin Scott Thomas is at the peak of her beauty; Chris Cooper, Diane Weist and Sam Neill are all pitch perfect, heck even the little Booker boys are great.  Although the plot centers around a kind, wise and patient animal trainer who nurses a girl and her stallion back to health, the healer is only human and I believe he fell for Annie from the first time he laid eyes on her which adds the poignancy of this memorable movie.  Beware, the Horse Whisperer can make a girl yearn to live in Montana, and just remember, Tom Booker isn't there!",1245024000,,1711,4.642384105960265
980613,3,6305128952,"Here's a beautifully filmed ""horse opera"" about a New York teenage girl (Scarlett Johannsson, who is now a well-known actress but wasn't when this was made) and her horse, both of whom are badly injured in a mishap and are healed by a Montana horse expert, played by Robert Redford.

Redford also directed this film and being such an outdoorsman, you know this is going to show nature in a beautiful way....and it does. The Montana scenery is just awesome.

After a dramatic opening scene in which we see the horse and daughter hurt, the mother (Kristin Scott-Thonas) takes the girl and the horse out West to see if the horse can be salvaged. Unfortunately, the mother - who is married - falls for the horseman ""Tom Booker"" (Redford) and an adulterous relationship almost comes to fruition. That romance is the soap opera part of the film but it's nice to see everyone, including Redford's character, healed of emotional as well as physical wounds.

This film is a bit too much of a melodrama at times which makes it a long in spots, but it's a long movie to begin with (169 minutes). It's so beautifully filmed, however, that for that alone the movie is worth seeing.

980614,5,6305128952,"This is conceivably my favorite movie of all time, and definitely my favorite soundtrack.  There is so much more to this film than I've seen anyone write.  Sure it's a romance, horse, child loving horse, injured child (mentally and physically), horsey guy, etc. and whatever else you've read about this movie.  But what I'll attempt to write here is what you're not going to see anywhere else.

My personal favorite dynamic in human to human or human to animal relationships is the garnering of trust. And someone, or both, having that intuition to be such that they earn that trust. This is what you have in this movie.  Some spoilers may be involved here...

Kristen Scott Thomas' character is ill - on the fast track professionally and away from a quality marriage.  Some might call that success and indeed her character was so caught up in her life that she probably thought she was doing fine. Scarlette Johannson's character is ill as well - both physically and mentally from the accident and from a lack of true connection to her parents, especially her mother. The horse is, well, broken - physically, of course, but traumatized from the accident.

These three come to beautiful, clean and pristine (but not over-the-top gorgeous - as I've heard Redford say that he wanted the landscape to speak for itself -intrinsic beauty - not from the photography making it beautiful - paraphrased here) country and they meet Robert Redford's character. He is so peacefully understanding of what these other three are about - he takes stock of the mother (all New York of her), the horse (traumatized) and the girl (resistent and hurting).  He presents himself in such a way that he is totally non-threatening and they all, on their own levels, come to trust him...and they heal.

It is a movie about trust. There are prices to pay for that trust, for sure. Redford's character opens up in a way he never thought he would again but I like how this director ended the movie rather than how the book ended.  The book ending made no sense in the context of who the character was so I appreciate that Redford changed it. The mother pays a price for sure....the horse and the girl...well, they're healed and all is right with their world..

There are many levels on which to watch this movie - the photography is gorgeous, the horses, the way of life - all beautiful....the music, well, gorgeous and grandiose in parts....the characters multi-level....The husband (Sam Neill)is intelligent and shows he has a good understanding of how his marriage is and the changes his wife has gone through while with Redford. It's a tear-jerker for sure - I don't think as many times as I've watched this movie, that I haven't been crying at the end. But I hate to see it end....Enjoy this movie - I envy you the first time.",1242777600,,2802,4.707566462167689
980615,3,6305128952,"There's a message that Redford is trying to subtly get across. Redford is trying to convey that the most important things in life (and to mankind) are simple. Relax, love one another, live where you want, do what you want, and know that in spite of all of that, you can still be respected.

In a fast-paced America, we fight amongst each other for money, property, job status and damn near everything else. We even compete on the roads to see which one of us will arrive at the red light first!

As the film points out, we have no time for realtionships with our children or even time to make home-made spaghetti sauce.

This is such an insightful story about life, one's decisions about the things that should matter to us, and how relationships such as marriages often are not ""until death do us part"" but rather are stepping stones to future growth, or holding places for us until the time comes that we must decide to move on or forever stay stuck in mediocrity.

What a pity then that the hero who was doing such a good job of teaching then fails to teach the young girl that one must take responsibility for one's actions in life.  Instead he encourages her to go into denial and refuse to accept the fact that it was her own lack of maturity and good sense that damaged her for life.

Redford crossed over the traditional concessions and he got to prove art and cinema should not be divorced: good taste and profitability may gather and shake hands, if you respect the sensibility and intelligence of the spectator.

This picture not only broke the walls and not only became the most ambitious, artistic and perfect American film in the last quarter of Century; besides, the mature and sensitive script around an awful event that will transform the livings and expand the reduced frontiers of two different ways of life, enhancing them when the tragedy became an unexpected gate for the bliss.

Redford' s artistic personality has a secure place in the immortality and I really hope for him to bring us future films filled of that enriched vision where the rude vulgarity, the visible special effects big circus and the simple anecdote not only be absent; and so the new directors to come, understand the true cinema meaning is ART.

Kudos to Kristin Scott Thomas, Scarlett Johansson, and Chris Cooper for their great performances and especially to Robert Richardson for his breath-taking cinematography. Montana sure is purty.

Here's a fun game to play: try to find a single scene where Robert Redford's character, Tom Booker, is not dishing out advice. I found his constant borage of counsel quite tiresome. Toward the end of the film I was expecting him to promote his new book, ""Surviving Utter Rash"" or ""Branding: How I Learned to Trust My Rancher"" or ""Controlled Grazing: Bovine Eating Disorders and Weight Management"" If you like Dr. Phil you'll love The Horse Whisperer.",1143072000,3,812,5.136363636363637

Because of the length of the film, all her scenes were cut. I would love to see the deleted scenes of those on a DVD. Then maybe I would buy it.",1142985600,4,320,4.245901639344262
980941,5,6305128952,"To say that this movie is about the relationship between a little girl and her horse is a gross understatement. For the beautiful screen adaptation of Nicholas Evans' novel under Robert Redford's master direction is a soothing canticle for the spirit. A song of hope, that touches our hearts, as the minuscule and almost unnoticeable drop of rain does when kissing a flower's petal by the dying shadows of sunrise. This is a story that says that love is everpresent patience, particularly in those times when the object of our affection seems to be distant, or even lost. It is about falling into the dark abyss of hopelessness when we realize that for whatever reasons perhaps we have been taking for granted the very things that in the end, are the ones that keep us breathing. Or even learning, that sometimes we have to let go of certain things, for others to stay and blossom.

Grace Mc Lean (a very young Scarlett Johansson) has a terrible accident while riding her horse Pilgrim. As a result, Grace's best friend dies, and both Grace and Pilgrim are left with terrible physical and emotional injuries to endure. The terrible circumstances in which the McLeans are caught up into, begin to uncover the many cracks and emotional holes existing in the relationship between Robert and Annie (Grace's parents) most of them masterfully hidden under years of routine and probably under a comfortable carelessness. After the accident, young Grace starts to slide down into an abyss of emotional bitterness and frustration which is  endangering both her soul and spirit.

A confused Annie, will cling on to the hope that Pilgrim's recovery may also probably be a way to Grace's emotional healing, so she starts to research into the somewhat seclusive world of horses, finding out about Tom Booker (Robert Redford) a renowned ""horse whisperer"" with a special touch for troubled animals who lives out in the prairies of Montana. In a desperate move she sets out to the country to find Booker, along with a reluctant Grace and the sick horse in a trailer. During this trip to the unexpected, Annie will find herself confronting the harshness of her own frustrations and failures as a distant mother, perhaps more involved with her career than with her family, and also with the overwhelming sadness of a marriage and a love once new that, though still there, has now grown old and empty.

A shaken and vulnerable Annie and a lost and hurt Grace, will ultimately end up finding strength and purpose in Tom Booker's devotional dedication to Pilgrim's recovery. Somehow it seems that by -patiently yet strongly- taming Pilgrim and his scarred soul, Booker is taming his own spirit as well as Grace's and Annie's, so they all can come to accept those things they cannot change, while being brave enough to change those they can. The overwhelming presence of nature and the vast landscape will also make them discover the joy hidden in simple things as the blessings we all enjoy just merely for being alive. Eventually a love story unfolds between Annie and Tom but despite the strong feelings for each other, they realize that their coming together would eventually require them to sacrifice too much, so even loving each other, they ultimately choose to let each other go. In time, Pilgrim's progresses mean acceptance and fortitude and an unexpected maturity for the young Grace who slowly begins to overcome her tragedy with acceptance and courage. Ultimately she finds herself in peace with the burden that has been put over her young shoulders. When Annie, Grace and Pilgrim set back to NY they will physically seem to be returning back to their old lives, but is just obvious, that all of their lives have been changed forever. So they are not really returning, but beginning to travel a path to someplace totally new.

The scenery, the marvelous natural landscapes, the photography are just spectacular. Simply beyond words. The music provides a perfect background to the movie and the original soundtrack by Thomas Newman including moving pieces like ""The vast continent"", ""Angus"", ""Your misfortune -none of my own"", ""Pilgrim's progress""... is out of this world, being one of my favorites ever and by far one of the most beautiful scores I have ever listened. A special mention has to be made of Robert Redford, whose job as a director was (from my humble point of view) totally overlooked and underestimated by the Oscars. Being the beautiful movie that this is, I will never understand how the Academy ignored it so dramatically in all Oscar categories.",1141516800,8,4555,4.91038961038961
980942,5,6305128952,"For any one who is interested in the animal/human spirit connection, this is a film you mustn't miss. Robert Redford's direction of 'The Horse Whisperer' is a triumph. A deeply emotionally touching film, in which Redford also stars,it offers stunning scenery and cinematography as well as many beautiful layers of metaphor, symbology and juxtaposition. It's a film which explores themes of redemption and healing. Healing of both the human and animal spirit as well as the healing of broken relationships and families.
Grace's broken body and spirit (The result of a devastating riding accident, resulting in her best friends death) as well as her troubled relationship with Mother 'Annie',are beautifully juxtaposed with that of her badly injured and traumatised, beloved horse Pilgrim. The failing marriage of her parents,contributing further to the disconnection of the family unit, also adds another interesting layer to the film and plot.
Enter 'Tom Booker' reluctantly persuaded out of semi-retirement by the persistant Annie as the especially skilled and gifted horse trainer/healer (or 'Horse Whisperer' as legend has it), and who also becomes the catalyst in the bridging of the gaps between each member of this family in crisis.  Their time spent away from New York in the beautiful natural 'Montanna' setting with Booker(and family),along with Pilgrim's difficult and gradual journey back through Bookers 'healing ways', gives Grace the faith, confidence and inspiration she herself needs to regain her strength of spirit and will to overcome her physical obstacle. It also helps in offering a way for Mother and daughter to reconnect. Through Grace's traumatic accident and away from her familiar enviroment Annie's character is forced to re-think her life as the previously workaholic and somewhat controlling absent parent. The attraction and connection between Tom Booker and Annie obviously adds the obligatory Romantic interest, but more importantly it provides the final turning point for Annie's character, when she is forced to make a choice between her own quest for personal happiness and what is ultimately best for her daughter.
Kristen Scott Thomas (Annie) and a very young Scarlett Johansson (Grace) are superb in their roles. Sam Neill plays his small supporting role as the husband and Father, nicely and an although aging 'Robert Redford' is still convincing and ruggedly charimastic as Booker. The real star of this film however is Redford's direction and camera team. The film is so visually powerful; full of both subtle nuances and dramatic contrasts of light,darkness,sound and setting. Be warned there are some confronting scenes. As an animal lover I admit I found the graphically dramatic depiction of the horsing accident and Pilgrim's terror and suffering, quite unsettling and difficult to watch. The breathtaking Montanna scenery is a welcoming escape and contrast from the dark, synthetic and repressive New York City scenes. When Grace and Annie set off on their rambling long journey across mid-north America with horse in tow, the mood becomes one full of hope and adventure. Gradually too the characters regain hope and strength through this adventure and long journey of the human soul. In a sense they are reborn; revived by nature and the deep bond which exists between animal and human. That is ultimately what moved me the most about this story.
The critics as I remember didn't give this film its due when it came out. Many fobbed it off as some sort of sentimental, contrived 'Robert Redford Vehicle'. Far from it. It is an exceptionally well acted, well crafted, deeply moving and inspiring story and movie experience.",1136332800,11,3672,5.298456260720411

Much of the character development, sub-themes, plot sequence and even dialogue is thinly disguised rehash of Redford's earlier movie ""The Electric Horseman"". ""TEH"" was good, or at least Fun, because it was fresh. But repackaging a lot of it to make ""The Horse Whisperer"" turned it into refried beans. ""Whisperer"" is even worse because quite a bit of the main plot simply defies all credibility. The supposed epiphaney of the unconvincing ""family' is so hokey and disingenious it should have somehow been filmed in crayon, not Technicolor. It did as well as it did at the box office for only four reasons. It had a large promotional budget, it had Redford's name attached, it had the word ""horse"" in the title, and there are plenty of garage sale addicts here. Get ""City Slickers"" instead.

981093,5,6305128952,"A very fine film, maybe a little bit slow at times due to the desire to capture the very special rhythm of Montana. The story of a New York girl and her horse taken up in the trauma of an accident. The horse has become wild and the girl has lost a leg and finds it difficult to cope, what's more she culpabilizes the accident and the sore fate of the horse. So far nothing special. The mother is a magazine editor and she decides to take the situation in her own hands and to look for help from a rancher in Montana who is known as having very special contact with horses. He is the horse whisperer. In other words he is a horse psychologist. She drops her responsibilities and drives there with the horse and her daughter. It is then the story of the recovery of the horse and of the girl in the hands of that man. Patience, contact, even when necessary some force on the horse and some authority on the girl. The mother and the daughter integrate the ranch and discover a completely different life and rhythm : to live in nature, with animals and raise them. We try to forget that it is only to produce meat. The scenery is grandiose and the absence of any distraction makes the mother and the daughter concentrate on themselves, and regenerate their life energy. Just this adventure is strong anough to be fascinating. It also reveals that these ranchers, who are extremely satisfied in this life, have a past experience of the city (Chicago for instance), of cultural entertainments (classical music for instance) and are not completely cut off from life due to television. But this life also provides children with early activities and responsibilities and makes them grow a lot faster, not so much in their bodies but in their minds and psyches. They are able to cope with life at the age of twelve. This is an amazing education that has to be contrasted with the childish and infantilizing education we provide most kids in our schools. Of course a love, not affair, but adventure develops between the mother and the horse whisperer : change, a completely new universe, the discovery of feelings that are of a new nature. The attitudes of these two and the father that rejoins them at the end are surprising in many ways : the freedom granted by the father to his wife, the responsibility of the mother who will in the end return to New York, and the deepfelt passion of the mother and the horse whisperer that will be dominated and kept human and humane, a passion of the soul which will make it a lot more difficult to break, and yet which will remain totally controled by the mind. No abandon, no reckless delving into it, just accepting it and keeping it within the limits of a humane vision which takes into accounts the interest of others and not only the selfish desires of the lovers. Love becomes then a mental and cultural blending of feelings and experiences. It can be brought to an end but it will always live and survive. The film is extremely moral in a way and tries to show that natural living conditions do not produce uncensored impulses, far from it. To go back to nature builds a deeper moral and ethical approach to life. Some will say that is a myth. Right they are. Some will say that is a dream. Right they are. Some will say that is an illusion. Right they are. But it is something that does exist and that shows human beings are definitely not animals.

981094,5,6305128952,"I agree with all the glorious things said about the film-making - the panorama of the landscapes, the story of the injured horse and the 'wounded' child, and also the romantic subplot.

I am writing here with the singular purpose, however, of suggesting that viewers be prepared for a very, very startling beginning. The accident is graphic enough to upset, but I feel that advance notice may help the sensitive or the young to prepare for it or to have a viewing buddy preview it and maybe 'edit' for them.

Aside from that brief sequence, the rest is wonderful.",1097452800,6,563,4.6767676767676765
981095,5,6305128952,"Many have already addressed the plot of this film, so I will not not go into detail. However, I feel compelled to touch upon the visual storytelling in this film.

Movies are first and foremost imagery. As many legendary filmmakers have said, a good film can be watched with the sound turned off and still communicate every bit of the story and emotion through the images alone. This includes cinematography but goes light years beyond lighting and framing a scene. Each shot must be planned and designed, from sets to props to location scouting, from blocking the actors' movements to using color and shapes, textures, and spatial relationships. All these must communicate the text and subtext simultaneously.

I said all that to say this: Redford and his team blew me away with ""The Horse Whisperer."" The first act alone is filled with enough information in every corner of the screen to chew on for days. One example among dozens is the use of symmetry, parallel lines, and perpendicularity in the city scenes - even in the arrangement of books in the background, pens on a desk, or the window blinds in a hospital - to convey the superficially ordered control of Anne's life. This is contrasted with the organic sweeping curves of the farm landscapes where Grace's accident occurs. The confined spaces and straight streets of New York are gradually and gracefully replaced with the curves of the highways as Anne drives west until she reaches the Rockies in all their chaotically ingenious immensity.

And apart from all this, I was also deeply effected emotionally by this movie. Yes, it takes its time telling the story. But such stories in our own lives take time to unfold. And real, subtle moments deserve as much time to play out as they need. Grace's recovery from the death of her friend and the injuries to the body and spirit of herself and her faithful horse Pilgrim are also expertly crafted. It has personal resonance in my family because we faced many of the same trials and frustrations when my wife was injured by a tornado a year after we married. She was touched and encouraged by this film.

Thomas Newman's score is his masterwork. It brought me to tears during the end credits.

Grace is also perfectly portrayed by the then-unknown Scarlett Johansson. Most people seem to forget she was in ""The Horse Whisperer,"" but I will always associate this film with Scarlett and her with it.",1092960000,69,2407,4.790361445783133
981096,1,6305128952,"First off, I'm an avid reader.  I read this book shortly before I heard about the movie coming out and I loved it.  I couldn't put it down & cried through the last chapter.  Now, to clarify...I'm not one of those weepy women who cries over hallmark comercials & other such drivel.  It takes a lot to make me shed a tear.  That said, I got so into the book that I couldn't help feel the pain the characters were going through.
When the movie came out, I went to the theatre to watch it...excited about seeing it all come to life before me.  I know better than this b/c rarely are movies as good as the books, but still I hoped for the best.  It was beautiful.  I'll give it that...but it was slow.  I felt every mile of the drive from NY to Montana.  Besides being bored through most of the movie, I got more & more angry as I realized just how little respect was paid to the book with the screenplay.  The characters weren't the ones that I had fallen in love with...or in the same respect hated.  They were just kinda emotionless, middle of the road representations of the characters that Nicholas Evans created.  Then...somewhere along the line, I'm guessing the screenplay writer decided that the book that they had bought the rights to wasn't good enough so they took the liberty to omit the last 4th of the book & reinvent their own Hollywoodized ending.  As a reader and a Nicholas Evans fan, I couldn't help but feel that they butchered his work.
BUT, if you like long, slow, movies and have never read & don't intend to read the book...go right ahead and see this movie.  You just might like it.  Scarlett Johanssen is good and the scenery is beautiful.",1088812800,12,1661,4.361563517915309

981245,4,6305128952,"This is a richly acted and beautifully photographed film about wounded psyches of both the human and animal kind. The disturbing horse/vehicle accident at the beginning of the film is realistic and even painful to watch but is essential in establishing the depth of the emotional torment that followed in its tragic and inevitable wake. Physically maimed for life, young Grace MacLean had a great deal of physical and emotional healing in her immediate future. I cannot say enough about the superb acting of young Scarlett Johansson in bringing a certain depth and sensitivity to this demanding role. She was simply brilliant in a quiet and understated way. Both Grace and her beloved horse ""Pilgrim"" who narrowly avoided being put down as a result of his awful trauma injuries are both destined to begin a slow emotional healing process even more painful than the setting of mere bone and scarred flesh. The restorative process leads Grace's high achieving mother Annie (Kristin Scott-Thomas) to take Grace and Pilgrim on a cross country motor journey to distant Montana to seek out the services of noted ""horse whisperer"" Tom Booker.  Robert Redford was at his acting best in this role and in a minimalist way he quietly defined a serene and hard working rancher whose unique gift was an almost otherworldly understanding of animals.  Annie had personal issues of her own to deal with that transcended the focus of the trip and she too had to sort through a complex stew of emotional feelings laid bare as a result of the experience. As the process of healing plays itself out over time at the Booker ranch, all too human emotional baggage attached to everyone involved is inevitably exposed, aided no doubt by a close and personal proximity. This is where Redford positively shined as director. He never forced issues, always allowing individual moments of epiphany to unfold in a naturally relaxed way. The film ends in a bittersweet but profoundly sober manner, not unlike the way life often unfolds for those with holes in their heart. Bring a handkerchief to this one, you'll not be disappointed. Whether you shed a tear of joy or sorrow matters not. You'll be richer for the experience.",1073001600,4,2194,4.927027027027027
981246,3,6305128952,"I'm a sucker for a Robert Redford film and after watching the Horse Whisperer I cannot think of any other actor who could have played the lead role better.
The film starts off innocently enough with two young girls Judith and Grace (played by excellent new actreess Scarlett Johansson) taking a horseback ride in the snow.  There's a terrible accident in which Judith dies, Grace is crippled and Grace's horse is injured.  The tragedy destroys both the horse's and Grace's trust and self-esteem.
Grace's mother, a busy magazine editor, eventually decides to take her daughter and horse to Tom Booker, the Horse Whisperer (Redford), in Montana.  Tom's reluctant to help out but eventually gives in.  Over time and away from the bustle of the big city the family starts to heal.  Additonally, grace's mother gains a new perspective on life from Tom and ends up falling in love with him.
Despite being a long film it doesn't really get into the details of what horse whispering is, explain the troubled relationship between mother and father, or devle into why Tom falls in love with the mother (what was so great about her?)

This is a great movie if you have interest in children or animals and righting a wrong.  Redford takes a mentally and physically damaged horse and is asked to magically cure it.  But it's really the humans that need the help and Redford eventually works his magic on the daughter.

Starring in this romance drama are Robert Redford and Kristin Scott Thomas.  As the movie takes us from New York City across country to the open skies of Montana we see scenery unsurpassed by any other film of the year.  You can almost spell the mountain air as we travel through the rolling hills of a working Montana cattle ranch.  The Academy award nominated sound track adds the finishing touch.
 We share in Annie MacLean's (Thomas) heartbreak when her daughter is involved in a tragic horseback riding accident.  Thomas now has to overcome a stressed marriage and rebuild a relationship with her daughter.  To do this, Thomas must help her daughter and her horse that was equally traumatized by the accident heal.  Showing her domineering attitude Thomas decides against everyone's wishes to travel across country with her daughter and the horse to find the ""Horse Whisperer"".
 Once there, not only does Thomas find help for her daughter and horse, she also finds love.  We see Tom Booker's (Redford) caring touch reach everyone around him.  As the daughter and horse heal we see Thomas's situation become more difficult.

The story centers on a high powered Manattan magazine editor (Kristen Scott-Thomas) and her family. Her daughter becomes involved in a very serious accident with her horse, which results in the loss of one of her legs, the death of her best friend, and severe emotional and physical injury to her beloved horse. Several months later, her mother, at her wits end with her daughter's emotional state, drives the daughter and the horse out to Montana to visit a Horse Whisperer (Robert Redford), a man who can heal the most severely wounded creatures.
Of course, it is not just the horse or the daughter who need to be healed, but Scott-Thomas's character as well. However, the movie never verges on the maudlin and instead treats all of its characters and their issues with respect. The cinematography is gorgeous. Every time I see this movie, I want to get into my car and drive out to Montana.
I would recommend this movie to moviegoers who enjoy serious, modern stories. There is a strong romantic undercurrent to the story (inevitable with Redford in the lead) but it does not overwhelm the movie.

981254,5,6305128952,"Almost from the first scene there is enormous tension in this movie. The smashed innocence of youth, the imperious maneuvering of an overbearing mother/executive - executive/mother, and the seemingly willing doormat of a husband are all played against the shadow of a horribly injured horse, which for a time are the only wounds the players really acknowledge. It's easy to get involved in the plight of Pilgrim, the horse, but as the story progresses, it becomes clear that the horse's injuries are small potatoes compared to the injuries shouldered and nurtured by Scott Thomas (the mother) and her daughter - as well as Redford (the Whisperer), although I didn't piece that together until I'd watched it a second time.
Redford and Scott Thomas are at the top of their game (I'm not much of a Redford fan and I'm only beginning to appreciate what a gem Scott Thomas is), and although Horse Whisperer subtly leads the viewer astray for a time, deliberately focusing on the injuries to the horse and the daughter, about 45min in to the movie you can sense real intrigue developing between Redford and Scott Thomas. Redford plays the strong, semi-silent Marlboro man (masking his own injuries behind a thick veneer of quiet competence), and Scott Thomas transports her restless world of conference-calls, cell phones, fax machines and overworked anxiety to the Big Sky meadows of Montana. It takes days, weeks, for her to recognize the incongruity; however, eventually the recognizes the quiet value hidden in ranch life, and when she does, Scott Thomas sheds her urban values in a rush - for a time.
I've enjoyed this movie several times - one of the few times I agree with the professional critics. Super! A must watch. Not really a ""feel good"" movie, but Horse Whisperer is a thoughtful ""reality check"" that leaves the viewer (or at least me), playing all sorts of woulda, coulda, shoulda mind games.",1031011200,3,1902,4.928348909657321

981441,4,6305128952,"The movie received mixed reviews during its theatrical run so I did not bother to see it.  When I finally saw it on DVD, I have to say that this movie is very un-Hollywood.  Mr. Redford as a filmmaker and a conservationist, made an ode to Montana sky and the ranch horses that rule the land.  Regardless you love horses or the country scenery or not (me being a big city kind of girl), you will feel the love and care Mr. Redford lavished on his favorite subjects.

The horse Pilgrim, after his devastating accident, is heartbreakingly portrayed.  There's nothing fun about seeing an emotionally and physically wounded animal struggling to adjust and to deal.  I've never been big on horses but it breaks my heart to see it on film.  Same can be said about the character Grace, the way she had to deal with being a teenager and an amputee at the same time.  It's a lot for either of them to handle.  The emotional roughness portrayed by them in a parallel way was very hard to take while watching it.

As for the ending, if you really listened to Sam Neil's speech to Miss Scott Thomas (his wife in the movie), you'd realize why she makes the decision she made.  It's not an easy task for a middle-aged woman to decide on choosing the passion of the moment or choosing the long-standing support of a devoted husband.

This movie and its pace are for audience who appreciate details, subtle emotions, natural settings, simplicities, and animals.  If Pearle Harbor and Con Air were your kind of movies (not that there's anything wrong with them), you may not want to sit through this one.  :)",1018915200,4,1590,4.513986013986014
981442,4,6305128952,"Overall, this is a lovely, heartwarming movie.  The Montana scenery is beautiful, though overly used.  The movie is nearly 2 and a half hours long -- it could have been cut to under two hours had they not spent so much time with the sweeping scenic shots.  Robert Redford is perfectly cast as Tom Booker, The Horse Whisperer... though he seems to be ""going through the motions"" and not giving too much depth to his character.  That seems to be the problem with all the characters... not enough depth to them.  The story is well done, though clumsy at points.  The story is that of a girl who has an accident with her horse, causing the horse to become unstable and causing her to lose her leg.  So, the mother (Kristin Scott Thomas) takes her and the horse to see The Horse Whisperer.  The character of the mother is by far the most prominent character -- though I think the film should have focused more on the girl and the horse.  The problem is that the really worthwhile scenes with the girl and the horse seem to be overshadowed by the mother and her own problems.  Most of the movie is spent focused on the mother.  Generally speaking, there just isn't enough meat to this film -- not enough depth to the characters.  I won't deny that it is very nice and worth seeing -- I gave it four stars because it is basically good.

Cried for the beauty and depth that Robert Redford portrayed so strongly. I could identify with its' message of healing and the longing to feel connected with the land and with family. It so greatly captures what has been lost in our modern society....a yearning that is in all of us to find ""a soft place to fall"". I praise Redford for giving me a reason to feel and ache for all that is good and peaceful in the world and for reminding us that such places do indeed still exsist.",1002844800,2,612,4.194915254237288
981603,2,6305128952,"Considered solely on its merits as a film, this thing borders on the pathetic. The one redeeming feature is the horse's performance and the cameraman who captured it for us. That horse really worked for his hay. Watching Pilgrim reminds us of Lee Marvin's comment on receiving an Academy Award for Cat Ballou: ""this really belongs to a horse somewhere in Nevada"". While this is supposed to be a story about people, Redford as director couldn't avoid the clich of scenes of sweeping vistas, pleasing to watch but contributing nothing to an already thin plot. This isn't a film about frontier development, it's supposed to be about a horse shrink confronted by an Eastern ""modern woman."" Why couldn't Redford provide some urban shots for contrast?

We must be fair to Robert Redford. Converting the worst novel of the past generation to film took courage and talent. Redford has these aplenty, but the source material inevitably undercut even his abilities. Evans' unique version of a Harlequin Romance was designed for the screen - simplistic, implausible and meritless. The only thing positive here is that Redford translated Evans' characters into film without a hitch. Easily done since the only one with any depth is [again] the horse. Redford simply plays himself in the role Tom Booker. His opening scenes are nearly all mute, but Redford can pull that off with his piercing gaze. He personifies the laconic solitary rancher with ease. Regrettably, Evans' story forces Booker to fall for Anne MacLean, a woman with no redeeming characteristics whatsoever. Neither book nor film provided a shred of motive for this bizarre romance, we are simply presented the situation in text and scene as if perfectly natural. Thomas, as MacLean, conveys the self-centred, amoral and predatory publishing executive almost flawlessly. She blithely enters the affair with no shred of conscience for her betrayed husband, Sam Neill. What is the motivation for this marital treason? Sam couldn't do his job from Montana? We never find out just what made MacLean attractive to Booker. As it turns out, that isn't important.

We come at last to the one who's supposed to be the important character, Grace, the teen-age amputee. Evans was careful not to burden the horse with manic-depressive tendencies resulting from Grace MacLean's crippling. We're left to think that being smacked by a semi was cause enough. In the event, even her handicap loses its importance. Grace has a more crippling situation to deal with, a mother whose behaviour would make a spider blush. Evans, of course, fit the story into 20th Century social norms by having Grace ultimately accept her father's cuckolding. The film reprises this seditious scenario, leaving Sam Neill the modern hapless male. [One wonders when he's going to break the weak reed parts he's been saddled with.] Annie MacLean wants the western hunk, she snares him and that's justification enough. It also turns out to be the single point of both book and film. Not much substance, but Redford didn't have much to work with.",1001289600,9,3056,5.061507936507937

981607,4,6305128952,"The Horse Whisperer
Score: 83/100
Adapted from Nick Evan's stunning novel, The Horse Whisperer is an endearing and surprising look into country life and healing horses. It opens with a truly haunting scene, and just continues to get better and better. By the end of the movie, you'll be trying with a lot of effort to catch your breath...this is one heck of a film, really it is, so don't miss out.
It is a cold winter day. Grace (Scarlett Johansson) and her best friend Judith (Kate Bosworth) go for a ride with their horses, but a terrible accident changes her life forever. A truck hits them; Judith and her horse are killed, while Grace and her horse Pilgrim are seriously injured, both physically and mentally. In an attempt to bring Pilgrim back from his now savage condition, Grace's mother Annie (Kristin Scott Thomas) takes them to Montana in search for Tom Booker (Robert Redford). Tom is a ""horse Whisperer"", a cowboy with the ability to ""communicate"" with horses. In the land of the Wild West Annie will change the way she sees life forever, as the wise cowboy slowly heals the souls of Pilgrim and Grace...
It's not perfect, and the running time is, as with all Robert Redford's films, over-long, but the 2-and-a-half-hour's buzz by, it seems like your only sitting in your seat for a half an hour. Still, 2.5 hours is just pushing the limit. But, as I said, that doesn't effect us, Robert Redford's direction is hard not to praise, he brings Nick Evan's great novel stunningly to life, the film has a largely plausible cinematographer, and the whole movie looks like a crystal clear dream. Also commendable are the amazing performances, the British Kristin Scott Thomas is on fire as Annie, she has a fiery chemistry with Robert Redford (also directing). However, the main acting star is surprisingly teen actor Scarlett Johansson, who brings the emotionally scarred Grace truthfully to life, her performance is truly moving, she plays a character, not an actor, and that is an extremely hard thing for an actress her age to do.
The Horse Whisperer not only demands repeated viewings, it commands to be praised, and it is. Very highly.",985478400,4,2149,4.795148247978437

981609,5,6305128952,"An extremely moving blend of visual imagery and a compelling story of strength, love and realizations, ""The Horse Whisperer"" brings to life one of the bext novels ever written, while also giving the audience a movie that sets a new standard for emotion and feeling. It's a film that makes us laugh and a cry, a movie that depresses us as well as gives us an uplifting sense of wonder and awe. This has got to be one of the best movies ever made.
When her daughter Grace is critically injured while riding her horse, her business-oriented parents go through the painful decision of having her legs removed, which comes as a shock to Grace when she awakens from her coma. What's more, the horse is left with severe physical and emotional scars, none of which anyone can or knows how to heal. Even as the horse becomes increasingly distant and violent when approached by a human, Grace's mother, Annie, refuses to allow the animal to be put down, and begins researching methods and techniques of horse recuperation. When she comes across a magazine article about ""horse whisperers,"" she makes a call to the man interviewed in the article, Tom Booker, who is unable to help her.
While shown in theaters, up until this moment of the movie, the film is shown in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio, which is to reflect the cramped, noisy lifestyle that Annie lives in. Determined to find a cure for her daughter's horse as well as to mend their dwindling relationship, she packs the horse and her crippled daughter into their car and takes them on a road trip to Montana, where the film then takes on the aspect ratio of 2.35:1, allowing us to enjoy the full splendor of the surrounding hills and mountains. When they reach their destination, Tom agrees to help her so long as Grace is willing to offer her help. Willing the horse back to its normal attitude proves to be no easy task, though Tom has extreme patience in dealing with the animal. As the progress begins to grow, so does the bond between Annie and Tom, as well as the relationship between mother and daughter. But will Annie's and Tom's differences keep them apart? And what about her husband, who is waiting for results back in the city?
The movie takes its time in exploring its plot, giving us nothing but meticulous detail in every nuance of the story. There is never a moment throughout the movie when we do not know what kind of feelings each character is going through, nor are we left in the dark when something intrical to the advancement of the plot occurs. While it may look as simple as the country life it portrays, the story is utterly complex and moving, finely tuned with emotion and themes of love, sadness, and natural beauty.
The extensive visual imagery and settings are so gorgeous and so large that some of the shots almost swallow the characters. The beauty of the mountain ranges and low-lying valleys of Montana and the Midwest are so satisfying that they alone are worth going to see the movie if for nothing else. They also act as a symbolization of the characters' feelings, because throughout the movie, most of the characters at some time feel lost and confused, which is underlined by the vast amounts of open space that surrounds them all. I don't think there has ever been a film so far that has been able to give us such a wondrous canvas of natural beauty like this one has done.
Character development is done with such terrific clarity that I was able to identify emotionally with different characters on different levels. Tom Booker is played superbly by Robert Redford, and is the embodiment of the simplistic, easy-going rancher who is not satisfied with material possessions, but more with the joy he gets from his family and his work. Annie is played by Kristin Scott Thomas, who delivers a powerful and complex performance in making us believe in her struggles with her daughter and the horse. The love story angle that Annie and Tom share is a moving and brilliant emotional display, and what is even better about it is that it does not become so overly-engrossing that is consumes the main focus of the story, which is the horse's recovery.
As ""The Horse Whisperer"" unfolds, you'll find yourself moved by every waking minute of its complex plot and involving characters. The core of this movie is nothing but heart, and lots of it, which is enough for a tear-jerker as well as a truly uplifting experience.",982627200,9,4395,4.650385604113111

981737,4,6305128952,"Well, not quite.  When one thinks about it, it's about hope, redemption  and the saving of souls.  It's about a family who's been torn apart through  a grizzly accident, leaving one teenage girl dead, and another teenage girl  and her prized horse mangled (both physically and mentally).  It's about a  family's thinly veiled serenity being suddenly unmasked, and in the wake  exposes a great vulnerability that lets loose the undercurrent of  depression, frustration and hostility.
Annie (Kristin Thomas), a  head-strong, high-pressure magazine editor and world traveler is suddenly  (and maybe for the first time) faced with something she is totally  unprepared to handle--losing her daughter.  Seeing the ever widening gulf,  she becomes desperate enough to leave New York and seek help from an  unusual animal healer, Tom Booker (Robert Redford), a so-called horse  whisperer.  Throwing caution to the wind, and against her husband's wishes  (nicely played by Sam Neil), Annie forces Grace (her daughter) to accompany  her and Pilgrim (Grace's horse) to a small ranch in the vastly open and  rugged state of Montana.
This is where the pace of the movie suddenly  changes from the beehive of ""civilization"" to one of sedate morning dew,  deep blue skies, rugged mountain sunsets, and the home-spun reality of a  rancher's way of life.  Booker, who quickly realizes that he has much more  than just a horse to heal, reluctantly takes on the chore.  What follows is  a deliberately paced process of healing.
Although this laid-back movie  may not be to everyones' taste (or patience), it worked its magic on me.  Between 1 and 10, I give ""The Horse Whisperer"" an 8.

Montana is  MAGNIFICENT in every way and so the setup is successful from the start.

When my younger sister first told me how she cried and  cried throughout this film and that she related to the horse....I had to  wonder! After viewing an horrific accident in the icy snow between a truck  and two young girls on their beloved horses, I saw an insight into my  sister's life I had not known. As ""Pilgrim"" ( Graces horse ) did,  my sister also felt scarred, disliked , and rebellious. See, she too had an  auto accident which left physical scars on her face and apparently in her  own psyche. This film was her catharsis.
This a beautifully shot  meandering journey to find oneself again. Whether you are the young girl,  the confused yet strong mother, the displaced father, the hallowed horse or  even the magically patient horse whisperer himself.
The crazier this  techno world gets...the more I say, ""Life is calling, but why can't  she whisper?"" Enjoy!

Friends and I went to watch the movie  expecting a little romance but more focusing on the horse end of things.  It started out like the book but wasn't finished the way the book was.

981884,5,6305128952,"""The Horse Whisperer"" is unlike any other movie that I've seen. The story opens as a young girl, Grace, experiences a terrible accident while riding her horse, Pilgrim, on an icy road. Driven mad by shock and  pain, Pilgrim is almost to the point of death. Grace is also in critical  condition, for she has badly injured her right leg in the accident, and it  must be amputated. Grace's mother Annie (Kristin Scott Thomas) reads about  a man named Tom Booker (Robert Redford) who is known as a ""horse  whisperer,"" able to communicate and see into the troubled souls of  these animals. A few days later, Annie, along with her hesitant daughter  and Pilgrim in tow, sets out for Montana. There, at Mr. Booker's ranch, do  you witness the amazing changes that occur as Tom begins to heal Pilgrim's  spirit (along with Grace's). Soon after, Annie and Tom fall in love. The  rest of the story unfolds in a symphonic display of love, hope, and  miraculous recoveries. The film's ending is not your typical movie closing,  but it is very good nonetheless. The beautiful Montana landscape adds to  this special aura, and the characters are brilliant (both human and  equine). I highly recommend this excellent movie to absolutely anyone.  You'll fall in love with ""The Horse Whisperer.""",961891200,28,1278,4.824884792626728
981885,4,6305128952,"The Horse Whisperer is sucha  beautiful film it takes your breath away. The film's stunning cinematography, it's awesome acting and great storyline make it a 4 star movie and one of the best of 1998.
Scarlett Johnasson is  the star of the show, she plays 14 year old Grace, a horse-lover who has  just had a terrible accident with her friend. Her mother (Kristin Scott  Thomas) helps her daughter and her horse, Pilgrim by taking her to a 'horse  whisperer '(Robert Redford) who can heal horses.
This is a very sad,  beautiful and lovely movie and don't be put off by it's mammoth length (2  hours, 48 minutes) - to me it felt like 1 hour rather than 3.",959990400,28,653,4.436974789915967
981886,4,6305128952,"The Horse Whisperer is not a typical Hollywood movie. But then, none of the films Redford has directed, are in any way typical. The first time I really took notice of his work, was after seeing ""A River Runs Through  It"". He had managed to tell a brutal, sad story in a mystical way that  held me spell-bound.

Whisperer takes that feeling one step  further. It will hold you and then squeeze your heart till the tears come.  This is not a sad film however. It is the story of a spiritual journey that  a family makes with the aid of a talented guide, Tom Booker, (played by  Redford himself). Each of them takes their own paths but make it through  some trying times, emerging stronger than when they began.

The  story gets going as a result of a terrible accident involving two young  girls who are out riding in icy, lightly forested terrain. The lone  survivor, Grace, is traumatised by the loss of her friend, her foot and, in  another way, her horse Pilgrim. Not that Pilgrim was killed, despite the  wishes of the local veterinarian, but it was not the same, sane horse that  it had been.

The normal tensions that existed within the family  are magnified by the aftermath of the accident. Grace becomes withdrawn,  suffering guilt and shame which show themselves in her bitterness toward  her parents, Annie and Robert. At the same time she makes a connection  between herself and Pilgrim. The horse's fate seems to be a grim portent of  her own future; scarred, maddened and kept in a dark and lonely place.

Annie's desperate search for a treatment for Pilgrim is therefore  very understandable. She hopes to build a bridge back to the world for her  daughter, by healing Pilgrim. Here enters the almost magical legend of the  Horse Whisperers. A breed of men, so in tune with horses, that they are  said to be able to talk with them... to look into the soul of the beast and  calm its raging spirit.

Tom Booker seems to have a healthy  scepticism for the legend however and makes his down to earth philosophy  pretty clear from the first moment when we hear him say, "" Well truth  is, I help horses with people problems.""

Despite Tom and  Robert's reluctance, Annie drags Grace from her pit of despair, to cross  the country on the slim hope of making everything right again, on a Montana  ranch, with a little help from a horse whisperer. Her expectation are  rudely shattered within hours of arriving. Tom doesn't act like a paid  specialist. From the outset it is clear to him that young Grace needs as  much healing as Pilgrim. And this is a load he seems more than capable of  bearing.

By now we are well and truly hooked by the story. But the  best is yet to come. Redford clearly loves the great outdoors and his  feeling shouts from the big screen. Montana must be God's own country  because it is breathtaking. Now add a dash of wholesome family values, good  old hard work, reluctant romance and a pinch of equine shamanism and you've  got something special.

The Horse Whisperer is a movie that makes  you feel like dozing in the long grass, on a lazy Summer afternoon. Don't  be afraid of grass stains; go see this unusual film and have a roll in the  grass for me.",957657600,111,3192,4.506129597197899
981887,5,6305128952,"Unfortunately I missed this movie on the big screen, but I saw it a month ago on cable.  I was amazed by it from start to finish, Mr. Robert Redford, the cast and crew, just did a superb job.  The love story between Annie and Mr. Tom Booker is risky, painful, gentle and classy. Grace's (Scarlett and  every actor deserves a big plus no matter how small the part is) and  Pilgrim's suffering is heartbreaking.  Robert, the father and husband,  silently keeps his feelings, then confronts them, but he never stops  loving. And thanks to Nicholas Evans and Robert Redford, through the Booker  Family, I loved that ranch, the grandeur of Montana, nature, the horses and  the fact that animals heal in their own way, it is also an example for  everyone - the love the characters have for their home and how proud they  were of it. I could go on, but I don't want to give anything away. Just  watch it, you will never regret it, because it is an unforgettable  movie!  I live in the city, but I would definitely not mind at least  ""One ride."" Thank you Mr. Redford it is always delightful to  watch you (Great actor and handsome), Mrs. Kristin Scott Thomas was just  the right actress, outstanding nobody could have done it better and also  congratulations to all who made the movie.

I really loved the daughter in this movie,  which reminded me somewhat of the daughter in Stepmom.  The actress who  plays her, though, does a STUNNING job giving her a bitterness that most  adolescent actresses miss when playing these sort of parts.  In fact, her  character's relationships with her mother and Redford was so compelling  that it quickly overshadows the romance between Redford and Thomas, which  honestly has little chemistry.
However, as much as I loved her character,  I HATED Redford's acting as the Horse Whisperer.  He plays the Mystical  Healer with as much cliche and vanity as she plays the daughter with anger  and pain.  Kristin Scott Thomas's acting style is understated and subtle;  yet, to Redford's wooden smiles, she's by contrast a spasm of passion.
I still highly recommend the film.  If you swoon to Redford, this will  probably work for you.  Otherwise, you may find Redford's  self-aggrandizement to be a crutch to this film.",926294400,,1211,4.955

At the same time, having had to deal with a  child's needs as opposed to holding onto a well-paying job, I can relate to  her actions.

This movie is about healing...not only healing the horse, but healing individual lives and relationships.  It was  evident to me that Pilgrim and Grace suffered from post traumatic stress  symptoms.  Perhaps that's because I view it from the role of a mental  health counselor.  I commend Robert Redford for bringing to the film his  sensitivity in teaching us about healing.  I'm not sure who changed the  ending, but since Redford directed it, I assume he did.  Had the movie  ended as the book did, everyone would have been re-traumatized. Life brings  pain to all of us.  Life is a process, a journey.  We learn as we go.  If  we study The Horse Whisperer, we can learn that patience, persistence, and  a learned guide can help us heal.

The movie was too slow for my taste, but that was only part of the problem.  There really wasn't much in the way of ""horse whispering"", and I  felt not enough time was focused on the object of the movie's premise...  the injured girl AND horse. The relationship between Redford's character,  and Ann also brought up some ethical questions. While yes, she did choose  her husband over Redford, the fact remains that she did some things that I  find questionable. She returns and that's that. Perhaps my beliefs got in  the way of a movie that so many find appealing, but even aside from that, I  thought it was terribly slow, and not something I wish to view again.

I have a friend  who used the ""gentler"" technique to gain the confidence of an  adopted Mustang filly.  It works!
