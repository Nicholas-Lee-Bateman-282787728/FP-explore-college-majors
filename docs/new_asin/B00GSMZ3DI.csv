6107817,2,B00GSMZ3DI,I would not recommend this to anyone I Love Movies but this was terrible Bad acting no plot just a hot mess,1398038400,,107,3.909090909090909
6107818,1,B00GSMZ3DI,Not in a good way.  No talented actors and script seemed non existent. Don't waste your time on this video.,1394928000,,107,4.35
6107819,4,B00GSMZ3DI,"I'm giving this an extra star because of Vanessa Bell Calloway's amazing yet campy performance. Holla 2 is the sequel to Holla where  Monica and her friends go to a cabin for the weekend only to be killed by Monica's twin sister Veronica yet Monica barley escapes with her life.

I love an Urban slasher film even though they are few and far between.check out 7eventy 5ive and Somebody Help Me,both really good Urban slashers.

In this sequel Monica has gotten plastic surgery and is living with her Murdered fiance's mother ""Vanessa Bell Calloway"".Monica has gotten engaged again so she and the wedding party head to the Douglas Plantation ""of all places"" to get married where it is rumored there are the ghosts of 13 dead slaves that haunt the plantation.

The music had great urban flavor and the dialogue was at times hilarious such as when people were getting killed Monica didn't want to go out of the plantation house away from the killer or killers because her weave would get wet! The kills were much better than the original but not great although they were still effective and didn't play the (kill off camera game).

They even have the equivalent to crazy Ralph from Friday the 13th in the form of Ralphie an old man who warns them of impending doom as they exit the logical country store. I enjoyed it and found several aspects that kept me entertained. There is a combo platter of great characters which include the drunk Jamaican mother in law, the Hoe,the gay guy,the horny dude that will hit anything  just to name a few! They even payed homage to ""Night Of The Living Dead"" for being arguably the first film to have a Black actor as the hero especially in a Horror film by having a television playing his part on the screen which the camera panned to a few times.",1394323200,2,1781,4.567398119122257

8626821,4,B00GSMZ3DI,This movie is more comedy than horror. I laughed through 75% of it.,1425945600,,67,4.230769230769231
8626822,3,B00GSMZ3DI,Clearly the more successful of the two Holla cinematic works.,1425081600,,61,5.2
8626823,3,B00GSMZ3DI,I thought Holla 2 was okay. I think I like the first one better. It's nice that the movie has a predominately black cast. But what it lacks is the usual blood and guts that come with slasher movies. I think the movie tries to be too hip and not scary enough.,1422835200,,258,3.980769230769231
8626824,1,B00GSMZ3DI,"Good heavens, this movie is SO TERRIBLE, it's mind boggling. It's absolutely, positively nothing short of asinine. Really!!!",1415664000,2,124,5.944444444444445
8626825,5,B00GSMZ3DI,Campy but keeps your attention it was so bad it was actually good (Sharknado Anyone),1412812800,,84,4.666666666666667
8626826,1,B00GSMZ3DI,"Seriously, I don't know why this movie has such a good rating on IMD it was absolute garbage. The story was unoriginal, the writing was bad, even the acting lacked life (and death). I will say the plot had some moments of near redemption, but not enough to keep me interested.
From a horror stand point I, not once, jumped or felt frightened. I honestly felt like this whole movie was just made up of all the deleted scenes from I Know What You Did Last Summer 2 and Halloween. There was really nothing original about the plot and most of the characters, including most of the leads, who were bland at best, very hard to relate to. Also the editing was shotty and the camera angles looked like they were shot by the blind guy at the convenient store. You know the one that had no plot purpose but still left you with more than the rest of the other characters.
This movie also does very little to make me feel for the characters so when they die it leaves very little impacted. To be perfectly honest, and I'm really not kidding here when I say that I've watch low budget films that had better camera work, better special effects, far better writing and character development. The whole movie was filled with clichs whether it be characters stereotypes, plot points, tropes, poor score music and even listless dialogue.
I mean the whole movie was a bust, the sad part is I think with the right writers, director and even producers this actually could have been good, but it's execution was extremely poor. I DO NOT recommend this film to anyone and I think most of the people who give it praise are doing so because they like the lead actress. For those who are still interested, please just wait till it's released on Netflix, DO NOT pay for it, I promise you will be very disappointed.",1403049600,,1787,4.467889908256881
8626827,5,B00GSMZ3DI,Holla is one of my favorite movies Holla 2 was good I cant believe her sister still was coming after monica again.,1401148800,,114,4.2272727272727275
8626828,1,B00GSMZ3DI,The preview was so misleading. It looked like an action filled movie with some humor.  We couldn't even finish it,1400371200,,113,4.65
8626829,1,B00GSMZ3DI,You should burn the original!  This is the worst horror movie ever.  The only two site people are stupider than dirt and get killed off right at the beginning.  REALLY What were you thinking!,1399852800,,191,4.5588235294117645
