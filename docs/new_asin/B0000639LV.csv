1689675,4,B0000639LV,"I do not agree with some of the comments made by some of the reviewers of this tape. The controversy over the win by the Russian pair was warrented. Anton stepped out of his double axel,Elena leaned forward on the throw triple,the Russian death spiral was nowhere near the Canadians and the Russian lifts only covered half the ice surface while the Canadians covered the full length of the ice. The Canadians connected with the audience better as well as connecting to themselves. The program drew you in and ranged from new found love to the total depths of despair in losing a loved one, as in the movie Love Story. I think Sale and Peltier gave one of the all time great figure skating performances. They deserved 6's. But don't take my word for it. The commentators of this event,who are themselves figure skaters, said the Canadian performance was perfect and were shocked, as I was when the marks came up. Sale and Peltier finally received a gold medal, but there marks will remain the same for history. What a shame!!!!",1102377600,,1026,4.642857142857143
1689676,5,B0000639LV,"I watch this video once a week!  I love so many of the programs: Jealousie (Sale and Pelletier-Short Program), Love Story (Sale and Pelletier-Long Program), Timothy Goebel-Long Program, The Man in the Iron Mask (Alexei Yagudin-Long Program), and Sarah Hughes-Long Program.  The movies also gives good information on the pairs' controversey and the rivelry between Alexei Yagudin (men's gold medalist) and Yevgeny Plushenko (men's silver medalist).",1046476800,,447,5.757575757575758
1689677,4,B0000639LV,".. with the many hours of footage, and the availability of the DVD platform, NBC could have done a lot better.
As with all figure skating events, the commentary gets a bit annoying.  You can tell that the commentators (Scott Hamilton et al) REALLY wanted Michelle Kwan to win the gold, and their bias is a bit annoying, if heartfelt.  All of the short programs for all events were shown in bits and pieces, rather than in full form.  In previous CBS-produced videos (92, 94, and 98) the short programs for most of the medalists were shown in their entirety, at least the American skaters.
Buy the combination competition/exhibition package for a better deal, both in terms of price and content.
Note to NBC - WHERE IS THE DVD?",1019520000,10,726,4.612403100775194

7959107,5,B0000639LV,"DVD has a very high quality picture! Love Sarah Hughes' performance - two triple-triple combinations!!! Her long program would still be competitive in 2017, and that layback spin.  I also love Sasha Cohen's ""Carmen"" program - just beautiful!

And it's nice that if you press the skip button on your DVD remote control, you can navigate to each of the four chapters - pairs, men's, dance, and ladies' competition. So you can watch all or as many of the chapters as you wish.  That's a nice feature that you do not get with the VHS version of this program.

I would definitely highly recommend this DVD to any skating fan or just someone who wants to experience the beauty of this sport in crystal clear picture.",1502496000,2,710,4.611111111111111

7959112,1,B0000639LV,"I was very disappointed with this dvd. It was sloppily compiled with no information as to where each skater ranked or what skate they were performing before showing each piece. They told who the winners were upfront, there was absolutely no suspence and they left out many of the top performances. They should take a lesson from Bud Greenspan's videos where some background information is given and there is a build up to the final outcome. I think someone wanted to make some money and just half heartily slapped some performances together. Too bad...they didn't do justice to the many surprising and outstanding skating performances of this Olympics.",1201305600,6,652,5.046296296296297
7959113,5,B0000639LV,"I loved this video! the mens and pairs freeskates are a must see.

though it is edited to center mostly on the Russians and the Americans,this video does have clips of other skaters. I highly recommend this!",1147219200,,207,4.594594594594595
7959114,3,B0000639LV,"I bought this DVD because I wanted to see Sarah Hughes' out-of-this-world long program. It was great. Overall, watching this DVD was not as good as watching the skating live on TV. The comentary wasn't bad, but it was a little too dramatic considering most viewers already know the outcomes. There wasn't quite enough skating. I want to see Sarah's short program too. And Sasha Cohen's. Also some of the footage from behind the scenes was cut out that I really enjoyed when I was watching it on TV. I would have liked to see it again.

This DVD is not bad, but not fabulous. If you have no record of the skating, and want to see the medal winners' long programs, this will suffice. I am glad I got it because at least I have something to remember the Salt Lake figure skating by.",1121212800,9,779,4.372413793103449
7959115,3,B0000639LV,"This DVD contains 90 minutes of figure skating competition highlights, taken directly from NBC's broadcasts during the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.  NBC Sports commentator Beth Ruyak provides very good narration.

True to big-media form, this production gives virtually all its time to ""quest for the gold"" stories, which means that, in both video and commentary, the viewer experiences very little other than the circumstances involved with achieving medals.  The only complete skating routines shown are of contestants vying for a gold medal, and in the case of the singles skating performances, you only get to see the long programs.  With the exception of the women's singles skating competition, no more than two or three individuals/pairs are featured.  I would have enjoyed seeing more complete routines, especially those of the short program for singles; also, the continued sorrow over Michelle Kwan not winning a gold medal was tiring.  She's awesome . . . period.

The good news is that a major television network can employ top-notch cameramen to go along with the latest technology, so the result is a brilliant picture virtually all the way through.  The sound is very good as well.  If one could call missing things a plus, I'm thankful that there was very little commentator speculation about the skating order, emotional state of the competitors, judges' scoring, etc.  Another positive is that the breaks between skating routines are short and informative.  I was also pleased that the time in the ""kiss and cry"" area (where skaters can wave to the camera and/or pass sign language messages to their friends back home) was kept to a minimum.

Unfortunately, there are no DVD ""extras"" at all.  The opening screen has but one option:  ""PLAY,"" and with only four chapters encompassing the events, quick forwarding to your favorite routines isn't possible.

Overall, this is a decent DVD, suitable for your sports/skating library.",1104624000,19,1955,5.161904761904762
