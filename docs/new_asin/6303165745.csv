7839861,4,6303165745,"This is easily one of my favorite Anime of all time.  While it tends to get forgotten amongst all the current ""hot"" titles, it's really quite good.
The Story is intruiging, the animation is strong, if dated, and the characters are some of the most interesting you will see. If you are willing to look past the latest ""hot"" item, this is well worth your time.",1002240000,5,358,4.424242424242424
