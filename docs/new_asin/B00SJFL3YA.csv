8698616,5,B00SJFL3YA,"The cover page is very misleading since this is not about some friendly monkey specie, a  juvenile monkey as you see on the cover page, it is about the WARLORDS of India. Watching these warlards jumping in the air and flipping gracefully with no effort like a professional ballerina, you will be amazed at the brutality that it takes to be a warlard where the warlard is the one only male to a whole sisterhood and will do anything to defend his territory. With a tail longer than the length of their body and killer teeth, you will see what you do not see in any other monkey documentary. A BBC EARTH production with great cinematography and amazing chronicle of animal life and death in India's most colorful city like a jungle called Jodhpur. Witness the lucky, strong and ruthless monkeys who survive to become future warlords with intense, brutal, fascinating and an unimaginable world few ever see.",1440374400,8,904,4.7215189873417724
