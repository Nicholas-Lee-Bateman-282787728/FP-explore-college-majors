2334415,5,B0009X76Z0,"I enjoy this DVD very much! This series is a must for every uboot enthusiast, it details from the beging of the war to the end where the type XXI was almost used(well a couple were actualy used right at the very end of the war). I have watched this DVD several times since receiving it. What I like the most is how it pays a tribute towards the end to Grossadmiral Karl Doenitz. The footage is great, showing details of the uboots from this period and the celebration of the uboots after they would get back from a patrol.",1207440000,6,522,4.23

8069497,5,B0009X76Z0,A good dvd however the music is a bit too loud in the background  to hear the narration  sometimes.still a nice piece of history. Erich Topp i have always respected. He was  an U-Boot captain and i was sad to hear of his death just a few years back.  Corey,1397779200,,256,4.06
8069498,4,B0009X76Z0,"Excellent footage and narration on the last 2 years of the U-Boat arm.

If you have seen Das Boot, you will recognize the authentic German WW2 film footage on which that film was based, right down to the submariners drinking Becks beer.

The last 10 or 15 minutes is mostly on the politics of the end of the war, and, while useful and interesting, is covered elsewhere.

I would have preferred more on the Type XXI and XXIII boats, and plans for future boats.

The few seconds given to those final production models were glimpses of the future; the post WW2 modern submarine fleets.",1369008000,,582,4.5673076923076925

8069501,5,B0009X76Z0,"This video is a compilation of actual wartime film footage that includes ""the original cast"", not a modern day rendition of what may have been prepared with actors. As a result, the video is more of a documentary than a movie and is valuable to historians and others with similar interest for that very reason. Granted that some of the footage may have been the result of PR productions during WWII; they are still footage of the real thing taken during the war. If you want to go back in time for a glimpse of uboats as they actually existed during WWII, then this is the video for you. The narration is in English so you don't have to learn German to enjoy the experience.",1297382400,,674,4.4
8069502,4,B0009X76Z0,"This DVD, along with its sister volumes covering the 1942-1943 and 1939-44 periods, provide excellent video footage on the U-Boat war. Most of this footage consists of German newsreels so it provides a perspective intended to diplomatically intimidate outside of Germany and to garner support for the war effort and the Nazi Party within Germany. As a result one sees plenty of video footage that is quite unrealistic but very impressive (i.e., a flotilla of u-boats working a few hundred yards from each other in open seas, etc.). Needless to say, a good deal of this is not very realistic. However, much of the footage provides good footage of vessels being sunk, life on board the vessels, refueling from submarine tankers and even the application of a manned helicopter being launched from the deck of a u-boat). In addition, there is footage of surface craft also. Much of this would be of interest to not only the novice, but the knowledgeable viewer also.

The video not only has good film footage but is fairly informative (at least for the novice), even though the voice over is in a very dull British accent. Not only is the history of the boats recounted but there is good analysis regarding their strenghts, weaknesses per se as well as factors affecting the u-boat arm in general (i.e., deterioration in crew training and quality, slow development of boats superior to type VII and IXs [i.e., type XXIs], etc.). All and all quite informative. Far more so than documentaries one would normally see on the topic on History, Discovery or Military Channels in the U.S.",1265673600,6,1577,4.862453531598513
8069503,5,B0009X76Z0,This is a great addition to any Uboat fanatics library....made from actual footage taken at land and sea.....provides good insight as to what was occuring during the Battle of the Atlantic.....,1235001600,3,193,5.258064516129032
