2786548,5,B000NVRONM,"I have been working through first DVD of this series, and am now beginning to work through the second. I find it stimulating to look ahead to see where this whole process is going.

Like the first DVD in this series, this one is extremely well put together. There are lengthy practice sessions to watch and practice with. The master teacher demonstrates slowly and with great care, and explains thoroughly. It is fascinating to watch the students respond to him, and to see how they move. The rhythmic nature of the movement and the music provide a hypnotic effect which makes the strenuous effort involved seem  less so. The patterns of movement done with the ball are complex, intricate, and beautiful.

This style of tai chi is extremely demanding and yet soothing, and helps increase bone density, balance, coordination , concentration, and physical strength, among other things . There are so many benefits to earn and to look forward to, as one progresses through these comprehensive courses.",1310860800,,998,4.9640718562874255
2786549,5,B000NVRONM,"Taiji Ball Qigong parts 3&4 (listed as disc 2 in the search), will definitely lead to strengthening a conditioning your forms along with body and mind. This program is wonderful for any serious tai chi student interested in the next level of practice. The movements are easy to follow and are repeated often. They are also filmed from various directions and show five different people with
varied body shapes. I would have liked to see the forms demonstrated by beginners, elder players and people in less than prime physical condition. I would be interested in the directions and corrections that Master Yang would have to that group of people. Some of his corrections like, ""pay attention to your root"" will be understood by practiced students, but may not be so readily understood by people not familiar with tai chi forms and principles. Skill level on this DVD is listed and second level, (one-three levels available).

As with any real taiji, it is best to learn directly from a Master teacher and use the film material as a review and practice tool.

This course teaches patterns of stationary and moving Taiji.

Backward Circling, Rotating, and Wrap-Coiling-Yin

HORIZONTAL CIRCLING

Clockwise Circling, Rotating, and Wrap-Coiling-Yang
Counterclockwise Circling, Rotating, and Wrap-Coiling-Yin

There are solo and partner drills to develop coiling and neutralizing skills. I like that the patterns are repeated enough times that
you can follow along and develop a sense of flow. I used a child's beach ball in my living room to try out the techniques without breaking furniture in the small space available for practice. I then used some old bowling balls outside to get a sense of the weight and power needed to do these forms at a higher level. Finding a real taiji ball is on my list of things to do very shortly.

My qigong classes have a few students of very different levels in them. One student has very severe problems with left/right coordination stemming from a brain injury. I had her do some of the beginning drills using a large, light beach ball. It really
helped to activate her weaker side.  Another two students study with my teacher, some spinning hands and sticking techniques. We found the section of using the ball against the cinder block to be extremely helpful. It is a great way to begin to feel the center to center and point of contact for push hands.

I would highly recommend both DVD's in this series to anybody interested in strengthening their body, conditioning muscles, improving taiji forms and finding real peace in the repetition of the qigong ball sets.",1301184000,,2667,4.988738738738738
2786550,5,B000NVRONM,"Disclaimer
I was sent this DVD for no cost to review it.  Regardless, I have been purchasing and enjoying Master Yang's products since the early eighties.  I would have purchased this DVD regardless.  I also spend many hours reviewing and writing the reviews.  If I wrote a one paragraph review, which requires very little thought and time, then my motives might be suspect.  Bottom line.  Master Yang is the real deal and his products speak for themselves.  I've never heard any complaints about anything he has produced.

This DVD is a compilation of parts 3 & 4 of the video tape series covering Taiji Ball Qigong.  Taiji Ball Qigong should be learned by everyone interested in Taijiquan.  The patterns taught in this video are an integral part of Taijiquan movement.  Persons already skilled in Taijiquan will recognize the basic types of movement covered in this video.  There are many patterns that one does in the Taijiquan form that many students might not realize exist.  While doing these Taiji Ball exercises I recognized patterns that I have observed when practicing the martial applications and forms of Taijiquan.

What is also wonderful about this DVD is that Ramel Rones and Kathy Yang, Master Yang's daughter, are two of the five students used to demonstrate the patterns.  Ramel Rones has created and published Sunset Tai Chi, Sunrise Tai Chi and Tai Chi Energy Patterns, and he is obviously a very dedicated and serious student/teacher.  I'm not aware of any DVDs by Kathy Yang, but she shows most ably that her father's skills have been passed on to her.

As I am a father as well, I must admit I got a tear in my eye when I thought of how proud Master Yang must be of his daughter.  She has obviously put a lot of time and effort into learning his skills and developing her own.  Her rooting is very prominent as she demonstrates the patterns on this DVD.

COURSE THREE TAIJI BALL CIRCLING
There are 16 Circling, Rotating & Wrap-Coiling Patterns taught in this course. There are a total of 48 patterns taught on the two DVDs of this series.  Courses 1 & 2 are on a previously released DVD.
Table of Contents:

VERTICAL CIRCLING

Forward Circling, Rotating, and Wrap-Coiling-Yang
Backward Circling, Rotating, and Wrap-Coiling-Yin

HORIZONTAL CIRCLING

Clockwise Circling, Rotating, and Wrap-Coiling-Yang
Counterclockwise Circling, Rotating, and Wrap-Coiling-Yin

At the beginning of each section Dr. Yang demonstrates the techniques that are being taught along with an explanation and description.
Five students are then used to demonstrate the drill while standing in stationary horse stance.

Later they demonstrate the moves while standing in a bow stance while rocking back and forth.

The students then demonstrate one at a time how to take forward and backward, single and multiple steps while maintaining the drill.

Then two students at a time face each other and walk the Bagua circle, each of them walking the circle in a different direction while facing each other and circling, wrapping and coiling the Taiji Ball.

At times Dr. Yang will join in with the group as they each express the movements in their own unique ways.  Dr. Yang also walks around and offers advice and corrections about the movements.  At times Dr. Yang gives somewhat vague advice, such as ""Watch your root"" or ""Watch your back leg."".  A viewer might feel that more instruction should be provided to explain what these suggestions mean.  As such, I would caution beginning students that if they try to follow this DVD, be prepared to ponder and learn the basics of Taijiquan movement, as that will help in understanding what is presented here.

Taijiquan Ball Qigong is of much more interest and has more immediate value for those with a background in Taijiquan.  Followers of Dr. Yang and serious students of Taijiquan already have a fairly clear idea of the meaning of ""Watch your root"" and ""Watch your back leg"", so there would not be a problem in understanding the directions of Dr. Yang.

  However, let me back pedal a bit.  If a student is willing to work hard and dig out the meaning of some of these terms, then even a beginner can benefit from this DVD.  Just don't let the lack of understanding slow you down or discourage you, but rather take it as a challenge to make the effort to learn and understand the information.

As you learn these movements and then engage in push hands with another practitioner, you will readily see the value these movements bring to applying the techniques in Taijiquan, as well as enhancing one's ability to adhere, stick follow and eventually lead.  In a previous DVD by Dr. Yang, he suggested taking a 100 lb kick bag and circling your arms around it, then using your forearms and palms to spin the bag clockwise and counterclockwise.

Additionally he taught how to use the forearms to bounce the bag back and forth.  Such an exercise also develops ones sense of touch and allows one to learn the skill of moving large objects effortlessly.  The exercises taught on this DVD are similar but more advanced and complex.

COURSE FOUR TAIJI BALL APPLICATIONS

When you begin to watch the DVD from the beginning, choosing to Play All, there is a brief shot of a painting showing two Taiji practitioners engaged in push hands while using a Taiji Ball.  When I first saw it I thought, ""Now show me some of that on the DVD"".  Well, part 4 comes through with a ton of applications and two man and solo practice.  It is excellent.

Whenever I attempt to review one of Master Yang's productions, I usually feel that I need to write a 20 page review in order to give it justice.  As usual, there is a tremendous amount of information on this DVD.  I can't even begin to review Course 4 due to space restraints.  However, it is the gem of the series.  Just don't make the mistake of only trying to learn the applications from Course 4, as tempting as that may be.  Spend the time and develop a strong foundation with the previous Courses 1, 2 & 3 prior to attempting the applications in Course 4.  Courses 1 & 2 were previously released on DVD.

I'll just repeat my comments from the review of the first DVD of courses 1 & 2. as they apply to this DVD as well  ""This video has an amazing amount of information.  I strongly recommend it to any student of Taijiquan.  The skills taught and the benefits received make the video appropriate for anyone interested in body/mind/spirit development.""  That pretty much sums it up, except I also need to praise the wonderful addition of Taiji Ball applications that are found on Course 4 of this DVD.",1203897600,14,7352,4.787878787878788

Course 3 includes coiling, vertical and horizontal movements with the ball. Course 4 has solo and partner applications. This video moves slowly allowing it to be easy to follow along with and the instructions are clear. This DVD is ranked Level 2 and is excellent for the intermediate student. As a beginner with the ball I found it easy to follow along.  This exercise helps with breathing, coordination and every aspect of maintaining a healthy body. I highly recommend this video.

8182057,4,B000NVRONM,"The DVDs are the usual, thorough, YMAA pedogogy -- Dr. Yang's series on Qinna, for instance, is still probably the best available.

There are 2 DVDs in the series.  Tai Chi Ball Qigong, numbered with a ""1"" (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594390517/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2) and this one (which has a 2 inside the green circle on the front).

These are completely basic.  If you have yet to develop a feeling for your qi flow, and you are trying to find a way to kick start that process, I'd say these are some great techniques.  I plan to use a lot of this in the taiji classes I teach.  As a way to develop and extend the feeling of qi, and to begin integrating proper breathing into the process, these DVDs -- along with the text -- are just great.

If you already have developed your qi sufficiently to start moving it around then, in a nut shell, tai chi ball is another interesting practice technique, in some ways no different from the way you'd extend your qi using a sword or staff.  I must say, however, that I will be using these core concepts as a strengthening exercise.

Bottom line: great techniques for developing one of the essential components of taiji, something impossible to explain but possible to feel: the mind (yi) must lead the qi.",1357430400,3,1262,4.7
