8011975,3,B0001FVE7M,"I paid less than three bucks, so I wasn't expecting a whole lot.  It's a live action filming of bears and other critters (skunks, foxes, etc.).  The story line is that ""Ruthie"" a baby bear ran off from her mom and got lost.  As an adult watching, you can tell that's not necessarily what is actually happening, just a bunch of clips put together with a narrator to tell the story.  Seems like something that's homemade.  However, I bought for my 1 year old and 4 year to watch in the car during our commute.  For that purpose and for the price I paid, I'm satisfied with my purchase.  I like the exposure of my kids seeing live action animals versus animated.  The bears do fight, so it can be scary for little ones, but my four year old had no problem (one year old fell asleep)... not bloody or gory, just growling, wrestling, and teething each other.  Film quality ok, but overall production and narration reminds me of something from the 70s.",1363305600,,946,4.421965317919075
