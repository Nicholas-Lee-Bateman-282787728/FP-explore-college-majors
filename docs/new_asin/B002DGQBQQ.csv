You can not say even for second that there is something old and childish in this movie. The French making crude joke  about semself without pity. I would say that the time has no effect on this movie. The quality of the movie is like ""the treasure of Sierra Madre"" of course another subject but w/o any patina of time. Immortal movie.",1484438400,,428,4.558441558441558
8365128,5,B002DGQBQQ,"I was introduced to this film while visiting France. The story is strong and engaging. The actors are highly invested and wonderful, especially Jean Gabin. The director manages to sustains a tension throughout the film. I'd love to see this film released in the US DVD format and with English subtitles.",1393113600,4,303,4.96078431372549
