8122787,2,B000FI9OG8,"I have Corelli singing/performng several songs at the 1971 Tokyo concert...Youtube; what I saw on this DVD must have been at a different 1971 concert?????.example Core 'ngrato...sings only a few lines; different pianist..waste of money! Thank goodness I have the Youtube see/hear..BUT Franco was the greatest tenor I have ever heard..and the best looking..I have many of his performances saved on Youtube and several CD's...he and Freni in Burrerfly! So, adio Franco and thank God we have some of his performances on CD/tape/DVD",1480464000,,528,5.373493975903615
8122788,5,B000FI9OG8,"Beautifully done by Franco Corelli. He is the greatest tenor of them all. I saw Corelli in Turandot, Romeo e Guiliette, La Forza etc..always colossal, and so he is here, and the Japanese are very enthusiastic. What an artist, come un'artista!

Whatever he sang buy it, all the cds and the dvd La Forza del Destino. The Turandot with Nilsson and Vishnevskaya is for the ages...Nilsson and Franco at the end of ""In questa reggia"" is comporable to the Great Wall of China in greatness.",1404345600,3,482,4.670588235294118
8122789,5,B000FI9OG8,"Am I the only viewer to see how utterly petrified Franco was at the beginning of the concert, I'm sure that even the the conducter was concerned after Questa o Quella ,.Why a man with such a glorious voice and such looks would be nervous escapes me. But what a remarkable change occurred as the concert progressed, he seemed to really be enjoying himself during the encores, so much so that even he was reluctant to leave the stage. An absolute must own dvd for lovers of great tenors.",1286409600,7,485,4.46067415730337
8122790,5,B000FI9OG8,"I was a Corelli fanatic since 1960 when I saw the Tosca movie.  Even as a teen I just knew it didn't get better than this.  I saw Franco live in several operas before this concert which I snapped up on tape as a pirate probably 30 some years ago.  Here we get the added intimacy with the audience and you get a feeling for what a gracious character this man was.  These are polite Japanese and they are screaming like Italians.  Just the piano intros to the encores set them off.

Did I mention he's gorgeous to look at too.",1247443200,9,524,4.138613861386139
8122791,5,B000FI9OG8,"What a powerful, gorgeous voice!  What fabulous good looks!!

This is a ""stand and sing"" concert to a very enthusiastic Japanese audience.  Every piece begins and ends with a well deserved, thunderous applause.

Corelli is wearing a tuxedo with tails, not the Western getup pictured on the DVD cover.  I think that was a very poor choice.  The picture quality of my DVD is poor but the sound is very good.  The song titles are provided in English but there are no subtitles.

What was I doing in 1971 that I missed Franco Corelli???  Had I heard him then, I'm sure I would have been an opera lover from then on!",1201219200,14,611,4.4324324324324325
8122792,5,B000FI9OG8,"This DVD or tape was taken off Japanese Television.  It has ""technical defects"" like mediocre to average sound quality and video ""noise"".  But, here in this DVD we have quite a few songs and arias sung live in a concert hall in front of an appreciative Japanese audience...35 years ago when Corelli was in his prime and not deceased!  How much is such a recorded concert worth to those people who appreciate the work of a great artist like Franco Corelli?  It's almost priceless!  Should you buy this DVD?  Yes...yes...and yes again...!  When Franco looks up into the TV Camera and seemingly smiles ""at you"" with that quizzical smile of his,  your heart will melt and you will be glad you purchased this!
