4006837,2,B002WERREY,"The view is breathtaking but the workout is very short. For exemple : the Warm up and the workout (walk and running) together are 15 min !!!!
come on ......
The mountain-biking is a little bit better .
I will disregards the group running , or watch it in my 70's....",1324080000,3,266,4.235294117647059
4006838,5,B002WERREY,"I purchased this video because I find working out on a treadmill is incredibly BORING. I am pleased to say that my workout was great and even playing it on a laptop at eye level was realistic enough and really kept my focus. It made the time fly by while looking at amazing scenery and you can go as fast or as slow as you want since the camera moves steadily at the same speed no matter what. So when you are with a pack of joggers and you are getting tired, you don't have that sense of defeat if you should begin to walk--You'll always be right behind them! You can walk, run, jog--sometimes you are alone or just with one person or a pack of joggers/runners/skiers in different scenic settings! It was really fun and kept my interest and i definitely will use it again and again to shed those unwanted pounds!!! i highly recommend this dvd!!",1315267200,2,845,4.320754716981132
4006839,4,B002WERREY,"This looks great on a flat panel TV and the HD quality is fantastic.  I just wish there was a way to turn off the ""inspirational"" voice.  However, I really enjoy my treadmill workouts much more!

UPDATE:  03/10/15
My husband really has been enjoying this DVD - though he does turn the sound off and listens to his own music....mainly because he doesn't like the inspirational voice.  :)",1311206400,3,386,4.617647058823529
4006840,5,B002WERREY,"I used it as a trained on elliptical, Ski-Skate machine, Precor AMT, and treadmill. It worked with anything and everything. It kept me going while inspiring, encouraging, challenging me by keeping me competitive with my fellow runners, and entertaining me at the same time.

The music was varied, but some of it was African drum beats and some voice along with it. Very effective and enjoyable!

Almost everything I have to say in my review is very positive. If I had to give a negative, it might be this, but it wasn't really negative, just not as positive as the rest of the workout and not really my style. On the screen were inspirational words, ""Peace"" ""Introspective"" ""Energy"" and who knows what else?! I never did figure that out. The narrative was full of inspirational platitudes, very new age, which doesn't appeal to me, but wasn't at all offensive. In fact, I laughed out loud a few times because it was a nice break from a tough workout. So much for the 'almost-but-not-quite' negative part. Back to what I really liked.

Speaking of which, the workout was tough. It goes on and on and on. We are with a group of runners running down paths through the forest. You can hear the other runners breathing hard, sometimes looking like they almost trip over a rock, a tree trunk in the forest, and just barely make it when they hop over a spot in the path where water is running. It gets so tough that you are concerned that a couple of the runners may drop out. You wish you could hand them a bottle of water to drink. In fact, you wish you had one for yourself too! Then we ran on rims and ridges and edges of mountain paths overlooking beautiful lakes and streams.  The water reminds me of the Aegean Sea, a gorgeous blue color that you just don't see every day but wish you could.

At one point the water was so beautiful and blue that all I wanted to do was jump in! I never use my Jacuzzi, but I knew that I was going to jump into it as soon as I was finished with my workout, and I did. It never felt better!

It was 105 degrees outside and I felt so blessed to have a way to enjoy the great outdoors without going out into the sweltering heat, except for that after-workout Jacuzzi, which fit right into the spirit of this DVD. In fact, the narrator mentioned getting a sports massage and hot bath afterward. I felt like he had read my mind.

It's very realistic.

I like it very much when he reminded us to breathe in and out. I sometimes forget to do that. It made for a very invigorating workout. I didn't want to be the first one to drop out. Really! It was that realistic.

I hung in as long as I could. The description says 130 minutes. My own workout was longer than that and there was still a runner running when I finally had finished, done my stretches, and quit for the day. I wonder if maybe they didn't count the intro in that 130 minutes. I watched that too.  EDITED to say that I went back to it the next day and realized that it just loops back to the beginning. It's a good thing that I stopped, because it was going to continue on forever.

I enjoyed every minute of it. This is a workout DVD that I will use more than many others that I have, and I have a huge collection of really excellent DVDs that keep me motivated.

If you look at a close-up of the cover, you can see an example of some of the scenery. Gorgeous!",1308441600,7,3352,4.25314465408805
4006841,5,B002WERREY,I'm really happy with this video.  I watch it when I'm jogging on my treadmill. It helps me to stay focused and the time seems to just fly by.  I would recommend this to my friends.,1307664000,3,181,4.0
4006842,5,B002WERREY,"This is a great workout video.  I have increased my workout sessions by 75% after purchasing this program.  It actually inspires me to walk for longer periods of time.  However, if you purchase this video, you must have a monitor of at least 22"".  I originally used a portable 10"" portable dvd player while working out, and the picture was too small.  I placed an old 19"" on a stand (old microwave cart) and it was ok, but I didn't get the true high def quality from the old 1985 glass screen.  Consequently, I purchased a reasonably priced Coby 22"" high def monitor with built in dvd player, and WOW, what a difference.  I would highly recommend this treadmill workout video.  I ended up with something similar to the picture in the add.  Of course, the bigger the screen, the better the viewing effect.",1305676800,18,804,4.527777777777778
4006843,4,B002WERREY,"First a pro is that the film quality is excellent.  There is no shaky video and the resolution on a HD TV is excellent.  The variety of scenery from beach to road race to forest trails is nice.  One con is, what's with the cooky pilates subtext on the screen such as ""oxygen"", ""tranquility"", etc?  Guess some people like that mental feel good mumbo-jumbo.  Wish there was an option to turn off.  Another slight con is that while you are running following one of the screen runners, they sometimes change the camera direction (opposite of the direction you are running).  Not a huge deal, but a little odd when you are really in to it on the treadmill.",1293926400,6,651,4.466101694915254
8383016,5,B002WERREY,This is great. I feel like I am running outside with other people,1417478400,,65,4.076923076923077
8383017,5,B002WERREY,"Most people will probably use this while running on their treadmill. I did that and it is motivating. I also used this video while exercising on the elliptical machine at the gym. That is similar to the treadmill and it is not surprising to see how well this works. I enjoy the scenery and the videography is very well done. Some of the scenes are so realistic; it almost feels like you are there. At times the motivational sayings are distracting and unnecessary, but overall they are OK and help motivate at least somewhat.

I should note that my treadmill is an aquatic treadmill in an Endless Pool. I transferred the video to a Sony Xperia Tablet Z and jog along. Some times I use wireless headphones but other times I just turn down the volume and jog along. When I get tired of that, I put on my mask and swimmer's snorkel, place the Xperia on the treadmill, and just start swimming along. To me, this is the way to exercise.",1406937600,,931,4.412790697674419
8383018,2,B002WERREY,"I ordered this dvd for my husband for Father's Day and my daughter also ordered the same dvd for her dad (both purchased thru Amazon). I opted to return the duplicate. We loved the DVD... very motivational and well made, but my problem is with the return policy. I have been an Amazon Prime member for quite a while and have never had a problem with my orders, but am not at all happy with the way my refund was handled. I didn't have a problem with the cost for mailing the dvd back to Amazon, but afterward I was charged a $15 restocking fee. My cost for mailing was around $5, so just to return the dvd it cost me about $20. The dvd was $29.95, so I basically paid Amazon $20 to send the darn thing back. Should have kept it and given it as a gift if I had known about the 50% restocking fee. Very disappointed Amazon!",1403654400,,821,4.105590062111801
8383019,5,B002WERREY,"It's so realistic, I almost went off the side of the treadmill when the runners/skiers/bikers ""in front of me"" were dodging trees!!",1372118400,,131,5.0
8383020,2,B002WERREY,"Strange, very strange.  I like the Virtual Active videos, as they give you a guideline of how hard to push yourself with resistance, RPE, and speed while you are taking the walk.  This video is not like that at all.  They seem to want to focus more on your mind...  They are constantly tossing up weird words and talking about imagining this and imagining that. This is supposed to be walking on a treadmill via scenery on my TV - not a meditation class!  If I wanted that, I would have gotten a good yoga DVD.  Everyone is different, as there is a lot of positive feedback on here for this DVD (which is what lured me into buying it), but I just couldn't get into it at all. I like good scenery and nice music while walking but don't need OR WANT any audiovisual meditation/altered consciousness mumbo jumbo while doing it - I don't believe in all that junk anyways.

Again, I like the Virtual Active videos, Tracey Staehle's Walking Strong and Walking Stronger DVDs, and Treadmoves DVDs for great treadmill workouts, but this one got sold on eBay - as I really disliked it and was bummed that I paid this much for it.",1371945600,8,1119,4.402912621359223
8383021,5,B002WERREY,"This introductory disk contains a mix of different scenery from across the country, morphing between sports and seasons.  I was was kept intrigued throughout my treadmill workout. The time just flew by. I forgot I was inside.",1369958400,,225,5.081081081081081
8383022,5,B002WERREY,"The only problem is they don't have any other videos like this!! We need more! What a beautiful escape after a day at the office. This isn't a work out its a way of life, I enjoy is very much and highly recommend. Thank you!",1357948800,8,224,4.0
8383023,5,B002WERREY,"When I first sat and had a look at this DVD, I was very sceptical. I get walkers/runners rage and don't like anyone infront of me. However once I got it playing I couldn't believe how motivational this DVD is. I own quite a few now and this is by far the best. Doubt I will ever use the others now. The scenery is fantastic. The photographer actually lets us see what he sees and doesn't cut out everything like a lot of other dvds do. It's so realistic that at one stage when running down to the beach, I actually held on to the treadmill!!  I love being with group runs and other people now and infact even though I haven't been running much lately, until I started this up again, I found I was running longer and faster using this DVD and not noticing it! Brilliant!  I read another review that you can't choose which place you run - this isn't true, you can choose to run the lakes, forests, marathons, group runs whatever you want.  I just hope the producers bring out more, although it would be a long time before I ever get bored with this one. Must buy! Love it!",1336262400,7,1070,4.209756097560976
8383024,3,B002WERREY,"Though the scenary is amazing in this DVD, it is not what I expected from the description.  I thought I would view a sampling of activities and I would be able to select the one activity that I wanted to participate in such as running a marathon.  I had someone else read the description and they interpreted it the same way I did.  I feel somewhat like I am seeing posters that many businesses have on their walls - ""achieve,"" ""believe,"" ""persevere,"" breathe.""  Finally, towards the end, there is an extended session of running, where I try to focus my efforts.",1325548800,4,562,4.534653465346534
8383025,1,B002WERREY,"DON'T BUY THIS.  This DVD advertises to let you choose between 3 diffen't veiws. The different views come as you are vewing it, mostly you are behind this female and then you are in the lead and then there are flashes of being in a group.  You can not contol these veiws in the setup as there is no setup menu. The entire video is filmed at low budget, anyone with a healthy credit card and an action cam could have made this DVD.  There are scenes where the person's shadow that is filming this is captured, with his helmet cam.  Through the trails there are other people runing into them. I real production would have consindered the sun's position for casting shadows and would have paid to reserve the trail.

Aside from all the expectations that were not filled as the other people's reviews asured me of, the biggest reason why not to buy this is, it ruined my DVD drive when I tried to play this on my computer's DVD player.  I already tried the uninstall and restart techniqe but the DVD drive still refuses to read any other DVD's now.",1324857600,2,1044,4.383419689119171
