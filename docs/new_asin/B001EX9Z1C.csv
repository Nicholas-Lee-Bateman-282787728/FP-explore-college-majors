8299880,5,B001EX9Z1C,"'What remains of us' (sub-titled in English and French) is a film secretly shot in Tibet that allows us to witness the magnitude of the Tibetan tragedy - the loss of its unique history, culture, language and spiritual way of life; death of countless innocents under the Chinese occupation as a result of torture, starvation, and execution; and denial of the most basic human rights of self-determination, freedom of speech, assembly, movement, expression and travel. The question asked in the film's title is relevant not only to the Tibetans. It may well be asked of their oppressors as well -- What remains of their own conscience and humanity? What remains of them?",1429833600,,668,4.973214285714286
8299881,4,B001EX9Z1C,"77 minutes. Filmed in Tibet. The young Tibetan from Montreal captured a short message from the Dalai Lama to the people of Tibet and brought it on a small DVD Player to Tibet. She showed it to monks, pilgrims, and young students. It was heart-rendering watching the faces of the pilgrims as they watched the video, wild-eyed in amazement, some prostrating and sobbing, many hearing their spiritual leader's voice for the first time.

Having visited Tibet several times myself, I found this documentary very balanced. In addition to showing the older devout pilgrims, it also shows young giggly students who don't seem to know anything about their culture.",1254268800,,655,5.064814814814815
