8701388,3,B00TEQMIMO,"The image/camera work/sound quality of the disc is fine. No problems there. The trouble is the performers! For me the new drummer Bobby Rodinelli (Rainbow/Sabbath/etc) is weak. He has moments where he's fine but he just plays awkward fills at times and is unable to keep a straight beat at some points!( Check out song number 15!)  The worst part is the guest singers. When there are so many vocalists it almost heightens/ invites scrutiny of how they perform.  While Graham Bonnet's tone is still there, why did they pick ""Since you've been gone?"" What a shame. and then why is ""Long live Rock and Roll"" is split between Doogie and Graham?  I wish they had just let Bonnet do the whole song. Doogie was good (as usual) but this whole thing has an almost ""silly"" aspect to it, and when the show ends there is about 20 people on stage singing. I watched the bonus features and while interesting why is Tony Carey singing smoke on the water? (very weird) For me, the only bright spot was Tony Carey's Hammond organ playing. It was great! Every moment Carey was on the keys was great. This guy still has the gift/feel and I wish he were considered if Blackmore ever decides to play some rock shows again.( Not that Carey wouldn't or shouldn't have reservations about that :) I don't know, in a way it was sad to see the decline of some of these people. I wanted to like this disc but there's no way to overlook the performances. Axel isn't himself either and doesn't play real well on this show. I rarely am this hard on concert performances and I have liked ARP's previous live shows. I really think he is a great melodic hard rock player. Maybe some will give this 4 or 5 star rating, but I really can't recommend it.",1431216000,5,1716,4.4412698412698415
