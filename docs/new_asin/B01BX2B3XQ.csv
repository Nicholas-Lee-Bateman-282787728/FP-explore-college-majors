7670510,2,B01BX2B3XQ,That first episode was really depressing and morbid. Too bad because I really wanted to see these two actors as I like them both. But I doubt I will pay good money to watch the other episodes.,1479859200,5,192,4.216216216216216
7670511,1,B01BX2B3XQ,"A confusing plot and some wildly unbelievable elements.  A woman has a grand mal seizure and then runs to her car to answer her cell phone.  Sorry,  I'm subject to seizures.  This is totally unrealistic.  A deputy arrives to bring her back to where her client is being unsuccessfully put to death.  What were the scriptwriters smoking?  I stopped watching after two episodes.",1479772800,16,375,4.857142857142857
7670512,5,B01BX2B3XQ,"I'm a true crime fan, but this series  drew me in with sympathetic, believable characters rooted in great writing and A plus acting. Rich content about civil rights and policing, politics and corruption, friends and family, and finally love and lies. I initially found  the barrister's two teenaged daughters, who were cheerful and cooperative in every instance, laughingly unbelievable until I watched episode 4.
Looking forward to seeing more back stories and understanding the twenty years of intrigue that binds this diverse group of interesting people.",1479513600,21,557,5.465116279069767
7670513,5,B01BX2B3XQ,"Just watched this and can't wait for the rest. The first episode did a great job of setting up the plot...great to have since Silk is no longer running.  Bottom line, British Series rock.  From Sherlock to Moon Boy, Luther to the Wrong Mans to the Durrells in Corfu.  Bring it on.",1477699200,19,280,4.346153846153846
7670514,5,B01BX2B3XQ,"Thrilling from the word go,loved the intermingling of English and American civil rights struggle.
Virtuoso performances from the lead actors almost a duel of matching intensity.
The kind of story that i'd like to see more of instead of tired out formulas and themes.
Bravo!!",1527379200,,274,5.111111111111111
7670515,5,B01BX2B3XQ,Simply amazing,1527292800,,14,6.5
7670516,3,B01BX2B3XQ,"Wonderful acting, great idea, but some holes in the story itself.  I think it would have been better if it had been written in 3 full length sections Rather than the time allowed. I wanted to get a better look inside the people themselves, especially to understand why the devotion to go undercover was so powerful. If you teallhvwamgbyo see a multi season show about undercover agents, see The Americans. Everything about that show made sense, (until the final season, see that show for reviews).",1523059200,,497,4.847058823529411

7670520,2,B01BX2B3XQ,"I have so many questions I hardly know where to start. Some of them have been asked by other reviewers so forgive any duplicates. 1. who paid for all of the travel back and forth across the Atlantic?  2,How much money could Maya been earning? They  have a great house and nice clothes so who brings home the $$$? Nick isn't contributing because he basically runs and fools around on the computer. 3. Okay so the jig is up. Why doesn't Nick sit down and tell Maya what's been going on? Why doesn't he tell her after the first person is murdered? Or the second? or the third? 4. I have never been to the supreme court so I don't know what the arguments are like, but Maya's seemed flimsy to me. Surely all of this has been said before and we still have the death penalty in the US. My understanding is that new evidence or a new interpretation of old evidence  or something that has not gone to the court before, must be had before the Big Court will hear the case.  There's more but I think that's enough. I'm glad to see a happy family that loves one another and has a good life. Who wouldn't be glad about that. But Maya sure needs a new best friend. It seemed to me that the best friend and Nick had a good relationship so why just blurt out dirty business without maybe asking Nick about it?  And Sophie Okonedo does have a very expressive face. Unfortunately it's the same expression in everything she does. Both the lead characters gave very emotional and
 believable performances, but the drama was a little too much for me. All the crying and had wringing went on and the next thing we knew Maya is on a plane and Nick is back to running.  I think the story was fine in the beginning and just got weaker as more twists and turns surfaced. It was capped off by a very weak ending.",1521244800,,1786,4.2507374631268435
7670521,1,B01BX2B3XQ,"If you need a coherent plot, don't put yourself through this botched attempt at a thriller/ social drama/ court room drama, which ends up being none of the above. Instead, there is a lot of 'stylizm'  (over the top and redundant atmospherics) which says nothing and goes nowhere.
Certainly, the worst BBC production I have ever watched.
And this is not the Sophie Okonedo I expected to see after watching ""Alibi"". Even her acting prowess could not save this film",1520726400,,462,4.775

7670523,5,B01BX2B3XQ,"I absolutely adore this family.  This show is so on the edge with many twists and turns.  Dennis Haysbert has been a favorite of mine since the days of The Unit.  I give props to all of the cast, they are wonderful.  I can't wait for Season 2.  Season 1 left me on the edge of my seat wanting more.  I had to come back to the page to double check that there were only 6 episodes.  Please please bring this back asap Amazon!",1519948800,,423,3.9642857142857144

7670532,5,B01BX2B3XQ,Great British Crime Drama. Excellent acting. Talented  cast. Slight suspension of belief that something like this could happen but her mate was like an actual with an actual spy. Hope there is a part two,1517097600,,203,4.8

7670536,2,B01BX2B3XQ,"Dennis Haysbert was the main bright spot. I agree with the reviewer - D. Mansfield - the whole series was great, but the last hour was totally asanine, the revelation of the ""why"" of the consiperacy fell flat and actually made NO sense, it's like they ran out of money and could not hire writers to do a proper finale, so it just ended in one nonsensical sentence.

While I could forgive the ridiculous Supreme Court scene, and even some of the holes in the story, what kept me engaged is finding out the actual plot and the why, which was never delivered.",1516665600,2,556,4.398058252427185
7670537,5,B01BX2B3XQ,"This series kept me so attentive and glued. I watched the series back to back. I actually thought that I could go straight into season 2. Love Dan's role, Adrian was magnificent, and Maya... US and English lawyer. Loved it.",1516492800,,223,4.6
7670538,5,B01BX2B3XQ,"Absolutely loved it. Sophie Okonedo was just outstanding in this drama. The storyline was great the drama kept my full attention and the cast was just on point. I'll be taking another run at this drama, thank you Amazon!",1516406400,,220,4.666666666666667
7670539,1,B01BX2B3XQ,"Loved the main actors. The storyline had so much potential, BUT it hardly explained the WHY at the end. Audience is left hangin  at the end. Also, her legal arguments in the U.S. courts were, as always in TV and movies, very unrealistic. Im 45 years old, and my fave genre all my life has been thriller/mystery. Ive never finished a movie/show where I felt that the mystery/cover-up was unanswered in the end. This one is just frustrating in that way.",1515974400,4,451,4.567901234567901
7670540,5,B01BX2B3XQ,"Omg this series was amazing, not advertised good enough. I can't believe I'm just finding this. Please,please have a season 2.",1515801600,,126,5.0476190476190474

7670542,2,B01BX2B3XQ,"The lead actress is horrible and her acting is quite distracting, but the rest of the cast is really talented. It was frustrating to not be able to get lost in the storyline and my mind couldn't help but cycle through the many talented women who would have done a much better job than the one cast. The final product kind of gives the impression that tptb would rather let a show suffer in regards to quality of talent than hire a black female lead.",1515110400,,449,4.294117647058823
7670543,4,B01BX2B3XQ,I loved this series until the last hour. Incredible performances and writing. Wonderful characters and agonizing plot twists. Sophie Okonedo broke my heart throughout. An amazing heroine. Adrian Lester handled a very tough role - until finally I did hate him. I'm so disappointed to say the last hour was horribly disappointing. Ridiculous scene of Maya speaking before the Supreme Court - absurdly contrived and phony dialogue. And awful denoument. I hated all the contrivances of revealing the cover up and revealing Nick's identity. Very anti-climactic and compared to the preceding five hours - drivel. I'm sure Peter Moffat could have done better.,1515024000,,652,5.339805825242719
7670544,5,B01BX2B3XQ,finished all 6 episodes and feeling like an addict.......of course I know 6 episodes is all I am getting but I come back and check just in case I am being punked and there is still 6 more episodes to go.....  why oh why would one create such a masterpiece only to leave us with 6 episodes? My popcorn is stocked and ready should they decide to bless me with more. The thirst is REAL,1514851200,2,382,4.093333333333334

7670546,2,B01BX2B3XQ,"I love these actors and British crime shows in general, but this one was just over the top bad. Jam packed with melodrama from the get go. Totally unbelievable. A British lawyer representing someone in Louisiana who can just fly back and forth between her job and rural Louisiana at the drop of a hat? (I was hoping the show would be more about her work but we hardly ever see her actually doing her job. Mostly she drives around and cries.) Her kids look almost as old as she does. And her husband is a writer who's been ""blocked"" for 20 years? Has he ever actually published anything? Nobody ever asks him about it? And all his ""undercover"" work is so cliched  as is the dialogue: ""We're going to blow up the police station and make bacon of the pigs inside.""  Why would the husband be willing to take such a racist assignment in the first place and why didn't anyone in that organization ever challenge him? Why's he so willing to keep lying and causing the deaths of people? Etc. Couldn't even finish the series.",1514592000,3,1016,4.427807486631016
7670547,5,B01BX2B3XQ,"I absolutely loved this show. It was gripping .... and difficult to stop so I watched the whole series in one shot. So many great actors but Sophie Okonedo was simply remarkable. It is a British TV series and the story takes place primarily in London although Ms. Okonedo's character Maya represents an inmate in the USA also so she often makes trips to see him. Considering that she is the main character of the story it is surprising that the show is titles ""Undercover.""",1513987200,4,473,4.576470588235294

7670549,5,B01BX2B3XQ,I just happened to see this series on a snow day and spent an afternoon binge watching all six episodes. I love watching Sophie Okonedo she's one of my favorite actors. I felt every one of her emotions as she in overs the truth. The story line kept me in suspense until the very last episode. Adrian Lester played the part of the UC I can't wait until season 2. Good job!,1513555200,,371,4.166666666666667
7670550,5,B01BX2B3XQ,"I started this early & have watched every episode well into the evening. I enjoy legal thrillers but nothing prepared me for a heart stopping day full of suspense & spies & coutroom battles. Whip up your snacks, chill your wine, get your popcorn ready. This series will have you holding your breath & yelling outloud! Action & romance? Yes please! Bring on season 2 ! I am totally hooked.",1513468800,6,388,4.557142857142857

7670553,5,B01BX2B3XQ,"Great show with a great plot. Like any other show from the BBC, there is quite a bit of thinking and listening closely to catch events that are later referenced... but isn't that the joy of watching shows like this?!

7670554,5,B01BX2B3XQ,Really good- deals with important social issues- all the acting was good especially Sophie Okonedo- its amazing to watch the emotions ebb and flow on her face !,1512691200,,160,4.75
7670555,4,B01BX2B3XQ,This is one of those series that will grab you and you have to be on your game to follow all of its twists and turns. Acting was excellent. We were disappointed with the ending. It was an ending that made no sense and left us confused.,1512172800,,235,4.0212765957446805
7670556,5,B01BX2B3XQ,First-rate acting.  Enough suspense to keep most of us engaged to the end.  Takes on issues of social injustice that are all too familiar and tragic.,1511913600,,149,4.6923076923076925
7670557,5,B01BX2B3XQ,What an awesome show. it just gets deeper and deeper. Great writing and casting. You will love the family and be on edge. Highly recommended.,1511913600,,141,4.68

7670563,5,B01BX2B3XQ,"I loved this series, was hooked from the very start! I think the main female character Maya is AMAZING, strong and powerful. Her husband Nick is super supportive and unconditional when it comes to her. She is someone who pushes herself, believes in justice and literally travels from the UK to the US to make it happen. The series is suspenseful and has great drama. I really enjoyed it.",1510876800,,387,4.6231884057971016

7670565,5,B01BX2B3XQ,Sophie Okonedo and Adrian Lester are absolutely brilliant! Sophie kept me captivated all six episodes and Adrian took me on an emotional roller coaster! Truly enjoyed the story and their chemistry.,1510617600,,197,5.387096774193548
7670566,1,B01BX2B3XQ,"Massively disappointed. The writing is abyssmal--flat and slow, with giant righteous speeches that say little. The spy intrigue is too obtuse to be intriguing, especially when the vague spying is going on over 20 ridiculous years. Giant questions left unaddressed, including how a man who professes to be a writer never writes or publishes yet brings in money maybe, or is a triathelete stay-at-home-dad failed writer who never writes but who has no money? secret money?--we never know. Also, their kid (who looks way older than 18 or 19) who just starts Oxford doesn't seem to drop out but attends to family stuff, though all that is never explained, her education and future never mentioned. Doesn't make sense. Sophie Okonedo is an engaging actor, as are many of the people in this series, but she shouldn't have accepted this oatmealy dull and vague script. The family unit in the film is joyful, loving, strong, and unified, though could have been far more complex and believable. The developmentally delayed son is written more as a plot tool than a real person, like the drug-addicted police officer-turned-AA-soothsayer, too (she wears the same jeans 20 years later and hasn't aged, just has yellowed teeth, the only problem from her 2-decade drug addiction!)--but both characters, and others, are in keeping with the bloated topical caricature of the story.",1510617600,7,1366,5.102678571428571
7670567,5,B01BX2B3XQ,"Excellent acting, believable dialog. Based on recent true facts in the U.S. with names of the State and persons changed. Very high production values. Not an uncivilized propaganda film as at least one politically disoriented reviewer claims. This story is definitely for a discerning audience.",1510444800,,293,5.533333333333333
7670568,5,B01BX2B3XQ,I stumbled upon this series and could not stop watching it.  The twists and turns will keep you glued to the TV.  The acting is superb and it is exceptionally written.  I wish there were more episodes.,1510444800,,201,4.378378378378378
7670569,5,B01BX2B3XQ,This was excellent.  I really hope there is more to come.  Season 2 please,1510444800,,74,4.214285714285714

7670573,5,B01BX2B3XQ,"I have watched many series both on Netflix and Amazon Prime. My taste runs mainly to crime dramas like Broadchurch, Hinterland, and Scandinavian programs like The Tunnel. I have never done a review before, but felt I needed to do so for Undercover. This series was a recommendation and I am so very glad I viewed it. It is far and away one of the best series I have seen. Extremely well written and the acting was superb. The characters believable and I found myself really caring for them as I watched each tightly written episode. Time flew and it was all I could do to slow down my viewing to savor the series. I do not know if there will be a season 2, but I surely hope so. I would watch it in a heartbeat. Thank you, Amazon Prime for this gem.",1510272000,2,749,4.208333333333333

7670577,4,B01BX2B3XQ,"The story develops well although at times it is predictable. Overall, layers of past action with present keep your interest, the actors are all on point & the story is fairly intriguing. The most glaring problem, however is in the Louisiana segments - in which virtually every character - black or white - are as cliche-cut-out as you could imagine. This contrast is blatant, jarring in fact since such care has been taken to portray ALL the British characters - even the villains - as 'fully developed', complex, multidimensional. Not so, the Southern characters. The show runners, writers, directors, producers fall right into the trap of stereotypical portrayals of Southerners  and this difference is distinct and obvious. Not one of the Brit characters is so clich, so flat. ALL the Southern characters  black or white  come straight out of caricature draft. From the over the top prison guards to the witness. What the hell, people. You look like the bigots. Shame on the whole lot of them. Absurd. Takes the entire ship down.",1509235200,3,1032,4.953757225433526

7670579,5,B01BX2B3XQ,"Typical left leaning view on the death penalty. More so because its British made. Not objective at all, it had the undercurrent that America is bad because we have the death penalty. The other parts of the drama were enjoyable.",1509062400,,227,4.7

It's all about the secrets in the police force both in London and in the U.S.. The main character crosses the Atlantic frequently enough to make you wonder if she has her own personal vacuum chute across the Pond!

As she fights for the life of a man convicted of murder in the United States, back at home in London, her life is a lie, and she doesn't even know it. Her process to discovery is riveting. The last scene of the last episode is hope-filled and mystery-filled. I don't know if there is another season, but if there is I'm totally on it!",1508803200,,661,4.418032786885246

Ultimately though the overall story and episodes were very uneven. The first few episodes are kind of slow and with too much back-story and set up, and then the last few fortunately move at a brisk pace, but are overly dramatic. The plot is full of holes with many unbelievable elements, and the ending leaves you hanging with many questions.",1505952000,,478,4.635294117647059

Rooted in character, this touches on a lot of hot button issues without being overly didactic.

To my surprise, each episode got better with interesting characters, a complex plot and engrossing family dynamics. The plot did require me to suspend disbelief at certain points but then I thought of certain instances where truth is stranger than fiction and it didn't seem as implausible.

7670623,3,B01BX2B3XQ,"I have only watched 3 full episodes of Undercover, so my review is based on that.  First impression was that there are way too many similarities to a Fox show called Shots Fired.  I did enjoy that show.  It has both the police, law, protests a killing, coverup etc. in both shows.  Shots Fired was very good as far as story line, acting, story movement and understanding of what was going on.  Undercover story line is good also, acting good, story understanding just slightly more confusing of what happened 20 years ago.  It is so similar except the stars in this show are married in Shots Fired they were not.  Still I am sure a coverup of major proportions is about to be divulged soon as it was in Shots Fired.  So will have to finish this and see what exactly took place and then may re-write this review.",1505520000,,811,4.395973154362416

Without noticing the viewer is swept into the challenges spooks face, the double lives, required duplicity, uncertainty that anyone from the handler to those directing the op can be trusted. That is the nature of the game, really. Dynamics of family, love, conflict of interest up to and including mortality combine to make this series outstanding. Admittedly, these sorts of series and films have always interested me; but, in our day they have become cookie cutter and predictable - this one will keep you guessing until the crescendo. Well done BBC. The darker truth is that this is occurring in our respective governments, and it is terrifying that state sanctioned hitmen are able to snuff out a person as though they never existed and walk away sweaky clean; rinse and repeat.

It rapidly becomes so engaging and suspenseful that you don't want to miss a moment of  the nuanced plot progress.  It did take me the entire first two episodes to realize that the slightly intrusive, pounding, repetitive soundtrack was creating an edge-of-the-seat feeling -- after which, I consciously relaxed. Similar to the excellent British crime series ""Luther,"" in this show outstanding black actors play well-crafted leading characters without resorting to predictable racial (or any) stereotypes.

I remember her as the wife in Rwanda and was extremely impressed with her as an actor.  Glad to see she's still around and wish she were a replacement for Sherry Washington who chews up all the sceneery and then some.  As for Adrian Lester he's such a natural, very comfortable in his own character's skin.  I was disappointed when Hustle stopped.

The script needed work; it got tiresome in its intrigue. The mystery through-line is very thin. We never really get to know who these bad guys are.
Complicated and exhausting it appeared to be standing still with one undeveloped mystery after another, like walking or, in this case, running in place.  Lots of sizzle, not much steak, if you get my drift.  I still don't know what the bad guys are being bad about except for getting people killed.

I guess he tried at the end, but a little too late until the very last scene.  Wham, I now am looking forward to knowing who he is/ why he was such a loser.
The acting was superb. Everyone especially the son was on point.  The characters were believable even if I didn't like whose side they were on.
6 episodes was a bit much filtering out the truth. The cultural divide between America and Britain were expertly delivered.  The issues of 1996 are prevalent today and the director wasn't afraid to touch the issues, more than mere surface.",1504051200,,818,4.3202614379084965

Adrian Lester was phenomenol. Excellent program overall. A second season would be great.,1503792000,2,266,5.068181818181818

7670676,5,B01BX2B3XQ,This show had so many aspects to love. The historical pieces were a small part and yet brought depth to the story.  The racial issues that were present need brought to the public eye and fought. The mystery and the awesome actors kept you watching and wanting more. I felt the deep love shown in a married couple showing them very happily in love and intimate was refreshing in contrast to all the non married sex in most of today's sitcoms. Could have done without the (very few) nudity images though. I wish there were more shows out there which portrayed marriage so well. Of course there is the factor that she has to not be sure of his love due to the situations that are portrayed. Loved this series all the way through.,1503792000,2,726,4.417910447761194

I think I have been spoiled with The Game, The Worlicker Trilogy, and The Night Manager so I had high hopes but this series was meh.  I tend to like strong female characters but I found her wildly emotional and in my mind, her character would have been more credible with out the crying and emotional outbursts.

7670702,2,B01BX2B3XQ,"Very good performances from excellent actors, wasted on a script that has huge implausibilities and gaping plot holes.

As other comments have noted, Sophie Okonedo is excellent, as are Dennis Haysbert and Adrian Lester (among others)  as expected from Okonedo and Haysbert, though I don't think Ive seen Lester before.  All actors that are a pleasure to watch.

But the plot!  Aside from the gaping implausibility of the secrets in the Okonedo/Lester relationship, having a British barrister (or is she a solicitor?) representing a client in a death penalty case in Louisiana, and then pleading the case before the U. S. Supreme Court is clearly fantasy (and you're not clear why they went that way, although one assumes the script writers wanted the chance to bash capital punishment in the U.S.).  Each time the plot really starts to gel in a suspenseful way, the writers introduce a new plot element that seems either silly or, yet again, implausible.  And the resolution at the end is a non-resolution  the plot elements that you need all brought together in a satisfactory explanation are just ignored in a rush to get to the conclusion.

I wouldnt waste the time!",1490486400,3,1170,4.928571428571429

8751818,2,B01BX2B3XQ,"This is a miniseries led by two great black actors and their characters' family, and includes some other great black actors as well. All of which is devoutly to be wished.

However the plot itself is full of so many complete implausibilities (the first of which comes right off the bat --  a British barrister flying back and forth to practice law in Louisiana without the slightest credentials!) that the opportunity for a  wonderful vehicle for these actors and characters is wasted, and the audience drops out due to the lack of believability.

This script should have been nixed or rehabbed from the get-go. It is admittedly difficult to write a script that will give black actors such as these this much of a universal showcase, but it's not impossible. Let's go back to the drawing board and do better, since this was a major disappointment and a major opportunity wasted.",1533859200,,878,4.7947019867549665

At the end of this series it got worst, I fast forwarded the part where the inmate accused Jesus' of wanting to see nudity.  This was at the end of the series. The plot was ok, however, it never justified the secrecy. The timeline is still relevant, and that is sad that in 2018 we are still dealing with the unjustified killing of Blacks by the establishment. No other major religious figure was used as profanity but Jesus Christ and that needs to stop.",1532217600,,527,4.5473684210526315

You keep waiting for the past several hours of the series to finally come together and reveal the truththe reason everything that came before happened. The build-up was amazingly effective with its anticipation. You expect the final moments to reveal all.... But it ends. Just like that. You get nothing. Zip. Zilch. Nada.

Seriously? Because I m sure England suffered no violence in the past 20 years so a 20 year old case should be a prerogative for the AG's office. Such a BS! In addition her husband is undercover for 20 years because the British intelligence wants to know what she thinks??? who cares what some attorney thinks and why would the government spend money on an undercover agent to tell them her thoughts Don't they have real cases???  the whole thing is real BS",1528675200,,774,4.475177304964539
