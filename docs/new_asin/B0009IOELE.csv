2292914,4,B0009IOELE,"This is the story of a single parent mother, Lily Bell (played by Stephanie Zimbalist), and her son John (Nick Stahl) living in rural America. Lily's brute of an ex-husband Frank Trenton (David Nerman) shows up in town and wants to pick up their relationship where it left off when she took John away and left him. Lily rejects his advances and calls her aged father, a Baltimore judge (Harry Warren) for help. He goes to her aid with his companion, lawyer Harmon Cobb (Walter Matthau). A restraining order is denied as Trenton is the boy's father.  Then things turn nasty, and Trenton turns up dead. Who dunnit? It's quite a slow movie: it's not packed with tension or action but the plot just unfolds in an intriguing way and the acting by all concerned is excellent. The movie was directed and produced by Delbert Mann from a story by Cindy Myers.",1347235200,,850,4.592105263157895
2292915,5,B0009IOELE,"This film depicts the relationship between friends and what happens to these friends when something real bad happens to one of them. Harmon J. Cobb  (Walter Matthau) is a very brilliant defense attorney whose friend Judge Stoddard Bell(Harry Morgan) is accused of murder.  Cobb jumps right in to support his friend;  however, during his investigation Cobb learns that the Judge is really covering for his daughter whom he thinks to be the real killer.  The dead man was romatically linked to the Judge's daughter - she had born him a son who is now 13 years old;  the plot thickens as Cobb discovers that the Judge's daughter is actually covering for her own son; it appears, that the son killed his abusive father in self-defense?",1283644800,,731,4.816
2292916,4,B0009IOELE,"This was 1 of 3 movies in this small ""series"" -- a nice clean family movie with an easy to follow story line.  Was very enjoyable to watch.  Get all 3 movies: Incident in a Small Town, Against Her Will, and Incident",1283126400,,215,4.095238095238095
2292917,5,B0009IOELE,"This third of three dramas with Matthau playing a lawyer, and Morgan a judge/lawyer, now teamed together as partners, is a partnership that ends (UNFORTUNATELY) with this final movie-length episode of fighting crime.  They take place during in 1944, 1947, and 1953, respectively with the three movies. This is perhaps the best of the three, but that is hard to say for sure, and completely subjective.  My suggestion is that you quickly buy all 3, you will want to see all three after seeing just one, watch them in order, and decide for yourself.  I'm sure you will decide you got your money's-worth-plus.

This ""Incident in a Small Town"" segment deals with a murder, and court room drama over who actually did the killing and the motive behind the act. It is tied together with such a integrated set of circumstances and relationships that guessing the startling conclusion is not worth the energy.  Just sit back and enjoy drama done perfectly by the Matthau/Morgan paired leadership of the cast.

The period scenes, sets, props, and all other details are so perfect you will enjoy the series for just the nostalgic romp back into time, even though the subjects presented in the cases are not the easy-living, innocent memories, most late 40s/early 50s productions try to present.  These are all 3, emotional to the hilt, deep relationships addressed, and heart-warming for a conclusion.  What's not to like, right?

5-stars for all 3 dramas.  Also see my reviews of:
""The Incident""
""Against Her Will: An Incident in Baltimore""",1256774400,7,1530,4.94140625
2292918,4,B0009IOELE,"A great show of characters. Cobb and Bell make the best duos in these feature films.

Bell's daughter is having a problem with her son's father. She has to ask judge Bell for his help. It looks like they won't be able to bring justice but of course our heroes are up to par.",1233100800,2,274,4.074074074074074
2292919,5,B0009IOELE,"I just finished watching Incident in a Small Town on a homemade video tape and was glad to see it is on DVD. I have watched them in Against Her Will and The Incident and was pleased to see them in a third pairing. I loved the old-time look to the movie about an earlier time where certain things were viewed in a different way. Judge Bell and his daughter Lily had a falling out, but now she is in a situation where she needs his help. A man from her past named Frank shows up, and turns out to be the father of her son John. At first Frank seems interested in getting to know John, who does not know the man is his father, but soon exhibits less-than-chivalrous behavior and ends up dead. It is Judge Bell himself who confesses to the crime, with Cobb representing him in the trial. Then Lily confesses to the murder, and it is up to Cobb to put the pieces together to reveal who really killed Frank. The movie ultimately has a happy ending with father and daughter reconciled, and the judge getting to know his grandson. I would recommend this movie and the other two for those who would like to experience a slower-paced life with two actors who paired up so well together.",1232236800,14,1176,4.278026905829597
2292920,5,B0009IOELE,"I highly recommend this the 3rd of the Harmon Cobb/Judge Bell series of movies.  Harmon (Matthau) and Judge Bell (Harry Morgan) have been law partners for a period of time, but suddenly Judge Bell must leave to help his estranged daughter handle a delicate situation.  The man who raped Judge Bell's daughter is back, and before you know it the Judge is accused of murdering this man.  Harmon is on the spot to defend the Judge, but the situation seems out of control as Harmon is not allowed to let anyone know of the previous rape.  The Judge's daughter doesn't want her son to know the truth about his real father.  The Judge's life is in the hands of Harmon and the truth about who really killed the boy's father is becoming a true mystery.  This is another great trial movie, and you can slip back into the late 1940's and remember when you were a kid at a great time to be an American.",1221955200,4,891,4.36969696969697
2292921,5,B0009IOELE,"When a small town attorney whose practice is failing is selected by government officials to be the means of railroading to the gallows a German soldier accused of murdering a beloved local physician, the case turns out to more complicated. The background is WWII and Germany is threatening to execute some American prisoners. Anyone in this small U.S. small town who takes on the case of a German prisoner will be villified.

The actors in this film are uniformly excellent. In my opinion, This is Walther Matthau's outstanding role.

Anyone will find watching this DVD most rewarding.",1219795200,12,585,5.020618556701031

8061289,5,B0009IOELE,"The drama co-stars Stephanie Zimbalist as a single mom concealing a burdensome secret while raising an illegitimate 13-year-old son in a small Illinois town in 1953.  She calls her estranged Father, A Judge (Harry Morgan) who along with Walter Mathau's Character come to her aid.  The film is an intrique of stories from the past that no one wants to reveal and that results in The Judge going to trial for Murder.  Morgan  & Mathau come together to make an intriguing film though it is not the usual comedy one expects from these two actors.  I liked it even though quite different than expected",1391731200,,596,4.6923076923076925
