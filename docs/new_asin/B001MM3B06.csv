3698046,2,B001MM3B06,i bought season 1 both volumes and I really wish they would release them in seasons or at let volumes that have more than 5 episodes i love this show and used to watch it on cartoon network. Please Warner Brothers release the smurfs by seasons or by volumes with more then 5 episodes there are fans of the show out there and im one of them.,1258588800,2,340,4.08955223880597
3698047,5,B001MM3B06,"I'm buying things from my childhood to share with my children - and for some reason, the smurfs have disappeared off our TV screens.

I am very happy with my purchase, although any customers from the UK should be aware that DVDs from the US do not play in the EU thanks to some dumb regulations. I never knew that. I had to purchase some programme from the internet to be able to play my DVD, and can only play it on my computer. Unfortunately its virtually impossible to get the smurfs in this country, so I'll have to continue buying US DVD's. It sucks.",1256256000,,555,4.285714285714286
3698048,1,B001MM3B06,"It's really sad to me how greed continues even with children movies. It would make more sense to me if warner would just continue putting out there 20-25 episode season's of the smurfs,and stop trying to make a buck by wasting time and energy to put out these crappy cheap overpriced greatest hits episode from the 2 seasons that are already contained in the first 2 smurfs seasons sets...otherwise great show and memories....geesh...greed...greed",1244764800,22,447,5.136986301369863
3698049,4,B001MM3B06,"The latest DVD of ""The Smurfs"" is a rather nice touch to your collection.  (Especially if you have the first season sets available now.)

This DVD has 5 classic episodes in over 90 minutes of smurfy good fun.  Those episodes has the little blue denizens encounter new friends, new foes, and new adventures, too.  They'll suffer a severe snowstorm, encounter an evil potion maker, and who knows what evil scheme that wizard Gargamel is up to ?

Also on this DVD is an interactive Smurf village with character profiles and other facts you may or may not know about.  Very nice.

So this DVD may not be much and all, but it's okay none the wiser.  Look for more new Smurf DVDs coming soon.",1244160000,,686,4.475806451612903
3698050,3,B001MM3B06,"Booooo...why would you not continue to release the seasons sets and only put out a few episodes.  Are they not going to come out with the season sets anymore?  I could deal with the episodes being out of order in the first two DVD's...but I want more smurfs :(
Who can we write to so we can ask for the season sets...I don't want to buy those burned copies that are being sold.",1242086400,13,377,4.1506849315068495
3698051,4,B001MM3B06,"This dvd is okay.  It is not as entertaining as the previous releases.  The 5 episodes that are provided are a bit dull and Gargamel was not as prominent as most tru-blue Smurf fans would like.  However, my daughter stills likes it, but wants to watch one of the other Smurf dvds when this one ends.  I gave it 4 stars because the dvd does contain Smurfs.",1239148800,,355,4.253731343283582

3698053,2,B001MM3B06,"My 8 year old son and I both found this DVD to be extremely boring.  Gargamel is barely present.  The episodes are heavy on Johan and Pee Wee.  I was a huge fan of The Smurfs from 1981-1985, and I don't remember any of these episodes.  I guess I didn't pay enough attention to what I was buying.",1237680000,7,295,4.0344827586206895

3698055,3,B001MM3B06,"This is a single DVD with the following episodes on it:
S-Shivering S-Smurfs - An early winter comes to Smurf Village and Tracker is the only one prepared and saves the village.
Turncoat Smurf - Gargemel uses his dog to track down the Smurfs after finding Brainy's laundry.
The Smurf Who Couldn't Say No - Pushover Smurf is used to do all the work and puts out the Fox Fire awakening a monster.
The Haunted Castle - Johan & Peewit' meet a ghost in a drought filled countryside with the Smurfs help they end the drought.
The Black Hellebore - After the king is poisoned by the potion maker, to wake the king Johan & Peewit' need the antidote from Homnubus.  The potion maker later uses the evil Hellebore flower to try and take over the kingdom.

The title sequence of each episode is the newest of the three opening sequences that I know of.  The one on the Season 1 DVD's was something about Smurfs being good and Gargemel being Bad, the one from most of when I was growing up had Gargemel chanting ""total destruction from mountain to shore"", and this one was used when Peewit' & Johan were main characters has Papa singing while the dam is bing built.  I don't know if there was an additional opening for when the Smuflings were in the show.

This DVD has the same issue that the Season 1 DVD's did where the menu is much louder then the episodes.  I just wish that they would have continued to release the seasons, this was just a tease of what should have been released.",1236729600,29,1474,4.380952380952381

3698096,3,B001MM3B06,"I know that other people have had problems with the True Blue Friends actually being the DVD from Season One Volume Two, but I didn't have any problems with it.

The episodes on the disc are:

S-Shivering S-Smurfs
Turncoat Smurf
The Smurf Who Couldn't Say No
The Haunted Castle
The Black Hellebore

I enjoyed watching the five episodes, but they are only five episodes. It seems that Warner Bros. is either getting lazy or greedy in releasing the Smurfs to DVD.",1347926400,2,461,4.666666666666667

HOWEVER, when you put the disc in the DVD player, the menu comes up and says ""Season One, Volume Two"", and the episodes actually on the disk are ""The Magic Egg"", ""Smurfette's Dancing Shoes"", ""Supersmurf"", ""The Baby Smurf"", ""The Fake Smurf"", ""Paradise Smurfed"", ""Sir Hefty"", ""The Purple Smurfs"", ""Haunted Smurf"" and ""Sideshow Smurfs"".

WE ALREADY OWN BOTH VOLUMES OF SEASON ONE. That's why I bought this, thinking these were different episodes. Obviously there was been some kind of BIG mixup during the manufacturing process. GOOD LUCK GETTING WHAT YOU PAID FOR -- I didn't.",1316044800,8,800,5.099236641221374
3698098,1,B001MM3B06,"This DVD and the whole set in general is yet another grievous example of trying to suck as many dollars as possible for as little value as possible by the same types of executives who used to run record companies. 5 lousy episodes representing ""Season 2 Volume 1"" Using this math Season 2 would end up being as many as 12 DVDs. Really Hanna Barbera? This kind of greediness is the reason why the recording industry is now owned by Apple, who came in and picked up the pieces after file-sharing destroyed this kind of business-as-usual disregard for your consumers. What a garbage collection. Total waste of money not to mention space. I'd easily pay $30 for a proper Season 2 collection of all the episodes, but this kind of parsing out means I'm passing on this measly offering.

As others have pointed out this is not Season 2: Volume One. And no where on the package does it claim to be. But Amazon is labeling as such and claiming the $5.49 price is a 63% discount!

Smurfs: True Blue Friends contains one disc with only 5 episodes. Total run time is around 2 and half hours.",1305331200,6,392,4.077922077922078

Well we finally opened it and popped it into the DVD & were surprised when the menu came up Season 1, Volume 2 instead of Season 2, Volume 1. The DVD case and the cover of the actual DVD are correct, but the contents were completely different. There are 10 episodes instead of 5. For the price, it's a good deal, but the fact that it's the wrong episodes is a bit disappointing. I've read other reviews and I haven't seen anyone else with this problem, but beware when you buy the DVD. You might not get what you paid for.",1301011200,3,610,4.091666666666667

On the disk, the episodes are ""The  Magic Egg, Smurfette's Dancing Shoes, Supersmurf, The Baby Smurf, The Fake Smurf, Paradise Smurf, Sir Hefty, The Purple Smurfs, Haunted Smurf & Sideshow Smurfs"".  These are 10 episodes and they are all from Season one.  This is false merchandising and false advertisement.  Not very happy about this.  I love the smurfs and I greww up on them.

3698103,5,B001MM3B06,Has anyone had the problem of different content on their dvd? I received the True Blue Friends for christmas but the episodes match those on the 1st disc of the Season 1 vol. 2. I think there are more episodes than the other but I have never experienced a problem like this. I am just not sure what to do if I want to purchase the rest. The label on the disc even reads True Blue Friends so it must be a manufacturing flaw. I am just curious if I am the only one or are there others. A great product though.
