8677428,5,B00NCFW4MM,I like this product. It gives you a tour of the country side and indicates when you need to increase the pace. I plan on purchasing other DVD's in the future and building an exercise library.,1451692800,,191,4.333333333333333
8677429,4,B00NCFW4MM,"I love the Virtual Active tapes.  I use them for the rower, spinner and treadmill, the idea is you feel like you are moving along the trails.  You have several listening options to listen/or not to the trainer, music or record trail sounds.  With the bike series, you cover longer stretches of terrain but there is less description of the surroundings.  The hiking series is just the opposite and the running series is somewhere in between. I would say that the bike series is my least favorite format, because I like to know more about where I am.  I love touring the world this way.  I wish Virtual Active would do a series on the Appalachian Trail and the Pacific Coast trails in the US; as well as some water trails for my rower.",1422662400,2,733,4.432835820895522
