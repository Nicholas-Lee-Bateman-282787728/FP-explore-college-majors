3692141,2,B001M45O8G,"My customers keep hoping for Seagal to return to his glory days, but unfortunately the last few films have made it to where people will not even rent his stuff now. This one won't necessarily help, but it doesn't hurt his chances too much either.

Standard story: He is retired from being a mean guy, something bad happens to someone he cares about, the close up of his eyes becoming angry, then lots of bad guys meet their end. To be clear, this had the most gratuitous close-up of his face I have ever seen - it scared me. What bothered me the most is he seems tired. Not sure how else to word it, I don't think his heart is in these.

The Blu quality was below average. Plenty of grain, focus issues and other tech problems. I love DTS, but this wasn't mixed well. The fake sounds of Seagal beatings detracted from trying to watch.  No special features to speak of. Can not recommend this as a Blu purchase over the DVD quality.",1242345600,12,931,4.308571428571429

3692143,3,B001M45O8G,"Seagal plays Ruslan, a former Russian gangster who's now a successful crime novelist. He goes to attend his daughter's wedding and finds out her fianc is the son of his arch enemy, a crime boss. The young man, Stephan, does not want to be a gangster and is not on good terms with his father. When Ruslan's ex-wife and daughter are attacked, he wants to find those responsible, and enlists the help of Stephan, who believes the daughter/fianc to be dead.

The quality of Seagal's direct-to-DVD movies have been uneven. This time he teams up again with director Jeff King, who directed ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Switch/dp/B001AR010Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill Switch</a>"", which was one of the better of his recent movies. And ""Ruslan"", aka. ""Driven to Kill"" is also a very watchable movie, though not without flaws. Recommended to fans of Seagal and direct-to-DVD action movies. Let's hope his films keep improving and that we won't have to suffer through more movies like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Foreigner/dp/B00007JZUP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Foreigner</a>"" or ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mercenary-for-Justice/dp/B000E6ESD0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mercenary for Justice</a>"".",1241913600,14,1336,6.812865497076023
3692144,1,B001M45O8G,"Every year I'm hoping that Seagal will realize that all his Direct to Video movies are absolute garbage...Wait, he does know this, he simply doesn't care!! He just wants another paycheck and that is it. This is a real shame, seeing a once acclaimed Aikido martial artist come down this low.

This newest flick is not worth a penny, it is as bad as or even worse than any of his previous DTV flicks. This movie was originally slated for release earlier this year under the title of ""Ruslan"". The film has been officially changed to ""Driven to Kill"" A much worse title in my opinion. Anyway this flick tells the tale of Ruslan (Seagal) a mobster/novelist...Yeah that right, a novelist..Who would have known, not that it matters much. Anyhow, the film commences with a ludicrous conversation with a chick in a cafe. Our beloved Seagal is showing this gal a few of his talents...as soon as I saw that scene; I knew the rest wouldn't be much better.

By the way Seagal doesn't just play a mobster...He plays a Russian mobster the knowledge of this makes it 10x worse. He has no accent..I think he shows the accent at the beginning and at the end in perhaps a total of 3 scenes, the rest is him in his raspy mumbling voice that can barely be heard. Oh and for those hoping his voice wouldn't be dubbed are gona be disappointed. While not as much as Attack Force, his voice is still dubbed and modified in several scenes...And his interpretation of Russian is quite laughable.

The action scenes are whatever, mostly forgettable. The last fight scene is pretty gory and violent, but unnecessary...I mean Seagal sticks a gun inside a guy's eye!!! Why? It was like saying ""This movie is stupid and illogical...Let's wake up the audience with a gory scene"" Also the plot was inconsistent...not really interesting at all, not as confusing as his previous flicks...it just wasn't interesting.

The thin plot is as follows, Ruslan comes to visit his daughter for her wedding. The guy she is gona marry, his dad is in the Russian mafia. For Ruslan this is a red flag, it can mean trouble. Which in fact is because his daughter an ex wife are attacked by the mafia. I won't give all the details...But the execution is horrible...Even though the plot wasn't really interesting, it could have been delivered so much better. Not to mention Seagal's acting...it's getting crappier each year, he looks even more tired and dead. The only good thing the flick had was that there want as much doubles in the action scenes...but aside that..The fight scenes were still pretty crappy and unrealistic.

Honestly avoid this crap at all cost; it's not worth sitting and watching. Seagal is making these movies for the money, he has said so himself before. He needs money, he makes stinkers like this. There really is no hope for him. He will be back again this year with another flick ""the keeper""...I'm not anxious at all; it's more than likely a stinker like this one.

The fight scenes are well done and well shot, only a few times throughout the movie do you recognize the Segal photo-double, and it's so minor that it doesn't hamper the film.

The film is straight forward Seagal. There are no twists, no surprise endings. If this film, Seagal had not yet perfected the duck, then one knock out punch move as he does in his later offerings. The film takes about 30 minutes to introduce characters before Seagal goes after the bad guys. Average Seagal Flick.

3692175,2,B001M45O8G,"I've been watching a lot of action/adventure movies lately and last night brought the ""Driven To Kill"" DVD starring Steven Seagal. Well, I've watched Seagal movies before and always had a positive opinion. This one lowered the opinion a bit. It was a mediocre movie, at best, and I was glad when the closing credits finally appeared. Seagal played a tough Russian dude who is a bit distraught with the death of his wife and severe injury to his daughter and is out to avenge the indignity. He breaks a lot of heads, so to speak.

""Driven to Kill"" is a grim movie. I can well imagine the director instructing that none of the actors be allowed to smile, not even slightly. Everybody must look grim and hatred filled, at all times. Well, if that's what you like to view, so be it. I can't recall even a single light moment in the movie. It's all either fighting (some real good scenes) or grim discussion. What a downer. Seagal fits well, although he looks a bit heavy to be such an active and hostile guy. Whatever happened to movie stars adjusting their physique to filling the role they play in a movie? In any case, he's Mr. Real Tough Guy and he's really, really tough. You'll grimace at the end when he sticks a gun barrel into the eye of his adversary and pulls the trigger. It's one of the goriest scenes I've ever seen in a movie.

Most of the movie set is in one place. It might be an action film, but most of the action takes place in one hospital. Is seeing a hospital destroyed your cup of tea? Then you may enjoy the movie. Fights, gunfights, explosions, chase scenes and a wide variety of assorted mayhem all take place in the corridors of this unfortunate institution. The body count in this movie is high and it's good that it takes place in a hospital with all the severe to mortal injuries.

Okay, so it's a grim and violent movie. But are there any redeeming aspects to it? Well, I can't see any. The story is contrived and inconsequential. The acting, other than maintaining the grimness at all times and under all  circumstances, is mediocre at best. None of the characters are even likable. Would I view the movie again? No. Would I recommend the movie to others? No. It's a throwaway.

3692178,3,B001M45O8G,"SPOILER ALERT: I give away a few ""plot points"" in my review, so please take that into consideration if you haven't seen the film.

OK, this is another Steven Seagal Direct-To-DVD film from 2009. And in order to adequately enjoy it as a three-star movie, we need to play the glass half full, glass half empty game.

1). GLASS HALF EMPTY: Steven may be a master of martial arts, but dialects? Fuggedaboudit! In this film he's a former Russian mobster, now writing pulp fiction thrillers, who sets out to avenge the murder of is ex-wife and attempted murder of his daughter, on the even of the daughter's wedding.

2). GLASS HALF FULL: The overwhelming majority of Steven Seagal films are placeholders for the Seagal formula. He has to be ""someone""...anyone, it doesn't matter. Sometimes an enemy returns from the past (as in this film), or he goes after ""Mr. Big"" in some nefarious crime organization. But whether Seagal is a former Russian mobster writing trashy novels or a cab driver in Philly, it really doesn't matter. He just needs to be ""somewhere"" so that the action can revolve around him.

3). GLASS HALF EMPTY: Whether he is a master of martial arts or not, he can't stop a bullet, and the various bad guys in the movie only had about a zillion opportunities to prove that.

4). GLASS HALF FULL: It's like all of those ""Halloween"" knockoffs in which the teens walk outside the house (or go in the house) when they shouldn't, because the killer is waiting for them. If you spend too much time thinking while watching a Steven Seagal movie, you are watching the wrong movie.

5). GLASS HALF EMPTY: Seagal movies lean heavily on ""stunt kills,"" just like the Friday the 13th movies in which the whole point of the film is to see Jason Voorhees commit 13 murders in ""creative"" ways.

6). GLASS HALF FULL: Seagal is the master of over-the-top ""stunt kills."" If that's not your cup of tea, I believe Amazon sells some fine DVDs featuring Kenneth Branagh performing some of Shakespeare's finest works. This ain't Shakespeare, dude. This is...as John Candy and Joe Flaherty used to say in SCTV's ""Farm Film Report,"" this is a movie where things blow up real good.

So what have we learned from this review? Steven Seagal stars in an implausible role, spoken in an almost embarrassing Russian dialect, things blow up all over the place, lots of bad guys try to kill Seagal but end up gettin' kilt themselves in the process, and...

...and there is no ""and."" It is what it is. Another 3-star, direct-to-DVD Seagal flick, and a lot of fun if that's what you're in the mood for. During the recent (2011) Thanksgiving holiday, Spike TV ran a marathon of Seagal films. It was a hoot. So is this film. It is what it is, and as long as you approach it with realistic expectations, you will be entertained.",1323388800,2,2797,4.622983870967742
3692179,3,B001M45O8G,"Driven to Kill is another so so release from Seagal's library of DTV movies.  Better than some and not nearly a good as say The Keeper or Belly of the Beast.  I know it's difficult with so many movies being made these days that coming up with an original script is not easy.  Guess was hoping for some more originality but all in all worth at least one viewing.

3692180,1,B001M45O8G,"Driven to Kill: 3 out of 10: I have no hope of ever being Arnold Schwarzenegger in Conan the Barbarian no matter how much I work out; and no amount of dedication will ever give me the moves of a Chuck Norris or a Bruce Lee, but Steven Seagal? I can do that. Find me an all you can eat buffet next to a tanning salon and I will be in Seagal shape in no time.

Whether it is Liam Neeson rescuing his daughter in Taken, Harrison Ford taking on the bank robbers in Firewall or those geriatrics in Lethal Weapon 4 there is plenty of room for action heroes that are more AARP than Tai Kwan Do.

So I am not going to harp on the fact that Stephen Seagal's film reminds one of an alternate past where Orson Wells had starred in Good Guys Wear Black. Nor will I point out that his hand eye coordination is so out of whack he cannot even type at a keyboard convincingly on camera. Heck I will not even mention his Costner-esque* mastery of a Russian Accent.

What I do want to know why this is considered a return to form for Seagal by some critics. (Seagal is back and he is hungrier than ever crows one.) With a revenge plot so simple Charles Bronson would have blushed Driven to Kill is the geriatic revenge plot boiled down to a simplistic outline. The movies idea of a plot twist is a character, who practically wears a t-shirt that says I'm a bad guy ask me how, turns out to be ""gasp"" a bad guy. The fist fights remind me of Blazing Saddles (You Brute You Brute) and the gun fights are right out of Top Secret (Two guys five feet from each other hiding behind crates.)

Throw in some CGI gargoyles and this wouldn't be out of place on the SyFy Channel. The obvious fact that the actress that plays Seagal's ex-wife (Inna Korobkina) is a year younger than the actress that plays his daughter (Laura Mennell). They put an old lady wig on Korobkina and hoped no-one would notice. (On another strange side note IMDB also has Ed Anders as thug #3 and Mike Desabrais as thug #5 but no word on the fate or identity of thugs 1, 2 and 4.)

I have liked some Seagal films in the past such as Under Siege and its sequel. In addition I have found other Seagal films very entertaining albeit unintentional laugh riots (On Deadly Ground is one of the funniest most entertaining bad films I have ever scene.)

Driven to Kill is unfortunately not bad enough to be entertaining and lord knows it certainly isn't good enough either.

3692183,2,B001M45O8G,"In ""Driven to Kill"" Steven Seagal is a former Russian mafia turned popular crime novelist Ruslan Drachev. This is a typical revenge story involving his lovely daughter who is getting married, and her fianc Stephan (Dmitry Chepovetsky) who happens to be a son of a Russian mobster Mikhail (Igor Jijikine, ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull""). The story is serviceable and some of the supporting actors playing the baddies turned in solid acting.

As a straight-to-DVD flick, the film's actions are OK. There are several shoot-outs and they are decent, if not outstanding. There is no originality, to be sure, all run-of-the-mill type of gun actions, but they are not that awful. As to the martial arts scenes, it is nothing great. Quick cuts and shaky camera can hardly cover up the fact that Mr. Seagal can't move like he used to do (and sadly we all know that). One surprise is that it seems he did most of the stunts himself. They didn't even dub his voice, but as he mumbles in a Russian accent, sometimes it is hard to understand what he is saying.

This is not totally abysmal, far better than his previous work ""Against the Dark"" and on par with his 2007 ""Urban Justice.""",1265155200,3,1194,4.654028436018957
3692184,3,B001M45O8G,"In recent years, Steven Seagal has been cranking out a prodigious number of films for the direct to video market.  While the number generally regarded as good, has been in the minority, Driven To Kill (2009) is a step in the right direction, and can be added to the list of decent efforts in this period.  This film has an East coast vibe, with a very heavy Russian flavor, with lots of foreigner actors who look the part, Russian language spoken, and Russian music part of the soundtrack.

Seagal is Ruslan Drachev, an ex-ganster turned author, who returns to his old stomping grounds in New Jersey, to attend the wedding of his daughter Lanie (Laura Mennell).  Drachev's ex-wife Katya (Inna Korobkina) has remarried, and her husband Terry Goldstein (Robert Wisden), is a lawyer whose clients often include criminals.  Mikhail Abramov (Igor Jijikine, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) a mob leader, is the father of Lanie's fiance, Stephan (Dmitry Chepovetsky), who is not in the mob.  Just before the wedding, assassins strike, killing Katya, and severely wounding Lanie.

Seeking revenge and to protect his daughter, Ruslan enlists Stephan, and sets out to track down the killers in the seedy underbelly of town, pawn shops, strip clubs, and rundown apartments.  Ruslan discovers who is behind it all, but his daughter recovering in the hospital remains in danger.

Seagal seems to be in better physical condition, and appears to be actually performing a majority of the fight scenes.  Sure, the film is still sped up to make him look faster, but the fights are shot mostly without the irritating quick cutting, that only gives an illusion of the continuity of movement.  An overused technique that has plagued his recent films.  Drachev engages in some flashy knife fighting, and executes a few baddies up close and personal.  Lively Russian music plays during his extended fight scenes, giving things a festive atmosphere.  Most movie gunfights are usually unrealistic, and while that is much the case here, there are a few moments with some realistic tension.

Up until the action shifts to the hospital, the film is quite tight and gritty, except for the police being completely inept.  Drachev has his cowboy moments, but at least goes through the motions of doing some detective work.  Things do fall apart at the hospital, with an unrealistic assault, and some terrible acting by the hospital staff in hiding.  Drachev's fight with Abramov ends in eye popping fashion, concluding what is a better than usual effort for Steven Seagal.  There are more than a few problems with the script, but things don't completely unravel until near the end, which while not optimal, is still a positive given some of his recent films.  There are a few bad performances, but overall the acting is decent.  The fighting and action scenes are an improvement, helping to make director Jeff King's second collaboration with Seagal, mildly recommended viewing for crime and action fans.",1261699200,3,2993,5.006060606060606
3692185,3,B001M45O8G,"This movie actually turned out to be pretty decent, but I was really concerned the first 20 minutes or so into the film that this might be another ""Submerged"" (2005) or ""Attack Force"" (2006) because I couldn't understand if Steven was trying to fake a Russian accent or it was just another in a long line of bad voice overs! Actually, I'm still not sure, but as I am not planning to re-watch the movie, you can figure it out for yourself if you like. Plus, it looked like the beginning of the film spent some time on the cutting room floor in post production because some of it made little sense in setting up the rest of the film. Having watched both ""Attack Force"" and ""Submerged"" previously where basically the whole films were cut-up post production, you can see why I was concerned!

But about 20-30 minutes into the film it started getting much better and the story actually flowed pretty well. I'm just not a fan of this storyline too much - Russian mobsters. Nice strip club scene by the way though, thanks for that! LOL

This film reminded me a lot of two of his other films: ""Shadow Man"" (2006) and ""Black Dawn"" (2005) though those films were set in Eastern Europe and have more of an espionage-quality to them. This film was less entertaining than those two, but did have some pretty good fight scenes and not a lot of annoyingly obvious stunt double work as compared to some of his other direct to videos. All-in-all a decent effort and one that I can recommend for Seagal fans.

But after a brutal attack on his daughter-who was engaged to the son of a ruthful Russian nemesis-Ruslan must return to the sinister underbelly of his past and dole out his own merciless brand of justice.",1255478400,4,637,5.306930693069307

3692192,2,B001M45O8G,"Let me begin by saying: I'm not a fan of Steven Seagal--don't like him, his movies are not my cup of tea. I watched this because I'm a fan of Igor Jijkine, and wanted to see him in something outside of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
I went into the movie with low expectations, and so was not disappointed when the movie lived up (down?) to them. I did, however, have to fight the urge to vomit when Ruslan's girlfriend suggested a threesome...
I was disappointed that Igor Jijikine, while good in the movie, didn't have more to do. He mostly yelled, or stood around looking like a badass, which, admittedly, is something he does well. And, the guy playing his son looks like he's *maybe* five years younger--!
So basically, the two stars are for Igor. One because it's nice to see him with more dialogue than he had in Crystal Skull, and one for being the only good thing about my first--and, I pray, last--Steven Seagal film.",1250812800,,948,4.485549132947977
3692193,1,B001M45O8G,I certainly see why this movie was released directly to DVD. Seagal's movies for the most part are dreadful and this one is not any better. I had to be in a coma to purchase it.,1247270400,,177,3.9444444444444446
3692194,3,B001M45O8G,"I gave this 3 stars, but I suppose you could actually say it's four stars when compared to most of Slabface's Direct To Video output.
In the past, we've had to suspend disbelief as we watched Seagal play Italians, Native Americans, and an Inuit.  Now we have to suspend it even further as we watch Seagal play a Russian.  You heard right, a Russian!  Seagal is about as convincing playing a Russian as Martin Lawrence would be, maybe worse.  In Driven To Kill, he's a former Russian mobster who now writes crime novels, a plot point which is swept under the rug almost as soon as it's introduced.  Like making Seagal Russian, the idea of making him a novelist seems like a pathetic attempt to make his character a little different from past roles.  Problem is, nothing is done with it and Seagal just ends up being the same ol' Seagal anyway.  So, what was really the point?
Then it becomes a variation on the tried and true Death Wish theme.  Seagal's been invited to his daughter's wedding(she's marrying the son of Seagal's nemesis) where the party is crashed by thugs who kill Seagal's wife and severely injure his daughter.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!REVENGE TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Seagal struts around talking tough(it's quite hard to understand Seagal in this movie as his voice seems both quieter and hoarser.  Not to mention the fact that he attempts a Russian accent and at times tries to speak Russian), kicking butt and just being Seagal.  His old nemesis, a rival Russian mob boss is the one out to make Seagal's life miserable, and he has whole network of thugs working for him.  One of them is a corrupt layer, who just happens to be Seagal's ex wife's current husband.  Not terribly surprising, I know.
It's the typical Seagal shenanigans.  It's much better than most of the dreadful special forces/black ops themed junk Seagal has been putting out.  Like Urban Justice and Pistol Whipped, it's more in line with his early 90s smaller scale revenge flicks.  Which is to say that it's not really a great film, but it is a fun film.

  Steven Seagal's new film ""Driven To Kill"", is a satisfying action film returning to the quality of the blockbuster films of his early career.
  Camera work is clean; very little of the special effects clutter in action scenes common to his films from 2003 to now.  Stand ins do appear to be performing the strenuous activity in the fight scenes, so Seagal may not be in prime physical shape.
  Seagal portrays a Russian father returning to town to be present at his daughter's wedding.  When she is attacked, he hunts her attackers.
  His performance is forceful, believable, strong -- reminiscent of his Casey Ryback character in Under Siege.",1245715200,2,808,5.947826086956522

This latest entry isn't *quite* as good as either of the former two, but is nonetheless one of the best things that Seagal's done in the last half-decade.

The story: Ruslan Drachev (Seagal) is a former member of the Russian mob and current novelist whose daughter Lanie (Laura Mennell,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Watchmen/dp/B001QTXM5Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Watchmen</a>) is attacked and left comatose on the eve of her marriage to the son of his arch nemesis, the mafia kingpin Mikhail (Igor Jijikine,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Indiana-Jones-4/dp/B001DTPZNY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Indiana Jones 4</a>). Ruslan suspects Mikhail and sets out on a trek of vengeance with the aid of the mob boss's son and his daughter's fianc Stephan (Dmitry Chepovetsky,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ReGenesis/dp/B001F7MSH0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ReGenesis</a>).

The pressing questions that make or break a Seagal film: (1) is the storyline coherent, (2) how obvious is Steven's stunt double, and (3) how much of his voice is dubbed? I'm happy to say that in the case of all three, Seagal has improved: the story is straight-forward with virtually no subplots, Steven's voice is not dubbed at all as far as I can tell, and his ever-consistent stand-in Dian Hristov is not even listed in the credits. There aren't a lot of instances in the film where it seems to indicate that it's someone other than Seagal doing his own work to begin with, so if he is using a stunt double, it's not very often and it's been covered up very well.

Yes, Seagal is sticking to his higher standards. He seems more alert and in good physical shape, his character is fairly intriguing, and his fight scenes are well-choreographed and surprisingly vicious. He has seven of these: four shootouts and three hand-to-hand fights. The gunfights are mainly overlookable but get redeemed by a cool machinegun battle. When using his fists, Steven is formidable: he stabs a guy in the face with broken glass, literally beats a fellow to tears, cuts a man to ribbons in a very bloody knifefight, impales a man's head on a spike, stabs a mercenary in the neck and forces him to bleed to death, and stabs his final opponent through the eye with a gun barrel. This older, more sadistic Steven is loads more fun to watch than the supplier of endless ""pattycake battles,"" even though he uses next to no actual martial arts. There is some unnecessary and unwanted quick-cut editing to these fights, but the fact that it's clearly Seagal doing his own work saves them from being any less impressive.

There are some silly editing techniques used in other parts of the movie to kill time, but the important scenes remain untainted. The supporting cast works well: Jijikine as the head villain, Robert Wisden (""Da Vinci's Inquest"") as the two-faced husband of Ruslan's ex, and Chepovetsky as Ruslan's quasi-sidekick all do good jobs as immediate costars, while daughter Laura Mennell and mercenary Aleks Paunovic help make up a good supporting base. The casting of actual Russians helps a lot in setting an atmosphere for the film, since there's a lot of Russian being spoken and it all sounds authentic. Seagal does his best with his own version of a Russian accent, and it's nice to see him make an effort the second time around (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Half-Past-Dead/dp/B0000844MD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Half Past Dead</a>&nbsp;for the first time).

There's some definite ego masturbation for Seagal and I wish there had been more fistfights and/or some innovation of the gun battles, but regardless of these qualms, the film is proof that Steven Seagal is not done being a force in the action realm. It's not quite as no-nonsense as ""Urban Justice"" or as sophisticated as ""Pistol Whipped"", but still deserves its four stars. Distancing himself from Sony has paid off for Seagal, and fans ought to take notice ASAP.",1243987200,26,4898,6.239644970414201
