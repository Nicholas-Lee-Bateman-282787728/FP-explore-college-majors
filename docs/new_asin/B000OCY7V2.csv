2793857,5,B000OCY7V2,"This is the best of the best films they can release in one set for Lucille Ball. I just got the set yesterday, (June 27) and stayed up all night to watch all of the films.

The Big Street - This stars - Henry Fonda, Lucille Ball, Barton MacLane, Eugene Pallette, Agnes Moorehead, Sam Levine, Ray Collins, and Ozzie Nelson.

Critic's Choice - This stars - Bob Hope, Lucille Ball, Marilyn Maxwell, Rip Torn, Jessie Royce Landis, John Dehner, and Jim Backus.

Dance, Girl, Dance - This stars - Maureen O'Hara, Louis Hayward, Lucille Ball, Virginia Field, Ralph Bellamy, Mary Carlisle, Katherine Alexander, Edward Brophy, Walter Abel, Harold Huber, Maria Ouspenska, and Harry E. Edington.

DuBarry Was a Lady - This stars - Red Skelton, Lucille Ball, Gene Kelly, Virginia O'Brien, Zero Mostel, and Tommy Dorsey

Mame - This stars - Lucille Ball, Beatrice Arthur, Bruce Davison, Joyce Van Patten, Kirby Furlong, Robert Preston.

This is all of the stars of the 5 films. I was going to tell about the movies, but if you are purchasing this item, or are looking to see how the movies are according to other people on this site, I am not going to ruin your suprise. I will let you watch the films yourself, and all you are getting from me is - I LOVE THESE MOVIES.",1182988800,7,1256,4.584821428571429
2793858,5,B000OCY7V2,"This set is worth owning just for Mame, in which Lucille Ball BECOMES Auntie Mame.  DuBarry Was A Lady, Dance Girl Dance (with a young Maureen O'Hara) and The Big Street are all fan favorites.  While Lucy looks stunning in Critic's Choice, it is the least enjoyable film in the set (and the only ""stinker"" out of four films she made with her preferred screen-partner, Bob Hope).",1182297600,9,378,4.626865671641791
2793859,5,B000OCY7V2,"This is a GREAT collection to own and a must have for any Lucy fan! With this collection you will receive 5 movies starring Lucille Ball's most popular film adaption. You will be amazed to see the true acting ability of Lucy here.

Some of the films here are somewhat of a opposite to Lucille Ball's role on ""I Love Lucy"" but some are very similar to ""I Love Lucy"" in my opinion. Take ""The Big Street"" for instance, High class Gloria (Lucille Ball) was a bit cruel and mean to a poor man named pinks who falls head over heels in love with her and will do anything to please her at the end she begins to fall for him too. A must see dramatic film!!

You will see Lucille Ball like you have never seen her before and these movies are not boring at all but they are really good interesting movies that you will not lose interest in. I am somewhat shy of old films and find them boring but I can watch anything with Lucille Ball and you will love these films!

""Lucille Ball Film Collection"" includes:

""The Big Street"" - Ex-chanteuse Gloria is vain, cruel, crippled - and busboy Pinks can't help but love her. Ball and Henry Fonda power Damon Runyon's tale of Broadway denizens living on life's margins.

""Critic's Choice"" - That's no playwright, that's my wife. Poison-penned Broadway critic Bob Hope loves wife Lucille Ball...but hates the play she writes. Based on the play by ""Deathtrap's"" Ira Levin.

 Dance, Girl, Dance"" - Art doesn't pay the bills. So aspiring ballerina Ball makes her way as a burlesque star in this powerful study of being a woman in a man's world. With Maureen O'Hara.

""Dubarry Was A Lady"" - Their friendship is a perfect musical-comedy blendship! Ball goes from NYC torch singer to the dream girl of Red Skelton's wacky, 18th-century-France reverie. Gene Kelly joins the fun!

""Mame"" - She'll coax the blues right out of your heart. Madcap Auntie Mame (Ball) is suddenly her nephew's guardian. Robert Preston and Beatrice Arthur co-star in a sparkling adaptation of the Broadway hit.

Highly recommended!!!",1179014400,43,2032,4.6194444444444445

2793880,3,B000OCY7V2,"Lucille Ball actually made some great films, but these are not the best of them. This a middling representation of her film career as a whole. Her pre-Lucy career really had the hand of fate stirring the mix, as every great opportunity for a great film is smashed by creative powers at the studio. She is in the first Marx Brothers film to receive studio brass interference, creating the first Marx Brothers dud. DuBarry Was a Lady had the studio brass excising nearly all the Cole Porter score! The Big Street again found studio execs reshooting the ending, muddling and crippling the usual success of Damon Runyon stories on the screen. She also was cast in the least successful of the Hepburn-Tracey films.  Fate? Go figure. But fate took her to television and we are all the better! Missing here are her best starring roles in pre-""Lucy"" films, Annabel Takes a Tour, Fancy Pants, Sorrowful Jones, Miss Grant Takes Richmond, Fuller Brush Girl, Five Came Back, and Dark Corner. Still, this is a nice collection of ""almost hits"" from Lucille Ball's film career. Later gems like The Long Long Trailer, The Facts of Life, and Yours Mine and Ours, which are stand-along classics available for sale individually.",1479340800,,1209,4.840579710144928
2793881,5,B000OCY7V2,"Excellent showcase for Lucille Ball's talent as an actress.  5 films at a bargain price.  All the films looked fine.  My favorite is ""Dance, Girl, Dane"", where Lucille Ball (Bubbles) is wonderful as a ballet dancer who become a star burlesque performer...don't miss this one. Interesting to see Ball as ""Mame"",  but,in my view,  she's a bit long in the tooth for this role and the film doesn't delight me as does the Rosalind Russell version.",1476316800,3,442,4.7631578947368425

2793916,5,B000OCY7V2,"It was so enjoyable watching Lucille Ball in the years before, and after, she became the one and only Lucy.  It's a shame typecasting prevented her from being able to take on the wide range of roles she had before ""I Love Lucy,"" because the world seems to have forgotten what a brilliantly accomplished actress she really was.  Lucy handled dramatic and sentimental roles just as capably as the screwball comedy she became known for once television came along.",1335916800,2,460,4.810126582278481

2793918,5,B000OCY7V2,"First, let me start by saying ""The Big Street"" was Lucille Ball's finest dramatic performance on screen.  She should have been nominated for an Oscar.  Unfortunately, Lucy wasn't given the opportunity back in the late 30's and 40's to demonstrate her true acting ability.  ""Dance, Girl, Dance"" is another outstanding Lucy performance and directed by a female (way ahead of the times).  My favorite film in the package is ""Mame"" - Lucy is Mame and should have been nominated for an Oscar and should have won the Oscar for her portrayal.  ""Mame"" is my all time favorite movie musical.  ""Dubarry Was A Lady"" was an enjoyable musical and showcased Lucy's red hair.  ""Critic's Choice"" co-staring Bob Hope was an okay comedy with Lucy stealing most of the scenes from Bob.  Overall a very good collection of films.",1316649600,3,808,4.846715328467154
2793919,4,B000OCY7V2,"Lucille Ball had an unusual career; she toiled for a long time before becoming a second-string star at RKO in the late 1930s, then she went to MGM where she was featured in some of their bigger musicals, but she became a star of modestly-budgeted  features at a variety of studios (UA, 20th Century Fox, Columbia) from the mid-1940s, until she hit pay-dirt as a comedy star on television in the early 1950s. These five films show her at various stages of her evolution. DANCE GIRL DANCE and THE BIG STREET show her at her best as an actress in these two RKO features (reviewing her performance in THE BIG STREET, James Agee would note that she attacked her part in THE BIG STREET as if it were sirloin and she didn't care who's looking); DANCE GIRL DANCE has become a staple of feminist film studies because it is one of the films directed by Dorothy Arzner, who was the only woman director during the heyday of the studio system. DU BARRY WAS A LADY was a big, lavish MGM musical in which Ball stars (looking glorious in Technicolor) with Red Skelton and Gene Kelly; she's terrific. CRITIC'S CHOICE is a comedy made after Ball's ascendancy as a TV comedy icon; she's well-paired with Bob Hope here, and it is clever and charming. For those four films, this is a worthwhile collection.",1316304000,12,1285,4.538793103448276
2793920,5,B000OCY7V2,"The Lucille Ball Film Collection is a must have for every Lucy fan.  There are four great films and one not so great film in this collection.  ""The Big Street"" is Lucille Ball's finest dramatic performance.  She really shines in this film co-starring Henry Fonda.  I think her performance was Oscar worthy.  ""DuBarry Was A Lady"" is a pure musical-comedy delight co-starring Red Skelton and Gene Kelly.  Lucille Ball really looks outstanding with her red hair in this film.  ""Dance, Girl, Dance"" another rare gem that co-starred Maureen O'Hara.  Lucy really showed she could act in this film.  It's amazing how she was never given the opportunity that other actresses in the 40's were given.  My favorite movie of the bunch is ""Mame"", which is just a joyful, jubilant musical.  This film was unjustly crucified by most critics, but Lucille Ball showed she could pull this movie off.  People have rediscoverd this film and realize it's a very good old fashion movie musical.  Lucy was nominated for a Golden Globe for Mame and should have walked away with an Academy Award for this film.  She put 120% of herself in this film.  My least favorite film in the collection is ""Critic's Choice.""  It's not very funny, although, Lucy isn't bad in it and Lucy steals the film from Bob Hope as she did in all the films she co-starred with Bob Hope.",1281744000,7,1338,4.702586206896552
2793921,5,B000OCY7V2,"While I like all 5 movies featured in this box set, I bought this primarily because I wanted DANCE, GIRL, DANCE and THE BIG STREET as part of my home video library and the incredible price point made sense/cents.
This collection takes the viewer on a visual tour of Lucy's career from her pre-tv heyday thru the post I LOVE LUCY days when she returned to her musical roots in Mame. All the pictures were entertaining, but DGD and TBS offered the greatest departure from Lucy's wisecracking and funny girl friend/comedienne personna that her fans know and love. Lucy plays it for all it's worth as a nasty conniver in DGD trying to run into the ground the sweet and endearing good girl ballerina (played to perfection by Maureen O'Hara)and rope in THE MAN. In TBS, Lucy is a flat-out narcissistic diva kicking around a wannabe boyfriend/professional busboy (played by Henry Fonda) and earning the profound hatred of all those around her. Ironically, both films were from her RKO days and while they were not of the highest production standards, they gave Lucy the ability to break out in interesting ways.
These films will not disappoint die-hard Lucy fans or anyone who even kinda loves Lucy.",1268006400,2,1192,4.79126213592233

2793928,5,B000OCY7V2,"For any Lucille Ball fan or true film buff, this 5 dvd set is a must.  Of course, when Lucille was mixed with the character of Lucy an entity was created that will live on forever and never be replaced.

But this is Lucille Ball the actress and it is amazing to see her through all different phases of her career.  With DANCE, GIRL DANCE she was a very famous B actress who got cast with the A list and had no idea what her future held.

THE BIG STREET is a 100 % dramatic Lucille fully letting loose.  Beautiful, strong and just plain cruel - this role is a tour-de-force.  The gossips try to say that Henry Fonda hated working with her and criticized her acting style but then why would he return to her blessed company in YOURS, MINE AND OURS.

Some dis CRITIC'S CHOICE but I find it very entertaining to see her portray a regular middle aged woman.  I find the film very funny and her portayal very believable and so far removed from Lucy.

MAME - all I can say is her much critized singing voice brings a true presence to her portrayal.  She is lovely and has such fun.  The main production number is so lovely it will bring you to tears.  WE NEED A LITTLE CHRISTMAS is a true display of joy.  And I will forever say that I found the second half of this film to be some of her best dramatic acting ever.

These films are only in 1.0 sound but it still sounds great and the video transfers are crysal clear.

I think you can tell I love Lucy !!!!!!!!  Actually, who doesn't.  And whether you love all or some of these films she still brings her unique quality to each.  Purchase this set and enjoy !!!!!",1184284800,23,1607,4.17915309446254
2793929,5,B000OCY7V2,"This is a pretty good collection honoring Lucille Ball's motion picture work in various decades of her long career. She looks beautiful in ""Dubarry..."". The movie is dated but, she looks so glam. The film was made mostly just to promote MGM's Technicolor process of color filming. By the time ""Critic's Choice"" was made, Miss Ball was just past 50 years old. Heavy makeup and careful camera lensing makes her look about 15 years younger than she actually was. Ironically, the woman playing her mother in the film was about the same age as Lucy. ""Mame"" should have starred Angela Lansbury. But, Ball wanted to follow up her 1968 hit, ""Yours, Mine and Ours"" with a major film project. So, she secured rights to ""Mame"". Aside from her singing, the film is OK. She looks great thanks to her makeup team and Vaseline closeups. Nice campy moments. Glam clothes! ""Big Street"" is her best film of all that starred her.",1182988800,13,910,4.69375
