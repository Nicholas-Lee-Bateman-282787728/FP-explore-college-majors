531741,4,6302969301,"This film should be best seen not as a great of work of art but a light diverting upper class comedy of the sort set in Manhattan that  Hollywood delighted in churning out in the 1930s. Paulette Dubost steals the show as Lisette, the delectable and flirtatious maid of Christine, the stiff, cold and not even particularly attractive Austrian woman whose supposedly Goddess-like beauty provides the film's dramatic center. But the real action centers around Lissette's aggressive flirtation with Marceau, a sly and sleazy poacher of rabbits and woman, and the outraged and increasing deranged response to her affair by her gameskeeper husband. I particularly liked the treatment of Andre, the sort of immature and self-centered neurotic one often encounters in real life but seems seldom portrayed in contemporary film. Altogether it's a diverting, but a bit too drawn out 106 minutes.",1437177600,,884,5.225352112676056

531743,5,6302969301,"Great films inhabit a world all their own. It is almost impossible to grade them in any comparative sense with most other movies which are primarily entertainment. ""Rules of the Game"" is actually rather strange. But its strangeness is what gives it its unique brilliance. Is it a comedy of manners or a tragic indictment of the upper classes? It is all this and more. But most important, ""Rules of the Game"" is beautiful. Great sensitivity is found in every scenethe positioning of actors and  settings, the play of light, and the extraordinary camera work, all at the service of a director with tremendous artistic vision.",1431388800,,623,4.877358490566038

Sometimes all these rich people seem so superficial that we may suspect the actors of not taking their their role seriously. But that's what the film is about: these people had it so easy that they lacked consistency and were not taking life seriously enough.

What a waste of time, this is an incomplete film that invests no interest for an educated viewer. The French do not know how to entertain us, they are overtly too serious and pompous. In my opinion, the film is quite over-rated and Luis Bunuel does a better job at attacking the upper-classes and he makes us laugh as well. Grade: F",1388361600,2,441,4.261904761904762

It's a melodrama about people in love with each others' wives.  (Not a particularly biting social satire, despite the hype).  Its highlight by most accounts is a segment where the upper crusts are hunting rabbits, shooting them dead one after the other.  It's a flashy sequence, nicely framed. I enjoyed this movie, and appreciate its influence on other filmmakers - French ones, particularly - but I can't say that it's really a different animal from a lot of other late 1930's melodramas.",1378252800,,674,4.767241379310345

531818,4,6302969301,"My two previous exposures to this movie over the last 30 years were lukewarm. With the minuses balancing out the pluses, it impressed me as not much above average in the awesome canon of French Cinema. On this occasion, I experienced many more pluses, but it fell short of the flawless masterpiece status that has been claimed on its behalf by so many Amazon reviewers, and more significantly, by hundreds of scholars and film makers in scores of countries. Its faults have been turned into virtues, and any criticism castigated as blasphemy. One would think of it as a work of religion more so than art, so much adulation has it received from those who subscribe to the cult.
Let me first deal with the minuses. There is a great deal of plain silliness going on throughout the movie that lowers the tone of the whole piece. The most flagrant example is the extended scenes of Schumacher chasing Marceau with his loaded revolver through the party rooms while the guests unflappably continue their chatting, drinking, eating and seduction. Does this not remind you of many a Marx Bros. episode? Another is the punch-up between the Baron and Jurieu that would be more at home in Chaplin's CITY LIGHTS. Is it farce? Or social satire? Or simply fantasy, as the opening credits claim? The second minus is skepticism about the fundamental meaning of the movie --- indeed whether it has any meaning beyond artistic creation and presenting a picture of two segments of French society contemporary with its time of production. This is where the Emperor's clothes come in. Virtually all reviewers and critics see it as a prophetic harbinger of WWll. Why so? Why not WWl? After all, the celebrated shooting party is physicaly more reminiscent of events in the 1st than in the 2nd World War. Or why not just all wars in general, with military conflagration seen as the inevitable outcome of societal disintegration? Put another way, are they really inferring that if WWll had not broken out a year after it was made, Renoir's work would have remained consigned to the garbage dump of film history instead of being raised to its highest pantheon? Consider this: Renoir was not just one year ahead of his time, but fifty! The total breakdown in marital fidelity, sexual mores, and family values, both Upstairs and Downstairs,  and the demand for instant gratification that we see on the screen, all predict the current demise of Western society and the collapse of its economy that is the real war we are fighting today. I speculated how neatly Strauss-Kahn and his fellow swingers would have fitted into the shenanigans at the Chateau; and how vividly the shooting party portrays the defenceless investors as mortally wounded pheasants plunging to earth, following in the wake of their falling stocks! More fundamentally, is Renoir trying to prove that these wretches were responsible for the outcomes of the Society in which they lived, or merely its products? Not much from the pundits to help us on that one. Which makes much of the erudite comment on this film no more than critical blah, blah, blah! Of course, Renoir cannot be blamed for the nonsense of others, but he has to take responsibility for the abysmal miscasting of Nora Gregor in the key role of Christine, and for the leaden performance she comes up with once the die was cast.
On the plus side, this restored Criterion version is luminous, with a great deal more  magic than was apparent in the commercial screenings that I have previously seen. The editing, of Renoir or of Gaborit and Durand who were responsible for the restoration, keeps the pace going at a fair lick, no mean feat for a scenario where there is not much action other than in the heads of the various characters, until the final climax. Apart from Gregor, the other actors perform their roles with flair and distinction, which is to say they lie, cheat and lust with conviction. It is to Renoir's credit that, despicable as they are, he tries his best to present them in a more compassionate light than they perhaps deserve, by showing us that they, too, are God's creatures and have some redeeming humanity, if not quite enough for most tastes. Thus, the generosity shown by the Baron towards Marceau the poacher, and that of Octavien to almost everyone else ( even to the extent of robbing Peter to pay Paul), reveals Renoir's faith that some goodness can be found in even the most unlikely quarters.
In summary, I don't see the Emperor as naked, but neither do I see him clothed in the regal majesty that seems to have besotted most other viewers. Rather, as befits a former Communist, Renoir has dressed him (and by extension himself) as a workmanlike proletarian wearing his Sunday best.",1329696000,,4718,4.794840294840295

531860,3,6302969301,"""The Rules of the Game"" is a good film with nice cinematography and good performances, but I really believe one has to be French to truly understand and appreciate it.  The film is basically a spouse-swapping farce, something that would not have been able to be made in the U.S. after the Hays Code.  Most if not all the characters are after somebody else's spouse, and the spouses are always okay with it except for one of them, as I remember.  I suppose the title is ironical because none of the characters seems to be following any kind of conventional rule about propriety.

The low point of the film is undoubtedly the hunt.  I was disgusted with the shooting of rabbits for no apparent reason.  Shame on Renoir for even staging such a despicable thing.

In all honesty, American films of the period were far better at poking fun of their elites through the screwball comedies.  ""Rules"" does not measure up to the great comedies of 1930s Hollywood such as ""My Man Godfrey,"" ""It Happened One Night,"" ""Midnight,"" ""Bringing Up Baby,"" and others.  It's an okay film, but no masterpiece and certainly not a ""top ten greatest.""",1313712000,10,1126,4.675126903553299
531861,5,6302969301,"The best movie I've seen in a long time. There are different perceptions. Here is mine.
This is a movie about relationships, how they develop and how they break. Its about the joy and agony and above all the 'confusion' of love. Set up in an aristocratic French society, it portrays game hunting which is pretty symbolic. The game has no rules, people can kill as many rabbits or pheasants they wish but have to stop somewhere to make sure enough game is left so that the gamekeeper has a job. Similarly,in love, people can fall in love with as many people as they want but should stop somewhere so that love exists. Too much love can result in too many things going wrong which prevents love itself like in this case, aviator Andre......ok don't worry, I'll keep myself from narrating the movie.......its for you to find out..the rules of the game.",1293494400,,849,4.592105263157895

531863,5,6302969301,"It was 1939 and World War II and the Nazi Germans was coming.  What does director Jean Renoir (""The Grand Illusion"", ""The River"") do?  He creates a film titled ""La Regle du jeu"" (The Rules of the Game) that is part of an adaptation of Alfred de Musset's ""Les Caprices de Marianne"" and a film that was so far ahead of its time, it received an audience reaction that the filmmakers nor the crew/talent were expecting.

When the film was screened in front of audiences in Paris, the controversial film was boo'ed, led to fights in the theater and people burning their newspapers and leading theater owners to demand that Renoir cut the film. The 94-minute film that was screened in theaters, then became 81-minutes and unlike ""Grand Illusion"" which lasted three months in theaters, ""The Rules of the Game"" lasted only three weeks.  It was the worst reception that Renoir had ever had for a film and was considered a massive failure.  The upper class had an incredible disdain because of the actions of the characters in the film and because the film was a comedy that turns tragic, it was a film that defied normal standards of how storylines of films were at the time.

World War II came, Renoir fled to Rome (since he was a target by the Nazi's) and as for the film, it was banned by the French government.  When the film was sealed in a room with other films, because of World War II, that room was bombed and the original 94-minute cut of the film was destroyed.

And decades later, when two cinema fans Jean Gaborit and Jacques Durand wanted to fix the film back to its 94-minute glory, despite the original film being destroyed, the duo worked on the prints and compared with the 81-minute version.  And lo and behold, canisters of the unedited footage of the film were found and when the two were done, a 106 minute version was created and is the version of the film that the world has seen. With the French New Wave in full force in France, many film critics, filmmakers and cinema magazines have called ""The Rules of the Game"" as one of the best films created of all time.

It was a film that was ahead of its time when released in theaters that was jarring to the audience but for the young and upcoming filmmakers who had experienced the back in 1939, the film was nothing like they have ever seen in their lives and help shape French cinema during the 1950's and 1960's.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""The Rules of the Game"" is presented in black and white (1:33:1 aspect ratio).  For a 71-year-old film, The Criterion Collection did a very good job on the remastering.  Many times you can see the original footage (during the comparison footage) and you can see how much sharper and clearer the video is.  The picture quality is not perfect as you do see some film warping, dust and scratches at times but considering the negative source and how old this film is, this is a very good looking film on DVD.

According to Criterion, the new high-definition digital transfer was created on a Spirit Datacine from a 35mm fine-grain master positive.  Thousands of instances of dirt, debris and scratches were removed using the MTI Digital Restoration System.

As for the audio, audio is Monaural French and the dialogue is clear, the only thing that didn't sound too great is when they were playing a record off a player and sound seems a bit warped.  But for the most part, dialogue and musical soundtrack is clear.  I preferred to watch this film with audio on my receiver set to all channels for a more immersive soundscape.  According to the Criterion Collection, the soundtrack was mastered at 24-bit from a 35mm magnetic audio track and audio restoration tools were used to reduce clicks, pops, hiss and crackle.

Subtitles are in English.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""The Rules of the Game"" is considered a masterpiece and one of the greatest films of all time.  Ranked high by several film institutes and shown at film schools, the film was a bonafide flop during its theatrical run and only 20 years later, was the film truly appreciated and recognized.

The upper class and viewers of the film despised Renoir's film as many felt it was a middle finger to the upper class, nor were cinemagoers expecting a tragedy when they thought the film would be a comedy.  This is no different today especially how prestigious of a title this film has had since it's 106-minute theatrical re-release back in 1959.  Many viewers have approached the film almost similar to ""Citizen's Kane"" questioning why this film is so highly regarded.

For one, people must recognized what Renoir created.  During a time when many director's were politically affiliated with the left or the right, most films favored the Burgeois.  Renoir grew up with the rich courtesy of his famous father, painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir.  This film was Renoir wanting to show what he has experienced with the upperclass.  Men and women who had sexual liasons with other partners and things that are done without remorse.  Needless to say, the upperclass nor was the French government enthusiastic about the film.  They outright banned it.

Renoir created a film that featured beautiful cinematography, well-paced but it took the viewer from its comedic ties to an ending that shocked viewers to the point they were disgusted, boo'ed and threw items on the front of the screen because they were upset.  How could a film that could have been happy and a have a happy ending not be happy?  With World War II approaching and Nazi Germany, the French viewers had no tolerance for such a film during that time and unfortunately, because of its failure, Renoir moved to Rome and then to the United States knowing he would be targeted or used by the Nazi's.

Bare in mind, this was before the French New Wave.  Before Godard, Chris Marker, Agnes Varda, Francois Truffaut, Eric Rohmer and others who would make their mark for their accomplishments for their works in cinema and doing their own thing.  Going against what was normal in cinema and against what people typically expected.  It was an exciting time in the 1960's and these director's praised the work of Jean Renoir and Jean Vigo.  For Alain Resnais and even Francois Truffaut, ""The Rules of the Game"" was significant as it showed them before their own careers of what cinema is capable of.  In 1939, Jean Reno paid the price and although hailed for being one of the best masterpieces of all time, as much as Reno was happy, he paid the price.  First, being forced to cut the film down to 81-minutes and then that version not surviving in the theater for a month and of course, losing the original cut of the film during World War II.  It seemed too much but eventually he would rebound over a decade later when he worked on his first color film ""The River"".

""The Rules of the Game"" is a film that challenged social convention. In terms of cinematography, it was unique as lighting was timed, characters in the background walking and reacting are timed perfectly with the main talent seen on camera.  Was this camera work inspirational to Orson Welles for ""Citizen Kane"".  Possibly.  But technically, the film looked so free flowing and cuts were well-done.  Call it avante-garde or call the film the inspiration for the French New Wave, this 106-minute version of the film is a version that people around that many French didn't see.  A version that we get to see digitally remastered and restored and of course, with The Criterion Collection treatment, we get a lot of special features bundled with this release.  It's a fantastic release and its one of those films that may require several viewings but also helps to learn the backstory of the film and why it is so important in the history of cinema.

I'm not going suggest you to watch or own this film because critics call it one of the greatest films of all time.  But I do hope people watch this film, know its impact as a failed masterpiece in 1939, but then 20-years-later, becoming a golden masterpiece that was way ahead of its time and it took that long to be appreciated. It's quite interesting because Renoir and Orson Welles became good friends in Hollywood.  Renoir told Welles that ""an artist must be 20 years head of his time but it was harder for an artist of the cinema because the cinema insists upon being 20 years behind the public"".  Like father, like son.  Jean Renoir's ""La Regle du jeu"" (The Rules of the Game) is a masterpiece and over 70-years later, is still on top of the list for many cinema polls as one of the greatest films of all time.

But this edition is especially provocative. It is particularly interesting that the movies that are considered breakthroughs often did the worst at the box office. Renoir was nearly driven out of France for this one. The comparisons with Citizen Kane are fascinating.

531890,3,6302969301,"French filmmaker Jean Renoir's 1939 black and white classic, The Rules Of The Game (La Rgle Du Jeu), routinely shows up on Top Five lists for best films ever, along with classics like Orson Welles' Citizen Kane, Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, and Yasujiro Ozu's Tokyo Story. But, it's not in a league with any of that tercet. In fact, while it's a good film, and a quite enjoyable one, it's not even close to being a great film. There are two basic reasons why: first is that, despite some kudos given by technical experts, the film is not nearly as visually compelling nor stunning as the Welles film, and its oft-claimed camera innovations and cinematography are not anything that wows a viewer. Of course, there are some interesting moments, and some of the nature photography is first rate, but anyone expecting to see the 1930s equivalent of The Matrix or 2001: A Space Odyssey, will be disappointed. This is, of course, not so much the fault of the film itself as it is the critics and champions who gush over every scene in the film. The second, and more important, reason this film fails to touch greatness is the manifest- its screenplay by Renoir and Carl Koch. While a slight twist, and improvement, on the screwball comedies of the day- by mixing it with the comedy of manners format (adapted from a 19th Century stage entry in that genre: Alfred de Musset's Les Caprices De Marianne, the film fails to develop a single compelling, sympathetic, or even remotely interesting character. In fact, the film fails to develop characters, period. They are all caricatures, which is not bad, in itself, if the film is solely intended as a satire. After all, is there a single realistic character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb? Unfortunately, The Rules Of The Games clearly tries and succeeds at being more than mere satire, and that little success is why the film's overall arch to greatness fails.
While The Rules Of The Game is certainly a film landmark, it is clearly not a great film. Its time has long since passed, on many levels, the least of which is its provincial ideas (note the casual bigotry in the `toy Negress' Robert plays with and the anti-Semitic caricatures the bourgeoisie portray in one of their musical numbers). In a sense, its overrating mirrors that of the novel The Great Gatsby, by F. Scott Fitzgerald, which, despite its flaws, has tireless champions who likewise, identify with the characters to such a degree that they are inoculated to any technical flaws within, much less the fact that they are that book's targets. To the rest of the audience, however, is left a solid comedy that tries a little too hard to be deep, instead of what it is- entertainment. Thus I repeat, and lament, where is the French Groucho when you need him?",1221955200,5,2827,4.724696356275303

They are similar because in both movies there is deception and this person is hooking up with this one and so on but there is no real love.

The movie also takes some shots at the media as one character points out how all these important people on television lie why shouldn't the simple people.  The movie says a lot and could generate a different perspective to each viewer which makes it great by transcending being pigeonholed into a genre.  Simply giving a plot description would be cheating it.  All this funny business takes place at a weekend hunting party where the only thing separating the guests from the game they're hunting are the rules.

531892,4,6302969301,"The Rules of the Game (Jean Renoir, 1939)

As I'm only approaching forty, I find it quite difficult to look at this film from the historical perspective with which most critics frame it; after all, I wouldn't be born for almost thirty years after the film's initial release. But, unlike a number of movies for which historical context seems important, I can't say, after reading a number of reviews and articles about it, that missing all that context seems to have damaged my perception of the film; as I see it, the movie stands on its own, historical context or no. Why? Because it's blamed funny, that's why.

Renoir's satirical look at class warfare in pre-WW2 France holds up because, well, there will always be class warfare, and the haves will always see themselves as superior to the have-nots, and from that standpoint, it's universal. In this case, the haves are going to a weekend hunting party at the country estate of Cheyniest (Marcel Dalio), and bringing most of the have-nots, their servants. The catalyst to everything that follows is Cheyniest's impulsive hiring of Marceau (Julien Carette), a local who is caught poaching rabbits on Cheyniest's land. He refuses to play by the unwritten rules of the haves and the have-nots, and anarchy ensues.

Renoir, of course, had a flair for the absurd a mile wide, and even in his most subtle moments, he's painting with it. (""It breaks my heart, but I cannot expose the guests to your firearms."") And this is where The Rules of the Game, in my estimation, differs from its far more recent heir, Robert Altman's Gosford Park-- that film takes itself far too seriously on every level, where Renoir always leavens his deeper, angrier meanings with laughter. Where Altman sprawls, Renoir focuses in with laser precision, turning away from nothing, examining every detail of every scene. (The unveiling of the clockwork calliope, it is revealed in the DVD extras, took two days of shooting because Renoir wanted to get Dalio's expression perfect; Renoir says it was the best scene he ever shot.)

A fine, fine piece of work, whether you recognize the historical significance or not. ****",1212105600,5,2143,4.895316804407713
531893,5,6302969301,"Director Renoir's scathing critique of French social conventions and hypocrisy caused quite a stir on release, and it's not hard to see why. A bit too clever and close to home for its time, the film's sublime satire has a cutting edge, as both masters and servants fixate on trivialities and behave foolishly, while all around them, Rome burns- or is it Paris? (Only a year after the film's release, the Nazis would occupy France). This is one game still worth playing.",1182384000,,469,4.7317073170731705
531894,5,6302969301,"The folks at ""Criterion Collection"" sure do go out of their way to tout their products -- such as this release of Renoir's immortal ""Rules of the Game"" -- as being the alpha and omega of DVD releases.

This two-disc set sure has a lot of extras bundled in, but I'm disappointed in one major category:  although you can get the English subtitles off the screen, you cannot have it display French subtitles, in case you're passable at French or would like to clarify or improve something.

There is quite the literate commentary track in English, however, although the movie has not been dubbed into English on any audio track.

French films like this one and countless others have not only been praised by some of the best directors in the world - from Scorcese to Kurosawa, - but hugely influential as well. Broadway-adapted French classics such as ""The Fanthom Of The Opera"", ""Beauty And The Beast"", ""Les Miserables"" and ""Notre Dame De Paris"" have entertained millions (and made many wealthy) to this day. So who says the French - who by the way invented Cinema - are boring?",1177113600,,717,4.790322580645161
531896,5,6302969301,"Regarded by many as one of the greatest movies ever made, Jean Renoir's ""The Rules of the Game"" had a poor reception in Paris in 1939. Audiences were enraged. French conservatives were offended. This social satire about the games of love as played by upper class acquaintances and their domestic servants who assemble at the country home of the Marquis de la Chesnaye for a weekend of hunting nearly moved people to riot. Watching ""The Rules of the Game"" now, it's impossible to see it as audiences did then. The characters are charming relics of an extinct society. And the film we see isn't what audiences saw in 1939. The original edit was 94 minutes long, then cut to 81 minutes in a futile attempt to appease the public. The film was reconstructed in 1959 from all available footage, resulting in the extended 106-minute version that we see today. Earlier versions were harsher, allowing for less character development and emotional depth. Quite simply, the wrong film was shown to the wrong audience in 1939. ""The Rules of the Game"" opened on the Champs-Elysees, where bourgeois audiences saw their values mocked on the big screen.

Inspired by 18th century comedies and Musset's ""Les Caprices de Marianne"", Jean Renoir went one better with the stock characters of husband, wife, mistress, lover, and interceding friend. He doubled them, creating matched opposing pairs in the upstairs/downstairs social circles. The Marquis Robert de la Chesnaye (Marcel Dalio) invites an assemblage of friends to his country home for a hunt and a party in honor of a new national hero, the aviator Andre Jurieu (Roland Toutain). Robert plans to dismiss his mistress Genevieve (Mila Parely) and pursue a more sincere relationship with his somewhat nave Austrian wife Christine (Nora Gregor). But Christine is pursued by the handsome young Jurieu. Old family friend Octav (Jean Renoir) negotiates a fine line as friend and accomplice to all. Christine's maid Lisette (Paulette Dubost) watches with interest as she evades her earnest gamekeeper husband (Gaston Modot) in favor of a flirtatious poacher (Julien Carette).

Considering Jean Renoir's communist sympathies in the 1930s, it is easy to see ""The Rules of the Game"" as a critique of bourgeois materialism and propriety. But the film is not so limited. It's a broader commentary on the consequences of etiquette that every society imposes on its members by necessity. The consequences of not understanding the rules and of understanding them all too well. Whatever he may be criticizing, Jean Renoir's sympathies are clearly with his characters. These hauts bourgeois, with their alternating spectacles of slaughter, farce, and delicacy, are ultimately likable and sensitive. Renoir scholar Alexander Sesonske called ""The Rules of the Game"" ""the most complex social criticism ever enacted on the screen."" Perhaps it is simply the most sympathetic. And to that the film owes its enduring success. French with optional English subtitles.

The DVDs (Criterion Collection 2004):  Disc 1 contains the film, a ""Renoir Introduction"" (6 1/2 min) in which the director talks about the film's reception and why it was considered controversial, an audio commentary, comparison of different edits, and some additional scene analysis. The white English subtitles are sometimes difficult to read and would have been better in yellow. The audio commentary is a good scene-by-scene analysis of the film written by Renoir scholar Alexander Sesonske and read by Peter Bogdanovich. It discusses the political atmosphere in the time between Munich and the War, themes, social context, characters, structure, social juxtapositions, class distinctions, etc. ""Version Comparison"" includes the film's final scenes as they appeared in the 81-minute edit of the film, which change the meaning of the final act. Professor of Film at Carleton University in Ottawa Chris Faulkner compares (13 min) the final scenes in the 106-minute version with the same scenes in the 81-minute version, which omitted many of Octav's scenes. ""Scene Analysis"" is by Renoir historian Chris Faulkner: ""Public and Private"" (5 1/2 min) analyzes the opening scenes and the final scene. ""Corridor"" (3 min) discusses depth of field in one scene.

Disc 2 includes television shows about Jean Renoir, the film's production history, and interviews. ""Jean Renoir, Le Patron"" (31 min) is from the French TV series ""Cineastes de Notre Temps"". In this 1967 interview, Renoir discusses the script, characters, and deep focus. Includes a conversation between Renoir and Marcel Dalio in which they talk about creating the character of the Marquis. In French with English subtitles, but the quality of the print is poor and burned out. ""BBC Documentary"" (1 hour) is the first part of a 2-part 1993 documentary which follows Renoir's life ""From La Belle Epoche to World War II"". Includes interviews with Jean Renoir, his son, and those who knew him. Talks about his childhood and youth as the son of painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir, his career in filmmaking, influence during the 1930s, until his departure to Hollywood in 1940. ""Production History"" includes a video essay (8 min) narrated by Chris Faulkner that traces the film from its conception until its reconstruction in 1959, as well as an archived interview with Jean Gaborit and Jacques Durand, who did the 1959 reconstruction. ""Interviews"" are with people who took part in the film: Production designer Max Douy (9 min), 2003, French with subtitles. Actress Mila Parely (16 min), 1995, French with subtitles. And assistant cameraman Alain Renoir (19 min), 2003, in English. ""Tributes"" (text) are 13 brief essays by writers, directors, and critics paying tribute to ""The Rules of the Game"".",1169596800,6,5727,5.247816593886463
531897,5,6302969301,"I didn't know what to expect given the vaunted reputation of Jean Renoir's acknowledged 1939 masterpiece, but what surprises me most is its frenetic energy, really akin to a Marx Brothers farce in depicting the goings-on of the French bourgeoisie during the tenuous period just before WWII. The 2004 Criterion Collection DVD contains a masterfully restored print of this social dramedy focusing on a diverse group of characters on a palatial country estate during a weekend hunt.

The event is spurred by Andr Jurieu, an adventurous aviator who just crossed the Atlantic to a hero's welcome only to find his lover Christine has not greeted him. Petulant about his rejection, he is invited by his best friend, the boorish, seemingly happy-go-lucky Octave, to the hunt since it is at La Colinere, the chateau of Christine and her husband, the wealthy Marquis Robert de la Chesnaye. Also invited is Robert's mistress Genevieve, and romantic complications inevitably ensue. All the while, the servants carry on with their own shenanigans as Christine's soubrette maid Lisette, married to the Germanic estate gamekeeper Schumacher, dallies with Marceau, a new domestic hired by Robert after getting caught poaching rabbits on the grounds.

Even though it looks like it will be a serious character study from the outset, there are actually quite a few moments that border on slapstick. But there is an increasing gravitas to the proceedings sparked by the actual game hunt where we see rabbits and pheasants slaughtered mercilessly by the guests. Renoir obviously wants to show us the unconcerned attitudes of the rich encapsulated in one defining scene, and it works. From that point, the various deceptions start to unravel until Andr makes a serious-minded proposition to Christine that amounts to breaking the rules of their elitist existence. It isn't too surprising that tragedy subsequently occurs as such violations are intolerable among the upper crust.

The cinematography by Jean-Paul Alphen, Jean Bachelet, Jacques Lemare and Alain Renoir is most impressive as it alternates fluidly between realistic documentary-style shots with dramatic deep-focus tableaux in the house that capture the fulsome activity. The acting is first-rate with stand-out work from Roland Toutain as Andr, Marcel Dalio as Robert, a comical Julien Carette as Marceau and Renoir himself as Octave. Although I don't think it's completely necessary, some knowledge of European history during this period is helpful in understanding some of the film's nuances such as making Christine an Austrian or having one of the servants mouth such anti-Semitic remarks as everyday conversation.

Criterion's two-disc set is chockfull of extras beginning with Renoir's own introduction of the film taped in 1966. There is audio commentary narrated by Peter Bogdanovich from notes supplied by film scholar Alexander Sesonske, and scene-specific commentary from Renoir specialist Christopher Faulkner. There are three extended video excerpts included on the second disc - the first from 1966 with Renoir's participation, the second from an extensive 1993 BBC documentary, and the third a video essay on not only the original production but the reconstruction that took place when original footage became lost during the war. This all seems luxuriant, but this classic film does live up to its reputation.",1158019200,4,3367,5.395437262357414
531898,4,6302969301," La rgle du jeu  is compact and tight, like a gymnast's body, and beautifully respects the rules of classical unity : time, place and action, here a maze of plots and subplots which intercut between the worlds of masters and servants and build an intricate pattern of mirror effects.

Film succeeds only too well as it fulfils its  programme  to expose the shallowness of French upper classes.

In  La rgle du jeu , Renoir's  bourgeoisie  (the party's host, Dalio's marquis de La Chesnaye, is Jewish by his mother) wines, dines and cheats with less style, panache, and of course, nobleness, than his aristocrats die in  La grande illusion  : de La Chesnaye is no de Boldieu or von Rauffenstein.

531950,5,6302969301,"`The Rules of the Game', written and directed by Jean Renoir is considered by most to be one of the top ten movies of all time, commonly spoken of in the same class as Fellini's `La Dolce Vita', Kurasawa's `The Seven Samurai', Wells `Citizen Kane', Eisenstein's `Battleship Potemkin' and Kubrick's `2001' I completely agree with this assessment, but with a comments on why this movie is so much different than these others.

There are many things you can appreciate about this movie with nothing more than the English translation of the dialogue. I confess that I had to be prompted to appreciate this, but a careful viewer should be able to see how skillful Renoir and his cameramen are in making long focus shots where both foreground and background action can be seen in clear focus. The camera work may not be quite as dramatic as Eisenstein or Wells, but it is effective nonetheless. And, like these other directors, the camera shots are not done just to be clever. They are always used to capture something important, as when we see action down a hall in the middle background that puts the lie to the dialogue in the foreground.

Another cinematic trick is how Renoir ties together several scenes by some perfectly logical devices. The most dramatic is in the first few scenes where many of the principle characters are introduced at widely separate locations by the device of having all the characters either contributing to or listening to the same radio broadcast upon the arrival of aviator, Andre Jurieu at a Paris airport upon repeating the transatlantic flight of Charles Lindbergh.

While the cinematic devices and stage directions contribute much, the meat of the film is in the relations between the eight principal characters, forming three interlocking romantic triangles among the bourgeoisie and a parallel triangle in the servant class, linked by the `classless' character, Octave (played by Renoir himself). These various interlocking romances drive most of the action throughout the movie, and are, collectively, evidence of a rottenness in the fabric of French society. Part of the greatness of this movie is that the malady Renoir depicts probably cannot be summarized in a few words, which is why we need a two hour movie to fully play it out.

Unfortunately for the modern American viewer who does not know French and whose knowledge of French 20th century history may be a bit weak, there is much in this movie which will be missed. The first is as simple as some word usages common to European languages but foreign to modern English. French and German both have two different modes of addressing people. One is polite and respectful for business colleagues, superiors, distant relatives, and just about everything except close relatives such as spouse, children, and close friends. The use of one form of address or the other is a dead giveaway to some aspects of the relation between people in drama. The second is present in English, but probably not very familiar to the average speaker. This is the difference between `good-bye' and `farewell'. The first simply means you are leaving for the moment, and expect to see the listener again soon. The latter means you are parting company for good, as when you are breaking a relationship and leaving for a distant land. I experienced how dramatic this difference was when I was leaving a company in Germany after a summer employment and used the German form of `farewell' and found my listeners were really touched by the distinction.

An even more important background element is the fact that this movie was filmed just a few months before the outbreak of World War II, and everyone knew it was coming. Thus, anything said to reflect on the soundness of the French culture or `backbone' could be taken as a serious criticism of the French state. Another subtlety is the fact that the lead actress, Nora Gregor, is from Strasbourg, a German city that just happens to be in France as a result of World War I.

The film is subtitled a `dramatic fantasy' which takes some of the bite out of the social satire, but not much. On a visceral level, I can't find a single major character with whom I am sympathetic. They are all tangled up in what seem like such shallow relationships, where the principle male character's interest in mechanical toys seems more important to him than his relation with his wife.

This DVD includes the single most useful extra, an English commentary track written by film scholar, Alexander Sesonske and read by the noted director and film commentator, Peter Bogdanovich. This commentary illuminates almost all of the things that may be hidden by the language and the historical context.

Most of the other extras support our understanding of the film, our appreciation of how it went from commercial flop in 1939 to its appreciation as a great film today, and our appreciation of what Renoir had to do to get the film made.

While I do not know if older versions of the film are available, it is worth warning that this particular 106 minute version of the film is actually 12 minutes longer than Renoir's original release and almost 20 minutes longer than the version cut down after the original critical and commercial failure of the 92 minute version. While I cannot be absolutely sure the long version is better than the original, the film is so important that every scrap of information we have about the film is valuable.

One contribution of some extras is testimonials by major directors such as Francois Truffaut and Bernardo Bertolluci on how this film influenced their careers. If I were to find anything at all objectionable about this package it is the fact that the booklet is printed with white text on a dark gray and is very difficult to read.

531954,5,6302969301,"Jean Renoir's masterpiece about the decay of the French bourgoisie. The heart of the movie takes place at a country chateau; first the guests shoot down rabbits and pheasants and then later at a party the guests are shot at themselves. Behind it all are the various love affairs going on between members of this party: although love is declared between some and passions even run wild, all is kept in check by the stultifying ""rules of society"" that say, for instance, that a man can't run away with another man's wife unless he first talks to the offended husband, or that even after a killing has taken place one must keep up appearances and declare it ""an accident."" The scene at the party where the gameskeeper is running through the chateau chasing the servant who has made advances toward his wife, shooting at him, while two other men are having a fist fight for the love of Christine - and the guests are oblivious to what's going on because they think it's all part of a masquerade, is a highlight in film history. Many rate this among the greatest movies ever made.

The title, plot, abstract terms, cinematic features, director, theme, actors, set design, mood and final scene all play a role in the final product.

""The Rules of the Game"" is a story about the rules of love.  Of course there are very few set rules, which is the basis for this movie.  For example: Jurieu is in love with Christine, but she is already married to Robert; Robert loves Christine, but he is having an affair with Marras; and Marceau is in love with Madam Schumacher, but she is already married.  This carnival of love triangles continues to grow, and changes shape throughout the movie.  In the end, all the relationships are destroyed, which is due to the way those in the society interact with each other.

The characters are used to represent the uncaring pleasure that seems to saturate the movie.  Robert's music boxes, as abstract terms, show how the characters can be fickle.  Just like the music box would play for whoever wants to listen, the characters would love whoever caught their interest at the time.  And, the camera seemed to follow the same method.

All the cinematic features were used to pull the audience into the film.  The camera seems to flow around the characters as if it was one of them.  And, as the movie progresses, different characters gain its attention.  Renoir uses the depth of field in order to make the flow of characters, into the audiences view, seem more realistic and less conspicuous.  The depth of field is also used to balance out the scene.  For example, in the scene where Christine is explaining her relationship with Jurieu to the guests, Octave and Robert are right behind her lightening the mood.  Also, the sound was very realistic.  When there is music in the background, the audience knows where it is coming from.  There is no invisible band playing a score.

The musical device is always shown.  For example, the masquerade music plays during a large portion of the chase and fight scenes.  These techniques add a sense of realism to the movie.

""The Rules of the Game"" has a great director, Jean Renoir.  He is able to bring the movie to life.  Without his insight and talent, the film would not be as good as it is.  Renoir considered French society, ""...rotten to the core.""  He hoped people would realize it, and change their ways.  Renoir wanted the movie to be viewed as a real portrayal of the French society.  The only difference is, in his society no one wore any masks.  Also, he once stated that he did not follow the shooting script because his characters where always changing.  Renoir liked to be absorbed by the show, and let it dictate what should happen.  He did not create any main character, yet he uses society as a substitute.  Each person's life is a different thread, continually interwoven throughout the scenes.

The actors themselves do not seem to be, in any way, special.  It is the way in which the film is made, and what it is designed for that makes the film a success.  Renoir could have chosen just about anyone to play the characters.  For example, the man who plays Robert was surprised that he was picked for the part.  In the past, he had only played villains and monsters.  For ""The Rules of the Game,"" he became the imaginary owner of ""La Coliniere.""

""La Coliniere"" was not a set.  It was a true home, and the estate grounds were also real.  I am surprised to discover this fact.  Most houses are too small for shooting, but this one gave Renoir enough room to film with style, and to give his film a mood of its own.

The mood of the film is summarized in the last scene.  Some characters, even though their issues are not resolved, stay at ""La Coliniere.""  This leaves the characters' lives open for more issues to come.  Reasonably similar to true life, there is no true harmony until a person is deceased.  Jurieu is the only one, which we know of, who will receive that peace.

I liked the film, because it created a feeling of true real life action.  When the audience was viewing a single scene, the rest of the action did not stop.  In some movies, it seems as if the rest of the imaginary world stops, while you view a particular character.

I believe, out of all the aspects that make a great movie, the director and his vision (which include the camera techniques that Renoir used) are what made this movie work.  The rest were little bonuses, which helped, but were not the cause of its success.  A movie can be told very differently from one director to another.  It is their vision that makes all the difference.  When the movie was first shown, Renoir was so controversial that someone tried to set fire to the theater.  If a person can create emotion like that from their film, it is bound to become great at some time in the future.",1112745600,7,4957,4.535593220338983
531956,5,6302969301,"No history of cinema would be complete without ""The Rules of the Game"" (1939). Director Jean Renoir's brilliant, perceptive study of a dying French aristocracy remains among the finest examples of visual poetry captured on film - as evidenced in the savage ""rabbit hunt"" and the haunting final shot. Along with ""Grand Illusion"" (1937), ""The Rules of the Game"" represents the high-water mark of Renoir's career. It's as close to perfection as a film can get.",1106179200,24,457,5.026315789473684
531957,5,6302969301,"To all the reviewers below who express disappointment that this film wasn't as ""great"" as they thought it was going to be, I have one suggestion: Watch it again.  And again.  And again.  A work of art this profound does not reveal itself in one hasty viewing.  To the reviewer who said that they have never heard anyone explain exactly why the RULES OF THE GAME is such a great film, I am going to do just that, or at least try to in the limited confines I have here.  Unlike just about any other fiction film ever produced, Renoir's 1939 masterpiece, I think, captures and preserves on celluloid the rhythmic whirlpool of life as it is actually lived by real humans.  The conventions of the Hollywood narrative - organized around ""stars,"" a complex-yet-hidden editing style that tells us what to look at and how to feel as we watch, and a story which itself is supposed to provide a clear moral or lesson - just cannot be found here.  This fundamental difference between RULES and the kind of film most of us are used to seeing may explain the angry, even bewildered disappointment expressed by some reviewers - ""Is THAT all there is?""  RULES is perhaps the only film that allows the spectator to choose, and more importantly, to think for themselves about what they are seeing as they see it.  I myself had heard of RULES long before I actually saw it a few years ago, and I remember leaving my first screening feeling distinctly let down.  Oh, sure, I was very impressed, even awed by individual sequences (like the famous hunting scene and the great danse macabre), and as a document of French life in the last year of peace, it seemed to me well worth seeing, but what WAS all the fuss about?  And then a very strange thing started to happen to me - going about my day to day existence, random scenes from the film began to appear in my mind and I found myself thinking about the characters in RULES quite a bit.  At parties, I started to stand back and watch the people interact in an unconscious but beautifully choreographed dance, just like the characters in RULES do.  I began paying more attention to the rigid expectations of manners and etiquette, and the subtle (and not-so-subtle) ways in which people accept and reject those rules.  I even began to perceive that the one great rule which most of us adhere to is the RULE for which Andre Jurieu dies - never demonstrate true passion in public.  The marvelous release of RULES on this magnificent DVD gives us all the chance to appreciate and enjoy Renoir's marvelous achievement.  With each sucessive viewing, I am more and more in awe of what Renoir and his cast accomplish in this remarkable work - RULES is not a typical cinematic ""imitation"" or stylization of human life, it IS human life itself.  This is the only fiction film ever made that seems like a documentary.  The plot itself is quite simple:  In the fall of 1938, famous aviator Andre Jurieu completes a solo flight across the Atlantic.  Although the country goes wild over him, he pays no attention to his own celebrity, because he did it all for love - the love of a married woman, Christine, Marquise de la Chesnaye.  Exposing his innermost reasons for his heroic act in a radio interview, he castigates Christine for failing to welcome him personally after his flight.  In her boudoir, Christine shuts off the radio and prepares for a night out on the town with her husband, Robert.  Although she does not know it, Robert is still seeing his old flame, the aristocratic Genevieve.  Robert's infidelity is a secret, but Andre's public declaration of passion for Christine threatens to shame them all.  Andre, driving himself insane over Christine, begs his best friend, Octave (played with Falstaffian panache and humour by Renoir himself) to intercede on his behalf.  Octave, who loves Christine as a sister, persuades her and Robert to invite Andre along on a hunting party at La Colinere, the Chesnaye's country house.  At La Colinere, matters reach a head one fateful night after a masked ball.  Christine - who tells Andre that she loves him, yet in the end agrees to run away with Octave - ultimately remains with her husband after Andre is accidentally shot to death by Robert's gamekeeper.  There is no way that a simple plot summary can indicate much about this film, but it is a start.  One reviewer mentions that none of the characters are sympathetic.  Perhaps.  Yet none of the characters are unsympathetic, either.  In this film, I feel like I am watching real people in all their messy complexity, not characters created to prove a point.  Each of the characters - like each of us - has their good and bad sides, and Renoir allows all of his people to display their personalities in dizzying complexity.  Andre - whose passion for Christine seems both selfish and excessive at times - loves with a force that will cost him his life.  Robert is a kind, cultured, but weak man who tries to please everyone all the time and ultimately pleases no one.  Christine - treated like a toy or a symbol by all the men - just wants to be loved for herself and longs for true friendship, even to the point of befriending her husband's mistress...Indeed, Christine's closest relationship is with her maid, Lisette, and not with a man at all.  Even the glamorous, brittle and annoying Genevieve is revealed as suffering from her unrequited love for Robert - and is there anything more heartbreaking than being unable to stop loving someone who no longer loves you but who once did?  And that is just the major characters!  I should say that no one character or actor dominates this film - Renoir seems to give everyone equal screen time, allowing everyone to explain their ""reasons"" through their actions.  The technique of this film is frankly astonishing.  Renoir uses ""deep focus"" to stage one complex sequence after another, interweaving plot and character so skillfully that each scene seems packed with incident and implication, so much so that only repeated viewings make clear that there is not a single moment in this film which does not bear fruit in later events.  And yet, how free and easy it all seems!  No fiction film is more natural than this one - somehow, the actors don't seem like actors at all, but ordinary people making decisions right in front of your eyes, the consequences of which are then played out in the next exchange.  The dialogue is witty and humorous - the film is also very, very funny.  Many may be put off by the odd shifts in tone that characterize RULES - as in the famous hunting scene, which grows more unbearable to watch  with each passing second and leaves the viewer drained, exhausted.  We go to a film expecting something clear - a comedy, a drama, a documentary, a fiction - but this film swings wildly between comedy and tragedy, often within the same scene - just like life itself.  Our reactions are never spoonfed and we are never told what to think or how to feel by any silly music - the only music in the film occurs when the characters play music, which is a relief after a million manipulative Hollywood scores.  Other reviewers have mentioned the film's social context, so I won't go into that here.  Let me conclude by saying that the RULES OF THE GAME is one of those rare art masterpieces that makes you feel life's beauty, brevity and horror all at the same time.  It explores the meaning of fundamental emotions and strips away the lies we tell ourselves so we can function in society.  Ultimately, RULES is a tragic film, because it shows that the basic human impulse is to love, yet this impulse is forever blocked, frustrated and destroyed by the lies we tell ourselves, the strictures we place on ourselves, and by our own inaccurate perceptions.  I have no words of praise high enough for Renoir's achievement.  The Criterion DVD is itself a joy - the negative of RULES was destroyed in WW II and this goregous transfer is the best we are ever likely to have.  RULES is also a physically beautiful film, exquisitely lit and shot, stunningly composed, and if you have only seen this film in grainy, decayed prints, be prepared for an aesthetic revelation!  This is one of those rare works of art that forces you to measure yourself against it.  What conclusions will you make about your own enslavement to the ""rules?""",1105574400,9,8320,4.64412568306011
531998,2,6302969301,"There are plenty of pretentious review on this site declaring this ""One of the greatest films of all time."" To offer a different perspective, I will tell you right now, unless you live for deep social meaning and long takes, seek elsewhere. The film has its moments of beauty and exquisite cinematic technique. In particular, the hunting scene which shows creature after creature being carelessly shot and suffering the quick throes of death is powerful and difficult to watch. However, I don't agree with the ""greatest"" label. The plot was diluted and almost nonexistent. The characters seemed so flighty that they lacked depth. In fact, very few of them were even likable. The ending seems unresolved and somewhat careless, based on a series of ridiculous coincidences. Overall, I was unimpressed and surprised at the acclaim showered on this film. Social commentary is great in it's own right, but I have yet to have any critic present a convincing argument as to why this film is so great.",1105574400,28,993,4.952095808383233
531999,5,6302969301,"With the world-spread acclaim as Renoir's classic and one of the greatest film ever made, we tend to forget that it was only 20 years after its making that RULES OF THE GAME was acknowledged as a masterpiece, when the 'restoration' as we see today was released (now with this DVD we have to realize that it was more of a 're-creation') . According to Renoir himself, some audience tried to set the theatre on fire at its original release.

With the general acceptance of Renoir as a filmmaker of great humanitarian values, it may be also true that we tend to forget that RULES OF THE GAMES is, unlike GRAND ILLUSION which truly deserves to be popular, a hugely complex, rather in-accessible film to some, and most of all an extremely aggressive social satyre.

The most famous quote from the film is perhaps, Octave saying ""The most terrible thing on this earth is that, everybody has a good reason"", which is often regarded as representing the spirit of the film, as well as Renoir's own humanist philosophy. But what the film may actually be saying is; ""everybody may think he or she has good reasons, but everybody is deceiving him/herself. Everybody is a fool, and everybody is doomed"".

And the French society then, which is symbolically represented in this film mainly as a bunch of aristocrats and high bourgeois, was doomed without realizing themselves; the film was made in 1939 and the central character/the owner of the Chateau de la Coliniere the Marquis de Lachenay, is Jewish. The Nazis had taken power in Germany already 6 years ago, and the film even suggests that anti-Semitism was spreading also in France in every social class (the most anti-Semitic remark in the film is made by one of the servants, nevertheless quickly dismissed by the cook's clever but actually impotent remark), and still they continue the farcical behaviour. The film ends with the General innocently prasing de Lachenay, being ""a class dignity that is dissapearing today"".

Of course, Renoir is exploiting his own gift in comedy to its extreme, so the film is unbelievably funny. It is also beautifully mis-en-scene, many scenes can be studied as a text-book of complex blocking with multiple characters and how a filmmaker can get away with it. But what is lurking beneath the hilarious, light-hearted surface of the film is extremely dark and pessimistic.

One of the most honest remarks about the film may be from Martin Scorsese, who finds the film marvelous ""but I really don't understand it, maybe because I don't come from that social class"". As much as it is one of the greatest--perhaps THE greatest-- social satyre and farce ever filmed, it is not a necessary a film for everybody. But as for those who have extreme sense of humour and irony, GO FOR IT!

The essay by film scholar and Renoir's friend Alexander Sesonske, read by Peter Bogdanovich as audio commentary, can be heard on this DVD as it was already on Criterion's Laser Disc edition, and efficiently puts the film into its social/historical context for our deeper, more precise understanding.

Sesonske also shares fine analysis about Renoir's mise-en-scene that we often miss at first-viewing, for the film on its surface is so fluid, looks even casually shot. it certainly is not! It's one of the film that Renoir went extremely over scheduled, took a hell of a lot of time to put together. And the new High-Def transfer also allows us to observe many detailed techniques Renoir employed; lighting, focus-shifting, moving camera-- of course, after repeated viewing and careful observations.

With the many supplements, especially with the version-comparison, this DVD edition may be the first occasion to shed some clear lights on the film's complex version history that went through so many modifications. First of all, unlike the many legends on Renoir and RULES have told us about ""the original version"", the 1959 restoration (the version also presented on this DVD) IS NOT what Renoir intended to show in 1939, when he first made the film.

This version that we have believed for many years to be the closest to Renoir's original cut is actually more than 10 minutes LONGER, with many scenes that Renoir initially left on the editing room floor.

Dispite the legends that said RULES was cut and mutilated by censorships, it was actually Renoir himself who also cut out about 10 minutes from his original cut, in desperate efforts to make the film visible after the violent reactions caused by the film's premiere.

According to Renoir, there is still one scene that he would have liked to put back--but the materials were lost, and not yet re-discovered to this date.

This Criterion edition is obviously a very important occasion for this film: First of all because of the clear, beautiful transfer that allows us to see the film as almost brand new and observes the many details that we used to miss with inferiors video transfers or even with bad screening prints. Secondly, with the many added information which were selected not with simple-minded cinephilic admiration to the filmmaker, but with a sober intellectual mind of really apreciating the film itself. And also, the handsome jacket design is quite nice.",1104883200,11,5189,4.917714285714286
532000,5,6302969301,"Renoir the unique , the admirable thinker , the great artist, the supreme master, the exquisite director could make an overwhelming tour de force based on the purest tradition of the French comedy . Alfred de Musset ` Les caprices de Marianne (1833) and, Marivaux's The game of love and chance (1730) and Beaumarchais ` s Le marriage de Figaro (1784) were the sources of his inspiration to represent the dramatic situation.

""A precise description of the bourgeois of our age. I want to show that for every game , there are rules . If you don't play according to them , you lose"" ""My ambition was to illustrate this remark: we are dancing on a volcano"" . These words come from Renoir in an interview dated 1938.

Renoir worked in this movie from February to May 1939 . And in his famous autobiography (Ma vie et mes films -1974- (see my review) reported that during the shooting of this greatly improvised film he was torn between my desire to make a comedy of it and the wish to tell a tragic story . The result of this ambivalence was the film as it is .

 The script is an excellent and if I may operatic work . A heroic aviator who lands at Le Bourget after a record transatlantic flight, is acclaimed but he is sad because he expected Christine was there and she did not greet him .

As you well know : hero is the person who makes the things for eros (love) and nothing else . The applauses and world recognition are less than nothing to him ..

He will be invited to the castle of the Marquis , Robert de la Chesnaye , Christine `s aristocratic husband ; nothing more and nothing less . Since he decided to accept these rules of the game our beloved hero will be victim of intercrossed events of the destiny; in a complex web of jealous , hypocrisy , double moral and lack of the real meaning of this celebration in his honor .

The golden mind and the master hands of this French film maker , son of the famous painter Pierre Renoir made possible to give us a jewel of thousand carats .

After a hostile reception and subsequent obstacles , The rules would eventually triumph for the posterity .  Allied bombings destroyed the laboratories where the film's master negative had been stored . And after an never ending odyssey and love for the cinema , three cinephiles , Jean Caborit, Jacques Marchal and Jacques Durand restored the film after discovering thwo hundred boxes of film material recovered from the bombing . The reconstructed film (112 min) was screened at last in 1959 at the Venice Film Festival and reopened in Paris on April 23, 1965.

In 1975 Renoir received an honorary Academy award and was described as "" agenius who, with grace , responsibility and enviable devotion through silent film , sound film ,feature , documentary , and television , has won the world's admiration"".

If I had to take just only ten films to a desert island to prove the greatness of our civilization for the future generations , this would be one of my choices .

I must admit I love this film so much that I watch it twice every year since I got it in 1988 .

532005,5,6302969301,"""The Rules of the Game"" directed by Jean Renoir is now ranked #1 on many film critic lists. Renior built a comedy of manners around old stories. When this film was viewed in Paris in 1939 there was a near riot. The critics hated it for political reasons, but also because characters were walking about the Chateau at amazing speed and angles. If you don't understand the history of the beginnings of WW2, then all will be lost on your Philistine soul. Somehow in an upstairs-downstairs comedy, Renior has described the failed French society. I'll describe the plot concept using English names. Randy, the aviator loves the rich lady, Christine. She's not French; she's Viennese (the only outsider). He's a romantic fool, she's an innocent compared to the Parisian women like Clair, the sophisticated lover of Christine's husband, the Count. Renior plays Alph, a court jester character and friend of Christine from the old days. He's a failed musician. He's also Randy's best friend. The French Count is played by a Jewish actor (which was a scandal in itself considering the anti-Semitism in Europe) So they all leave Paris and go to the country estate of the Count where we meet the servants of the Chateau. Christine's maid, Crystal is playing around with Alph and the newly hired rabbit poacher Jimmy. The gamekeeper, the cuckold Paul chases the amorous Jimmy around the Chateau with a gun for the next forty minutes. All the lovers and friends switch partners amidst declarations of love, slaughter of animals, and fist fights. In the end, noone is in love with anyone and all of society is concerned with the game, which is where he or she were in the first place.

Seeing it in Criterion's spectacular transfer is falling in love again with this landmark of 20th century art.  What was once squinting at a blurry reproduction is now a riveting experience in time travel, taking me back to what it must have been like to see it first run in 1939.  The only thing that's missing are riots in theater, but I can do without that in my living room.
As for the film itself, what's really striking is that what is one level a formalistic imitation of classical French drama interbreeds with some kind of prophetic documentary of sick souls and a sick society.  Remember that in 1939, war was in the cards but nobody new if it would be a passing crisis or gateway to a new dark ages.  Renoir didn't just stare into the abyss, he climbed down for a better look.

The Rules of the Game is probably Renoir's least accessible film for an American audience because the film portrays the French ruling class, which by this time were mostly no longer aristocrats but were the wealthy industrialists who had replaced the aristocrats and were now living in their chateaus.  Most American viewers would not recognize this class or have any idea that Renoir is blaming them for welcoming the rise of fascism in Europe.  With no small amount of disgust, Renoir portrays them as bigoted, blind to the casual cruelty and murder upon which their civilization is built, solely preoccupied with parties and romantic distractions while the continent plunges into war.  The air of foreboding in the film warns us that a slaughter of the innocents is coming, a slaughter that will be looked upon by this class with indifference or, even worse, approval.",1080172800,4,1112,4.994594594594594

All I knew was that, for years, it has consistently placed second on the Sight & Sound polls of the greatest films of all time (Citizen Kane always comes in first).  Now, knowing that a film is considered one of the greatest of all time sometimes means that you are in for a snore.  There are some so-called ""classics"" that just bore me to tears (The Conformist or L'Aventura spring to mind).
Yes, this is one of the greatest movies ever made.  Yes, it is a satire on aristocratic society at the time.  Yes, it was badly received and banned by the Nazis.  Blah, blah, blah - who cares?  The amazing thing is what a joy this movie is to watch.  It is genuinely funny.  I often hear it cited as the main influence on Robert Altman, and now I can understand why.  Instead of criticizing Paul Thomas Anderson for copying Altman, we should appreciate Altman imitating Renoir.  Here we see the big cast without any real central character, the anarchic humor, and the brisk energy that moves everything along.
Like everything in the Criterion Collection, this print LOOKS VERY GOOD.  This is all the more important since the original negative had been destroyed in World War II and for years only second-rate prints were available.  There is a second disc that documents all the travails that this film went through, and how it was edited to several different versions.  The version we have now was restored in the fifties outside (but with the blessing of) Renoir.  This print is 98 minutes long.  The original was 91 minutes, and we are still missing an unimportant scene from that original version.  I would have liked to have had a new documentary with more commentary from contemporary filmmakers (especially Altman who admits that he learned ""the rules of the game from The Rules of the Game"").  However, there is a voice-over commentary track by Peter Bogdonavich, who is as good a film scholar as they come.",1078617600,27,2064,4.651933701657459

532073,5,6302969301,"On its surface, ""The Rules of the Game"" is a light farce involving the couplings - and decouplings - of an assortment of weekend guests staying at the chateau of the Comte de la Cheyniest (Marcel Dalio).  Without knowing any other context, the film can be enjoyed on this level: Renoir's writing (he co-scripted) is witty and his direction is elegant and sublime. His fluid long-shots make you feel like you're gliding along in this rarified - though topsy-turvy - world; and his open approach to the actors is suffused with generosity.  He never allows us to focus on one particular person, or couple, because, in this social world, ""everyone has their reasons"" and everyone's actions bounce and intertwine with everyone else's.
As a homage and updating of a classic French farce, ""Rules"" is flawless; it is, however, as a commentary on the decline of a social order that makes this more than a cinematic souffle.  Shot in 1939, ""between Munich and the War"" as Renoir says, the film is portrait of the European aristocracy where ethical codes (conjugal fidelity above all) are not only violated, but are even dismissed as irrelevant.  Human relationships collapse and reform with sudden ease (witness the gameskeeper and the poacher) and those who cling to outmoded notions of love and faithfulness set themselves up for disaster (such as the aviator).  This is the domestic complement to Renoir's war drama, ""La Grande Illusion"", where the mournful French and German artistocratic officers, having more in common amongst themselves than with the common soldiers of their respective nationalities, lament that mechanized warfare has rendered their class irrelevant.
Both ""Illusion"" and ""Rules"" may seem irrelevant themselves in the US, which did not have a traditional feudal aristocracy.  Yet both films fascinate by showing individuals attempting to survive, and thrive, in worlds where the old, comfortable standards no longer apply.  If the aristocrats in ""Rules"" openly, and rather disinterestedly, conduct affairs with each others' spouses, why shouldn't a humble poacher poach a gameskeeper's wife too?  If ""everyone has their reasons"", the famous quote from the film, then, who's to decide which ""reasons"" are justified or unjust, legitimate or scandalous?
The Criterion double-disc sets its own standards.  The extras are plentiful and fascinating, including interviews from the few remaining cast and crew members, the essay booklet intelligent and penetrating, and the transfer quality of the film is superb considering the film's history (having been cut at its premiere, banned, its original negative destroyed in WWII, and finally reassembled in the late 1950's).  This disc was clearly a labor of love and the effort shows throughout: this disc is worth Criterion's asking price.",1075248000,85,2795,5.3031674208144794
532074,5,6302969301,"Rules of the Game is a film that displays the dishonesty of the French aristocracy and the rules that they play by in order to remain in good standards with their upper class.

The four of them are united with a large group of aristocrats at their chateau for a weekend hunting party and this is where the game truly begins and the rules are set into action, which are even mimicked by the servants.  Rules of the Game is directed by the cinematic genius Renoir and this shines through in this film as the story unfolds.  It should also be mentioned that this film nearly got destroyed during World War II, but was reconstructed in 1959 in order for coming generations to be able to view Renoir's vision of the disappearing French aristocracy.",1074988800,23,1091,4.540816326530612
532075,5,6302969301,"*** NOV-22-2011: ADDED REVIEW OF 2011 BLU-RAY & DVD ***

Criterion now has released 3 editions of this French classic: 2004 DVD edition (blue cover with photos) that has been put out of print, 2011 DVD edition (bright cover with vintage drawing) that has identical content save for a revised supplement, and a corresponding 2011 Blu-ray edition that is a high-def version of the 2011 DVD.

The 2011 Blu-ray and DVD appear to have used the same source that yielded the 2004 DVD.  As those who have seen the 2004 DVD know, the original source is not in the best of shape, even though it is the best material Criterion was able to get.  Google ""nytimes hunting rules of the game"" to see the report on Criterion's effort in tracking down the best material of the film.  So does this Blu-ray look as good as the ""Casablanca"" blu-ray, the ""Gone of the Wind"" blu-ray, the ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" blu-ray?  No, it doesn't.  But as usual, Criterion maintains the integrity of the picture by retaining a lot of film grains on the transfer.  Other studios may use digital noise reduction (DNR) to remove those film grains to not annoy modern viewers.  But Criterion consistently retains film grains on its Blu-rays, thereby retaining a lot of picture details which may have been lost otherwise had DNR been used.  Those who have seen a classic film in theaters would know that film grains are inherent to the pictures from those periods.  These Criterion Blu-rays therefore give you as close to a theatrical experience as you can get.  This Blu-ray also offers 2-3 times higher horizontal and vertical resolutions, 6 times higher video bit rate, and 6 times higher audio bit rate compared to its DVD counterpart, although these advantages benefit more to those with large screen HDTVs and good audio systems.

So what about the revised supplement on the 2011 editions?  On the 2004 edition, the filmmakers' tributes to the film is on the disc.  But on the 2011 editions, they are put on the booklet.

My review of the 2004 DVD is below.

** ORIGINAL REVIEW OF CRITERION 2004 DVD EDITION, JAN-24-2004 **

On the surface, THE RULES OF THE GAME is a frivolous satire of the French ruling class during the interwar years.  But beneath it, this 1939 film is a rather sweeping appraisal on human nature and how the rigidity of our society continues to undermine our humanity.  With a microcosmic cast of characters that comprises of masters and servants, the film weaves an intricate plot about their love, jealousies, deceit, infidelities, hypocrisies, misunderstandings, and, at times, reconciliations, and realignments of friends and foes.  Through their travails, the film depicts a symbolic breakdown, and ultimately restoration, of the prevailing social order, resulting in the film being both a comedy and a tragedy.  Director Jean Renoir also acts in the film, playing the pivotal role of an outsider (obviously a stand-in for the audience).  His character's futile attempts to break into the ""circle"" and to bring about the well-beings of his friends suggest that it is often difficult to survive under the social order, let alone change it.

The Criterion DVD is an all-region two-disc set with a newly restored video transfer and plenty of rewarding extra material.  This eagerly-awaited disc was originally to be released last Fall, when Criterion had already finished a video transfer that would have looked better than any existing copy of the film.  But at the last minute, Criterion received word that an earlier-generation fine-grain master of the film had been located in France, and that additional improvement, though not dramatic, could be made to the picture quality.  Being the perfectionist that it often is, Criterion decided to redo the video transfer based on the fine-grain master, thus delaying the DVD's release by several months.  According to the New York Times article ""Hunting 'The Rules of the Game'"" on Jan-18-04, the redone transfer justified the additional time and cost by yielding more details in dark areas and richer shades of grey on the picture, resulting in a less harsh look and perhaps subliminally making the characters in the film seem more sympathetic.

The DVD's video quality is indeed the best I've ever seen.  Its sharpness and clarity of details are a revelation to those who have seen, for instance, Criterion's laserdisc version years ago.  A digital cleanup process has been used to eliminate much (but not all) of the dirt and blemishes.  The original French audio track has also been improved, and it now sounds cleaner, with almost no hiss and pops, and more detailed.  In a film that relies on its numerous visual and audio details to be effective, the technical improvements made for this DVD are absolutely worthwhile and welcomed.

Accompanying the film is a superb analytical audio commentary written by film historian and Renoir's friend Alexander Sesonske, and read fluidly by Peter Bogdanovich.  Recorded in 1989 for the Criterion laserdisc, this commentary analyzes the intricate relationships of the characters, how their actions often counterpoint one another's, and what Renoir intends to accomplish with them.  It points out that the story creates two groups of quintets, each comprising of a husband, wife, lover, mistress, and interceding friend, and that the actions in one group are often the opposites of the other.  The commentary also mentions the political climate in which Renoir made the film, as well as the classical works (such as The Marriage of Figaro) that inspired Renoir.

A 30-minute excerpt of the 1967 TV documentary ""Jean Renoir, le patron"", originally included in the laserdisc version, is also included in this DVD.  It is essentially an interview of Renoir, who talks about his shooting style, and the themes and characters of the film.  There is also a rather poignant moment of Renoir reuniting with actor Marcel Dalio at the steps of the ""La Colinire,"" where they reminisce about their experience.

The DVD includes a great one-hour documentary on Renoir and RULES OF THE GAME, made by BBC in 1993.  It recalls Renoir's childhood, upbringing, how his love of the movies developed, and his film career up to and including RULES OF THE GAME.  It shows fascinating clips of his early films such as LA FILLE DE L'EAU, CHARLESTON, NANA, LA CHIENNE, BONDU SAVED FROM DROWNING, and others.  It also includes comments from his family members, friends, collaborators, and other filmmakers such as Bertrand Tavernier, Bernardo Bertolucci, and Peter Bogdanovich.

Perhaps the best supplement in the whole DVD set is a ""Version Comparison"" that provides side-by-side comparison of the final scenes in two versions of the film: the shorter 81-minute cut which Renoir reluctantly made in response to criticisms, and the longer 106-minute version that was reconstructed in 1959 (the version used for this DVD's presentation).  Film historian Christopher Faulkner's commentary provides further elucidation on the differences between the two.  Thus, we can plainly see for ourselves that the shorter version drastically eliminates many of the subtleties and alters the meaning of the film's final moments completely.

Also valuable is a 10-minute interview footage of the two people who reconstructed the 1959 version, Jean Gaborit and Jacques Durand.  They recall their multi-year efforts in finding film elements from all over the world, and eventually discovering several minutes of footage that was not in Renoir's original version (one of such footage is the long conversation between Octave and Andr at the knoll in the countryside).

Other extras include an 8-minute ""video essay"" (a featurette) on the film's production history, 3 interview segments, and several written tributes by today's filmmakers, which include a few pretty thoughtful mini-essays on the film as well as succinct comments such as that from Robert Altman: ""THE RULES OF THE GAME taught me the rules of the game.""",1074902400,201,7969,5.087624903920061
532076,5,6302969301,"This is yet another fabulous DVD from the Criterion Collection. The packaging is neat: presented in a fold-out case enclosed within a blue plastic outer-shell. There's two disks in this set - the film itself and some extras, such as interviews and a BBC bio of Jean Renior's career as a filmmaker.
This classic film is a look at class divisions in France between the world wars. It's similar in style to the recent ""Gosford Park"" but with a whole lot more poignancy. Whereas Gosford looks back nostalgically, Rules of the Game does so with a judgemental vengence. There's a lot of passion behind this film, which is probably what initially scared most reviewers when the film first premiered.
Great movie - Great DVD",1074729600,3,716,4.782258064516129
532114,5,6302969301,"Jean Renoir's Rules of the Game is a classic among classics in cinema.  One would be hard pressed to find a reputable critic who doesn't put this film in  their top-ten films of all time.  This isn't just a critics' film either.  It is filled with satiric wit and brilliant ideas, not to mention it's look and pace.  That said, when Criterion puts out a film like this with the extras they unearth, the price is reasonable.  When this company releases a film you know you are going to get a pristine transfer, (of a 65 year-old film) and extras that actually get into the film.  Not an HBO making of featurette that has the actors telling you what you already know.  These are featurettes that they have licenced from European broadcasters or small independent companies.
A good example is Criterion's release of Tarkovsky's Solaris versus Soderberg's Solaris which was released by Universal.  Criterion's extras are head and shoulders above the Universal release.  As much as I loved Soderberg's version of the novel, the extras were painfully out of place.
When Criterion releases a film (especially in a double disc edition as is Rules of the Game) it isn't merely just your average dvd release, it is almost an event.  And worth every penny.",1074556800,,1245,4.771028037383178
532115,5,6302969301,"Everything one needs to know about life.

If you want to sit back and observe humanity, perhaps learn some universal truths, and still have an enjoyable time, then ""Rules of the Game"" is for you.  There isn't one moment in this movie that rings false.  Every scene, every word is so devoid of guile that you may catch yourself seemingly eavesdropping on this group humans serving and being served on the eve of a holocaust no one has any interest in discussing.  It is a breathtaking experience, and yet the movie is almost simple, almost ephemeral.

... And after ""Rules of the Game,"" if you've yet to catch it, don't miss Renoir's equally amazing, ""Grande Illusion.""

Caveat:  Like all of Renoir's films, ""Rules of the Game"" is an unhurried, languidly-paced movie.  It is likely to bore and/or disappoint those unable to sit still through anything but quick cuts and in-your-face action.",1064966400,3,889,4.841059602649007
532116,5,6302969301,"""The greatest film ever made"" is a difficult phrase to fling.  I agree that ""Rules of the Game"" must be one of them.  At the start, it seems merely dressed up and ordinary.  You won't be disappointed, however.  And if you are not impressed by the Stooge-like freneticism and theatricality of the climactic scenes, well, you've missed the point.  We can only endure so much critcism and shock -- at some point we have to enjoy life, all of us.  Note the ""comme les autres"" line as the party ends and also instances of the proverbial offering of cigarettes.  The enjoyments in life are to be shared.
And, YES !  I researched the net about this film :  nearly every comment includes a statement professing that this is a contender for the greatest film ever made.  So, why no DVD ?
I didn't like the shooting scene in ""Gosford Park"" either.  It's true, times change.  What was uncomfortable 70 years ago seems shocking to us today.  It's the idea of showing it, too.  Why ?  Whatever is to be accomplished by showing scenes of animal mistreatment can surely be done in some other way.  Especially considering the resourcefulness required in making a movie in the first place.
[Not to complain, but, I don't know why you can't do home editing of DVDs.  We should be able to edit out what we don't want to see.  I'd certainly remove the killing in the hunting scene for personal viewing.  I've seen it once.  That's plenty.]
By the way, I've long wished I could lift my favorite scenes and make some personal DVD's showing just my fondest cinematic memories.  That should be okay for personal use and not infringe on the rights of the film people.  I mean, I already own the film in its entirety, right ?
There are more things to laud and applaud in ""Rules of the Game"" than can be comfortably mentioned in any review.  Many great moments.  Great script, great directing, great acting, tremendous pacing, wonderful cinematography, tremendous window into the times, etc., etc.  So, you'll just have to see it, I guess.",1062547200,2,2012,4.6

I watched this mov, knowing it was called a masterpiece, but guessing that it would be boring like all french films. How wrong I was! I actually liked the style, it almost looked like some american comedies from the 30's!
Well, the major importance of the mov is social critique and the behaviour in the best families of that time and Jean Renoir manages to it well. You see for instance the character of Marcel Dalio fighting with a guy then offering him a cigarette few moments later. Attention to the symbols of the hunt for the rabbits like it would be the party.
The mov simply doesn't hit me as some brit and american masterpieces. By the way, I found the actress who played Lisette very pretty too.",1039824000,,720,4.462121212121212
532119,5,6302969301,"RULES OF THE GAME is the CITIZEN KANE of France.  The 2 films were made within 2 years of one another; both used innovative techniques such as deep-focus photography, long takes, and overlapping dialogs; both were rejected by the public upon its first release and re-discovered in the fifties.  Fittingly, both films were often ranked side by side in many polls of the greatest films ever made.  Most importantly, the two films succeeded where few films did: advancing the art of film, providing spectacular entertainment, and shedding profound insights on the human condition.
(I will reveal plot details below; those who haven't seen RULES please read no further!  My brief analysis of the film, of course, does not do justice to it.)  Though a comedy on the surface and raucous at times, RULES consistently delves into the dark themes of deceit and death.  Throughout the film we see lies being told, infidelity being committed, hypocrisy being carried out.  At the film's midpoint, the violent, belligerent nature of man is potently depicted in a barrage of killings that occur in the famous hunting sequence.  Near the end, the film teases us briefly when enemies seem to reconcile and past offenses are about to be forgiven.  Then, in one of the most memorable endings in film, death and deceit resurface: a man is shot to death as a result of an extramarital love affair, and his death is explained away neatly as an accident in order to hide all the ""dirty linen""; it is a moment that makes you laugh out loud at its absurdity and sigh in sadness at the same time.  The film concludes with one of the most haunting images: a funereal procession of the shadows of people moving past our view.
To paraphrase the old general in the film, films like RULES are ""a rare breed"" indeed.",986169600,2,1786,4.750809061488673
532120,5,6302969301,"Jean Renoir's THE RULES OF THE GAME takes place on the eve of World War II at an aristocratic house party in an opulent chateau just outside of Paris where the overlapping `affaires d'amour' of all social classes are observed with a keen and compassionate eye.  Renoir looks to the eighteenth-century world of Commedia dell'Arte and Mozartian opera, and seamlessly integrates farce with tragedy, using a classical form to offer his audience a profound and multifaceted parable on the disturbing realities that underlie the veneer of contemporary French society.
It is the middle-class aviator, Andr Jurieu (Roland Toutain), who embodies the film's central conflict between the private passions and a sense of obligation to a larger social body.  Right at the outset of the film, he violates the unwritten ""rules"" of social propriety by declaring to a radio reporter his disappointment that the woman he had been courting, Christine de la Chesnaye (Nora Grgor), is not present at his reception after completing a record-breaking flight across the Atlantic.  His skill with the advanced technology of aircraft is not matched by an ability to deal with people, particularly in matters of love.  Indeed, Andr's careless and unmediated show of desire for a highborn lady not only transgresses the received law of proper social conduct but of traditional class distinctions as well.
Other characters also entertain desires that come into conflict with the social order.  The Marquis, Robert de la Chesnaye (Marcel Dalio), is having a fling with Genevive de Marrast (Mila Parly) behind Christine's back, and Genevive is sincerely attached to him and wants for them to go away together yet he maintains the proper outward appearance, and out of politeness and consideration for his wife's feelings, keeps up the charade that their affair is a secret in spite of the fact that ""everybody knows.""  Christine observes her husband's liaison with strange amusement, commenting that they look ""very interesting"" together - for her adultery is a form of entertaining spectacle.  But even Robert loses his cool at one point when he discovers Christine and Andr together in the gunroom and punches the aviator in the face.
Strangely enough, it is only the classless Pandarus-figure, Octave, who can get through to the serenely unattainable Christine because he seems to have no particular desires of his own; he only concerns himself with regulating the desires of others.  Octave confesses that, like Marcello Mastrioanni in Fellini's LA DOLCE VITA, he is ""a failure"" who merely pleases his friends so that he may live off their wealth like ""a parasite.""  Apparently, Christine loves him for his understanding that everything in life, every social relationship, is really a lie of some sort, and that all desire and romantic fantasy is, at bottom, a blind form of narcissistic self-deception.  It seems that the two of them have come to understand the law that underpins desire - ""La Rgle de Jeu"" - all too well.
As Pauline Kael has pointed out, Renoir may have conceived Robert de la Chesnaye as a composite of two different characters in GRAND ILLUSION: Marcel Dalio's rich young mercantile Jew, Rosenthal, and the generous, self-sacrificing French nobleman, De Boeldieu, played by Pierre Fresnay.  Here, the director appears to equate the waning aristocracy of Old World Europe with the imminent fate of the European Jewish community in the wake of rising nationalism, militarism, and xenophobia.  When a chef makes an anti-Semitic slight against the Robert, revealing the bigotry of the French working classes, it evokes the controversy surrounding the Dreyfus Affair.  By the same token, the General's final comment that Robert is one of a ""dying breed"" not only heralds the decay of aristocratic privilege but, from the vantage point of hindsight, also seems a chilling spectre of Nazi racialist ideology and the Final Solution.
Christine's Austrian origin alludes to the looming war with Germany and seems a prediction of France's collaboration under the Vichy rgime.  Likewise, the reference to Schumacher's home of Alsace-Lorraine, the highly contested land ceded to the Germans at the end of the Franco-Prussian war in 1871 and then returned to France with the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, highlights an old geopolitical conflict between the two countries.  The indiscriminate destruction of life in the rabbit and pheasant hunt sequence forecasts the waste and destruction of the war to come.
Renoir's approach to mise-en-scne is especially groundbreaking.  He employs seamless cutting as well as long continuous takes and tracking shots which follow the characters as they move from one space to the next in a manner that anticipates the graceful circling, panning, sensuously kinetic camera of Welles, Ophls, Godard, Resnais, Bertolucci and others.  He uses deep-focus compositions, avoiding close-ups by putting many actors in the frame at the same time to suggest multiple viewpoints.  The balustrades of La Colinire and the languorous tracking shots down the long corridors undoubtedly inspired those in LAST YEAR AT MARIENBAD while the checkered floor suggests a harlequinade and a chess board upon which the characters maneuver themselves in relation to each other - like the similarly checkered shuffleboard floor in Antonioni's LA NOTTE or the geometrically precise arrangement of the garden in MARIENBAD.  (Interestingly enough, Coco Chanel designed the costumes for both THE RULES OF THE GAME and LAST YEAR AT MARIENBAD).
Octave's gorilla suit at the party implies a regression of human behavior to a more primitive state, setting up a conflict between barbarism and civilized life, between the savage realities of human desire and the law of the social contract that contains them as theatrical spectacle.  The Shakespearean convention of ""the play within the play"" appears - just as it does in THE GOLDEN COACH - in various forms throughout the film, the most ominous being the `danse macabre,' echoed in the sance and ritual journey to the realm of the dead in LA DOLCE VITA, suggesting that Renoir's superficial `affaires d'amour' are really a dance of death heralding the apocalyptic destruction of the old Europe.",972000000,73,6226,5.244466800804829
532121,3,6302969301,"I saw this in a film class, and I know I'll be lynched for this, but I found it pretty draggy. There were some terrific scenes, and I think the cinematography was some of the best I'd ever seen (especially the dinner  party scenes and how they flowed from one couple to the next so smoothly in  was seemed like one take), I think this could have used a harsher edit.  I  can see how it is a classic, but scenes such as the rabbit hunting scene  could have been trimmed down a bit. Perhaps I'm being too critical.

Renoir was very much a  natural behind and in front of the camera, and it is evident in this film  that he wanted a certain seamlessness to carry through the process.  But  here as happens in another of his films, 'The River' (though in a different  fashion), his poetics are often bisecting the ""pure cinema"" in  surprising ways.  There is something arresting about the visuals in this  film, as opposed to the more transparent dialogue of a film like 'The Grand  Illusion'.

That notwithstanding this is a great film of manners and a bit of a sent up of life among the upper set and their foibles in the late Third Republic. The nice trick is that these foibles are placed on display by Renoir for the servants and for us to see-and comment on.

The storyline is pretty convention as such comedic efforts go. It is the cinematography and scene-settings that are the remarkable parts of the film.
A famous French aviator on the order of Charles Lindberg in his country, Andre, is head over heels in love with Christine the wife of rich landowner, Robert, with a country estate well outside of Paris (of course having a place in town as well). Robert has his own liaisons and life but one must keep up appearances. The long and short of the situation is that Octave a mutual friend of Andre and Roberts wrangles an invitation for Andre to go to the country estate for a time. There all hell breaks loose as all the various romantic machinations are played out between Andre and Christine, Robert and his lover, Christines maid and her husband, the gamekeeper of the estate, and a budding thing the maid had with a poacher.

Nothing good can come of this and nothing does, at least for Andre who winds up dead, very dead after a famous scene where the gamekeeper who had spied in the greenhouse someone whom he thought was his wife with Andre and after a couple of identity miscues shot him dead. After all this high speed romance and intrigue the highest level of energy the landowner Robert could come up with is that the whole thing was an accident. This is one time that the simplicity of the plot-line does not convey the intricacies of the goings-on. So see this world classic film that back in the late 1960s and early 1970s was playing almost continuously at the Brattle Theater in Cambridge as a whole generation rediscovered what great film-making was all about. Rediscovered those foreign film gems that the French in particular were producing before film noir hit the world.",1462147200,,2429,4.556064073226545
