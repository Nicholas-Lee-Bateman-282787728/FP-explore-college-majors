7463801,5,B01690GTTA,"I watched this film at an advanced festival screening along with Mr. Oppenheimer, and it was introduced as a kind of ""perfect"" film.  Needless to say it made me extremely skeptical about what I was about to see, particularly as how I did not quite appreciate the cinematic work of Act of Killing which precedes it to the extent that it was heralded.  Viewers should know that Look of Silence is a companion piece to the aforementioned, and instead of telling the stories from the perpetator's pov, it puts us into one of the victim's brothers--a far more interesting and sympathetic character.

Despite the grand introduction, I left in complete agreement, considering it one of the greatest films made this decade.  This is a remarkable cinematic achievement, one that absolutely cannot be missed.  Beautiful and haunting unlike many other poorly filmed documentaries, this film is a visual masterpiece.",1453248000,8,904,5.081081081081081

7463803,5,B01690GTTA,"Once again, Oppenheimer has provided us with a rare opportunity to glimpse into the psyche of the perpetrators of horrific genocide. It is extremely difficult to watch. In my opinion, it is imperative to watch. Human beings are capable of holding and compartmentalizing very disparate beliefs. If we don't attempt to understand this, we are destined to repeat it ,or at the very least, ""wring our hands"" as it happens over and over, and never believe that each of us is both vulnerable and responsible. The optometrist is very brave. I am awed by his self control in the presence of the men who murdered his brother. This film terrifies and infuriates me. I am thankful that Oppenheimer (and staff, crew) and the Optometrist had the courage and grace to confront this issue.

7463806,5,B01690GTTA,"Joshua Oppenheimers extraordinary follow-up to The Act of Killing follows an optometrist in his 40s whose brother was killed in the Indonesian massacre of civilians by the military government under the excuse of killing Communists.  The murderers have never been brought to justice and are still in positions of power around the country.  Adi Rukun, the questioner, refuses to answer when these men ask him questions that might identify his family and where they live.  In one particularly chilling scene, one of his subjects all but comes right out and tells him that he will find and kill his family if he persists in his questioning.  None of the killers express remorse and some relate what happened with apparent glee.  Many of them say that the victims supposedly did not even pray, as if that were adequate justification--a frightening glimpse of life in a theocracy.  It is rare that one has the opportunity to witness true bravery on screen rather than a mere depiction of it.  Count the number of times Anonymous is credited in the closing credits to get an idea of how brave this man and his family are to allow their faces to appear in the film.  It is not possible to undo the tragedies of the past, but this film and its predecessor accomplish the deeply moral objective of bearing witness so that future generations can learn from these monstrous acts, the survivors might find some measure of peace, and the victims do not disappear entirely into the fog of history.",1467244800,,1482,4.784313725490196

7463813,5,B01690GTTA,"The 2012 Oscar-nominated documentary, ""The Act of Killing"", garnered world-wide praise and many awards for its shocking look into the current lives of the perpetrators of genocide in Indonesia during the mid-sixties.  Its filmmaker was Texas-born verified genius Joshua Oppenheimer who lives in Denmark and has been making films since 1998.  ""The Look of Silence""  is its companion piece, and where the earlier documentary was outwardly horrifying, this one is more quietly disturbing and, I believe, the more important.

After my viewing of it finished at 7 a.m., I was lowering myself into a warm bathtub when suddenly I became haunted by the feeling that headless bodies were floating past me as if I were in the Snake River where the corpses had been dumped. Indeed, I couldn't put the film out of my head the rest of the day, and haven't since.  The film follows an Indonesian man named Adi Runkun whose brother had been brutally murdered in the 1965 purge of 'communists' as he confronts, in the present day and under the pretext of dispensing eye exams, the men who had carried out the killings (and who had boasted and joked about the carnage in ""The Act of Killing"").  We also see Adi's humane caretaking of his nearly dead father whom he bathes and consoles, and other family members who have had to live among his brother's murderers for decades.  What makes this film so effective is how Adi refuses to display any emotion at the killers while the director continues to portray them as human beings rather than monsters (no revenge film this), but Adi's silent stare keeps burning into their souls as they squirm uncomfortably, stubbornly offering lame excuses while refusing any expressions of regret.  By this method Oppenheimer makes the film much more of an iconic document of man's inhumanity to man, forcing viewers to contemplate parallels in history, most especially the nazis who perpetrated the Holocaust in Hitler's Germany.

There is nothing easy about this film, yet it is one of the few films you must not miss if you have a heart that pumps blood.",1457049600,,2074,4.869318181818182

7463817,5,B01690GTTA,"This is a film that brings the horrific slaughter of millions in Indonesia to the forefront with the victim's families questioning the murderers. Anyone considered a Communist in 1956 , was killed wantonly and brutally, and for sixty years, most everyone denies anything took place. No one wants to relive the tragedies, it is better to turn a blind eye.

However, a young man, Adi, who's in his forties interviews the murderers. Adi is an opthamologist, and he brings his office out into the countryside, into the home. He tells the people he likes to talk to old people to hear about the old days, while he is examining their eyes. What he wants to know is about the murder of his older brother, Ramli.  Adi's parents, are in their 100's, and his mother continues to care for his blind father. The irony is interesting, in that the murderers do not want to see, and it is the victim's family who cannot see.

Adi, while talking, examines the murders eyes, another great irony. We are privy to see on film the story of the brutal murders. Adi, however, remains calm and collected,  and it is his behavior that we will most remember.

Joshua Oppenheimer brings us this remarkable film. 'The Look of Silence' is nominated for an Academy Award in the documentary category. It is one of the more remarkable documentaries I have seen. It is up against stiff competition against 'Amy', but this documentary deserves the Oscar.

7463822,5,B01690GTTA,"A work of magnificence in its own category, along with its prequel. This is the kind of documentary that blurs the line between journalism and anthropological research, documenting a still unresolved piece of history that would strike the viewer as science fiction if the evidence was not so amply laid out for us. Genocide is almost cheapened by frequent use in reports on global conflict today, or the obsessive hindsight we pay toward Soviet and Nazi regimes. Even if the crimes in this film were brought to trial, we're given a first-hand demonstration that guilt and amends are not properly made without tactile understanding of what happened, how and why it happened, and who the victims are, behind a headline or statistic.
Oppenheimer offers us an unflinching gaze into the abyss of human carnage and cognitive dissonance, propaganda and the banality of evil, inviting the viewer (along with untried war criminals interviewed for the film) to confront what it means for humans to commit violence on one another. Every war (including current conflicts) deserves this kind of transparent, delicate, yet powerful analysis of what happens when the ""fog"" of war descends and then blows away like a hurricane.

I was moved, after seeing Silence, to read everything I could about the history of the Indonesian genocide of 1965, and on a smaller scale, about the fate of Adi Rukun. In the film, Adi, at great personal risk, confronts numerous individuals who had a role in the death of his older brother Ramli, who was brutally tortured to death by a local paramilitary organization while the US-backed military looked on.

The Look of Silence is Joshua Oppenheimer's follow-up to his fascinating documentary The Act of Killing, which dealt with the legacy of massacres of so-called Communists by paramilitary groups and their followers in Indonesia in 1965. This time Oppenheimer focuses in on an optometrist, Adi Rukun, who goes around interviewing various men and their family members involved in the 1965 massacres, some of whom were directly involved in the murder of his older brother.

As in the Act of Killing, the murderers are well-known pillars of their community, proudly boasting about their role in the massacres.
Oppenheimer utilizes footage from the Act of Killing which Rukun looks at on a TV screen. In one sequence, the main killer of the man's
brother, along with an accomplice friend, are interviewed at the very spot where the brother was murdered. They joke about how they killed
the brother which involved cutting off his genitals and slitting his throat.

Rukun interviews another killer who soon objects to his ""political questions."" He cuts the interview off as it's clear he doesn't like
dealing with the moral questions that are being raised. The killer is vague about how the victims were identified as Communists. At one point
he mentions that they failed to attend the local mosque for prayer services. He also mentions that there were rumors of some people having
extramarital affairs which would have implicated them as ""bad people.""

It soon becomes obvious that virtually anyone could have been accused of being a Communist back then. The victims might have been a
collection of all types of people from varying socio-economic classes: union activists, non-religious people, those accused by neighbors
trying to settle a score, and thousands who were completely apolitical and had no affiliation with Communism.

The demented nature of the killers became clear when more than person being interviewed admitted that they drank their victim's blood. They
did so, according to these men, because if they didn't, they would have gone ""crazy.""

Family members of the perpetrators often claimed no knowledge that their kin were involved in the massacres. Some of these people stated
that the past needed to be left alone and a few even implied that those who persisted in looking at the past could be subject to retaliation
in the present day.

Eventually Rukun pays a call on his uncle who worked as a prison guard in 1965. The uncle had no guilt feelings as to his role in the
massacres and claimed that since he didn't kill anyone directly, he bore no responsibility for the killings. When Rukun informs his mother
of this, she's incredulous that her brother may have been involved in the death of her son.

In addition to the various killers interviewed, we also meet Rukun's centenarian father who is blind and almost deaf as well as his mother
who harbors a great deal of bitterness over her neighbors who have escaped the bar of justice.

Between The Act of Killing and The Look of Silence, the former has more of an overall impact. James Lattimer writing in Slant gets to the root
of the problem with Oppenheimer's current approach: ""With the previous film and most of this one already having repeatedly plumbed the depths of depravity with which such killings were carried out, it's hard to understand why the protagonist needs to be placed in such a manifestly wrenching position, aside from a salacious desire to have his reaction on camera.""

Despite reservations as to the way the material is presented, The Look of Silence remains a fascinating glimpse into the mindset of people who have committed horrendous crimes and escaped the bar of justice.",1453939200,3,3710,4.978998384491114

Human rights' are a fine thing, but how can we make ourselves sure that our rights do not expand at the expense of the rights of others. A society with unlimited rights is incapable of standing to adversity. If we do not wish to be ruled by a coercive authority, then each of us must rein himself in...A stable society is achieved not by balancing opposing forces but by conscious self-limitation: by the principle that we are always duty-bound to defer to the sense of moral justice.

One young optometrist Adi viewed 100s of hours of uncut interviews with murderers for Act of Killing with curiosity and deep sadness; those who tortured and murdered his brother boast of the grisly details on film.  Before the Act of Killing was released, Adi asked Oppenheimer to film him, Adi, talking with his brother's assailants. The film project involved extraordinary risk for Adi, his wife, children, his elderly mother, his blind senile paralyzed father, Oppenheimer and Danish crew.

The filming window of opportunity was narrow and had to occur before The Act of Killing was released at which point Oppenheimer's life would be forfeit if he attempted return to Indonesia. Preparations had to be in place to immediately flee after each interview segment in case of threatening repercussions.

For 50 years victim families have lived side by side with those who murdered their loved ones, intimidated into silence by fear. The Act of Killing offered Indonesians an opportunity to see in themselves the potential for Hannah Arendt's ""banality of evil"" no ""particularity of wickedness, pathology or ideological conviction in the doer whose only personal distinction was a perhaps extraordinary shallowness."" Arendt's depiction of a ""quite authentic inability to think"" is countered by The Look of Silence's observation of shuttered faces, weak rationalizations, when Adi offers the opportunity for apology forgiveness resolution ""you killed my brother.""

The Look of Silence posits evil is not an inability to think so much as active conscious suppression of thought, replaced by a media celebrity attitude toward mass murder.

Adi is an optometrist. After his volunteer work on The Act of Killing with Oppenheimer, out of curiosity, Adi began inquiring of all patients over the age of 60 what they recalled of 1965. All were delighted to regale with their tales of murder, or terror. Murderer faces reveal how political and financial advantage gained through genocide compromises the ability to think. The lies we tell ourselves prevent us from being authentic with ourselves. Murderers' script themselves as altruistic with giddy bragging strutting swagger. Cultural fabric is rent, morality is left unexamined.

Genocidal trauma resonates through multiple generations, children and grandchildren, who now carry the family truths for both perpetrator and victim.
