8328449,1,B001NZ020O,"Quite possibly the worst civil war movie ever. Also it has ""Guy Gane III "" acting in it, and he and his father are known investment frauds, convicted felons and thieves. He's currently serving 13 years for robbing over 7 million from investors.",1405900800,,244,4.6976744186046515
8328450,5,B001NZ020O,"I am biased to support the production, but I know that great care and attention was paid during the writing and production to make sure that all aspects of the presentation was as honest, and authentic as possible for the viewer - making it an ideal project for anyone interested in the American Soldier of the Civil War - incredible scale and incredibly detailed recreations of the battle of Gettysburg - intense combat and excellent, layered soundtrack - great for students of American history and for teachers in the classroom. Highly recommended.",1335916800,,550,4.989130434782608
8328451,5,B001NZ020O,"""Gettysburg: Darkest Days and Finest Hours"" is the Gettysburg Anniversary Committee's and Lionheart Filmworks' depiction of the largest battle in American History. Commemorating the battle's 145th Anniversary, most of the film was shot at the massive battle reenactment held in July 2008, where nearly 15,000 men recreated the deciding battle of the American Civil War. While more a documentation of the reenactment than an actual documentary on the battle itself, it is a unique opportunity to see history come alive.

8328452,2,B001NZ020O,"It was difficult to hear the narration, and most of the content was reenactment and computer graphics. I didn't find it easy to follow. I would recommend ""The Unknown Civil War Series: Gettysburg"" and ""Greatest Battles of the Civil War"" dvd presentations as better choices.",1252368000,,273,5.088888888888889
