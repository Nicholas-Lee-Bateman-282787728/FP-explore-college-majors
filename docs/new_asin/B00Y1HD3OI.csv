7207346,5,B00Y1HD3OI,I ended up watching this twice.  Really gave me a lot to thinking about. This documentary shows the impact of fast fashion from the farm to the retail floor. Shopping till you drop -  especially for cheap clothes- has a much bigger impact on humans and the environment than we would ever imagine. Just because that top or skirt is $8 doesn't mean you should buy it. Highly recommend.,1433721600,6,383,4.536231884057971
7207347,5,B00Y1HD3OI,"Words cannot express the shock I feel after watching this documentary. I buy from H&M, Gap, and other brands. I use Amazon to buy clothes. I didn't imagine that some of my old clothing would end in a landfill and pollute the land. I didn't know the leather bags I would buy could have been polluting the water in India, I didn't know that my dollars were being used to buy cheaper ways to make clothing and abuse people. I catch myself sometimes thinking, ""Why did I buy you again? Did I really need you?"" I now understand am a consumer buying out of habit and wasting money. I now understand how big of a problem this really is.

The only questions that I have are how to stop this cycle? The answer from the documentary was to do away with capitalism but socialism and communism aren't any better. So then what socioeconomic system do we use? How are people going to survive if we don't trade and barter with money, goods, and services? This is the way our societies work. Should we all go back to being nomads? Should most of us die so that some of us can have enough? What will it take to treat everyone with respect and give them enough to live on without destroying our individual way of life, our homes, or our land? There are a lot of people in this world. A lot. We clothe ourselves, feed ourselves, transport ourselves everyday and use our clothing, our food and water, the gas in our car or the bus were in, the battery in the vehicle, etc. We do the same thing everyday. Eventually this will strain our planet. Too many people are consuming everything the planet has to offer. So what will it take to have balance? Is this a question we want to hear the answer to? Are we ready to do exactly what the answer says that we do? If we are not ready to make a tough decisions on population and consumption, then we shouldn't produce documentaries such as this.

If we were to stop right now, how would we protect ourselves from disease and infection? If we keep going, how many diseases would we get?
If we were to stop right now, how would we clothe, transport, and do everything for ourselves? If we keep going, how polluted would our world be?

 People will stop buying so much clothing,but the clothes they would buy will eventually go into a landfill. The sheets they would buy will end up somewhere. The laces they would buy will go somewhere too. It will all be wasted. So people won't be driving cars anymore, the buses and trains used to transport people will still use up energy. Those nuclear power plants in every developed country aren't shutting down any time soon. So people will eat less and grow their own food, make their own wine, etc but they still will need to eat meat or suffer deficiencies in their diet. They will still need to use pesticides to keep bugs off of their produce. They will still ask for modified food.

We live in a catch-22 world. If we don't keep going we will kill our species. If we keep on going however we will kill our planet and our species. However if we stop abruptly for environmental and social issues we would cause war, famine, and those will lead to death. I'm grateful to have watched this documentary, it was mind opening, but you must know that you have opened Pandora's box. Nothing or nothing good will come from this. I could be wrong. Maybe the world will prove me wrong. But if I'm right, I worry about the world to come.",1433548800,3,3391,4.376190476190477

It is absolutely heart breaking to come face to face with the realities associated with our worldwide consumeristic tendency towards ""fast fashion.""  Almost all of us are guilty of indulging in cheap clothes, with so many of us raised that getting a bargain was something to be proud of.  But this movie really brings into focus the true atrocities directly related to the toxic and dangerous conditions they create.

We can't just look at the pretty side of fast trading fashion any more. It is not only low-priced garments that are made in inhumane ways, but designer goods as well. Why don't we think about what we could do to change this horrible trend and share our ideas? My personal first step is to shop for clothes first at thrift stores (charity shops).

While watching the film, it makes you look around your living space and particularity around your clothes closet(s) and wonder: ""What was I thinking?""
It is disheartening and even stomach churning to see the mountains of garbage and trash that surround the beautiful people of the world who literally have nothing but their gifts from [their] god of humility and humanity. In the end, it makes you feel somewhat ashamed, embarrassed, and forlorn that it is truly not things that make us happy. Here in the USA we are all too busy being human doings rather than human beings, with our little cheap gadgets that are traps of pre-determined obsolescence.

This movie brings back reality and it makes us realize that the problem starts with us.

7207376,5,B00Y1HD3OI,"Fantastic eye-opener of a documentary about where and how our garments are made. I watched this with my 14-year-old daughter. She could name some of the ""stars"" of the YouTube haul videos. I hope she never watches those uncritically again. She and I have volunteered at the local charity clothing shop, sorting bags of donated clothing. About half of it is either soiled or out of season, so that stuff has to go into bags that get sold for pennies to companies that probably send them to other countries. The charity shop we volunteer in has a mountain going up to the ceiling of garbage bags filled with donated clothing that has yet to be sorted. Before seeing that, I used to think I was doing the charity shop a favor by donating our used clothes. If you see the amount and the quality of stuff they have to sort through every day, you will realize most of what you donate does not get sold to people in your community, because it is soiled, out of fashion, out of season, or possibly buried under a never-ending trash mountain. The only way to do a favor to your communities, local and global, is to avoid buying the cheaply made crap clothing in the first place.",1471046400,7,1169,4.4672897196261685

7207378,5,B00Y1HD3OI,"I used to view the world in black and white with a little grey smeared around the edges for character.  Its what we are taught. The rules of the education system. Yes or No answers. And those questions and answers that don't make any sense (why does the C sometimes sound like an S) are not grey reasons  it is just The Way It Is, and we only need to memorize any discrepanciesnot dissect them for meaning. ""Wah, Wah, Wah, Waah, as Charlie Browns teachers would say.

Now that I am nearing 40-years-old  far from the brainwashing of primary school  I have realized the world, for the most part, operates under the black and white paradigm in direct contrast to reality of the world not being outlined in black and white and smudges of grey, but it is full of color. Vibrant colors drape the world in a fashionable way as a womens sari in India or as stifling as a vivid sunset at the humid equator.  Of course, it didn't take me this long to figure it out. Thats what your aquarius20s are forif you are looking for it and allow yourself time.

Its actually quite ironic because higher education is the opposite of the traditional public school systems of K-12.  At community college or universities, they want you to think. To ask questions. To ponder. And it almost seems too late by then. I remember taking a humanities class called The Age of Aquarius where we dissected the 60s and 70s.  This was my parents coming-of-age generation and I already understood it somewhat, I mean I was born in 1976 so only got to experience it in a time when I cant remember  my memories are the materialistic 80s, while living in poverty. So I took this class and realized social justice on a macro scale  the cries for justice to get out of Vietnam, equal rights from the Black Panthers (I was born in 1980s_Madonna_styleDetroit so understood this more than most), and other cries of injustice. These cries were not just illegitimate screams, but were orchestrated through books, documentaries, songs, poetry, gatherings, and the like.

It was now 1996 as I sat in this community college class in Midwest City, Oklahoma (ended up there by marrying a guy I had met in the military in Guam  who professed a long, heart-felt letter to President Clinton that he could no longer serve and was given an honorable discharge a year early so he could move back to his native land) and thought, What are our social injustices? I was actually a little jealous of these passionate songs and this age of meaning where people banded together for some cause. Here I was living in a vacuum, newly married and living on my husbands land, working full-time, going to church, and attending school like a good girl, yet feeling quite empty. Feeling stuck and knowing there were injustices out there  I could literally feel it in my bones  but what were they? For I knew injustices were going on, but oh, how they were hidden under dial-up internet porn and cheap, manufactured homes in 1996, and the middle-class small town in the Midwest. My ex-husband was like 1/35 Indian after-all and played his flute that he had carved himself. But that was as deep as it got. While playing his flute, it was fine to also slip some ecstasy and go into any dance club and rave, rave, rave. guam 1990s3That was authentic and true at the time. Of course hitchhiking to a Rainbow Gathering was something to do to feel at one with nature, but honestly that was just an alternative rave with the DJ replaced by drums and E replaced with marijuana. The orgy was bigger in the woods, as it was almost a mandate to be naked and to bathe in rivers. That was neo-hippiedom. Oh, us rightly named X-generation, who grew up on Material Girl, VHS, and Pop-tarts. That we would somehow rise up at some clumsy point was inevitable, but it took us awhile to get off the waterbeds and to find the remote to turn off the TVs in our bedrooms (The Cosby Show was too good  and equality at its best  I mean, whats there to complain about?).

But it really wasn't all kicks and giggles. I guess just like the Age of Aquarius class waited a couple of decades to really analyze this time period, its easier now (gulp) 20 years later to look back at the 90s and realize how screwed up it was. Certainly civil rights in America were still far from being equal, as well as gender rights, and a slew of other disparities, but, I think moreover this is where globalization really entered the scene in unprecedented ways. Of course, at the time I didn't realize this because I was too busy renting movies from Blockbuster, working at some mundane job, and occasionally going to raves  and feeling almost too old to join in at 21-years-old. But, I could never fit in at this lifestyle and my husband was also feeling a new wave of patriotism so re-joined the Navy while I traveled the world with my mother. Guatemala, Belize, Mexico, Thailand, and India. We traveled around on public buses, trains, and stayed in ashrams or hostels. As opposite to Midwest-Yuppie Ville as one could get, while simultaneously my ex was training rigorously for the seals. This dichotomy of life was one that when we were brought back together we could never really be together. He went off with his shiny gun during the Iraqi embargo and yelled at Syrians while I continued school in Hawaii and learned about Julia Butterfly, Indigenous Peoples Rights, and Mother Jones. Things were awry in the world and people were doing things about it. And if it to wake everybody up, 9/11 hit. And what 9/11 has shown the world since then, is that, yes, there are large issues. Instead of it being a time of enlightenment and questioning through, the world erupted with black and white cynicism; i.e. Muslims against Westerners, Shop more to beat terrorism the foundation of being raised in the 1980s.

But, I believe we are finally entering a new, Age of Aquarius as the questions are arising and are coloring in the image with vibrant colors. Of course the Trumps are still major players, but more and more we are finally wanting to question and aren't ridiculed for questioning. Organic is no longer a dirty word, sex trafficking is rampant in nearly every corner of the world, and terrorism can no longer be bought off by a pair of faux-designer jeans at Walmart. We need to collectively get together and have conversations, and not be swayed by spending money we don't have on cheap $6.99 shirts at H&M during SALES ONLY TODAY that are every day andBlack_Friday_by_Powhusku only contribute to Fast Fashion degradation in the third world. And if you are on your couch, watch movies with a loved one, such as Andrew Morgans The True Cost or Lee Fulkerson's  Fork over Knives and have a conversation afterwards. I, for one, am inspired by these initiatives that give me meaning in my life. There are many things to do stand up for and now I know how to direct my energy. This folks, is what Gil Scott-Heron was singing about in The Revolution will not be Televised, There will be no pictures of pigs shooting down brothers in the instant replay, Ah, but there is now, 24/7 streaming on the internet.

But, we are on a different age and that one is a hard pull of us against them which is archaic, and the new paradigm shift of us driving the system and what we want that system to look like. The finger points back at one self and it is really not us against a maniac madman who holds all the power. Of course there is the whole 1% debate that is real, but the system underpinning this entire process should be the one that is more questioned and what our role is in this system. To not be a victim, and to start questioning what we participate in, what we consume, etc. These are really the questions and the solutions. The Gandhian adage, Be the change that you want to see in the world, is really key.

So, yes, I really did love Andrew Morgans The True Cost and I will continue to question and try to understand the parameters of my shopping consumerism, but also the systems in the world on a whole and what my part is in that. Thanks Andrew for re-instilling within me a sense of meaning, purpose, and enlightenment. Check it out on Amazon now!

As someone who grew up loving fashion, I never gave much thought as to where my clothes were coming from and what effect it would have both on the planet and to other human beings. I recently became vegan and this new lifestyle has opened a lot of doors for me, but I was just exposed to what was happening in this fashion industry a few months ago.

I wanted to remain ignorant because I loved shopping at mainstream/fast fashion stores... but as Maya Angelou said, ""once you know better you do better."" I watched it anyways and am so glad I did. Everyone needs to see this documentary. Watch it with your family, your friends, your coworkers. Educate people. This documentary changed my views. All it took was $4.00 and less than two hours for me to became knowledgable about something that's going to change my decisions in terms of fashion and lifestyle for forever.",1453852800,,1332,4.577405857740586

Ive watched a lot of environmental movies but I found it surprising how looking at just one industry, the clothing industry, can be the perfect microcosm for the unsustainability of how homo sapiens currently lives.

7207418,5,B00Y1HD3OI,"Although there are a few divergent paths that have much deeper issues, both good and bad, to explore (like their mention of Monsanto and thrift stores) the trail The True Cost - 2015 film takes is duly eye opening and does a superb job of focusing on the cost of fashion in today's world. It may not go into as much detail as possible with each path it explores, but it does go properly into detail about the message it is issuing: the true cost of fashion in the western world and it's effect on us and on their world and developing countries-the countries we ""employ"" to make our cheap, disposable fashion.

Historically we can see how our version of capitalism in the US has good, economic benefits. Yet now with America becoming more globalized our form of capitalism has created unfortunate consequences for other countries. Our market drives consts and competitive levels and regulates itself by conflicting wants of the labor force and the companies revenue. Laborers desire higher wages and better working conditions, companies desire higher revenue and smaller expenditures. This works best when workers have the power and recognition to affect companies. Yet companies over the past few decades have discovered and taken advantage of countries where workers have little to no power or recognition. They have transferred business to places where they can cut costs by a wide margin without any repercussions to the company. The stabilization between companies desires for profit and the labor force's desire for living wages has been severely altered. The power now lies with the companies and the governments they work with almost entirely.

The True Cost documentary shows us that buying into the disposable, fast fashion scene not only hurts our own lives but shows that our consumerism has directly and horrifically effected the lives of hundreds of thousands of people around the world. If it could be several hours longer it could have dived properly into several issues that stem from fast fashion, yet The True Cost still gibes us a good picture of how destructive our textile industry has become, not only to our nation, but to all nations on either hemisphere. It challenges us to stop ignoring the consequences and begin to think of new solutions to the growing problem. If not us, who? If not now, when?",1441324800,2,2324,4.9411764705882355

The film juxtapositions western consumerism and third world conditions, but not so much to drive the point as a Michael Moore film. It appears instead of buying clothes that will last we buy throw away items. The result is environmentally bad. Interesting to find out is that we also send so much donated items to Haiti, that we have ruined their local garment industry.

The film also looks at farms, seeds, pesticides, and disease in the third world due to the garment industry. It pushes ""Fair Trade""  on us. Steven Colbert has replaced Noam Chomsky for commentary, for better or worse. The Stella McCartney train interview with shadows hiding an oddly tilted head should have been shot over. During the film a Bangladesh factory worker has supposed to visit London (?) and report back to the village about their customers. I expected that to be the climax of the film with her saying something poignant, but it never happened. Too much Stella McCartney.

This was a three star production on a five star message.  Was this a commercial for ""Fair Trade?""

7207452,4,B00Y1HD3OI,"Why Watch It?
Mr. Morgan presents a meaningful documentary on the cost of fast fashion. The true cost of fast fashion as shown by ""The True Cost"" is not a shocker. In fact it's quite obvious what's happening. Apparel goods are being made in third world countries for abysmal wages and in just as abysmal working conditions. What people do not realize that fast fashion essentially magnifies the problem by making these abysmal wages and working conditions even worse (is that possible?) and to the benefit of only the corporations that contract their services. Meanwhile, consumers are being duped to purchasing inferior quality goods under the guise of feeding our superficial wants and instant gratification mentality. Fast fashion essentially is a drug.

As with most documentaries, Mr. Morgan is able to bolster his case by providing testimonials from factory workers and a (former) manager. As a result, the execution is effective but also predictable. It's neither overly sappy and sensationalistic nor gut-wrenching enough. Nevertheless, any consumer should want to know ""Why can I buy a fashionable top for $5??? That's better than what you could pay for third world produced goods in the '90s"". Everyone but these big corporations are being duped.

Why Only Four Stars?
If you are interested in the subject, you can actually do a slight bit of research and can be up to speed at less than the cost of this movie. John Oliver's ""Last Week Tonight"" show has an episode that covers the perils of fast fashion; found on Youtube and free to watch! For someone who's a bigger fashion aficionado, buy a used copy of Terry Agin's ""The End of Fashion"" for $4, used. This book is almost fifteen years old but still relevant.
