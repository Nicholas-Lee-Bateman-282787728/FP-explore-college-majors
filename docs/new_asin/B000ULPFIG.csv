2922358,4,B000ULPFIG,"This is a fun, wholesome movie, shot in Spokane, WA, that incorporates the best of two homeless kids, a very cute dog, conniving adults who are all looking for the same thing - family. There is sometimes corny but cute dialogue - and of course, a happy ending.",1209513600,6,260,4.4375
2922359,4,B000ULPFIG,"A delightful upbeat comedy which depicts how the joy of family can change a person's lifestyle. In order to gain family inheritance a con man must have a wife and children. This is the story how this con man acquires a ""famiy"" and how they change his life for the better. A must see for anyone who has enjoyed true family love.",1199145600,2,327,4.290322580645161
2922360,4,B000ULPFIG,"The Family Holiday was an amusing, lighthearted family movie.  I thought the children did a decent job; William Schultz especially stood out.  Kevin Connell made an excellent villain.  As far as TV Movies go, it was a decent one.",1198454400,,229,4.82051282051282

This film is fairly good family entertainment.  It is slow to get going, and does not have a great deal of content, but all in all a cute, clean, funny, heartwarming holiday fare.",1196467200,2,332,7.512820512820513
2922363,5,B000ULPFIG,"Thank God for Dave Coulier! Not only is this film clean, but cute and heart warming as well. Dave has an amazing comedic talent and I'm so thankful to be able to show this film around kids and not have to worry about the content. The story is fun, original and easy to follow, I enjoyed it.

A wonderful holiday treat and for $7.99, WHAT A STEAL!!!",1195344000,27,348,4.1940298507462686
2922364,4,B000ULPFIG,"I was very excited to finally see ""The Family Holiday.""  Purchasing my copy, I drove home and relaxed in front of my TV.  Being a long time fan of Dave Coulier, I was eager to see him in a more leading role, and in no way was I disappointed.  Apart from a few weak performances by minor characters, the film is very well directed and acted.  The two kids shine, leaving all of those cynics who tend to put down child actors having to recant their comments.

Christina Pickles is brilliant as Mrs. Pendergast, and Coulier shows a dramatic side that few have had the privilege to see.  Intermixed with all of Coulier's physical comedy, voices, quick-wit, and good (Clean Guy) humor, is something deeply emotional that finally has a chance to stand out.  It's a film that you can watch with your family, kids, adults, elderly, pets, or any plant you may really care about, and not be afraid of what they might hear or see.  Kids will love the physical humor, and the crafty skills of the twins.  Adults will enjoy the deeper meaning of family, and what truly matters in your life; not the material possessions, but those things that money cannot replace.

Watch it when you want something that will just make you feel good.  It will make you want to bake cookies, sit by a fire, hug your parents, and listen to your Grandparents stories.  It's a perfect movie for this time of year, time to concentrate on what is truly important: the ones you love.  I'd recommend this movie to anyone who has a heart, who can look at the lighter side of life, who has a family, and can watch a movie purely for enjoyment, not as an analysis class.  Plus, it has puppies, and who doesn't love puppies?

Please watch this film; it's made by good people with good intentions.  It's clean, funny, caring, cute, and above all the meaning of the story is something everyone should hear.  That family is a blessing everyone should have in their lives, regardless of age, background, wealth and reputation.",1195171200,67,1980,4.548022598870056
2922365,1,B000ULPFIG,"I was so much looking forward to receiving this movie from Amazon... ready to sit by the fire and Christmas tree and enjoy what claimed to be a movie about the ""true meaning of Christmas"".
 I am so disappointed, I can hardly describe how bad this movie is. I know Amazon will not return the $7.99, but I do think the writer of the movie script should refund money to everyone who buys it. It is positively the worse written script I have ever seen.
 The kids and dog were okay, but the real shame here falls on Dave Coulier, who should have known better than to be in such a bad movie. He obviously never read the scrip beforehand. Most of his lines didn't even make sense.
 There was one scene out in the snowy woods looking for a tree that I thought might save this movie, but NO LUCK --they decided not to cut down a tree!  And one scene with Santa looked a little promising--but Santa had no white beard--just looked like a drunk who had not shaved for days.
 If you are looking for a holiday movie about the true meaning of Christmas--keep looking. I gave this 1 star, because I don't think Amazon will let me give it no star for this review--but that is what it deserves----N0 Star.",1195171200,5,1188,4.285714285714286
2922366,4,B000ULPFIG,"I thought this would be like most ""cutesy"" holiday movies (especially those starring children) - corny and predictable.  Although it still was, it was quite enjoyable.  The children's roles were for the most part not too ""cutesy"" overdone, the adult roles were well acted and the serious side of Dave Coulier was great to see.  Since I couldn't give it 3 1/2 stars I gave it 4.",1195084800,22,377,4.597014925373134

She loved it. It came in a timely matter and just as discribed.",1396915200,,126,3.5357142857142856
2922370,4,B000ULPFIG,"Not one of the greatest Christmas Movies, but we still enjoyed watching it.  As fans of David Coulier, we enjoyed seeing him in TV/Film again.",1391817600,,142,4.68
2922371,4,B000ULPFIG,"While predictable in a lot of moments, still enjoyed this movie. And lots of giggles from the kids and that's what counts. Merry Christmas!",1388275200,,139,4.833333333333333
2922372,4,B000ULPFIG,"There are a lot of Christmas-themed movies out there, but finding one that is suitable for all ages is not always an easy task.  This was a surprisingly funny movie with no bad language or inappropriate material.  Dave Coulier does a great job as the lead actor and the supporting cast is very good as well.  The plot is a bit contrived at points, but still quite enjoyable.  There is a touch of spirituality but it is not an overtly Christian message, and in fact has a line that most Christians would reject (suggesting that good deeds can help one get into heaven, which is not the message of biblical religion).  All in all, a highly recommended, enjoyable film that left my family feeling happy at the end..",1388102400,2,712,4.53125
2922373,4,B000ULPFIG,Enjoyed the movie. Simple plot but one to just sit back and enjoy after a busy day of Christmas shopping.,1387238400,,105,4.3
2922374,5,B000ULPFIG,Because the ones I ordered for the DVD's are movies I saw on TV and I wanted to have DVD's of them without the commercials and also to keep so that I can see them over and over again.,1384560000,,183,3.717948717948718
2922375,4,B000ULPFIG,"I'm surprised there are people who didn't like this movie.  Even if it isn't their type of story, I can't understand why they thought it was terrible.  In my opinion, this movie was a delight to watch.  Dave Coulier (Joey from Full House) is so loveable in his role as con man Donald ""Doc"" Holiday.  His comic timing is still spot on.  Who didn't laugh during the scene where Doc was showing the new nanny to her room in a house he had never lived in before?  And how adorable were those children.  I had tears in my eyes every time the brother protected his twin sister, and the little girl's innocence and hope was so gorgeous.

This was definitely my type of Christmas movie.  It was clean, funny and had that wonderful feel-good ending which I love.  I will definitely watch this for many Christmases to come :-)",1378684800,,816,4.416107382550336
2922376,5,B000ULPFIG,"This is such an innocent, somewhat predictable, but delightful movie.  We highly recommend it to anyone.  For those people who long for the old-time values in movies, this one is for you.",1360540800,,187,4.8125
2922377,3,B000ULPFIG,"I thought this would be a good made-for-TV type movie but I was really disappointed. I kept thinking the director was holding back the actors, not giving them a chance to really get into their characters. In the end, I'll keep it in my DVD library but doubt I'll watch it very often.",1357689600,,283,4.3584905660377355
2922378,5,B000ULPFIG,"If you liked the movie Christmas Vacation, but didn't care for the bad language & sexual overtones, you will appreciate this movie. Good, clean humor showing that money isn't everything. Great for the whole family.",1354233600,3,214,5.142857142857143
2922379,5,B000ULPFIG,"""A Family Holiday"" is a fun movie with all sorts of things happening in the beginning.  The main actor, Dave Coulier handles many situations and I guess we could call him a ""total multi-tasker"".  He is going to inherit a bunch of money but in order to get this money he must have a family.

That was a bit difficult since he had no children or wife.  The Christmas movie makes one smile and even laugh out loud when it comes to making a ""real family"" from two children who had no home and no parents.  They are basically living off the streets.  So...two children have appeared for the family he needs to get all the money.  Money does make people try harder but my goodness he got it all together!

Just as the children were found somehow the wife is found as well.  If you want to watch a Christmas movie which is sometimes very funny and at times just funny but then it becomes full of love and ""you can feel the need"" to be together then this is a movie you would totally enjoy.  The money becomes less and less important.

I do love the part where Dave Coulier,  the pretend kids, the pretend mom go and the case worker all go to cut a Christmas Tree for their house in the woods.  All I can say is it did not turn out quite like they had hoped!  It's funny.

If you get the chance to watch this movie then go for it.  You and your family will enjoy it for sure!  I own it so many Christmas Movies...more than other movies.  I find super deals on Amazon and I find movies I cannot find in stores.",1331164800,2,1501,4.117241379310345
2922380,2,B000ULPFIG,"No, I didn't care for this movie.  I usually like all Christmas movies but didn't like this one at all.",1306713600,,103,4.15
2922381,5,B000ULPFIG,"This is a good family movie, which are hard to find any more. I kept you interrested clear through the movie. It could be a real life movie!",1292630400,,140,4.035714285714286
2922382,1,B000ULPFIG,"So, in general this movie wouldn't be SO bad if it didn't claim to be a movie that talks about the real meaning of Christmas. It completely feigns spirituality - claiming to be spiritual simply because they talk about God in a couple of different places. At one point the main actress tells the little girl ""Remember, sharing helps get you into heaven,"" which is the complete opposite of the true gospel message - that we are saved by faith in Christ, by grace, not by works. Anyway, I don't mind secular Christmas movies - I'm rather fond of White Christmas, Charlie Brown, and many others. I just wish that this movie had completely left out any references to God instead of trying to pander (rather poorly) to a Christian audience and in fact saying things that are completely contrary to the message of Christ and Christmas. If I could give this movie 0 stars I would.",1260576000,4,872,4.560509554140127

8213731,4,B000ULPFIG,"An enjoyable Christmas comedy movie that stars a con man who's not as good at his job as he would like to be.

  His name is Holiday and he prefers to be called ""Doc"".  He's on the run from a really nasty guy whom he owes money and that's when he runs into two lovable kids who are on the run from the government, specifically children's services, which is determined to split the two of them up and send them to different foster homes.  The boy is young, but already a little too experienced in some of the seamier things of the world, but he's determined to look out for his younger sister, who is naive, trusting, believes in Santa and everything else.  And now they have little choice:  either take up with con man Doc in a con game or get split up.

  It is not a great movie, but it is certainly a good one.  It has humor, it has a budding (maybe budding!) romance and it takes a common theme (people in trouble during the holiday season) and puts a nice little spin on it.  I enjoy watching it every year.  It usually helps me to stay in the holiday spirit.",1420848000,,1064,4.1568627450980395
