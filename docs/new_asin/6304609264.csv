How can you turn people into instruments(the only acception is Disney's Beauty and the Beast)? I suggest getting Fox's ""Anastasia"". The historical plot may be off-which it is-but it's better than this ""movie"". It doesn't even deserve a one, more like NEGATIVE one.",1006819200,4,375,4.968253968253968
909173,2,6304609264,I was at my friends house when I saw this movie. The plot isn't great. It stinks! Anastasia's family got turned into a bunch of instuments! The animation is like comics in the newspapers. It's my opinion so wacth the movie and rate this movie for yourself. The bad guys are just guys with guns who don't like her just to say.,993600000,3,325,4.258064516129032

7875616,2,6304609264,"If you're looking for a historically accurate movie you have come to the wrong place.
Anastasia had THREE SISTERS Olga Tatiana and Marie. Alexi was THE YOUNGEST not Anastasia.
The plot line was terrible. It had a few funny moments. But I couldn't make it past the half-way mark.
I suggest you rent this movie or watch it online before you buy it.
Disney's version was historically accurate without the violence.
When the Nicolas the tsar of Russia was assassinated in this movie I heard gunshots.
While in the Disney version she just missed her train.
I suggest anybody who wants a good movie about the Russian princess Anastasia should go buy the Disney version.",1388620800,,663,4.773913043478261

7875619,5,6304609264,"Of all the movies I watched as a child, this one has stuck with me!

Although I have thought of this movie several times in my adult years (which are still few in number), It has been relatively hard to find, so thanks to amazon!

While the film is low budget and obviously a children's movie, the story line is touching, the voice acting is believable, and the music is gorgeous.

While this may be no success from a critical or monetary stand point, it is definitely a film that I, and I'm sure many other children of the 1990's fondly remember.

7875620,1,6304609264,"The seller information had exceptionally high ratings, however, this item was listed as ""like new"".  When I received the movie, not only did the case look like it has been either sat on or chewed on by an animal, but the movie flickered and had a static-like bar running through the middle of the picture throughout the entire movie. Would return but it was so inexpensive it's not worth my time.",1302652800,,396,4.577464788732394
