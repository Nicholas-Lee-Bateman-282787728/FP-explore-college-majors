7934157,5,B000059TPD,"Season 1 of War Planets was great, but the second season was even more awesome.  Here's a review of the episodes, with synopsizes from Wikipedia.

14. Worlds Within Worlds:  The Beast Planet demonstrates its might, launching an armada to attack Fire while training its powerful cannons on the Battle Moons.  A stray blast threatens to destroy Ice, but Tekla and Lady Zera discover world engines hidden within the planet.  The quality of last season's finale doesn't let up.  A+

15.  This Is The Way The World Ends...:  The Beast Planet targets planet Fire.  Graveheart and Tekla must hurry to find the world engines.  One of the very best episodes of the whole show.  A+

16.  Period of Adjustment:  Emperor Femur and Pelvus must make good their commitment to return to the Alliance.  Probably the funniest episode of the whole series.  A+

17.  Blaze of Glory:  Captain Blaze and his renegade squad steal one of the Battle Moons and attempt to regain their lost honor in destroying the Beast Planet.  My least favorite of this disc, but it's still great.  A

I'm very fortunate to have this & the next 2 volumes.  If you a chance to get any of these at a good price, don't miss it.",1387843200,,1183,4.603864734299517
7934158,5,B000059TPD,"Wonderful characters, outstanding special effects, great plots and superb voice actors are just a few reasons to own this set of six great DVD's.

The story follows the adventures of the inhabitants of warring worlds that must come together to battle a common foe set on destroying them all. Honor, sacrifice and co-operation are regular themes of the series intermingled with deceit and deception.

Myself and my 7 year-old daughter really enjoy the action-packed episodes and the great character development. I have a state-of-the-art HD home theater set-up and these disks translate wonderfully to the big screen. The excellent sound quality is the icing on the cake.

Obviously, I give this series my highest recommendation.",1360368000,,728,5.3130434782608695
7934159,5,B000059TPD,"For those who have seen Shadow Raiders (or rather War Planets as it was called when it first aired) this is the DVD to savor. I guess you can call it the season finale. Here you have the new alliance finally going toe to toe with the Beast and the battles are huge. This kinda feels like Star Wars what with the giant mechanized moon and all the fighter ships fighting it out, only it's still pretty unique.

This is definitely a DVD to get if you're following the series, but I wouldn't recommend getting it if you haven't seen the previous disks. This is the disk that builds up everything you saw previously and then hits you with a few more surprises. As far as extras are concerned it's on par with the other DVD's: some brief tech files and 360 degree views of various things. No commentaries. No deleted scenes. No documentaries. Then again I wouldn't expect to get any of this anyway. This is one of those shows that got limited support so you take what you can get.",1105315200,3,974,4.351648351648351
