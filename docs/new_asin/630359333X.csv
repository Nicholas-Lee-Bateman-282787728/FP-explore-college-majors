7851784,3,630359333X,"Truth in advertising, please!  Checking out this Blu-ray cover we see the Thomanerchor Leipzig mentioned on the front, and ""Recorded Live at the St. Thomas Church in Leipzig"" mentioned not only once, but TWICE on the back.

We see the program contains not only the Bach B-Minor Mass, but also the Toccata and Fugue in D Minor on organ, a handful of other items including a Bach Motet, violin solo, some Mendelssohn, and the Beethoven 5th.  Wow!  All at the St. Thomas church!

Well, firstly it turns out the Mass in B Minor is not done by the Thomanerchor at all, but rather by the Gewandhauskammerchor.  It really is an excellent performance of the B Minor Mass, and they are a fine choir, but note, they are an adult mixed choir, not the Thomanerchor which is a boys choir.  But more on the Thomanerchor later.

Now we really get into the ""Truth in Advertising"" problems.  And you can't tell me to ""read the fine print"", because there is no ""fine print"".

ONLY the B Minor Mass is from the St. Thomas Church.  The remainder is an entirely different concert, recorded in the St. Nicholas Church.  The Bach motet, violin solo, the Toccata and Fugue in D Minor, the Mendelssohn, and the Beethoven 5th are all done in the Nikolaikirche.  Which is not a crime, but it must be said, the Mass in B Minor is available separately on DVD, and part of the reason I popped for the expensive Blu-ray is because of all these extra items.  And because I am an organist, I did really want to hear the Toccata and Fugue in D Minor from the Thomaskirche, where Bach had been Director of Music for the last 27 years of his life.

Yes, I am well aware, Bach was responsible for music not only at the Thomaskirche, but also at the Nikolaikirche.  And I am also well aware, even in the current Thomaskirche there is no organ that dates from Bach's time.  (And I am aware, Bach was not even organist per se in Leipzig at that stage of his career.)  I am aware of these issues.  But please, Damen und Herren, advertise your DVDs accurately and allow me to make my own decisions.  This is pertinent information:  the Nikolaikirche is NOT the Thomaskirche, and that's where at least half the program takes place.  That creates an element of disappointment in what otherwise would be a truly outstanding release.

Now a few observations about the music and performances,

1.  Mass in B Minor at the Thomaskirche.  Herbert Blomstedt is a truly great conductor and this is an amazing performance which needs few apologies if any, especially for a live performance.  The tempos were just right to my ears, not too fast, and not too slow.  Only in Cum Sancto Spiritu did the conductor succumb to the ever-prevalent temptation for speed, and ensemble suffered.  Other than that, wow, everything was perfect.  I especially enjoyed the interplay between the alto soloist and the violinist in Laudamus Te.  That was just one of many wonderful moments.  This Mass in B Minor is worthy of several more pages laudatory review, but will suffice for now to say it is excellent.  Sehr gut!

2.  Toccata and Fugue in D minor, at the Nikolaikirche organ.  With due respect to the organist, this was not very satisfying.  (My remarks may be tempered by the fact that it wasn't at the venue expected, as stated.)  In any event, it was NOT at a historic console (maybe as early as the 1970s, with lighted stoptabs), and it was played thru basically fortissimo from beginning to end, on the first manual, with hardly any registration change, and manual changes only where it absolutely couldn't be avoided.  Also the camera work was not very exciting, concentrating as they usually do on the pipe organ faade, occasionally zooming in on the pipe lips as if to show where all this mighty sound is coming from, ha-ha.  And the organ faade here is not very interesting.  Whether it is 1870s or 1950s I do not know, but is definitely not historic Silbermann or Schnitger or really much different than what we have on any college campus in the USA.  So, with all respect, it was not much of the ""true-Bach"" experience expected.

3.  Motet ""Furchte dich nicht"" by the Thomanerchor, in the Nikolaikirche (!)  O dear, how I do not wish to pan the Thomanerchor, but considering this was recorded in 1999, maybe those particular kids are all grown up now and would not take offense :)  There is nothing terribly wrong with the Thomanerchor, but they are simply not a world-class group such as might be expected from this mighty temple of art, the Thomaskirche ... where every Bach-lover in the world would like to make a pilgrimage at least once in his or her life.  Yes and frankly, they are not nearly as good as the ___________ (fill in the blank, insert your own favorite boyschoir, probably English, correct?)  But as I say, they are not bad, they are pleasant to listen to, but how I wish the performance could have been from the Thomaskirche where they belong.  Psychological or not, it would have made a difference.

4.  Chaconne from Partita for solo violin #2, by Viktoria Mullova, with the most excellent musicianship and technique.  This piece is supposedly unaccompanied, but in this case accompanied by a choir warming up or rehearsing somewhere in an adjacent hall.  Always a pleasant addition to any high-class concert with (no doubt) an equally high admission price.

5.  Dona Nobis Pacem, a recap from the Mass in B Minor, this time by the Thomanerchor (again, still in the Nikolaikirche).  I know, it is from a totally different concert of the full B Minor Mass reviewed above.  But appearing on the same disc, yea, even on the same SIDE of the same disc, and not nearly as good as the earlier performance--that is simply anticlimactic.

6.  A few odds and ends by Mendelssohn, which I am not familiar with, and sounded fine to me.

7.  Beethoven 5th Symphony.  This comes as a surprise, not having ever associated the Beethoven 5th with a church setting, or with a Bach concert in general, or even following a later composer such as Mendelssohn.  Well, it is one of the best darn Beethoven 5ths I have ever heard, regardless.

In summary, I do not appreciate the inaccurate advertising (and I can accept it's probably a result of inept graphic designers rather than deliberate dishonesty by the record producers, but the carelessness by those involved is deplorable, whatever the excuse) ... but in any case, overall it's a great pair of concerts.",1394323200,2,6412,4.653606411398041
7851785,4,630359333X,"I very much like the movie and music is great. I wish some company will take care and to re-master the picture quality and the sound, though it is an old film. I still I highly recommend it for movie buffs.",1387756800,,206,4.048780487804878
7851786,5,630359333X,"I consider Bach's Mass in B minor to be the finest piece of music ever written.  And this live recording (also available on CD) is excellent.  The orchestra and choir and soloists are well balanced and sound wonderful (especially the soprano, Ruth Ziesak).  These are live performances so you will hear the occasional cough during silents periods (esp between the various parts).

Watching the performance on Blu-ray makes you feel like you are there in the church watching the performance while walking in and amongst the orchestra and choir.  The video is fairly well done and edited well.  You have a chance to absorb and relish a scene before moving on.  Quick, frantic cuts...the norm in cinema today...are not to be found here.  My enjoyment of music is greatly enhanced when I am able to watch the musicians too.  And this Blu-ray delivers quality in both video and audio.

The Blu-ray video quality is good though not excellent.  The MPEG-2 encoding reveals mild compression artifacts on skin tones which leads to posterization.  I'm not sure why a more ""modern"" encoder was not used nor do I know why the video is 1080i instead of 1080p.  Nevertheless, the video is detailed with good, steady contrast and is not detracting from the overall performance.  Bit rates hover between 20-25 Mbps.

There are two audio flavors:  a 2 channel DD mix with a 320Kbps bit rate a 5.1 DTS True-HD mix with an average 4000 Kbps bit rate.  The DTS mix is well done and brings this music to life in your living room.  The surround sound mix does sound much better than the CD.

I have already watched this Blu-ray a number of times and see it as a bargain as opposed to going to the symphony.  I feel like I'm watching these performances live and in person and highly recommend this disc to any fan of of the genre.

UPDATE 8/30/13  I've watched this about 10 times since I bought it and I would upgrade the rating to six stars if I could.  I thoroughly enjoy watching this Blu-ray and the music is magnificent! Another great Blu-ray is ""Bach: St. Matthew Passion"" (ASIN: B008P76VP8).",1353456000,9,2076,4.658402203856749
7851787,5,630359333X,"For Beethoven fans this is a unique and classic addition to the collection.  Gance delivers a different portrayal of the great Maestro, occasionally happier,  and not necessarily resembling "" to a t "" Ludwig Van's facial features.  Like other Beethoven movies it touches on the "" true to life"" Immortal Beloved""  mystery etc.. but all very reasonable and acceptable.  There are very moving passages and the tears will be rolling.  Even though It is a talking picture it has the feel of a silent movie, which fits perfectly the deaf Maestros sad situation.  The first time I saw the movie it didn't grab me, maybe because I wasn't paying attention or being a modern viewer I had not acquired a taste for the atmosphere and pace of a very old flick.  The second time however ( three years later )  it ""bit me"".  Perfect casting with legendary actors of their era, Harry Baur, and a very young Jean Louis Barrault.

7851789,5,630359333X,"There are not many filmed biographies dedicated to the Music master of all times, the latest being ""Beethoven in Love"" (which is Hollywoodiana at its worst).
In Abel Gance's version, ""Un Grand Amour de Beethoven"", not only do we find some of the best French actors of an Era long gone, but we have a true effort at character study.
Like in the Austrian movie, which nowadays is practically unavailable, called ""Eroica"", another excellent example of a screen translation of the man's life, ""Un Grand Amour..."" is a fair attempt at giving us Beethoven, the man, not the lover, not just the composer, but a man in his time.
In this one, somebody may still ask himself if Beethoven's love went to women, to a particular woman, or to a simple and probably more logic choice, to his music.
But there is more. The man's interior struggles are shown.
In a time period in which Revolutionary thinking seemed to permeate society, Beethoven comes through as the German ""revolutionary"" composer he was.
Beethoven craved for human love like any other human being, but in the end, as a realist as he was, and viewed the handicap he was facing, deafness, he concentrated totally and exclusively to his music.
In this movie, one can see that struggle for love, but instead of being a defeat to Beethoven (as in the above mentioned trashy movie), the man turns it into a triumph over the senses and brings himself, as well as his own music to an apotheosis never since equaled by any other composer.
Abel Gance seems to have understood this and respecting the genius of another master of the artistic trade, delivers a very touching account of the master's life.
The only downside to this effort is the poor technology filmmakers had in those days. At times the sound is dreadful and some conversations can only be understood by reading the subtitles (mind you, I speak French fluently, but I still could not understand some passages).
The music is hauntingly beautiful, but lacks depth and roundness. Poor Abel Gance, he must have struggled hard to finance this project.
Despite all this, this is, together with ""Eroica"" (if one can find it), the only true effort made, at bringing the great master back to life.
Being a theatrical director and an actor myself, I am still hoping to be able to, one day, put together some music historians, a dignified cast and crew and start what I always wanted in my childhood: film the entire life of Ludwig van Beethoven, according to his own letter exchange and the biographies of his closest friends and admirers.
Beethoven needs and deserves a faithful reconstruction of his life, told to generations to come.
He was more than just a musical genius. He was a highly controversial historical, philosophical and revolutionary/reactionary figure.
Abel Gance's effort is just a tiny cut in Beethoven's life and by reducing it into a two hour effort, he just partially managed to expose the man behind the composer, turning it naturally, as one would expect from a master such as Gance, into a masterpiece.
And yet, it is still lacking amplitude.
Nevertheless, this movie is a must for every Beethoven fan, if not of master Abel Gance.
Let's hope to find soon a larger and better product than ""Bethoveen in love"".",1039737600,8,3233,4.785330948121646

7851791,5,630359333X,"On Abel Gance's Beethoven
I have mixed reactions about Abel Gance's Beethoven.  It was a great movie and Harry Baur's portrayal of Beethoven was impeccable, but there was too much use of Beethoven's 5th Symphony as soundtrack music.  To Gance, Beethoven seems to equal  the 5th Symphony.  This is untrue.  He wrote a lot of great music that was not used in the film.  One of the features of this film that I really liked was that it did not include any vulgar sex scenes that I found in the movie, The Immortal Beloved.  But what I consider the ultimate strengths of this movie is that it metaphorically shows the composer struggling against the disappointment of hearing that the woman he loves has fallen in love with someone else, coming to terms with his worsening deafness, and struggling against poverty by trying desperately to earn a living through his music.  Although most of the scenes are fictional, these scenes are metaphors of his existence as a human being.",996883200,2,973,4.75
7851792,5,630359333X,"""Un grand amour de Beethoven"" (1936), Directed by Abel Gance, is so full of passion, love and music -- beautiful music!  It is a lyrical biography with actors who are well cast and quite talented -- unlike the  1994 movie version ""Immortal Beloved"".
Harry Baur's acting  performance, as Beethoven, is heart felt and very strong.  Abel Gance was a  true cinematic artist, we could see that in the restored version of his  silent epic ""Napoleon"". But his movie version of the life of  Beethoven may truly be his greatest achievement, his masterpiece.
If you  love Beethoven's music and you long for movies that tell an interesting  story with passion, heart, truth and honesty (unlike most of todays  movies), I highly recommend this movie to you.
