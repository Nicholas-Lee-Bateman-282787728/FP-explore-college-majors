674706,5,6303477143,"TLJ does a superb job of both acting and directing. The entire cast is wonderful, but not enough credit is given to Elmer Kelton, a great western writer. What Sam Elliott has done with Louie L'Amour, TLJ does with Elmer Kelton. A story without diabolical killers, crazed lunatics, super heroes, terrible corporations, mass killings, ... and the other ingredients that are so common, these actors, directors, and writers have told a great story of the time of change in the west. A real story with heartache, humor, sweat, and tears, and have done it without vulgarity. Awesome!!",1031270400,83,578,4.969072164948454
674707,5,6303477143,"Tommy Lee jones like you have never seen him before.  Although very  contrasted from his roles in other movies, he is probably at his best in  this movie that he directed.  This movie will definately bring ya smiles  and laughter. Where is the DVD version?",969235200,3,256,4.6
674708,5,6303477143,"My Love for Tommy Lees Jones talent is ever on the increase.  One would have to understand that when this Super Star takes on a project, It will sparkle, and bring you too tears in all the right moments.  The national  reviews were shy to say the least concerning this great art.  Way to go  Tommy Lee.  Now concerning the story;  Huey, a good ol boy, Cowboy, Rake  and rambler, Returns home.  West Texas,after two years of seeing the  country and raising hell the way cowboys of old do.  He is not recieved by  his two loving nephews as he had anticipated.  All the reasons why are  found in perhaps one of my favorite scenes of the movie/ Eve [Francis  McDormond] and Huey [Tommy Lee] enguage in a most tender scene, in the  bitter-sweet.  Tommy Lee, Sissy Spacek, Matt Damon,Francis McDormand,Jimmy  Don Cox,Wilford Brimley,Sam Shepard, All Deliver. Other great scenes make  it all happen,  This one approaches a real old Time Tear Jerker.  Now one  of my favorites.  I rented,Now I Will Buy....",949881600,21,998,4.641618497109826

I will probably watch this one at least twenty five times (about once a month), because that's what you SHOULD do with a superior movie that tells a first class story. It is now on my list of 20 best movies ever, along with Some Like it Hot, Gone With the Wind, Groundhog Day, Streetcar Named Desire, and so on. God bless Elmer Kelton for observing the components of the story in his youth, then crafting this ""As Good As They Get"" story as a book, then to Tommy Lee Jones for adapting it to the screen.

675017,3,6303477143,"I only sorta liked this; it had wonderful period and setting details, but boy, was it heavy on dialogue.  Talk, talk, talk!  This was a made-for-TV movie from 1995 -- thus, it has cheaper production values than TV movies these days.  Also, it is an early directing and writing effort for Tommy Lee Jones -- I think it may have been his directorial debut, in fact.  So it shows less skill than his later work -- especially the amazing recent film ""The Homesman,"" which he also wrote, directed and starred in.  It is a little too neat of a ""well-made play"" package, more like a stage play despite the good visual landscape and setting shots.  It's also typical of a film in which actors are given a free hand without enough directorial guidance -- so the very talented Sissy Spacek, Frances McDormand, and Jones himself all over-act.  I guess it's worth seeing as a good historical portrait of this time and place and culture, but frankly I got pretty bored as it dragged along.",1456876800,5,976,4.574712643678161

Good Old Boys features a ""GREAT"" cast of other actors/actresses at their BEST. including Sissy Spacek and Matt Damon (Back when he  was young and actually MORE ""admirable""!), not to mention a host of others in ""character"" or ""bit"" roles, such as Wilford Brimley and numerous others.

Everything about this movie is superb and we have watched it 4 times so far since getting it about 6 months ago.  The acting by Sissy Spacek and Tommy Lee Jones (imagine) is the best, as are the performances of every other cast member.  My problem is that I can not find the soundtrack of the movie anywhere, and I have been searching everywhere for it.

Tommy Lee Jones . . . VULNERABLE?"" Watch it and see. You'll laugh HARD, you may shed a tear at the end when you hear perhaps the finest closing line of a movie since ""Frankly, my dear . . . "", and you'll enjoy a FABULOUS supporting cast, including a very young Matt Damon. Unfortunately, there are a few ""mild"" profanities that will keep you from watching this with your young children, but once you're OK with them hearing ""SOB"" shouted out loud a few times, sit back, make a big bowl of popcorn, and prepare to enjoy a wonderfully entertaining 90 minutes of beautifully produced fun!",1410220800,,753,4.424460431654676

675745,4,6303477143,"I love anything I have ever seen Tommy Lee Jones in and am always looking for good cowboy movies.  When I saw that he directed this movie and was teaming up again with Sissy Spacek (they were teamed up in Coal Miner's Daughter) I just couldn't resist.  It is a fun movie:  The story of a crusty old cowhand that is a relic of the old days on the range who doesn't quite fit in anymore, yet, his old cowboy charm and ways are the very thing people love about him.  This same idea has been done before, even with John Wayne in movies like Big Jake.  But this movie is charming and about a Good Ole Boy, who doesn't really understand why he's in trouble for punching out a sheriff, and whose wandering ways constantly upset his family because of his cowboy tendency to just be gone for years without contact.  Yet it's his very cowboy ways that come to the rescue of the family when they need it and his cowboy ways that seems to charm everyone around him.  It's a fun movie.  I didn't give it 5 stars only because it is not on the caliber of his very best movies in terms of being a riveting story or a nail biter, but it really is a good movie and a great story about the end of an era.  Also there are some great performances in there by Matt Damon, Sam Shepherd, Walter Brimley and others.",1407974400,3,1290,4.14859437751004

Standing out is the performance of the local sheriff, good guy and friend to Tommy Jones's character, who in real life is a Texas Ranger - one of the best (Joachim Jackson).

676111,4,6303477143,"It's a mystery why this movie is not being produce on DVD from the studio. This unappreciated story is a very engaging yet subtle movie centered on the characters. Not a superficial glamorization of mythical western American violence so prevalent in this genre.  Tommy Lee and Sam Shepherd are simply great. This perhaps Tommy Lee's best character next to his performance as Woodrow McCall from Lonesome dove. Frances McDormand is fantastic as usual and almost steals every scene she's in. The supporting cast is quality and solid. As a ""made for TV"" movie it is a much better story, dialogue and cinematography than you would expect.
I would say this accompanies a small group of movies true to authentic ""Cowboy-ism'.
Matt Damon is dead weight as usual but even he can not drag this gem down.
Looking for rollicking bar fights, street shootouts, bank heists, daring escapes and charging posse? Go somewhere else friends. There are a few scenes the boys have a little frolic, but the story does not center around those escapades.
Want a enjoyable, clean, character driven story about the value of independence and freedom vs family and responsibility. The ""what & how's"" a cowboy thinks and what his morals are and his motivations. Always doing this with a lot of good humor? Never boring! check this out.

676200,5,6303477143,"This is a classic film and for me the best aspect is that it is culturally and historically accurate. Tommie Lee Jones, a Texas native and one of the greatest actors of our time, gives a superb performance as Hughie Callaway. Frances McDormand as his sister-in-law is tremendous and actually intimidates me as I watch the movie. The entire cast is great. I am an amateur historian and I highly appreciate films that puts forth the effort to be historically accurate especially when it comes to the styles of dress, choice of weapons, and the manner of speech of the characters. Gold Old Boys is true to all of these things and more. The sellers service was great and I was able to copy the VHS onto DVD for my personal library.",1288310400,,727,4.515151515151516

The person I bought it for said it's the best movie ever but he also thinks the show ""Reba"" is the best on TV.  You will just have to watch it yourself to form an opinion.

Historically accurate and true to life characters reveals a good understanding of the turn of a century settling of the West.

676285,1,6303477143,"On the strength of the consistent rave reviews here of this Tommy Lee Jones project - he co-wrote, directed, and starred in the film - we got this over-priced video. Talk about the sensation of being from another planet! We were amazed to discover that the movie is truly awful (read: AWFUL). Jones was clearly worshipping at his own altar, with incessant lingering close-ups of his grinning face. Like Costner's self-glorifying DANCES WITH WOLVES, THE GOOD OLD BOYS rarely sports a single frame which does not showcase Jones. Neither star is sufficiently talented as an actor or as a director to carry an entire film, yet both are compelled to take their places on both sides of the camera. When Jones isn't chewing the scenery with those all-too-exposed teeth (the man literally never closes his lips from start to finish), he is directing the wasted Spacek in a thankless role as a frustrated spinster. More offensive than Spacek's painfully over-the-top girlishness is the notion that ANY woman - frustrated or otherwise - would pursue an unbathed, aging, penniless, dim-witted drifter whose ludicrously exaggerated accent could scrape paint off a fender.",1199404800,4,1159,5.105263157894737
676286,5,6303477143,"I actually bought this for my husband to read, but found I enjoyed it almost as much as he did.  He (my husband) is a great fan of good westerns, and liked this book so well, he had me order the vhs tape of the same name.",1186790400,2,221,3.702127659574468
676287,4,6303477143,"Who could resist a movie that opens with a salty old cowpoke complaining to his horse named Biscuit that he's weary of ""cow-ology""? That short monologue sets the tone for a film that is much like its main character: simple and appealing. Having grown up in West Texas, I can recall characters exactly like those portrayed by Tommy Lee Jones and Sam Shepherd. It's apparent that GOOD OLD BOYS was directed (by Jones) with genuine affection for the material. Jones, along with Sam Shepherd and Sissy Spacek are wonderful. But the supporting players are just as great, including a youngster by the name of Matt Damon.

UPDATE / DVD Review: Still deserves four stars for being a great flick but I've reduced the rating down to three stars because the DVD transfer of this fine film is deeply disappointing. The folks at the Archive Collection have dropped the ball. The image quality transfer it isn't much of an improvement over the old VHS version. Guess we'll have to hope for a Blu-ray release.",1175040000,22,994,4.745664739884393

676291,5,6303477143,"Tommy Lee Jones brings the Elmer Kelton western classic to life with THE GOOD OLD BOYS. Like Monte Walsh, the story follows a tried and true cowboy's nostalgic efforts to hold on to the only life he knows. Even being roped down in order to help his brother keep his homestead and an appealing lady friend aren't enough to make Huey Calloway (Jones) settle down.

A wonderful movie, THE GOOD OLD BOYS features terrific performances by Jones, Sissy Spacek, Francis McDormand, Sam Shepard, Wilford Brimley and Matt Damon. A cameo performance by Larry Mahan, one of the greatest rodeo cowboys ever, adds some wonderful spice and authenticity,

As Jones rides off into the sunset, like Tom Selleck in Monte Walsh, the hope and the dream that cowboys will continue to ride is very artfully expressed.

Where in the heck is the DVD for this one?

Takes place in West Texas at the turn of the century when cars and lights were just showing up in towns.  A long time cowboy marvels at these innovations.  It is also a picture of life there at that time, which was hard and not for the weak.  A great movie with Tommie Lee Jones acting and writing much of it.",1523836800,,431,3.8636363636363638
