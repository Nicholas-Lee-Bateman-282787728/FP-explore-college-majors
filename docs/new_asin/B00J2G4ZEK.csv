6316213,5,B00J2G4ZEK,Beautiful job telling the story of those who have not had a voice before now. This documentary did a fantastic job depicting the plight of the less fortunate and especially women in India. I thought it brilliantly walked the line of telling a poignant story and being informational without crossing into emotionally ravaging the viewer. Veil of Tears was one of the best documentaries I have seen in a long time.,1405296000,,412,4.816901408450704
6316214,5,B00J2G4ZEK,"Narrated by Natalie Grant, Veil of Tears tells the untold story of millions of women in India who are culturally oppressed simply because they are women. Their value is only in their ability to produce sons and to provide for the needs of their men. Once her husband dies (which is ALWAYS the fault of the wife), the widow has no value. This film was shot on-location across various regions of India spanning from the majesty of the Taj Mahal to remote tribal villages to some of the worst slums imaginable.

This documentary, produced and directed by Kenny and Kyle Saylors, gives a glimpse of the heart-breaking tragedy that these women face, but also shows the resilience and ability to survive the persecution, rejection, and poverty they face daily.

The film brings an overall view of darker side of life, but also shares the stories of a few women to personalize the anguish they face. But, there is Hope and the film leads to ways that millions of women are now receiving hope through the efforts of Dr. KP Yohannan and Gospel For Asia. Their Bridge of Hope program cares for tens of thousands of children, helping them break out of the generational curses of poverty and hopelessness. Women minister to women to teach them a skill to be used to support themselves and their families, and to teach them their value to Jesus Christ.

The film starts out with a colorful, fairy tale type story about the Taj Mahal and the love and honor Shah Jahan had for his 3rd wife, Mumtaz Mahal. But the storybook quickly changes to the stark reality of the plight of many Indian women today. Instead of being cherished by their husbands, we learn of the despair. The Saylor Brothers skillfully pull you into the the stories of these women.

The cinematography is outstanding, and I love the way the story moves from various regions of India, clearly demonstrating that this dehumanizing of females is not merely a few isolated instances. The viewer is moved by the despair these women and their children face daily, but we are led to the hope that can be found. Follow-ups on some of the stories that were so heart-wrenching are now colorful and joyous as these women have learned that they are loved and that there are people who are willing to help. The colorful saris and beautiful smiles the women are wearing by the end as they work and worship together is a joy to behold.

Erica Lane's music was another favorite part, and the songs stayed with me long after the credits had ended. You will also want to check out the Special Features section to find out more behind-the-scenes stuff and a couple of more stories. Obviously, this is not a film made to entertain, but it is one you will want to share with others. Perhaps you will be led to find a way to help other women and children realize the hope these women now have.

Proceeds of this film will be donated toward continued efforts to change lives on a social, educational, health and spiritual level. Take a moment to learn more about the mission of GFA and how you can be a part of our movement to rescue generations of women from persecution and rejection and into the hope of Jesus Christ.

6316215,5,B00J2G4ZEK,"A remarkable documentary on the current cultural persecution of millions of women in India simply because they are females!
Shot entirely on location, this is a movie which will move you like no other, not because of its heartbreaks but rather because of the hope it displays throughout!

Veil of Tears runs 90 minutes, is narrated by Natalie Grant and brings you an incredible outlook on the lot of women in today's India.
With its rich history, its elite technology and military power, its millionaires and extensive slums, India is truly a country of paradox.

India has been the subject of media criticism lately because women have little if any rights in its society. To understand however what can be done to help, this in depth documentary explains the many cultural challenges which must be met before those changes can be accomplished.

One man in particular has made his life task to make such changes by sharing his love for Christ with those who very much need to be loved themselves!
K.P. Yohannan works in cooperation with Bridge of Hope to train women, often survivors themselves, to reach out to others like them, no matter which class they belong to, to know they are children of God and their lives matters.

Together they bring hope to countless survivors of this adverse culture which has claimed lives for centuries through starvation, needless abortions, suicides and abuse at the hands of society, sometime even their own families.
Food, medical supplies and most of all, the idea that women of all castes are to be valued and respected, not treated as slaves is taught at the lowest level.

The victims' cry for help needs to be heard and a measure of freedom from such oppression can only be met if they have access to the information and support provided by such as K.P. Yohannan and his Sisters of Compassion.

A truer resilient spirit would be hard to find anywhere else than in the many Indian slums and remote tribal villages featured in this movie.

Witness in His name by learning how bringing these women spiritual and moral support can make a difference. Knowledge is power after all and that's what the message is about it! So much can be accomplished with so little!
An excellent resource for homeschooling, church and youth groups and particularly women's groups!

5 Stars for its message of hope!

8647406,5,B00J2G4ZEK,"Legends or myths are stories which have an element of truth. They often recount a version of historical events. Sometimes the distance between that fiction and the truth is so vast that its an enormous gulf. To illustrate such a point, this documentary begins by relating, in grand fairy tale fashion, the story of the building of the Taj Mahal. Legend has it that the Taj Mahal was built by emperor Shah Jahan as a tribute to his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died giving birth to their 14th child. This romanticized tale of a king who was so stricken with grief that he erected an extravagant monument and memorial for his princess lies in stark contrast to the reality of life in present day India.

Despite Mahatma Gandhis tireless efforts to break the yoke of Britains colonial rule and secure freedom for India, and though it is the worlds largest democracy, Indias people are far from free. And of those people, women suffer under the most egregious forms of oppression and abuse.

Indias culture is based on an ancient caste system wherein birth (family name) determines ones status and place in the world. From birth to death, ones fate is unchangeable and inescapable. Indias religion helps support and perpetuate this belief; the people develop a fatalistic view which offers no chance, or hope, for change in this lifetime.

For the vast majorities living in rural villages and slums, to be female is to be unwanted. Women cannot earn money so they are not valuable to their families. On the flip side, due to a still actively practiced dowry system (which legislation supposedly outlawed in 1961), a girl is a tremendous burden to her family. A desperate poverty causes families to abort, kill, or abuse their daughters, or to sell them into prostitution.

Though Bollywood and Hollywood tend to glamorize Indian culture and Indian weddings, for millions of Indian women their wedding is no fairy tale of happily ever after. Many children are married off as soon as they experience their first menstrual period. Culturally, it is tolerated for a husband to abuse his wife, as she is no more than property to him. Should she give birth to a girl, he may ask her not to feed the child or to kill it. Should the family not approve the marriage, or wish to escape the shame of a poor connection, they may poison, immolate, or otherwise murder her. Should her husband have debts, he may prostitute her by sending her to the house of another man. She is denied education and likely is illiterate. And should her husband die before she does, his death will provide no relief. Even if she had nothing to do with it, she will be blamed for his death, ostracized, and left penniless and homeless to fend for herself with no assistance and no friends. Left to die.

Rape and suicide are rampant. And rape goes largely unreported due to the accompanying cultural shame. If it should be known that a woman was raped, how could she secure a husband? Rape has become such an epidemic that its happening during daylight in the urban areas, even on public transportation.

The heartbreaking first half of this film presents these harsh realities through personal anecdotes. The virtual tour through the different regions of India lets you see first hand how these people live. You see into all the overlooked, forgotten places. Places from which Indian society turns a blind eye. Places that should only exist in nightmares and horror stories, but which are altogether too real. Lands dominated by mud and dirt with people living in cardboard, with tin or plastic roofs, washing their clothes and themselves in the same water used by livestock.

The second half of the film offers some hope by showing organizations and groups of people on the ground, spreading Gods message and Gods love. These people  primarily widows, orphans, desperate women who sold their children, or women who were abused, raped, or themselves sold, find a place where they are welcomed. Where they are loved, perhaps for the first time. And many of these people, largely women, are trained to go out and reach others. In largely segregated areas, these women may be the only ones able to reach other women in need.

Though these organizations and people have limited resources, and though the immensity of the problem cannot be easily overcome, important inroads are being made. Families are able to feed their children, health education is given, and wells provided so that people can wash properly. Skills like sewing and basket weaving are taught to women, by women, so that they can take care of themselves. Children are taught reading and math. Literacy efforts are in place to teach adults to read as well. Minds and lifeways are being changed. It will take much time, money, and continued effort, but hopefully the movement will grow and the lives of future girls and women will be improved.

Verdict: 4.5 of 5 Hearts. Eye-Opening, Heartbreaking Documentary. Veil of Tears opens viewers eyes while shinning a spotlight into the dark, unspoken places of Indian society. I urge you, even if you do not buy or view this film, to educate yourself on the plight of Indian women (and Asian women at-large). And once your eyes are opened, please look into your heart and find a way to help enact change.

8647408,4,B00J2G4ZEK,"Veil of Tears is quite a DVD. It tells about the life cycle of women in different parts of India/Asia. How very horrible the things they have to go through. In Asia women aren't treated like human, but more like animals. Having a female child is the worse thing that can happen, or not having enough money to pay the man to marry a woman.  Another really sad thing is young girls are made to marry at a very early age, they are slaves and if they become a widow they are cast out from everyone and everything they know. The woman is considered bad luck if her husband dies and its like her fault.
  What {besides all of the above} I found very disturbing is that an alarming amount of women commit suicide. Many, many women are made to get abortions if they know they are having a girl. In these countries about  of the people are male. They kill off all of the girl babies.
  There is a group of people called Gospel for Asia and also Bridge of Hope who are trying to help these women to have something to hope for and part of that is reaching the men and teaching them the gospel. They learn that God loves the women and wants the men to treat them as human and love them. Some of the girls and women haven't felt love until they come to these churches.
  My feelings on this DVD is that it really opens your eyes and makes you want to help. I also wish that in the DVD they would have spent a longer time talking about the good that is coming from these organizations and the hope that they have. Over  of the DVD talks on the bad and ugly lives these women have to endure.
  This DVD is a really good way to show your church or group about what needs to be done and how we can do it. I recommend it.
