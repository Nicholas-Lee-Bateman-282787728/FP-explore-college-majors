2220615,5,B0007N1JDM,"Travor Romain: Bullies Are a Pain in the Brain, is a great video.  My 7-year old really loved to watch it, and has watched it several times.  Like all Travor Romain videos, it gets the key points across, provides useful information, while entertaining both young and old.  After mentioning how much we enjoyed it, our Libraian went out and purchased a copy, too!",1301529600,,362,4.714285714285714
2220616,5,B0007N1JDM,Great DVD to educate young children on ways not to bully their peers. I would highly recommend this DVD.,1288051200,,104,4.526315789473684
2220617,5,B0007N1JDM,"This is a well made video for kids of all ages.  Even younger children will have no trouble comprehending the concepts it tries to teach.  My children are 4 and 7 and they had no trouble fully understanding it.  The video held their interest and helped open up a dialogue regarding bullying.

The video explains the tactics that bullies use to intimidate their victims.  The main character demonstrates what children often do when bullied, some common misconceptions and what tactics are most successful.

I found the video to be very informative, even for myself, and would recommend it to all parents of young children.",1233792000,9,621,4.923076923076923
2220618,5,B0007N1JDM,"My 9 year old son totally enjoys all of the Trevor Romain products.  We have borrowed his books from our library and DVD's from Netflix.  Now we are building our own collection.  We were introduced to Trevor Romain while researaching books on stress and anxiety to help my son deal with difficult situations.  My only negative comment is... since the dvd's were sold through a vendor and not amazon, I had to pay shipping on each dvd instead of one shipping charge for all three dvd's purchased",1232150400,8,494,4.64367816091954

2220620,5,B0007N1JDM,"I can really appreciate how candid this video is.  It's hard to watch this child being bullied but, I love the end result.

2220622,4,B0007N1JDM,This video is a great ice-breaker for kids and adults.  The show provides excellent methods for showing kids how to deal with bullies.  The one thing we must remember is that bullies can be anywhere not just at school.  While this story is set at school the points that are made can apply to bullies universally.,1111363200,10,312,4.535714285714286

8049142,5,B0007N1JDM,"This is a great video and the kids love it. I like to write the strategies on the board while the class is watching. By the end, you have a finite list of strategies to share. Very practical and engaging!",1379894400,,204,4.125
8049143,4,B0007N1JDM,Outlines in a step-by-step 'cool' process. The best part of this DVD presentation on how to bully-proof yourself is the 'twist' ending.,1361232000,,135,5.181818181818182
8049144,4,B0007N1JDM,"This video is well made and funny, but also has a serious theme with helpful messages.

8049145,5,B0007N1JDM,I ordered this DVD from the library and plan to purchase.  This DVD is fun to watch with family or a child that has been bullied at school.  My daughter is in elementary school and has been bullied with a girl in her class.  This book shows children how bad bullying is and how bad it really hurts.  It teaches children different ways to deal with bullies.  I recommend this book to any parent that has children in elementary school.,1333324800,,433,4.3625
8049146,5,B0007N1JDM,"My daughter, who is almost ten, loved all three of the Trevor Romain videos that I ordered.  We watched them all in one night.  They are well done.  Fun.  The music is hip.  I highly recommend.",1329264000,,193,4.25
8049147,1,B0007N1JDM,"I purchased this DVD after reading reviews on Amazon. I previewed it at home before I played it for the children I work with. It was fine and even therapeutic until it showed someone picking their nose and holding a booger in front of a bully's face as the ""wrong way"" to deal with a bully. With that, it became useless. Returned DVD next day.",1309910400,,343,4.292307692307692
8049148,5,B0007N1JDM,"This video is a great way to teach kids about what constitutes a bully and how to deal with bullies.  It is light-hearted and funny, like all of Trevor Romain's videos.  I am an elementary school counselor and show this video to my 3rd-5th grade students and they love it!",1305763200,,272,4.42
