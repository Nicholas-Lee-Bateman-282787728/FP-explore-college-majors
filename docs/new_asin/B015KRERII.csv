7442611,5,B015KRERII,"I considered it an excellent program, especially in its emphasis on William Bradford and his account of the Plimoth Plantation. I suspect that it would be pretty long, dry and uninteresting to a viewer who is not as knowledgable and interested in this area of American history as my wife and I are.",1453334400,,298,4.6415094339622645
7442612,5,B015KRERII,"Starts with: ""Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. . . . These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. . . . But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city."" Hebrews 11;13-16

This is the proper start in presenting the pilgrims. Their deep religious faith, drawn from years of diligent Bible study, drove their decisions. Ignoring this faith would hide the real motives of this small group. Therefore, the video starts by briefly explaining the 'separatist' movement. They wanted to separate from the false, corrupt, anti-Christian England of James. They did, first by traveling to Holland and then America.

Video reenacts life on the Mayflower (horrible), the first winter (terrible), when half the people died. Relations with natives, each other and finally the Puritan's who settled Boston. Beaver pelts went up in price, so they received help.

Nevertheless, the main focus is William Bradfrod, since his journal is the basis of this story. Governor for 37 years. He wrote a history for his children that has been found and published. Not only did he write history, but a few short poems, that are read with real feeling! This emotional sketch adds color.

I did not know that Bradford studied Hebrew so he could read the Bible in the original. Shows his hand written exercises of Hebrew letters with the English translation. Bradford wrote that he wanted to read the inspired word, in Hebrew, to come closer to God. Video concludes with a reading of Bradford's expression of faith and praise to Jehovah, his God. Facinating!

This presentation clears up misinformation. Adds new information. The reenactment of many situations brings story to life. The expert commentary, by several scholars, adds detail. Well done and enjoyable.

7442613,1,B015KRERII,This is a terrible documentary using 21st century values to criticize 16th and 17th thinking.  There are many conclusions drawn which devaluate the American experience and the sacrifices made by the Pilgrims which led to the Greatness of our Country and many outstanding constitutional principles such as freedom of religion.,1452297600,14,325,5.5

7442616,4,B015KRERII,"4 1/2 STARS --- LIGHT, SHORT, AND DRAMATICALLY POLISHED

THIS IS NOT JUST THE STORY OF THE PLYMOUTH SETTLEMENT OR THE FIRST THANKSGIVING  --- THE LARGEST FOCUS HERE IS A SUPERFICIAL EXPLAINATION OF HOW A SMALL GROUP OF PURITANS BECAME THE EMBODIMENT OF NATIONAL IDENTITY OR FOUNDING, THANKS IN LARGE PART TO THE SURVIVAL OF THE WRITINGS OF WILLIAM BRADFORD

Though this documentary does tell the story of the Puritans who came on the Mayflower, that is not necessarily the main takeaway.  Though it does tell the story of a small group of religious separatists who fled England for the Netherlands and ultimately in a poorly planed voyage to the new world at the wrong time of year, then their struggle for survival at Plymouth --- this is not a simple retelling of another documentary in a prettier package.  Yes, with just around 2 hours it is somewhat superficial and all the historical connections are not well established or applied.  But they are researched and documentation is referenced.  Beyond the basic story, here is what you can really consider:  This documentary explains that though important, this first group of Puritans were a small group with a particular experience that could have been somewhat obscured if not for the survival of William Bradford's writings in ""Of Plymouth Plantation"".  That is the real meat of this documentary.  How did this small group of very particular people come to embody the entire American founding experience?  How did the nearly lost manuscript ""Of Plymouth Plantation"" survive the War for Independence, travel to England, surface later, come back to the U.S., and create the Pilgrim fascination for a then much larger country about to enter the Civil War?  These are the things that really made this short program interesting to me.

This very polished documentary takes the path of partial entertainment in an attempt to appeal to a wider audience than just history enthusiasts.  It is very polished with an actor playing William Bradford recounting quotes in a very dramatic and even reverential way.  His prose is beautiful and enlightening.  But while giving William Bradford tremendous credit as a leader, writer, and historian for his endeavor, this program also acknowledges that he had a very specific viewpoint and that history should have more than one viewpoint to be more accurate.  Other accounts are included from among the pilgrims, court documents, and from native American historians.  Again, the program is short so the tie ins are not perfect.  But hearing more about the hardship and fear within the settlement was interesting.  If you are looking for a program recounting the pageantry of the first Thanksgiving, this may not be exactly what you expected.  If you are looking for a strict recounting of only Bradford's history, you may be disappointed.  But the brief recounting of how this story became embodied in our national mythology (I don't use that term in a derogatory way), is profound and fascinating.  The connection to the Civil War period, the return of Bradfords manuscript to the US, and Abraham Lincloln establishing it as a national remembrance is important for Americans to understand.

For those who think I am being too generous, here are my minor criticisms which I also think should be mostly overlooked due to the run time and point of the program:  I already said the historical tie ins are not perfect.  By that I don't mean they are inaccurate.  I mean they are not perfectly established because they don't have the time to do get into the minutia.  Sometimes details feel like they are applied broadly when we don't know how much they were a part.  For instance, we hear that Bradford recounts burying the dead at night to hide their attrition from the native Americans.  A later court document is sighted mentioning that they actually placed some sick or dead out on the perimeter with guns to make it appear they had more guards.  I am sure both accounts are based in truth.  But the show doesn't make any effort to dispel the impression that maybe MOST of the dying or dead were taken to the woods and placed as strawmen guards.  The fact is we don't know how much they did that.  But Bradford appears reluctant to disclose that fact.  The real point of that story is that in reality the settlement was more afraid for their survival than we originally knew.  The terror of that first winter was palpable.  That to me is a fair point.

Take the dramatic readings for the poetry they are.  Take the short program with a grain of salt knowing there is always more.  Use this terrific program as an introduction to explore a much greater topic than can be explained in 2 hours.  Some people seem to be taking this program as a knock on William Bradford's account.  That is absolutely not the case.  The whole point is to express how important the survival of Bradford's manuscript was to this story surviving as much as it did.",1448668800,10,4930,4.839904420549582
7442617,5,B015KRERII,"THE film to see if you want to understand the Pilgrim's experience.  Beautiful cinematography.  Roger Rees extraordinary.
The script is clear and beautifully written and read by Oliver Platt.",1448582400,,191,5.551724137931035
7442618,4,B015KRERII,"Don't let quibbles get in the way of enjoying this. No treatment of a topic as complex as this can cover everything--there simply must be factual omissions. What the filmmakers chose to cover won't necessarily be what you or I would choose. On the main, most important details, this film does quite well. Nor are all these criticisms factually justified: for instance, the film clearly does mention warfare between the native tribes--I recall that point being made quite clearly, and I only viewed it once. And while there might have been a few ships that reached the colony between resupply runs, there almost certainly were not casual visitors to Plymouth in the middle of the winter...which was the time they most would have needed such visits. Effectively, the colonists WERE on their own. Nor does it matter much whether it was or wasn't possible to physically see the sand hills of Cape Cod from the colony. That was clearly a figurative statement, meant to convey how close those places were, relatively speaking. Whether or not you can see the Cape Cod with the unaided eye is just quibbling.

Meanwhile, Burns covers aspects of this story that would never occur to most people. For instance, the emotional health of the colonists--depression, in modern terms--would have been affected by physical diseases like scurvy. This is despite the cliche that deeply religious people are somehow resistant to these mood disorders. One of the things the film does well is communicate the feeling of being truly isolated, on of the other side off an ocean from everyone and everything you know.

This is a moving, beautifully realized meditation on a subject we all think we understand, but really don't. No documentary is beyond criticism, but quibbles shouldn't prevent anyone from enjoying it.",1448582400,29,1794,5.016778523489933
7442619,5,B015KRERII,"A poetic and illuminating look at the pilgrims. I was not familiar with William Bradford or his writings and found his account, set against the brutality and grim reality the history, fascinating. Roger Rees' performance in particular was a highlight. Another amazing episode of American Experience and film by Ric Burns.",1448409600,5,321,5.313725490196078
7442620,3,B015KRERII,"Most viewers of ""The Pilgrims"" will not have read ""Of Plymouth Plantation"" by William Bradford.  Yet the film presents its speakers as the world's experts on the book, a first-hand account of Pilgrim history.  However, I read the book completely over ten years ago, and I can say there is a lot more to the Pilgrims and the world of the 1600s than the views expressed in this film.

By this I mean there are factual gaps in the film, which is partly expected with the transition of a book to film, especially when a novel is made into an entertainment film.  But for gaps to appear in the dramatization of a history book is less common.  For example, the Civil War series by Ric Burns was very detailed, but also very long.  Most statements in the Civil War were actual historical quotes from contemporaneous writing.  Here, it's the opposite:  most statements are present day viewpoints with a speckling of 1600s written passages (even though Bradford's book is lengthy and highly detailed).  Let's just say that either ""The Pilgrims"" needed to be a four-hour, two part film, or a much more carefully edited two-hour film.

Here are some of the factual gaps, and some contradictory statements in the film:  1st the Pilgrims overcame great odds, lost about half of their people in the first winter, yet founded the world's most successful democracy.  Then, in a contradictory tone, the speakers proceed to belittle this success by claiming that the Pilgrims mishandled the ill and dying people, and then in later decades that Bradford was disappointed to see families move away and found new towns.  This is an example of importing late 20th / early 21st century views into the 1600s, or more likely, simple speculation.  When one actually reads William Bradford, the events are more plain and stark.  It was a matter of survival, people were starving and cold, they held on through determination and hope.

Since ""American Experience"" reaches so many viewers I'll provide some more corrections.  The narrator suggests also that when the Mayflower left Plymouth in 1621 that the Pilgrims were now completely on their own (that is a paraphrased statement or quote).  Then a few minutes later we hear that a relief ship ""The Fortune"" arrives with supplies and people, sent by the merchant Thomas Weston.  In Bradford's book, there are numerous English trading and passenger ships crossing the Atlantic and visiting the colony.  So, the show's statement is not factually accurate, yet one hopes to take the show at its word.  While the Pilgrims were more alone in the world than just about any person living in an industrialized country today could expect, they were not going to be completely on their own.  This is a popular school history image, one which I also believed until I read ""Of Plymouth Plantation"".

Further on, the film takes a turn and questions whether Native Americans or Pilgrims, or both, sometimes act harshly in the struggle for survival.  History shows that both groups, and other groups like the Narragansetts, were capable of waging war.  As it turns out, the film recounts the Pilgrim and Wampanoag treaty but breezes over the key reason for this:  years of attacks by the Narragansetts on the Wampanoags, and the vulnerability of the low population of the Wampanoags.  This was simply missed in the film.  Since it is historically prominent and clearly described by Bradford, its omission is careless.

As for the growth of the colony in the mid-1600s, it's not clear if Bradford's personal disappointment mattered a great deal or whether that is an isolated quotation blown out of proportion.  The Pilgrims and their descendants chose to move and found new homesteads, often with tens or hundreds of acres per family, an amount of land in England reserved only for the nobility.  One expects that they were happy to have new farms and provide for their large families of eight or more children.  What's overlooked in this part of the show is that towns in the area often had multiple Pilgrim families moving to each, not completely separating as it would appear from the tone of the film).  So it wasn't a disintegration of a community but an expansion, with each new town typically having multiple Pilgrim families, and each town replicating certain key aspects of Plymouth, like a nascent separation of church and state, English laws, customs, and so forth.

At other times the film seems to bring in provocative statements just because they are provocative or seemingly new.  While the 1600s word ""feast"" appears in the very written record shown on the TV screen during discussion of Thanksgiving, a speaker then says Thanksgiving is not really from the Pilgrims, but that when it happened it was a matter of large meals and people getting together.  This simply leaves out the European history of feast days, which were often tied to religion.  What is humorous here is that the commentator says that Thanksgiving is simply a big meal and a get together.  A lot of people could be nodding their heads on this one because, yes, that is what Thanksgiving is for the Average Joe.  So the commentator may be right about some percentage of Americans today but she spoke with no depth or detail about the feast days on the English calendar of the 1600s or in Europe.

Then other times the film uses poetic language to claim a point, but results in a factual error.  Late in the show, when Bradford passed away, the narrators says Bradford was laid to rest on Burial Hill ""within sight of the sand hills of Cape Cod"" (a paraphrased statement).  This apparently is an attempt to tie in Bradford's burial with the overly long discussions of them meanings of Pilgrim and Indian burials, and claims of mishandling artifacts in the sand hills near Provincetown.  The problem with this statement, about being able to see the sand hills on Cape Cod from Burial Hill in Plymouth is that you can't do it.  It's physically impossible to do what the film claims, with the unaided eye.  So maybe the editors visited the area, saw the Manomet hills nearby, but somehow didn't realize that the hills are part of Plymouth.  Again, since they decided to edit the film this way and then broadcast it nationally, the details need to be right.

Returning to the beginning of the show, I would say it has good quality when covering the origins of the Pilgrims in England and their development into a cohesive group in The Netherlands, but wavers and begins to contradict itself when the Pilgrims arrive in America.  Somehow the film has mixed feelings about how the Pilgrims recovered from their severe losses during first winter, began to grow into a prosperous colony, and set the foundations for the world's most successful democracy.",1448323200,17,6740,4.845414847161572
7442621,2,B015KRERII,"The primary reason for my dislike of this movie is due to three factors, 1. The casting director who cast Rodger Rees, 2. The director Ric Burns for not directing  Rodger Rees to spit the rocks out of his mouth, stop mumbling, and to speak up so normal humans can hear and understand just what the monotone gibberish coming out of his mouth is trying to communicate, 3. Rodger Rees's monotone voice and his inability to speak a language that comes close to what we understand as the English language. If Rodger Rees speaks as he does in this film he has most likely been punched in the face multiple times at parties while he was in collage.

By the time I reached the 1 hour mark of this movie nothing would have pleased me more than to murder Rodger Rees. Rodger Rees's low talking and monotone mumbling and Ric Burns failure to direct made me hate this movie and this story. Clearly Ric Burns is attempting to remove himself from the shadow of his brother but this was a failure in my mind. From Ric Burns's inability to understand that the audience must to be able to understand the utterances of his actors or make closed caption a mandatory part of the film whenever Rees speaks to Burns's choice in musical score that left me wanting to put a pistol in my mouth and then pull the trigger. The only emotion I was left with after viewing this film was anger that I had wasted two hours of my life.

7442623,3,B015KRERII,"This documentary was well done, but terribly lacking. I realize that modern attitudes do not embrace religion, but this was a primarily religious community and there was no point in the documentary where this aspect was even mentioned. Their religious services were called ""meetings"" and the earliest laws of the Colony reflected their strong beliefs. There was absolutely no tolerance for other religious ideas, as in regards to the banishment of Lyford, the ousting persons of puritan and shaker beliefs. Elder William Brewster, religious leader, eldest statesman and father figure to William Bradford was not mentioned at all. The film series ""Saints and Strangers"" is lacking in this exact same neglected details.",1506902400,,717,5.410714285714286

7442628,1,B015KRERII,"Although there is a strong native presence in this program, I was absolutely appalled that Myles Standish was not mentioned until 1 hour and 29 minutes into this program!  Was this because of his preemptive, and often brutal, strikes against the indigenous population that would be difficult to explain considering the enormous role he played as assistant governor, military leader and treasurer for the colony from its inception until he died?  Obviously, it was not William Bradford who ordered recognizance operations and building the fence around the settlement; it was Myles Standish. I think it very likely that posing the bodies of dead settlers against trees with guns beside them in the forest to trick the natives into thinking they were guards was Standish's idea, considering that he was the only member with extensive military training. Perhaps it is also due to the fact that Standish was never a Puritan, although he was hired by them prior to leaving England; does this invalidate his contributions?! I think the scholarship behind this ""documentary"" is seriously undermined by the conscious airbrushing of Myles Standish's considerable, and vital, contributions to the survival of the Plymouth Colony, not only from the first shore party but for decades afterward. Historians may not like his occasional serious lapses of judgment as regards the native population, but his contributions to the very survival of the colony were immense, and it is shameful that these contributions were minimized nearly to zero because the makers of this spurious ""documentary"" decided that the story was more palatable without him.

7442633,4,B015KRERII,"I'm a big fan of Ric Burns, whose documentaries I sometimes find even more emotional and powerful than those of his better known (and also wildly talented) brother Ken.

This re-examination of the story of the Pilgrims who came to the New World on the Mayflower, and the ways with which the myths -- sometimes self-created myths, sometimes those that arose over time --  differ from reality was always interesting.  I also found it gratifyingly complex in its examinations of the nature of origin stories we tell ourselves as human beings and as a nation.  And lastly it was chock full of facts I didn't know. But I didn't find the kind of emotional power of some of Burns' other films; ""Death and the Civil War"", ""Into the Deep"", ""Eugene O'Neill"", ""New York"" etc.

None-the-less, I was never bored, and by the end I understood a lot more about this important - in event and symbolic meaning - piece of American history than I did before seeing the film, and that's enough for me to feel it was more than worthwhile.",1486252800,11,1016,4.5911602209944755
