7889478,5,6305438528,Great movie about the glorious year of 1999 in Dallas Stars hockey. This has been something nice to watch while waiting for this stupid lockout to end.,1354147200,,151,4.62962962962963
7889479,5,6305438528,"This is an excellent movie for the hockey purist.

The old Minnesota North Stars leave the froze tundra of the land of 10,000 lakes to an uncertain future south of the Mason- Dixon line, home of the Dallas Cowboys, no less.

After a couple of kick-butt seasons, the novelty wears off, and it is gut-check time, and I'm not talking about when you take a stick to the 'ole breadbasket. The franchise needs to take a long hard look at itself; the seats 'ain't filled like they used to be, the passion's wearin' off. The honeymoon's over.

Then comes the run for the cup. You are going to have to buy the VHS to catch ""the rest of the story,"" as Paul Harvey would say, but the story is superbly told, and superbly shot. Plenty of hockey action that will give you chills.

You'll watch it time and again.",1110672000,3,799,4.342281879194631

7889481,5,6305438528,"As a native of Dallas, I'm obviously not the most impartial reviewer, but I loved this video.  Anyone who has followed the team since the move to Dallas will appreciate the team history, and the drama of the Stars' Cup  run hardly needs any editing to make a great video.  I have watched this  video many, many times, and I can't get the theme song out of my head.  OK,  so if you're not a fan, maybe this isn't for you, but it's a must-have for  the serious Stars lover.",953769600,4,471,4.166666666666667
