2925947,5,B000UVV2BK,"This Movie Was Good Surprised Because Not All Actors Who Are Rap Stars Movies Turn Out That Well, How Ever I Think That The Wutang Rap Artist Did Very Well.",1391299200,,156,4.233333333333333
2925948,3,B000UVV2BK,Could have been better and more detailed.  Nowhere near the best.  Looks like a cheap budget cut of a movie about blacks and drugs.  Would not recommend to a friend.  Janice,1373241600,,173,4.483870967741935
2925949,1,B000UVV2BK,"This movie is outright garbage!  A total waste of time and money.  The DVD box cover is more impressive than the entire movie itself (serious!).  This is nothing but a B-movie, an independent flick.  It really should state somewhere on the cover that this is a B-movie.  Anyway, don't bother renting this, it was a total mistake on my part.  I thought it might be something because I saw Reakwon's name on the cover (reminiscent of the movie Black and White from 2000).  The previous review sums up the plot pretty good.  A straight up wannabe gangster movie, but way too lame to pull it off.  Too much handy cam action for my taste.  Some might think this to be a masterpiece of some sort, but the bottom line its just too amateur for the average movie goer.",1197331200,,759,4.434782608695652
2925950,4,B000UVV2BK,This is an above average independent flick. Takes place in New York City. Black guy from hood and white guy from clubs have to work together. The two leads do a good job in pulling off that Training Day - Ethan/Denzel vibe.  I thought the first few scencs were a little weak and Reakwon doesn't have that big of a part. Overall the film has some funny parts and keeps you entertained.,1188172800,3,384,4.333333333333333

8215253,2,B000UVV2BK,"This feels, looks and sounds like a high-school film project. Horrible sound recording (maybe they used a mobile phone?), bad editing, bad acting, bad script, most ridiculously bad/unrealistic gun-fire sounds, etc...",1453075200,,216,6.0
8215254,2,B000UVV2BK,"Slow moving older movie. Wasn't great for me. Fast forwarded and snoozed through the dull, drawn out parts. Seems like Amazon Prime's claim to have thousands of prime movies but it seems they are really loaded with a ton of oldy moldy movies from the 70s, 80s, & 90s.",1438300800,,267,4.469387755102041
8215255,1,B000UVV2BK,"I am a fan of off beat flicks however this is the absolute worst movie that I have ever seen. The only saving grace in it was the baby blue '69 SS Camaro. My goodness. The film quality looks like first gen cell phone cameras at best with deplorable sound even in small rooms; the sound track is horrendous Garageband pre-made loop tracks; the acting, don't even get me started. Plot holes galore; unnecessary scenes which don't even drive the plot; TERRIBLE writing. The budget must have been just enough to ""pay"" the actors because they couldn't even afford to use squibs when people were shot or blanks for the guns to simulate gunfire. THERE WAS EVEN POWER POWDER. POWER POWDER! I can't even describe the level of distaste that I have for this movie. It's like a poop sandwich made with poop bread. This movie shames NYC. Please, I implore you, don't even watch the trailer let alone the ""movie"". It's not worth it. It's torturous and odious to the nth.",1424217600,3,956,4.563953488372093
8215256,1,B000UVV2BK,"it was so awful I stopped trying to watch it after maybe 30 minutes, just to give it a chance.  I've seen low budget, b-actor movies.  This one is a total waste of anyone's time..  such Poor acting, story line, momentum.  Everything about it was horrible",1418515200,,254,4.456521739130435
8215257,4,B000UVV2BK,"Excellent flick! a action packed thrill ride. If you enjoy a punch in the face by a perfect stranger, you will dig this movie. Peace.",1417219200,,133,4.36

8215259,1,B000UVV2BK,"I did not like the movie, had to turn it off. Street thug acting, I suppose it would be ok if you were into that kind of thing.",1402790400,,127,3.5714285714285716
