8320156,3,B001LXXNV8,OK Blue Demon semi sci-fi.  Blue Demon fights female invaders who are intent on taking poor male Mexican specimens back to Mexi-Mars.  The femme-aliens hole up at an isolated inn for a base of operations.  There are a couple of wrestling matches thrown in.  The quality of the DVD release is OK but not sharp and clear like other Mexican DVD releases.  Not bad for Mexican wrestler fans.,1390608000,,387,4.632352941176471
