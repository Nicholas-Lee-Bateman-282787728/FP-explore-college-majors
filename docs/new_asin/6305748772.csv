7893911,2,6305748772,"I bought this hoping it would be just some cute girls taking their clothes of. And that's what I got. Still it managed to make me feel disappointed.
Sadly, the strippers aren't the only ones being amateurish in this DVD. The whole production is amateurish, even if the picture quality is good enough. The stripping in itself is just not done in a particularly exciting or even tasteful way, it's just like a long wait to see what the girl looks like naked. The whole thing would have benefited from being sped up a bit, I think. Sometimes less is more. If you don't know how to strip then at least don't drag on for too long.
One day I might get my own DVD editing program for my computer, and then I'll probably be able to edit together considerably better versions of these 32 strip""teases"".",1223078400,,793,4.438356164383562
7893912,1,6305748772,"If you really want to buy this dvd, you have nothing better to buy with your dollars. your money is burning a hole in your pocket. Buy it. After you wait the week or so to get it, get a 6-pack and waste an hour or so. I know the last stripper is a paid porno star. She has a short but sweet skit. If it weren't for her, I'd give this a ""0"" rating.",1128384000,3,347,3.64
7893913,4,6305748772,"I love this title, the music is so-so but atleast it isn't anoying like most of the time.  The girls are normal looking, with a few silicon here and there.  What sells this dvd is how cheerful some (not all) of the models are when they are dancing.  The camera moves at different angles, sometimes giving a top or bottom view in just the perfect way.  I wish the producer would consentrate more on the setting around the models a bit more instead of fixing a camera on a model for 10 mins.  Those 10 mins can be charming or boring if the model are not of your type.",1092441600,6,565,4.146788990825688
7893914,1,6305748772,"The basic idea was good. Get a bunch of pretty, unexperienced women to do strip tease dances. Except that apparently wasn't really the idea in this case, except by accident. The maker of the video seemed to have no idea of what a strip tease is about. Or eroticism, for that matter. For the most part, the women don't dance, but instead follow cold instructions on how to look dumb. A lot of crawling around on the floor, gasping like dying fish, and nervous rubbing of the body (but not that part). Most succeed admirably at appearing dumb, the winner being a poor girl who becomes hobbled by her dropped panties, a situation the cameraman finds very interesting.

In the end, the viewer hangs around to see what the woman's pubic hair looks like.  The waiting can be shortened and the strip improved by viewing it at double speed.

The problem, I think, is that the so-called producer is approaching an activity that could--if shown in private surroundings--be very erotic, but instead sees it with a pornographic eye. An early teen pornographic eye. This is not to say that one sees any spread vulvas, but just that the women get no respect. Nor does the audience.

 The camerawork isn't very good (or sharp), the sound is insipid and irrelevant, and virtually all of the acts run out of steam partway through. Anticipation is usually missing. The carpet appears dirty, the shower in one scene definitely is dirty, and it seems likely the producer is a scumbag. This doesn't mean there aren't some woody-producing performances. Three, including one girl-girl show. Almost forgot: some of the women are scary.

 The DVD should serve as inspiration. If someone with a brain and the right attitude could get hold of a suitable camera, talk a bunch of pretty beach bunnies who can dance into baring it all while looking like nice girls, and rehearse a little, a classic could be created. Just do everything different from this one.

 Tip: if you must have this one, buy it at a yard sale for $2.50 like I did.",1090800000,34,2008,4.681818181818182
7893915,4,6305748772,"Yes, the 4 hours of dancing is good. You'll see some pretty sweet looking ladies, doing some very good erotic dancing. BUT....you might want to watch this program with the sound off, as you will hear some of the cheesiest, most annoying music with no lyrics to it. Oh man, the music is horrible.",999993600,7,295,4.481481481481482
