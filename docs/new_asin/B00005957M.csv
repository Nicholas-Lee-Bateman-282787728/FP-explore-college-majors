7933079,2,B00005957M,"Good information, if rather superficial. I know since I lived a long time in England and still visit as a tourist every year or so.  However, the issue I have with this video is the quality. It's like a print of a print of a print. Shaky stills, outdated clothing gives this away as created in a time long ago and far away.  Looking at Stonehenge, for example...well, things have changed, let's just leave it at that.  The color photography is way way off--red buses are faded orange, like an old color photo. Some of the inane comments of the narrator get to be annoying--stating the obvious (in particular, when discussing shopping in outdoor markets--oh please.)  So, I'm disappointed because I'm bringing a friend for our upcoming outing in the UK and this was to be an introduction. Sad. Sad. Sad.  Thank goodness the UK is not going to be disappointing.",1423699200,2,859,4.662251655629139
7933080,4,B00005957M,"We used this as a preview for a student who was going abroad to study. It is well filmed, and hits the highlights of areas you would want to visit in England.  I can recommend it for a good overview of the country, with a focus on London.",1329436800,,238,3.9583333333333335
7933081,1,B00005957M,I am very unhappy with it as I can not watch it on my DVD player I cannot send it back as I have opened It so I won't be purchasing anymore from Amazom,1285977600,,151,3.4705882352941178
7933082,4,B00005957M,"This beautifully photographed video shows an amazing array of locations all over England; not just London, Bath and Stratford-on-Avon. The diverse geography of such a small area is just incredible and makes me, for one, want to spend months traveling Great Britain. (If only!!) However, most areas are covered so briefly as to be very unsatisfying. Having said this, tho, more in depth coverage of the Lake District, Cornwall, Norfolk Broads, et al would result in a multi-video set. Hmmm..not a bad idea! My very favorite segment is of the lovely mechanical silver swan in the Bowes Museum near Durham. It is just sooo cool! My visit to England in '08 was going to concentrate on Cornwall, but now I really want to see this swan bobbing it's head and grabbing at silver fish! Just incredible. This video is a real treat.",1198540800,,821,4.788732394366197
7933083,3,B00005957M,"This video is an excellent pictoral guide to England...circa 1970-something! The video is entertaining, though a bit dry, and centers mainly around historical and scenic sites. There is nothing about modern London or modern life in England. The clothing and grain of the video give it away. What it does show is beautiful and interesting, no doubt, but alot can change in 30 years. Problem is, you wouldn't know it by watching this dvd.",1071360000,20,436,4.905405405405405
7933084,5,B00005957M,"I have many videos on England but this one is a real gem, I think the first day I watched the whole DVD twice, well done.",1067558400,7,121,3.6923076923076925
7933085,5,B00005957M,"This is an excellent value for those looking for a visual overview of England.  The scope is amazingly broad, covering almost every region From Cornwall to Hadrian's Wall.  Unlike many travel videos, there is very little ""filler"" material here (no chintzy theatricals or human interest fluff), leaving much more room for real content.  The narration is clear and informative, although somewhat sparse - the emphasis is obviously on the visual presentation, which I thought was very well done.
The Main Feature (82 minutes) covers not only standard tourist highlights such as London, Bath, York, the Cotswolds etc. but also includes lesser known spots such as Boston, Ely, and Lincoln.  The only obvious omission is the Industrial Midlands (Liverpool, Coventry, Ironbridge, etc - perhaps not a great loss), which as I recall was not mentioned.
The breadth of the Main Feature is well complimented by the three ""DVD Extra"" segments (approx 35 minutes), which provide more detailed looks at several castles and stately homes, including Castle Howard, Warwick, Chatsworth and several others.
If you're hoping to see a specific locale, you may be disappointed, but if you just want to enjoy well-presented scenery and architecture, ""Discovering England"" is quite rewarding.",1001721600,79,1268,5.35678391959799
