7842938,4,6303308309,"The sound of this DVD is Stereo (LPCM) and the image is 4:3.  Both Fantasy Operas were recorded in 1985.  Expectations should be adjusted accordingly.
Opera, as an art form, has always possessed a tension between music and lyrics. In these fantasy operas, the real winner is the stage designs. They are a reflection of Sendaks illustrations, where the characters come to life.  The props and the characters are believable and the whole set is very imaginative. Kids, including those over 50, will certainly enjoy it.
Knussens orchestral music is nice and fits the plots very well.  This is less the case with the vocalization, however, in particular in Where the Wild Things Are. I find the vocal scores too harsh and even unpleasant at times, and am not sure children will find them appealing.  Higglety Pigglety Pop! has some nicer tunes that will fit the intended audience better.
Although some parents will argue about the suitability of these stories for children today, the presentation as an opera, with music, lyrics and staging, is worth watching.  It seems to me that new productions with up to date sound and image format are warranted.",1420502400,,1147,4.917098445595855

7842941,1,6303308309,"While the opera and the performance may be wonderful, I cannot tell because the set of disks I received twice are not playable on US-sold DVD players.  Although the Product Details says that the disks are ""All Region"" what was delivered was limited to Regions 2.3.4.5 which exclude the USA.",1357257600,4,290,4.8
7842942,3,6303308309,The acting and choreography are okay to pretty good. The picture is a bit fuzzy and the sound quality below perfect. The music is not to my taste. The set and costumes are by Maurice Sendak and are excellent. If the story were set to more melodious music it would be a pleasure to enjoy Where the Wild Things Are just as much as the book.,1356048000,,338,4.136363636363637
7842943,5,6303308309,This CD is one of the best children's CD's I have seen and  heard.  It is such a big production that it would be very difficult to stage just anywhere so getting the CD is a good choice for many.  Maurice Sendak lives through Oliver Knussen's music.,1323388800,,249,4.25531914893617
