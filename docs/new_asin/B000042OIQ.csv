I have worked my way up through Level 7 and the thing to remember with these videos is that it is a series. You need to start at the beginning. Yes it is costly. But i have found it to be worth every penny. Things are not repeated and new information is given with each Level. If you skip a level, YES you will be lost. Also you must take you time with each video before moving on. After Level 5 i can make pants that fit great.

The video is of a woman's hands pointing at a finished project set on a table. The hands point to parts of the project while a voice, as if reading from a script, narrates. The hands do not display or move the project.  If the narration comes to a point that isn't shown, the hands stop pointing and your left looking at a still picture, rewinding and guessing what you are supposed to be looking at. I assume the next picture is a couple of completed steps but I don't know what or how they were done. There are no demonstrations or explanations. I gave up on guessing and shelved the video. I rate it terribly overpriced.",1115683200,3,790,4.448275862068965
