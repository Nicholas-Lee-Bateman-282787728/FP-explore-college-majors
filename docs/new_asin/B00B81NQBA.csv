For example, I missed the political undertones. I'm not Irish. I suspect my ignorance comes from not growing up with that dynamic. However, the veiled political inferences are something anyone should be able to relate to. The psychological aspects are the crux of the film. Again, the commentary helps clarify that as well. It took about 2 or 3 viewings for me to see how briliant this film actually is. The director hit the nail on the proverbial head regarding sociopathic behavior and motivation. Emmet Scanlan. I saw Mr. Scanlan on The Fall and suspected he was capable of so much more. I was right. Although relatively unknown to US audiences, Scanlan is, in my opinion, one of the most talented actors out there. Bravo to this film for being exactly what it is, with no apologies. One of the more thought provoking movies that I have seen in a long time. If you're looking for something light to watch, this isn't it.- othwrwise, I recommend it.",1493856000,,1090,4.712041884816754

8563834,2,B00B81NQBA,"This film seems to celebrate debauchery. The premise is inconsistent. A sociopath wants to debunk rules society has, but his method of doing so is a rule itself. He destroys anything that has merit around him and imbues hate. The director suggests this film speaks to Irish film making. Other than the characters being Irish, there is no reasonable relation to the Irish film making that the film speaks to in of itself. The director profanely argues in an interview that this is meant to be a critique of an anti-moral character, but seemingly celebrates the degeneration of individuals through the lack of use of narrative devices and closure. This film is fail. A lesson should be learned after watching a film and NOT be left up to an interview to make sense of it.

This film is best appreciated by those who understood the social events that took place around the time of which it was produced.

Ironically, there are parallels between the director and the character Charlie in terms of their estranged relationships with those around them, including family. In some ways it is a subconscious film about how chaotic life could turn out in response to the way cards are dealt.",1460332800,,1181,4.784313725490196

8563837,5,B00B81NQBA,"Disturbing, yet thought-provoking film. Scanlan plays the sociopathic main character brilliantly. The film definitely made me think of American Psycho, A Clockwork Orange ... that genre of dark, gritty, quirky, disturbing story line.",1376697600,2,233,6.090909090909091
