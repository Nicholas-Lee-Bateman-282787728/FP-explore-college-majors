8130950,5,B000GEIRA0,"The description of this movie compares it to American Pie, but I see two key differences.  First of all, the budget of American Pie is about 100 times larger than the budget of this movie.  Second of all, this movie is much more realistic and identifiable. The characters are better and more imperfect, and just like in real life, not everyone gets laid in the end.",1373932800,,365,4.515151515151516

8130956,5,B000GEIRA0,"Those Brits! I saw this movie on DVD while I was travelling in Australia, and I gotta tell you I was surprised! I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! It's pretty much a standard teen-movie - American Pie - parents go on vacation, hormonal guys have a party to get it on with the ladies... excepts somehow, becuase it's in England it feels, I dunno, different. The guys seem real, and the party, amazingly doesn't feel bolted on like it does in our (US) teen comedies.

There are two really cool scenes - each of them with Neil's best bud, Matt. One of them they're trying to choose - like they'd ever get the chance to - between 'Britney or Kylie(Minogue - the Australian fox)' - Matt introduces all sorts of sicker and sicker things to chose from - ending up with a really gross out one (on the trailer). The second one has a line - ""Neil, the day I take sex advice from you is the day I chop my nob off and sell it on Ebay"". They really made the movie for me.

Neil, the main guy, is a lovable cross between Mr Bean and Jude Law - and really someone I wanna see in another movie.

By the end of the movie me and my Aussie friend were totally into it - and unlike Pie, I was actaully a bit moved! Which is sad really - becuase we only picked this DVD because it had a cute chick on the front! :) (You're not let down there, btw).

THESE GUYS SHOULD BE MAKING THE NEXT STUDIO TEEN COMEDY, because as far as I could tell, they really 'get it'. Anyway, psyched it's coming out over here - the one I bought in Australia didn't work here - which [...] - as I carried it all over the world on my back for 6 months!",1151884800,10,1592,4.044444444444444
