1218732,5,B00000I1OI,"When I can do no other form of exercise, I can do this workout.  When I cannot get moving during the day, I can do this workout.  When I am too depressed to even think about anything, I can do this workout.  And no matter where I find myself during the day, it always makes me feel better.  The length is perfect for a busy lifestyle and for setting goals you can stick to.  When I am feeling motivated I'll do it twice or add another video... but without fail, I always do this one.  It's like a warm bath or a massage.  It's like a moving meditation and invigorating workout in one.  I have never written a review before, but I was online looking for the 20 minute intermediate sequal (sorry to say I couldn't find one), and could not resist putting in my two cents worth.",1010102400,15,774,4.1824324324324325
1218733,4,B00000I1OI,"This is a decent short yoga workout, although I would be a little confused if I were a beginner.  I definitely work up a sweat with this one, and I feel the flexibility benefits.  But, I would prefer to hold the positions for longer to develop muscular stamina/endurance.  None of the positions in this video are held for longer than 2 seconds!  It's a decent workout for getting back into yoga after having a baby, which is what I am using it for.",999648000,6,448,4.36144578313253
1218734,5,B00000I1OI,"I don't think this tape is for beginners. You have to be familiar with the basic poses and how to postion your body for balance to use this tape. I suggest Yoga Journal's Beginner's w/Patricia Walden, like the other reviewer suggested. However, I don't remember if she does upward facing dog in that one which is on this tape. I don't think so.
Anyway, it's great when you don't have time for an hour of practice. It gives you a little charge in the morning and then when you have more time you can do your hour class or tape.
 And for the reviewer who is looking at Rodney's ""private parts"", you are really not interested in yoga because if you were that's the last thing you would be paying attention to if at all. One has to make themselves as comfortable as possible when doing the poses.",992995200,6,792,4.351351351351352
1218735,5,B00000I1OI,"As a 28 year old mother of two who is about 20 pounds overweight, I find this workout just hard enough to feel challenging, but not so difficult that I felt discouraged at the beginning.  I don't get out of breath, but I sweat some and at the end I feel in my muscles that I have done some real work.  I had never done yoga before, and I'm not particularly athletic, and I didn't find the poses too difficult to manage at the beginning (except the one where you're seated with both your legs and your torso elevated with your arms extended in front of you, but I can do it now).  After about two weeks of doing the workout not quite every day the more strenuous poses are a lot easier, and I can feel a difference in my muscle tone.  And I've lost six pounds (though I've also been dieting, so I can't give the video all the credit for that).  Also, another reviewer mentioned the speedo in a very negative way - it's a little distracting at first, but I certainly wouldn't call it offensive.",992476800,19,992,4.227513227513228
1218736,3,B00000I1OI,"I bought this tape as my 2nd yoga tape. I had never done yoga before and tried this one after about 2 weeks of beginning yoga. I thought it would be alot harder but it wasnt. I thought it was a little boring. Some of the poses were repeated 6,7,8 times. I learned downward facing dog, but to repeat it over and over, I wanted to learn more poses. The poses in the tape aren't hard to get into and he tells you somewhat how to do them. More flexablity needed than strength I think. I'll use this tape for about a month then I'll need a harder one because this one doesnt seem to challenge me.",986342400,14,591,4.05982905982906
1218737,5,B00000I1OI,"I bought this tape because I'd heard about all the movie stars being oh-so-fit just doing Yoga. I have to say, I was pretty skeptical that what I considered ""stretches"" could actually be effective. After all, I've done high-impact aerobics most of my adult life to stay in shape.
I strictly watched this tape the first time so I'd know what to expect. Then I rewound it and I've been using it on a daily basis ever since!
As I mentioned before, I used to do high-impact aerobics. It was the only way I knew how to stay in shape but it was very hard on my bad knees.
Rodney Yee's Yoga tape really challenges your strength and stretches your muscles without jarring your joints like aerobics does. I do Yoga in combination with a light walking program on my treadmill. After I walk, I use the tape and get some good solid stretches in.
I am so much stronger and before I started the walking program, I used this tape alone. I noticed a difference almost immediately. Even now, my muscles still ache a bit because this tape is so good.
Rodney Yee's Power Yoga for Beginners is challenging for those who are already strong and in shape but also easy on those who are trying to get in shape. My mom has arthritis and she can make it through this workout!",984873600,55,1249,4.364806866952789
1218738,5,B00000I1OI,"When I was in Maui last year, I took my first yoga class at the resort we stayed in.  I enjoyed it so much.  I have not been able to set a regular exercise program in my life for years.  I am usually too tired, too stressed or don't have the time or energy after working many hours.  If you fit into the same category, Power Yoga for beginners is the perfect solution.  The 20 minutes is easier to fit in than a trip to the gym and not as demanding on your body as aerobics.  When I am too tired or stressed, I look forward to this workout.  It relaxes me and rejuvenates me.  I started using it every day.  I feel much better about my body and my health.  I have been able to tone up considerably.  (I've even gotten several compliments on my figure.) To add variety, I worked in other Rodney Yee tapes to help me work on specific areas, the dreaded abs and the back.  Best of all, it brings me back to the beautiful island of Maui.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",983059200,21,953,4.0864864864864865
1218739,2,B00000I1OI,"He goes to fast.  He shows the 5 basic moves and then he takes off into the routine.  It was hard for me to follow him, especially as a beginner.  I allowed a family member to watch the tape.  They said the same thing.  I'd like to exchange this video for another beginners version.",979603200,4,282,4.148148148148148
1218740,5,B00000I1OI,"I started with the AM/PM set from Living Arts and knew I would long enjoy yoga.  After a while I needed something a little more challenging and opted for the Power Yoga.
This video with Rodney Yee is excellent.  While, I still have trouble with the triangle poses...I enjoy this video every time I put it into the VCR.  The positions go quickly, so I am not bored, and yet with each ""class"" I can see myself getting better and more flexible.  I work up a nice little sweat and can feel the muscle workout the next day.
As a note to those who find yoga ""too hard and only for skinny people"" you should understand that learning yoga takes practice and it isn't something you can do right away.  So you can't touch your toes or do a great cobra pose...not yet, but give it time and you will see.  And you don't need all their props.  I use our blanket from the back of the couch, a long leather belt and if needed, when I can't reach the floor, I have two soup cans instead.
I love the way yoga has changed my life. Near daily practice has lessened my need to snack all the time, improved my sleeping and has greatly improved my outlook towards myself.
I would recommend this tape to those who have already been through some yoga workouts.  This is not the tape I would start someone, new to the practice, out on.  I consider this an ""advanced beginner"" tape.",978739200,,1356,4.265625
1218741,2,B00000I1OI,"I liked the high speed but it is definately not for beginners. There is  virtually no instruction on how to do moves correctly, and you could end up  hurting yourself if you haven't been taught the correct way  previously.
Also, I felt very rushed and there's very little warm up. You  kind of have to do something else before starting.
Yoga Zone is much  better.",968803200,19,363,4.523076923076923
1218742,1,B00000I1OI,"I've done other power yoga videos and liked them, but I really hated this  one.  Not only is it very short, there is hardly any instruction given on  how to do the moves.  Instead, Rodney Yee chooses to focus about the  ""spiritual"" aspects of yoga, so if you're not into the  touchy-feely stuff, definitely stay away.
Also, squeamish viewers should  be warned that Mr. Yee performs the entire workout in a tiny speedo-type  bathing suit.",968284800,5,437,4.733333333333333
1218743,5,B00000I1OI,"After doing plenty of research about yoga - such as breathing technique, posture, and purpose of many positions - I was left on my own and lacked motivation to practice everyday.  What good is knowledge of yoga without  the motivation to practice it?  Rodney Yee certainly provides that  motivation!  The calmness he exudes, and how easy he makes each position  look, makes you want to incorporate yoga into your physical and mental life  just so you can have the power of body and mind he seems to have.  I've  always found that the worst motivator in any exercise routine is the idea  ""I have to do this so I can get skinny"".  Rodney Yee makes you  realize its not about your weight, its about having power, and strength,  and well-being.  Great for anyone who wants to feel every muscle in their  body work, as well as people who just want some stress relief!",963360000,13,862,4.542483660130719
1218744,4,B00000I1OI,"One should read the editorial reviewer's last two sentences with care (and the comments of other customers).  This video is not for persons who are ignorant of basic yoga positions, because Yee doesn't teach them.  This  does not mean, however, that the video doesn't provide a good workout;  physically fit people may be able to watch carefully and pick up the  positions. (A friend who is a yoga practitioner said that she wouldn't  recommend folks doing that w/o some prior instruction).",960595200,18,490,4.987654320987654
1218745,5,B00000I1OI,"Let me start this off w/ I've taken a few ""health club"" Power Yoga classes to see what it's about.  I loved the slight raising of the heart rate w/ the flexibility & stretching in a calming format.  So,  when I no longer had a schedule to enable me to attend the classes, I  bought this tape on recommendation from my instructor.  I found it to be an  EXCELLENT beginning Power Yoga tape.  But I do recommend watching it first  if you've never tried Yoga before - to get down the basics of poses and the  ""flow.""  It is not, however, a tape for the more  spiritual/metaphysical practices of yoga for those that are serious in that  aspect.  There are other ""styles"" of yoga more suited for this.  Power Yoga is DEFINITELY the ""trendy, health club"" style (of  Yoga), but great for those of us that want slight aerobic benefit from  flowing quickly from pose to pose while increasing flexibility &  strength in one!  Rodney Yee's directions are clear and the scenery  beautiful!",956966400,32,976,4.53757225433526
1218746,4,B00000I1OI,"In starting off in Power Yoga the novice has no place to go and the praticing student does not know where to go.  I found this veideo very hard to follow.  I have been studying Yoga for over 30 years and still found it  very hard and confusing.  Yoga is not some slic aerobic hop around.  It is  an inner voyage along with the outer sifting thru what is, what has, and  what can be.",953078400,23,382,4.013333333333334
1218747,5,B00000I1OI,I've only been doing Yoga for about a month.  I did this tape last night for the first time and I really liked it a lot.  I used it as a cool down after a one-hour aerobic and weight session.  It made me work up a sweat  again while feeling totally relaxed.  If I can get myself out of bed in the  morning I think I'll use this as a morning routine.,949449600,12,349,3.7777777777777777
1218748,4,B00000I1OI,"This was my first yoga tape although I am limber from years of ballet and gymnastics...The first few times I did it was a real workout! I felt I really improved after only about 2 weeks and now it's a great way to for me  to stay in shape and stretch my body. Definitely not for beginners, though.",941587200,25,297,4.120689655172414
1218749,4,B00000I1OI,I wanted to try yoga as an addition to my normal workout routine and this video is a great compliment to any excercize program.  It is relatively easy to follow once you begin and works all muscle groups! Plus - the last  few minutes of relaxation exercises are bliss at the end of the work day! I  highly recommend.,939254400,13,316,4.322033898305085
1218750,5,B00000I1OI,"This is a short efficient workout -- good for intermediates.  You have to know a little bit about yoga and be able to do the postures correctly because the instructor moves quickly.  If you are looking for a longer  workout, this is not the tape for you.  However, it is perfect when I am in  a crunch for time and I really enjoy it.",930441600,2,333,4.140625

7909357,5,B00000I1OI,"When I first began yoga, this tape quickly become my favorite after familiarizing myself w/ basic poses (using Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss).  I would recommend this to someone who has learned the basics and is looking for something a little more challenging.
Rodney Yee is practicing on a beach, in Hawaii.  The majority of this workout conisists of Sun Salutations w/ lunges and Warrior poses. There are a few seated or lying down moves and a nice 5 min. cooldown at the end.  Total workout time: 20  min.
All in all, this is a great tape to have if you are a beginner who is ready to move on OR as a standby for the more advanced practitioner as its a nice quick, feel good workout.",1119225600,3,690,4.409448818897638
7909358,5,B00000I1OI,"This was one of two tapes I got when I started practicing yoga.  (The other was Living Arts Total Yoga, which I also like, but which is somewhat different in style and is 60 minutes long.)  I agree with other reviewers that Rodney Yee goes through the poses very quickly, not allowing much time to contemplate them or adjust into them.  But as a beginner, I did not find this an impediment to enjoying the practice.  As one reviewer pointed out, yoga is a journey.  You're not going to be able to do every pose perfectly the first time.  In fact, the beginning of every yoga tape urges the user to view the whole tape first.  Show of hands, how many have actually done that?  Yeah, me neither.  Then maybe we'll have to accept that we'll be a little awkward the first few times.

I have since bought many other tapes (and some books) that have helped me understand each pose better.  However, I still learn something new every time I do this workout.  I like the flow of one pose to another.  I like the repetition, too.  And it is a nice little complete workout.  You'll stretch, strengthen, breathe hard, stretch some more, and relax.  The poses are somewhat challenging, yet very accessible to beginners.  I always feel very bendy and centered afterward.

It's important to me to do some form of exercise every day.  The length of this tape makes it easy to fit into my life.  It's the tape I reach for most often for that reason.

7909359,2,B00000I1OI,"I consider myself an average yoga-er, but this is definately not a tape for beginners.  you have to know what the poses are beforehand, as he moves from pose to pose very quickly, not really explaining how to get into some of the poses, which someone with no experience (aka beginner) would get lost.  I would recommend this tape to more advanced yoga fans, as you will know most of these poses and be able to keep up.  My only gripe is with his billing of this as for beginners, otherwise great workout.",1091491200,7,504,4.397849462365591
7909360,4,B00000I1OI,"I had never tried actual yoga before using this video, proving that it is an excellent beginners tape, for I was able to follow the instruction easily. Although it is necesarry to do the yoga along with the video several times before being fully able to keep up and actually feel any relaxing benefits, but after a few viewings it becomes relaxing. This video was a great start and I plan on continuing with more advanced videos from the same series.",1049587200,2,450,4.567901234567901
7909361,5,B00000I1OI,"While this tape by Rodney Yee might seem a bit overwhelming for someone brand new to yoga, it is certainly more of a beginners tape in the area of power yoga. Just try the first Bryan Kest tape ""Energize"" or Baron Baptiste's ""Hot Yoga 1"" (which are both also fantastic) and you'll quickly see the difference in terms of its intensity and the length of the practice compared to the Yee tape.
 A tape that would be perhaps better for a newer student of yoga who would like to try a ""power"" style might be Yoga Zone's ""Introduction to Power Yoga"" which has a flow style but is perhaps a bit less overly intense than the Yee tape. In general the Yoga Zone tapes are quite excellent and many are broken down into two 20 minute sessions which make them very easy to fit in for those with very little time.
 Anyway, back to the Rodney Yee tape:
 This Power Yoga ""Stamina"" tape is one that I enjoy doing on those days when I want to do more of a ""Power"" practice but don't have the time or perhaps the energy to do something more intense.
 It has a really great flow and covers many of the basic standing poses along with variations on Sun Salutations as well as back bending postures such as ""bow"" and ""Camel"".
 What's also really nice is that it's just about 22 or so minutes once you get past the three minutes or so of introduction (I like to use that time for some simple twists and light stretches before the main routine starts) so it's a routine you can always fit in timewise.
 Anyway, I would recommend this tape for someone with a little bit of Yoga experience who wants to ""up the tempo"" a bit and yet doesn't have the time or perhaps the stamina or energy on a particular day to do a longer, more intense routine. I think that anyone though can benefit from a routine like this even if it is their main yoga practice because though it is short it is pretty thorough and will certainly yield positive results done on a regular basis.
 As far as the complaints about not wanting to do the tape because of Yee's tight bathing suit... If you're doing the routine and focusing on your breath and the poses, you won't be concerned with looking at the screen except for an occasional reference and hence you won't be too concerned about his choice of attire.
 One last thing, regarding the fact that the tape keeps repeating certain poses. For those new to yoga, that is actually very much standard in terms of yoga practice which incorporates ""vinyasa"" practice which consists inserting up-dog and down-dog between other poses in order to keep heat in the body and it also helps to ""re-calibrate"" ones body after other poses as well as builds strength and flexibility.
 If you'd like to add variety into your practice, other relatively short yet challenging yoga routines I'd recommend are Baron Baptiste's ""Unlocking Athletic Power"" and Rainbeau Mars ""Pure Power"" and ""Pure Sweat"" from her ""Sacred Yoga"" 4 tape set. Also Yoga Zone's ""Fat Burning"" tape is a 20 minute routine that will push you pretty hard for such a short practice.

7909362,4,B00000I1OI,This is NOT AT ALL meant for beginners. I'm pretty flexible but it does strain to watch the tape and simultaneously do the exercise at the same time. SO I suggest that one sits and watches the entire segment first before you try it out.,1043452800,2,236,4.266666666666667

7909364,5,B00000I1OI,"I'm no expert on yoga, so I don't feel qualified to rate this tape as part of an overall study of the discipline. The video has worked very well for me so I gave it 5 stars. However, I did feel a need to respond to some of the criticism in previous reviews. This tape is very good for beginners. Yes, the first few times you go through it you will have a hard time keeping up. That's the way it should be! If it was easy the first time through, or if Rodney Yee explained each move in detail, it would be useless after a dozen viewings. For yoga history or detailed information, buy a book. When you learn any of the Asian physical arts (or just about anything else for that matter) you improve gradually through observation and repetition. The fact that this video is challenging at first means that it will have lasting value as you gradually learn to keep up with the instructor and duplicate his movements with more accuracy and precision.
Also, this is an exercise regimen meant to be followed regularly. Some have complained about repetition of particular moves throughout the routine. These moves are some of the cornerstones of yoga, and they are repeated because they provide particular benefits when repeated in specific ways. Upward and downward-facing dog in particular are included to keep you back flexible throughout the routine. It would be far less effective (and probably more painful) if they were not repeated.
Finally, Rodney as ""exhibitionist"". This is an exercise video. It is about bodies. Mr. Yee displays nothing that you don't see in every gym or pool. Get over it.",1033776000,,1592,4.669039145907473

However, after watching 10 minutes of it I started wondering if there was something before ""beginner"" as there was certainly NO way I could keep up with this!  The moves were too fast, there was no instruction and by the time you registered exactly what the name of the pose was, he was already on to the next one! I'd skip this if you're just starting, this is definately more on the ""been there done for a few years"" route rather than just starting out.",1010361600,15,561,4.490196078431373
