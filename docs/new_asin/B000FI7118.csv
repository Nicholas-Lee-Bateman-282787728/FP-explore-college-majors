8122632,3,B000FI7118,This is an ok book to help teach your puppy new trick but if you don't give it a lot of practice over and over some of these can be very difficult to master.  There are other books that explain the process in a much clearer way and make learning easier for yourself and your pet.,1521331200,,279,3.982142857142857

8122634,1,B000FI7118,"It wasn't like I was hoping for. It does not teach you how to teach your dog the tricks. It mostly just shows other dogs doing it, and I am like wait!  I have had it for at least 2 months now. I wouldn't buy from this company again.",1413936000,,232,3.7346938775510203
8122635,5,B000FI7118,Great Video!  Will order volume 2 to go along with this one.  It explains and is very simple techniques to train your dog the tricks on this DVD.,1389225600,,145,4.142857142857143
8122636,1,B000FI7118,Big disappointment.  I wish I could get my money back.  These DVDs show trained dogs doing tricks but if you have an untrained dog you would do much better with something like the Bow Wow series by Virginia Broitman and Sherri Lippman.,1282176000,3,235,4.571428571428571
