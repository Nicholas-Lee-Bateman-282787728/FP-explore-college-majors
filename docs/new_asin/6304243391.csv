816183,5,6304243391,"Man, in my opinion, this has got to be the best FOD EVER as it is truely really the last FOD ever really, since FOD V (5) and VI (6)are almost like FOD boots with stock footage and bull. Faces of Death IV (4) almost, well  for me, it had me literally on my seat when I first viewed the tape, very  interesting sick stuff. On FOD IV, you'll actually witness grusome footage  unlike ANYTHING seen before on the past 3 FODs. I think, what a way to end  what was at one time one of the most talked about series of all time ...  FACES OF DEATH!",946425600,11,539,3.9537037037037037

816185,4,6304243391,"Faces of Death 4 was like one of the real deals.  About 99% of the footage is real because there were some real life situations, real blood, real accidents, real bodies,  etc.  When I recently saw it at the movies, I  almost got sick by it.  At least I give the movie a high rating.",919900800,2,282,4.054545454545455
816295,5,6304243391,"Faces of Death 4 is a update classic. This one focus on modern atrocities. Once again we get some fake scenes mix with real. But the film does get your attention. Killer tiger, electric chair mayhem, and we can't forget the beginning body in the oven. The thing I don't get, is way they switch the pig slaughterhouse scene. Instead we got a bunch of beetles eating the leftover flesh from the bones. But still this, and the first is a must own.",1253664000,,444,4.36144578313253

816297,1,6304243391,"Hey,

I saw this so-called Faces of Death IV on VHS many years ago and I just think it is revolting. It is a another disgusting piece of gore-cinema, because 99% of this stuff is handmade, I mean faked, and not even good.

You can not kill a man in a gory cult ritual with a pocket knife, neither you cut so easy off his nose. This whole movie stinks. It is just unbearable boring, just a few scenes are a little entertaining as the magican gets ""killed"" in a freak fire, head squashing accident (the fake head is great) and the hostage situation where the guy highly exaggerates his acting ability by far.

But anyway it's just a garbage bag, not entertaining, not really scary and not near as good as it's reputation...

File-it-forget it!

816298,1,6304243391,just like my review title this is garbage it really sucks i thought that these were real scenes of death but it is 110% all fake crap.when i saw it the first time in the year 2000 i could've sworn that it was real but its not it is the most fake crap i've ever watched.if you want real try traces of death or banned from tv.cause i was really disappointed,1066694400,4,355,4.014084507042254
816299,3,6304243391,"Never have cartoons made a better point than in Ren from the Ren and Stimpy show
This film is a rather monotonous look on the morbidity of death. It ain't the prettiest of pictures to watch ( although you kinda know that ). The commentary is like a big joke really. When the presenter tries to look fearsome he looks like a goofball trying to play a psychotic doctor whose "" fascination with the artform "" of death is hilarious. After a half an hour you become numb to the images of death that surround this movie. Weak stomachs are not something you should have watching this movie. And yeah parts of it are fake but even still they do a pretty good job at grossing you out
For those who love this movie - maybe therapy is required!",1060300800,3,733,4.280575539568345
816300,4,6304243391,I Have never Seen any of the previous faces of death films but when i rented Faces of Death 4 I thought it was fantastic except when they showed the sequence with the cute puppy being slaughtred by that family As a dog lover I hope the Animal rights people see this and raise (...) about it,1008028800,7,290,4.105263157894737
816301,5,6304243391,"When I played this film, I thought I was going to be fooled like the other Faces of Death (1-2), 3 and 4 were actually worth a watch of how cruel this world can be. This is probably the sickest films I have ever seen. There contains so much blood,and violence, you wonder why they even made this film? The ending is the best, don't miss that. Sometimes it draggs the movie, but it's great! I was so scared, and closed my eyes at some parts. The Drawn and Quartering was very shocking! This film is for the gore hounds, and get this one, not the first 2.

816303,2,6304243391,"This movie is so fake it's actually a comedy. 95% of this isfake.  The fake stuff looks like it should be on SNL.  I could make abetter looking video.  It is so obvious that it looks like a movie than they skip and show a dummy.  If you're looking for a good laugh get this, but if you want good accident and death footage get banned from TV.

7865738,5,6304243391,"This part can be a little cheesy at times but it is probably my fav after the original. (Best scene) When police agents raid a house thinking the people inside are selling drugs, and what they find is astounding. The culprits are actually Devil worshippers selling human heads to other satanic cults for sacrificial purposes. The agents find a video tape and it shows some of the cland horrendous murders that they have committed. There are some other good parts to. I don't know why but I really like this part of the quadrilogy.",1316736000,,530,4.648936170212766

The husband and wife execution, the massacre in the devil worshipping house, but the scene with the puppies i have not watched. As an animal lover, i will not put myself through that. The scene of the magician getting the bunch of knives straight through his face is so fake. The color of his skin before and after the act is so different if you slow forward it. I can take a lot of horrific stuff on film, but this is my limit.",1313452800,,494,4.15625
