1420945,5,B00005B6JP,"My favorite segments from THE RED GREEN SHOW (do a Google!) have always been HANDYMAN'S CORNER, in which Red takes junk items from around the lot and converts them into a moneysaving project, always using rolls and rolls of ""the handyman's secret weapon: Duct tape."" DUCT TAPE VIRTUOSO DELUXE is a collection of more than a dozen of those segments, in which Red builds (among other things) a front loader from a Lincoln towncar; an Airstream camper from two rowboats; a pontoon boat from a recliner and HVAC ventilation; a drag racer from a lawn mower, a ladder, a broken chair, and a bike; and a stretch-SUV from... well, you get the idea.
RED GREEN is one of my favorite shows --I love the subtle, inventive humor-- and I've always wanted a collection of these segments. They're the ones I'd mention most often when I'd ask people ""Have you ever seen THE RED GREEN SHOW?"" and then I'd stumble trying to explain how funny it was when Red not only cobbled these projects together, but then actually made them WORK. Now, I can just show them the DVD.
A great collection that hasn't gotten any less funny with repeated viewing, and a great introduction to anyone who's ever wondered what this show is about.",1083628800,27,1205,4.635514018691588

1420967,5,B00005B6JP,"Just when you thought everything has been said, done, and joked about with the use of Duct Tape, along comes Red Green.  He's been Duct Taping all his life and you can't imagine anything more ridiculous than the demonstrations on this DVD.

Yes, there is ""The Jumbo Duct Tape Book"" and ""The Duct Tape Bible"" and ""Ductigami: The Art of the Tape"" (all good) but nothing quite expands your imagination with duct tape like ""Red Green, DVD Duct tape Virtuoso Deluxe.""  This DVD includes not only the classic Red Green Show duct tape spectaculars, but also some never-before-seen moments.  It's not to be missed.

SUGGESTION: Duct tape yourself to your seat while viewing, so you don't end up falling out of the chair laughing.  It's that funny.

My wife and I laughed through the approximate 64 promised minutes but the uses of Red Green's ""Handy Man's Secret Weapon"" (duct tape) ended up being nearly an additional 2 hours as we watched extras and backed up to review some of the outrageous Red Green (Steve Smith) creations using duct tape. Each ends up with the classic line ""If women don't find you handsome--they should at least find you handy.""  Even a beer cellar was created from used duct tape cores.  See it to believe it.

X-tras include ""The Spokane Word"", ""Making it with duck tape"" (fabulous gifts made by fans and sent to the show), ""Photo Evidence"", ""No Gainesville No Painesville"", ""Duct Tape Tour"" (3M factory in London, Ontario lead by Red Green), and our favorites ""Behind the Screams"" which includes the options of Scene or Unscene.  This segment includes Car Clean Out, Siphon Hose Cooler, Riverboat Paddlewheeler, Lawnmower Dragster, Flying Bridge,  Air Boat, and Lawn Roller.  Red Green's (Steve Smith) comments are a great addition and adds enjoyment to re-watching the scenes so use the ""Unscene"" option prior to the ""Scene"" option.

Here's a gift idea for the entire male population, although women will like it as well.  Duck tape humor at its absolute finest.

Want to save bucks that can be spent on rolls and rolls of duct tape? Get this DVD and 3 others in the new box set titled ""Red Green is Special"". There is more duct tape fun in each of them, as well as hours of side-splitting humor of all kinds.  All clean, well except for explosions, and fires, and well, all of the mishaps that Red Green causes.  If he can't mess up a job, some of his Possum Lodge friends can.

Highly recommended if you enjoy laughing.",1242000000,9,2442,4.716981132075472
