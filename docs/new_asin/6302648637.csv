I swear, I've not met many people who have actually seen ""Danger UXB."" But those, maybe like me, who's whole family would wait with  eager anticipation each week for the next episode to come on, speak so  highly of it that you would think that it ranked with the classics  ""Upstairs Downstairs"" and ""The Jewel in the  Crown.""
""Danger UXB!,"" they'd say. ""That series is SO  wonderful!! Don't you remember how you felt knowing that your favorite  character whom you'd just spent three episodes growing to love might be  taking the last step of defusing the Nazi's horrible invention of an  'unexploded bomb' where the fuse is designed to detonate as it is being  removed and you don't know if that next moment will be their  last!""
This series is like the video equivalent of a ""page  turner.""",940032000,,855,4.633333333333334
