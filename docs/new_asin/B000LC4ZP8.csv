2702897,4,B000LC4ZP8,"After viewing all four seasons of Doctor Finlay on DVD, I was left with two essential impressions (one positive, one negative), the first being that it was an immensely enjoyable, yet often grim, drama with terrific acting and an interesting historical milieu. I was sorry to see the series end.

My second impression was that the propaganda for a nationalized healthcare system (for which Doctor Finlay was the voice) and for women's rights/health issues (for which Dr. Napier was the voice) was a bit off-putting.  Just too bloomin' blatant.",1380672000,,543,5.089887640449438
2702898,5,B000LC4ZP8,"Doctor Finlay is a delightful show dealing with the Scotish doctor, his mentor, and the people they come into contact with.  Season 3 continues the story.  Each episode can stand alone yet they are connected.  It is a wonderful program, the only criticism I have is the disk does not have closed captioning and understanding the accents is often difficult.",1379548800,4,356,4.9
2702899,5,B000LC4ZP8,"I own all 4 seasons of ""Doctor Finlay"" and enjoy them more than I can say. My one gripe with season 4 is the lousy ending. I really think it kinda stinks,,,,,,that said, I LOVE the Doctor Finlay music theme and
If you love the Scots then you will love this wonderful and thoughtful series.",1241136000,9,289,4.2727272727272725
2702900,5,B000LC4ZP8,"For fans of the Dr. Finlay series, this is season four and I think it is the last set of dvds.  This set is even better than the previous episodes.

There is a Christmas Special sequel to season four but it is not included on these dvds so hopefully that will be made available soon.

This is a series that I hated to see come to an end.",1186704000,20,337,3.926470588235294

8161097,4,B000LC4ZP8,"The Dr. Finlay series is a remake of a much earlier series on Scottish television, and has different actors. The stories are of a country town Dr.. Sometimes a character will speak in either a Highland brogue, or Glasgow slang. I can understand if people, who are unfamiliar with the dialects, loosing a little part of the story. This is not a generalization of the whole series just some individual stories.",1382745600,2,408,4.76056338028169
