7857435,4,6303945708,"Of David Bradley's relatively short career as an action hero, ""Hard Justice"" is probably his most action-packed vehicle outside of his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Ninja/dp/B000AYEL38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Ninja</a>&nbsp;forays. On one hand, it's an uneven and unrealistic cop-in-prison movie, but on the other, it's a surprisingly ambitious adrenaline picture with some of the better production values of the DTV scene.

The story: Following a disastrous bust on a smuggling ring, ATF agent Nick Adams (Bradley) goes undercover in a prison run by corrupt warden (Charles Napier,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Silence-of-the-Lambs/dp/B000LP6KNU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Silence of the Lambs</a>) to investigate the murder of a fellow agent.

At its best, the movie looks like a theatrical production. It manages some impressively-sized action pieces, including two helicopter scenes, and director Greg Yaitanes (Emmy winner for his work on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-M-D/dp/B008P9M614/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House, M.D.</a>) occasionally elevates the production quality to respectable levels. Then, inexplicably, he lets it fall again. From out of nowhere come amateurish zoom shots and unnecessary slow motion, reminding you that this is indeed just a DTV film. Nevertheless, if you're used to low-budget action, the high points still manage to impress - just don't compare it to larger films.

Actually, it's impossible not to compare this one to others, since a good deal of the action is directly lifted from John Woo's flicks - specifically&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hard-Boiled/dp/B000N4SHNK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hard Boiled</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hard-Target/dp/0783227892/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hard Target</a>. (Is it coincidence that this one has ""Hard"" in its title, too?) The film opens with an explosive shootout that's very similar to the hangar scene in the former film, and close to the end, Bradley and Napier shoot at each other from the opposite sides of a prison cell - much like Van Damme and Arnold Vosloo in the latter. Despite the virtual plagiarism, David Bradley is a surprisingly adept at this kind of action: he appears as comfortable with guns as he does with karate, and does a good job of jumping and rolling around with twin pistols blazing. However, these gunfights merely bookend the picture, and the majority of the action is made up of fistfights. These brawls aren't bad and give Yuji Okumoto (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Karate-Kid-II/dp/B00005JXY3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Karate Kid II</a>) a chance to show off, but they're just not as exciting as the gunplay.

The movie sort of reminds me of Van Damme's own prison movie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Warrant/dp/B0000542CC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Warrant</a>: you see plenty of colorful characters and there's a great deal of corruption, but there are no rape scenes (thank goodness) and the prisoners only seem to be properly incarcerated when convenience requires it. Oh well. Dramatically, Jack Napier's presence and charisma makes up for the deficiencies of some of the supporting cast, and Bradley is on his best behavior as an actor. Combined with the film's other strong points, it adds up to four stars. Not the most enthusiastic four stars, but well-earned ones nonetheless. If you're only going to see one David Bradley vehicle, let it be this spotty little gem.",1257120000,2,3784,6.70061099796334

I find myself watching this video again and again because of the action.  It is  definitely a video to add to your library if you are an action fan.",955065600,2,288,4.181818181818182
