8322412,5,B001MYIPNW,"I rented this when I first purchased a VCR, back in the mid-1980s and have viewed it several times since. It does a great job in telling the story of Mr. Churchill's extraordinary life, with a bit of flair, by narrator Orson Wells.",1443916800,,231,4.395348837209302
8322413,4,B001MYIPNW,"Very interesting, if somewhat frustratingly limited documentary biography
of Winston Churchill. It's not really the film's fault. It's well made and intelligent.
It's just that Churchill lived such a full and fascinating life, that trying to jam
it all into an under 2 hour film means that much has to be ignored or sped through.

So in most areas we get the condensed version. Only the war years get a little
more detail. But we get almost nothing about Churchill the human being, the husband,
the father.

Huge changes in his political career are handled with a few sentences and a couple of images.

Yet I was never bored, and still ended up knowing much more about both Churchill and Britain
in the war years than when I started.

A worthwhile film that spurred me on to learn more.",1322784000,,786,4.633093525179856

This dvd reflects the greatness of this man and I enjoyed it immensely. Highly recommended.",1300579200,9,284,4.588235294117647
