8608208,5,B00EPPSCRO,The VHS tapes are perfect for being so old.  No complaints.  I loved the Frog Prince as a child and now mine does too.,1440460800,,118,3.875
8608209,5,B00EPPSCRO,"I was so happy to find these.  I wish they were available on DVD.  Both are charming retellings of classic fairy tales, and both feature my favorite frog as narrator.  Many of the lines from these became sayings in our family decades ago, like ""Never kiss a frog, Melora.  You'll get warts on your lips.""  And ""What does this nose remind you of?""  ""A radish!""  So quotable, and so funny.",1431129600,,387,4.442857142857143
