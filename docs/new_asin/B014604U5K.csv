7384037,4,B014604U5K,"I really wanted to absolutely love this movie, but there were a few things about it that really brought it down a star for me.

It's DBZ and the plot line probably would have been better served in a series of episodes, versus being condensed down into ~2 hours. That may be were most of the failings, at least for me, came from.

First off I will start with the things I liked about the movie. I thought the animation and the choreography for the fights was very good. It also contained many scenes that made me laugh out loud, probably in an obnoxious way. You can really tell that they are trying to get a little bit of the DragonBall humor feel in the new installments in the DB universe. (I've only gotten to watch the first episode of DB Super at this point, trying to rewatch all of DBZ first, but it seemed they were trying to up the humor in that as well). I don't really want to say too much to give away story or anything and overall I felt that the plot could have worked if some minor changes had been made. All in all, the action is right up the DBZ alley, the animation is top notch, and it was very funny.

Now my gripes. I was debating whether these would take two stars or only a single star and though I think these things really hurt the movie I did still enjoy it, so that's why I'm giving it four stars, though if I were to be absolutely honest it would probably be 3.5 stars.

The biggest issue is there are some really interesting promises that I felt were given in act 1 of the movie that were not delivered by the end of the movie. I also felt that the absence of some characters during the large fight before Goku and Vegeta show up was ridiculous. This is in the trailer, so I won't count it as a spoiler, but Roshi being present while others are not is just ridiculous. Roshi hasn't been a relevant fighter since DragonBall and Freiza's men, even the weak ones, should have been much stronger than Roshi. It was just hard from me to believe that he could fight all of those men the way he did in the movie. It was hard to suspend my disbelief for that portion, especially with some of the much much stronger characters being a no show. My biggest gripe, besides the promises that weren't fulfilled is that this movie has a very ridiculous Deus Ex Machina moment that I just felt it didn't need to use. This felt like cheap and lazy writing to me, especially because I could easily see a much more satisfying ending. I can't really comment on what I thought would be a better ending without spoiling the movie, so I won't.

I hope this helps you to be prepared. All in all, I would recommend seeing this movie if you are a DBZ fan, but be prepared for some let downs in the plot elements.",1440547200,4,2715,4.213461538461538
7384038,3,B014604U5K,"As a Dragon Ball fan who's seen the Dragon Ball films 1-4, Dragon Ball Z films 1-13 and all the rest I have to say that Resurrection F came off as rather very disappointing of a Dragon Ball Z movie. The villain is Freeza whom we already knew before and so basically he powers up, tries to defeat the Saiyans and fails then becomes the Golden Freeza which ultimately doesn't make much difference considering he still gets beaten down.

Freeza as it stands now is merely a punching bag rather than a real threat any more so in comparison to other DBZ movie villains and plot-wise (it went straight to beat the bad dudes and that's it) Resurrection F wasn't very good as an entertaining film, yet, I'll happily admit that it's watchable so it's not terribad by any means. Let's not forget about the FUNimation dub for the English markets, it's fairly obvious the FUNimation cast has went in great detail to make a spectacular dub so if you happen to dislike the movie then the dub will be there to make it tolerable.

Lastly, as the product cover shows Goku turns to a blue Saiyan which in official terms is ""Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan"" and he's not the only one as Vegeta too became a blue haired Saiyan. Still, Vegeta never became a Super Saiyan God (red hair Saiyan) so it came as a surprise that he managed it. Was this impressive? Honestly, no.

Now, I'm not trying to be pessimistic but I just didn't enjoy it the movie still a lot of folks out there did so more power to them. I'll rather just stick to Dead Zone, World's Strongest, Tree of Might, Fusion Reborn and Wrath of the Dragon.",1440460800,5,1593,4.41156462585034

7384043,5,B014604U5K,"First a quick description of the show: Frieza is revived by the remnants of his army. He retreats back to his planet to train for months in preparation to exact his revenge against the Saiyans. Upon completion of his training, he brings the entirety of his army and invades Earth. This movie is so action packed from beginning to end and I'm so glad I watched this in theater. Just being there in the movie theater with all the DBZ fans cheering and cracking up was just a wonderful experience. The fight scene, music, and animation just went above and beyond my expectation.

I think the best aspect of this movie was when all the original DBZ characters got to show off their skills. Everyone from Master Roshi to Jaco the Galactic Patrolman had important and hilarious moments in this show. Without spoiling anything, a situation occurs in the show where the group divides up people to fight and they all showed their best skills. It wasn't one of those SPECIAL BEAM CANNON and then on to the next character kind of scenes. They all had a good amount of time spent on their fighting scenes and it's probably one of the best fan service moments I've ever seen. Even Vegeta, who is always being shown up by Goku, had really cool moments.

The movie kept along at a relaxed pace in the beginning, but definitely revved up at the end. You know in some fight scenes, they usually have those swift blurred lines with people throwing punches that symbolizes that they are throwing dozens of them. Well, it's not there anymore. They slowed down the punches and really shows you the detail and strength behind them. If there is one thing I would nitpick about this movie, it would be that there was basically no major develop. In the previous movie, ""Battle Of The Gods"", you get to discover Beerus who brings power levels to a whole new ballgame, you see a new transformation of Super Saiyan, and it developed the plot and let you know that there are much stronger people out in the universe. But for this movie, there wasn't any huge developments. I think it was more of an homage to Frieza, the final sendoff to a great DBZ character, and I'm ok with that.

I honestly can't say enough good things about this movie, to me it was damn near perfect. Give it a chance, you won't regret it!

I never really liked Frieza in Z but after all of this I definitely like the character a lot more especially for the sub. This movie is basically the introduction of SSGSS Goku and Golden Frieza. Something really stupid happens to Goku near the end that almost killed the entire movie for me. And why can't Vegeta ever be the best?

7384053,2,B014604U5K,"I love Dragonball Z but this this movie was just stupid. Frieza was arguably the best Villain in dbz, but bringing him back in this way was just an attempt at playing at fanboy nostalgia. It wasn't very interesting or threatening of an idea because Goku and the gang have fought enemies many millions of times stronger than Frieza since then.

I never got the feeling that Frieza was much of a threat in this movie. Even with his new powers, Goku and Vegeta were pretty much in control of the situation the whole time. There was no real tension. That is the biggest problem with this movie to me. There were no real stakes and Friezas plan was stupid and deeply flawed.

The fights were ok, I guess, but the most interesting stuff to me was the z fighters taking on Friezas army before Goku arrived.

The only part of this movie I can really praise are the visuals. The characters and backgrounds look great.... thats all.

If you're a hardcore dbz fan, I would recommend renting it, watching it once, and forgetting about it.",1512691200,,1026,4.5

7384060,4,B014604U5K,"I'm not sure if I like this better than Battle of Gods. As a whole, I've gotta say BoG was better, but I still enjoyed this movie. Let me explain...

Pros:
-We get to see Freiza return in his new golden form.
-Rematch between Goku and Freiza.
-More Beerus and Whis.
-My favorite part, seeing the lesser used Z fighters actually get to kick some ass against countless Freiza Force baddies. Piccolo, Krillen, Tien, Gohan, and....wait for it....MASTER ROSHI! That's right. The old Turtle Hermit goes buff and starts wrecking dudes out of nowhere. I wasn't expecting it, and although the whole power level thing is questionable (who really cares at this point?), it was so awesome to see him in fighting form again.
-Action sequences were great.

Cons:
-Plot is pretty bland and predictable.
-Golden Freiza kinda gets his ass kicked. It never seems like Goku is going to lose at all.
-As usual, too much Goku. Even Vegita has a hard time getting in on the action.
-I'd like to have seen some more of the Z fighter battle honestly. Maybe more of them working together, Avengers style (you know what I'm talking about). Their fight was so refreshing that I kinda checked out once Goku started beating down Freiza.

Anyway, yeah, watch this one. There's some good fan service in here.",1507852800,,1277,4.691964285714286

The film deals with Goku, Vegeta, Jaco the Galactic Patrolman, and the other characters getting drawn into a situation that they are pretty much forced to partake in when Frieza becomes involved.

7384086,5,B014604U5K,"-A love letter from Akira Toriyama-

_Resurrection F_ is the film the _Dragon Ball_ fandom has been waiting for. Taking place after 2013s _Battle of Gods_, this film has all of the action and mayhem that the franchise is known for. In a first for the series, the film has an underlying focus on Goku and Vegeta's character flaws rather than simply becoming stronger and beating the bad guy.

Toriyama stated that the film would be utterly hilarious and he wasn't lying. This is the most fun Ive had watching something in the series for a very long time. Combined with an amazing fight that spans over half the film and actual character development for Goku, this is the film everyone wanted the rather disappointing _Battle of Gods_ to be. Whereas that film spent most of its time with slice of life pieces and Vegeta trying to keep Beerus from getting angry only to have a ten minute fight between Goku and Beerus in the end, _Resurrection F_ wastes no time getting to business. It must be noted though that this film borders on being a parody of itself due to the type of humor in it and a scene where Freeza himself is terrified instead of terrifying due to seeing Beerus a few feet away from him. It isn't bad, this film lacks the threatening tone or mood that the series had back when everyone was on Namek, and Freeza himself is more comical than threatening.

While this film has everything a fan has wanted in a new film, there *are* a few drawbacks. In a number of scenes the animation is noticeably less than stellar instead of buttery smooth, and there are two or three CGI scenes that are cringe worthy due to their simplicity. The ending is also a bit abrupt with the epilogue being around only two minutes long. Most importantly, many fans' favorite characters such as Yamcha, Trunks, Goten, Chiaotzu, Mr. Satan and Majin Buu do not make any appearances. Android 18 has a few small lines in the beginning before focus shifts to Krillin, Master Roshi, Gohan, Piccolo, Tien Shinhan, Bulma, and Frieza.

Despite its drawbacks this is the film that fans of the franchise want and will leave with their fists in the air while talking about their hero, Goku, and the amazing fight between the most evil villain of their childhood making a stupendous theatrical appearance with the latest standards in animation and a great soundtrack to boot as they watch a fierce battle just like in the old days.",1490659200,,2406,4.614485981308412

The ultimate rematch between Frieza vs. Goku is basically what I remember about this show: action-packed fighting with power moves like the classic Kamehamaha wave!  Kick my nostalgia into overdrive!

Dragon Ball Super has a few minor changes compared to this movie: more screen time with Tagoma, return of a certain Ginyu Force member, shorter pacing time, and mediocre animation quality.

I admit it's not the best movie out of the franchise but I enjoy watching my favorite DBZ fighters again!",1484265600,,545,4.956043956043956

The plot is good, I have nothing to complain about. The message that Whis gives Vegeta and Goku is solid gold, and in fact, can easily be relatable to many of us. The animation was amazing, the sound effects were amazing, the dialog is great. As far as the battles, the Z fighters held their own pretty well. It was exciting! Frieza didn't stand a chance, really. Goku and Vegeta pinpointed his weakness at the same time and took advantage of it. I'm okay with that. While I wish Vegeta wasted Freiza, the decision to let Freiza...okay, I won't kill the story for those who haven't watched it. Check it out, you'll enjoy it.",1480982400,,767,4.408450704225352

Resurrection F brings back possibly the best villain of the series in Frieza who of course goes to Earth to get revenge on Goku.  The movie also puts other heroes in action like Krillin, Piccolo, Tien, Gohan, and even Master Roshi.  Its a fun time all around full of nostalgia that hardcore DBZ fans won't be disappointed in.

The fighting between Goku and Frieza was outstanding.  I would have liked to have seen more Vegata and Frieza fighting action.  Also, I thought Gohan was under utilized in the movie.  Not in comparison to the TV show where he was a lot more active and showing his abilities. I think they could have made some of the fight scenes longer.

I enjoyed feeling like a kid again while experiencing a brand new story from an anime that will always have a place in my heart. Same voices as the original series dub voice actors, except for Frieza, but the voice is for Frieza is still pretty decent.

like seriously? Gohan having a hard time clearing those goons? Even if he didn't fight for 20 years he still could nuke all those goons just liek tien or whatever his name is getting tired....seriously.

7384356,5,B014604U5K,Amazing movie. A must have for anyone who enjoys Dragonball.,1456099200,,60,5.1
7384357,5,B014604U5K,"A great return to form for Dragonball Z, along with Battle of Gods. If you wished for more action after the battle light Battle of Gods (although I didn't mind it so much), then Resurrection F should deliver for you. A good majority of the film is action heavy, as Goku and the gang try to stop the newly revived Freiza and his army. If you were hoping for more humor, it is still here, just not on the level BoG. Beerus and Weiss return, as you might have noticed them on this movies box art, but they are not featured as prominently here. They are just as funny when they do appear on screen, and ultimately, I am glad the creators liked them enough to make them returning characters. But anyways this movie isn't about them it is about Freiza. This movie is on the same level as the original Frieza arc in DBZ, just a whole lot more condensed. No waiting several episodes to wait for Goku to power up a move *cough* Spirit Bomb *cough*. Hahaha, I kid, I kid.

This movie should scratch the itch of anyone looking for an action heavy DBZ, and those who just want to relive those good old days of coming home from school, turning on the TV, and zoning out to a great  episode of DBZ, but in a new light. This is truly DBZ the way you remember, just a little bit fresher and in stunning HD!",1456099200,,1290,4.19758064516129
7384358,3,B014604U5K,"I rented this because I found a can of Surge at a gas station and the nostalgia overcame all sense of reason. I bought the Surge, popped in 'Among the Living' on my way home, and continued my journey through the past with a rental of the most recent DBZ movie on offer.

The entire thing felt incredibly rushed. One of the things I hated as a kid was how long it took to get to the point. How many episodes did Goku spend charging that damned spirit bomb before inevitably smacking Frieza in the face with it? How long did we have to wait for his training capsule to even get to Namek while we watched all those b-roll characters dancing with each other? This was my least favorite feature of the series when I was younger, but over time it's what I came to expect and even begrudgingly love about my afternoons after school. ""Is he finally going to launch the attack today?! .... Oh never mind, this episode is about the Ginyu Force again for some reason.""

This movie has absolutely no build up whatsoever. It's just 'Frieza is resurrected, now he's at Earth, and now everyone is getting wrecked.... b... but wait! Goku/Space Jesus just unlocked another cheap trick/new power level and the day is saved!' Battle of Gods (which I will review as well) suffered from the same problem, but not nearly as seriously.

That said I was still entertained. The new characters are wonderful and I love the way they are written (Beerus and Whis are easily my new favorites). The old characters are still just as I remember them, but I hate that they keep bringing Frieza back. The animation quality was also very, very good. I went back and watched some clips from the older movies and series and they are definitely showing their age.

I honestly took one star off because Krillin started out with hair. Just no. Never. I have no clue what any of these characters were like in the Manga because I got picked on enough for liking the Anime, so if he had it there I apologize for not being a big enough fanboy, but I grew up with Krillin being the butt of every bald joke in the universe.",1455926400,,2077,4.415143603133159

7384461,1,B014604U5K,"This belongs on the ""How did this get made?"" Podcast.  Seriously, I am a hardcore Dragon Ball Z fan and have been for years.  I lived in Japan and hunted down any kind of unique book or product I could find, including cell phone charms, , and the daizenshuu's.

Think about it people, this movie came out when like last year?  And Dragon Ball Z ended when?  Well the source material ended in the mid 90's.  That's 20 or so years plus or minus a couple!  I wasn't even a fan of the Majin Buu saga where I and others felt that the creator was either toying with us, or his editing team lost all control for good writing.  Nothing against Mr. Toriyama or his works, but he's been divorced from his series for so long he's forgotten a lot of the things he'd done with the characters and it makes for inconsistencies.

The first 1/4 of the movie is actually good!  After that, it goes back into the boring invincible Goku and Vegeta who are the only ones who can do anything.  This movie is pandering to the lowest common denominator in the worst way.  As far as material goes, we've already explored Goku and Vegeta to the fullest, there's nothing else there worth doing, as characters, their arc and development is done.

It's so recycled too, instead of doing anything new or different, we bring back an old enemy (Freeza) and basically re-do the battle on Namek but on earth with almost the same beats (drama term).  Plus, the blue haired thing?  Super-Saiyan God - Super Saiyan?  REALLY?!

Raise your hand if you think we're being toyed with, I mean seriously.  Instead of doing something more interesting like having the characters take on this reborn Freeza in a melee where it's Freeza vs. team earth, it's ""only Goku and Vegeta can take Freeza on, BUT NOT AT THE SAME TIME!  All fights MUST be conducted in a one-on-one manner.""

This is the biggest problem that comes with what happens when something becomes REALLY successful.  At first when the product is pretty unknown or isn't the giant cash cow yet, the creative influence can still be told ""Nah, that sounds ridiculous, what if (blank) were to happen instead?"" or something like that.  Once it's the mega success then you can't possibly question the genius talent!  Well yes the source is just that, but that's not to say the source is infallible or that the only good ideas come from there, or can't be questioned.",1451174400,,2377,4.541176470588235

7384472,5,B014604U5K,"Just finished watching ""Dragonball Z - Resurrection F"" released by Funimation.
Spoiler Alert:  Frieza has been wished back from Purgatory by the remnants of his battered army who hope his return will turn the tide of battle in their favor.  Only Frieza has other plans.  Having enduring years of agonizing hell in Purgatory having to watch and listen to angels, fairys, and stuffed animals dance and sing joyfully, he's out for revenge on Goku and he plans to destroy the Earth in the process.  Of course, Frieza also wants to kill all of Goku's family and friends before destroying the planet just to make Goku suffer.
Frieza isn't a subtle villain.  He wants to inflict revenge before resuming the war to become ruler of the known universe.
Unfortunately for Frieza, Goku and Vegeta are off learning new combat techniques.  Unfortunately for everyone on Earth, Goku and Vegeta might not get back in time to save the day.
Great Dragonball Z action and the spell binding return of one of the nastiest villains in anime.
Great Fun!

I will admit, the visual appeal is quite nice, however, the plot is still old-school DBZ.  You don't get anything new from the old epsiodal formula of story progression.  That isn't entirely bad. It will remind you of the show you grew to love, but they don't break new ground on what you have been watching over the last 270+ episodes and dozen and a half movies.

In addition to becoming relatively weak, he also looked weird.  I know his sense of style is supposed to be...lacking, but the tracksuit look didn't work for him.
Freeza was great (or at least he was with what little time we saw him), and I LOVED his version of hell.  It seemed a very fitting eternal punishment for him.
I also enjoy how Jaco was worked into the movie.
The voice acting was pretty great, and the animation was also very polished.

7384519,5,B014604U5K,"{I consider myself a pretty big DB fan, been with it since Goku met Bulma and EVERYTHING after that.}
 Firstly if you're going to compare this film to other DBZ films from the past (1-13) know that all of the first 13 DBZ films are Not canon, meaning that the mastermind & series creator Mr. Akira Toriyama had nothing to do with them. So people saying that resurrection doesn't hold up with the standards of previous movies are absolutely right, because all of the other movies are not based on actual Dragonball(Z) manga. With that being said, if you're one of those people that see something non conon and say "" OH ITS NOT CANON HURR DURR ITS GARBAGE!"" please STFU Forever.
I personally love all of the non canon Dragonball stuff, I love all of the movies especially Lord Slug and I love the non canon GT series. Non canon simply means that it isn't based on the original storyline, but that doesn't mean that its bad, its still DB just very slightly different in some small aspects. Non canon content is pretty much parallel with the canon DB universe so I really don't  undersrand why some people don't like it.

Secondly, yes the story in resurrection could have had a bit more to it but its not bad or anything. I'd rather them focus on the fights and the characters actually living in the moment, rather than have goku thinking about how/ why he's going to win for a whole episode and powering up with heavy dialogue for a whole episode. I know its a movie but you get my point.

Finally the combat itself is fast paced classic FSU awesome sauce. All of the Z fighters showcase their skills in this film, even the turtle hermit.

Also to the moron saying that they changed Bulma and Gohan's appearance; if you haven't noticed all the characters except master roshi and Tien have a very slight almost unnoticable change in appearance and its because of aging. I'm sorry if you expected fully grown adult Bulma (who's now a mother mind you) to look exactly the same as she did in dragon ball when she was 16 or in the early seasons of DBZ. GTFO with that nonsense. Even Goku and Vegeta look very slightly different than they did in the anime especially in the early seasons. I'm an illustrator I know what I'm talking about. All of the characters in this film look true to how they should look at this point in time.

And to the idiot saying that Gohan dies from one punch from first form frieza; did you even watch the movie?? He didn't die, he was knocked unconscious at most and immediately healed by a senzu bean.

people saying hes a wimp.
Sure Gohan ""should"" be stronger, but if you know anything about Gohan's life you know that he values mental strength more than physical strength, a value that his mother Chi Chi strongly pushed on him. And there's nothing wrong with that, he's still easily the strongest non-god z fighter.

And holy hell someone actually believes that the DB series is a rip off of Pokemon ARE YOU SERIOUS????? DB was created/ published/ aired in the 80s!
Pokemon wasn't even created til 1996. -_-
Not that they're even really that similar.

All in all this film is great.

7384550,1,B014604U5K,"The Main problem with the last two movies is that they feel rushed and they don't have the same emotions that were attached to the saga and the original movies. For instance during the Cell Games where Gohan and Goku performed the Father son Kamehameha (if you haven't seen it recently look up the video online). Another instance would be during the Android Saga when we see future Trunks and Gohan, where Gohan dies and we see what comes of Trunks. The main issue that I had with this movie was that during the Goku vs Frieza fight, they had to take a moment to notice The Destroyer and attempt a comical moment over the ice cream.

The Saiyan race is supposed to be the most manly testosterone fuled race in the universe. Why in the world they decided to diverge from canon DBZ/GT and make this ""Saiyan God"" form is beyond me. Super Saiyan 4 is the pinnacle of that manly testosterone fuled race known as the Saiyans. Hairy chest, tail, long awesome hair, and those eyes... If we look back to GT, to the fight between Omega Shenron and Goku SS4, that was the as boss as a Saiyan could be.

Gohan was my favorite stonecoldbadass character growing up. He stood toe to toe against Buu, Cell, Android 17, Broly, Baby Vegeta (GT), Garlic Jr. & minions, Turles, Android 13 (GT), Cooler, and that's just a few to start. Gohan in the last few movies has been a tragic disappointment of the highest order.

I know you can figure that out easily. However, from the trailer it always seemed like he would actually catch up to Goku during the film, which would be cool. But they made it so they were equal already. Was kind of hoping for a little more dramatic and difficult fight. Seemed a bit too one-sided.

7384601,5,B014604U5K,"Not surprised I rated it 5 stars. ResurrectionF does not stand as as BattleOfGods but this film is part of the new Dragon SUPER anime series and an abridge gap for the next film. First of all ""Red Haired Flame Super Saiyan God"" does not return as in the 1st film. Goku acquired that by the combined mystic technique of Saiyans to achieve it. Therefore in this film we see a ""Blue Haired"" version of a Super Saiyan God1 that it took both Goku & Vegeta under training by Whiz to reach that level. (You can bet there is a Super Saiyan God2 & 3 mode until ""RedHair4mode"") Which questions into mind how did then Frieza acquire his ""GoldenF1 Gode Mode"" there is no possible way to self train to that level unless you are being trained by an otherworldy ""God"" character like Whis or Beerus (let me point out had mention the existence of other more powerful gods than himself). Also this film is more excitingly unique that for comicbook fans we see a reunion between Bulma and galactic patrolman Jaco whom both have history ties that are linked (spoiler alert) Bulma's older Sister who had a connection (spoiler) Goku's Mother!!!
The Dragonball Z Universe is expanding and beyond with more interesting characters and the history that is linked with our Z Fighters!!!",1447632000,,1259,4.625

Hope the serialized anime comes out better just as with battle of gods barring the animation but still better than movies like fusion reborn and bio broly. Don't know why no other saiyan is improving except for goku and vegeta and once all powerful gohan is just a wasted character, I mean the fights are entertaining as it has been with DBZ but so much potential heroes are just there to witness the all might of the two saiyans.

7384648,2,B014604U5K,"I was pretty disappointed by Resurrection of F, I hate to say it but compared to Battle of the Gods, this movie very much pales.

Let me first say I was upfront disappointed by Amazon splitting the dubbed and subbed versions into different items for sale on their digital store front, pretty shady I must say. :\

Plot: (I will attempt to avoid spoilers)
So Resurrection of F starts out really solid continuing the over arching plot from Battle of the gods. We then get to see the Z fighters doing their respective things while the villains go about trying to bring back Frezia. It's all just getting warmed up when for some reason key characters are just not present for no good reason. Even those mentioned by name aren't brought into the struggle, mostly because it would be too hard to explain why they couldn't win, I'd guess?
So, you guessed it, it degrades into a ""Goku and Vegeta save the day, but actually just Goku"" scenario.
Even Piccalo is denied his standard issue one good fight in favor of super saiyan.
So once again characters take a back seat to Saiyans, even though it doesn't entirely make sense.
Then the ending ends up not really making good on any of the build up and just kinda comes off shallow, after seeing villains of depth in the previous movie I had really hoped they were going to give Frezia some growth, but from start to finish, they are just as one dimensional as ever, I fell like it was a really lost opportunity to show us the back story or perhaps hidden motivations of a character so central to the series.

Animation:
Ok this varies wildly, some times the animation looks incredible, excellent detail, good lines and excellent color.
Then other times it's PAINFULLY obvious that they are using 3D models as the characters move with no momentum or heft, no weight at all and just look like a model being rotated. It looks the worse when the characters are in the foreground moving toward the ""camera"" and you can see Goku just rotate into position as though he has no mass at all. The choice of colors to show the new ""power level"" of Goku and Vegeta is interesting but without the iconic golden hair it just feels....wrong or off some how, I feel like adding an effect like a pulsing glow would have been better but that's just personal preference. Though it is used very interestingly in combination with Vegeta's appearance...though you only really see it for a few moments before ""Goku Savior""
However by far the WORST example of the animation in this film is Gohan, WHAT THE DEVIL!
It was like someone lost Gohan's character sheet and decided to just do it from memory. His jawline is all wrong, his eyes are too far apart, legs and arms aren't the correct length, wrong just all wrong and all over the place...maybe it's because he has a lot of his muscle mass? It just looks so jarring and off putting, I desperately hoped Piccalo was going to zap him with his ""clothing beam.""

I struggled on what rating to give this, but I can tell you it doesn't go above 3 stars. After Battle of the Gods, I've seen they are capible of better and that was what I expected. I hope the 3rd film will be awesome though, I'm still looking forward to it.",1446940800,,3184,4.493955094991365

7384660,4,B014604U5K,"I never considered myself to be a huge DBZ fan and it's mainly because I felt the show itself was way too long for its own good. At the same time, it had a nasty habit to regurgitate its formula way too often, and as it went on the villains and even the characters motivations became quite stale. However, there was one character, a villain, that I never seemed to forget and I always regarded him to be my favorite, and that villain was Frieza. As time went on, people simply forgot about him because he wasn't the strongest threat any longer; but what made Frieza special to me was his overall connection with the Saiyans. No one terrorized and brought more misery to them than Frieza. He was the ultimate threat especially on a personal level. Dragonball Z: Resurrection F, brings the character back to life, and this was the one DBZ movie I just had to see. For the most part I wasn't disappointed.

The story begins with Frieza being resurrected by his men with hopes that he would lead them once again. Frieza has something else on his mind and that's revenge against Goku for defeating him and Trunks for killing him. He learns that Goku has gotten much stronger, thus understands fighting him at the moment makes no sense. He then leaves to train on his own and come back stronger.

I have to say that this movie kept me greatly entertained for many reasons. One element that stood out to me immediately was the character designs and animation. There's a fresh, clean like feel to the character designs with everything feeling updated. Characters like Roshi and even Gohan in his silly jumpsuit look strong and confident. Plus I liked the change in outfits for Bulma, and the small details added to Goku's uniform. It all feels up to date and right for this movie.

The animation is by far a huge step up. The meshing of CG with 2D & 3D graphics was done a lot better this time than the last movie. Characters in the background had some nice life to them and nothing came off awkward. The action was simply amazing as it focused on the characters martial arts backgrounds, this area could have been a whole helluva lot better had more characters taken part in the fighting, but I was still satisfied to see some really quick strikes, strong blows, and various kung-fu styles thrown in with the punches. Even if some one comes away hating this movie for other things; they will have to admit that for a DBZ movie the action is tight. The animation was done really well for the energy blasting spectacles.

DBZ almost always rules with its ear blistering soundtracks. While this movie may not be on par with Cooler's Revenge or Broly: The Legendary Super Saiyan. It definitely gets the job done not only bringing life to the action but also to character interactions.

One last thing that definitely brought a smile to me had to be the focus on Goku and Frieza's rivalry, along with the latter's overall hatred not only for Goku, but also his experience with the Super Saiyan itself. This is where the dialog comes off very strong, as Frieza is truly obsessed by this point, and it puts his blood feud with the Saiyans in perspective; I think this added to the drama a good deal, and the handling of drama is not something DBZ has always been strong on.

I enjoyed this movie a whole lot but I did have to watch it twice because the first viewing left me very uneasy. It just so happened that Akira Toriyama decided to completely ignore previously established story elements that he himself put into play. There are continuity issues in this movie big enough to fit planets through and it's just a shame because the story could have been so much better had everything been told properly. These things also hurt previous character development and lessens them as characters. I mean who would think that Frieza was such a slacker that he never trained? It's hard to buy into that considering how seriously Frieza took himself. I also straight up didn't like the ending, because I'm long tired of Vegeta getting screwed over.

Overall, this is definitely something fans should come into expecting it to be good. The updated animation, action scenes, and focus on the feud of classic characters makes this a DBZ movie that should be seen. I can imagine non DBZ fans getting something out of it as well.

Highs: Action, animation, and characters done well

Lows: Complete ignoring of previously established story elements hurts it",1446768000,,4431,4.62007623888183

I'm glad that after all these years since Z and GT ended they are making new movies, not to mention a brand new tv series already going on in Japan called Dragon Ball Super that I HOPE is coming out in America soon, though the first few episodes seem to start off being an alternate version of the Battle of Gods movie.

Of all the STUPID things I've ever read in my life. Calling Dragon Ball a 'ripoff' of POKEMON?!  Next  time check your FACTS on which series is OLDER than the other one before badmouthing one with saying its a ripoff, because if you want to point fingers at WHICH show is the ripoff, then if anything POKEMON is a ripoff of DRAGON BALL, because if you bothered looking it up online, you'd find out that Dragon Ball has been around since 1984, while Pokemon came out THIRTEEN years later in 1997.

Dragon Ball has 13 year SENORITY over Pokemon. So drop the mindset that Dragon Ball, which is the COOLEST aliens and martial arts manga/anime EVER made back in the 80s, is SOMEHOW a bloody RIPOFF of a 90s created series like Pokemon.",1446681600,,1262,4.241666666666666

P.S. i do have some curiosity about two things in these two new DBZ movies. 1. Frieza mentions becoming power level 1.3 million which seems odd considering he was a million in his giant horned tall form back on namek. Shouldnt he mean 1.3 billion? Ok 2. Goku never goes level 4 in Battle of Gods he says 3 is his highest form which clearly oozaroo monkey 4 is the highest saiyan transformation. And why cant God mode be a variant of 4 form instead of reg saiyan form? Im assuming this may mean new transformations to come because these movies answer alot of questions we wondered about before so i assume these questions will get answered in time. Im so excited i cant wait :))))),1446681600,,1053,4.27

7384678,3,B014604U5K,"The reality is the film is now being showcased to adults. The original was around 20 years ago. I understand the target audience is more or less the same, but this was clearly rushed, even just compared to Battle of Gods.

Let's break it down.

The positive: The animations are certainly quite crisp and clean. It still feels like old DB:Z, but it's actually grown up in this department. It was a real treat to get to see my favorite anime in such clean form. The music was actually surprisingly enjoyable. I had some chuckles at the selection from time to time, but for the most part, I thought it was actually refreshing. The nostalgia factor was a 10/10. I'm not sure why, but this had me so much more pumped than the last flick. Unfortunately, we need to transition to the negatives already.

The negative: The fact that they wanted to bring back Frieza was great and all, but they just rushed it all far too hard. They could have turned this into an epic movie series, but they tried to cram everything in, and it left Frieza feeling extremely weak. He's only powerful for about 3 minutes of screen time, and even then he's barely a threat. Hell, there's people eating ice cream during the fight. Where's the terror? Where's the pure evil? There's no build up or suspense. ""Let's just go to max form and fight"". Really? Fine, but my screen should not just be trembling for the next 20 minutes, but my heart should be racing as well. There was really none of that. By the time the main show gets you excited, it's practically over.

Conclusion: The film should leave you feeling confused. It's an excellent film in terms of animation and nostalgia, and the power threats are off the charts (I mean, c'mon. They're now deity-level powerful). But it should leave you feeling like you were rushed. It's kind of like eating a brownie that's all moist and delicious, but knowing some mold got into the mix. You can kinda taste it, but it's not enough to stop you from finishing it up.

Is it worth your 4 zennie for HD? Yeah, absolutely. If you're a DB:Z fan, you cannot afford to miss this installment. Should you be disappointed? I think you're being unreasonable if you aren't. Even if you're a kid just coming into the series, you'd be remiss to not sense the rush on this one when compared to the original threat and terror Frieza brought. Any review over 4 is just being dishonest.",1446595200,,2386,4.513888888888889

7384688,2,B014604U5K,"On the Technical side of things, it's the best Dragonball Z movie produced.  The movie is well made. The picture quality and sound quality is really good.  But the content of movie itself is very disappointing.  I see reviews of people praising the movie but I don't see it.  What was so good about it?  The fights?  Having Freiza back?  Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan?  So let's get into it a bit.

**Spoiler warnings**

Lets take about the fights.  They were awful.  Animation was great (Technical) but Z fighters fighting bland cannon fodder-esque Freiza Men (content) was dull.  The Z fighters have to fight a 1000 of them but who cares, it's a 1000 weaklings.  Would have been way more interesting if Frieza took all of his troops and had them train along with him.  I'd rather see 6 really strong people then 1000 weaklings that take up time in the movie.  Also, the power levels are all off.  Piccolo has a hard time fighting someone who has the power level of Zarbon...  Zarbon.  the guy with the power level of like 30,000+.  What?  Piccolo was able to take on Frieza's 1st transformation.  he was able to take on Android 17.  But now, he has a hard time taking on someone at Zarbon's level???

Freiza being back is an interesting concept but that's more because of nostalgia.

Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan.... I don't even know what to say about it so I'll skip it.  I'll say this.  Dragonball Super should be renamed Dragonball Colors.

**End Spoilers**

The problem with the movie is the content.  It's very low on it and story.  Some people would argue and say Dragonball doesnt need content or story, it just needs fighting.  You are the reason why they gloss over it.

It's a movie suited for the movie theater that is filled with Dragonball fans.  .I don't think its suited as a home entertainment release.

There will be another Dragonball movie in 2016.  I just hope the story is better than Battle of Gods and this movie and that they fix the power levels.",1446508800,,1975,4.542857142857143

Probably gonna get some hate for this from whiny fan boys but I can live with that in the spirit of objectivity. First off, I wanna say that I'm a true DB fan. I've loved the series since it first aired in the US in the early 90s. This idea that a true fan wouldn't criticize something they love is stupid. This is the case for this movie and also Dragon Ball Super. People are all about it simply because Akira Toriyama is onboard, as if he can do no wrong. In my opinion, he's doing the history of this amazing series no justice by putting this kind of thing out. From the start, I was really excited about this movie. The premise was pretty silly but for nostalgia, it was awesome. I actually kind of enjoyed it when I first watched it despite its flaws. It was pretty entertaining if you're not familiar with the past series. It wasn't until I rewatched it that those flaws really started to irritate me and left me with a lot of questions that have no reasonable answers. But I'll ask them anyway.

The power levels in this movie made no sense. How is it that Piccolo, one of the strongest characters of the series, struggled with a guy who was described as being ""As strong as Zarbon and Dodoria at their peak""?? Why did Gohan, the strongest character in the series at the end of the Buu saga, need to go Super Saiyan to one shot him? Why was Freiza in his base form (even with his increased strength) able to one shot Gohan? Where are Goten and Trunks? They didn't feel having two extra Super Saiyans on hand to help fight would tip the odds in their favor? Couldn't they have sensed what was going one even if no one told them? Why is Master Roshi as strong as Krillin? How was Goku taken out by a f*cking ray gun? I don't buy that ""letting your guard down easy"" crap. It was a cheap, lazy plot device that had no place anywhere in the series. No main character in DB has ever been taken out by any kind of gun. So BS on that. And really, how were any of the henchmen a match for anyone other than Master Roshi? Yeah, I get the whole ""don't kill them"" thing making the battle a little more difficult but I don't buy it. What the hell is Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan? And why didn't anyone bring up the fact that not only is it a stupid name for a form, but it's just Super Saiyan with different colors? For that matter, why was Frieza's new form basically the same concept? Why not make it similar to Cooler's fifth form? Anything would have been better than that stupid Gold Frieza crap.

If they're really planning on just making the series more of the same with Vegeta and Goku trying to surpass each other while making everyone else side characters, why not just give Vegeta his time to shine and let him repay Frieza for destroying his entire race and the years of terrible treatment? I feel like this series has gotten super repetitive with Goku always having to save the day at the end. With Gohan, they wasted an amazingly powerful character who could have at least remained on par with Goku and Vegeta. With Goten and Trunks, they have characters whose stories could just be starting to unfold. It doesn't have to be about Goku and Vegeta becoming stronger. We've already seen that. How is the 18-22 year old Gohan's story complete to the point where he has no major role in anything anymore? If you're not gonna let Goten and Trunks shine in this series, why not give them their own spinoff? We're talking writing and story creation here, not individual characters' motivation because it's the creators who decide those things.

Anyway, my point is that this movie is a condensed version of what's wrong with the new series. But since it's being well reviewed (clearly by people who don't really care about huge plot holes and complete inaccuracies with the past storylines or character development), Dragon Ball will limp on. A true fan doesn't just accept what's given to them, because it's new. A true fan recognizes that there are issues and wants to see them fixed. And this really needs some fixing.",1446336000,2,4070,4.43716577540107

7384721,4,B014604U5K,"Resurrection F takes place after the Boo Saga but before the final episode of Dragon Ball Z. It is a sequel to the film Battle of Gods.

Freeza's minions resurrect him using Earth's Dragon Balls, and he trains for the first time ever, allowing him to be a match for any of the Z Fighters despite their massively increased power levels. It's an interesting plot idea that allows fans to revisit the series' best villain.

The fighting in this movie is the best in the series. It is well choreographed and gorgeously animated. One of the highlights of the film is seeing the sidelines Z Fighters get some screen time as they hold off Freeza's forces before the arrival of Goku and Vegeta. We get to see Gohan, Piccolo, Tien, Krillin, Master Roshi, and Jaco (from the Dragon Ball prequel, Jaco the Galactic Patrolman) fight hordes of enemies. This was really a treat--Roshi hasn't been a useful fighter since the King Piccolo Saga. But while keeping the Z Fighters down to 6 is practical and more interesting, it's rather odd to see Roshi and Jaco fight but have Yamcha, Trunks, Goten, Boo, Android 18, Yajirobe, and Chiaotzu conspicuously absent. Aren't all of them stronger than or equal to Jaco and Roshi? Some of these characters are given weak excuses for their absences, and some are completely ignored.

Despite its beauty, the fighting is not really a struggle for anyone. Even the fight with Freeza is not especially difficult. Vegeta, despite having a million and one reasons to hate Freeza with a burning passion, *mostly* just watches the fight calmly. If there was ever a time to put Vegeta in the limelight, it was now. Missed opportunity.

The new forms in this film are not to my tastes aesthetically. The new Super Saiyan God form is essentially a Super Saiyan with blue hair--an improvement over the skinny god with pink hair from the last film. Freeza's new form is a tacky gold-and-purple. Bruce Faulconer is also sorely missed.

Overall, one of the best DBZ films. Great action, good comedy.",1446249600,8,2009,4.761494252873563

This is completely different. I could probably forgive the awful animation transitions,lore mix up, voice actor choices, and a few other little things. But story structure is pretty much the most important thing in a movie and this fails at it about half way through and on. Not everything was done wrong and if you're a die hard fan of course you should watch it; I'm sure i'll watch it quite a bit as well, dbz will always have that nostalgia factor for a lot of people.

I can't believe after all this time, the show has still managed to stay relevant and continue to release feature length films with current animation. No matter what form you watch (DVD/blu Ray), it'll never change the fact that the show is from the 90's.

The new a Resurrection F film is great and hearing some of my favorite voice actors return to bring life to these iconic characters is pure pleasure. The movie is well paced and the action is pretty steady. The previous DBZ film took awhile to build up to the momentum because there was so much standard dialogue between characters before the action ensued.

Definitely pick this up and enjoy 90 mins of pure anime fun even though I think the animation is a bit unrefined at times for a feature film. They clearly didn't get all the best artist in town. Anyways, the 1 star rating is for the digital HD copy which is only compatible with a Vudu account. I couldn't add this film to my existing UV account and I find that beyond frustrating.

This movie was great overall. It has very good action sequences and has a lot of comedy to keep you entertained when there is no fighting, some even happen during fights. Recently I became a Vegeta fan after the way he protected his wife and seemingly went toe to toe with Lord Beerus, for a very short amount of time, in battle of the Gods out of anger and to protect his wife (meaning he reached God strength without even turning SSG). That alone gave him my favorite character slot that Gohan left empty since the company made him a little bitch after the cell saga which still annoys me to this day. WHile the movie was good and flowed properly they ruined it at the end when they just could NOT let Vegeta have his day. This irritated me and the buddies I saw it with. It would have been a sweet victory to let Vegeta have his ultimate payback in taking down Gold Freeza, but NO. They just had to let Goku steal the show yet again. The fans want a new hero on par with Goku saving the day. It gets old that it always has to be Goku and NOTHING can't be done if he doesn't ""save the day."" In fact writing this review makes me angry again and i I could I would push the rating down to a 3.5 but can't, and this movie does not deserve a three by any means so I keep it at a four. Overall great movie but in the final execution it was poor. This is one of the biggest reasons I left DBZ and started loving a lot of other animes where supporting characters were worth a damn and had a major impact on the overall story, meaning they need help to get where they are, which is why I love Naruto.

7384761,4,B014604U5K,"Just like the previous Dragon Ball Z movie, Battle of Gods, Resurrection F revisits themes from the original Dragon Ball Z television series in a nostalgic way that will appeal to fans of the television series, but may not entirely make sense to newcomers to the franchise.

In Resurrection F, the writers make a focused attempt to parody the absurdity of a universe with Senzu Beans that can heal anyone on the brink of death back to full fighting shape and dragon balls that can resurrect folks that didn't eat a Senzu Bean in time.  With these rather reliable methods of recovery stashed in the Z Fighters' bag of tricks, it's hard to create suspenseful action sequences since the universe has been robbed of the permanence of death.

Resurrection F contains a series of self-parodying jokes on the matter.  Senzu Beans are used more judiciously than ever before.  One characters' apparent death is swiftly remedied by force feeding a Senzu Bean.  Bulma literally asks why the Z Fighters should give a crap about anything that happens since they can use the dragon balls to fix anything that goes wrong.

The film also doubles down on the comic absurdity of the original television series.  Two ultra-powerful characters from Battle of Gods make a return, visiting Earth in the midst of Frieza's attack to eat a sundae.  They make it abundantly clear that they could easily stop Frieza, but they just don't feel like it.  Multiple references are made in the film about the fact that Goku and Vegeta would be exponentially more effective at thwarting Earth's threats if they worked together, instead of insisting on fighting adversaries one-on-one (another classic Dragon Ball contrivance--the original television series went so far to maintain the 1v1 battles the status quo that it invented means by which characters, Goku/Vegeta or Trunks/Goten, could merge into a single fighter, instead of battling as a team).

The ending of the movie even creates a brand new deus ex machina solution to the world's problems.  Though, in actuality, the new cure-all solution used in the end is something that has been used in the Dragon Ball universe before.  It begs the question why the Z Fighters don't rely on the same solution more often.  The call back to another classic Dragon Ball deus ex machina seems intentional, as one of the characters makes mention of it during the movie.

Ultimately, the movie is amusing for Dragon Ball veterans, as the overriding themes of self-deprecating nostalgia only work if you're familiar with the history of Dragon Ball.  Newcomers will find the plot to be somewhat absurd and the action sequences can be deceiving since action in movies typically require suspense to work, and there is no such thing as suspense in a world with Senzu Beans and Dragon Ball resurrections.  This movie is all about pointing out the comedy created in such situations.",1445904000,,2884,4.937888198757764

7384772,3,B014604U5K,"It was ok but it's not worth 40 Dollars and I've been a long time DBZ fan. These last few movies and the current Manga have really made me feel DBZ has gone on a Superman envy road. And I don't like it.  To that end things  are shuffling and getting moved around in a way that not only breaks the old DBZ formula but for all the goodness it brings in the fight scenes 90% of it is rushed.
It's worth a rental but that's about it.
First it's hard to say where this falls exactly as a alternate universe. From what I've seen BoG and RoF are in a different Universe than Super but parallels heavily. Power levels are mentioned and if you remember previous mentions of them you know why they don't need to be mentioned anymore. Second it makes you feel like the Z Warriors are the most powerful weaklings on Earth. Why? because it's implied for Gohan and for a few others they haven't been keeping up on their training. End result? A poor showing by pretty much everyone. Some of the Z fighters don't even show (one I'm assuming because he didn't know) But MASTER ROSHI showed up and showed out and sorry if Master Roshi and another old character whose pretty weak are owning these guys.... yeah..
But the Story was so far beyond forgettable and things get heavily skipped. Frieza's training? Skipped Goku becoming Super Saiyan Blue for the first time? Skipped. That epic fight between Vegeta and Frieza that gets hinted at? think left overs. And Frieza pulls the same move basically he pulled when he was losing before. Since it's his go to move no one will be surprised that knows the character.

But him training and getting strong while believable doesn't hold water. He's told SPOILER  .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................
by his father he said to ALWAYS Avoid Majin Buu and Beerus at all cost.  6 months later ? He' stronger than Super Saiyan Blue Goku.  The problem with this? There has been so little shown and made cannon about Frieza's race in the anime and manga. How do they compare to saiyans? What does it mean when they exert themselves? Yeah... I find lots of theories all over the place but nothing that has been put to cannon really. Unless we're counting the alternate reality games , in which case there's still ALOT missing and nothing to explain this.
While not the best the fighting was a fun highlight even though no one seemed to be anywhere near as strong as they were at the end of heck I'd say the Frieza saga for Piccolo and Buu saga for Gohan.
The highlights of the Film Freiza's revival, and his Transformation into Golden Frieza. Also a look at how ki invulnerability works. But I'd seriously hold off or wait til this has a price drop, Frieza is my favorite DBZ villain, and this movie I was so ready for was a let down. I've analyzed it over the last week and I'm liking the trailer better because of what it should have been not what it is.  Rent it, but other wise save your money.

7384777,2,B014604U5K,"Personal rating: 4/10. It just wasn't very good.
Breakdown: Now, before I get heckled on why I didn't think it was ""awesome"" or ""incredible,"" please realize, I watched this on a regular TV and wasn't enamored with the big screen or feeding off of the fellow fanboy energy surrounding the theater on opening weekend. I missed it. I had to work. So, I sat back and TRIED to enjoy the movie, but I just couldn't get over some of the stuff I was watching. This contains spoilers, so If you didn't see the movie yet, I suggest you quit reading. But, I'm telling ya... You're not missing out on much. I'll explain.

Let's look at the storyline. Pretty decent one, and I think they could've made a great movie from this, but they fell short. Basically, Frieza gets resurrected using the dragon balls and the Z warriors have to stop him. Cool right? I thought so... Until it started getting dumb.

First big problem I had: Power levels. These were so inaccurate throughout the whole movie, it made me laugh. You're telling me, that Piccolo, a SUPER NAMEK had trouble fighting off a few hundred of Frieza's henchmen!? No. He could've destroyed the whole army by himself. I seriously doubt he'd have as much trouble taking those guys on, if he took on and defeated Imperfect Cell, who was a lot stronger than Android 17 and 18, who were a lot stronger than super saiyan Trunks, who basically sliced Frieza to pieces. That makes no sense. Even when power levels went as high as Goku, Vegeta and Frieza's did, were you really that impressed? No. Why? The power ups were terrible and rushed. It was literally like, 5 seconds and boom... Transformation. Okay your turn, and the other person would transform quickly. No lead in. No interesting music. No big story on how they got to that level or anything. Which brings me to my next problem.

Second big problem: Laziness. Yes... The writers were lazy in this one. So you're telling me Frieza went from getting sliced up by a super saiyan one, to being A LOT stronger than a super Saiyan 3 or even Super Saiyan god? Okay how? He basically trained for a few weeks and miraculously, was at a new level that was even higher than Kid Buu for instance. Their answer? Basically, Frieza never had to train to be a powerful being. He just was from birth. So when he actually put a little effort into it, he became 50 to 100X stronger? Ridiculous. Come up with something better than that please. I will say, the finished transformations looked cool, but with those power levels, they would've caused a lot of damage to the earth just powering up to full potential. But that didn't happen. Again, literally took 5 to 10 seconds and it was done. No cool lead in. I never felt that Goku was actually in danger of losing the fight except when he got blasted by a ray.

Third big problem: Special fx. This actually made it worse. Give me old fashioned, skilled animation, instead of using computers. A few special effects looked really neat, but for the most part it was unecessary and didn't improve the fight scenes. Examples of good DBZ fight scenes are Goten vs Trunks in the tournament or Goku vs Majin Vegeta. Great fights. No special fx needed.

Last big problem: Too much comedy at inappropriate times.  A few lines made me laugh a little, but it took away from some of the intensity in fights.

All n all, it was just wasn't the same DBZ I grew up watching. It was rushed and came out for one main purpose and that was to make money. I really wanted to enjoy this movie, but I just couldn't. Save your money on this one.",1445731200,,3551,4.487616099071207

7384782,3,B014604U5K,"A decent movie, but not as good as battle of the gods.

On top of that, all the inaccuracies bothered me. I realize most movies don't fit in with the series timelines, but this one takes inaccuracies to new level

1. Shenlong revives freeza in pieces? since when could the dragon only bring someone back incomplete? He's brought back people in FAR worse shape than freeza many times and complete
2. Shenlong revives people where they died, not in front of you. Unless of course you ask him to move them first. In this movie he is brought back in pieces right there on spot.
3. Freeza acted surprised Majin Boo was defeated, like it was first time he knew about it. He WATCHED the fight from hell.
4. Freeza acted surprised vegeta also could turn super. See number 3.
5. Speaking of hell, this movie places freeza in an ""earth hell"". However in the series he was in regular hell with everyone else.

Of course don't get me started about series inaccuracies with the whole ""people of evil heart have their soul cleansed and memories wiped"" thing they constantly talk about. Or that everyone but the most valiant of heroes have their bodies stripped from them. And yet, every villian with the exception of dabora who was sent to heaven, kept their bodies, memories and souls in tact and are allowed to just hang out in hell like it's no big deal. At least in this movie freeza was in a hell that tortured him. I give it plus 1 from that but the inconsistencies still bother me.

While battle of the gods does fit in series and can be an explained time gap (obviously pretending GT never happened, cause it didn't). This one fits less and is hard to explain into the timeline since it doesn't make sense in it's own right. These movies aren't 3rd party and are fully akira supported so it's kind of boggling he's basically intentionally changing/making so many errors.

On the plus, I really do like the new chars though. Especially Beers. I wish there could be a new series with these chars and not few and far in between movies.",1445731200,,2026,4.494565217391305

7384845,5,B014604U5K,"This plays with much of the plot from Dragonball Super (which needs to come to the US already!).  Frieza is resurrected with the help of the newly upgraded dragon balls of earth (now Shenlong grants two wishes, the second one used is sort of a throwaway, so no reason to introduce it here).  He trains.  The Z-fighters train.  They come together in an exceedingly predictable fight and kick the snot out of each other.

And it is so much fun.  Beerus is a trip the entire time.  Vegeta is at the top of his form, so much better than the last movie, Goku is that crazy combination of serious and funny that makes him so delightful and Krillian kicks it old school.

7384851,5,B014604U5K,"This is, by far, the best dragonball z film to date. Is it better than Cell games, or some of the heated battles or really messed up serious moments? No, but it is pretty excellent.

""Ressurection F"" may come off like any other DBZ movie: oh look, a villain is coming, we gotta stop him, fight, roll credits. Well, they went above and beyond to insure there would be more to this. Warning-tons of spoilers ahead.

This movie starts off with the premise that Freiza being resurrected has been a goal for a while, but tracking down a safe place to get dragon balls has been difficult. So they take the risk, and they succeed. It is revealed, Freiza never trained for a single day a bit later on, and this comes as no surprise. Before that, we are shown a army and in addition, some humor with Emperor Pilaf making things all too easy. A rather disturbing scene of a ""not completly together"" Freiza follows, and I will say, to anime fans who watch shows like ""Deadman Wonderland, ""Claymore,"" etc, it may not seem so disturbing. But maybe it will. No worries, technology has advanced, and Freize is reassembled, no mechanics this time either.

Revealing what Freiza's ""Hell"" was like was both hilarious and messed up. Not that he deserves better, but it's still like ""yep.""
When Freiza decides to go back to earth with an army of 1,000, some great action and character fights follow.
This is where a lot of complaints have come from, as many say it is ridiculous who is there and who is not, and also that Gohan is again basically sidelined. It's not untrue. For one, Krillin brings Master Roshi, but Tien doesn't bring Chaotsu or Yamcha? They were light-years beyond Master Roshi's strength. So that made no sense. That being said, they do a good job of making it obvious Master Roshi isn't keeping up, Krillin coming to his aid at some point, and on top of that, Gohan saves Krillin, and eventually Piccolo from Freiza's current most powerful fighter. Freize specifically points out that Gohan is not going full max (even with still being ""out of the game""-no training), as he doesn't wish to kill, or the entire army would've been gone in seconds. Gohan would do that, he is not evil, he's not even Vegeta obviously.

After this Goku and Vegeta (along with Beerus who humorously freaks out Freiza later and Wees) show up, and the ""real battle"" begins. For a rematch of what I believe is still the longest anime fight of all the time (30+ episodes was it), it was extremely well done. The Super Saiyan god form goes blue, Freiza mocks it as hair-dye, and Freiza goes golden. His colors alter as does multiple areas of his body: this is not just ""Freiza is golden"" as many like to say. Also, as far as a super saiyan form, i am not sure where fans wanted them to go after super long haired 3. Did they want them to have hair creepingly long and able to attack/choke people like say, Sailor Moon's ""Mistress 9?""

A cheap shot was also a big area of fans outcry. I think everyone who was so angered about the shot at Goku taking him down should go back and watch the series again. Krillin throws a rock and hurts Goku, and he also hurts his foot on a rock later, these are just 2 examples. They are not impenetrable, simply on their guard and thus maxed out. They can still be hurt easily, they are just smarter than that. It was unexpected and quite amazing. Vegeta swarms in to save the day, only for yet another extremely creepy scene to follow.

And that is something that goes over this whole film. While it has it's light moments 4sure (Beerus eating Pizza, Wees and him eating other foods), it has some very dark tone to it. They aren't given five minutes, they are not easily all saved. HUGE SPOILER! Freiza takes out the whole earth b4 Vegeta even gets to finish off his big moment. Poor Vegeta...Vegeta fans, deal, seriously why would u want the movie to be predictable?
It might help, that the special effects are so suberb, even though we know certain things (like, for instance, the hereos are gonna win the end), watching earth slowly crumble and being oblitered, Vegeta dying (again), and everyone aside from Goku, the gods, and those who fought the army (plus Bulma and Jaco-a cool addition who has his own manga-do check it out it's fun!), are alive and realize they lost. Fear not, time is reversed, and Goku takes out Freiza b4 this terrible event happens. It lasted just long enough to have a terrifying impact though.

I think it was a good idea not to include too many characters as well, against other's opinions. We do not see anyone whose not going to fight essentially. I would've liked to see Andriod 18, Yamcha, and Chaotsu, but we really didn't need Videl, Buu, Mr. Satan, or others there, and it allowed for more of the stars and less of those who are cool, but don't need to be in every scene/film/episode/movie.

Yes, this a ""revenge-plot"" movie and there isn't much more to the plot than that. But let's face it, Freiza was the one who set off every disastrous event since day 1, even Cell on some level (since his DNA was used in that concoction-can we get Resurrection-C next?). This ""rematch"" of sorts does not disappoint. Forgot to mention, Freiza's arrival involves blowing up an entire city in one hit. Fun right? Let this movie be fun, well done, with great special effects, excellent battles, many terrifying moments, and well done fight scenes. It was far more thrilling than battle of gods, despite Beerus being awesome, and far more engaging than most of the DBZ movies, even Wrath of The Dragon and yes, Broly: Legendary Super Saiyan. It definitely beats out many sagas of the series I'd say too: again, no comparison to Cell, or the namek-to-freiza saga.

One more shed light on the humor: Goku and Vegeta both make jokes of their ""fusion"" multiple times, Bulma yells at Freiza calling endless names, and humorously sees him for the first time. This series knows when to take things seriously and when not too-most of the time-this is one time where it did better than usual (an example of failing to me is the entire Fusion Reborn movie, or Beerus vs. Vegeta in battle of gods, where it was a sushi joke the whole time).

I'd reccomend this to even casual fans of the series, for as long as they know Freiza was a galactic nightmare of a being who, by all means, has done way more damage than perhaps anyone we've seen to date (all-right, Beerus-god of destruction, and Majin Buu was nasty as well, but time ((Beerus is mega old)), plus how far did Buu even get b4 being stopped?), there is nothing to not understand or not enjoy.
5 out of 5, as opposed to battle of gods, which I'd do 4 out of 5, Broly and Wrath OT Dragon would get 4.5 out of 5.",1445558400,,6689,4.502471169686985

7384882,2,B014604U5K,"I'm gonna be honest. I thought this movie sucked, even by DBZ movie standards. (IE: Low standards) I mean it's always pretty cool seeing anime in theaters, but this was really disappointing. This movie felt void of stakes. It didn't take itself seriously, and most importantly it did everything DBZ does right wrong.

Here's some things it did wrong:

1) How come Piccolo, and Gohan suck so much? I'm sorry but even freaking Krillen should be able to defeat Freiza at this point in the series. Also I get that Gohan stopped training and is generally a terrible character (Adult Gohan) But why does Piccolo suck. Isn't he a super-Nakekian? And it's not just that they lose to Frieza, but the fact that they have ANY trouble with his men. In a show about progression, it just doesn't make sense.

2) The CGI was bad. And I mean bad! Battle of Gods had this problem too, but at least that movie was above average. It looks early 2000s DBZ game bad.

3) This movie was anti-climatic as hell! Broly: Second Coming was a mediocre film, but climax was at least good enough to save the film. This one just sucks.

4) The fight scenes were bland and forgettable. Battle of Gods may not have had that much fighting, but the fighting that was in there was at least cool and memorable. This was just poor.

5) Freiza should have trained a whole year instead of months.

6) Goku and Vegeta should have transformed for the first time in their battle with Frieza.

7) Despite manga-author Akira Toriyama being fully involved in the production, this film is one of the most unorganized and anti-climatic.

As far as good things the movie did, well. For starters, Jaco was a good new character. Goku and Vegeta training with Beerus and Whis was pretty sweet. Micah Solusod's character/voices was pretty great. And that shot of Freiza in the revival pod at the beginning of the film was great.

It wasn't the worst DBZ movie. But it definitely had the most wasted potential.

Least in my opinion.

Hope Dragonball: Super is pretty good at least.",1445385600,2,2027,4.6

7384904,3,B014604U5K,"Let me preface this review by saying that the score here is not based upon the merits of the movie itself but more based upon what you are actually getting for your money out of this ""Special"" edition. I personally don't feel as though Resurrection F is anywhere close to the fun mixture of DB humor with Dragon Ball Z action that Battle Of Gods was, the story also seemed a bit less cohesive in places (particularly the giant Deus Ex Machina ending) nevertheless it's a fun and gloriously over the top raucous action packed movie that deserves to be on the shelf of ANY self respecting DBZ fan.
With that out of the way lets get down to brass tax, what is it you are spending your money on??? What are the differences between this version at $34.99 (or higher on the Funi website where it's listed at $44.99) and the standard $20.00 edition??? Well the packaging and the price tag. That's pretty much it. The special features are identical, both include a digital copy, blu ray copy and regular DVD copy the only major difference is in how they look and the holographic Frieza recruitment cards. Don't get me wrong the packaging looks great but an additional $15 to $25 tacked on to the price tag for some cosmetic differences??? No booklets filled with storyboards or original art??? no extra special feature, maybe an interview with Toriyama??? Maybe a few pages of the manga?? no exclusive code for the soon to be released Extreme Butoden??? I think people should receive a bit more if they're going to spend an extra $15 to $25 on a product. I don't mind cosmetics and display editions such as the special edition of Cowboy Bebop that came with its own display easel or even the DBZ Rock The Dragon Edition is one thing, you got a hard cover book that is impressive in size that you could easily display for fan cred though at the time of its release the price tag was too high... BUT this paltry showing??? Come on Funi, you could have stepped up your game a little.

Long story short, Unless you are just straight up a DBZ fanboy and NEED to own what they claim is the ""Ultimate"" edition then I say stick with the standard edition. This just doesn't have enough content and isn't worth the $15 to $25 more you will have to put down for it.

Edit: So after double checking the pack it came in it's actually not an Amazon Fulfillment center it's just a different distributing center they shipped mine from instead of directly from their Fort Worth,TX area center. So that was my mistake. Still wouldn't recommend ever getting anything from Funi directly unless you get a really good deal which isn't likely as pretty much every online outlet has their items at a much better price.",1445212800,36,2686,4.5246913580246915

7384947,4,B014604U5K,"This movie is good. Really good. But there were a few nitpicks i had with it.

First of all it should be said that if you are a fan of the series you should see this movie, and if you are a true collector you should buy the collector's edition no questions asked. The fighting is great and the CGI in this movie (mostly used for Frieza Soldiers) is improved upon from Battle of Gods. It's also amazing that we got to see Roshi kick some butt along side the rest of the B-Team and newcomer, Jaco.

However, this movie does have some flaws. It feels empty. Maybe that's just me, but if you recall in Battle of Gods there was a lot of plot-driven points in the film leading up to the original Super Saiyan God form and the introduction of a new antagonist, as well as a new possibility for the fighters. Resurrection 'F' lacks that. There was some expedition in the form of the revival itself, and the 2 SSJG's new training regimen, but everything was too straightforward. Minimal plot other than Frieza returning with his army, and the Saiyans showing off another new power.

That being said it's not the worst thing that could've been done. Some love the cut-to-the-chase action in this movie, and rightfully so. Though if you're like me and have been with the series all the from Dragon Ball to GT that might not be enough to whet your whistle.",1444521600,2,1344,4.411290322580645

7384965,3,B014604U5K,"In my opinion, this is up there with some of the best DBZ movies yet it still was quite lacking. The movie had some great animations and fight choreography, the humor in it actually made me laugh for real. And that is where all the good stuff ends. My first major problem with this movie was Frieza, why did they bring him back? The Goku and Frieza fight in DBZ is considered one of the longest battles ever in an anime series, and after that Frieza came back as Mecha Frieza and gets killed by Future Trunks. Instead of using some original content and creativity to make a brand new villain they decided to bring back one of the most annoying and literal punching bag villains in DBZ.

The plot was not that great as well. Some important characters were not present in the showdown with Frieza's army. I don't see how Master Roshi was handling himself so well against Frieza's men when he hasn't been a strong relevant fighter since Dragon Ball. This would have been a good opportunity to bring Yamcha back into fighting. People say that Yamcha is useless and gets killed too easily, well this would have been a great time to bring him into the spotlight and show how much stronger he has gotten. Supposed Frieza trained for 4 months to get to the amount of power he has and yet we don't know what kind of training he did in order to do so, I think that should have been integral to the plot. Also Golden Frieza is a waste of time and money, why couldn't they give him a transformation with more physical changes? I know Toriyama likes to do simplistic but this is ridiculous.

I like that Goku has SOMEWHAT grown more into a responsible person at the end of the movie, knowing that being too relaxed and too over confident would leave him vulnerable. Overall, I think this storyline would have been best if put in Dragon Ball Super so it can be properly fleshed out. But I swear I will give up on Dragon Ball Super if they decide to do the whole Golden Frieza thing over again. Overall it is a good movie with some various issues here and there, a hardcore Dragon ball fan will love it but otherwise it is only passable.",1443052800,4,2122,4.369620253164557

7384979,3,B014604U5K,"THIS IS A SPOLIER REVIEW! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

Now I am going to give my review of this movie when I saw it in theaters. I will be pointing out the things I liked about this movie and things I didn't. We will also be discussing plot. Let's begin.

First off the main reason I have gone to see this film was because of the return of the greatest Dragon Ball villain of all time! FREEZA! FREEZA! FREEZA! FREEZAAAAA!!! To all of you that say that Freeza returning is overused and doesn't make sense you need to get those other DBZ films out of your head. Those DO NOT COUNT AS THEY ARE NOT CANON. Therefore this is the FIRST TIME Freeza has returned from the dead and no he did not die on Namek when it blew up he survived.

First let's talk about Freeza. If you think bringing Freeza back was juts fan service you are wrong. Upon his return he takes it upon himself to actually train for once. This makes a lot of sense as Freeza was lazy back then believing there was no one that can stand up to him he didn't think he would have to train but that bites him in the rear as we all know what happened on Namek. Freeza trains for a mere four months and within that time he surpasses all the previous villains and even the likes of Majin Buu. Some believe this is stupid because they refuse to believe that someone like Freeza can catch up to Goku and Vegeta in which is say get over it. This is actually amazing! Freeza's very power, his Ki, is so potent and his determination to get revenge on Goku was so strong he was able to catch up to a God Goku. In fact he was STRONGER than God Goku and was winning until he makes the mistake of not training in his new Golden Freeza form as it drains more power than his body can supply. This is legit and makes sense and fits his character. Now as for his new form I absolutely love it! He is taller and bulker and he is gold to make his revenge that much sweeter. He was defeated by the Gold Warrior (Super Saiyan) and now he plans to defeat Goku as the Golden Warrior. Freeza DOES WIN again Goku seeing as Goku was a fool to let his guard down. It doesnt matter if Freeza used a dirty move because like he said he was not going to allow the slightest chance of losing to Goku again. Freeza won the fight and Goku lost which is refreshing. Freeza's voice actor nails it and there is no flaw to Freeza in this movie.

Now let's talk about Goku. He is an idiot and I have lost respect for him as a hero. Let me explain. In the movie when the fight between God Goku and Golden Freeza is approaching Goku GIVE FREEZA THE CHANCE TO LEAVE AND COME BACK ANOTHER DAY?! WHY?! You call that a hero? That's what I call a STUPID SAIYAN. The planet even blows up and IT'S GOKU'S FAULT! Even Beerus says it to his face. Why would Goku give Freeza the chance to live and come back? This is the guy that upright killed billions of people, killed Goku's best friend at one point, and now here Freeza is and Goku gives Freeza the chance to leave and come back another day? That is just wrong. Here let me abridge the scenario...

""Hey you okay down there Freezer?""
""Oh don't worry I'm just fine. Nothing but daises down here...""
""Hey I got an idea!""
""What?""
""Why don't you leave, train, and come back again someday and we will fight again?""
"".................You can't be serious?""
""Yeah huh.""
""So let me get this straight. You want to escape...""
""Yeah.""
""Continue training?""
""Yup.""
""And come back and destroy you for good knowing that it took me only four months to surpass you while solving my drainage issue.""
""That's right!""
""................You do realize if I am able to become this strong in just four months that I will far exceed you more with additional time of training. If I could do this in four months you don't worry what I can do with another?""
""...............Wow now that you put it that way.""
""Kay thanks. Bye!""
""NO WAIT!!!""
*Freeza leaves*
""Uh oh...I don't think I am going to get mouth present after all of this.""

Now let's talk about Vegeta. Vegeta is once again treated as useless. The film makes him important as much as Goku but once again he is given the shaft. Vegeta can become a God as well which is pretty cool and Goku and Vegeta are equal now which is a good thing. Anyway when Goku loses the fight to Freeza it is Vegeta that decides to take over. Akira couldn't even give Vegeta the kill but instead he decides to take the safe route and leave Goku as the hero...AGAIN.

Now let's talk about the sense of doom. There is NONE here! In fact at the beginning of the film you can already guess what is going to happen at the end because Whis essentially spoils it and out of nowhere HE KNOWS HOW TO REVERT TIME! The fact that he knows how to reverse time is merely to set up Goku to be the hero in the end while giving Vegeta short spotlight and be fan service to fans of Vegeta. Knowing this there is no sense of doom like there was in Battle of Gods.

The fight are excellent! I love it. It is well done the animation looks great. Although there were moments where the characters looked like they were video game characters from PS2. I'm looking at you both God Goku and Golden Freeza. With all of this the film is nothing different from Namek saga. It is just a retelling of it but on Earth. Hence why the title of this review with Akira being afraid of being different. It's basically the same scenario of that saga just not as long.

Now let's talk about how this movie could've been BETTER! Even though I had problems with the things I pointed out above I will say fine keep that but there was one thing that SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE ENDING. VEGETA SHOULD'VE BEEN THE HERO!!! I know what some are going to say to accuse me as a Vegeta fanboy and let me tell you this I am not. To those that say that DBZ is all about Goku which means he has to be hero. He did it with Gohan against Cell so why not Vegeta? Vegeta killing Freeza and ending up being the hero would have made the film that much greater. You would have the community talking about it. When I saw him kicking Freeza's face in I was getting so excited believing that finally he was going to get the shine and respect he DESERVES. Vegeta's entire life was ruined by Freeza meaning he should've been the one to kill Freeza. NOT GOKU!

Seriously there are more than eight times that Goku has been the hero. Should have gave something different Akira but you just disappointed in that area because you want to play it safe with Goku so as to not upset fans. Battle of Gods is BETTER than Resurrection F but that doesn't mean it's not enjoyable to watch. This is why it gets three stars instead of five. Not say that you shouldn't buy it but just know that it has many flaws. The only thing that is worth it in this movie to me was Freeza and that is all.

Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan. Wow that's a mouthful and a stupid name. Thank goodness Goku just said that he got a taste of Super Saiyan God which is what is should be called. He might as well had called it another shorter dumb name like Super Saiyan blue. Haha! (Reads Dragon Ball Super Manga Chapter 5) OH COME ON!!!",1442102400,,7089,4.212812960235641

The personalities of the characters are just plain ridiculous...Number 18 stays behind so krilling can go fight?

Long time DBZ fan.  This movie was the biggest let down yet.  It had potential, and just completely failed to deliver.  You get Goku and Vegeta training with Whis, and apparently harnessing their SSG powers.  Freeza gets resurrected and brings a force of crappy warriors to earth to invade.  Lots of care goes into making sure none of the Z fighters just wipe them out in a single flash like they could have done, well most of them anyway.

Some crappy dialog ensues where Gohan basically says I'm a bitch and not even going to try.  SO of course Goku and Vegeta show.  Goku obviously has to fight first.  Vegeta gets impatient and jumps in because he wants the easy kill.  Goku stops him and agrees they will switch.  Freeza turns gold when he realizes he has no chance.  More undermining of Vegeta's character making him look like a punk happens by him not wanting to trade out with Goku when he senses Freeza's new power.  Goku and Freeza keep fighting.  It becomes apparent Freeza can't maintain his power level due to lack of training.  Vegeta then offers to step in when he realizes it will be an easy win.  (I really hate what has been done with Vegeta over the course of the movies and series.  They waste no effort to make a once insanely awesome warrior look like a bitch).

After smacking Freeza a few times, Freeza destroys the planet when he realizes he can't win.  Whis turns back time and goku kills Freeza to save the day.

The fight was painfully short.  Not even one of the better DBZ fights.  It was rather dull and boring.  There was a few funny jokes here and there, but for the most part the story was just drawn out.  I think more could have gone into Freeza's character development, as well as him perhaps bringing a fighting force that could have squared off with the other fighters for at least a more entertaining plot.

The worst part of all of it was this movie was the perfect opportunity for a Vegeta redemption.  They really could have given the fight to Vegeta.  They could have had Goku step up and for once not be able to win.  This could have been where Vegeta stepped forward and after a grueling battle come out on top.  Thus saving face for the story, making Freeza actually at least appear to be a real threat this time, and giving fans what they've wanted for a long time.",1441324800,10,2340,4.412177985948477

7384990,4,B014604U5K,"It's a fun movie if you enjoy Dragon Ball/Z.  The only thing I wish it had more of was time. It was about 90 minutes, but I think it could have used another *5 minutes* through out the movie to develop and show things a bit more in depth.. and to stretch out the ending a bit because once the final fight ends- the main characters exchange some dialogue and within about 60 seconds... roll credits.  I was hoping to see at least one more scene after the exchange of dialogue.  I mean hour and 30 something minutes is great compared to the older DBZ movie that are 45 to 55 minute movies, but if this was an hour and 40.... or even an hour and 45 minutes, I wouldn't mind one bit.",1440892800,,679,4.090225563909774
7384991,5,B014604U5K,I rarely write reviews but I have to on this. I had completely stop watching Dragonball Z since it went off the air. Then I saw battle of the Gods and  overall i wasn't impressed. I didn't like the look of Super Saiyan God and i was confused a little from the GT saga. It took me a while but then I finally got to watch Resurrection F and it made me remember why I used to love the show so much. I couldn't help but feel nostalgia throughout the entire movie because I used to watch this show everyday as a kid with my dad. Me and my friends literally used to run home from school to catch the show because in the 90's kids didn't have Youtube or anything so if you missed an episode you just missed it. I loved everything about this movie and it was good to hear all the original voices return. Friezas was slightly different but quickly grows on you. All I have left to say if you've ever been a dragonball fan you simply have to watch this. Ignore the bad reviews and see it for yourself. This is my new favorite movie.,1440806400,,1022,4.08457711442786
7384992,3,B014604U5K,"Dude I thought they would get it right this time but no, the movie felt so quickly over. Friezier returns and he basically has the upper hand for 5 mins then yep goku shows his ""true powers""  gladly this time vegeta is also stronger than friezer. But the plot was just a big no. The first 30 mins is small chatter on earth, the next 30 mins is friezer ploting his plans instead of showing no mercy and going in for the kill instantly like you know him from the saga series......Gohan is no match, I guess trunks isn't here yet(timeline I dunno) it was said that goku destroyed majin buu yet trunks isn't around or buu himself. Battle of the gods was more entertaining. This was a big let down for a Frezier return......... If they decide to bring Cell back they have to make him more of a threat",1440806400,2,795,4.264900662251655
7384993,2,B014604U5K,"So many power discrepancies. Roshi was too strong and Piccolo was too weak. Never felt like Frieza had a chance.

Especially the song when Frieza is being revived! For any dissatisfaction I had, it would have to be about not having to really try. I had hoped that Goku and Vageta turned SSGSS because of the fact that Frieza reached a new level and form. As for the collectors edition it looks really awesome, but I had hoped for more stuff, I mean who doesnt. Overall, this movie and collection is a must have.",1440547200,2,555,4.398058252427185

7384997,3,B014604U5K,"As a Dragon Ball fan who's seen the Dragon Ball films 1-4, Dragon Ball Z films 1-13 and all the rest I have to say that Resurrection F came off as rather very disappointing of a Dragon Ball Z movie. The villain is Freeza whom we already knew before and so basically he powers up, tries to defeat the Saiyans and fails then becomes the Golden Freeza which ultimately doesn't make much difference considering he still gets beaten down.

Freeza as it stands now is merely a punching bag rather than a real threat any more so in comparison to other DBZ movie villains and plot-wise (it went straight to beat the bad dudes and that's it) Resurrection F wasn't very good as an entertaining film, yet, I'll happily admit that it's watchable so it's not terribad by any means. Let's not forget about the FUNimation dub for the English markets, it's fairly obvious the FUNimation cast has went in great detail to make a spectacular dub so if you happen to dislike the movie then the dub will be there to make it tolerable.

Something I also really disliked was how they redrawn Bulma and Gohan to the point of being unrecognisable which made no sense considering they had a consistent design for 26 years and then poof, they did it unnecessarily. Thankfully in Dragon Ball Super they had the good sense to go back to the original designs.

Lastly, as the product cover shows Goku turns to a blue Saiyan which in official terms is ""Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan"" and he's not the only one as Vegeta too became a blue haired Saiyan. Still, Vegeta never became a Super Saiyan God (red hair Saiyan) so it came as a surprise that he managed it. Was this impressive? Honestly, no.

Now, I'm not trying to be pessimistic but I just didn't enjoy it the movie still a lot of folks out there did so more power to them. I'll rather just stick to Dead Zone, World's Strongest, Tree of Might, Fusion Reborn and Wrath of the Dragon. Despite my displeasure with this movie I'll still be getting it on Blu-ray for my Dragon Ball collection (DBZ Movies 1-13 on DVD and 14-15 on BD).",1440547200,35,2056,4.460106382978723
