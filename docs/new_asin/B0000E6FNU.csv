8002131,5,B0000E6FNU,its a good series that is action packed and just great. it does have some wtf moments but its still good.,1370390400,,105,4.0476190476190474
8002132,5,B0000E6FNU,"We're both fans of Takashi Miike and ridiculous gory action movies in general. This trilogy is hilariously over-the-top with a lot of nods to other over-the-top action movies/actors/directors. Miike does gore and ridiculousness well and the two main actors are AMAZING men that are entertaining in all their works.

This is like a Die Hard franchise with a spy vs spy twist of ridiculousness. I compare these to Hot Fuzz and Kung Fu Hustle with a lot of gore to make you uncomfortable.",1357689600,,485,4.843373493975903
8002133,3,B0000E6FNU,"I liked the first one alot.  I liked the two stories that were going on in the movie.  Don't be fooled by the title Dead or Alive though.  I think of it more of a drama then an action flick.

I thought the second one had a fantastic story.  I liked the scenes outside. I think all of the outside shots looked beautiful.  Expect very little action though in this one.  Its a story about 2 step brothers that havn't seen eachother since they were childeren.

Now for the third one. I liked the story up to a point, and then the movie just ended.  It was like they ran out of money and just threw a rediculous end together.  The story had a lot of potential and someone ruined it.  I don't know what they were thinking. If this one wasn't so horrible I def would have given the trilogy 4 stars.",1142467200,,791,4.104575163398692
8002134,4,B0000E6FNU,"I was on a real Miike kick when I bought this, and I seriously doubt that anyone could have convinced me to do what I'm about to suggest to you. Don't buy this trilogy, only the first movie is really worthwhile. Two and Final don't compare with the excellence of the first Dead Or Alive (which rates 5 stars). Have you ever seen a sequel, by a director you respect and found that ol' magic just ain't there any more? You sat there, watching helplessly as they tried (and you could tell by watching that they were trying really HARD) unsuccesfully to catch lightning in a bottle one more time. Depressing, yes? Save yourself the pain of watching this happen twice. Better to spend your money on Visitor Q or Fudoh The New Generation. Still, if you've gotta see all three...",1138924800,13,772,4.4822695035460995
8002135,4,B0000E6FNU,"A great collection.. must have for any Miike's fan.. the only complaint is the second DVD of the trilogy, Birds, has some heavily censored scenes.

As for the movies themselves, Riki Takeuchi and Sho Aikawa carry themselves extremely well.. the trilogy presents the conflict between these two characters over a wide range of social, political and futuristic scenarios.. its hard to choose my favorite among the three, all three are awesome have their own rewarding experiences, but I'd narrowly pick the second one, its got a very unique flavor to it.. never expected Miike to be such a sucker for ""childhood nostalgia"".. somewhat reminscent of Kitano's Kikujiro.

Anyway, I would highly recommend viewers unfamiliar with the Yakuza-related genre of Japanese action-cult flicks to first sample this trilogy before venturing into many other works of Miike (Ichi, Gozu, audition).",1113696000,8,878,5.355072463768116
