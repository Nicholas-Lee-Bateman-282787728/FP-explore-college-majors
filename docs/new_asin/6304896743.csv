7880404,3,6304896743,"I am not a Godzilla fan. My children, especially my 9-year-old son, are both big fans. They have watched these videos several times since receiving the set as a Christmas gift. My 11-year-old nephew has also enjoyed watching the movies. I thought the movies were boring and had horrible graphics but, as noted earlier, I am not a fan. The other adults in our family did not enjoy watching the set either. That is why I am giving them a 3.",1106092800,,438,4.419753086419753

""Godzilla vs. Megalon"" is one of the most goofiest Godzilla films in the whole series and ""Godzilla 1985""  is one of the scariest, most down to earth Godzilla films. You will be  really confused if your first Godzilla movies are these 2 in a 2 pack.  First you watch ""Godzilla 1985"" and think ""WOW, Godzilla is  a force to be reconed with. He's a huge, lumbering, radioactive horror, who  kills anithing in sight!"" Then you watch ""Godzilla vs.  Megalon"", and now Godzilla is dancing, flying, and doing flying kicks  on his tail and co- starring with a happy, dancing robot who can change  size when he wants to. What will a person being introduced to this series  think of this? ""NEVER AGAIN WILL I WASTE MY MONEY ON THIS JUNK""  is what they will think! Now mabey if they put ""Godzilla, King of the  Monsters"" and ""Godzilla 1985"" in a 2 pack...",953856000,,933,4.39766081871345
