DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER: THE RIC FLAIR SHOOT INTERVIEW is a HighSpots production, in which ""Nature Boy"" Ric Flair chronicles his career in a shoot interview.  For those unfamiliar, shoot interviews involve a person who's worked in the pro wrestling business.  What makes it a ""shoot"" is that they're largely uninterrupted and unedited.  In other words, the person will talk as long as he/she wants, and you the viewer better pray he/she keeps your attention for the entire interview.

Most shoot interviews I've watched last about 2 hours.  But since ""Nature Boy"" Ric Flair goes from the very beginning of his life to his retirement in Orlando, we are privileged to 3 discs of content, spanning a monstrous 10.5 hours of footage!  And that's just the standard program!

There is a 3-disc version of DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER available.  This 4-disc set includes even more deleted interview footage.  Even though I own the 4-disc set, I'm gonna mainly focus on the main program that's included on the 3-disc set.

As I said before, the main program is over 10 hours long, and to my astonishment, I rarely had to take a break.  Normally the most boring parts of a documentary or biography are the early years, before the wrestler has made into the big leagues of professional wrestling.  However, Flair from the get-go keeps our attention as he details how he was introduced to TV wrestling, and how he eventually entered the business through a fateful meeting with Ken Patera.  Even if you haven't watched the WWE's other DVDs on Ric Flair -- there are THREE of them -- I think you'll still be able to visualize the experiences of Flair's early days of training in Minnesota with Verne Gagne, and eventually making into Mid-Atlantic promotions in the early 70s.

The first disc primarily focuses on Flair's career up until his first run in the World Wrestling Federation in 1991-1993.  For a while, Flair reminisces fondly of just about everyone he worked with, and remembers to give tons of credit to the many wrestlers who impacted his career.  Harley Race, Wahoo McDaniels, Buddy Rogers, Johnny Valentine, Dusty Rhodes, Ricky Steamboat (before their famous 80s TV classics)....the list goes on and on and on, and I don't recall getting bored through any of it.  After all, who doesn't enjoy seeing a wrestler have a good time sharing all of the good memories he had?

Flair speaks very candid about his first NWA title run, and does a superb job of detailing what the National Wrestling Alliance was, and how it functioned.  I'd wager that anybody who doesn't really know what the NWA was will still get a firm grasp on how significant and honorable the organization was.  Although Flair (and most fans & critics) consider Flair's 2nd NWA title victory the more meaningful of his career, ""Nature Boy"" still has a ton of stories about the different territories, and who some of the key players were in each.  If you've ever seen the WWE's MCMAHON DVD, then you're probably aware of the geography of how pro wrestling was divided in the United States.  Again, don't be intimidated if you don't know how the business was run pre-WWF.  Again, Ric Flair and the interviewer do an excellent job of balancing between the hardcore audience and the newcomers.  You better get used to me saying that for the rest of the review.

Surprisingly, there's really nothing about the Four Horsemen that the WWE DVD didn't cover.  Sure, there are some personal stories and different perspectives from their unbelieveable success in the business, but don't be surprised if it doesn't blow your mind.  Bear in mind, the portion on the Four Horsemen isn't boring, just nothing new.  Ric Flair takes the time to recall how he felt on each of the Horsemen throughout the 3-disc program.

The second disc (if I recall correctly) begins in the middle of Ric Flair talking about his first run with the WWF.  What may surprise most viewers is that Flair compliments the company in just about every aspect, begging the question of why Flair ever decided to leave in 1993.  The answer is Flair's loyalty to the NWA/WCW; that admirable quality eventually became a suffering trait of ""Nature Boy"".  As with just about everything else on DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER, we get a very good idea of how some of Vince McMahon's key players were brought to the WCW, mainly Hulk Hogan, Lex Luger, and ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage.

I want to pause for a moment to clarify something about me: I'm a ""WWE fan"", not exactly a ""pro wrestling fan"".  My knowledge of the WCW is pretty lacking; however, I understood just about everything Flair was talking about.  Bear in mind, these shoot interviews often allow the wrestlers to segue into other stories and comments that don't necessarily answer the interviewer's questions.  But have no fear, because Flair's stories almost always give an insider's point-of-view during some of the WCW's key events.  Wanna know what was going on in Ric Flair's head during his runs with Savage, Hogan, and Vader.  WWE's DEFINITIVE COLLECTION DVD didn't do a good job in my opinion; DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER wipes the floor with the WWE's 2008 documentary in almost every way.  You might not get the TV footage, but Flair's collective memory makes up for it.

DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER runs into a few tiny patches where Flair's story seemingly goes nowhere.  That's mainly due to the fact that the WCW, despite Flair's loyalty to the company, slowly and painfully disintegrated after being bought by Turner Broadcasting Company in the late 80s.  You will hear story after story of how incredibly disrespectful the WCW and its executives (according to Flair) were unappreciatve of the company's key performer.  This can become tiring, especially if you agree with what Ric Flair says.  How many wrestling fans would rather watch the Flair/Steamboat matches from the 80s rather than the 90s?  How about the Sting/Flair encounters from the 80s instead of the 90s?  I'd imagine that if you were watching the WCW, and wondering where the magic went, then this 2nd disc might be tough to sit through.

The 3rd disc begins when Flair chronicles the end of the WCW in its last few years.  Despite being even more of a chaotic nuthouse, Flair actually recalls a few funny stories, mainly of some ""Insane Asylum"" angle that I never heard about.  Just listening to Flair's descriptions make me want to search YouTube for these sketches.  Thankfully and rightfully so, Flair becomes much more positive when he discusses how the WWF rehired him in 2001.  Even though the WWE's DEFINITIVE COLLECTION did a decent job explaining how Flair had confidence issues, this is still a story worth revisiting.  To listen to an amazing wrestler grip with his own self-confidence is still a surprising tale.

This might be a good time to inform you that Flair is often asked about the individual wrestlers working with WCW & WWF at the time Flair was around.  ""Nature Boy"" has plenty to say about everybody, but thankfully, he's not very bitter about many wrestlers.  Even some of his least favorite opponents like Sid Vicious, Ultimate Warrior, Bret Hart, and Rob Van Dam aren't crucified.  It is noteworthy that Flair dedicates a good 5 minutes to the Montreal Screwjob on Disc 2.

But back to the main program, I think what most viewers will take away from Disc 3 are these two focus points: Ric Flair's good relationship with Vince McMahon, and how Flair truly feels about the legacy he's left on the business.  If you thought his Hall of Fame speech was heartfelt, you have no idea how humbled Flair gets in the program's closing minutes.  I was stunned, pure and simple.

There are a hundred (yes, ""100"") topics I haven't discussed.  You'll hear about the Benoit family tragedy in June 2007, the plane crash from 1978, the fun he had with Evolution, the fun he had with just about anything else, and who Flair thinks are the WWE's key players in the business.

I only have a few minor gripes with this 10.5-hour program.  I was praying that someone could tell me what beef Vince McMahon and Randy Savage have with each other, but Flair simply doesn't have a clue, just like nobody else seems to.  Another quibble is that because this is a pretty long shoot interview, there's the occasional lull that isn't very interesting.  HighSpots does a great job of editing the shoot interview so that everything proceeds smoothly, but because of the large amount of content, not everyone will enjoy EVERY moment of it.  And finally, you better get used to seeing ""Nature Boy"" Ric Flair use Skoal Dip.  Trust me, a lot of spit goes into a few water bottles.

Keep in mind that HighSpots doesn't have access to very much footage, as the WWE owns the rights to the NWA & WCW footage.  Many shoot interviews I've watched basically go like this: the interviewer asks a question, the wrestler talks, and you the viewer better hope it satisfies your expectations.  However, on this DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER presentation, the interviewer (I caught his name is Michael) is a North Carolina native, and isn't afraid to engage in real dialogue with Ric Flair.  Rather than Flair just running his mouth, you get the sense that you are in the same room as the man, and that he is speaking to you.  ""Nature Boy"" Ric Flair has indeed seen and done it all.  If you weren't convinced of that by the WWE's own Ric Flair DVDs, then DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER will engrave it in your mind, whether you like it or not.  Flair is not my favorite wrestler, but he was in more of a pivotal point in the business than some give him credit.

I highly recommend this DVD set to anybody interested in listening to a true pro wrestling legend take us on a deep and thought-provoking trip into wrestling's past.  DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER doesn't have any matches, and very few clips & photos.  But Ric Flair has given us something even more valuable: an uncensored journey into his heart & soul.  Priceless!

***I also highly recommend two WWE DVD sets: ULTIMATE RIC FLAIR COLLECTION (3 discs of superb wrestling), and RIC FLAIR & THE FOUR HORSEMEN (more behind the scenes, but equally thrilling for both fans who lived the 80s, and for those of us who would give anything to have been there).  I personally don't care for RIC FLAIR: THE DEFINITIVE COLLECTION, but it does compliment this shoot interview pretty well in the end.***",1227571200,9,10466,4.772651473040578
