It's an amateurishly shot presentation with a flip board.  Lungold shows off his drawings skills (which are pretty strong) but that's about it.

Reading his bio I see where he was involved in Scientology for a time.  This is probably where he learned that money could be made on religio-scientific gobledegook. Do not buy!  Do NOT even watch for free unless you want to waste a couple of hours of your life!",1500508800,,582,4.548076923076923
8146250,3,B000ILYZ3O,"Interesting facts and put across very well, but I didn't realise it was just a 'seminar' format.
Ian Xel Lungold seems like he was a very charismatic man and a shame his life was cut short by such an insidious disease.",1347408000,,218,4.341463414634147
8146251,5,B000ILYZ3O,"The content of this presentation series has been pivotal in furthering my understanding of Mayan culture, the Mayan calendar and its link to key points through history, and dispelling the myths surrounding 2012. If you are interested in learning about these ideas in depth do not hesitate to watch this!! I have not been able to find information on these subjects in such detail anywhere else. 5 Stars+.",1269302400,2,403,4.9411764705882355
8146252,4,B000ILYZ3O,"Excellent information once you sit through the rather dry flipchart presentation. The DVD packaging is very deceptive - full of wonderful color graphics, none of which make an appearance in the DVD. I would like to know the difference between this and the other Solving the Mystery of the Mayan Calendar by the same Ian Xel Lungold?  Anyone know?",1170806400,3,346,4.864406779661017
8146253,1,B000ILYZ3O,"One of my kids has been studying the Maya at school. Since many of the resources there are not current, I wanted to provide her with a visual learning tool with the most up to date information. I bought this DVD set because of the release date, the description, and the cover image. When it arrived, I was excited to see what I thought were screen shots on the back containing scenes of a Mayan temple, glyphs, and modern computer graphics. Very deceptive packaging, IMHO.

Unfortunately, both DVD's are simply Ian Xel Lungold, in front of a class, giving a lecture with a black marker and a large pad of paper. I'm certain it was loaded with good information, but it was so dry I had to fast-forward through it or suffer flashbacks to the worst of my college days. It certainly won't hold the attention of my kid.

So if you are looking for information without any bells and whistles of modern entertainment - actually with nothing but that pad'o'paper for a visual aid - you can have my copy since I can't return it because it has been opened. *sigh*",1162944000,16,1052,4.473958333333333
