8663520,1,B00L32DD0I,"This Blu-ray version is a complete farce. What looks like a Blu-ray ripped from an old VHS copy, this release is a joke. Stay away and buy a gift for someone you love with the fifty bucks it costs for this turkey. Hopefully this will get the transfer it so truly deserves as one of the best ghost stories put to celluloid.",1459555200,6,322,4.209677419354839
8663521,2,B00L32DD0I,"I'll keep it short...This Blu-ray is not worth $50 bucks. The transfer is piss poor. There is no effort here. And this movie deserves effort, as it is a horror classic. Watch your dvd on your Blu-ray player and buy another movie from a company that respects movies. No special features either. Bah, I know the Ghost Story release  will be worth it.",1450224000,6,348,4.523809523809524
8663522,4,B00L32DD0I,"I bought this bluray of Changeling 1980 as I am a huge fan of the movie. Like others, I was disappointed in the quality. However, the quality is still far better than the DVD. Its an interlaced 1080i. Certainly see a lot more detail. It could be better, but as a massive fan i'm happy with finally getting a better quality version than the DVD.",1435881600,9,344,4.3076923076923075
8663523,1,B00L32DD0I,What you're looking at here is a Blu-ray disc with what looks like a 5th generation VHS rip on it. Avoid at all costs.,1432771200,16,118,3.9583333333333335
8663524,1,B00L32DD0I,"Love this movie, but without waffling on too much, and really just focusing on the quality of this bluray, there is only one thing I have to say. Stay away from it, the quality is absolutely unbearable and horrendous. Hopefully Criterion gets this in their hands and gives it the release it deserves. Big money for one BIG disappointment. I was so looking forward to enjoying this wonderful ghost story classic on bluray. Oh well, I""ll be still waiting....",1429056000,20,456,4.784810126582278
