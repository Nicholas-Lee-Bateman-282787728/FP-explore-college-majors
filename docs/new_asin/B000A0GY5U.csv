8071490,3,B000A0GY5U,"This is my honest opinion from the view of my 40 + years of Karate involvement, teaching and studies. This DVD has some interesting rare footage of a few the early 20th Century Japanese Karate Masters. It is in Black and White (with a tone of yellow to make it seem old). Some notable masters such as Master Nishiyama and Master Funakoshi are not included. The footage is silent and grainy like an old 8MM filming (for the most part). Master Tanaka and Master Enoda have some background music. Techniques are not explained. There is some footage of Karate students practicing some parts of Karate KATA (Forms)which is a waste of time. The KUMITE (Sparring)is taken from competition and demos. The KATA portion at the beginning is done outside with poor lighting and poor angle of filming. It is not an expensive DVD so that must explain the amateurish quality. I enjoyed seeing Master Kanazawa of the SKI doing SHOTOKAN KATA. Master Kanazawa is a Japanese National Treasure. A must have for those that enjoy watching early KARATE history. This DVD is for entertainment not an instructional video, which is very Cool.",1392595200,,1116,4.817708333333333
