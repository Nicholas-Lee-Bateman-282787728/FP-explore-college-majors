8764988,1,B01HD2UCA0,"I guess I thought the movie was going to go very differently. There were many different avenues the plot could have followed that led to a better conclusion than the one I watched. I usually love scary ghost found footage movies. I think the biggest issue here is the false advertising, there are no ghosts at all.",1527033600,,314,4.526315789473684

A group of people run a TV show where they set up locations to scare people. After seeing one episode, we discover the producer wants them to get darker as they set up an asylum to spook the new groundskeeper, a creepy guy who used to work there, sort of.

This is an Aussie horror film, somewhat fresh in content. Decent acting and script. More of a slasher film than horror.

8764991,3,B01HD2UCA0,"This one started out great, but took a nose dive about a quarter of the way in. I was able to predict where the movie was going. It was entertaining, but I don't think I was ever actually spooked. The masks were awful, absolutely ridiculous.",1483401600,,241,4.377777777777778
8764992,2,B01HD2UCA0,"Grim but brainless horror film suggests that the future of entertainment is snuff and that law enforcement won't be able to do a thing about it.  While shutting down a carefully hidden webstream might be a challenge for the government or law enforcement, monetizing that type of entertainment on a large scale would be easily as challenging, making Scare Campaign one of those horror films that you are clearly not supposed to think too much about.

This Australian horror film is about a television program that pranks unsuspecting people into thinking scary horror movie type situations are actually happening to them in real life--basically Candid Camera with zombies and mad killers and such.  Similar programs have existed but without much in the way of staying power as there are only so many different scenarios you can really come up with before you run out of ideas and start repeating yourself.  Put it this way--in the last 10 years how many horror movies can you name that were completely original?

Scare Campaign has been on for five seasons but they are now facing competition from a group that is doing something similar, except they kill people for real.  The network boss is so excited that these psychos have 15 million subscribers that she tells the crew of Scare Campaign to up their game for the last episode of the season or they are off the air.

This one basically lost me right about then.  While one can certainly believe that the world is going to hell in a handbasket, actual snuff films as mass entertainment is still a bit too much for me to swallow unless we are talking about some kind of Mad Max post-apocalyptic future, which we're not.  The idea that a network boss thinks actual murder is a viable idea for television entertainment is also too ludicrous for me to buy, even in a horror film.

The crew for Scare Campaign try to create their scariest episode yet in an abandoned asylum, using a seemingly unstable former employee as their dupe in an effort to up the stakes.  Things go very wrong, although not in any halfway logical way that the viewer might expect.

A smarter movie might have played with the idea of what's real versus what is being made up for the show, but Scare Campaign seems completely uninterested in going down that road, putting all of its eggs in the wobbly snuff film basket, so to speak.  If you can buy into the premise of Scare Campaign (or at least don't find the ideas underlying it offensively stupid) then you might enjoy the film, which is made with care in terms of the acting, direction and production values, all of which are undeniably first-rate.  Unfortunately, that leaves the script, which might have worked as satire or if the filmmakers had taken the time to create a world where snuff films as popular entertainment might seem possible.  But there's a huge difference between the popularity of horror films and people wanting to watch genuine honest to goodness torture and murder for entertainment--or at least I hope there is.  But maybe I'm being too optimistic.

Writer/directors Cameron Cairnes and Colin Cairnes previously made the funny and gory 100 Bloody Acres, which makes me wonder if I somehow managed to completely miss the joke this time or if Scare Campaign is as lousy as I think.  Maybe Scare Campaign will improve upon a second viewing.  If that's the case, I will gladly rewrite this review.",1478131200,3,3395,4.75298126064736
8764993,5,B01HD2UCA0,"Scare Campaign is only a short movie (77 minutes) but once it gets going it's pretty much non stop slasher fun the whole time.  It's a fun and gory slasher flick too, taking the gore killing to a lot higher level than your Hollywood slasher norm.  This one is filmed in rural Victoria (Beechworth) at an actual disused mental asylum.  It starts off like the acting is a bit average, but that's because we're watching a TV show within the movie, the acting is actually really good as far as slasher films can be when the real action begins.  That TV show is a Candid Camera type horror themed top rating show called Scare Campaign that is being pressured to up the intensity and humiliation and terror on the mark, due to a snuff online video group who are doing similar things to the show but actually killing people that of course with no boundaries, is getting millions of hits around the world. So the actors and crew of Scare Campaign wanting to keep their jobs decide to do their next episode at an old children's mental asylum.  While improvising with the mark who is an applicant for a groundskeeping job there or something like that, the actress quickly learns he is familiar with the asylum, since he used to be a patient there.  She wants to pull the plug but her director doesn't want her to, as his reactions will be the sort of thing they need for ratings.

It is a low budget but is done well.  Interestingly for a horror movie it doesn't have the normal staple of sex scenes or even nudity. It just relies on the story to tell a great horror tale.  Some of the disappointment by the short length is made up by the fact that the DVD (region 4) also comes with 44 minutes of extras where we see behind the scenes and how a lot of the gory killing scenes and their props were made.  There's also a Q & A from Monsterfest (an Australian film festival) done straight after the movie was shown there.  Granted the Q & A isn't that well filmed, probably done with someone's camera phone, and they are sitting a fair way back in the cinema in the rows to the extreme left, so the crew and actors are a fair way away, not front on and are hard to hear at times.

Scare Campaign is made by the same brothers who made 100 Bloody Acres.  The only actor you'll probably recognise would be Olivia DeJonge (The Visit, Hiding) who plays Abby, a new young actress getting her break on this new episode of Scare Campaign.  The main staple actress of the TV show Emma is brilliantly played by Meegan Warner, who has been in a few things but not stuff most people would have watched such as Turn:Washington's Spies.  I anticipate we'll see a lot more of both these actresses after this movie.  Ian Meadows (Home and Away, Rush, The Moodys) is again someone you're not likely to have seen before unless you watched those shows, but who also does a good job as Marcus the self centered career ambitious director, who cares more about his work than the welfare of his actors and crew.  John Brumpton as George (the job applicant) does a great mentally disturbed character too.

My only criticism would be I would have liked it to be a bit longer, but with Scare Campaign you're watching quality over quantity.",1471824000,,3201,4.414965986394558
