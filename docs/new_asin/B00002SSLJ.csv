7916207,2,B00002SSLJ,"Beyond the grotesque tragedy, the most important feature about the murder of Elizabeth Smart is that her killer was an expert surgeon. This show examines several theories, but we now know a lot more than Joe Wambaugh knew when this film was made. A popular theory at the time was put forward in John Gilmore's book ""Severed"". But consider the source. Gilmore interviewed a down-and-out alcoholic and bought him drinks to keep him spinning his story. Much of it has been de-bunked. Since this film, secret files from the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office have been released. We now know that a prime suspect at the time was secretly recorded in his home and said, ""Supposing I did kill the Black Dahlia? They couldn't prove it now. They can't talk to my secretary anymore because she's dead."" That suspect was Dr. George Hill Hodel.",1492819200,,836,4.8125
7916208,5,B00002SSLJ,I purchased this VHS video some time ago. It is a fascinating hour long documentary and filled to the brim with testimonials from detectives who worked the case in 1947. Included are dramatic re-enactments of scenarios. Stephen Karadjis.,1405641600,,237,5.2631578947368425
7916209,5,B00002SSLJ,basically discussed the case of the Black Dahlia. It is brief and to the point.,1167868800,2,79,4.333333333333333
7916210,4,B00002SSLJ,"It is a great review of the brutal case and current research. I have often wondered if the Black Dahlia event, was really the first murder performed by the Zodiac. There has to be  a triangle of terror, linking the three cases of the Jack the Ripper,Black Dahlia, and the Zodiac .London artist Walter Sickert had passed away ,in 1947. He is considered ,by some researchers ,to be the leading Jack the Ripper suspect. And the wealthy ,oddball art patron Dr. George Hodel ,is now suspected of being the BD killer,by even his own son,retired LAPD cop,Stephan Hodel. Beth Short lived in Vallejo(NorCal), as did the leading Zodiac suspect Arthur Leigh Allen. Their houses were three streets apart .In time the cases will show a definative connection between the three directly,i'm sure of this. The film adds more insight and raises many questions of interest for the Black Dahlia case.",1158019200,4,881,4.873333333333333
7916211,4,B00002SSLJ,"This is info to the reviewer from Marion, Ind who wanted to know if there was ever a film made on The Black Dahlia. Yes there was back in the 70's with Lucie Arnaz . It was a tv film and don't think that it was ever put on VHS. I've  been looking for it myself and they don't seem to repeat this film on tv.",1076630400,11,307,3.6515151515151514
