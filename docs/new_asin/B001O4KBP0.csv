I watched one or two of the shows with my mom and when she was done watching it i took it and watched it.  After that i bought all the seasons for myself on DVD.  I love this show.  i just got done watching the fifth season and i don't know what i'm going to do - i want more!  This was a great season, just like all the others  it's hilarious and it makes me happy everytime i watch it. if i'm in a bad mood, i can't be after i watch this show.  I'm going to miss it!!!!",1244246400,25,617,3.628787878787879

3728302,5,B001O4KBP0,"I loved watching That Girl back in the 1960's when I was a young girl growing up in the midwest. I always wanted to live in New York City, and I eventually ended up doing just that. The final series is not the best of the five years, but it is entertaining just to check out the style back then, the clothes, hairstyles, etc. Everyone has mellowed out by season five, and it is always more interesting to have conflict, which is somewhat missing in the final year of the series. Even so, I couldn't wait for it to come out so that I could complete my collection. Marlo Thomas, as Ann Marie remains one of my all-time favorite characters that I can almost claim as a role model for myself. If you grew up in the 1960's, this is a great series to own.",1243468800,3,749,4.172413793103448

You can't go wrong with Don and Ann's chemistry.. I think we all know this is a TV show while watching but to me they are as legit a couple as you will ever find on TV.. and beyond. The amount of dialogue learned for some episodes is often staggering, check out Counter Proposal the first episode of the season.. the exhaustive explanation Ann gives for not wanting to see the price or her ring and the ways around that are simply marvelous! Another plus is Shout factories continued consistent packaging and not skimping on the extras just because this is a final season. Plus the scripts are still often fairly strong for a 5th season; That Script, Counter Proposal, and Uncle Herbert come to mind.

-Chips

Where on earth did they get the crazy notion for a theme song change to this degree? I am a fan of music of this era but I have to say the new theme song is horrendous! I'm not really crazy about Ann's new shaggy mop. The show benefits from a certain innocence and looking at Ann's mop sort of reminds me of the real world of this era.. hard to explain. Lastly, I have to mention the major flop of 'That Senorita', wow, just painful to watch. The script is overly PC and poorly acted imo and tries to make a point on racial stereo-types and the very next episode they meet Uncle Herbert at the airport and are greeting by Asian tourists who all take pictures of each other. I thought it was hilarious but out of step with the message of the previous episode.",1241913600,7,1476,4.36
3728306,5,B001O4KBP0,"Don't get me wrong I really love the show but I think ABC screwed up after nurturing Ann and Don from Day one of their meeting and five years of their relationship they don't show them getting married UGH! what a let down after five years they could not film the last episode of Ann and Don getting married that has always bothered me about the series. We assume Don and Ann did get married and live happily every after, if they were real people in our world Ann would be a widow now since Don, Ted Bessell is dead in real life. Carol Brady, Florence Henederson is a tv widow with out Mr. Brady,Robert Reed, Oliver would have been a widow since Lisa, Eva Gabor died years earlier. Andy Taylor would be a widow again since Helen Crump Anita Corsait has passed too. George is without Weezy either. Funny thought if these were real people. Although Ann and Don don't tie the knot its funny to see the styles change in season five drastically namely Don and Ann's hair. And if you bought seasons 1-4 like I did you definitely want to complete your collection with season five.",1237852800,8,1072,4.391959798994975
3728307,5,B001O4KBP0,"I can't wait for the release of this last season!!  The clothes Marlo Thomas wore along with makeup and hairstyle made her a trendsetter in so many ways back in the 70's.  The character's of Donald and Ann are refreshing!  It's nice to remember a relationship based on respect and love.  NO ""hanky panky"" !! I only wish we still had such great writers and plots in today's television!!!",1233705600,10,386,4.550724637681159
3728308,5,B001O4KBP0,"Finally, we get to have the fifth and final season of That Girl! It has been a wait that is well worth waiting for! Ann finally becomes engaged to her 4 year boyfriend, magazine executive Donald Hollinger. This season features a few episodes that focus on just how serious planning to get married is for Ann and Donald.

There are great guest stars in this last season that include the great Phil Silvers playing Ann's Uncle and Cloris Leachman playing Don's sister.

This last season closes with highlights of all 5 years of That Girl, while Ann and Don remember their favorite moments together, when they are trapped in an elevator.

3728372,5,B001O4KBP0,"I loved this show the first time it aired.  (I was a small child so it was like seeing them again for the first time.  I can't attest to the editing, I can't really remember.)  I loved it again on DVD as an adult and my daughter loved it as well.  The discs were fine, no issues, picture quality was fine.  They are closed captioned.  The only thing is that I would have loved some extras, behind the scenes, interviews etc.  They did have a couple of episodes with commentary but those are not captioned or subtitled so I couldn't hear them.  I also feel that people make a lot more of it as a feminist political statement than it really was.  The main character, Ann Marie, was a single, aspiring actress who lived alone but she did depend on her boyfriend an awful lot.  She had a quality of neediness that kind of contradicts the feminist statement to a point.  It does show the beginning of the empowerment of women.  Ann stayed single longer than most women did at that time, she followed her dream and didn't always cave in to convention. This fifth season has more of the political stances than the previous four seasons, they had a few episodes that portrayed the issues but the show wasn't supposed to be political.  It was supposed to be entertaining and it was.  It was a quality sitcom about a young, single woman living in New York trying to become a successful actress in the late 60's and early 70's.  I love it.  I wish there were a couple of more seasons.",1424822400,2,1473,4.360294117647059

3728392,5,B001O4KBP0,"As a huge fan and owner of classic tv series, I think this tv series is so cute and wonderful to watch!  I would say that women would enjoy it more than men, but even my husband got tickled at a few lines he would walk in on.  The show is so refreshing.  ""Anne"" and the other characters are fervent in their patriotism, respect for others, love, doing the right thing just because it's the right thing to do, work ethic - values that seem to be deteriorating today.  The cast and sets are GREAT; the story lines are cute and funny.  I LOVE seeing Anne's now-vintage clothes and jewelry!  The sound, picture quality and packaging are GREAT.  I own all 5 seasons, watched the whole series twice and can assure you that at some point, I'll watch the whole series again.  It's truly a 5-Star purchase.  And BTW - since you have to buy each season separately, I'll post this same review for all five.  They're all worth it!",1395187200,2,918,4.347058823529411
3728393,1,B001O4KBP0,"That Girl was one of my favorite shows growing up.  Seasons 1 - 4 were great.  Unfortunately, Season 5 was a huge disappointment.  The writing and acting deviated from the other seasons.  It wasn't even funny.  I think the producers were trying to make political statements in the final season.

3728394,3,B001O4KBP0,"The old adage ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" should have been applied to ""That Girl"" in its final season.  After four glorious seasons of Ann Marie's (Marlo Thomas) innocence, puppy-like zest for life and hope-springs-eternal attitude, there were changes galore for ""That Girl.""

In this fifth season,1970/71, Ann's hair is different; gone are the trademark bangs, Donald's hair is longer, they add lyrics to the theme song, Ann has become more politically conscious with stories focusing on racism, feminism and the environment.  And in the midst of it all, Don and Ann get engaged.  Why I'm not sure, since Marlo Thomas was adamant that the show not end with a wedding...which it doesn't.  The engagement almost depresses me, since it seems to cause more arguments than good times.

Don't get me wrong; there are still a few cute episodes, but for the most part this season has such a different feel.  Some of these episodes aren't that funny to me.  The worst of the lot being the final episode; they certainly went out with a whimper.
""That Girl"" should have never been about anyone's social conscience or opinions; it just should have always been about what they gave us for the first four years - lighthearted fun.  The message was clear without beating us over the head.  This was an independent young woman making it on her own...and it was done with joy, not preaching.

Guest stars in this season include:  Danny Thomas, Cloris Leachman, Milton Berle and Regis Philbin.

The DVD quality is good for all 24 episodes.  The only bonus extra is audio commentary by Marlo and series co-creator Bill Persky.  Anyone who has listened to this on previous seasons knows that it's akin to watching paint dry.  Marlo has many talents, but commenting on her own show seems to stump her.

It's a personal judgment call on whether to get the final season.  I wanted it, because there are still a few entertaining moments and this show was so important to me in my childhood.  Others may not want to spend the money, because this season doesn't follow true to form.  ""That Girl"" is a charmer of a series, but giving the characters a trendy ""with it"" quality caused a bit of the charm to wear off.",1392595200,4,2194,4.693717277486911
3728395,5,B001O4KBP0,"This is possibly my all-time favorite series of movies. Don and Ann conduct themselves so responsively in many situations in which they could have done wrong. Of course, her father always suspects them!",1392595200,,202,5.151515151515151
3728396,5,B001O4KBP0,"Right now I am still on season 4. I haven't gotten to 5 yet but, each season that I have purchased has turned out to be fine. In fact, everything from Amazon for me has been on the money thus far. So I am confident that the conditions of these discs are just fine as always.
As far as the show is concerned, I grew up with this and have always loved Marlo Thomas. It was the favorite show of my favorite aunt at that time. Also, this is from a time when television was a good, good place to visit. A time when TV was a good baby sitter and a good communicator. Even a good educational tool. The show was well written and the people truly had talent. It also shows the mod of the times that had hit the US with the British invasion. What some people don't know is that before something came to be all the rage here it was in the UK first. And Marlo brought all of that from London to the United States on this show. It was also one of the first shows on television that would feature a relationship that was totally platonic, at a time when television was a good clean place for the family to be.
I had always missed this show and I thought it to be lost forever. But thankfully, I have it and can watch it at any time I wish. And so I watch it the way it was aired back in 1966. One episode a week. And this way I know that it will last me a long time before I have to do the re-run thing. And there are so many other shows of that time that I am currently buying as they become available.
The 1960's and 70's I think were the best times of television. It was still somewhat new, since it had only become available to the consumer in and around 1950. The censors were ever present and made sure that there was nothing there that might be considered offensive or inappropriate for children. It was the time before cable would come and really ruin many things about something that should have remained wholesome and clean for children and the family.",1390348800,2,1948,4.102094240837697
3728397,5,B001O4KBP0,"Lots of fun to watch TV that reveals a bit if history just in representing its time, and manages to have entertainment value today.  Clear video and fun",1386288000,,152,4.428571428571429
3728398,4,B001O4KBP0,"In the four years since moving to New York City, Ann Marie had come a long way, and star Marlo Thomas, decided that the fifth season of That Girl would be the last.  Opening with a new theme song with lyrics, it is clear from the jump, that things have changed significantly, as in the season opener ""Counter-Proposal"", Ann's boyfriend Donald Hollinger (Ted Bessell) proposes marriage.

With the loving couple now engaged, many of the episodes are concerned with their impending nuptials, which provides the opportunity to see whole new sides of the characters.  A more confident Ann, seems less concerned with finding a job that would make her famous.  Things remain mostly light, but one of the most emotionally touching episodes is ""A Limited Engagement"", where Donald expresses reservations about getting married.  As always, Ann's father Lew Marie (Lew Parker) is there to support his daughter, until Don comes to his senses.

Another highlight is ""Those Friars"", which features showbiz legends Milton Berle, and Danny Thomas, performing in a show with Ann Marie.  Based on an actual event, ""Super Reporter"" is a memorable episode that features Don wearing a kooky superhero costume, as he is about to receive a writing award.

In ""That King"" Ann meets a young boy who is the ruler of a foreign country, and then gets involved in a diplomatic incident.  Ann's face appears on another woman's body in a magazine centerfold, in ""I Ain't Got No Body"".  And the ever helpful Ann, unwittingly robs the department store where she is employed, in ""That Shoplifter"".

After appearing just twice in Season Four, Bernie Kopell makes a prominent return as Don's best friend and co-worker Jerry Bauman, appearing in 8 of the 24 episodes.  Newcomer Alice Borden becomes the third actress to play Ruth Bauman, while James Gregory has a reoccurring role as Mr. Adams, Don't boss at Newsview magazine.  Sadly, Rosemary De Camp, who played Ann's mother for four seasons, is completely absent in Season Five, so Ann never gets to share the experience of being engaged with her mom.

Marlo Thomas was adamant that the series would close without the traditional storybook ending that so many were hoping for, a marriage between Ann and Don.  While Thomas is to be admired for her principles, the series ends with a thud, rather than on an enthusiastic high.

Although never too heavy handed, That Girl continued to deal with social matters, exploring the issues of racial stereotypes, women's liberation, gender roles, ageism, and environmental concerns.  Writers Saul Turtletaub and Bernie Orenstein assumed creative control of the writing in Season 4, and while the program did venture into new territories, the quality of their writing was spotty.  Being men, they did not have the same sensibilities as Ruth Brooks Flippen, the script consultant in the second and third seasons.  Responsible for writing about half the episodes in Season Five, Turtletaub and Orenstein deliver some absolute winners like ""A Limited Engagement"", and ""Counter-Proposal"", but also produced some rather mediocre stories, particularly the series closer ""The Elevated Woman"", which features a series of flashbacks from episodes in Season One, and has Ann questioning Don's devotion to her.  After five years, it's a pretty weak way to conclude this wonderful series.

Shout Factory's release maintains the same packaging motif, but with some softness, and less than vibrant colors, image quality isn't as good as the earlier seasons.  The only extra is a single commentary featuring Thomas and co-creator Bill Persky.  Unfortunately after five seasons, they still seem unaware of what most fans are looking for in a commentary track.

With a gutsy Marlo Thomas shouldering much of the responsibility, That Girl contributed greatly to the evolution of women's roles on television, blazing a trail that other programs would follow.  Thomas and Ted Bessell (1935-1996) were absolutely wonderful together, and the romance between Ann and Don that began with a magical sense of innocence, matured into one characterized by understanding and love.  Poised to enter a new phase in life, Ann Marie was no longer that naive girl from Brewster, with stars in her eyes, but had come as far as Marlo Thomas was prepared to go.  Definitely ahead of her time, Thomas achieved much, both as a very talented actress, and as feminist role model who perhaps has yet to receive the recognition she is due.",1379808000,2,4452,5.096418732782369

3728420,4,B001O4KBP0,"I felt happy and sad after buying the final season of That Girl on DVD. Reruns of That Girl kept me sane during the cold, bitter winter of 2006! I spent over $300 so I could own all five seasons on DVD. In Season Five of That Girl, Ann Marie and Donald get engaged to be married. Guess how the show ends? Ann Marie has gone from a Jackie O' haircut to silky, black hair. Donald's hair is longer. The instrumental That Girl theme now has lyrics. Marlo Thomas played a stereotypical Chinese woman on Bonanza. In Hong Kong Nocturne(1967) and Hong Kong Rhapsody(1968), starlets Cheng Pei Pei and Li Ching look like Marlo Thomas! If That Girl had stayed on the air until 1979, we'd see Ann and Donald dancing to disco music or seeing a screening of Star Wars(1977)! I guess it was good that the show ended in 1971. By 1971, Marlo Thomas wanted to move on to other projects. She was in the drama Jenny(1970). She was in the It's a Wonderful Life remake. She made an uncredited cameo in Deuce Bigalow Male Gigalow(1999). Ted Bessell died in the mid 1990's. He wanted to direct a That Girl movie. He was also in a short lived TV show where Patty Duke played a female U.S. President in an alternate timeline. That Girl was spoofed on SNL, The Nanny and Animaniacs. That Girl was a classic TV show.",1368316800,5,1288,4.348547717842323

3728422,3,B001O4KBP0,"I love That Girl, but season 5 was a let down, and it was time for it to end.  The original show was about a young woman trying to make it as an actress in New York, and all the kooky misshaps she had along the way. Ann Marie had a sweetness and innocence that was lost by the series end.  The show became more about Thomas' personal viewpoints on women's lib and racism than about comedy.  She seemed more shrill and demanding than the lovely, adorable woman she was at the beginning.  TV had changed a lot from 1966 to 1971, and it seemed like the  producers and star wanted to be more hip than funny.

It was the hair change too.  That Girl will always be Ann with bangs and the flip.  Donald was much more appealing clean cut than with longer hair and a purple leisure suit.  Thomas seemed too glamorous with long hair to get her toe stuck in a bowling ball or sell shoes meant for the dead; scripts that made the first few seasons so memorable.  Not having the characters get married didn't make sense.  If you don't want the audence to get the impression that you have to get married, why have them get engaged, since that leads to marriage, so you're still giving them the same message?  A wedding would have been a nice two part ender to the show.  They could have done a lot of funny stuff about Ann almost missing the wedding, a la Rhoda, and bringing back Judy and Leon.

The show had a number of continuity issues over the years;  Ann and Don go to Conneticut when Jerry marries Margie, with no explanation as to why he's then married to Ruthie being one, but it made a huge blunder in season 5.  Ann is nervous about meeting Don's parents for the first time, but she had already met them numerous times before.  She met them for the first time when Don's mother mistook her for Sheila, the soap opera character she was playing, then when Don's pants were in her closet, and then when the families spend Thanksgiving together.  How could the cast and producers have missed this?  They could have just said she was nervous about meeting the rest of the family.",1347840000,9,2071,4.318652849740933
3728423,1,B001O4KBP0,"If I'd known how horrible the 5th season of That Girl was, I would never have purchased it.  I would have watched it from netflix  to know how it ends, and saved my money. I like to have complete sets of certain shows, and greatly enjoyed seasons 1-4, but I would not have been sorry to stop at season 4 for this show.  Good grief, talk about over doing it.  Every skit was just too too much, and Ann was portrayed as too too stupid. It's worse than those old Lucy shows for pete's sake.",1339891200,2,487,4.094736842105263
3728424,2,B001O4KBP0,"I love That Girl--it's on my top ten list of all time--but this was a bad final season that took the show off in new directions that made it almost unwatchable. Beyond  the new Marlo Thomas hairstyle (yuck!) and the fact that her dad was in few episodes (replaced it seems by Don's boss with more focus on his workplace) was the attempt by the writers to make the show ""hip"" by doing contemporary topics instead of character comedy. The result is that there are full episodes with nothing funny about them, especially the closer they get to the end.

It is filled with guest stars who are usually misused (Joe Flynn as Lew's brother? Seriously?). Look for Jennifer Aniston's dad in one episode, which is ironic since Marlo went on to play Jennifer's mom on Friends!

By the time it gets to the final episodes (about a bachelor party, horse racing and Ann picketing Newsview with an ecology group) Marlo Thomas is overacting to the point of hysteria, saying lines that are stupid and not funny. Sorry, That Girl lovers--don't claim every episode is great. The first four seasons were wonderful fun. This is a sad ending to a great series.",1338681600,10,1137,4.618811881188119

3728427,4,B001O4KBP0,"I've watched all 5 seasons and really like the show. Great plots and great dialogue.

Only issue: The DVD extras are few and the commentary is Marlo watching the show for the first time in 20 years and making comments like she never saw it before.  She should have watched it and done some research to at least actually know the names of the people she was talking about.",1307404800,,371,4.36231884057971

3728449,5,B001O4KBP0,"I loved all 5 years of this show.  I was in my mid-teens when the show originally aired and I was in front of the television for each episode.  Marlo, I doubt if you will see this, but you were my first Hollywood crush.  The situations are funny.  The acting is stellar.  I recommend this to all who are looking for good, family entertainment.  And those outfits!!!  Wow.  Pure 60's and fab.  Marlo even makes a comment on an interview on the DVD, forgot which season, but she commented on the clothes and laughed about wearing a different outfit for practically each scene and raising the question, ""How could she afford those clothes being a struggling actress?""  But it didn't matter.  Clothes aside, this is a great show.",1294012800,5,725,4.5859375
3728450,5,B001O4KBP0,"I know , there was no season six.

But after so many great seasons , it is sad indeed to see ""That Girl"" at only 5 seasons.

Still , at least we have that.

If your a fan of the sixties or just like sixties tv , then this whole series is for you.

That Girl , will you be my Valentine ? LOL :)",1265673600,2,293,3.4615384615384617
3728451,3,B001O4KBP0,"The release of these DVDs bring back some great memories; however, I was let down a bit by Marlo's commentaries. I realize that, forty years on, she has quite a body of work behind her; yet as a fan you wait to hear such things as, ""I remember this!,"" or ""I remember Ted Bessell did this during shooting this scene..."", but she speaks about Ann Marie in the 3rd person, occasionally pointed out some dresses she liked, or that, ""Teddy Bessell was so thin then."" Her commentaries seem to suggest she has no independent recollection of the shows, so in that sense it will be a let down for fans and you may question the value of the commentaries.",1261958400,14,644,4.420168067226891
3728452,5,B001O4KBP0,I bought all the dvds. I have watched Season 1. 4 more to go! What a great family show. I watched this show with my mom back in the 90's. It used to be played on tv. I am in my mid 20's now and it is just a great show. Just shows you no matter what age you are it caters to everyone. It puts me in a happy mood. It seems times were more happier back then. Now they only have garbage on tv. What a shame! So don't worry and check this dvds out you will not be disappointed!,1258329600,7,472,3.6372549019607843
3728453,4,B001O4KBP0,"I love all 5 seasons and Marlo too, but the comentary from Marlo Thomas is sad and distant.  She acts as though she was not even on the show and does not remember anything that went on.  Instead of giving us some background information about the show, she barely comments.  She just laughs, I can do that on my own.  (Were you there . . . this is your charactor!) She could tell us about her hair style change or etc.  I would have rather her not give any input than what she said.  Bill Persky on the other hand, who is by the way older, is refreshing and tries to give us something.  With that said, I still enjoyed the 5 Seasons and would purchase them again.  Just don't play the comentary!",1255996800,5,694,4.165413533834586

3728458,5,B001O4KBP0,"I am so very happy that all seasons of That Girl"" are now on DVD.  It is still very funny, both Ted and Marlo are great with physical humor and have great chemistry.  I enjoy it even more than I did when this was on TV!  I'm amazed at how well Marlo and the costumer chose her wardrobe, because nearly everything that she wears would look well, 44 years after the show began.  It doesn't smack of cheesy sets as many series of the '60s and '70s do.  Just the thing to see when you've had a bad day.
In time, this should become a classic series, like ""I Love Lucy.""  You love the characters and you can see how well they interact.  I've enjoyed watching this with young children.  Buy this today!!",1244332800,3,696,4.180451127819549
