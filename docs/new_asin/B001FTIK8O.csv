8302709,5,B001FTIK8O,"It's the legend of Faust, with a French happy end, no deep German drama. But the main interest is to watch Michel Simon and Gerard Philipe changing characters and interacting.
The happy ending may be trivial, but there are many great moments and notions (men can say no to evil!) nonetheless provided by Rene Clair. Gerard Philipe recovering youth again, Michel Simon calling on Lucifer: there won't be such actors or scenes any more.
I saw the movie first time at about 20, and I still (at 70) think it's superb - especially after teaching Goethe's Faust for decades.
It's a movie for the Philipe-Simon's fans. Even if your French is rusty (no, no subtitles) you understand every word: the dialogue is not too sophisticated, and the elocution is superb. Another long-gone-by quality.
The transfer has but superficially been cleaned up, alas, transfer and sound are rather poor. But the other copy I have (by Gaumont) isn't any better. So take it or leave it. If you take it you get another great movie in this set box with Gerard Philipe.",1361232000,2,1039,4.745856353591161
