5547,5,0767803434,"I saw this movie with my new wife the night before we flew to Egypt on the first stage of our honeymoon, and I am grateful to her for letting me watch it! It is superb. Oh, I wish Bill Clinton was more like Mr. Ford's fictional Pres! Definitely a movie to watch before flying, if you're up to it. The action scenes, production, special effects, musical soundtrack by the stalwart and excellent Jerry Goldsmith and the photography are first rate. The story is a bit silly, I mean this couldn't happen in real life, Russian renegades invading AF1 posing as reporters, but what the hell, it's just a movie!  END",898214400,,608,4.4774774774774775
5548,5,0767803434,"When I saw ""Air Force One"" in the theater, I remember distinctly the movie gripping hold of me (when the plane was taken over) and not letting go until the very end.  While not as intense the second time around, ""Air Force One"" on DVD doesn't disappoint.  There are plenty of points in the movie that left me squirming in my seat.  The movie isn't perfect as a movie: the opening scene is way too violent (and glorified at the same time) and towards the end, where the VP rips up the paper authorizing her to take power (I liked it but most people probably don't think on such a symbolic level), the movie fizzles a bit.  But as far as being entertaining, ""Air Force One"" is by far the very best.  END",896832000,,701,4.2406015037593985
5549,4,0767803434,"Absolutely one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  Especially when the 747 drives through the ramp and parking area, skidding around corners, making 'vroom vroom' noises.  Hilarious.  END",889401600,,193,5.366666666666666

5571,5,0767803434,"It's difficult to take seriously any film in which the President of the United States manages to lay waste to a whole bunch of hijackers without so much as loosening his tie, but then again Petersen's movie is so full of such inconsistencies that you go along with it in spite of itself. Ford is the Pres, the only man who can save his titular planeload of cronies - plus, of course, his wife and daughter - from the sneering Oldman and his terrorist buddies. A very silly picture, but an ultimately thrilling one; taken as a big dumb slice of popcorn entertainment it more than delivers the goods.",1487116800,,598,4.495412844036697

5585,5,0767803434,"What we'd all like to see...the president of the US of A going mano a mano with terrorists.

When Air Force One is infiltrated and overtaken by terrorists, the persident is hustleld into his escape pod and sent on his way...or so everyone thinks. Instead, he gets out and the pod flies empty while the commander-in-chief uses the skills that won him the Medal of Honor to outwit those holding his staff and family hostage.

It's best not to think too strongly about the feasibility of the plot or the action but simply sit back and enjoy the violence, action, and heroics.  There's plenty of violence of both the good and bad kind as most of the  Secret Service is picked off one by one, some of the staff get killed and a couple throw themselves in front of bullets meant for the President.  There's a bit of quibbling going on as the people back in Washington argue over who's now in charge, some wanting to shoot the plane out of the sky, others wanting to wait and see before acting.

With an allstar cast, from Harrison Ford, Glenn Close as the Vice Prfesident who shows a little more levelheadedness than some of the other staff members, Xander Berkeley, Gary Coleman, Paul Guilfoyle, and William H. Macy, this is a well-acted, well-plotted movie which will leave the audience breathless. Fox TV called it a ""wild ride,"" and it's that in more ways than one, especially the plane-to-plane rescue scene. The special effects are great.

The idea that all those trained secret service agents could fire so many bullets in such close quarters and not even stop one hijacker is pretty unlikely. The agents were not very good at taking cover either.  Plus, even though it is just a movie, seeing all those guys get shot in the takeover scene is hard to watch.",1457654400,,423,4.565789473684211

5652,5,0767803434,"Air Force One (1997) is a relentlessly paced thriller that is still very pertinent to the dilemmas faced (or depending on one's point of view, not faced) by present American leadership in a hostile and ambivalent world.  Though the underlying scenario is a bit outdated (ala 1990s), the themes are still engaging.  Harrison Ford turns in a nuanced and very skilled performance.  He is backed by several other strong actors, including a rather young Glenn Close acting as Vice President.  Liesel Matthews is remarkable as a 12 year old ""first daughter"" and Wendy Crewson is believable as First Lady.

Plotting of the movie isn't perfect.  There are a few loose ends, but I won't spoil viewers' experience by discussing them at length.  Suffice it to say, there are some rather implausible acts by peripheral characters.  But overall, the story holds up well.

As a footnote, I would also add that I cannot imagine any US Presidential candidate in the current group of right wing crazies, panderers and political hacks, taking the public stand that Harrison Ford does as the President in this story.  His ""Be Afraid"" speech and the reasons behind it (""because it's the right thing to do"") are long overdue from the leadership of our country.",1455321600,,1239,4.913461538461538

5773,5,0767803434,"This movie now seems dated, it is now 18 years old. The first 747 was used as ""Air Force One"" in 1990. When this movie came out ""Air Force One"" had been a 747 for only 7 years. Now it has been 25 years since ""Air Force One"" has been a 747.  In 2023 the new Aircraft that will serve as Air Force One will be a 747-8.  When the last 747 was delivered it was based on a 747-200 at the time it was delivered the 747-400 was being delivered. The 747-8 has the same type rating as the 747-400 they both have no flight engineer. The new Aircraft being used for Air Force One may be modified to have a flight engineers position, because it will undoubtedly have many more systems than a regular 747-8.  It will essentially have a type rating unto itself and its twin(s).  That is, no 747-8 rated pilot would be qualified to fly Air Force One.  Piloting Air Force One is a prestigious job, although it is boring. There are Air Force pilots that don't want the job. Many former Air Force pilots won't work for the Air Lines for the same reason.  It's like being a Formula One Car driver and then getting a job driving a Trailways Bus.",1447891200,,1124,4.15668202764977

5819,3,0767803434,"Die Hard on Air Force One with the President of the United States as John McClane?  This one has easily one of the most ludicrous high concepts of any high concept action movie from the past 30 years.  When it played in theaters I hated it--and I'm a huge fan of action pictures, although not of star Harrison Ford.  At that time I would have given Air Force One a one star review.

In light of the fact that the screenplay was by Andrew W Marlowe, the creator of Castle I decided to give the movie another shot and I have a slightly different take on it now.  Given the cheeky tone of his television show, which takes nothing, least of all murder seriously, I'm inclined to think that the script for Air Force One was written as a tongue-in-cheek commentary on dumb Hollywood action pictures rather than an actual dumb Hollywood action picture.

The problem is that native German director Wolfgang Peterson (Das Boot, The Perfect Storm) while tremendously talented is not known for his sense of humor or light touch.  He has an uncommonly good eye for widescreen visuals and old-style you-can-clearly-see-everything-that's-happening approach to his action scenes but he directs Air Force One with way too much gravity, making whatever humor that manages to survive seem campy and unintentional.  It's hard to ultimately made the action set-pieces in Air Force One exciting given Wolfgang Peterson's approach since it's simply not possible to take any of them as seriously as he apparently does.

I'm not suggesting that Air Force One should have been directed as a comedy but there's a lighter approach in the films of fellow countryman Roland Emmerich (Independence Day; 2012; White House Down) that would have been perfect here.  Emmerich knows how to direct ridiculous material in a way that allows it to be silly and fun but still exciting--he knows he's making silly pulp films and embraces the humor of the ridiculous cliffhangers while allowing the audience to laugh without guilt and still enjoy the action and suspense.

For a practical example of what I'm talking about assume you are in the mood for a disaster movie--would you rather watch Wolfgang Peterson's technically well-made and lavish but dull Poseidon or Roland Emmerick's deliriously ludicrous but exciting and funny 2012?  The choice is obvious for me--but I was also a big fan of Emmerich's White House Down which I couldn't even get any of my friends to even watch, so what do I know?",1437609600,,2460,4.858851674641149
5820,4,0767803434,Good action movie from the 90s. I liked it. Harrison Ford was great. The rest of the cast is full of big names and they do a nice job as well in their limited roles. There's not a ton of character development. It's an action movie so that's ok by me.  I meant to see it almost 20 years ago now but I'm using amazon instant video to catch up on all of the action movies that I meant to see along time ago but didn't. With the instant video I don't have to spend the money on buying a blu ray and waiting for it to get here.

It's as if his sole reason for getting up in the morning is to entertain, and this he has been doing like no one else for 40 years.

Ford is the President, flying from Moscow aboard the presidential airplane back to Washington, along with his family and many staffers. The plane has not been in the air long when Gary Oldman, (excellent as always), pops up as the leader of a gang of Russian terrorists who hijack the plane, hellbent on having the President release a hostage who is a general and folk hero. Of course, the US does not negotiate with terrorists -- or does it?

The Oldman-led terrorists are vicious, but not brilliant. They completely lose track of the president, and he manages to escape into the belly of the plane. His family and staff don't know where he is, either. He manages to use his cell phone to call the White House -- whether that would work or not, I don't know. In any case, he and everyone in the Situation Room devise a plan to neutralize the bad guys and rescue the good guys. It may be far-fetched, yet clichd, predictable stuff, but a good cast, entertaining story and pretty good dialogue make it seem less so.

Ford mutters to himself better than any actor, and he gets to do a good bit of that while he's below decks. He is always a step ahead of the terrorists, and he and Oldman face off well. There are some nice little twists and turns.

Don't expect a tremendous amount from ""Air Force One."" and it won't disappoint. The most startling difference in movies like this made in the late 1990s and those made in the mid-2010s is in the special effects. CGI has completely changed the look of movies, and allows for much greater suspension of disbelief. The action sequences in ""Air Force One"" would have benefited from the now-ubiquitous process, but you can't work with what you don't have.",1426118400,,2094,4.473821989528796

5916,2,0767803434,"Short on plot; long on violence for its own sake. I was disappointed in the way it ended; never getting Harrison Ford on Terra Firma. The only memorable line, ""Get off my plane"" didn't warrant a rating higher than two stars, and wasn't enough to make it worth watching a third time (I watched it twice to see if I might have missed further enjoyment, but I didn't). They cast Wendy Crewson; one of Canada's greatest actresses as First Lady, and gave her nothing to do but cower in the corner acting timid. And Glenn Close as Vice President was a commendable choice; if only she hadn't bowed to all the men, even the discussion over the 25th Amendment lacked the anticipation one might expect in the given situation. This film was cast w/ some of the greatest talents; its just too bad they were let down by what I feel was so weak a script.",1426032000,2,840,4.391025641025641

The picture and sound are just great. Widescreen glory here. Sony has done an awesome job with the discs on either side in package. I love both these actors and am proud to have these in my Blu-ray library and you will, too!
IN THE LINE OF FIRE ~ Clint Eastwood is a Secret Service Agent assigned to protect the President. One deranged man (John Malcovich) is determined to bring down the President at any cost. Renee Russo plays a witty agent and co-worker alongside Clint. (It's one of his best movies.)
AIR FORCE ONE ~ Harrison Ford plays the US President that vows he will not negotiate with terrorists. The President's plane is (somehow) hijacked, (a task that would be impossible), and with time running out he must decide on family or the Country.

6261,2,0767803434,"How this movie received positive reviews and generated $300,000,000 is a complete mystery to me. I have enjoyed Harrison Ford's films since childhood, but ""Air Force One"" is complete and utter cheese. The special effects are laughably bad, from Air Force One's ridiculous evasive ground maneuvering, to the Fax Lady's & friends' comfy-happy-no-fear parachute jumps, to the painfully fake fighter windshields, to the crappy green-screen hand-to-hand battles on the rear loading ramp, to the 64-bit video-game quality mid-air fueling sequence, to the preposterous ten-second-per-person rope transfer to the C-130, to the cartoonish breakup of Air Force One into the ocean. Bad. I mean REAL bad, made-for-TV-movie quality effects. I also fail to understand how multiple terrorists could take out multiple secret service agents in their initial assault, yet they timidly refused to enter the belly of the plane to take out one remaining agent (who was actually the president). I also don't understand how FIVE Mig jets would fail to destroy a gianto, relatively slow-moving jumbo jet after they would clearly detect F-15 fighters closing on their position. The only redeeming quality of the film was Gary Oldman's commitment to his performance, and Harrison Ford's usual awesomeness. However, even their epic acting chops cannot overcome the royal cheesiness of this nuclear cheesoid of a cheesy action flick. CHEESE. FAMUNDA CHEESE.

6268,5,0767803434,"Having concluded his talks with the Soviet Russian Premier, the President of the United States (Harrison Ford) and Member's of his Cabinet, board the President's plane - AIR FORCE ONE. What should have been a relaxing trip home, turned out to be a nightmare on a national then global scale. Russian, neo-nationalist terrorists, who wanted their General released from prison, impersonated member's of the media whom they had killed, to be able to board AIR FORCE ONE. These deranged member's of this radical group, relied heavily upon the treachery of one of the U.S. Secret Service Agents who ironically, was assigned to protect the President from just the sort, whom he was now, aiding. And his betrayal to his country, his President and his job assignment was key, to their success. With a hostile take over on the plane and with systematic hostages being executed, what was the U.S. President/The Commander In Chief, going to do? Especially since, the terrorists were demanding that the plane be re-fueled in the air and re-routed, back to Mother Russia. Thinking that the President had evacuated the plane with the emergency escape pod, the psychotic terrorists, called him a ""...coward!"" Not realizing that he was still aboard and was the only hope for the hostages and flight crew, he was secretly trying to communicate with the White House. By now, the sadistic Russian terrorists knew, that there was a mystery passenger on board who was frustrating and resisting them, successfully. The sociopathic saboteurs were being sabotaged. Meanwhile, the Vice President as played by Academy Award winning Actress Glen Close, is told by the Security Council to write the President off, because he has been missing in action and as of yet, they hadn't heard from him. In this fast paced action drama, you will be at the edge of your seat if not on your feet, with plenty of adrenaline pumping through you, cheering for the President. So, riveting is this film. You are either with the terrorists or with the President. For the Americans or for the Russians. For freedom or for tyranny. There is no middle ground with this movie. And the Secret Service Agent who betrayed the United States, the innocent American hostages, the President, his Secret Service colleagues and his job assignment? Does he ever get his...!! How? Well, you'll just have to watch the movie for yourself and see. It makes for compelling viewing that will make an American Patriot out of you..., if you aren't one already. God Bless the United States of America, it's people, the President and this Great Land and all of it's National freedom's and personal liberties.

Although the President continues to refuse and give-in to the bad guys out of preserving our nation's dignity, his family and all passengers aboard may die. The terrorist demands are serious, and the bad guys mean business, as time begins to run out for the President.

The suspense becomes intense as you sit on the edge of your seat to witness who will win, and who will die. One passenger was already killed, and the President must act quickly with major decisions. An action-packed thriller with intense suspense! Highly recommended to all those who enjoy thrillers!",1410480000,,1100,4.809523809523809

6294,5,0767803434,"I really like this film and will watch it again and again.  Harrison Ford plays a very determined President.  He's determined no to sit by and do nothing when terrorists destroy other countries; he is determined not to negotiate with terrorists; he is determined to save his family and other hostages when terrorists take over Air Force One; and very determined to get their leader off his ship and tells him so.  After that, he's determined to send as many as possible to safety before the ship breaks apart upon impact with the ocean.  He does accomplish his goals with the help of his cabinet via phone calls or fax machine when he is not dodging bullets in various parts of the plane.  Glen Close plays an equally determined Vice President trying to get all the hostages free and save President and his family.  Gary Oldman plays a terrorist leader who is determined to lead Russia into a new Golden Age of power and glory and plans to undermine the President's new policy of not negotiating with terrorists by threatening to kill his family.
  I have always liked Harrison Ford movies and this is a definite keeper to be watched over and over again.  I liked the fact that I could choose to watch it either wide-screen or full-screen.  This is a movie that needs to be seen in wide-screen. All fans of Harrison Ford will undoubtedly like this film of a man determined to live by his convictions, only to be challenged to dig deep to find the strength and courage to do so when the unthinkable happens.  Those who like a good action adventure will like it as well because it is full of action with fights in a plane being wildly flown, bullets flying everywhere, people either parachuting or falling out said plan, and other adrenaline rush scenes.  You too will want those terrorists off the President's plane.",1410220800,2,1815,4.61993769470405

6308,2,0767803434,"Who does not worship at the altar of the evil incarnate Gary Oldman? OK
given his ""Immortal Beloved"" venture, went against type but he
represents the zenith of scare tactics even with the most insipid of
actors, Harrison Ford. You can tell he did not know what hit him when
his eyes realllly bugged out in all of the strangleholds by Oldman.
Ford was in real pain and fear and I was cheering, FINALLY a real
emotion from this one noter.

The only dialogue worth mentioning was the reference to killing 100K
Iraqis to affect pump price reductions. This sentimental ""USA All the
Way"" notion would fall on deaf ears today given the lowest ratings for
leadership. I am confident we would be overjoyed with a huge military
base from China near Los Angeles. There are approximately 800 'known'
bases around the world, that is some kinda democracy imho.

Where did they discover the FAX Lady? She was awarded PostMaster
General for sending a 3line FAX, and she LOVES Skydiving! I believe
that honor would be best bestowed to the President's daughter, she had
it all under control. Another astute observation is the Russian
actors sure were good looking and hard to view as enemies, they even
work out! However, not enough for that savage cunning 53YO President
who kicked a$$ in 'Nam 30+ years prior.

I respect the director for his other projects, i.e. Das Boot, unclear
how he would accept this dirge of gratuitous.... you name it, they had
it. Consequently, hilarity ensues with this many hits and more misses
than is conceivable. Congrats Hollywood!

Sharon Stone.",1407801600,,1629,4.786476868327402

I watched this movie with my ultra religious, Pentecostal father a few years ago, and he really enjoyed it.

Harrison portrays one of the best examples for a Hollywood President in a long time, very straight forward and to the point. He's ex military, so when Gary Oldman hijacks the plane, the president is forced to rely on his training and save the day. But its not quite that simple.

Gary Oldman, he plays such an unlikeable character, he's as good as Alan Rickman was in 'Die Hard'.

I do admit having Harrison Ford play the U.S. President is an odd casting choice...it leaves no doubt that he's gonna be right in the middle of that action, kicking butts and taking no prisoners...unfortunately, there's little surprise in that area as well.  Gary Oldman was a complete surprise as the leader of the terrorists hijacking Air Force One.  Oldman was wonderfully menacing throughout, showing us he was capable of anything, no matter how cold-blooded.  While I question the premise of someone actually managing to hijack Air Force One, I still very much like this film and watch it over and over again.

6462,4,0767803434,"I saw this film for the first time in theaters with my aunt and a friend, at the time, bad move!(long story) I'm much more analytical now with movies, most of the time. Harrison Ford does a very good president who has a no-nonsense approach to terrorism, led by a cold and merciless terrorist Gary Oldman. The plot is fairly easy to follow, and composer Jerry Goldsmith, who I'd swear Saw composer Charlie Clouser took some tips from) once again has an excellent musical score. Even though I do enjoy this film, I do have a couple issues with it: first, I know Gary Oldman is the primary villian in this film, and the script makes him very easy to hate, more with actions and facial expressions. However, he isn't the only character I couldn't stand, Dean Stockwell as the Defense Secretary, how pathetic, in this case. Aside from Harrison Ford, Glenn Close, the wife played by Wendy Crewson from Good Son and daughter, some characters don't last long enough to even care about. And in movies like this, you have to know the villian has back-up, unfortunately, that cliche has gotten very old for me, along with the ""kill the witness formula"". All that aside, this also set the stage for two other similiar movies recently released in theaters, both that I watched and overall liked-Olympus Has Fallen and White House Down) This film however, seemed like a blueprint for those films, even though, obviously, the new ones, seemed a lot more intense. In those films, however, at least with White House Down, the media was as bad as the terrorists! When it comes to news reporters and tabloid reporters, whatever celebrities want to dish out at them, including violence, dare I say it? Bravo! Esp. when they are so relentless and don't care who they hurt to get their story, remember Princess Dianna? Don't even get me started!",1374364800,,1824,4.703125

This movie is about heroes, more specifically the President of the United States, played beautifully by Harrison Ford. He is a man of strength, character, and wit, and must save his crew from hijackers. When this movie first came out, the story seemed very disturbing to me: a movie made in the U.S. about hijacking our very own presidential aircraft. What a country we live in!! Gary Oldman does a stellar job as the chief bad guy, while William H. Macy is solid as usual. Is there a movie that he (Macy) is NOT in?

6547,4,0767803434,"Any resemblance between President Bill Clinton and the Harrison Ford Chief Executive in Wolfgang Petersen's far-fetched, entertaining, but woefully predictable skyjacking saga ""Air Force One"" ends when Ford's fantastic First Guy starts knocking off the villains. Nevertheless, the parallels between Clinton and Marshall appear clearly obvious. Harrison Ford's President James Marshall is married to a tenacious, headstrong wife in the Hilary mode, and they have a 12-year old daughter. (So was Bill Pullman's president in ""Independence Day."") Unlike Clinton, President Marshall flew helicopter rescue missions in Vietnam and received a Medal of Honor. No, the filmmakers refuse to identify President James Marshall's party affiliation, which make ""Air Force One"" impartially political, while it trumpets America's anti-terrorist stance.

Andrew W. Marlowe's melodramatic screenplay shows more agility than innovation. While his characters emerge as largely one-dimensional stick figures, the dimensions of their predicaments assume nothing less than cataclysmic proportions. Marlowe's script keeps Harrison Ford leaping through enough flaming hoops to fill three movies. Like several other summer blockbusters, Marlowe's script does not know when to throw in the towel. Just about everything that can happen aboard ""Air Force One"" occurs. Presumably, with the recent spate of skyjacking movies, it was only a matter of time before Hollywood appropriated both Air Force One and the President as the pulp of their fictional escapade.

The movie opens in slam-bang style with an elite American commando team parachuting into Kazakhstan at night. Using the latest hi-tech gear, they kill the palace guards and abduct an adversarial Russian leader, General Radek (Jurgen Prochnow of ""Das Boot""), who is promptly incarcerated in a Soviet hoosegow. Three weeks later in Moscow, President Marshall stipulates that the U.S. refuses to negotiate with terrorists. Meanwhile, a ruthless ultra-nationalist Radek zealot, Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman of ""True Romance""), succeeds in smuggling his bogus TV news crew aboard the most secure plane in the world. A disgruntled Secret Service agent, Gibbs (Xander Berkeley of ""L.A. Takedown""), as we later learn, helped these guys obtain their security clearance. Once the plane is airborne, Korshunov and his men commandeer it, kill the pilots, and watch helplessly s the president ejects in his escape pod. (Does anybody remember ""Escape from New York?"") Ivan contacts the Vice President (Glenn Close) and vows to kill a hostage every half-hour until Radek walks away from prison. According to Defense Secretary Walter Dean (Dean Stockwell), Radek's release would bring down the pro-American regime in the Kremlin and bring back the Cold War, so the Russians are reluctant to set him free unless President Marshall makes the request personally for Radek's release.

The filmmakers cannibalize in typical Hollywood fashion every neat idea from all the other skyjacking thrillers. Generally, ""Air Force One"" follows the formula of the Kurt Russell hit ""Executive Decision."" Both movies start with a commando raid and then shift to terrorists hijacking a jetliner before an unconventional hero makes his entry. You can tell that Marlow evidently watch the Wesley Snipes thriller ""Passenger 57"" for one scene. Another scene features a stunt that appeared in both ""Airport 75"" and ""Cliffhanger."" The president here imitates the action heroes from the Bruce Willis ""Die Hard"" franchise and the Steven Seagal ""Under Siege"" movies. Finally, the ""Air Force One"" ending should come as no surprise to any ""Star Trek"" movie veterans. Anybody who thrives on movies like an insomniac will spot these plot elements. Although ""Air Force One"" borrows heavily from other epics, the staging of the action and some new scenes in the skyjacking formula boost this opus over the rough spots.

Anybody familiar with German director Wolfgang Petersen will recognize the affinity between ""Air Force One"" and his earlier classic U-boat thriller ""Das Boot""/""The Boat"" (1981). The casting of ""Das Boot"" star Jurgen Prochnow as the heinous General Radek aids in this comparison. Moreover, Petersen sends his highly mobile and energetic cameras plunging about the corridors of ""Air Force One"" with the same dexterity that they swept through the hull of the sub in ""Das Boot."" Despite a connect-the-dots plot, Petersen makes every dot a fire storm of intensity. The scene where the President's jet careens wildly across the airfield in Germany and nearly crashes is pretty harrowing.

Ford's presidential protagonist is basically Indiana Jones in a suit and tie. The filmmakers rely on Ford's action hero charisma to compensate for the lack of depth in his inadequately sketched head of state. Shrewdly, they shift gears to the parental side of the chief executive. Ford's best scenes occur before take-off when he asks about his favorite football game. Although Marshall emerges as a cardboard politician, it's his ""Die Hard"" courage that wreathes him with laurels. Unlike those wimpy Jack Ryan movies ""Patriot Games"" and ""A Clear and Present Danger,"" Harrison Ford's hero here kills the villains. The bad guys don't slip out of Marshall's clutches and conveniently impale themselves on sharp objects. (Remember the way the ""Patriot Games"" villain died?) Marshall runs up a body count, kills with a machine gun, snaps necks, and slugs it out with rough and tumble adversaries. Ford is one of the few male box office stars who can shed tears (when Ivan threatens to pull the trigger on his daughter) and not make it look schmaltzy. Ford manages to maintain a stiff upper lip throughout ""Air Force One"" and his scenes with bad guy Gary Oldman crackle with electricity. Ultimately, however, Ford's performance qualifies as serviceable, nothing truly special like the cop the played in ""The Devil's Own"" (1997).

The real casting coup in ""Air Force One"" is Glenn Close as Vice President Kathryn Bennett. Close manages to hold her own in a room packed with veteran male character actors like ""Quantum Leap's"" Dean Stockwell who constantly bullies Close to usurp presidential authority. Although certainly not the most original skyjacking melodrama, ""Air Force One"" manages to add elements to the formula and boasts enough visceral R-rated violence to keep you distracted throughout its 124-minute running time.",1343433600,,6406,5.4396378269617705

6549,2,0767803434,"I'm just tired of movies that have no individuality.  They don't even try to attempt something remotely original, and that seems down into their casting decisions.  How many times do we need to see Gary Oldman play a creepy villain?  Honestly, how many times do we need to see Harrison Ford play a Presidential figure of some sort?  Even Glenn Close gets type casted in those `women who wish they were as powerful as men' roles.  That is the big issue with `Air Force One', there is nothing original here.  The story is preposterous and pretty straightforward with no real stimulation.  It doesn't make a lot of sense and yet it is forgivable action fluff for the most part really.  The action scenes are effective and some of the visuals are nicely constructed, but the tension just doesn't live up upon multiple viewings, and really with a film this redundant in basically everything it isn't worth watching more than once.",1339632000,,925,4.7375

6561,4,0767803434,"Yeah, I'd vote for Harrison Ford for president. President James Marshall, to be exact. He's not only the president, he's a first class hero, as this story makes clear. Brief sketch, so as not to ruin all the surprises: there are dozens.

Air Force One, with the First Lady and First Daughter (age 12) aboard, is highjacked by a group of fanatical communists who want to restore the Soviet Union. Key to their plans is the release of their favorite general from Russian prison. One clue -- just one -- to the whole thing is pretty clear early on in the highjacking: one of the Secret Service agents guarding the president is helping the terrorists.

The leader of the terrorist highjackers is Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman) who is clearly insane, and has no qualms about killing in cold blood. Back in the White House Situation Room sits Vice-President Kathryn Bennett (Glenn Close) trying to cope with it all. Her advisers can't agree, the military folks present various pretty drastic alternatives, and the highjackers have said they will execute one hostage every half hour until their General is released from prison and they have confirmation of the fact.

OK, there's your tip of the iceberg. The rest is simply too unpredictable for me to want to spoil anything for you. See this film!",1336780800,,1289,4.797297297297297
6562,4,0767803434,One of the most memorable scenes for me was when Harrison Ford hid behind one seat but turned the neighboring seat to make it look like he was crouched there instead.

6564,3,0767803434,"AIR FORCE ONE is a fun movie. It's the kind of action movie where you can suspend your disbelief and just sit back and enjoy. And at the same time this film depicts a President that many of us really wish we actually had in the Oval Office: a politician who can literally kick some ass. Harrison Ford demonstrates that he is still a really good action hero, and is also a great actor. That acting talent goes for the opposite side of the coin in Gary Oldman. Both actors make their performances believable in this movie. Good action movies have to have a great villain. And Oldman definitely provides that in his role.

After the successful capture of Radek: a rogue Russian General who has committed genocide on his country's people, U.S. President James Marshall announces to the world in Moscow that America will not tolerate any terrorist organizations. ""It's your turn to live in fear,"" he says to the world. His National Security Advisor (Tom Everett), and Chief of Staff (Paul Guilfoyle) are not happy with this change of policy, but the president doesn't back down. Fortunately, his wife (Wendy Crewson), and his daughter (Liesel Matthews) stand by him on this belief.

Air Force One takes off from Moscow, heading back to Washington. On board is a Russian news crew who were invited on the trip. But then, everything turns to hell when one of the Secret Service agents (Xander Berkeley) kills his fellow men and unlocks a weapons cache. The news crew reveal themselves to be terrorists and quickly hijack the plane. The Secret Service manage to get the President down to an escape pod, which is jettisoned from the plane before they are killed. The terrorists believe that Marshall had escaped in the pod, and then reveal what they want. They tell the Vice President (Glenn Close) to release Radek, or the hostages will be slaughtered one by one.

It turns out that President Marshall released the pod himself and hid himself away. He understands that it is up to him to save the day. And he fights back against the terrorists one by one. Yes, at this point, AIR FORCE ONE has recycled the same plot as CON AIR, DIE HARD, and UNDER SEIGE: terrorists overpower everyone in a specific place, except for one man, who has to save the day. On top of that, it also borrows from the old AIRPORT disaster films of the 70's: something goes wrong, and now we have to get the plane back on the ground.

These kind of plots are certainly a cliche. That is true. Done wrong, they can be so incredibly ridiculous as to invite the MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 style wise-cracks. But it's not what kind of plot you use for a movie, it's what you do with it. With AIR FORCE ONE, director Wolfgang Peterson brings in a cast of very gifted actors. Harrison Ford is a great choice as the president. Gary Oldman is not only believable as a villain, he is even given some dialogue that expands on this character. After he shoots a hostage and is called a cold-blooded murderer, he retorts back with this quote: ""You murdered 100,000 Iraqis just so that you could save on a gallon of gas, and you call me a murderer?"" It's also a delight to watch Glenn Close as Vice President Bennett in the Situation Room, along with the great character-actors Dean Stockwell as the Secretary of Defense, and Philip Baker Hall as an Attorney General who advices them on what the Constitution says on the issue.

Wolfgang Peterson was determined to make the film as realistic as possible. The other terrorists are played by real Russian actors. I recognized one of them: Elya Baskin, from MOSCOW ON THE HUDSON. In that film he was the fellow circus performer and best friend to Robin Williams. (You may also remember him in the SPIDER MAN movies as Peter Parker's landlord.) In the production notes of AIR FORCE ONE the director, production designer, and Harrison Ford all went on a tour of the real plane. This film depicts the jet in almost complete accuracy. Some creative liberties were taken, of course. But for the most part, we can believe that this is what Air Force One looks like. And on top of this, Harrison Ford does all of his own stunts. He was in his mid-fifties when this film came out in 1997, but he was still in great shape. The United States Air Force actually gave full co-operation in making this film, since it's a very positive kind of movie for this military branch.

As I said before in the beginning of my review, AIR FORCE ONE is a fun movie. Then-president Bill Clinton loved it. He actually encouraged Glenn Close to play the Vice President before she was cast. I like her, and the other performances. Could such a scenario actually occur on Air Force One? I seriously doubt it. The plane does not have an emergency pod or parachutes in the back. These parts of the film are almost laughable, but it still makes for good entertainment. After seeing this movie, I began to wonder, what if we elected a war hero and Medal Of Honor winner as the President, and ended up with a beautiful woman as The Vice President?",1332201600,,5013,4.5768374164810695
6565,5,0767803434,"Air Force One is certainly not a new film but buying it in its Blu-ray edition will most definitely be a new viewing experience for you.  I do have the original DVD release, which I had always thought was pretty good, however, on Blu-ray you will find yourself on the seat of your pants almost from the beginning.  In the first takeover scene on Air Force One, the bullets go flying literally all around you. The lossless audio is just outstanding.  Too many films skimp on proper audio production but not on this disc.  There is extensive use of all five channels from front to back, side to side and diagnally through the sound stage.
The video transfer would also be hard to improve as crisp details, even in the shadows, are most apparent.  The only thing lacking in this Blu-ray version is an almost complete lack of extras.  There is a commentary extra but these are most ubiqutious and that's about all.  There are a couple of movie previews on the disc.  I hate to pay for a company's advertising and wish they had used that space for any extras that could have been there instead.
Never the less, for the video and audiophile, this is one Blu-ray DVD that can, and should, be used for any demonstration of one's system.  I highly recommend it.
All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.

6567,3,0767803434,"... whether you view it as a serious film or a comedy. As a serious film, one star. As a comedy, 5. For me, it's definitely a comedy.

See the President of the United States engaging in mortal, hand-to-hand combat with armed terrorists! Sure, he's clearly in his fifties, and going up against young, strong, trained combatants; but he's a Fighting President! And nobody, but nobody, is going to take over his plane! (He makes it clear at one point that it's ""my plane!"". Funny, I thought the plane, and the White House, etc., belonged to the people. Guess that's an outdated concept).

Meanwhile, watch the determined Vice President get off the helicopter (not sure why she was flying around in it in the first place) and whirl into action, issuing orders and taking command of the situation. Because she's a Fighting Vice President! Oh, we have a minute or two of the obligatory scene where she and the Secretary of Defense argue about who is in charge, but that's just for show. In the next scene, the Fighting Vice President is still running the show. And doing so brilliantly! Because she's not a figurehead VP, as most are; no, it's made clear that she and the president are good friends and close partners (yep -- that's realistic). Also, she looks exactly like George Washington, so she has that added gravitas. (Don't know what I'm talking about? Go to google images and enter ""glenn close air force one"". Find the picture where she's standing in front of the ""White House"" logo in the press room. Put it next to the image of Washington from a dollar bill. Compare the hair, the eyes, the nose, the lips. They could be twins).

To fully appreciate the absurdity of this movie, imagine it with our real president and veep. Look, I'll be non-partisan about it -- imagine either Obama or Bush in hand-to-hand combat with armed terrorists and killing them. My own choice would be Clinton and Gore, who were in office when the movie was made. I think ""Air Force One"" is a great comedy; but if someone would use CGI to replace Harrison Ford and Glenn Close with computer-generated Bill Clinton and Al Gore, and dub their voices in -- well, that would be, by far, the greatest comedy film of all time.",1329004800,2,2202,4.612244897959184

6570,4,0767803434,"The film is reminiscent of many an airplane, ship, railroad and, probably, even ferry boat, terror-hostage-'noted individual at risk' film; however, making it the President, gives it an extra bit of  pizzazz. Of course, Harrison Ford does his usual professional job, the nasty guys are suitably nasty, the good ones are suitably heroic, and one forgives them their excesses in the name of thriller necessity. Thriller it is, and, a good one. Lovers of the genre, accustomed to forsaking reality for the sake of enjoying a film, will like this one. I liked it. The only thing which marred it for me, occasionally was the lurking thought which would rise to the  surface before I firmly repressed it; what if we really had a President in a crisis who also ignored his oath of office so readily, had no sense of his duty to the country, what if we really had a Vice-President so unwilling to do the hard but necessary things.

6612,4,0767803434,"Director Wolfgang Petersen had previously focused on the life of the President in his film, In the Line of Fire (1993), and he returns to that subject in Air Force One (1997), a big budget, over the edge thriller, that had the cooperation of the US Government, and the personal support of President Bill Clinton.  Although Kevin Costner was originally in mind to play the President, it would be hard to imagine anyone better suited to this role at the time, than Harrison Ford (Indiana Jones).

President James Marshall (Ford) is returning from the Soviet Union, travelling with his staff and family on Air Force One, the President's custom modified 747.  While in flight, terrorists disguised as journalists, take over the plane, led by Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldham).  Secret service agents rush the President to the escape pod in the lower section of the plane.  The pod is launched, so the terrorists believe that the President has escaped, but he remains hidden aboard.

Back in Washington, Vice President Kathryn Bennett (Glenn Close), is in charge of the negotiations with Korshunov, who is demanding the release of General Radek (Jurgen Prochnow), a criminal being held in a Soviet prison.  US fighters arrive to escort AF1.  As the Government works to recover the pod, Korshunov begins to execute hostages.  The President communicates with Washington via satellite phone, restating his policy of non-negotiation with terrorists.  This signals Marshall's transition from Commander In Chief, to chief buttkicker.

Finishing as one of the top five grossing films of 1997, AF1 is a classic late 90's mainstream Hollywood blockbuster.  With a huge budget, big stars, special effects, and tons of studio backing, it is Grade A entertainment for the masses, where lovable action hero type, Harrison Ford, dons a superhero cape, and against impossible odds, Marshall saves the day.

For the film's key element, the producers researched the real AF1, as much as they could, but much about the craft remained classified.  Within that pseudo-realistic framework however, reality is seriously mangled, as Marshall travels with relative ease, and the hull is never breached by a bullet.  The terrorists are terribly inefficient, failing to take immediate control of the cockpit, and letting the President escape.  Oldman's Korshunov, is quite the patriot, when threatening women and a child, but isn't much as commander of men.  The cast also includes William H. Macy (Sahara), Wendy Crewson, Xander Berkley, Paul Guilfoyle (CSI) Dean Stockwell (Quantum Leap), Liesel Mathews (A Little Princess), and Jurgen Prochnow (Das Boot).

Wolfgang Petersen is a storyteller, that understands the effective use of action, and he provides an enthusiastic, and informative commentary.  He marvels at the amazing things that were done in the special effects department, which by today's standards, appear quite dated.  Air Force One is an overdramatic, pretentious, but fun fantasy, with a patriotic streak.  It is too bad that today's real problems can't be dealt with so simply.",1273363200,,3061,5.270103092783505
6613,5,0767803434,"This movie is so packed with action that you are on the edge of your seat through the whole show. Harrison Ford plays a fantastic role as the president, and is his usual admirable self. Good Movie!",1271808000,,197,4.351351351351352
6614,4,0767803434,"This is a movie that's nothing more than good, silly fun.  Like any ""Die Hardish"" movie, you just need to relax, enjoy the ride and not think about logic.

It's fast paced and never dull. If you enjoy over the top action movies where it seems like no matter how bad the situation is, it gets worse, this is one for your collection.

The good: The picture and sound are clean and spectacular, although the special effects show some rough edges.  The sound of the F-16s (?) flying in circles is a great way to show off your surround sound.

Now the bad: The Blu-Ray version doesn't have any extras except for Director's Commentary (which was on the DVD) and ""Blu-Ray Live.""  A serious disappointment for me!

Upon boarding Air Force One, with the hope of catching a few precious hours to himself and his T.V., the whispering President comes under attack in an attempted hijacking by Russian strong men (led by superb actor Gary Oldman).  The plot thickens as Air Force One is taken by force and makes a remarkable series of 20 wheel drifts through Rammstein Air Base Slalom Course in West Germany.  Shortly thereafter, the George Washington hair-doed Vice President (Glenn Close- I always get her mixed up with Merryl Streep!) tries to negotiate with the hijackers, but to no avail.  Since no other man will step up to the job (bloody wimps), the rubbery-faced President has to defeat the hijackers on his own.

Despite constantly looking dazed and confused, especially after kissing his robust secretary in exchange for sending a FAX, the whispering President manages to usurp the hijackers and kill their esteemed leader.  I was saddened to see the former German U-boat commander, now a General by the name of Radek, die only footsteps from freedom from a Russian prison.  William H.

6616,5,0767803434,"It still never ceases to amaze me how this high-spirited action-packed gem escaped me for all these years. My earliest recollection of this film is when I was still in grammar school catching the trailer's most infamous and notorious Harrison Ford moment when he quotes, ""Get off my plane""!. (Priceless) Now, after all of these years have passed I can at least say that this film did not disappoint as the solid acting and fast paced action held my attention throughout the film in it's entirety. Upon viewing this film in the Blu-Ray format it made me regret not seeing it in theaters in a sense. On a more positive note, this blu-ray disc truly utilizes it's full potential of technology; moreover, it's patriotic epic score composed by the one and only Jerry GoldSmith which is also accompanied by a great sounding lossless audio track will really satisfy the home theater buffs. On an even more positive note, I feel this Blu-Ray disc was not far off or short for that in matter in delivering a true realistic theater experience because it was quite superb on many levels. I will elaborate more on these technical specs later but for now I will give a very brief summary here.

President Marshall, played by a more youthful looking and middle-aged (Harrison Ford) is held hostage along with his family and staff members on Air Force One after American Special Forces capture general Rodek who is the leader of Kazakhstan. President Marshall leaves a gorgeous and enormous looking Moscow dinner hall after delivering a very brief subdued and yet powerful speech concerning terrorism and foreign policy. Upon boarding the plane we are introduced with Ivan Korshunov who is played by the versatile and ever so impressive (Gary Oldman) While Air Force One is in flight, the audience discovers a mole in the secret service that is able to board Ivan and his other supportive terrorists companions. The secret service wastes no time in starting the bloodshed as he fires two bullets into two cabinet member's heads while they were discussing and briefing on important foreign policy matters. Soon the trails of a smoke grenade released by the secret service man signal Ivan and his ultra radical friends to unleash hell on the president and everyone else on the plane; and, that is exactly what they do because they are incredibly vengeful, bitter and quite keen on releasing General Radek.

Since we are dealing with Blu-Ray technology I always feel it is appropriate and mandatory to analyze and review the technical specs because that is what we are paying top exorbitant dollar for right? If we weren't receiving an upgrade we might as well be buying VHS right?

Well I am astounded to announce that, Blu-Ray fans won't be disappointed in this department either because the picture and sound looks and feels incredibly sharp, precise and most importantly very consistent. Despite the film's age, this disc completely revives and revamps it to a more recent looking film even with the sparse and light 90's grain subtlety prevalent throughout. Fortunately, this minor set back hardly retracts or dilutes any of the overall quality of this pristine transfer. More importantly, flesh tones are smooth and detailed throughout; hair and fabric emit some fine detail particularly in the darker interior shots of the control panel sequences. The blue colored control panel scenes are quite remarkable in the sense that it really enhances facial hair and flesh tone depth to a more elevated level of clarity in any parts of the film. Personally, no other scene compares to this high level of detail in my opinion. This attribute is more specifically shown when Gary Oldman is losing his patience when he frustratingly articulates his demands to the vice president with impunity and anger. Apart from the control panel scenes, the rest of the film does not fail to deliver in expressing some vibrantly smooth scenes in the conference rooms, bag storage area as well as the smaller private rooms (Bathroom, lounge rooms). The majority of the film takes place in the interior of the plane during the night with some interwoven scenes of the white house conference rooms so you will have to keep this in mind in order to regulate any misguided expectations. (In terms of settings, not an entire amount of variety here)

The Sound is excellent, as the flawless lossless 5.1 audio will give all your speakers quite a bit of attention; the dialogue is crisp, articulate, clean and very pleasing. I was able to make out every spoken word without any complications. You will truly appreciate the opening-firing scene at the headquarters in Kazakhstan when general Rodek is captured. Moreover, AK-47's, Mp5 and Mp5k's fire and pierce with unbelievable force and dominance, but that's not even the bread and butter here folks. The automatic sub-machine guns truly immerse you in its breath taking firepower during the first plane shootout when the terrorists kill the majority of the President's staff on board. Listen carefully to the bullets ricocheting off metal stairs or penetrating through bathroom doors. I fully appreciated the gunfire sounds in the bag storage area where President Marshall hides; it is quite impressive and mesmerizing actually. One will also quickly observe how much attention is given to the sub-woofer and rear channel speakers during the exterior night shots of the plane in fight; engines will roar loudly and thoroughly producing a strong vibration in any floor of your house. As a result, this creates a very strong acoustical sound range leading the front channel speakers and gradually dissolving to the rear. The introduction of the F-16 fighter jets following Air Force One leaves no speaker unscathed; the incessant accelerating engine power might cause one to grip on to their seats. (Well, at lease for me it did) These types of aerial vehicular sounds are nicely calculated in between scenes of dialogue and dominate the last half-hour of the film. Even though I have never seen this film on standard dvd I feel it is appropriate and safe to say that this is a serious upgrade for home theater fans. Although I wouldn't say this is an outstanding Blu-Ray film, I will say it is a solid one because it delights and pleases wherever possible. In that regard, it is worth the purchase.

In regards to the acting, Harrison Ford Fans or in my case die-hard Gary Oldman fans will be impressed here. A multi-talented and quite younger Gary Oldman emits a more vengeful and retrained type of villain here as opposed to some of the former impulsive, unbalanced psychotic characters he plays. His anger is explosive and expected when provoked and his calmness is professional when in control; he practically has zero empathy for anyone on board as he kills relentlessly with his crew. Harrison Ford, on the other hand, plays a very likeable president; his assertiveness and confidence in times of panic and danger will definitely satisfy his plausibility as an authority figure as well as a favorable president. Besides the main actors, Glenn Close ( The Vice president) along with William H. Macy and Wendy Crewson (the first lady) are serviceable to say the very least.

In conclusion, Air Force One will definitely please most fans of far-fetched action packed high explosive films while simultaneously satisfying the technical crowd who thoroughly enjoy seeing their films being treated in a careful and respectful manner.",1265241600,,7441,4.987117552334944

I'll be honest: I didn't expect a whole lot out of this save-the-president film; though I like Harrison Ford well enough, I won't say I'm exactly a fan, and the plot seemed really hackneyed.  Why'd I watch it, then?  I guess I was in the mood for this kind of techno-thriller, in which the President's plane is hijacked by terrorists, and our middle-aged President (Ford) who was formerly a Vietnam combat pilot gets to play hero and almost single-handedly take out the Russian bad guys headed up by nasty psycho Gary Oldman and prevent them from returning evil commie Jurgen Prochnow back to power in Kazakhstan.  Complications include the President's wife and daughter being on board, and disagreements between principal cabinet members (chiefly Glenn Close as the VP and Dean Stockwell as the Secretary of Defense) on how best to handle the situation on the ground; the latter element never builds up to anything convincingly suspenseful.

Like a great many of these kinds of films, AIR FORCE ONE started out pretty well and went downhill both in believability and interest in the second half, but it never fell apart completely despite one really annoying plot hole that apparently the producers, screenwriter Andrew W. Marlowe and/or director Wolfgang Petersen thought we'd be too stupid to think about:  namely that there's a spy on board in the form of a Secret Service agent, we know about him and the people on the ground know about him, but very little if any effort is made to clue the President in about him - and he basically gets ignored by both the terrorists and everyone else until the very end.  And his motives are never mentioned at all - he just turns rogue because, uh, he thought it would be fun, perhaps?  Not good enough, sorry.

Still, this was more lively and intelligent than it could have been; Ford is OK and the rest of the cast is game enough, if not quite enthusiastic except for the always manic Oldman - who is playing basically the same role he's played a dozen times now.  Worth a watch if you like these sorts of things; better than DIE HARD 2 or 4, EXECUTIVE DECISION, or the UNDER SIEGE films, I'd say, to name some movies with comparable plots from the era.  Petersen is never IMO less than a competent director, and he keeps things moving along OK.  The ra-ra patriotic Jerry Goldsmith score got old and pretty overbearing after a half hour.

A time waster, then, but a reasonably enjoyable one.  The standard DVD doesn't have too much in the way of extras, nothing really of substance besides the director's commentary, which I haven't listened to.",1256515200,,2629,4.711790393013101

SPOILER (although, how can you spoil this piece of rotten fruit any more?)

Even so, with its faults, it was exciting entertainment.  Ford did get beat up a bit and as the body count rose and the hostages were getting eliminated, you began to wonder if he would ever prevail.

6646,5,0767803434,"In the Summer of 1997, audiences were treated with another action film from Harrison Ford.  During the 1990's, Ford has made quite a number of successful action films but his performance in ""AIR FORCE ONE"" was truly an example that this Hollywood veteran still had what it takes to be an action star.

The film was directed by well-known action director Wolfgang Petersen (""The Perfect Storm"", ""Troy"", ""Outbreak"", ""Das Boot""), music by well-known composer Jerry Goldsmith (""Rambo"", ""Star Trek: First Contact"", ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"",  ""Basic Instinct"") and Director of Photography by Michael Ballhaus (""Gangs of New York"", ""The Departed"", ""Wild Wild West"").

The film was received positively by critics and a success in the box office as it brought in over $315 million worldwide.  ""AIR FORCE ONE"" even received attention from President Bill Clinton who enjoyed the film and watched it twice.  The film would go on to receive two Academy Award nominations for ""Best Film Editing"" and ""Best Sound"".

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""AIR FORCE ONE"" features a pretty solid transfer on Blu-ray.  Video is presented in 1080p High Definition (aspect ration of 2:40:1) and one thing that I will make clear is that while many films featured in the 90's tend to have a DNR, clean, waxy or soft effect in terms of picture quality, the good news is that ""AIR FORCE ONE"" does not.

In fact, there are scenes where the detail comes out quite nicely.  But if there was one thing that the Blu-ray High Definition transfer does happen to bring out is the amount of grain.  But I would rather take a transfer full of grain than the soft, waxy DNR look any day.  And I am so happy that Sony Pictures Home Entertainment decided to feature ""AIR FORCE ONE"" with a good HD transfer of the film.

As for the audio, I have one word and that is ""magnificent"".

""AIR FORCE ONE"" has one of the most impressive soundtracks that I have heard from a 1990's film.  The soundtrack just sounds absolutely wonderful on English Dolby TrueHD 5.1 (the film is also featured in French Dolby TrueHD 5.1).

The film features a high number of action scenes and gunfire, music, mechanical sounds from the vehicles, jet engines flying, helicopter rotors spinning, it would seem that so much was put into the emphasis of having a wonderful soundtrack that ""AIR FORCE ONE"" truly delivers. And these are not short bursts of audio, there are plenty of scenes that utilize this explosive audio throughout the film.

I was absolutely in awe of how all the speakers were being utilized, especially my surround channels  and I also noticed a few times where my subwoofer would utilize low frequency sounds.  ""AIR FORCE ONE"" is an action thriller that truly delivers with its audio that I can say that this is one of the better sounding action thrillers from the 1990's that just shines on Blu-ray.  And just to think that this film is 12 years old.  I was absolutely thrilled by the audio quality of the film.

As for subtitles, the film is presented in English, English SDH and French.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""AIR FORCE ONE"" features a commentary track by Director Wolfgang Petersen and Michael Coleman.  This is the same commentary from the DVD release but there is good information from Petersen on scenes that were actual aerial shots and not CG and which parts were shot on a set and were CG'd.  Also, learning about his feelings towards his cast members, Harrison Ford especially and how Ford did his own stunt work.

BD Live is also enabled and there are commercials in 1080p for upcoming releases from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I am a big Harrison Ford fan and I watched this film immediately when it came out on theaters.  My first impression was that Harrison Ford should definitely be President because it was like a combination of a President meets DIE HARD's John McClane.  Well, not really but Harrison Ford's role as a President who fights back was definitely a highlight throughout the film.

One thing that I know is when a film is being directed by Wolfgang Petersen, the viewer is definitely going to be treated with an exceptional, action-packed film and ""AIR FORCE ONE"" is just that.  Even 12 years later and this film still holds up quite well.  Petersen and everyone involved in this film did a wonderful job and I have to say that this is my favorite Harrison Ford action thriller to come out in the 1990's.  He manages to have the suave, charisma and that look and feel of an action star but in this case, he's the President of the United States.

But for those who own the DVD of ""AIR FORCE ONE"", you may be wondering if its worth the double dip?  I have to answer with an extreme ""YES!!!"".  The soundtrack of ""AIR FORCE ONE"" is top notch and I will say that its one of the most immersive soundtracks I have heard on Blu-ray.  Also, bare in mind, this is not a new action film, this was a film released in the Summer of 1997 and it can compete with some of the recent, bigger releases on Blu-ray.  That is how magnificent this film sounds on Blu-ray.

If there were faults in the Blu-ray transfer, its the fact that there are not many special features included.  Just the audio commentary but no HD trailer and no making of featurette.  The other thing is that although the film looks better than many 1990's film on Blu-ray and avoids the waxy, DNR look but with its HD transfer, grain is elevated.  Though not too bad, it is noticeable and this may be a slight issue for some viewers but I tend to be on side of grain is part of film and high definition elevates the look of grain.  And personally, I would rather take the grain than a transfer with a lot of DNR or edge enhancement.

Overall, ""AIR FORCE ONE"" is a magnificent action-packed thriller and a film that Harrison Ford truly shines in.  And as for the Blu-ray, this is the definitive version of ""AIR FORCE ONE"" to own!",1243987200,42,5873,4.618129218900675
6647,4,0767803434,"Harrison Ford plays a US President that has traveled to Russia to make a deal with the Russians to fight terrorism, and to seal the fate of a rogue ultranationalist, former Soviet general.  When terrorists supporting that general slip aboard and then take over Airforce One, the president and his family are in danger.

The action is good, and the bravado of Ford as the US president is exciting. I have to admit, however, that the believability of the entire story is pretty sketchy.  There are quite a few holes in the plot, the largest being the lack of an explanation about why a top secret service agent, the one over the President's security detail, would ever help terrorists.

Even so, the drama and action are good.

Those things together make for a good, but not completely outstanding show.

Gary Oldman is a hardliner Russian who has just hijacked the title vehicle, and off we go in the new thriller from director Wolfgang Petersen (In the Line of Fire). Although it obviously has echoes of a Die Hard movie, with ex-Special Forces Prez Ford playing cat and mouse throughout the plane with Oldman's minions, this one stays sharp, smart, and entertaining, thanks to a good script and sure footed direction. Also helping is a fantastic cast, including Glenn Close, Wendy Crewson, William H.

I'm not saying ""AF1"" is 'Oscar material' but I'd rather watch this than something like ""The Last Emperor"".

6677,5,0767803434,"Air Force One  DVD

Air Force One  starring Harrison Ford is one of my favorite movies for all the wrong reasons.

First it shows you what an U. S. President ought to be:
- An Honorably discharged veteran (in the movie he had won the Congressional Medal of Honor)
- Brave ( he chose to stay behind and fight the terrorist who had hijacked the plane)
- A man of action, not just words.
Glenn Close plays a superb Vice-President.  In the movie the President's family on the surface mirrors Bill Clinton's, wife with a teenage , blonde headed daughter.  Too bad reality is so different.

Anyhow as Bill Clinton recently said it's all a fairy tale.

Highly recommended for people who want to know how a President is suppose to be and for fans of Harrison Ford.

6678,4,0767803434,"As action thrillers, go, AIR FORCE ONE has enough of a plot to keep you watching closely as terrorists take over the presidential plane, a sleek beauty of a craft that makes a gleaming set piece for this kind of adventure in the sky. And who is better qualified to take care of things than HARRISON FORD, somewhat less impressive without that hat and familiar stubble as Indiana Jones. (Well, maybe KEVIN COSTNER who was originally slated for the role).

GLENN CLOSE makes a very commanding presence as the Vice President, seemingly never at a loss in moments of distress, and GARY OLDMAN handles his Russian accent and menacing villainy with his usual aplomb. It's just that if you stop long enough to take a breath while all the action is going on, you might see that underneath all the fancy pinnings this is regulation stuff that's been time countless times before--and sometimes with better results.

The cast is impressive with WILLIAM H. MACY and DEAN STOCKWELL on the prez's team and Jerry Goldsmith providing another one of his dependable, if unmemorable, action scores.

And although Wolfgang Petersen does a nifty job of directing, turning the president of the U.S. into an action hero performing stunts that seasoned stuntmen must have been hired for, does stretch credibility a good deal for the climactic moments when airborne peril is at the max for a cliffhanger ending.

Thats right, he's really not much of an actor.  And shamefully the talented Gary Oldman, Glenn Close,  and Jurgen Prochnow are not allowed to show off their skills.

The plot (Air Force One being hijacked by Russian terrorists) seems easy enough.  However, the linchpin of the whole plot is completely ignored, thereby invalidating the whole movie.  For the terrorist plot to succeed, it is completely dependent on one of the secret service agents to be a traitor.  Did he do it for money? power? sex? a good chocolate milkshake?  We'll never know because they don't bother to mention it!  So we're supposed to accept that a president will run around Air Force One beating up terrorists, but a secret service agent who would have to endure YEARS of training, screening, and background checks would turn on the commander-in-chief with no good explanation?  Also do we really want a president who would consider the life of his family over the well-being of the nation?  I know that sounds cruel, but that's THE JOB!

I do not expect reality from movies, in fact when done right fantasy is a great genre.  However, this movie obviously is trying to have SOME basis in reality.  So if you're going to construct a film that has to have some realistic factors, isn't worth time to review the script to make sure it even makes sense?  THIS is primary point of my critique.

I don't feel any possible political leanings are to be drawn from the film.  You're really supposed to shut your brain off, eat popcorn, and feel good about the ole U.S.A..

It will not set your world on fire but you will enjoy it,The picture quality is very good with a nice anamorphic transfer and very few marks on the print, This film may suffer from a slightly unbelievable story line but when you have Harrison Ford, Gary Oldman and Glenn Close delivering performances as strong as these, In this action packed blockbuster, Hollywood legend Harrison Ford stars as President Marshall on board the presidential plane Air Force 1. 1000's of feet in the air President Marshall is horrified when he discovers that the plane has been hijacked by communist radicals. Unless he meets the demands of Korshunov (radicals leader), everyone on board Airforce One will be executed. As well as having to save his own skin the President also faces the daunting prospect of having to rescue his wife and daughter from the jaws of death.

In a film which sees the President's daughter held at gunpoint and his plane chased by Russian fighter jets, Air Force One takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions. This thriller has more twists and turns than the River Nile and is bound to keep you on the edge of your seat right through to the closing credits.

As well as having an excellent plot that keeps both the mind and eye stimualted, the quality of the acting and special effects used make a major contribution to the film. Any movie which features a household name such as Harrison Ford usually guarantees acting of the highest quality and Air Force One is no exception.

6726,5,0767803434,"``Air Force One'' is a thriller that taps into our secretly cherished associations with the presidency. It gives us the president of our dreams, a president of mythic virtues, and then shows him desperately at risk.

The catch is that the audience must believe that it's watching the president of the United States. Buy it, and ``Air Force One,'' now out on video, is halfway home. Don't buy it, and the film becomes a preposterous thriller.

Fortunately, the film finds in Harrison Ford the one actor who can fully inhabit two kinds of grandeur -- action-movie bigness and the aura of the presidency. He has the ego and the intelligence for the job. He has the Gary Hart hair. He also has a quality that Americans perhaps are nostalgic for -- sincerity.

As President James Marshall, Ford is beyond sincere. He is an impassioned visionary. We meet him for the first time at a Kremlin banquet in his honor, giving a speech in which he's about to implode with rage and moral fervor. ``It's your turn to be afraid!'' he warns terrorists. By the time Gary Oldman, as an obsessed Kazak super-nationalist, and his band of Communist mal contents hijack the president's Boeing 747, the act seems like a chilling violation.

There's a violence to ``Air Force One'' that's simply not present in the more cartoonish action films. Bullets rip nasty holes into doors, and the sound of gunshots in the confined space of the presidential plane is a jolt. Oldman's enjoyment in murdering defenseless people makes the violence more personal and frightening. Director Wolfgang Petersen's action fantasy escalates into midair dogfights and elaborate stunts that have people dangling from the Air Force One parachute ramp and later trying to transfer via a cable to a rescue aircraft. There is a tone of confident military heroics and almost a reverence for the presidency that seem a throwback to World War II propaganda movies. ``Air Force One'' might not be the role of Ford's career, but it might be the ultimate role of his maturity.",1146787200,19,2019,4.8604651162790695

With the Superbit DVD you get a slightly better picture image but not anything drastic, at least not that I noticed. It also produces very clear sound, but again, hardly more noticeable than a standard DVD. The downside to this was that the special features were taken off which dissapointed me greatly since I am a fan of commentaries.

6729,3,0767803434,"I really enjoyed this movie when I first saw it, and although I do still like it, my subsequent viewings have found my love of this movie diminishing. Why? It has become too violent for me. I do like action movies like Die Hard, Braveheart, and Under Siege, but for some reason I find some of the violence disturbing and a bit gratuitous and that is not entertaining. Maybe Gary Oldman plays his character too well! There are too many scenes of summary executions and the unfairness of which leave me feeling a bit angry. The best example of that is when the President's Deputy Press Secretary Melanie Mitchel, played by Donna Bullock, is killed in cold blood in front of the Presidents wife and daughter. It is a very disturbing scene and a bit too much.

Despite the violence the movie was a summer popcorn type of film that takes you on an adrenaline filled roller coaster ride of thrills and terror, and in that way it does succeed. Harrison Ford is excellent as the action-hero President. He is a strong yet human character who responds in heroic fashion under extraordinary circumstances. Gary Oldman plays the evil Ivan Korshunov only too well. The one performance that I find annoying is Dean Stockwell's portrayal of Defense Secretary Walter Dean. He doesn't come across as authoritative but rather almost childishly whinny. The movie does also go on a bit too long when the ending rescue is dragged out. Despite its flaws it is still a good action movie made even better by the performance of Harrison Ford.",1141603200,,1517,4.703007518796992

With all members of the Secret Service dead and the terrorists threatening to kill a hostage every half-hour until a prisoner is released from a Russian jail, it is up to Marshall to stop the terrorists. Will he be able to stop the terrorists and save his family?

Okay, in this type of film viewers know from the beginning that the good guys are going to win and the bad guys are going to lose, badly, but not before lots of people die. But, while somewhat predictable, and highly implausible, this is still a good thriller, with plenty of edge of your seat chills. There's just enough twist on the action adventure formula to keep the viewer from guessing what will happen next.

Director Wolfgang Petersen deserves most of the credit for making this film work as well as it does. There are plenty of thrilling action sequences, especially the one that closes out the movie. Harrison Ford is a bit stiff as the President at the beginning of the film, but loosens up and does fine once he gets into action hero mode. Gary Oldman is wonderfully creepy as the main terrorist. Glenn Close and Dean Stockwell do fine as the Vice President and Defense Secretary. William H. Macy is, as always, perfect in a supporting role. Wendy Crewson is also good as the First Lady.

6744,3,0767803434,"But despite that, I have to say I loved this film, and if the ending hadn't kept going on & on, I would have definitely given this movie four stars. It's an amazing film, and I was practically sitting on the edge of my seat, talking (yes, I was) to the TV, saying ""don't do that"" and other such nonsense.

I've never been a big fan of Harrison Ford, but I'm not sure why. Gary Oldman also gives me the creeps! But I find that films on planes are always filled with suspense, and lots of action. It's probably cos it's all filmed in a confined space. Hey I like these kinda films. And I have to say that Gary Oldman did brilliantly speaking in Russian. He probably wasn't speaking what was coming up on the screen in the subtitles ;) but it didn't come across as forced, or unrealistic, like some actors would do an accent.

My problem with this was the ending. It's one of those films, where just as you think it's about to end, something else happens, and by the very end, it was starting to feel a bit dragged out, and just a bit OTT.

I did find the movie quite realistic in a way, as with Harrison Ford playing the president, and not knowing the number to phone through to the White House (someone else must do all this stuff for the presidents.) And it was good stuff having the vice president as a women. Very un-Hollywood. And they also had Glenn Close not bowing under pressure as her character, when she was being pressured to do other things, give in to the Russians etc.

This soundtrack is really good, and the main theme is a really feel good theme. Although I didn't recognise the theme being played to me straight afterwards - I thought that was just too easy! Randy Newman's score was cut late in post-production by director Wolfgang Petersen for being ""too loud and blatty."" Jerry Goldsmith was brought in to do the score in TWO weeks. Can you imagine doing a score in two weeks? He was so daunted by the amount of time he had to write the score that he began requesting that his assignments be given to him months in advance of the finishing of a film's final cut.

I like it when the good guys win. I like it when the bad guys get their @$$'s kicked in a big way. I like it when people do the right things for the right reasons and the results are good. I guess I'm old fashioned that way. That is what this film is like.

Harrison Ford plays the president. He is not just any US president; he is a former war hero and he means what he says. He stands up for what is right. While returning from a state visit to Russia, his plane gets hijacked by terrorists. The secret service manages to get the president to an escape pod and get the pod launched. When it is recovered, the president is not on board. He is still on Air Force One with the bad guys and his family and staff. He's hacked off and goes about taking care of business. For him, that means taking care of his people.

The bad guys are as bad and vicious as they can be. The good guys are scared but, mostly, they are honorable and try to do the right thing. I wish real life was like that.

6748,5,0767803434,"I was completely glued to my seat from beginning to end: this film was nonstop action, suspense and drama. While admittedly *today* in real life there would be intense security to prevent this from happening, it seems a highly plausible plot for a film, especially in 1997 when it was made. The world sat in disbelief when it was announced at a TV  press conference that Kazakhstan terrorists hold the U.S. President James Marshall, delegates, and various family members as hostages up on Air Force One not long after boarding the plane in Russsia. Communications between Glenn Close, the U.S. Vice President, a prisoner on Air Force One and the U.S. Press Secretary in Washington confirmed their status ...

Harrison Ford plays the U.S. President with fearlessness and cunning. He also demonstrates superb hand-to-hand fighting skills plus superior technical expertise with a gun. He becomes the hero who manages to elude the terrorists when he remains one level below, as they overtake the pilot and copilot. He creates diversions and thwarts their various plans, all the while evading detection. Initially, they are unaware whom they are fighting. Once Ivan Korshunov, the leader, realizes it is the President of the United States who nearly single-handedly prevents them from achieving their goals, the terrorist becomes more vicious. He threatens the wife of the President at gun point and turns on the loudspeaker so the President can listen as she voices her fears. This enrages the President who takes even more serious measures to save their lives: he dumps fuel to force them to stop. The fighting scenes are unparalleled yet eventually Harrison Ford is captured. The capture of the President forces the United States to negotiate with the terrorists, despite their policy against doing so. The terrorists want the release of General Alexander Radek, the former ruler of Kazakhstan ...

The rescue of the President, delegates and their families is breath-taking. Fortunately, some manage to jump with parachutes but there are not enough and time is running out ... Air Force One does not have the ability to land. There is a daring awe-inspiring rescue up in the air at 15,000 feet. General Alexander Radek is released from his prison cell, dressed in his well-decorated uniform as he walks across the prison courtyard ... and in the end, justice prevails. Viewing this film sends chills up and down one's spine because despite the many aspects of the film that are exaggerated - terrorism is one area that *thankfully* is *not* depicted in its true scope given what we know of the events of 9-1-1 and current Iraqi War.

6761,4,0767803434,"Waiting for Indiana Jones IV to come to pass, it is always time to reflect on the sad state of Harrison Ford's career, and as we flip through the years it seems to me he hasn't had a bona fide hit since 1997.  (2000's WHAT LIES BENEATH probably made money, but few credit Ford's presence in that thriller for its success; possibly it was a hit due to the well-tuned script and the expert direction by Robert Zemeckis. In any case Michelle Pfeiffer--another star of the 1990s whose career has gone sadly awry--deserves half the credit as well.)  Otherwise it's like a list of one disaster after another.  K-19 THE WIDOWMAKER?  Dead in the water.  HOLLYWOOD HOMICIDE?  Not a bad show but the public stayed away in droves.  RANDOM HEARTS?  When you look up ""catastrophe"" in the dictionary you get a still from this movie.  SIX DAYS SEVEN NIGHTS?  Awful.  WATER TO WINE (2004)?  Even his fans don't know what it is!  I'm not sure FIREWALL will break the curse either, it sounds like a re-tread of an earlier Ford flop called FRANTIC.

So when we look back and try to find the last good patch of Harrison Ford's once invincible streak, we come up with a thump against this indisputable box office sensation, which rules the theaters world wide for a brief spell in 97.  The critics thought it piffle, but it answered a need in the US public, maybe to see a strong president defying the Russians one last time.  Reactionary?  No two moviegoers will read its plot the same way, but there are certainly cimilarities to the FOX TV hit ""24,"" which it foreshadowed in so many ways, even down to the canny use of amiably sinister Xander Berkeley, the husband in SAFE.  And of course the death defying traumas that occur to Air Force One in both programs.

Most of all, I think people long for a president who's more like James Marshall here, than the one we had in 1997 or the one we have now.  He's a father figure, he's still vigorous and sexy, he's got a good sense of humor, knows his way around a gun AND he protects us from the threat of Glenn Close.

AIR FORCE ONE itself was a sort of comeback project for the beleaguered Ford, whose previous films had been major disappointments--the terrible SABRINA remake and the muddled IRA thriller DEVIL'S OWN with Brad Pitt.  I think at that minute we really needed Harrison Ford to start thinking about how to sustain a career.  Instead he just must have said Ah Screw It and switched the remote to a then-new TV show called ALLY McBEAL.  The rest is film history.",1118620800,6,2502,4.484513274336283

Doesn't that bother anyone? This movie screams Hollywood and follows it so faithfully its scary. In real life, for that is what we are trying to portray, would the president jump out of a falling plane, try to save his rogue commander or any of the other numerous things that never stop happening? Maybe...maybe not. Obviously on Air Force One he's a superman, because he is able to do all these things.

Air Force One needs to come down out of the clouds and have some reality shot into it. Other than that, this movie is a rather decent action thriller. Just for action mind you. That, and fans of Harrison Ford should apreciate his superhuman role.

6764,4,0767803434,"One of Harrison Ford's better and least appreciated performances, Air Force One is a thrilling film that makes the most of its action hero star and his unique bond with movie going audiences. In Air Force One, Ford plays the role of President of the United States. In the same way that it's near impossible to envision any other actor in the role of Indiana Jones, it's difficult to envision anyone else as president for this film. Ford projects the image of such a strong, honorable, and likeable leader that the audience is immediately rooting for him.

Originally released in 1997, Ford plays President James Marshall, a Vietnam vet turned president who makes it clear in a stunning speech at a Moscow dinner that America will now pursue a ""zero tolerance"" policy on international terrorism (sound familiar?). Boarding Air Force One for the return flight home from Moscow, Marshall is joined by his wife Grace (Wendy Crewson) and his daughter Alice (Liesel Matthews). He's also joined by a contingent of Eastern European journalists led by Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman).

Unbeknownst to the President and his fellow Air Force One passengers, the group of men aren't journalists at all, but instead an elite team of terrorists bent on taking the president hostage. With a Secret Service agent (Xander Berkeley) collaborating with the terrorists, Korshunov has intimate inside knowledge of the procedures and safeguards deployed to protect the president on Air Force One. When Secret Agent Gibbs (Berkeley) opens the onboard weapons cache of Air Force One, his terrorist friends carry out a methodic plan to eliminate the president's security circle.

At the sound of gunfire, President Marshall is hurriedly raced below deck to an escape pod so as to avoid his capture. With the pod jettisoned, Korshunov is enraged that the original plan failed. But his original goal remains intact, and the terrorist decides that the president's family and the remaining passengers will make do as hostages. Negotiating with the acting Vice President (Glenn Close) in the President's absence, Korshunov demands the release of General Ivan Radek (Jurgen Prochnow), a communist hardliner who Korshunov believes will bring back the Soviet Union and restore the intoxicating glory of its empire years. With a well laid and executed plan, Korshunov's demands are met and arrangements are made to release General Radek. But what Korshunov doesn't know is that President Marshall is still onboard, having jettisoned an empty escape pod, and he's intent on freeing his family and kicking the terrorists off his plane...

Filled with action and some memorable one-liners, Air Force One is a classic Harrison Ford action thriller along the lines of Patriot Games and Clear And Present Danger. In addition, prior to filming Air Force One, the producers were given unprecedented access to the real thing. The result is a film that displays the inner sanctums of Air Force One with stunning accuracy, providing the audience with a glimpse into the actual traveling life of the most powerful man in the world. Overall, this a must-see movie that you won't want to miss...

6765,5,0767803434,"President Jim Marshall (Ford) has just taken a powerful stand against genocide in Russia.  US Special Ops along with Russian units have captured General Raddick, who is responsible for a reign of terror and hundreds of thousands of deaths. In his speech, Marshall admits the USA had waited too long and that they won't do this again---because it is the 'right thing to do.'

The Prez isn't exactly returning to the USA in triumph, though.  His National Security Advisor doesn't agree with him and the 'doves' among the Administration are thinking this is an open call of war.

Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman) and a team of Russian bad guys manage to sneak onboard Air Force One and take over the plane.  They believe the Prez took the escape pod and left his staff, wife, and daughter to die.  What they don't know is that Marshall (a Medal of Honor winnter) is still onboard and is working to take back his plane.

Action is almost nonstop in this 1997 Wolfgang Peterson film and if you can believe Air Force One can withstand the beating its taken, you can also believe the US could have a hero as a President.

6766,5,0767803434,"Andrew W. Marlowe, the writer of Air Force One, did an excellent job of producing a wildly entertaining story of a United States president (Harrison Ford), who basically becomes a counter-terrorism agent when his plane is high jacked in the wild blue yonder.

While the taking of Air Force One has to be far more difficult than portrayed on screen, don't worry about it. Sit back and enjoyed the ride and what a ride it is!

Gary Oldman, master of a thousand accents, convincingly plays a ruthlessly brutal Russian Terrorist who wants one of his comrades released from prison. Only the president can call in favors to get this done.

The conflict: The United States doesn't negotiate with terrorists under any circumstances. Well, maybe the US will negotiate if the president and his family have been kidnapped and used as the only viable bargaining chips.

I don't know what kind of shielding the real Air Force One has, but, I for one was glad that there was serious gun play on the 747 without losing cabin pressure and crashing it. Without this feature, the film would have been much less exciting.

This is a dumb, but very fun, action picture with a preposterous premise. The script ain't great. The acting, however, is really top-notch, in the fact that you buy into all of it. I couldn't imagine the film working at all with out Ford and Oldman.

It's not supposed to be any sort of comment on the current state of world affairs, how could it be? It was made YEARS before the WTC attack. You have to look at it as a personal story. It takes the inherant drama of a man with power being placed in a position where it means nothing, the ratcheting it up by placing what he holds most dear in jeopardy.

It has all of the essential elements of a great action movie; great script, good directing, above-average acting, a reasonable amount of special effects, plenty of twists, and lots of action.  ""Air Force One"" takes but a few minutes to set the stage, introduce the main characters, and let the events begin to come together.

Harrison Ford is the president, with a solid military past, whose plane is taken over by Russian reactionary militants.  The concept that the events of this struggle would primarily take place on a jumbo jet adds to the excitement; there's no running away (although it may, at times, seem that there is).  I won't go over the plot because, if you haven't seen ""Air Force One"" yet, you won't want to know what's next.

I noticed that some previous reviews had a few objections about various technical and political aspects of the movie.  Yes, there are plenty of bullets flying around while everyone is flying around.  However, I dismissed that as an aspect of the latest in aviation technology as would exist on Air Force One.  Ironically, the idea of terrorists hijacking Air Force One is more believable today than when the movie came out.  My pet peeve with the movie has to do with the failure to properly explain how an inside member of the President's circle could be the one to aid and abet this takeover.  In the several times I've seen the movie, this matter has never satisfactorily been explained.

Ford won't give up without a fight and he's determined to save his family and friends without Oldmans plans being met.

The movie is so fake it's sad. The plane would have been destroyed by pressure. It gets laced with 100's of rounds of ammo. Come on you have to make is somewhat believable. Wolfgang Peterson should be slapped upside the head for putting something like that in a movie.

Glen Close is horrible. Her dramatics are over the top. The fact that her character negotiates for the president is stupid. We don't negotiate with terrorists and the fact that they put that in his dumb. It's so fake.

Russia would never give up dangerous men either. They'd tell us they felt bad for the president being in danger and would tell us to shove are demands where the sun don't shine.

This movie is way to fake. I couldn't enjoy it because it would never happen. I enjoy action dramas and this is one of the worst ones I've ever seen. If they had decided to make this more a drama and not so much action I might have been able to go along with it. The cast is awesome for the movie and a drama could have worked. The cast and talents are wasted. Why this made so much money I don't know. I guess people are stupid enough to follow the story.

But that all changes when he announces that the United States will no longer negotiate with terrorists at a convention in Moscow. But that all changes on the flight back to Washington. A group of Russian terrorists led by Gary Oldman hijack Air Force One.

On his way home from Russia, after his remarkable pronouncement, Air Force One is hijacked by terrorists led by Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman).  They are determined to win the freedom of General Ivan Radek (Jurgen Prochnow), a military leader who murdered thousands of people in his bid for power.  The secret service agents on the plane sacrificed themselves to get the President into the escape pod in the belly of the plane, leaving the President's closest advisors, as well as his wife and daughter, at the mercy of the terrorists...
Vice President Kathryn Bennett (Glenn Close) immediately tries to negotiate with the terrorists to get the hostages off the plane alive while the military follows the beacon to the president's escape pod.  Everything changes when the escape pod is found - empty.  President James Marshall never left the plane and he is determined to make the terrorists pay.  However, the terrorists quickly notice that their numbers are dwindling and assume that there is a secret service agent loose on the plane.  They begin killing hostages in the hopes that they will find one that matters enough to the unknown man for him to give himself up.  With the clock ticking and increasing numbers of hostages being murdered, President Marshall soon finds that he is forced into negotiating with the terrorists and arranging for the release of General Radek from prison.  But that doesn't mean that he is beaten as he uses every trick in the book to get the terrorists off his plane...
Air Force One is a great movie.  It is fast paced, full of action and you almost instantly identify with the characters, especially Harrison Ford, as we have seen him play the president so many times that it is instantly believable.  It is true that many of the details of the movie are obviously fantasy, such as the mythical escape pod (that doesn't exist on the real Air Force One), the ease with which the terrorists boarded the plane, and the constant firing of weapons on the plane without ever puncturing anything important, but the director is so talented and the cast so believable that you don't really think of any of this until after the movie is over.

6812,5,0767803434,"Air Force One, the 1997 summer hit directed by Wolfgang Petersen (The Boat/Das Boot, In The Line of Fire) and starring Harrison Ford as President James Marshall, stretches the term ""willing suspension of disbelief"" to its limits, yet, incredibly, it works.
Co-starring Gary Oldman, Glenn Close, Wendy Crewson, Liesel Matthews, William H. Macy, and Dean Stockwell, Air Force One's premise is simple: Russian ultra-Communist terrorists take over the President's plane on its way back to the U.S. from Moscow.  Marshall, who by happenstance is separated from his family and staff during the takeover, must use his military training (he's a former Air Force pilot) and his wits to regain control of Air Force One and rescue the hostages before the terrorists achieve their aims.
The terrorists, led by Ivan Korshunov (Oldman), are seeking the immediate release of General Alexander Radek (Jurgen Prochnow), who was snatched from his palace in Kazakhstan by a joint team of Russian and American Special Forces.  Radek and his followers believe in the restoration of the old Soviet Union, and until both Russia and the U.S. intervened, had ruled Kazakhstan with as much regard for human life as the Taliban exhibited when they ruled Afghanistan.  After a ceremony hosted by the grateful Russian President in which Marshall warns rogue nations and terrorists that ""we will no longer be afraid. It's your turn to be afraid,"" the American delegation heads to one of Moscow's main airports to board the Presidential plane.
Little do they know that Korshunov and his team, using falsified press credentials, have passed through both Russian and American security and are aboard.  Ironically, they are given a tour of Air Force One by the unsuspecting assistant press secretary, Melanie Mitchell  (Donna Bullock). And why not? To the Secret Service agents and the Air Force Security detachment, Korshunov and his people are reporters, harmless and unarmed. So how in the world are these guys going to storm Air Force One, ""the most secure aircraft in the world?""  Hmmm....and why do Korshunov and Secret Service agent Gibbs (Xander Berkeley) exchange that glance as they pass each other, eh?
Petersen and screenwriter Andrew W. Marlowe never do explain Gibbs' motivations for his subsequent actions (as the director admits in the audio commentary track), but by the time audiences start asking those ""real life"" questions about plausibility, the sheer adrenaline rush provided by this action-packed film suppresses the ""yeah, right"" response to its premise.  The Air Force (which willingly participated in the production of this film) says there is no escape pod in Air Force One's list of defensive measures, and viewers know that no sane person, whether terrorist or not, is going to fire automatic weapons inside an airborne plane unless he or she knew the mission was going to fail anyway.
Mixed in with the gunfire and explosions that punctuate the film, Petersen and Marlowe endow their characters with depth and believability.  Petersen makes viewers care about each person being held hostage, warts and all, so that when one is lost,  it feels real.  Even Korshunov is played in such way that his motivations feel true and heartfelt, even if his cause is not just.
Yet Petersen and his cast and crew make audiences forget these dull real life facts.  By the time the credits roll to Jerry Goldsmith's rousing End Title Suite, the viewer will wish the current occupant of the Oval Office were replaced by Harrison Ford's President Marshall, who is not only a man of political integrity but also a man of action.",1061942400,37,3606,5.094915254237288
6813,5,0767803434,"Harrison Ford as President--that aspect alone would be enough to drive many to see Air Force One.  Yet this thriller does not disappoint even the most discerning critics of action film and indeed stands out as one--if not THE--best action film made since the 80's.
The premise: ex-Soviet dissidents hijack Air Force One in revenge for the President's crackdown on terrorism and terrorist regimes.  Gary Oldman plays an excellent terrorist, and Harrison Ford's President is the kind of hands-on hero that would prompt a repeal of the 22nd Amendment (for those unsavvy of the Constitution, that's the one that limits Presidents to two terms).
The action ride simply does not quit as it begins with the hijackers' takeover of Air Force One (with the help of a traitorous Secret Serviceman) and the President's apparent escape to Ford's battle to retake the plane and rescue his staff to a near-landing at Ramstein AFB in Germany to the in-air refueling to MiGs firing upon Air Force One to the final confrontation... nor like some films is the pacing flawed so that the watcher is drained or left wanting after the first few scenes; Air Force One simply keeps viewers on the edges of their seats for the entire film.

6814,1,0767803434,"I rewatched this movie just last night (April 13th, 2003), to see what messages it actually uses to play on people's fears and misconceptions about the world around America. At times embarassing, at times eerily in tune with current events, and at all times constantly questioning one's own common sense. Hollywood is always seeking to entertain and distract its audience, but putting such political issues in focus without any thought or plausibility insults those with any mind to question.
Let's just say this is a theatre piece, and dramatic elements have to be employed to add to the plot or sequence of events. That this, and so many movies of its kind employ the use of Russians as the enemy (usually using a British actor to supply the villainy) perpetuates stereotypes and misinformation that has existed since the Cold War's birth. I loved the fact that America was seen as a bastion of technology, with blinking lights and computer screens, and intercoms, technology at the helm, while Russia and its leader had a little red phone and a bear on his table. Fantastic. It automatically sets up a perception that Russia is weaker on all fronts, and the victor will always be America, so the whole premise of the film being America in danger is compromised by its visualisation of its power as compared to Eastern Europe. It throws the whole plot out the window by default.
Apart from its Nationalistic stance, the dialogue of the film borders on the ludicrous to outright childlike. The only bite that is heard in this film is from the actual enemy (portrayed by Gary Oldman) when questioning the President's (Harrison Ford) moral constitute when dealing with his Oldman's homeland. The points raised were the only plausible or believeable lines in this movie, but it all too quickly falls into the 'remake Rambo' style of filmmaking too many times. This is just entertainment for the masses, and does not ask any questions of moral fortitude or revenge, or anything actually relevant to anything in any real world situation. Should I take this movie just as it is, entertainment, or for what it represents, 'Horse Blinker' propaganda aimed at the public.
I cannot guess why films like this get made???? All that money wasted on a piece of junk. The CGI throughout is quite weak, especially the 'crash' at the end which pays no heed to what a plane would actually do when hitting the water, which WOULD have been far more dramatic a conclusion, if they just paid attention to physics. It was actually hilarious.
I think the scariest bit had to be the speech at the beginning of the film by Harrison Ford. I've heard it before somewhere....
Don't waste your time, money, patience, eyesight, hearing or mind on this huge waste of finances. I can't believe some of the actors actually did.",1050364800,10,2794,4.822916666666667

Name me another actor who could play anyone from Lee Harvey Oswald (JFK) to Beethovan (Immortal Beloved)?!?
So here I'm going to concentrate my review on the Columbia Tristar super-hyped ""Superbit"" series and I can sum up my evaluation in three little words - DON'T BE FOOLED!  While it's true that packing on excessive extra features and a feature film onto one side of a DVD ""can"" result in a loss of digital quality in the transfer, this is not really an issue when the movie itself runs just under the two hour mark and the extra features amount to a fifteen minute ""making of"" featurette and some theatrical trailers.
THIS TRANSFER IS VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL TO THE PREVIOUSLY ISSUED DVD.
Having stated this, the fidelity of this transfer is outstanding.  Colors are well balanced and bold.  Edge enhancement, pixelization and shimmering are non-existant. Fine details are extremely sharp.  The audio is earth-shattering.  Overall a great, great job from Columbia Tristar.  One problem: they already did just as much on the original DVD release.  Hence, this time around is really just a waste of disc space.

6816,4,0767803434,"Okay, so it might be a stretch of the imagination that the presidential jet can sustain hundreds of rounds of machine gun fire. That aside, ""Air Force One"" poses the (then) unlikely premise of a terrorist group commandeering the First Plane (maybe not so unlikely now) and how Harrison Ford, as a strict anti-terrorist commander-in-chief, has to abort the plot while saving not only himself but the First Family. Ford, one of the acting business' most professional artists, is absolutely believeable as both the most powerful man in the Free World and a family man, often struggling not to let the lines of both intersect. The multi-talented Gary Oldman (Francis Ford Coppola's ""Dracula,"" ""The Contender"") is in his element as the thoroughly and dastardly evil leader of the terrorist group, and the incomparable Glenn Close is riveting as the loyal Vice President who refuses to grab the reigns of power as long as her president stays alive. But Close's bigger contribution is her unparalled ability to convey her character's sense of subdued panic while maintaining calm as an uncertain nation looks on. Director Wolfgang Petersen (""Das Boot"") has come up with a terrific nail-biter despite a couple of stretches of imagination.

Audiences walked out with pride in their hearts (fueled by Jerry Goldsmith's rousing score) and they forgot about the LewinskyGate scandal that was going down with the REAL President at the time.

But the film is very good in it's own right too. Wolfgang Peterson creates a heavy feeling of tension, Ford a likeable hero and Oldman as Korshunov, a rotten villain who was actually quite scary. The film is also very well put together technically. The editing and sound is top-notch, though some of the CGI is way below par for your average blockbuster. The R-rating helps. If this were made today it would be PG-13 garbage, but the blood spatters, swearing and body count make you believe that ANY character could die next.

But there are flaws. And one BIG flaw. Some of the dialogue really sucks. And Wendy Crewson has a pretty bad role as the First Lady. The only reason her character is even in it is because the President needs to have a First Lady. Her role is totally useless. I predicted her EVERY line of dialogue before she even said it. I am not kidding. Even Oldman at one point tells her to `SHUT UP!' echoing the feeling of every viewer.

If you can overlook this minor, although highly irritating, glitch you will totally enjoy a high-octane action film with many, increasingly exciting, set-pieces. Very cool.

The President of the USA goes to Moscow and gives a stirring speech outlining the USA's new ""Zero-tolerance"" policy with respect to terrorism.  On the flight home, terrorists take over Air Force One (the President's official indestructible plane) and take the passengers including his wife and daughter hostage. The terrorists plan to execute one hostage every half-hour unless/until their demands are met. However, the President is a former Medal of Honor winner, so the terrorists are in for a surprise.  He manages to deploy the escape pod empty.  After searching through luggage to locate his cell phone, he calls the White House.  The operator does not believe the president is calling so he convinces her to trace the call.  This is a hilarious scene.  While receiving instruction as to how to connect wires to release fuel, the battery on the cellular phone goes dead.  The terrorists kill people with the speaker on so that the other hostages can hear.  It is very nerve wrecking and keeps you on the end of your seat.  After managing to get in the room where his staff is, he discovers the terrorist have his wife and daughter with them.  He has an idea but in order for the hostages to be able to parachute off he must communicate to the White House to lower the altitude to 15,000 when refueling.  One of his staff suggests sending a fax since fax lines are separate from the phone lines and could easily be overlooked.  Not sure as to whether or not the message was communicated, the hostages prepare to parachute off of the plane.  Once the terrorists realize what is happened, they capture the president and put a gun to his daughter's head.  Suspense fills the air; you can hardly stand to watch.  He starts counting, 1...2, and the president can't stand it anymore.  He gives in to the terrorist and calls to request the release of the General.  The terrorist admits he lied and does not plan to release the president nor his family.  You see the look on Harrison Ford's face, and know he is not only mad but not going to put up with this.  While being tortured and beaten, the president manages to pick up a piece of glass to use to free himself.  He recovers Air Force One just in time to stop the release of the General.  Not only does he not have a pilot to fly the plane but also due to the damage to the engines Air Force One is not able to land.  The rescue mission begins with a cable connecting from one plane to the other.  His family is safe but there is only time for one more person. The question is will the president escape or will the American on Russia's side interfere?  This is a must see movie.",1033430400,,2849,4.53921568627451
6840,5,0767803434,"From beginning to end, Air Force One is a relentlessly gripping thrill ride, cumulating suspense with one superbly taut sequence after another. You can chalk this one up as another success for superstar Harrison Ford and director Wolfgang Peterson, who's consistently been one of the better action filmmakers around.
Ford stars as James Marshall, the president of the United States. He and his cabinet have just recently made the crucial decision to go after a renegade general named Radek, who threatens to bring back a state of communism to Russia. The mission to capture him is a success, but not long after Marshall and his family board Air Force One on a flight back to the U.S., Russian terrorists posing as newsreporters take over the flight, complete with machine guns and heavy weaponry. Their demands: to have Radek released or else a hostage (50 total) will be executed every half-hour. You can guess where things go from there, as Marshall remains hidden in the cargo area, ready to take back the plane and save his family.
Despite an occasionally ridiculous story and quite a few implausibilities, Air Force One never fails to work as a nail-biting actioner. The suspense is palpable, thanks to likeable characters and hissable villains.  There's also the sense of iminent danger and gutsy unpredictability that director Peterson infuses the film with. Hostages are killed every half-hour, and perhaps even those you expect to live through the situation are killed off pretty quickly; the terrorists are not the slightest bit unflinching or unwavering, making for effective villains.
I've heard a lot of complaints about the seemingly never-ending conclusion, but for me, it just made the film that much more an unpredictable roller coaster ride, with one edge-of-the-seat situation after another. The action sequences are the ""requisite"" shootouts and fistfights, but are truly exciting, and the fact that this is all set on board the world's most famous aircraft adds frantic urgency to the proceedings. There are also a lot of fantastic stunts, the most thrilling one featuring Ford dangling in mid-air, being reeled inside an aircraft with a cable and strap.
Harrison Ford has one of the most commanding presences of any Hollywood actor, and Air Force One is almost entirely his show. Yeah, James Marshall may be too damn perfect for a politician, but this is a red-blooded action flick, and I want a hero that I can unabashedly cheer for from beginning to end, and Marshall is just that kind of guy. Gary Oldman's the villian, and in true Oldman style, you can expect lots of hollering in a somewhat unintelligible accent (which honestly doesn't sound particularly Russian, as it's meant to).
Jerry Goldsmith's score is excellent, giving the film an additional intensity, and even revving up excitement during the quieter moments. The main theme is a bit overly patriotic, but undeniably rousing.  Hard to say, but this is probably the famed composer's best score since Rudy.
Aside from the logical flaws in the story, the only time the film really stumbles is in the visual effects category. Don't get me wrong, most of the CGI is superb, but there's at least one scene near the end that features probably the most hilariously unconvincing (and disappointing) CGI-rendered shot I've ever seen in a big-studio production.
Air Force One may be a little silly and implausible, but it's irony-absent presentation is refreshing in a time when just about every other film out there is trying to be as annoyingly sarcastic as possible. In this era of Die-Hard rip-offs, Air Force One is easily one of the best, and for my money, it's more entertaining than the original Die Hard itself.

6843,4,0767803434,"Despite a plot that strains credibility at times, AIR FORCE ONE is still a superior action film thanks to the always-reliable Harrison Ford and the steady hand of German director Wolfgang Petersen (DAS BOOT; IN THE LINE OF FIRE).
Ford portrays President James Marshall, who has just given a speech decrying international terrorism and warning those that would use terrorism for political purpose, ""Your day is over.""  But when a truly despicable Russian national (Gary Oldman) and his men forcibly take over the President's plane, holding not only his staff, but even more importantly his wife and daughter, as hostages, Ford is forced to take matters into his own hands.  The result is not always plausible, and some of the special effects don't work quite as well as they should, but one cannot fault the film's pace or the tension and excitement inherent in the story.
Ever since playing Han Solo in STAR WARS and Indiana Jones in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, Ford has developed into a leading man of the action genre--the thinking man's action hero.  That aspect blossomed in PATRIOT GAMES, CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER, and, especially THE FUGITIVE; and here in AIR FORCE ONE he gets to play the most important man in the world.  He does it with considerable style.  Glenn Close was also a cagey choice to play the first female vice-president, and she does this with incredible fortitude.  William H. Macy and Dean Stockwell are equally fine in supporting roles as part of the President's staff.  And Oldman, whose performance as Oswald in Oliver Stone's JFK was a miracle performance, is equally superlative as the villain, matching the Bruce Willis/Alan Rickman pairing in DIE HARD.
Petersen's direction, despite some missteps, never allowed the film to sag; and Jerry Goldsmith's music score is appropriately patriotic without being sickeningly so, and always suspense-building.

6848,4,0767803434,"Air Force One is one of my favourite action films, as it is for many people, and it's easy to see why. Wolfgang Petersen's action thriller starring Harrison Ford as the president of America is a taut, exciting action flick (And sure to never be in-flight entertainment).
Gary Oldman is the movie's main villain, a terrorist with some scores to settle. Both he and Ford are great, and with the added start power of William H.Macy and Glenn Close make this big-name action-fest great fun.
Performances, action scenes, special effects and music (Jerry Goldsmith) are all top-notch, as well as some great patriotic stuff from Harrison. The only thing I don't like is some scenes are predictable and jingoism takes over sometimes. Regardless, it's great fun, and an equally great DVD. Cool stuff.",1019088000,,791,4.954887218045113

The stunts in this movie are great, including a scene with a refueling tanker, and a scene where the president must ride a tether to get out of the plane.",1019001600,,448,4.779220779220779
6860,5,0767803434,"I'd like to start off by saying that I haven't watched Air Force One in several years, so I've forgotten whata great film this actually is.  I have had the VHS Widescreen version since 1998, but I've only watched it once since then.  But fast forward to 2002 and now its on Superbit DVD.  All I have to say is WOW!  The picture and sound will blow you away.  The sound especially if you have a 5.1 surround system.  The gun fire is especially intense and well spaced in the the sound field.  One of the most jaw-dropping scenes is the F-15/MiG-29 engagement at the end.  Another is when Air Force One crashes into the Ocean.  WOW!  What a crash scene!
But another thing I'd like to point out is that it's strange now that all these films that have to do with terrorists have an all new meaning and message now in our post-9/11 world.  If you'll recall, Oldman's character was a Russian nationalist who wanted a re-united Russian motherland with the President (played by Jurgen Prochnow, of Das Boot fame) of Kazakstan as the Russian Prime Minister.  Except that he's a renegade that wants to use the old Russian nuclear stockpile to terrorize the free world.  Oldman states how US foreign policy may be beneficial to the US, but it destroys the lives of other countries.  I think he mentions something about the sanctions on Iraq causing undue suffering.  So you see, these old terrorist movies should have been a bit of a wake-up call for us.
So in closing, if you're looking for a good terrorist thriller in this post-9/11 world, look no further than Air Force One on Superbit.",1018656000,,1579,4.530035335689046
6861,3,0767803434,"If you can switch off the demand for realism from a film for a couple of hours then this is for you. Harrison Ford and Glenn Close start in this Box Office blockbuster about Soviet revolutionaries who hijack the US Presidential place (Air Force One) and the heroic one-man battle against them in the guise of the US President who remains aboard the plane. Gary Oldman plays Egor Korshunov, a trigger-happy terrorist who fires at will and is prepared to sacrifice his life for ""Mother Russia"" whilst Glenn Close's negotiating skills bring for an interesting aside to the main plot. As I mentioned, it is essential that the flying scenes (look for the one at the start involving their return to the air) and rescue scenes are not taken as rigorous to the truth as, in many respects, they are as flimsy as the security systems aboard Air Force One.
In general this is not a bad film (after all, the Box Office ratings were good) and as far as typical blockbusters go, I could probably watch it again.

This is a very good fil, well-paced and well acted. The commentary by Wolfgand Peterson reveals many interesting facts about the film including the professionalism of Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman.
My only complaint is about two sequences involving Air Force One - this is a personal thing. I hate action or stunt scenes which stretch credibility. The first scene, when Air Force One has just landed but the hijackers take off again is a little bit unbelievable. The second scene, at the end, is not only ridiculous and laughable, it is a very poor effect - looking as if the budget has just run out.

6890,1,0767803434,"This silly farce may have worked if it had been promoted as satire.  No matter. There was NO excuse for this doozy.
Glenn Close as vice president is trying to maintain order after learning Soviet terrorists have hijacked the president's plane with his staff, wife and daughter aboard.  Close's high octane drama was silly.  If you didn't like Hillary, youll hate Glenn.
On Air Force One after the hijacker takeover, President Harrison Ford issued some pretty sappy dialogue with his cookie cutter pretty little wife and daughter.  The little girl's dippy words were an embarrassment.  She sounded like a Pollyana Retard telling ""daddy"" not to worry, all would be all right. Fords insipid marshmallow smile (""Oh, out of the mouths of babes"")in return underscored the absurdity of the scene.  I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.
In ""Star Wars"", a Sci-Fi fantasy, using gangbuster-type special effects with macho fighter planes piloted by arrogant hot shot captains was acceptable....including exploitation of the audience's jingoistic allegiance to the overdone heros. In ""Air Force One"" the same approach was insulting.
The finale too was insulting....and a joke. This skinny little man, President Harrison Ford, has somehow managed to save everyone else off his doomed airborne presidential plane (I'll let you rent the movie and learn how). Alone now, he has managed to attach himself to a cable between the doomed Air Force One and the attendant savior plane to save himself. This he does but it is not fun watching him blow in the wind in his little gray presidential suit, what..? 15,000 feet up, at 300/500 miles per hour?  I don't know the coordinates.  Ive never had to consider that kind of thing before I saw this movie.
Who wrote the script?  Where was the director when the lines were delivered? Where have you gone, Harrison Ford - a seasoned, respected and sober actor, I assumed - that you could sell out for this shallow silliness and then pretend you are a genuine actor?
A couple big names, an idiotic script/story line and overdone phony special effects with chauvinistic fighter planes exploding to the rescue to STP (Save the President) do not an intelligent movie make.
Watch Air Force One if you want to, but pretend it was meant to be satire only. In other words, avoid at least some of the insult.",1009843200,6,2324,4.908163265306122

Even so, in the small screen time they get, Glenn Close is convincing as the tight-jawed Vice President and Wendy Crewson scores points as a dignified First Lady, compassionate mother and loving wife.  Harrison Ford, appealingly macho as ever, occasionally distances himself from his character with a lapse into tongue-in-cheek line-readings or facial expression.  Otherwise, he is properly presidential.  As the first daughter, Liesel Matthews displays a range of emotion that many of the more seasoned supporting actors lack.

A lot of folks complained about the supposed unrealistic nature of this film, but I think we know now that it isn't as unrealistic as we would have hoped. As far as this movie goes, it is a thrill ride that is sort of like Die Hard on Air Force One, with the president playing the John McClane character in place of Mr. Willis. The terrorists are complex in their rationale, but ultimately, like all terrorists, they are evil at heart. Frankly, it's a bit unnerving to watch it all happening on the screen. But unrealistic is not the word to use any more. Sure, parts of it strain credulity, but so does virtually every action adventure film (automatic weapons fire never seems to actually hit the good guys in Rambo, or Mr. Schwarzenneger, or Mr. Willis, for example).
In fact, I was sold on this movie mainly by the performance of Ford, who does an absolutely Oscar-caliber portrayal of the kind of president we all imagine in our dreams. He brings a believability and an integrity to every character he plays, whether it be as president, Han Solo or Indiana Jones.

Score: 69/100
Wolfgang Petersen, that is a great name isn't it? He made The Boat, In the Line of Fire and numerous other classics. Well, is Air Force One really as good as his older movies? No, the answer is no. But it's not as far off as you may have heard. Air Force One is awesome entertainment, and although it has its share of flaws in the script, you probably won't even notice because you'll be too enthralled with the high-flying adventure.
The President of the USA (Harrison Ford) goes to Moscow and gives a stirring speech outlining the USA's new ""Zero-tolerance"" policy with respect to terrorism. On the flight home, terrorists actually take over Air Force One (the President's official plane) and take the passengers (including his wife and daughter) hostage. The terrorists plan to execute one hostage every half-hour unless/until their demands are met. However, the President is a former Medal of Honour winner, so the terrorists may be in for a surprise...
We are certainly in for tonnes of surprises. The action is blasting and will grab you when you least expect it and the visual effects are a treat to the eye. The story is weak, but the action delivers plenty of goods and it the films makes darn sure that you and your head won't be turning away from the screen to go to sleep. Harrison Ford is good, but, surprisingly, it's Glenn Close who plays Vice President Kathryn Bennett that really steals the show. Sure, Harrison takes all the action, but Glenn is more powerful.

The sound was nothing to marvel at (the gunshots, however, did sound really defined on my 5.1 surround sound system).  But I didn't buy the movie for Ford, the sound, or even the amazing clarity of its visuals.  I really bought Air Force One because of its supporting cast and its ""in your face"" directorial style (Wolfgang Petersen's trademark).  From William H. Macy to Gary Oldman to Glen Close to many others, this movie really shines in its supporting cast (the plane included, who gives a stunning performance, without even a stunt double).  However, an outstanding supporting cast does usually mean that the lead role (or roles) isn't doing his or her job.  I think that's the only area where this movie fails to be convincing.
Don't think I'm against Harrison Ford or anything.  I believe these kinds of movies make the public feel very patriotic.  And I believe that if Harrison Ford ran for president, he would probably be victorious.",986169600,3,1079,4.7272727272727275

There was much truth to what Gary Oldman's character says to the President about american involvement abroad.  And as such, for one of the first times, an american film is not so pro american.  Bravo!
Now to detract.  If our secret service is as inept as they were portrayed in this film I feel sorry for the President.  And I have to say that at times certain scenes came off incredibly staged and unrealistic.  And some scenes just seemed very inplausible.

6934,4,0767803434,"Air Force One is about a president, played by the tough Harrison Ford, who after authorizing the kidnapping of a former Russian republic president for acts of terrorism, faces his own troubles. Air Force One, the most sophisticated aircraft in the sky, is hijacked by a group of Russian terrorists trying to get their leader free from jail. But they did not count on the president fighting back!
With his wife and daughter on the plane, Ford must race against time to save them. Glenn Close, as the Vice President on the ground, becomes acting president after Ford is presumed dead. She tries to talk down the terrorists, the leader played by Gary Oldman, in his most terrifying role ever. But with no success, it is up to Ford to take them out.

First of all, the ground-based subplot with Glenn Close as the vice president is boring and just detracts from the movie's momentum.  Also, it's kind of interesting that the evil Secret Service agent tries to kill Harrison Ford at the end, even though none of the other villains are left to expose him and he could walk away without ever being suspected.  There was some scene that actually explained WHY that guy was betraying the president, but thanks to some boneheaded editing it was cut out of the movie and that character was reduced to just another stock villain.  In addition, almost all of the action sequences are sick mockeries of reality.  Granted, I can sort of go along with having that much random automatic gunfire on an airplane without losing cabin pressure.  But it's just ridiculous when the characters stand next to a big open hatch without getting sucked out into the sky and their hair just blows in the wind like they're standing in front of a movie studio fan.  And the most unintentionally funny moment has to be when the plane crashes-- the whole shot, one of the most awful CG effects I've seen in a big studio movie, is pathetic and kind of sad.  I don't understand why this film has been so successful and popular, especially since we've all seen MUCH better action movies from directors like James Cameron and John McTiernan.  Cameron could make a better movie than this standing on his head.  Sure the DVD is a nice way to show off your sound system, but there's something seriously wrong if you consider that reason enough to go out and buy this movie...",972000000,3,1664,4.629251700680272

It is definately the the best DVD I know, not meaning the best movie, but the best DVD.  It's maximum impact! The sound, the images, so crisp and clear, as close to theater quality as humanly possible!  The DVD I think  will even have a chance of surpassing it is Jurassic Park, but we'll have to wait a see if that's true.
Of course the movie itself is nothing to sneeze at, it's fantastic!  Wolfgang Peterson is a brilliant director, only he, mabye John McTiernan (director of Die Hard) could make an action movie this well.  The sound is incredible, the special effects are superb (except for in the last scene) the score is rich and patriotic (hats off to Jerry Goldsmith) and the acting, well let me tell you about the acting.
Harrison Ford, finaly a president you can like!  His acting is unsurpassed as always, heck we even finaly get to see Harrison Ford cry in this film!  And who makes him cry?  Only the 2nd craziest actor in hollywood, Gary Oldman (Christopher Walken being the first)  His portrayel of a Neo-Russian Radical is believable and terrifying.  The other actors are fair in their roles.
I had one problem with the film though, parts of it were kind of confusing.  You find out right in the beginning who let the terrorists on the plane, yet the guy always seems to be on the good guys side even when he's fighting the terrorists, and oh, it's just too confusing to think about.  The action of the film is so intense though that you'll hardly notice the first time, but once you've watched the film as many times as I have, you might notice.

The special effects were lacking in some areas though, as is the realism. I remember one scene when Ford is clearly shown in the movie to have ONE H&K MP5 submachine-gun. Yet, he uses about 50 rounds of ammo with one MP5 (the magazine can only hold 30). Yes, for you non-gun fanatics, I'm not making any sense, but that scene was just funny to me. And nevertheless, after he appears the run out of ammo on that gun, he conviently finds another terroist to steal one from. Very funny if you watch it a couple of times.

The KC-10 Tanker blowing up is spectacular along with the USAF F-15 fighters attacking the MiG's.  The air to air rescue is believable from an operations standpoint but it takes two very skilled pilots to maintain speed and altitude for the transfers.  The crash of AFO looks a a bit cheesy--could have been better done.  The Jerry Goldsmith score is thundering and plays well over a nice sound system.

After watching this action phenomenon you can rack you mind of your  own family dedication.  With wonderful acting (Harrison Ford, Gary  Oldman, Glen Close, and Liesel Matthews), astounding special affects, and  suspense thick enough to cut with a knife this film can easily become a  personal favorite.

Before take-off, a camera crew boards the plane, headed by Gary  Oldman. Soon, the camera crew is revealed as being a group of terrorists  who begin killing at random and hold the remaining survivors hostage in  return for the release of their leader. Ford makes the president a true  hero as he tries to stop the plane and the terrorists, and the story never  stops moving as things unfold. However, the special effects are not  believable in all places, and while the majority of the shots look honestly  true, there is always something to give away the computer wizardry.

If you're fortunate enough to have a decent home theatre  setup with digital surround sound, then you're in for an aural treat with  this one.

I've  watched the film twice in the past week, with different family members, and  everyone has enjoyed the experience. While some might criticise the  unbelievability of certain story elements, I don't think a movie of this  kind is meant to be taken too seriously.

The cold-war is over but that hardly means that some don't want to exert their muscle  over the United States. This high-flying adventure is not just another  ""airplane got hijacked"" type of movie. Rather, it is a special  effects and stunt extravaganza which stretches the last vein of adrenaline  and uses a great line-up of actors to do so. Harrison Ford leads the free  world as well as the 40,000 foot high adventure as President James  Marshall. A group of pro-Soviet patriates, led by who else but the most  convincingly psychotic actor on screen, Gary Oldman , have taken over the  presidential aircraft known as Air Force One in order to grab the Western  world by the  b---s (and they do a thorough job of it) in order to ensure  that their leader, one General Radek, played by Jurgen Prochnow, ( Das  Boot, The Man Inside,  English Patient) is freed in order for him to  attempt to restore his regime and take a shot at the title of the being new  Stalin. The cast also includes Glenn Close as the swift-thinking,  decision-making (or is she?)  vice-president and Wendy Crewson, who has  appeared in such films as The Doctor and To Gillian, On Her 37th Birthday,  as the First Lady.

There is no deeper meaning, hidden emotion, political statement, or anything along the lines of what makes a movie great.  Above all, it is far  from showing the directing talent Peterson proved in ""Das Boot.""  AFO isn't a BAD movie.  It's just not a GOOD movie either.  ""Das  Boot"" was a classic.  ""In the Line of Fire"" was a pretty  good movie.  AFO comes in last.  The movie was filled with impressive  action sequences, but that is not the reason people go out to see movies  anymore.  Take ""Wild Wild West"" for a recent example.  On the  defense for the movie, Gary Oldman does a good job as a POed pro-Soviet  Russian idealist tyring to free a profound Soviet officer from a Russian  prison.  That part is not far fetched.  There are quite a few profound  pro-Soviet factions in Russia.  Many of them have high powers in the  government.  The idea that the next in command leader of one of them can  manage to hijack Air Force One with the mysterious help of the Secret  Service (hmm...maybe his reason for joining them will be in the Special  Edition) is where the plot becomes ridiculous.  As always, Harrison Ford  plays...Han Solo.  How he manages to be one of my favorite actors still  puts me at awe.

Wolfgang  Petersen, the maker of the terrifically gripping ""Das Boat"",  directs here and lends the film a terrific sense of claustrophobia. The  cat-and-mouse game Ford plays with the terrorists will leave the audience  on the edge of their seat. Ford is the idealization of what every American  wants his Chief Executive to be- tough, a man of action, resourceful. The  same way Cary Grant and Humphrey Bogart were film icons of the 1940s and  50s, Ford will come to be remembered as one of the great actors of the 80s  and 90s. His casting could not have been better.
Jerry Goldsmith's music  here is good, but not great (his score for ""U.S. Marshals"" was  better). I wasn't overly thrilled with Gary Oldman's performance as the  leader of the Russian terrorists (a little over-the-top at times) and I  wonder if the Russian nationalist plot hasn't been overdone by Hollywood. I  also didn't buy the climactic final rescue of the President from the  crashing plane. The rest of the cast is quite good however, and the action  is exciting.
On the balance, a pretty darn good movie.",950054400,,1430,4.818930041152264
6983,5,0767803434,"If you like a ""edge of your seat"" movie then check out Air Force One and you will not be dissapointed. I originally saw it in the theater and the DVD does it justice (especially if you're watching it in a  home-theater setting!). Watching the movie with the Director's narration is  almost as good as the movie itself.
Harrison Ford's character is a bit  too honest and upright to be a believable president but he put in what I  think is one of his best performances to date. Gary Oldman is very  effective in his role as a Kazakhstani who is willing to die for his cause  and injected a tremendous amount of energy into the film.
What makes this  movie work is that you get to watch something happen that is improbable and  that is something audiences can't get enough of (example: Independace Day ,  etc). Yes, there are some technical aspects of the story that you need to  be willing to overlook, like terrorists walking  onto Air Force One posing  as journalists (yes, reporters really do fly on the plane, but they are  ""familiar faces"" to the crew).
So if you are thinking about  adding this movie to your collection, do it! You will enjoy every minute of  it!",949449600,9,1167,4.464454976303317
6993,4,0767803434,"I found this film to be highly entertaining, although somewhat unrealistic.  I can accept this because, as a work of fiction, it is precisely that--unrealistic.  It had its moments of implausibility, but  overall these were forgiveable since we get to see a President who is  honorable, decent, and faithful to his beliefs and family--another huge  point of fiction considering the current administration.  The plane is a  bit different from the real thing (so I have been told), but that's ok.  Nothing presented in the plane is ""beyond belief.""  Even the  ""bullet resistant"" cabin is possible.  The movie is about  ""What if...""  Enjoy it for what it is.",949276800,2,655,5.009345794392523
6994,3,0767803434,"Air Force One!  Typical blockbuster movie with material that everyone would've seen one time or another.  The one thing that pulls it through however is the fact that they have Harrison Ford in the lead.  Unfortunately, this doesn't help the Devil's Own!
  Are we actually  meant to feel sorry for the plight of a terrorist?  Even though it's a  fellow country man, no-one would condone the killing of innocent people.  This appears to be what Harrison's character struggles with in this movie  as he has a dilema of wethering to kill Pitt or not.
  This movie may  go down well in America due to strong Irish roots, but in Britain, where  these acts of terrorism were faced on a weekly basis, it will bomb.
  This double pack is good value for money and I can see it going down really  well with Harrison Ford fans.  The sad fact is though, these two movies,  just like Seven Days, Seven Nights' are designed for the cinema.

6997,2,0767803434,"In a grand attempt to instill a healthy dose of national fear during these glory days of booming economy and virtual peace, Air Force One puts Harrison Ford in the only good guy-type role he has left to play--dream President of the U.S. of A.
AFO, like those Clancy-based  political-actioners, is technically pretty snazzy. But it also suffers from  a ham-fisted arrogance.  I mean, who would have thought we'd actually see a  movie where the prez himself becomes the super-dude (Bilbo Clinton would  need to cut down on the cheeseburgers, lose the gray, and run four million  laps around the White House to be up to such a task).
The minor  cleverness of AFO stems from director Wolfgang Peterson's ability to set an  unbelievable situation squarely in the realm of the possible, kind of.  Sometimes it works, but the apple pie propaganda gets pretty gooey,  especially toward the end.  A Presidential sounding horn section plays in  the background every time Marshall kicks a vodka-drinking scuzball in the  groin, and the brow-beating of the first family becomes a melodramatic  hoot.
That's AFO in a nutshell: simple-minded jingoism masked as  escapist adventure.",945388800,,1167,5.068421052631579

7018,4,0767803434,"Air Force One's premise does require quite a bit of suspension of disbelief, but this is easily done with the fine acting of Harrison Ford, Glen Close, and Gary Oldman.
But what really makes the DVD package so  complete is the commentary by the director.  Instead of some aimless  bantering that often makes up these commentaries, this one is done in an  interview style, which helps keep the discussion on track about the film.  There are only a few times when others films are mentioned within the  commentary, but then the discussion comes right back to the film.
The  disk is double-sided, with one side devoted to the wide-screen format and  the other side for standard.  Although I would have like to seen more  information about the production on the film, the excellent commentary  presented made up for it.",935020800,,815,4.7913669064748206
7019,1,0767803434,"The schlockmeisters, from Hollywood, have surpassed themselves with this offering. It needs more than suspension of disbelief to be entertained here, a full-frontal lobotomy is almost a prerequisite.

It is so over-the-top and patently absurd in its action sequences that it actually can't rate as a movie in the genre of a thriller; it's more like a self-parody of an action movie. What's missing is the canned laughter to give this movie some form of legitimacy and classification as to what the producer had in mind when he dished this up to the public.

Yes, every respectable critic has alluded to the spraying of hundreds of rounds machinegun fire inside a pressurised cabin of a 747, but what we have here is a President who's a  master of armed and unarmed combat; an Avionics Engineer -  a man adept at doing anything in a crisis situation. We can also add: the perfect, caring and reassuring father and husband; maybe, we can include gynaecologist to his rather impressive list of credentials as well.

This guy can hang outside a plane flying at 550mph at 38,000ft in -60 degrees Centigrade - if you're not impressed with that, we also see him standing upright on the plane's wing.

Gary Oldman has played the arch villain once too often, his  acting is becoming banal, predictable and synthetic; it's almost as if he doesn't believe in his character anymore - he's simply bored by the  monotonous, one-dimensional, stereotyped role of the baddie.

As for the role of Glenn Close as V.P. - she should know better. The scenes in the war room with the false sentiments of angst, anticipation, anxiety and, finally, overwhelming relief and joy...... it was cringingly awful.

Somehow, I can't help but think, that those viewers who raved  about this movie spend their vacation in the Grand Canyon searching for  conclusive proof that the coyote is still chasing after the Roadrunner.",930441600,12,1891,4.893416927899686

Of course, anyone watching this movie  should realize that it is only that, a story, but what a story! My only  regret is that he did not play the part of the President as Dr. Jack Ryan,  as in Tom Clancy's books - ""Debt of Honor"" and ""Executive  Orders.""  This would have then put it all in perspective as the real  President - then ""Air Force One.""  Harrison Ford and Tom Clancy  would have billionaires instead of multi-millionaires!!

7040,5,0767803434,"Air Force One is the very first DVD that I viewed after setting up the viewing software on my PC.  I have to admit that I'm a Harrison Ford fan, and I'm not picky about looking for ""subtext"" or a deep message  within a film.  This is an action film, and it delivers, with the usual  fine performance from Harrison Ford, a reasonable performance from Glenn  Close, and a Gary Oldman-esque performance from Gary Oldman (those who've  seen The Fifth Element will know what I mean).
As a DVD demo, Air Force  One couldn't be better.  In widescreen mode, the video is rich in  detail--especially the night scenes, and my eyes kept panning back and  forth to try to drink it all in.  The effects are what you would expect,  and are rendered flawlessly on my Pentium II-350 w/8MB ATI Rage Pro video  card.  The MPEG decoding was in software, but the ATI board provides motion  correction; even the stills seen when I clicked ""pause"" didn't  suffer from hardware motion-blur or interlacing.
An unexpected bonus: all  of the firearms-handling was by-the-book:  finger OFF the trigger when not  actually shooting, good muzzle discipline, etc.  No child is going to learn  bad habits from *this* movie (certainly no young child should be watching  it anyway due to the graphic violent content), and it's very refreshing to  see, after the usual spate of know-nothing miseducation-through-idiocy that  comes out of Hollywood.
The Director's Commentary version of the film is  a nice feature.  Unfortunately, I had to have the disc back to the rental  store (as it was, it was a day late), so I didn't have time to watch it  very far.  The theater trailer is also on the disc, as are multilingual  subtitles and multiple choices for audio.  The sound quality is very good,  and pointed up the need for me to get better speakers for this setup (or  spring for a DVD player, appropriate--yet affordable--widescreen TV, and  better speakers for the living room).
