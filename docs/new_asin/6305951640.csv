1110540,5,6305951640,"A more than slight change (for the better) from the origanal tv series. I love this movie, the plot is so engulfing that once I started watching it, I couldn't stop. Set in the future, Labors (mechs) are very common. When some of the work labors go on the rampage and start reiking havok, it's up to Azuma, Noah and her labor Alphonse to get to the top of this mystery and solve it. The animation is beautiful with simply awesome city shots and stunning character animation. The character design is great. Everyone has a different personality, which brings life to this great anime. Like other reviewers have said, this isn't an action packed movie (though it does have its moments), but don't let that discurage you from buying it. All in all, this is one of my favorite animes (ranking up there with Akira, Mononoke, and M.P.). Get your stinking credit card and buy it!!",977702400,,872,4.596153846153846
1110541,2,6305951640,"I purchased this movie have never seen it before. I thought that it would be a safe bet because of all the stellar reviews of it. After all people were comparing it to Ghost in the Shell and Princess Mononoke, it had to be good.
Unfortunatly, I did not find it to be entertaining at all... in fact, I was just waiting for it to end. The plot was slow, and the characters were developed poorly. I agree that it was a bit thought provoking, but there wasn't too much to think about, its no Ghost in the Shell in this aspect.
Also, the animation is a bit dated, which would be ok if the series lived up to the standards of films such as Castle of Caglistro, but it doesn't. I cannot reccomend the purcahse of this film, though with all of the other positive reviews, you might want to think about renting it to see if it suits your fancy.",976320000,4,835,4.160493827160494
1110542,5,6305951640,"Every episode, every movie. It's not so much the machines nor the tech that makes the series so appealing to me. It's the characters themselves  and the way that they interact with each other. After a few episodes, one  can see the little quirks and ideosyncracies of each, and little bits of  humor pop out of nowhere. Of course, it does help if you understand  Japanese. The emotional content and impact gets soooo lost in the  translation. :)",966902400,,445,4.653846153846154
1110543,4,6305951640,"Patlabor is one of the finest animated films to come out of Japan. My only problem is that the DVD has so many bugs in it, it almost ruins the film.  Pixelated globs appear on the opening credits, still shots shudder and  frames freeze when the layers switch over. In addition the hacks at Manga  made a decision to ""pan & box"" this film (a disgusting state  between true letterboxing and pan & scan). If Mr. Oshii were dead, he'd  be rolling in his grave over this rubbish DVD.",966816000,4,478,4.325842696629214

7899580,5,6305951640,"Actually, this DVD is a replacement of an Anime that was stolen from me years ago.
It's a great movie for fans of Anime (Classic Anime).
To me the current offerings are total garbage.",1274054400,,183,4.411764705882353
7899581,5,6305951640,"I have a small collection of anime which is growing exponentially now, thanks in part to my renewed interest in the genre after viewing this film. What seperates this from many anime is it unique use of the Mecha of ""Labors"" in its plot, instead of just the same robot battle fair that we've all seen. The movie does not centure around action but around the actual story and the characters as they work together (and sometimes against each other) to solve the big mystery in time to stop the terrible threat to Tokyo and possibly the entire world.",1128816000,2,547,4.5353535353535355
7899582,5,6305951640,"I need to start by saying I have not watched anything but the Patlabor Movies so I have no clue what the series is all about.  I also need to say that I bought this film on the heels of watching Macross Plus, my favorite anime EVER, and was expecting an action mech film.  Boy was I suprised.

The first time I watched this, I literally fast forwarded through most of it to get the the action.  Imagine my dismay when I got there and there seemed to be NONE!  I threw down the movie in disgust and left.

Weeks later my friend who got me into Anime saw it and asked to watch it.  I told him I thought it was crap but why not.  This time...I actually watched the movie and I was blown away with its deep story, amazing imagination and palpable theme of discovery and mystery.  For plot line and story, look at the other reviews, I'm just here to give opinion.

Patlabor uses Labors, or mecha, not as show stealing engines of destruction but as obvious evolutions of police enforcement.  As such, there is no flashy gundam style energy exchange or more deliberate destruction of the mechwarrior fame.  But what you do get is a deep plot of industrial espionage, mysterious dissapearences and a suprisingly realistic look at what future law enforcement would actually look like, detective work too.

In the end, I realized that all anime need not be about amazing action.  Patlabor has a pretty good action scene towards the end but that is not why I suggest this movie.  I say watch this because it shows what anime can also bring to our DVD players.  A well written, well studied movie that would probably crash at the box office because everyone expects it to shoot stuff.",1098403200,17,1672,4.4506578947368425
7899583,1,6305951640,"This is a typical hackjob by Manga Entertainment , they have the licensed dvd release but don't buy it b/c it is damaged goods before you the consumer even view it! There are two specific parts in the beginning and towards the climax of the film that are technically show OBVIOUS damage and carelessness on the part of inspection prior to dvd duplication.
FOr those of you who already own the dvd or are renting it, test these times on your dvd and you will understand why this reviewer is highly disappointed in Manga's poor  job on dvd that should've been anything to the contrary.
@ 3:12 after the attack helicopter zooms in you will see a full screen of UGLY pixellation. This crap was NOT on the VHS release by Manga. They failed to catch it and fix it.
@ 1:08:40 after Asuma says ""We're going to sink the Ark"", you see the mechanics prepare SV2 Labors and the carriers for armored protection and adding aquatic gear to the carrier. Here you will notice a break in sound and freezing of the frame. This too was NOT on the VHS release. Once again Manga failed to check their masters BEFORE sending them to replication.
Does anyone else feel that this is utterly unacceptable for a professionally licensed product? If I wanted damage or an otherwise less than stellar product I should've just bought the VHS copy since it will degrade with viewing.

These flaws should NOT be on any dvd. I mean come on, a dvd should be flawless! Crap, any damage prior to mastering the dvd is unacceptable. I recommend anyone who has this dvd and tests for these defects, WRITE to Manga Entertainment, maybe if enough consumer demand it they will actually check their copy. But one thing that cannot be denied Patlabor Movie 1 DVD is a damaged product, do NOT buy it until it is fixed by Manga Entertainment.
Do not buy this dvd for Patlabor the Movie 1 UNTIL the people at Manga who hold the license, get off their duffs and FIX the technical problems! As previously stated there are two glitches which include a horrible full screen pixellation and a freeze frame and break in sound and play! This is unacceptable for any dvd, especially anime where every frame is noticable. THis is a excellent story made bad by technically fixable problems, but Manga failed to do so. IF you own this already test the areas and see for yourself!",1023840000,16,2320,4.547846889952153
7899584,5,6305951640,"People looking for gore should turn to Ninja Scroll (my favorite movie, which I highly recommend).  I think it's refreshing to see an anime that contains very little violence.  It operates on detective work and technology.
The story takes place in the near future.  Labors are robots that humans operate, and they're used for policing.  The robots have been going berzerk; E. Hoba, the person who wrote the program for the labors, committed suicide, so it's not like anyone can turn to him.  Also, it seems that Hoba was the one who created the bug in the labors anyhow.
Noah and Azuma take matters into their own hands and begin to investigate.  They're basically only rookies, and it's hard for them to get approval from their superiors.  It makes for quite the interesting story.  I liked it a lot.",1016323200,4,801,4.712230215827338
7899585,4,6305951640,"If you're wondering where to start in investigating anime this is a great place to start.  The plot is easy to follow, and very enjoyable, especially for westerners (who are not versed in the eastern mindset or oriental paradigms), yet it doesn't compromise when it comes to the dramatic asian animation style. As to the dialog: I wish DVD producers would offer two English dubbed versions: original and PG-rated so my younger kids could watch this.",1002153600,,449,4.907894736842105
7899586,4,6305951640,"Let me start by saying that the movie itself rates a 5-star.  I'm giving this 4 stars only because I am fairly annoyed at the English dubbing because it is obiously aimed more at children.  This is NOT a movie which should be treated this way.  If you're not fluent in Japanese (I only know barely enough Japanese to tell if a translation is WAY off), watch this one with the literal English subtitles. OK, a passing knowlege of post-WWII Japan helps a lot too, but that's true of any of the great Japanese Animes (Akira, Ghost in the Shell, etc).  OK, to be fair, it's probably to keep a more PG rating since this Anime doesn't feature gratuitous sex, outfits as not-there as Jennifer Lopez's Acadamy Awards gown, or naked, bathing females with large bouncy...ehm...you get the idea.
While not quite as ""deep"" as Ghost in the Shell, it is still definately more of a thinking person's Anime than an animated Action/Adventure flick.  As with other Anime directed by Oshii Mamoru, defitately worth buying, if only to save money on the rental fees, because this is one to watch multiple times to catch the dramatic layers you'll miss the first couple times.
If you enjoy Drama and Anime, this is a great one to get.  If you are looking more for giant robots destroying each other then there a wealth of other amime with less drama and more action to suit your taste.",993686400,6,1363,4.565573770491803
7899587,4,6305951640,"You know, in the days of fast cars, fast music(and fast lifespans for music), fast women, fast food, and any thing else that can be concidered fast(let me know if there is anything I have left out), sometimes, you need to slow down a bit. Starting with Shenmue, I came to the conclusion that not every thing has to be fast paced to be enjoyable. As far as movies go, Patlabor fits that bill quite nicely.
More of a crime drama/exploration film, I think the first thing that jumped out at me is the direction. Mamoru Oshii did an excellent job with not only the cinamatagraphy, but the setups as well. Needless to say, nothing felt jarring at all in the movie. Another thing that helped the tone of the movie was the soundtrack. The soundtrack was very well composed(not something I normally say about anime soundtracks. Especially with j-pop openings).
To me, the movie is kinda of an exploration of man and his machines. Man creates machine. Man becomes dependent on machine. Man, therefore becomes machine. It seems as though the antgonist in this movie saw this horrible revolation and commits suicide. Not before sending Tokyo to impending doom with his plan(not gonna share details. I have told enough).
I think one thing that would have made this movie better was if I had saw the original TV series(which I hear is pretty good). But alas, no DVD means no purchase as I am now on strict DVD only diet. But even so, the characters were, if not a little under developed, still deffentatly enjoyable. I just wish they had shared a little more background info. Oh well.
Another thing that I thought worked to its advantage, was the lack of gratuitous mech action. I myself am not big mecha fan. But when the scenes that had the mechs in them were, from my standpoint, more emphasised, made it better. Rather than mindless battles that was one of many elements that made Gundam Wing hard to watch.
Overal, good movie that is well directed and has cool storyline. Not fast paced fare but I was able to mangage. After all, Vampire Princess Miyu is one of my favorite animes. And that is pretty slow anime. Oh well, guess its not for everyone.",985046400,,2141,4.592689295039165
