6546696,4,B00M1YSS7K,"Not sure why this didn't get more attention. Except for the brain scan scene (which I'll admit, was cringe-worthy), I thought this was a great little feel-good story. Simon Pegg is fantastic.",1423180800,3,191,5.0
6546697,5,B00M1YSS7K,"The world is divided into two kinds of people, those who know about this secret masterpiece of a film and those who don't.  It's a mystery how this movie didn't get an Academy Award nomination.  Masquerading as a comedy-drama, It's easily the most important film made in the last five years.  More like this please, Hollywood.  Glad I can finally get the DVD, but where's the hell is the Blu-Ray?!",1421712000,8,397,4.628571428571429
6546698,5,B00M1YSS7K,"Without a doubt, my favorite film of 2014. It will change the way you think about your life in a very positive way. Funny and very charming. Unique. This same director made two of my all time fave movies: Serendipity and Funny Bones. I cannot recommend this more highly! Loved it, AND so did everyone I know who saw it.",1421625600,16,319,4.333333333333333
6546699,4,B00M1YSS7K,"Watched this one with the hubby and he watched the whole movie with me. That is always a good sign since he is famous for leaving after 20 or 30 minutes.
A lot of the statements about happiness that were made in the movie made me consider my own life. Everyone searches for what they consider happiness to be. This film showed an adventurous and inspirational way to figure that out. That is also what makes the movie so good though. Not everyone has the luxury of taking off on a self-discovery trip around the world for who-knows-how-long. That sense of freedom, excitement, and adventure is what keeps the viewer entertained since it is so far out of a normal person's reach.
I haven't read the book it is based from, didn't even know there was one till seeing the film. Doubt I will read it now, but I wonder how much alike they are.
Lots of people are going to love this movie. Beware, you will get choked up a few times.",1421625600,17,926,4.358381502890174
6546700,4,B00M1YSS7K,"This film is better than expected as the advance information and trailer does not convey the depth of the acting of the lead character. He, the psychiatrist, is able to show a range of emotions in all types of situations and works hard to keep it honest. Possibly the girlfriend he leaves behind at home while he goes off on his adventure acts a little off the top but then she has to do a lot of it while talking on the phone or video conference.  The one bright moment she brings on is when she thinks he is dumping her and blurts it out.

The location scenery is a vibrant mix of China, Africa and even back yard with swimming pool Los Angeles. But best of all everyone involved exhibits energy and a love for a unique adventurous script without monsters or robots. But it does have enjoyable cartoon sequences reminiscent of James Thurber and Walter Mitty.

Bottom line- a nice change of pace movie where the viewing audience is not insulted or led astray.",1417996800,5,960,4.443181818181818
6546701,5,B00M1YSS7K,"A typical psychiatrist, this guy is always searching for happiness. What could have been a soppy, maudlin exercise in mediocrity, is instead an extremely well-acted comedy with more than its share of drama and excitement. Based on Francois Lelord's novel ""Le voyage d'Hector ou la recherche de bonheur,"" this R-rated comedy, co-written and directed by Peter Chelsom (Shall We Dance -2004), includes adventure in exotic places, e.g., China, Tibet, Africa and Los Angeles, plus domestic drama in London; so you'll get your money's worth.

Here is the cast:
  * Simon Pegg (""The World's End"") Hector wants to know what makes people happy around the world. He is pretty sure HE isn't, but wants to see what happiness looks like. We start with our hero in his well-ordered home and watch it all come apart.
  * Rosamund Pike (""Jack Reacher"") Clara very capably keeps the home fires burning. Isn't that enough to make him happy? Considering what she finds in the sock drawer, maybe not....
  * Stellan Skarsgrd (""Thor: The Dark World"") Edward says Hector is the last person on earth with whom he would want to spend any time. Watch his face as our clumsy hero takes a seat next to him in First Class!
  * Toni Collette (""Lucky Them"") Agnes conveys more with a glance than most actors with pages of dialogue. Yup! Hector is in for a session of TRUTH!
  * Jean Reno (""Alex Cross"") Diego tries to dismiss happiness...and our hero ...with prejudice. At least a psychiatrist understands pharmaceuticals.
  * Christopher Plummer (""Elsa and Fred"") Popular Professor Coreman TEACHES happiness! With wit, understanding and hi-tech tools.

The travel aspects of this film provide an authentic feel for various parts of the world, even though he stays in touch with that Tibetan monk via Skype! I also enjoyed it when Hector lost patience with his patients. BTW, the diary in which he records his journey is a delight.

There is not a weak actor in this roster, but Collette and Skarsgrd deserve special mention. I'd like to remind you that Pegg is versatile and talented, in case you have him typecast as ""just"" a comic. I always expect his characters to have a sweet center, and Hector delivers. I've pre-ordered my DVD from Amazon.",1417737600,22,2217,4.85904255319149

6546713,1,B00M1YSS7K,"It was a chore to sit through this.  Not the normal Simon Pegg movie, and the star rating is deceiving.

This is a journey-type movie, and pretty poor at that.  If you want to see a journey movie, you'd be better off with City Slickers.  Same template, same soul-searching, but entertaining.",1515110400,,291,4.647058823529412
6546714,5,B00M1YSS7K,What a wonderful movie. Simon Pegg is amazing in this role. An adventure for the heart and for the eyes. Definitely watchi this movie.,1514332800,,134,4.625

6546717,4,B00M1YSS7K,"Hector(Simon Pegg) is a highly professional therapist of whom seems to have it all with his beautiful and loving wife, having the best clothing and house, and being a very caring and methodical therapist.  All of this just seems to lose all of it's purpose to Hector as he starts to doubt his abilities as a therapist and as a result one day he blows up at a patient.  Hector them wishes to discover where to go in the world to seek any form of happiness to hope to have a much stronger chance of curing his patients.  So Hector takes off to see the world and find the answer.

While Hector does find some forms of happiness and even takes regular notes with statements regarding what happiness and life are philosophically hypothesized by Hector and even other people, Hector also has the misfortune of running into the less cheery side of his journeys as well.

This movie truly goes into the human spirit in many kids of ways.  Hector in his journey,sometimes finds people that are good samaritans and that want to make it their life's purpose to help others, some that need people like that as they are sick and ailing, physically wounded, or just miserable with their day to day lives.  Unfortunately, their are the other kinds of people that look to take what they feel is theres by any force necessary(even illegal) and strongly see that as the happiness that they need. This movie also delves into learning to let go of the past and be strong for yourself and others once you do.  The matter of the rewards for doing good and even the unfortunate punishments are also covered here.  This movie does indeed balance it all out.

Simon Pegg puts in one of his strongest performances as he still gives you a bit of his wacky and quirky Brit humor but he also covers the dramatic end of his Hector character all too well proving that Simon isn't just a goofy and zany British comedian but is also is a very good dramatic actor.",1512691200,,1930,4.488571428571428

6546727,5,B00M1YSS7K,"If you're a fan of Simon Pegg and his humor, yet love deep emotional movies that make you think as well (such as Collateral Beauty), you'll find this to be the perfect mix. It has the comedy that you find in all of Simon Pegg's work, yet it'll poke you in the back of your mind to really stir up how you feel about happiness and get you thinking. 5/5, I can't stop re-watching this movie time and again. Every time I do, I catch something I didn't the times before and continuously spur my thoughts on how I see the world and my own views of life. Highly recommend.",1504656000,2,565,4.1454545454545455

6546730,5,B00M1YSS7K,"In so many ways, predictable. Yet that doesn't make it meaningless or less fun. In fact, there's quite a bit of foreshadowing in the beginning that watching a second time illuminates. The boingy-bouncy soundtrack makes this seem comedic, but it really isn't a ""laugh out loud"" movie with wild high jinks. Wild things happen, but they are dangerous or exciting or heartfelt. And Hector never loses his humanity, often offering his own wisdom to help others. Delightful movie.",1499385600,,474,5.089743589743589

6546744,2,B00M1YSS7K,"Yes, I agree with most reviewers here: ""Hector and the Search for Happiness"" is a warm, fun, well-acted and at times hilarious romp through the various nations of the world. But when it's all said and done you realize how trite, simpleminded and emotionally manipulative it's all been. Worst of all, the film is marred by an overly fairy-tale-like ending that makes you wonder what the journey was for in the first place. Let's fast-forward 5-10 years in the future, when Hector and Clara are bored to death with each other, the sex is non-existent and there are 3-4 snot-nosed brats running screaming around the house. What then? Hector needs to go on another search for happiness?",1483228800,,682,4.837606837606837

I agree with others who have said this movie can bring emotions to the surface. Keep a box of Kleenex close by. I say that with the caveat that the tears you shed with be sympathetic tears and not tears prompted by tragedy on the screen.

I agree with the reviewer who said that not many people can afford to travel the way Pegg's character did. However, many people don't realize that if you put aside a few dollars every week, you can afford to travel on a cheap ticke to an exotic place where you can stay in a hostel and live on cheap sandwiches during your stay.

6546812,2,B00M1YSS7K,"This film concerns Hector, a psychiatrist and a ""tidy"" man who enjoys the predictability of his routines. He's actually more of an analyst; psychiatrists are medical doctors who prescribe drugs to their patients. Typically, they don't have lengthy sessions where they listen to their clients' problems and offer advice, but that distinction is beyond most people, so the filmmakers apparently saw no need to make a distinction. One day, for no apparent reason, Hector must drop everything and go on an adventure, which takes him across the world, where he meets a wealthy businessman, a beautiful Chinese girl, a drug lord, paramilitaries, and manages to catch up with two old friends who seem to have found the ""happiness"" which eludes him. Throughout, Hector records in his journal his observations on what ""happiness"" is - ""loving two women at the same time,"" ""not knowing the whole story,"" and so on.

Hector might have just been burned out and in need of a vacation - maybe he could have just lounged on the beach in Cancn for a few weeks, sipping margaritas - but that wouldn't have been much of a story. Unexplained is the romance between the hot Rosamund Pike and the dweebish Simon Pegg - why wasn't he happy with her waiting for him - and on him - at the end of every day? And what did she see in him?

Putting aside the ""happiness"" factor, the film falls into the larger category of stories where the protagonist embarks on a voyage to find some truth about themselves, and as such, doesn't come close to the seriousness and maturity of a film like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Meetings-with-Remarkable-Men/dp/B0114861WC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Meetings with Remarkable Men</a>, or Hermann Hesse's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Siddhartha/dp/0553208845/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Siddhartha</a>, which, though not a movie, may be the best example of the genre. Mere happiness is too small a topic, and too elusive; as Walt Whitman asked, ""What real happiness have you had one single hour through your whole life?"" Like everyone else, Hector is looking in the wrong place; but since it's Hollywood, it doesn't matter.",1451520000,,2221,5.4723032069970845

Had it not been so late, I started to watch it again just to make sure I didn't miss anything. I have always wanted to meet Simon just based on his funny movies especially Shaun of the Dead was funny and very well done, but this is up there.

Starring Simon Pegg and Rosamund Pike with appearances by Stellan Skarsgard , Jean Reno, Christopher Plummer, Toni Collette.

Ultimately, Hector is supposed to discover what makes him happy, but you never get the sense that he is evolving toward that realization  all of that sudden it just happens, and quite a flat happening it is.  There is some suggestion that Hectors childhood has impacted his adulthood, but that is never really developed, so you never really feel connected to anything thats going on.

6546992,4,B00M1YSS7K,"HECTOR AND THE SEARCH FOR HAPPINESS is an interesting little film that went under my radar last year and while it's not the greatest thing I've ever seen, it is a suitable vehicle for Simon Pegg that has a fair share of heart and laughs. Hector (Simon Pegg) is a psychiatrist who is going through the motions in life, so one day he decides to go on a trip to try and discover the secret(s) to happiness. While this concept is easily dismissible since happiness isn't some magic formula, the journey he goes on is at least enlightening to him and takes us on a whirlwind of emotion. My favorite part of the film is (quite obviously) Simon Pegg. He's just a really likeable guy with a quirky sense of humor who brings his trademark wit to everything he does. Rosamund Pike also does quite well, even though she's relegated to appearing via Skype calls for the entire middle section of the film. There are also cameos by three different actors whose characters each provided a different approach to happiness. If you want know who they are, don't look at the cast list on IMDb and just watch the movie. I also thought that the film balanced drama and comedy quite well. What doesn't quite work is the convoluted nature of the plot and the contrived situations which Hector gets himself into. I'm all for a movie manipulating my emotions, but it has to do it cleverly. To its detriment, I don't feel like this film was that clever, bordering on cliche far too often. Ultimately, the conclusions the film draws are a combination of common sense and something you might find in a fortune cookie, i.e., nothing terribly profound. But, of course, not everything has to be profound. For what it's worth, I found HECTOR AND THE SEARCH FOR HAPPINESS to be a pleasant, if unchallenging, viewing experience that provided enough laughs and emotional moments to satisfy. If you're a Simon Pegg fan, then definitely check it out. For everyone else, it wouldn't hurt to give it a try.",1428537600,4,1967,4.622857142857143

6546997,5,B00M1YSS7K,"Such a great movie.  So inspirational. Like ""Into the Wild"" with a twist of quirky, funny, realistic human moments.  I loved the question he asked repeatedly,  ""are you happy?"".  Bought movie in the end.  About to watch again ;)",1428192000,,228,4.743589743589744

6547001,5,B00M1YSS7K,"Hector works as a psychiatrist, which is a little ironic because his life is full of many trials that eventually make him feel depressed. And since this is a film with Simon Pegg as the star, you cant bet your dollar that its going to be filled with a hilarious plot. And on a more serious note, Hector And The Search For Happiness, is a film that many people can relate with because we all have messy, scrambled lives. The cards that life dealt Hector will have you sitting at the edge of your seat.

I do think that the film could have pushed more comedy, but I feel that the choices that were made, were done with great taste and good thought. Regardless, the film is a must see because it really will have you laughing even with the clichs throughout the film. Hector And The Search For Happiness, is one film I would recommend watching because of the quirkiness. I can also the cinematography was great, excellent work to the cast and crew.

And after you watch the  Hector And The Search For Happiness, we want to know what you thought. Have you already watched the film? Tell us your thoughts because we want to know what YOU think about the film? If its unique enough we will feature your review on our website.

6547002,4,B00M1YSS7K,Definitely a feel good movie. A reminder that the simple things in life are beautiful and the search for happiness simply appreciating the things and people you have right in front of you.  A little cheesy but great message.,1427846400,,224,4.743589743589744
6547003,5,B00M1YSS7K,Excellent movie.  Always loved Simon Pegg but his performance in this movie is truly note worthy. Fantastic supporting cast - big names that each stole the screen for the brief moments they were there.  Highly recommend.,1427760000,,220,5.083333333333333

6547005,4,B00M1YSS7K,"The movie is quirky.  Simon Pegg and Rosamund Pike are good together.  Pegg's character journeys around the world pursuing happiness, and Pike, his girlfriend and lover, is patient but is coming to the end of her patience.  Shall I say how it works out?  No.  If you want to know, go find a spoiler.  If you're looking for an action thriller, this is not it.  You'll cinematically visit some interesting places and hear some clever lines and, perhaps, have some thought provoking moments in the course of the movie, and afterwards.

6547029,5,B00M1YSS7K,"I read this book a couple years ago, and it was a quick, happy little read. I didn't expect to be wildly impressed by the movie, but it turned out to be one of those rare cases where the movie is actually better than the book. Why? The book is short, and it doesn't go the best job of really capturing the experiences Hector has on the road. It doesn't capture the utterly boring, unsatisfying existence Hector was plodding through before his trip. It describes those things, just not as well as the film version.

In the movie, you get wonderful acting, beautiful scenery, and widely varied pace from place to place. When Hector goes off on a patient in the beginning, you FEEL his frustration with the life he's leading. When he's living the high life in China, you really get a taste of the excitement and anticipation he would surely be feeling. When he finally lets loose and dances with his friends in Africa, you smile because you know he's a changed man.

I'm not saying the book was bad at all, but this is one of those rare cases where the story is better told in film format, and all the right things came together to make it a good one.",1426377600,4,1148,4.359813084112149

6547035,5,B00M1YSS7K,"""Once upon a time there was a young psychiatrist named Hector"" (Simon Pegg). He lives a very ordered and tidy British life and ""he liked it that way"". He loves a devoted woman, Clara (Rosamund Pike) who may be seeing her sweet Hector a bit restless with his life. He seems to have lost his zeal for his job, his patience with his patients, even is questioning whether or not he can help anybody any longer. Actually for Hector nothing has changed in years and he wonders if he knows what happiness even is or if he has ever known it. After one of his patients questions his authenticity, she then tells him he will be going on a great journey. Anjali (Veronica Ferres) is psychic, after all. When he questions Clara about happiness, he tells her that he must go on that journey to see if there is happiness to be found. It's his research, after all. This begins the journey - and the tale of Hector - in distant lands and on a quest for this elusive thing called happiness. He is surprised with a notebook gift that Hector must take along from Clara with her words to do it ""totally"".

He begins globetrotting straight off with a trip to China where he meets a seemingly stuffy buttoned-up Edward (Stellan Skarsgrd). He may not enjoy Hector much on the flight there, but once in China Edward shows Hector what his personal meaning of happiness is. Hector makes great use of his notebook for these ideas, his own ideas, words, drawings, and pictures. Just anything on his mind about happiness as this notebook becomes its own character in Hector's journey. China is only his first stop and Hector has many places to see and people to talk to about happiness. He goes to Tibet and talks with a wise monk at a monastery learning many things about life. He also finds Skype. Next, Hector takes about four separate flights to arrive in Africa to meet a friend, Michael (Barry Atsma) a medical doctor that he has missed. Along the way, the people he meets and talks to fills this tale with the richness and fullness of other's lives and opinions. Other cultures, dangers, livelihoods Hector walks right into at the bar where he meets Diego Baresco (Jean Reno), a ""farmer"" by trade. People wouldn't want to mess with this farmer. Their conversation may be key in a much more dire situation. Africa had me wondering how to make their featured 'Sweet Potato Stew' while Hector wonders about Clara, and if he will make it to Los Angeles.

The last leg of the journey is to see the one that got away: Is she happy? Agnes (Toni Collette) once loved Hector, surely, but there comes a time to get a real life of his own. Spending all this time along with Hector in his search, we have all gathered so much information as has Hector about happiness but mainly about perception. Who hides behind their emotions? Who may be scared of their's entirely? And, Who just needs to ""move on""? Director Peter Chelsom says he has always been fascinated with ""fables and tales"".  He was able to write such a full and detailed experience which packs the viewing audience with so many interesting places, people, and situations. He wanted the perfect Hector and certainly found it in Simon Pegg along with a stellar cast to accompany Hector on his sojourn. Make no mistake, Pegg may be perceived as a very comedic actor, and he is although Pegg has a vulnerability and a plain to see inner-child that he is able to invoke effortlessly. He has such a spectacular range from hilarity to total distress. He runs the gamut of emotions and does it with a loveable charm to become the person that everyone will root for to discover where happiness really does come from. The film is brilliantly atmospheric (Kolja Brandt) as we go continent jumping along with Hector and also with so many people of this world. It's a bright and wonderful tale.

6547039,5,B00M1YSS7K,"What a surprise! How such a wonderful film could fly so low under the radar and avoid the attention of so many is definitely a mystery. Yes it does happen, many good films languish away in obscurity but generally that's the fate for independent films with no budget for promotion  and a cast of unknowns. That's not the case here. 'Hector and the Search for Happiness' contains a delightful ensemble of actors and performances that begins with our two main characters Hector (Simon Pegg) and his love interest Clara (Rosamund Pike). Those two alone are enough to capture my full attention.

This film is delightfully engaging from beginning to end. It will make you both laugh and cry, cause you to question your motives and priorities and encourage you to ponder the meaning of life in a manner that is neither ponderous or pretentious. But most of all it will entertain and delight the viewer with a most unexpected journey that travels both near and far as well as forward and back.

I know sometimes I have forgotten, at some point everybody does. People just have to stop expecting that a movie, no matter how good it is
will magically solve their problems & change their lives forever. there is a lot more here that what you just see on screen & the main story.

We groaned and called out every cliched tagline before the characters uttered it. It's also the sort of movie that uses world travel and tossing its protagonist into a variety of highly unlikely situations as a substitute for actual character development. A movie that's supposedly all about the meaning of love and happiness, it comes up with no answers you couldn't read on a Hallmark valentine card.

8669735,5,B00M1YSS7K,"I was not expecting much of this movie, it was on my watch list for the longest time. Today was one of those days when my ""black dog"" layed me low and I was desperate for anything with happiness in it. This beautiful, lovely, moving, and hopeful film chased that big ol' snarling black dog away and locked him outside from where he couldn't get to me! I know the dog will return again but for now I am hopeful and happy! Such a great film. Give it a chance, it may be the best medicine you've taken in a while!",1528070400,,510,4.0594059405940595
8669736,5,B00M1YSS7K,Great film. Used it as part of a class to help demonstrate Aristotles concept of eudaimonia. It seemed to get the idea across to high school juniors.,1527033600,,149,4.555555555555555
8669737,5,B00M1YSS7K,"Beautifully acted by Simon Pegg and Rosamind pike. Sweet, funny and moving but not so much that your hubby/boyfriend will refuse to watch. Great Saturday night selection when your not in the mood for the latest Avengers and looking for something that is entertaining but a little more meaningful.",1526428800,,296,5.061224489795919

8669739,5,B00M1YSS7K,"Refreshing in theme, but bear with a very difficult rite of initiation.  A very complex tale, not unlike previous movies of Simon Pegg. Why his wife tolerates his eccentric solo quest is one for the textbooks, but all comes together in a very touching and believable outcome. For anyone searching for happiness, this is a real work of art and psychology.  I highly recommend it.",1525305600,,378,4.8
