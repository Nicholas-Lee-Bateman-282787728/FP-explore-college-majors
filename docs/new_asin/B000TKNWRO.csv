2906320,1,B000TKNWRO,"This was not what I was expecting. It is very much like a ballet class, not a workout.

I might recommend it to people who have been doing traditional aerobic dance (Lo impact, Jazzercise, etc) who want to explore ballet style.

But if, like me, you have had years of ballet training and are looking for a cardio workout that doesn't offend your dancer sensibilities, then you might be disappointed.",1211760000,9,399,4.685714285714286
2906321,5,B000TKNWRO,"This was an active, enjoyable workout that started off at a pace that allows you to stretch out and feel comfortable before starting into the energetic portion.  I certainly felt the impact, and certainly put my heart rate into a healthy cardio range.  Even without a dance background, I was quickly able to get into the rhythm of the steps and follow along without much of a learning period.  I think the value benefit of this routine is that it not only gave me a vigorous, blood pumping 50 minutes, but just over the last couple weeks, has helped improve my balance and coordination tremendously.  I highly recommend this as a daily workout for anyone.",1203897600,11,655,4.6695652173913045
2906322,5,B000TKNWRO,"The exercises are varied and intense, like a ballet class.  The pace is quick, for the most part, and requires a good deal of 1)coordination to keep up and 2) grace to really work the muscles correctly.  This is a great workout for those with a dance background, especially in ballet.",1203292800,10,284,4.549019607843137
2906323,5,B000TKNWRO,"Deanna McBrearty is very well known in the ballet community, having danced for the New York City Ballet.  What is unusual about her career is that her fame came not so much as a dancer, but as a model!  While she was working as a ballet dancer, she was used by famous fashion designers to do photo and runway work, often doing ballet steps down the fashion runway!  She can also be seen in the New York City Ballet Workout DVD, modeling ballet clothes in catalogs and demonstrating ballet technique in some books, such as Suki Schorer's ""Balanchine Technique"".  She has also been a great inspiration to many because when she was 12 year old, she had a very serious scoliosis and was told that she needed a metal rod implanted in her spine, which would have made a ballet career imposible.  Instead, she worked hard in her ballet studies and became completely free of all scoliosis in only one year!  Deanna is a very dedicated dancer.  So, when I heard that she had developed her own approach to working out, I became very curious to see what it was, being a ballet dancer myself.
I found this workout to be very useful and enjoyable(the whole point of being a dancer is to enjoy moving!).  She begins with a warmup and then moves on to a floor barre to stretch, strengthen, and warmup further.  The main body of the workout comes next, and comprises the standing exercises, which involve flowing motions using mostly ballet technique.  These make good use of the entire body, including the arms.  They are done to a variety of tempos: medium, fast, and slow.  Finally, there is a cooldown done on the floor.  In addition to this extensive fifty minute workout, there is a generous amount of extras, including Deanna's biography, suggestions on getting the most out of the workout, reactions from those who have taken her Balocity classes(this is the only place where we hear that two men, one a ballet dancer and the other an actor, have also enjoyed her Balocity workout), and even outtakes.
In addition to being a great all-around workout, this is also very helpful for those dance students who are having trouble feeling comfortable with quick routines, since the concept of dancing in a flowing motion is stressed.  This DVD is highly recommended for all those seeking great crossover training, as well as dancers looking for a different type of rhythmic routine.",1202083200,23,2368,4.716019417475728
2906324,5,B000TKNWRO,"The workout is low-impact cardio and tones lower and upper body at the same time.  I could really feel the burn in my legs and shoulders, especially about midway through the workout.  I don't have a lot of dance experience so I was really happy that I was able to keep up with the routine.  At one point I caught my reflection in the mirror and I looked pretty good!  I felt like a star on stage!  The set looks great and I really like the music.  Deanna and her dancers are absolute perfection and they made me feel that way too.  This is definitely going into my weekly rotation.",1201478400,18,581,4.2272727272727275
2906325,5,B000TKNWRO,"The 50 minute workout starts with stretches on the floor using fluid, ballet inspired movement. Then the main standing workout begins and it's more like classic aerobics with a dose of ballet that makes it so fun. I used to dance when younger but now I am looking for ways to burn the calories and have fun doing it. This workout is perfect. I did however find myself trying to mimic every movement down to the way I held my hands and fingers. And the more I concentrated on posture, specifically core muscle groups, the harder the workout got.",1200960000,14,544,4.505050505050505
2906326,4,B000TKNWRO,"No, this is isn't the toughest workout ever, not even close. For cardio, I usually do high-intensity step or kickboxing that is why I was surprised a few drops of sweat started falling down the sides of my face. It is a gentle, low-impact workout. The sweat factor came from the ballet techniques used that demand muscle control. Precise movements are much harder to execute than I would have thought. The choreography was simple but fun. It just felt good to do this workout. My only complaint is that I wished the cardio portion were longer. The first 10 minutes or so are spent doing warm-up and stretching exercises. Maybe 25-30 minutes is cardio. The remaining minutes were spent doing abs and other toning exercises. The set was very pretty and the music was good (no recycled ""workout video music""). Deanna and her backup dancers are beautiful to look at. All three were professional ballet dancers and have beautiful form.  Its nice to have something different to add to my video workout collection.",1192838400,42,1007,4.820809248554913
2906327,4,B000TKNWRO,"This workout gives to exercisers what the NYC Ballet workouts don't: a solid routine with an extended cardio segment, flanked by warm-up stretches and abdominal strengthening work. Other than the somewhat distracting ""deer-in-the-headlights"" look and tele-prompted diction of Deanna at times (although she is still cute as always), this dvd was tastefully arranged, the set was clean and bright, and her professional backup dancers appeared self-assured, mature, and very competent at demonstrating the routine. Although this certainly isn't a ""balls-to-the-wall"", sweating-blood type of workout, it does lend a sense of grace, coordination, and lightness that other aerobic workouts don't. I have been trying out different dance-conditioning dvds, and although I don't expect them to necessarily make me a much better dancer, I do expect them to give me a good, overall body workout, while throwing in some coordination and conditioning moves that will modestly improve my performance in dance technique. I followed this workout with a few Pilates, yoga, and stretching segments (from Jennifer Galardi's ""Ballet Body"" dvd) to round out the entire workout so I felt that I had accomplished a comprehensive body conditioning workout. This dvd is good for beginners, and though some of the movements do require some upper and lower body coordination, over time things will become much easier with practice. I could imagine myself using just the cardio section on days when I want to mix things up with other dvds, for variety. I would recommend this dvd to those looking for a less pounding and more graceful workout.",1275091200,4,1615,5.362204724409449
2906328,5,B000TKNWRO,"I bought this on the recommendation of another member here. I should have known better than to buy a DVD on the recommendation of someone who is a ballet dancer! However,I completed the workout the first time, without too much difficulty and that was after not working out in a while. This was enough to make me work, but improves flexibility and not so jarring that it would hurt the knees.
Depending on what you are looking for, this might not be for everyone. I wanted low impact and something to take the place of pilates when I couldn't take classes.
If you're looking to tone,get more flexible,and have a different take on the usual,this is your workout.",1255219200,4,660,4.601694915254237
2906329,5,B000TKNWRO,"this video has a very effective but unfortunatly short floor bar and stretch section (similar to pilates) and then moves to a great cardio ""dance routine"", its not hard core ballet, and it is very easy to follow.  Really gets the heart rate up and you will SWEAT.  at the beginning it might be best to ignore the arm movements in the cardio section as that can throw you off. It ends with a good abs section, and if you do the whole video each area of the body will be nice and burnt out.  abs, inner/outer thighs, quads, ham strings, butt, calvs.",1247875200,2,547,4.29126213592233
2906330,5,B000TKNWRO,"I would recommend this dvd to just about anyone who would listen to me.  I used to dance, but have gained enough weight that its not longer really feasible, so this is the perfect way to get me back in shape.  Its very easy to modify the exercises to suit your needs.  There are some good stretching and ab sections in it along with about 20 minutes of cardio.  The music is fun, and the moves easy to do.  There is one section where they show a slightly complicated move pretty quickly, so it might take a few tries to figure out, but I was impressed otherwise.  If you like the New York City Ballet Workout dvds and want some cardio, this is great.  Deanna was one of the dancers in those videos and she has taken many moves from that dvd and made them accessible to the average home exerciser and at a faster pace.",1235779200,4,817,4.198717948717949
2906331,1,B000TKNWRO,seemed way too slow! even for this type of workout. very little cardio. Just did not enjoy!,1235174400,,91,4.411764705882353
2906332,3,B000TKNWRO,I ordered this for a small group of ladies who exercise together.  It was a good workout but too fast for our group to keep up.,1228608000,,127,3.8846153846153846
2906333,5,B000TKNWRO,"This workout can make you feel like a dancer, even if you've never put on pointe shoes. I did not expect to work up as much of a sweat as I did, but it moves quickly from routine to routine so you don't get bored and you do work up a good sweat. The moves are easy enough for beginners to follow and the cardio is low impact. I have a lot of ballet inspired videos, but all of them are only barre work with muscle and strength building exercises...which is important too. But it's nice to have a fun and different kind of cardio workout without the typical grapevines and heel digs (we've all done those, right?).  The music is great also with a Moby song and sweet remix of canon in D.  There's nothing wrong with grapevines and heel digs, but sometimes you just want something different and that's exactly what this video is... fun, different, and graceful.",1219795200,12,859,4.3625
2906334,5,B000TKNWRO,"Balocity is an all-around great low-impact workout that I don't mind doing on a daily basis. Best of all, it doesn't hurt my knees, unlike most ballet classes. An upbeat instructor, good music, nice set, and finely-tuned workout.",1215820800,9,229,5.052631578947368
2906335,4,B000TKNWRO,This is a great video for working on your grace and working up some sweat with great movement.  I didn't get bored at all :),1215388800,5,124,3.96
2906336,5,B000TKNWRO,"Having old breaks in my foot, ankle, knee and hip, it is difficult to find a workout that doesn't cause pain somewhere.  Yet, I needed a workout that would work my core and give me a cardio burn.  I didn't expect to find it all in one, honestly, but I kept looking...  I did this workout for the first time today, and really enjoyed it.  I'm not terribly coordinated, so some of the steps combining arms and legs were a bit much for my first day, but they are not overly complex, and by the end of each segment I was putting it all together...  :)  The cardio starts out slow, but picks up the pace, and the toning continues throughout.  Perhaps the best part is that it is fun to do, not just a good workout.  I look forward to doing this workout regularly!",1213574400,14,758,4.179310344827586
8209965,5,B000TKNWRO,Great workout! The soundtrack is awesome and I liked this kind of cardio ballet center barre type workout. It also includes some floor work at the beginning and end.,1526515200,,165,4.724137931034483
8209966,5,B000TKNWRO,"Great workout, but it's better if you are more limber and graceful! Graceful I am not, but I still think this workout will do well for me. It is LONG so make sure you carve out an hour to do this. I was sore after the first time, so I know that it is working. Not sore to where I could not function but sore like I knew I had worked out well. I look forward to seeing how it tones me. Also give yourself time to learn the routines before giving up on it. It can be frustrating at first, and you may think you will never get it, but you do eventually and it is a really good workout. Also don't worry about not being as limber or as posture perfect as these women are, they are ballerinas so they've been taught this form practically from birth, so they're used to it.",1449100800,,767,3.987012987012987
8209967,5,B000TKNWRO,"I have had this DVD for quite a while now, but just tried it out last night.  It will definitely work into my regular rotation.  It is a great workout, not huffing and puffing cardio, but a nice good cardio workout with some strength and flexibility worked in a ballet dance format.  I really enjoyed it in the evening as a wind-down workout.  It has a mostly floor based basic ballet routine with 3-4 ""series"" of dances that are basic, yet enjoyable and a bit challenging (at least to do them correctly).  It is followed by a shorter session of floor work, which was nice to stretch and wind down.  I took ballet growing up, and it was fun to remember the ballet terms and very much like a intro course for adults in ballet at a faster than normal ballet pace.",1431043200,,761,4.323943661971831
8209968,4,B000TKNWRO,"I borrowed this DVD from the library to try it out.  I'm on the fence as to whether to buy it though.  Without a doubt, the workout is challenging and involves beautiful, graceful movements that are fun to do.  This is a ballerina's workout.  Read that to mean, it can be difficult to follow, so if that frustrates you, this workout ain't for you.  Even the stretches and warm-ups involve complicated sweeping movements that can be hard for the non-dancer (me) to get.  But I just think that takes some practice, and I enjoy learning complicated steps and dances.  Hey, at least if I look like a total idiot while I'm learning them, I'm doing it in the privacy of my own home!  The reason why I wouldn't give this DVD five stars is two-fold.  First, the DVD is old, and the video looks a bit dated.  It's not hi-def or anything like that.  Second, I found Deanna McBrearty, beautiful dancer though she is, a bit stiff and overly rehearsed in her intros and closings.  She reminded me of a cheesy cheerleader at times. And what's with those weird elf shoes they were wearing?  Maybe it's a ballet thing.  All in all, I might buy this if it was selling for a few bucks, but not at regular price.",1430438400,,1193,4.3881278538812785

8209970,2,B000TKNWRO,"I watched this once, exercised with it once, and it is regulated to the ""donate"" bin.  This is the ballerina on the nyc ballet workout 1 (or rather one of 4 dancers) so I thought this would be quite a good tape.
I just didn't like it at all.  I found it quite boring, and would never be able to do this dvd on a regular basis.
More cardio if you like that.  I didnt.",1374624000,,366,3.8533333333333335
8209971,4,B000TKNWRO,"This routine was easy to follow on my first viewing.  I find that some workouts are so dancey and poorly cued that I have to repeatedly rewind to get the steps; this wasn't one of those.

A word of caution - the routine starts with stretches on the floor; no warm up to increase body temperature and blood flow to the muscles before stretching them - this approach increases the chances for a pulled muscle.

The workout is not heart-thumping or intense, so I enjoy this routine as a post-training cool down.  It consists of graceful dance steps, interspersed with repetitive, fluid arm raises and leg lifts. The movements stretch and elongate the muscles, which feels wonderful after weight training.  The music has a soothing effect and it is a great way to finish up a training session.

The instructor's use of a teleprompter is a bit obvious, but this is only a slight distraction from her beautiful, graceful moves. She's just so darn lovely and likeable, it doesn't matter.",1361491200,,980,4.735294117647059
8209972,5,B000TKNWRO,"I absolutely loved this workout!  If you are looking for something hard core, this isn't for you.  However, if you are looking for something that will make you work up a sweat, and simply feel good, this is for you!  I am a huge fan of Ellen Barrett videos, and this had a similar feel.  It also had great music!  Aside from songs from Moby and the Eurythimics, there was also a mix of Theme From Canon in D, which I thought was awesome!  The workout starts with stretching and floor barre work that targets the lower body.  The next section is the dance section.  This ends around the 41 minute mark.  I like this, because sometimes I don't have time for a 50 minute workout.  The last 9 minutes consist of ab work and stretching.  You don't have to be a dancer to do this.  It was well-cued and somehow Deanna McBrearty helps you to move in a way that makes you feel like a graceful, beutifl ballerina!  I have hundreds of workout DVDs, and this has earned a spot in my regular rotation!",1360454400,2,989,4.281081081081081
8209973,1,B000TKNWRO,"Had seen a review in the health section of my newspaper and it seemed to combine a lot of factors I was looking for. However, I found there to be no challenge or benefit from any of the movements. Very disappointed.",1353888000,,215,4.2682926829268295
8209974,3,B000TKNWRO,"I found this very enjoyable.  The video is almost an hour long and includes dynamic stretching, ""floor barre,"" low-impact cardio dance movements, and a cool down.  This is definitely a workout for the masses, not just dancers or ballerinas or pilates gurus.  If anything, this disc errs on the side of too much cardio and not enough dance.  The core movements around which the routines are centered are very bouncy and not very balletic.  Also, the hour-long run time hurt more than helped the workout, it could have easily been condensed.",1296777600,5,539,4.8791208791208796
