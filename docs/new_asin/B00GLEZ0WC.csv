8624250,5,B00GLEZ0WC,"I am 60, I grew up and brought up my children without TV. I find the the technical realization amazing. I like the eye movements that keep my attention on the story. I like the story that is at the same time down to earth and heavenly. I bought several copies for the children of my friends.

8624252,5,B00GLEZ0WC,"Finally a great way to teach kids how the unseen world is active and how they can make a difference to change the atmospheres wherever they go! This movie shows how bad ninjas (demons) are dominating an area and how God uses us (and kids!) to overcome evil with love, prayer, and others. Excellent way to visualize and explain the spiritual realm to kids. For even more insight for adults, buy Donna Desilva's book called Atmospheres 101. Wonderful, practical, and easy to apply.
