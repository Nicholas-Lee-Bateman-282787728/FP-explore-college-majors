3144854,4,B0015HZA5C,I am always pleased when I am able to find a well made movie that relies on a good story and acting instead of high priced special effects.  Grindstone Road is one of them.  Fairuza Balk stars as a despairing woman who is agonizing over her feeling of guilt caused by having a quarrel with her 11 year old son immediately preceding a horrible automobile accident that left him in a coma and on life support years ago.  Even though her supportive husband wants to move on with life and forget the son she refuses to do so.  They buy an old house in the country in an attempt to start their life over but find out that the house has a past of its own including the disappearance years ago of an 11 year old boy with the same first name as their comatose son.  Hannah{Balk} begins to have visions and sleepwalking dreams and begins researching old newspaper articles concerning the missing boy.  Is she losing her mind over the guilt over her son or is she really seeing visions of the missing boy?  Is she somehow connected with the disappearance?  Is the former teacher who first appeared when she initially came to look at the house somehow involved?  Are her kindly neighbors who told her about the house and its past somehow not telling her everything?  All are revealed in the fast paced ending.  all in all a very worthwhile way to spend an hour and one half.  P.S. the product description says that the movie is in 4:3 ratio but the copy I bought is in 16:9.,1235952000,11,1463,4.377777777777778

3144857,1,B0015HZA5C,"A young couple moves into an old farmhouse, only to experience a series of strange events. Is the ghost of a missing child reaching out for help from beyond the grave? In capable hands, Grindstone Road (2008), written by Paul Germann and directed by Melanie Orr, had the potential to be an entertaining (if not very original) horror film. Unfortunately, it doesnt even rise to the level of a made-for-TV movie.

Melanie Orr is a script supervisor (oversees a films continuity) who has directed episodes for a number of television shows. Grindstone Road was her sophomore effort. Paul Germann is a sound effects editor who has written a grand total of one film. Grindstone Road must have been so bad he never got another script optioned. It was like he had a weird dream and decided to make a movie out of it.

Somehow they tricked Fairuza Balk into starring in their cliched and mediocre Canadian horror film. Balk appeared in some popular movies in the 90s, including The Craft (1996), American History X (1998), and The Waterboy (1998), then dropped off the publics radar. She always embraced alternative roles, and wears a goth-ish outfit for one scene in this movie, but otherwise plays a conventional housewife. Thats like asking Jackson Pollock to paint an idyllic country cottage. Its just not right.

As bad as Grindstone Road is, at least it has an interesting story. Wracked with guilt over a car accident that left her son Daniel (Felix Pennell) in a deep coma, Hannah (Fairuza Balk) begins having strange experiences in her new home. Her husband, Graham (Greg Bryk), is oblivious and blames the antidepressants she takes to help ease the pain. Their neighbors, an elderly couple named Ted (Walter Learning) and Linda (Joan Gregson), alert them to the possibility their house is haunted.

Hannah discovers a young boy, also named Daniel (Dylan Authors), disappeared while living in the house and may have been abused by his parents. John Dodson (Zachary Bennett), a mysterious man who only Hannah can see, serves as a red herring to deflect attention from the real villains. Since there are only a handful of characters, you can probably guess who they are. It was refreshing to see elderly antagonists, although the religious motivation behind their crimes is eye-rolling.

With a budget of $1.5 million, theres really no excuse for the film to be this bad. Daniels character looks like they slapped flour and black lipstick on his face. There are plenty of examples of decent horror movies with ghosts that look like regular people. They could have used context clues, lighting, or even an interesting costume to indicate he was a ghost, anything but this awful makeup. John Dodson is also a ghost, but goes makeup-free. I guess thats to trick the audience into thinking hes a living, breathing character.

There is one captivating scene in which Hannah struggles to get out of a noose while hanging from the basement rafter. It looks real and it looks like Fairuza Balk did the scene herself.

Filmmakers treat the horror genre as an excuse to make low quality films, and this check-the-box ghost story is no exception. Despite veteran leads (Greg Bryk also appeared in A History of Violence, Shoot Em Up, and a number of TV shows), Grindstone Road is the Halloween equivalent of a Hallmark Channel Christmas story.

3144893,1,B0015HZA5C,"I like a good Horror movie.  This one got fairly good reviews. They lied, or were planted.  The movie sucks.  Very bad acting by unknown actors.  Usually expected. But these people were the bottom of the barrel of Bad actors. The movie plot was very weak. But most annoying, was the overused sound effect of the startling  loud banging of a large steel door, at the end of a long hallway sound, that ALL  these elcheapo Horror movies use anymore, to surprise you, especially after a very quiet scene, where the actors are practically whispering to each other.  Then, you already expect the loud BANG, noise to happen. And it does.  Too often.  I hate movies with no substance, and excessive annoying startling sound effects.  GRINDhouse Road must be a gag title, the Movie Producer chose, because this garbage is rehashed Grind Garbage effects and acting and plot used in all the low budget trash.  It isn't worth a second watching.  The first was annoying enough.",1327708800,,964,4.740963855421687
3144894,4,B0015HZA5C,"This is one of those movies that you read so many negative reviews about that you either don't bother with it, or find a good price and check it out just to see if it's really that bad. I'd seen previews for it and it always caught my eye so I decided to get it and am glad I did.

 A good movie doesn't have to be full of A-listers. And I wish there wasn't some stigma that if it didn't make it to the box office, it must not be very good. Grindstone Road is entertaining, has a good story line, and has just enough twists to keep you guessing. Everything doesn't have to keep you on the edge of your seat from scene one to the end to still be a good solid movie. Grindstone Road holds it's own.

So basically there's a couple, Hannah and Graham. They have a little boy named Daniel who's in a coma from a bad car accident he and Hannah were in. Wrenched with guilt as any mother would be, her and Graham try to put what happened behind them by moving away from the city to try and put the pieces of their lives back together again. Graham seems to have already given up on Daniel ever coming back to them, while Hannah refuses to believe that, or even let it cross her mind. She never gives up hope.

As soon as they move into their farmhouse, strange things start happening that only seem to happen to Hannah. She's hearing things, seeing things, and seems to be getting messages of the paranormal kind that she doesn't quite understand but wants to find out. Graham on the other hand thinks she's just mentally and emotionally lost it. After all, he's not seeing and hearing these things but has tried to be a supportive husband for her ""fragile state"". Bottom line: he doesn't believe her and finds logic in everything she keeps trying to tell him. Whatever he can't find logic in.. then he chalks it up to her not dealing with Daniel and the accident, and thinks she's just losing it.

To say anymore will give away alot of the movie. That's the basic premise and things just take off from there. There's never any dull or boring moments. It was just suspenseful enough to keep you guessing while trying to put the pieces together of why these things were happening. There's clues throughout the movie that finally come together around the last 5-10 minutes, so you're not left dazed and confused with the whole thing. What I really like is this is one of those movies that you can watch again and again and find some clue or something new you missed each time before.

I think it was put together really well and really built up to a great ending. Even at the point where you've figured it all out as far as who's who and what's what, it still peaks your curiosity of wanting to know what's going to happen next. I would highly recommend this movie because it's actually a pretty good movie. It has just enough elements of any good suspense/thriller to hold your interest, while keeping you guessing and waiting for what's going to happen next. It all falls together with great timing... not too predicatable but doesn't leave you in the dark either.

  Rent it or buy it at a good price. I'm glad I bought it and am happy to have added it to my collection.",1303257600,8,3164,4.331081081081081

3379390,1,B0015HZA5C,"I like a good Horror movie.  This one got fairly good reviews. They lied, or were planted.  The movie sucks.  Very bad acting by unknown actors.  Usually expected. But these people were the bottom of the barrel of Bad actors. The movie plot was very weak. But most annoying, was the overused sound effect of the startling  loud banging of a large steel door, at the end of a long hallway sound, that ALL  these elcheapo Horror movies use anymore, to surprise you, especially after a very quiet scene, where the actors are practically whispering to each other.  Then, you already expect the loud BANG, noise to happen. And it does.  Too often.  I hate movies with no substance, and excessive annoying startling sound effects.  GRINDhouse Road must be a gag title, the Movie Producer chose, because this garbage is rehashed Grind Garbage effects and acting and plot used in all the low budget trash.  It isn't worth a second watching.  The first was annoying enough.",1327708800,,964,4.740963855421687
3379391,4,B0015HZA5C,"This is one of those movies that you read so many negative reviews about that you either don't bother with it, or find a good price and check it out just to see if it's really that bad. I'd seen previews for it and it always caught my eye so I decided to get it and am glad I did.

 A good movie doesn't have to be full of A-listers. And I wish there wasn't some stigma that if it didn't make it to the box office, it must not be very good. Grindstone Road is entertaining, has a good story line, and has just enough twists to keep you guessing. Everything doesn't have to keep you on the edge of your seat from scene one to the end to still be a good solid movie. Grindstone Road holds it's own.

So basically there's a couple, Hannah and Graham. They have a little boy named Daniel who's in a coma from a bad car accident he and Hannah were in. Wrenched with guilt as any mother would be, her and Graham try to put what happened behind them by moving away from the city to try and put the pieces of their lives back together again. Graham seems to have already given up on Daniel ever coming back to them, while Hannah refuses to believe that, or even let it cross her mind. She never gives up hope.

As soon as they move into their farmhouse, strange things start happening that only seem to happen to Hannah. She's hearing things, seeing things, and seems to be getting messages of the paranormal kind that she doesn't quite understand but wants to find out. Graham on the other hand thinks she's just mentally and emotionally lost it. After all, he's not seeing and hearing these things but has tried to be a supportive husband for her ""fragile state"". Bottom line: he doesn't believe her and finds logic in everything she keeps trying to tell him. Whatever he can't find logic in.. then he chalks it up to her not dealing with Daniel and the accident, and thinks she's just losing it.

To say anymore will give away alot of the movie. That's the basic premise and things just take off from there. There's never any dull or boring moments. It was just suspenseful enough to keep you guessing while trying to put the pieces together of why these things were happening. There's clues throughout the movie that finally come together around the last 5-10 minutes, so you're not left dazed and confused with the whole thing. What I really like is this is one of those movies that you can watch again and again and find some clue or something new you missed each time before.

I think it was put together really well and really built up to a great ending. Even at the point where you've figured it all out as far as who's who and what's what, it still peaks your curiosity of wanting to know what's going to happen next. I would highly recommend this movie because it's actually a pretty good movie. It has just enough elements of any good suspense/thriller to hold your interest, while keeping you guessing and waiting for what's going to happen next. It all falls together with great timing... not too predicatable but doesn't leave you in the dark either.

  Rent it or buy it at a good price. I'm glad I bought it and am happy to have added it to my collection.",1303257600,8,3164,4.331081081081081

8258462,4,B0015HZA5C,"This film is surprisingly good. I was expecting another low-grade horror flick with bad acting, poor writing and all the other deficiencies usually seen in so many of these free w/Amazon Prime indie horror movies.  Imagine my surprise and delight to have actually come upon one with very decent acting all around, truly interesting storyline, and direction which kept the pace moving near perfectly.  The lead actress is very good.  At the beginning, I didn't think she would shine one way or another--I was just content to see a decent actress for once.  But as the film progressed, I became aware that she was actually very, very good.  I also must praise the old couple, esp. the wife.  They were able to pull off that pivotal scene, which could so easily have turned comedic.  But that cold expression on the old woman's face chilled all humor out of it.

Another thing I liked was that the writing and dialog had a really natural feel to it.  Nobody said or did anything out of character; no bone-headed decisions or exhibitions of cluelessness.  Very refreshing.  There is virtually no gore or sex in this film, which only shows that a good moviemaker does not need to rely on these things to maintain tension or interest.  I can definitely recommend this film and am going to keep an eye out for any others produced by members of the crew responsible for this one.",1524355200,,1371,4.666666666666667

I highly recommend this movie to anyone who believes that a soul cannot cross over until the mystery of his death has delivered him.
