2583557,4,B000FS9FIK,"Having been thrilled by the director's movie ""Twilight Samurai"",

I ordered this film.  By itself, it is good period drama of the

19th century Samurai period...basically the story of an honorable samurai in a dishonorable world.  However, I felt that

the plot and motifs were quite similar to Twilight Samurai. Given the choice of the two films, I would recommend Twilight over this one. I didn't quite get the point of seeing two

very similar movies.",1152748800,35,454,4.907894736842105

The Bushido Code was honestly represented for the first time in the many of the  Samurai films I've seen over the years and I have seen many. The Main Character was intriguing, he truly wanted to follow Honor and Duty, and responsibility, and the cycle of events in how they took place were worth the price of seeing on the big screen..

2583585,5,B000FS9FIK,"I generally read through the reviews of others to see it through their eyes too just before setting down my own perspective.

To say I'm astounded that anyone could see this as anything at all comparable to Tasogare Seibei (Twilight Samurai) is beyond me, but suggests that they would only be viewing it as a Japanese movie with some of lifes difficulties showcased.

They are utterly and completely different stories, the other being one that a couple viewings is all I've been able to give it. Kakushiken, Oninotsume is one of my all time favorites, in particular the moments where the main character shows his resolve to do anything he can, at any peril, for the woman he'll never have. Even given the opportunity to have her close, he rejects her, for as he sees it, his lot in life and for her own good.

Not a common plot point found on any screen, large or small these days - selfless love.

Above all, it's a story about following ones beliefs regardless of the difficulty incurred, and self sacrifice for someone other than oneself. Very Japanese, in a more traditional mode than is generally presented in many of the more bloodied samurai offerings, and yet so true to the actual codes of bushido.
This man was the exemplary samurai.

If you don't like the pacing of this movie, never go to a sumo match, but if you have the ability to enjoy a movie paced for the story and not the special effects and heart-racing action, this movie speaks more eloquently than most of what it can be to be human when we strive to live up to our own ideals.",1357516800,2,1551,4.505338078291815

2583590,5,B000FS9FIK,"I didn't really know what to expect when I ordered this DVD.  I've never watched a Japanese-made film about samurai before, or any Japanese-made film for that matter other than some anime and Godzilla movies.  So, I wasn't sure if I would like this movie, particularly because I would have to read the subtitles.

But I've been interested in, and have practiced, martial arts for a long time, and was interested in seeing some films that might provide a little insight into the mindset of the samurai and their bushido code.  And I wanted to see something that showed a more realistic view of the time period of the samurai than what I understood that Tom Cruise's ""Last Samurai"" offered.

So, after reading the reviews of this film ""The Hidden Blade,"" I decided to give it a try.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  I really liked this film!  It kept me engaged from beginning to end, even with having to read the subtitles!

Many of the reviews have described the plot of the movie, so I won't go through that again.  But I found myself engaged by the lead character, Katagiri, and his various struggles.  He struggled with his family background, he struggled with his friendships, he struggled with his love life, he struggled with his career, and he struggled with the politics of the times.  All the while he seemed to be just trying to do the right things within the context of his cultural environment; trying to maintain his sense of duty and honor in an environment where there was a great sense of ambiguity about such things.

Despite coming from a radically different background than my own, I found Katagiri an easy character to relate to and empathize with; a very real character.  And I think because of this, the Hidden Blade was an easy and enjoyable film for me to watch.

The film was also visually appealling and the other characters were interesting in their own ways. Each of the other characters were dealing with their own realities and problems as they intersected with Katagiri; but often in very different ways than was Katagiri and with very different results.  Katagiri became caught among these various realities and problems through no fault of his own. He navigated his way through them all by following his personal sense of duty and honor, though not necessarily the same sense of duty and honor that others would have for him (thus illustrating various interpretations of the bushido mindset).  His resolution of his part in all of these problems felt satisfying to me in the end.

So, for me, it was the Katagiri character that really made this film work and kept me engaged throughout. I was always wondering how he was going to handle the next difficult situation he was confronted with.

The film was interspersed with heavy drama, agonizing personal situations, a bit of comic relief from time to time, and a  bit of swordplay.  And the film was visually appealing with the period costumes and sets.  There is some action, but the film is not an action flick. There is an enduring romance present, but the film is not really a love story.  It's a period piece, but the story is not dependent upon the period in which it's told.

It's just the story of a man doing the best he can to deal with the problems that life has presented him with in an upstanding and honorable way.  It's a very human film, a very real film, and all in all, it's very engaging and enjoyable.  I'm glad I watched it!",1276819200,5,3430,4.637417218543046
2583591,2,B000FS9FIK,"The jacket of the DVD says ""From the director of the twilight samurai.""

Unfortunately, the plot is too close to twilight for it to seem like much of a different movie.",1276560000,2,168,4.419354838709677
2583592,2,B000FS9FIK,"I'm not saying this is a bad movie, I just can't see rating it so high. Let me start off with a disclaimer: I lived in Japan for 2 1/2 years and I've travelled to other Asian countries. There are many Asian films I like, this just isn't one of them.

First off, there are Samurai in this film, but it really isn't a ""Samurai movie."" The DVD cover is VERY misleading because there is only one ""fight"" that takes place in the movie, between the main character and another Samurai. This is definitely not an action film, but is more of a tale about honor, love, and traditional Samurai ways yielding to Western ways. And in that vein, there really isn't anything special about this film. Yes, I'm sure countless bleeding hearts were excited about the ending, but in real life, it probably would have went something more like ""OH! You aren't a Samurai any more? You aren't a status above me any more? Naw, I'm not interested - but thanks for the offer!""

The story was not bad; it was interesting enough that I wanted to finish watching the film (though I did pause the DVD on multiple occasions). But it was long. It would have been nice had they balanced the drama with some action scenes as well. I kept waiting for something to happen, but not much did. The tale of two lovers who are kept apart by life's circumstances is old, real old - especially in Eastern Asian films, it's a common theme. There's just not enough originality here or an interesting story to make this anything more than a mediocre film.

2583593,5,B000FS9FIK,"In the essence of Kurosawa movies.  The move captures the ideals of the Samurai.  From the director of The Twilight Samurai, here is a movie that shows both the majestic halls of the Daimyo to the fields of the peasants.  It is a tale of love and duty and honor and is written extremely well.  While there is only one sword fight scene, the climax that brings you to that scene and of course the battle is done very well.  You will enjoy this movie.",1258243200,2,449,4.235294117647059
2583594,5,B000FS9FIK,"Yamada Yoji has created the best example of the jidaieki (period film) since Kurosawa.  He has done something unique to Japanese cinema by combining elements of the Ozuesque home drama.  Also, its timeless plot should even appeal to Japanese audiences who flock to Western films. It offers a much needed change.  This film has a very Eastern feel to it, in that the life of a samurai has not been glamourized.  Its protrayed in a realistic way.  The things that the main character, Katagiri Munezo, must endure, make a good case for the argument that perhaps one is better off just being a regular townsperson.
Throughout the film, there a several examples of classic Ozu films.
In the The Hidden Blade, Katagiri is getting older and is not married. Likewise in Ozu's Early Summer, Hara Setsuko, plays a woman past 25 who hasn't married either. Katagiri becomes a lot like Hara Setsuko's character in that both are stubborn and will get married when they want to and if they want to. Katagiri also shares common charateristics with the father figure of Ryu Chishu's various characters in Ozu films. Some of the dialouge between Katagiri and his servant Kie reminded me of similar scenes from Tokyo Story, when Ryu and his wife are talking.
What I like about this film, is the way inwhich, Yamada humanizes his samurai characters through anecdote. There is a very moving and funny scene of a little girl who is afraid of Katagiri because he carries a sword. Katagiri cannot understand why this girl is afraid and when Kie tells him, he laughs and points out that most of the time samurai never draw their swords. The life of the bureaucract. There are other comedic episodes until the plot has to become serious. That's when the best dramatic scenes come out.
The Hidden Blade is a complex story that requires you to bring you full attention to it. The closer you follow the story, the more you will see and understand. Like any great work of literature, you have to be willing to be in the work and invest your complete attention.
Overall, this is a great film that showcases Yamada Yoji as the best new Japanese director, along with my other favorite, Koreeda Hirokazu.",1235174400,9,2170,4.715039577836412
2583595,5,B000FS9FIK,"If you want a true dipection of a great samurai this is it. Japanese or non-Japanese you will watch this one over and over. The Bushido code lives in every scene.

2583598,5,B000FS9FIK,"HIDDEN BLADE (a.k.a. Kakushi Ken Oni No Tsume) is the second chambara film by Yoji Yamada, who is not particularly well-known for his samurai films. However, there aren't too many directors during these modern times that mastered the art of chambara film-making as Yamada has in such a short time. After his award-winning hit; ""Twilight Samurai"", Director Yamada looks poised for more samurai fame. ""Hidden Blade"" has even been nominated for numerous international film awards even in the Academy awards. (This is the second of reviews I will be writing for Yamada's ""Samurai trilogy"")

Munezo Katagiri (Masatoshi Nagase) is a low ranking, unmarried samurai in the Unasaka Clan. He is struggling during the last years of the Edo period with the westernization of Japan's political and military ways. Hazama, an old friend, leaves for Edo to seek his fortune and another friend marries his sister, Munezo is left with his mother and a devoted servant-girl; Kie. (Takako Matsu)
Munezo has hidden feelings for Kie but caste (social status) differences prevent him from pursuing her. Kie eventually marries a merchant while Munezo watches, as his ailing mother is about to pass away along with the age of the samurai.
Years past and Munezo comes across Kie once again; looking sickly and lonely. Apparently she is not living a happy life with her abusive new family and has fallen ill. Munezo works to free Kie from her irresponsible husband and takes her to his home. Meanwhile, Hazama (Yukiyoshi Ozawa) is arrested and returned to their hometown to face treason charges against the clan; Munezo is suspected of collaborating with Hazama in the rebellion.

At first glance, viewers will see similarities between ""Twilight Samurai"" and ""Hidden Blade""; Munezo and Kie's situation in this film closely matches Seibei and Tomoe's issues of social differences. But if you look beyond the obvious similarities, ""Hidden Blade"" has quite a few major differences to its predecessor. This film expresses the reality of corrupt authority figures and the effect of the Western way of military strategy had on the way of the Samurai. ""Twilight Samurai"" inventively focuses on the life of a petty but noble samurai who has a family to support, while this film focuses on the more traditional ideals of chambara legend. Unlike the traditional samurai films with a great swordsman as the hero; Munezo hasn't killed before. His teacher; swordsmaster Toda has abandoned his samurai status to become a farmer and past complications regarding his father forces him to reach a crossroads where he begins to doubt if the ideals he was born to do is fitting for him.

""Hidden Blade"" has one very realistic but intense swordfight near the climax. The duel is filmed in a single shot and is quite magnificent in its own way. The intensity and realism of the duel complements the strong dramatic elements of the film very well. However, even the strong vitality of the sequence may not be enough to satisfy the needs of the action junkie. Yamada seems to have a strong fondness for period drama but believe me, he does it very well. The intricate storytelling is the true strength of the film. The structure and pace is well done that the plot takes a life of its own.

The characters and the performances of the film are once again the key to the film's success. I wasn't really expecting Masatoshi Nagase in the role of a grim samurai, although he did have some practice in the fantasy-chambara flick; GOJOE. I have to say he fits the role very well as with the rest of the supporting cast. Takako Matsu is so refreshing to look at as Kie; the actress has that simple but very warm charisma that compliments her character. MinTanaka even makes a short appearance as Sensei Toda. I was also pleasantly surprised with the performances of Yukiyoshi Ozawa as Hazama and especially Reiko Takashima as his wife. However brief her screentime was, she managed to express the needed emotions, her sad look of dishonor will forever be etched into my memory.

One weakness the film may have is its similarities to ""Twilight Samurai"", one may see it the less powerful of the two. Not so in my opinion; I believe director Yamada actually made the film to stand on its own. With its well-structured plotline, I think the director actually succeeded in filling in the blank spaces not explored in his first film. There is also a touch of well-placed satirical nods that aids in the film's proceedings. The revelation of the secret forbidden technique known as the ""Devil's Claw"" also adds an exclamation point to the film's final act.

All of Yamada's samurai films have the spirit of classic Kurosawa films regarding Duty, Honor, Loyalty and Ideals. The director did well in adding Love and Family in the mix. This is not to say his films are superior, but I rather thought it was a very ingenious move to humanize the samurai legend. Yoji Yamada has mastered the chambara genre and has earned him a spot in the annals of great Japanese film-making.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! [5 Stars]",1197244800,3,5039,4.886549707602339
2583599,4,B000FS9FIK,"This film is beautifully done; it shows the samurai culture and how it is changed by the 'modern' world; guns & artillery vs. the sword, as well as a new order moving in and how it affects the lives of those who live there.  But this is not an action movie; rather, it is contemplative, I'd almost call it a drama.  There aren't fight scenes every 15 minutes, in fact, the main character even remarks at one point that he's never drawn his sword.  Also, the combat that there is is more 'accurate' to reality, rather than being a lot of spinning, jumping, and special effects.  Its a quiet movie, with a good storyline and characters that you can care about.  Very well done.

I only give it 4 stars out of 5 because it can be slow at times; and even for a fan of asian cinema, there are parts that can be difficult to understand.  But overall this does not detract from the elegant tapestry that is this film.  Its definitely worth getting.",1196380800,7,941,4.337142857142857

The Hidden Blade was truly a magical experience. Munezo is a Samurai that empowers the skills of his master to neutralize a political enemy of his lord. The nature of this film is true to history, and will satisfy any history buff.  I am in love with this film.  No words can truly shed light on this work of art.

2583601,4,B000FS9FIK,"i like samurai movies, as well as both japanese and chinese films. the scenery is beautiful, the plot compelling and with some thoughtful reflection. The big ideas are understated and left undeveloped and just hinted at, for the most part. These are the westernization of japan, the demise of the samurai as a warrior caste and the rise of merchants. But most importantly the effect of technological change on long held customs and ideas(how does bushido operate in a merchantilist world?). There is a touch of romance that is uncommon in asian movies, certainly rare in japanese. There is a certain rebellion and deep questioning of tradition on the part of the movie (Yaichiro is basically right, the leadership is corrupt), the killing of the high official is an excellent touch and unexpected (at least on my part). There is little sword play, it is not a young boy's action movie but rather an adult-reflective film. The main point, killing a friend because the powers that be order it, then disillusionment but holding onto the best of tradition-honor, while looking at romantic love is an excellent theme that the movie certainly adds to the ongoing conversation.

The acting is great, the screenplay is excellent and believable.  Director Yamada also had great cinematographers and music.

Since the story for both Twilight Samurai and Hidden Blade were written by the same author and took place in the same part of Japan, one reviewer unfairly indicated the story was a rehash of the first. Definitely, I disagree with this assessment.

I don't want to give anything away. For those that are like me, be sure to have a box of tissues handy when you see this memorable film.  I rented it and was so taken by the film (even watching it twice during the same weekend), that I purchased the DVD immediately from Amazon.",1168819200,56,814,4.586206896551724
2583604,4,B000FS9FIK,"The film ""Hidden Blade"" is a very good film. The character developement in the film is very well done. The films narrative deals with the changes that are taking place in 19th-century Japan. In the beginning of the film, Yaichiro bids farewell to his two comrades, Munezo and Samon, due to the fact that he now has a position within the shogunate in Edo. Kie, a young farm girl serves as the maid for the household where Munezo, his sister and mother live. As time passes, his sister marries his friend Samon, Kie the maid marries into a merchant family; and his mother eventually dies. As a result, he is left alone.

As the drama of the story continues, Munezo learns that Kie has fallen ill, and that the family will not allow him to see her. However, he breaks into the house and rescues her and restores her health. Meanwhile, the friend, Yaichiro, who earlier left for Edo [modern Tokyo] has come back as a disgraced and caged political prisoner. When Yaichiro escapes, Munezo is ordered to show his allegiance and innocence by killing his former friend. However, his friend is a better swordsman than he. When Munezo goes to see his former sensei [a master swordsman] he wishes to learn how to confront his former friend in a duel to the death.

Apparently, the mater swordsman, Toda, gave a secret movement with the sword to Munezo, not Yaichiro. This secret is known as the 'Hidden Blade.'  And whomsoever has mastered it is apparantly invincible in combat. As Toda teaches him the hidden secret, word has spread that Yaichiro has taken refuge in a farm house. It is here that Munezo will attempt to ply his skill in taking down the escaped Yaichiro. The film is more of a drama, with very little samurai type action. This is not a Toshiro Mifune type film [how many are?] however, it does succeed in being a very good drama. Moreover, the cinematography is very beautiful. Recommended. It is slow paced, but nonetheless a very interesting film.",1166313600,7,1954,4.6579710144927535
2583605,5,B000FS9FIK,"Wow! What a delight. I picked ""Hidden Blade""up from the local video store on the way home from work. It was just on a whim, based mainly upon superficialities (the cover art, the interesting title, the intriguing plot summary on the back), but am I ever glad I did.

This movie is an absolute gem, packed with engaging storylines and intricate character development. There isn't a tremendous amount of action, per se, but the few scenes demonstrate excellent technique. I was glued to the set the entire movie and was saddened when the movie came to a close at the end.

Pick this up for a wonderful human story satisfy your nostalgic longing for days of love and honor.",1160352000,21,670,4.621848739495798

2583607,5,B000FS9FIK,"Yoji Yamada's ""Twilight Samurai"" was an extraordinary treat.  Following in similar footsteps, ""The Hidden Blade"" is again a samurai tale where a lower samurai must weigh matters of principle against what is politically and financially advantageous.  Shown at film festivals in Berlin & Newport Beach, the main character is Munezo Katagiri whose sister marries out of the household.  Masatoshi Magase who played so romantically as the second love interest in ""The Sea Is Watching"" does the title role.  He's very sensitive and honest, but a bit out of touch with his own emotional needs.  Takako Matsu who has only made 3 films including 2006's ""Suite Dreams"" plays the housekeeper Kie.  She works hard and lovingly takes care of Katagiri's house.  Matsu's beautiful good looks and expressive face make her a charmer.  Caste issues divide her from the samurai.  When Kie marries, her new family abuses and fails to appreciate her.  This results in her illness and rescue by Katagiri who barges into the household and rescues Kie from her own husband!  Kie is nursed back to health.  Meanwhile Yaichiro Hazama is from the same samurai clan and has gone to the big city of Edo where he gets caught in a plot to overthrow the Emperor.  He's brought back home in a basket and imprisoned, rather than being given the dignity of hari kiri.  The authorities come to Katagiri and give him the charge of dueling with Hazama, who breaks out of prison and holes up in a rural hut.  The lovely Reiko Takashima plays Hazama's wife and comes to barter with the only commodity she has, her body, to try and save her husband's life.  She goes to the Chief in charge (forgot his title) and makes a similar deal when Katagiri refuses her.  Unfortunately, the unscrupulous Chief has no intention of freeing Hazama and fails to inform Katagiri as he has promised Mrs. Hazama he would do.  Min Tanaka who played in ""Twilight Samurai"" is the retired martial arts instructor Toda who gave Katagiri knowledge of a special move called the Devil's Claw.  Now living in a pastoral setting, he gives Katagiri a few last tips.  The duel takes place with Katagiri surviving.  The Chief suffers justice at Katagiri's hands with the lightning fast Devil's Claw dispatching him to the next world.  Deciding to follow Toda's example, Katagiri renounces his pledge as samurai and sweetly approaches Kie who has not remarried and no longer has a caste restriction separating her from the man she obviously loves.  There is a real sweetness and innocence in the story of ""Hidden Blade"" that shows a moral compass.  The performances, direction and cinematography are first-rate.  Bravo!",1156377600,77,2647,4.907657657657658
