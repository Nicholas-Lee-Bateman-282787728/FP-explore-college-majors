960057,1,6304879474,"well this movie was really really boring. it had its scenes oly about 2 however. the acting is bad, the storyline is horrible, the casting is bad,little or know special effects, not scarry, and rather annoying.dont  buy it or rent it stay far away from this hunk of junk",963705600,,270,4.510204081632653
960058,3,6304879474,this movie was really funny through the first hour.the last hour was kinda scary.thats why i can see why this movie got 1 and a half stars.the guy blew a bubble with the condom! and the scene where they're bungee jumping off  the eifel tower really freaked me out because im afraid of heights.see this  film,955324800,,307,4.464285714285714
960059,5,6304879474,"it is a good follow up to an american werewolf in london. It has great computer affects and I really like the fact that there is more than just one werewolf, instead a whole pack of them hunt in secret parties where  they invite only americans. The werewolves don't look as good as they do in  the first one but still scary.",954460800,,324,4.209677419354839
960060,4,6304879474,This movie was very entertaining.  The story line was convincing and it made sense.  The part were we find out that Claude(the bad guy) stole the syrum to transform at any time of the month was very thrilling.  The only  part that I didn't get was at the end.  When Serafine(Julie Delpy) became  human. I thought she was the daughter of the original people so she carried  the bloodline?  Oh well.  But I gave this movie Four stars and two thumbs  up...way up!,950054400,2,460,4.433734939759036
960061,2,6304879474,"The effects are horrible. it's nothing to do with London. Ther werewolves change in a few seconds by comparison to the agonizing and slow transformation in London. The werewolves look almost bald, utterly  ridiculous. It wasn't scary, nor that funny. Don't waste your time. Check  out London, or mayeb the Howling.",949017600,,314,5.137254901960785
960062,5,6304879474,"Hey im looken for a werewolf movie that has alot of blood in it,killing,turning other poeple into werewolfs,watching the poeple turn, and alot of other monsters/demon or vampires that are in the movie too. If  you know a movie that is like that e mail me at grantes@excite.com",948412800,,276,4.75

7882146,3,6304879474,"nothing can surpass London, but Paris is an ok view. not that scary in my eyes but some of them will make you jump if you don't like horror movies. basically its about Evertt and his pals going to Paris, they go on the Eiffel Tower and he stops Delpy from comitting suicide and then she brings him into the world of the werewolf. some great special effects include when Everett is running threw the cemetary transforming and Bush adds some spark with their song Mouth(remix) and in that music video you see shots of the movie",1066348800,,525,4.422680412371134
7882147,1,6304879474,"Anthony Waller took the helm of American Werewolf in Paris on the success of his wildly amazing film ""Mute Witness"".  Everything about ""Mute Witness"" was wonderful.  It was riveting and an edge-of-your-seat thriller.
American Werewolf in Paris is just the opposite.  I wanted to like this film, because I was nuts about Waller's first film.  Here, however, the director, the producer, or the studio - or all three [messed] this film up horribly.  The story-line is pitifully infantile - which Werewolf in London wasn't.  Further the CGI werewolves are so badly created that they look not unlike cartoon characters (similar to Roger Rabbit).
I hope and pray we get better results from Waller again and that his brilliance isn't just lightning in a bottle.
Don't bother!",1059609600,5,768,5.055555555555555
7882148,4,6304879474,"This seems to be a reproduction of the earlier film (""American Werewolf in London"") but with more comedy, and much more special effects using computer generated images. ""Is it real of is it Memorex?"" Some American students / tourists visit Paris to do something wrong, and tumble into a situation that is over their heads. The hero gets the girl, but also gets more than he bargained for. His attempts to get out of his predicament form the basis for this horror film leavened with comedy. All this action could make you overlook the real danger in foreign travel (contracting a fatal disease). All in all, a fun movie to watch (if you are not too critical).
The actions of les loups garous should make ""Buffy"" happy she only has vampires to deal with! Its too bad Abbott & Costello are no longer around to take advantage of today's technology (""Abbot & Costello Meet Jekyll & Hyde"")",1057622400,,883,4.630573248407643
7882149,4,6304879474,"When three fresh out of college guys take a daredevil vacation to Paris, One of the friends see's the girl of his dreams and after a while find out she is not what she seems to be..Even though she is not all human, he still wants her...Imagine That? This movie has great action and Gore...An all around good flick.",1000598400,,314,4.338983050847458
7882150,5,6304879474,"First off, if you expect to see anything about David Kessler and Jack Goodman (The main characters in ""An American Werewolf in London"") don't watch this. It has nothing to do with any of those characters. It is it's own movie and having said that, let me add it's pretty good too. Although the f/x in ""London"" were much better as was the story, this still holds it's own. It has lot's of genuine scares as well as laughs, the f/x were o.k. too (Although Rick Baker should have been called back in.) If you are looking for a movie that doesn't make fun of the whole genre like the ""Howling"" sequels did, you will like this one.  I highly recommend it.",988156800,17,650,4.327868852459017
7882151,2,6304879474,"Although it shares some of the same ideas as AWIL it in no way lives up to the first one. It is too long, too predictable and lacks any real story-line. The acting is terrible and dry and the special effects are lame at best. As for a horror movie I can only say they should have rated it PG-13, its definetly a movie for teenagers not adults. If you liked movies like ""Scream"" and ""I know What You Did Last Summer"", you may actually like this movie. I wouldn't reccomend renting it, watch it when it comes out on t.v.  I love werewolf movies and have seen practically all of them, this ranks as one of the worst. If want a good werewolf movie watch ""The Howling""(my favorite), ""Bad Moon"" is also quite good although it has some flaws, but the werewolf in it is, for lack of a better word, Awsome. As for AWIP all I can say is, LAME.",978307200,3,833,4.1419753086419755
7882152,4,6304879474,"Bear in mind, it would take nothing short of a miracle to surpass the originality and greatness of the original film that this movie is based on.  But as an updated version in an entirely different city it does a pretty good job.  The Werewolf effects were great, the death scenes very graphic and bloody.  It was pretty obvious that the effects were CGI but being a horror movie my disbelief was already pretty much in the stratosphere.  The beautiful French actress, Julie Delpy is great and Tom Everret Scott plays the lead very well.  The only thing that gets me is that it took so damn long for a sequel to An American Werewolf in London and yet there have been several sequels to The Howling, which is just a terrible werewolf film.  There needs to be more American Werewolf movies!  If you're a Horror/gore fan this movie is right up your alley.  Arguing corpses, neo-nazi Werewolves and a great sense of humor make this an enjoyable sequel to the original that's far better than the Howling (if you like The Howling, I'd suggest checking out Howling V: Rebirth, it's a pretty spooky movie with good werewolf effects).  All in all if you loved the first movie you'll at least like the second, so check it out all you little lycanthropes!",971913600,4,1244,4.5675675675675675
