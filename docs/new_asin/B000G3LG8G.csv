Having said that, this is one of the most enjoyable movies of all time for me. I watched it many years ago and years later, I searched everywhere on the internet for a copy and found one (albeit bad quality) and was able to rediscover this gem of a movie once again.

It's such a beautifully acted movie. Really stirs up those emotions in your heart and makes you believe in what the people are going through. The acting by entire cast is genuine and you believe in them.

Highly recommended.",1297555200,,586,4.457943925233645

8128861,5,B000G3LG8G,"This film is one (and maybe few) of Leon's best early roles as a mischief and untrustful son/Hong Kong street punk, Wai.  Wai is given a second chance in life with his lost lover and his gentle father, but faith is not in his side when Wai is framed for murder and wanted by the HK police.  Wai tries everything in his will to reunite with his lost lover for one last chance before he gets captured or runs away.
This is truly a father & son movie: a Romeo and Juliet film.  If you seen it or have it, you'll def. love this film.  The film opens the heart and gives the viewer the hope for Leon Lai's character, Wai.  Most of the cast members also gave a great performance for a low budget movie of that time.  Not no melodrama or chessy in a sense of a typical HK film.  Get it.  Watch it.  Own it if you can!",1159747200,,810,3.981366459627329
8128862,5,B000G3LG8G,"I've been looking for this DVD for a very very long time!

It seems to be out of print everywhere around Asia.

I'd like to know if this DVD comes with Chinese subtitles though?

And what audio tracks does it include? Cantonese or Mandarin?

Thanx for answering!",1156723200,,262,4.51063829787234
8128863,5,B000G3LG8G,"Sometimes the person whom we think that will married is not the person that really whom we should spend our left life to him. We can see it such as when we catch the other hand but we really not feel the other feelings. But sometimes when we unexpectedly meet someone whom is really the opposite site from our social class or behaviour life,maybe this one is really person whom could change our life for ever................
Wu Chien Lien (whom play leading actress in this movie) expresses the role that she played in this movie so well through her face and character,her performance is so natural. She can make audiences believe in the relationship that happened with her and him(the leading character),although this relationship happened between the people whom much different,one citizen.....one criminal.one wealthy......one jobless,one well educated.......one known life in jail much than city's life. Although they are much different,they can changed each other life by their believe in destiny,believe fate and believe in their relationship which their trusted each other. They believe that they can change each other destimy by their fate. A romantic movie that worth for learned to feel in our heart that maybe we also don't know what is the thing that our heart really want along our lifes.",1070323200,,1301,5.112676056338028
