8476692,5,B005KBPT2I,Awesome! I do recommend doing the short tutorial at the beginning but if you don't get all the moves the first time out just keep with it. It definitely gets the heart rate up and has some fun moves. Also the customer service is beyond excellent.,1425427200,,246,4.369565217391305
8476693,5,B005KBPT2I,"Tim Culwell produced 4 step workouts on videotape in the early 90s.  I bought all of them and used them regularly.  I was happy to see that they are all now available on DVD.
Tim is an upbeat and energetic instructor with excellent cuing skills.  Each workout is diverse enough, often with novel combinations of moves, to keep my interest and momentum going to the end of the workout.  They all run approximately an hour and 10 minutes from warm up to cool down and final stretch.  They all include warm up, 3 step segments, cool down, ab work, and stretch.  The dvds are organized in chapter, so one could selectively mix and match chapters if desired.  I always do all the chapters and feel great when I'm done.  I go through phases where one or the other is my favorite, so I'm giving them all the same review.
These are fun workouts that I would rate as intermediate to advanced, but not killer.  You should have at least some step experience to do them.  One of Tim's crew members in the 3 Creative Stepps workouts is Gay Gasper, who herself is an excellent step instructor.
I wish Tim would produce more step workout dvds!",1390694400,2,1128,4.458536585365854
