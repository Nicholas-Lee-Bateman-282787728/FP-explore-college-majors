8399008,4,B003KWWDH8,A fun concert that is well recorded and filmed.  You can see him perform so closely that a few times I had to pick up my instrument and try to play along.  I wish the few comments through it were optional.  If I want to play this as background music those comments become a bother.,1459036800,,281,4.072727272727272
8399009,5,B003KWWDH8,"Anything Bill Frisell is good. I just like his style of guitar playing, I have many of his CDs, so what can I say, I am a big fan of his style.",1444780800,,143,3.5
8399010,4,B003KWWDH8,"I'm tempted to move this up to a 4.5 star rating. I love guitar-playing to the nth degree and Frisell comes through in his varied way - all by his lonesome. (If not for Boubecar, a modern, very discordant piece, I'd gladly give this 5 stars. I skip that one song, though.) I describe him as a jazz guitarist by way of country music. He often plays with an almost gentle, country-ish pace. It's a wonderful blend of multiple kinds of music and yet he's nothing if distinctive. Bravo again Mr. Frisell.",1429142400,,500,4.445652173913044

8399012,5,B003KWWDH8,A swell evening of smoothness. Bill at his best! Some of it is pretty abstract and takes a few listens.,1357862400,,103,4.2
8399013,4,B003KWWDH8,"In this installment of Solos: the Jazz Sessions, Bill Frisell plays seven of his standards. Frisell plays solo electric guitar and uses his arsenal of pedals and effect devices to achieve the atmospheric grandeur that is his signature sound. 'Keep Your Eyes Open,' is a strong and light-hearted opener. Courtesy of the close-up camera work, the home viewer can study how every note is played. 'Throughout' is as loose and open as the cavernous location, Toronto's Berkeley Church. 'Throughout' transitions into a gorgeous retelling of 'Ron Carter.' The beautiful song brings to mind a Frisellian redux of 'Ave Maria.' After a hazy avant-garde intro, 'Boubacar,' emerges as a thought-provoking Desert Blues piece. The Americana body of Frisell's work emerges with 'Shenandoah.' It is a lengthy piece that is packed with musical wanderings to forbidden places. After drifting around in the woods, the candle in the ol' homestead can finally be seen! Lightening the mood, 'Wildwood Flower' is perhaps the most recognizable song on the DVD. Bill Frisell does the Carter Family justice. ""Poem for Eva"" is a beautiful closer that summarizes the charm of a live Bill Frisell performance. The sound quality is excellent and the ecclesiastical background helps to emphasize the musician and his music. The DVD can be played in stereo and 5.1 surround sound. The viewer can choose to 'play all,' which will integrate the songs and short but insightful talks by the artist. Otherwise, the songs and interviews can be watched in separate blocks. The biggest potential mistake for the viewer is to skip the bonus songs. These covers are tons of fun! Bill plays Hank's 'I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry,' Dylan's 'Masters of War,' and Gershwin's 'My Man's Gone Now.'

Since videos of this guitar player are far and few between, ""Solos"" offers a precious look at Bill Frisell.",1317254400,7,2205,5.787692307692308
8399014,5,B003KWWDH8,"I am a Bill Frisell fan and the quality of the music on this production is outstanding. Bill also provides commentary and perspective on his music between songs. However, in my opinion the most telling endorsement I can provide you about this set is how it is received by others. I have exposed this disc to dozens of friends on multiple occasions as we've hosted dinner parties over the years. Everyone, and I mean everyone, asks about the artist and comments on the beauty of the music. This is truly a special collection.",1295136000,4,524,4.645161290322581
