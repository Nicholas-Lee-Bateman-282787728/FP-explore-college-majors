2382844,2,B000A9QKSW,"Honestly i was pretty dissapointed with this season. From the very beginning you can tell the show had sold it's soul. In the first episode Keenen Ivory comes out in an expensive suit and tries to talk seriously to the crowd. Where in the other seasons he would come out in jeans and a t-shirt eager to get the show rolling. It's like they wanted to take this season into the mainstream but they forgot that the comedy is what made it so popular. Sure there are still some good sketches. Carrey's fire marshal bill character is funnier then ever. However there is a serious lack of skits on each episode. The fly girls went from being an intro to and from commercials to having two solid 4-5 minute dance routines. That on top of 10 minute rap acts at the end of the show really cut into the sketch time(Some episodes have only 3 skits on them!). You just don't get the amount of pure comedy that you did with earlier ones. It's like they were trying to fit so much other stuff into the show, they forgot what it was originally all about. The lack of Damon Wayans really hurts this season as he had many of the better characters. If you have all the seasons, obviously pick this up. But if your just getting into this series, get season one or two, preferably both. As they are the golden years of this show.",1130112000,8,1308,4.321138211382114

2382846,2,B000A9QKSW,"Im pissed off.  In living color was my childhood.  in many ways watching this show makes me relive my past.  But i can remeber so much more.  So much more.  Is there a reason, is my memoery playing games with me.  NO.  This is not in living color.  This is In living color with no soul.  The music has been changed into Techno rap that seems just strange.  In living color was known breaking Hip Hop into the mainstream.  But those great songs are gone.  I asked myself the fly girls seem lame. its not the fly girls its the music thier dancing to.  Where are all the music Videos  Shabba ranks Mr Ugly man,, vanillia ice.  Only thing ive seen is Mc hammer.  Why are they palying with us.  i don't care if i have to buy another set just give me those Videos and lost skits.  Please.",1128470400,13,782,4.134228187919463
2382847,5,B000A9QKSW,"I cant wait to see this season even though keenen and Damon Wayans left this season, but Marlon Wayans joins which should still make it pretty funny. And I cant wait to see Jennifer Lopez shaken it fast again like in season three.",1126051200,3,230,4.372093023255814

2382858,1,B000A9QKSW,"Rupert Murdoch & his New Corp that run Twentieth Century Fox are too cheap to pay for the original music bumper songs that were featured with the fly girls. This series was a hit due to the writing headed by Keenan Ivory Wayans. These DVD releases SUCK!!!!. BEWARE NOT ORIGINAL AS IT WAS ON FOX TV 1990-1995!!!!. YOU ARE BETTER OFFER RENTING IT ON NETFLIX OR WATCHING ON YOUTUBE OR CABLE. FOX NEEDS TO GET WITH IT & PAY THE MUSIC LABLES THIER MUSIC FOR THE ORIGINAL BUMBERS AT THE END OF EACH SKETCH. KEENAN LEFT AT SEASON 4 BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT GIVING HIM SYNDICATION PAYOUT ON THE RERUNS!!. 20TH CENTURY FOX DOES NOT LIKE TO PAY ITS MINORITY OR LABELS THAT PRODUCE HIP HOP!!!.************DO NOT PURCHASE*************************BOOTLEG EDIT RIPOFFS!!!!********************** - I LIKE TO SEE JENNIFER LOPEZ, DEIDRE LANG, CARI-ANN INABA, CARRI FRENCH, LISA, ETC. - THE ORIGINAL FLY GIRLS DANCE TO THE REAL HIP HOP MUSIC THAT MADE THIS THE CLASSIC SERIES IT IS!!!.",1397347200,,964,4.848484848484849

2382860,4,B000A9QKSW,This is the season when In Living Started to lose it's magic. The Wayans Bros left in the middle of season and we stil don't have all of the music paradies they did in the 90's!!,1369872000,,178,3.9722222222222223

2382862,5,B000A9QKSW,"I was a fan from day 1 & still find the show funny. The show was a launching pad for many comedy stars including Jim Carrey, the Wayans family & Jamie Foxx! The sketches had many memorable characters that fans grew to love. Jamie Foxx as a real ugly woman will make you wet your pants. Jim Carrey as Fire Marshall Bill still makes me laugh, even though the Fox network took a lot of heat over the playing with fire & was responsible for killing the character. The series was still good in season 4, but was loosing its edge as Damon Wayans was leaving. The show also had good musical groups who were chart toppers at the time & of course there were the Fly Girls who Rosie Perez made famous. Bottom line, buy it if you can find it. It is not easy to find, but so worth it!",1366329600,,772,4.0855263157894735

2382865,1,B000A9QKSW,"I bought the first couple of seasons of ""In Living Color"" before all the others were released. I like the first two, and am hesitant to get the rest because the show went downhill pretty much around the third year. I am VERY disappointed that the show did not do one special dvd specifically for all the music video parodies they did - which were outstanding. Does anybody know if such a dvd will be produced?",1273017600,2,409,4.394736842105263
2382866,5,B000A9QKSW,"I loved the show when it first aired, and I love it just as much now. It's just as funny as I remember it.",1256083200,,106,3.4583333333333335
2382867,4,B000A9QKSW,I loved it. I just wish it would've had the parody Lock You in the Closet by Joe Jackson.,1252022400,,89,3.736842105263158
2382868,1,B000A9QKSW,"Echoing the sentiments of so many reviewers, I am COMPLETELY disappointed.
I bought this season specifically because I have not seen the Vanessa Williams paraody of SAVE THE BEST FOR LAST since it aired back in the fall of 1992.  I was quite excited to finally have it at my access, right!? WRONG!
Despite the fact that they mislead you by posting a pic of Kim Wayans as Vanessa on the DVD cover, that clip is NOWHERE TO BE FOUND on this set.  Neither are any of the other music clips.
The edit makes the set a RIP-OFF
This will be my first and LAST purchase of any of the IN LOVING COLOR dvds.  I am satisfied, from this point, to just watch them in syndication.",1230595200,2,663,4.246031746031746

2382871,1,B000A9QKSW,"The 4th season is terrible.  You can tell that once Keenan and Marlon left, the sketches went down hill.  Most were almost a train wreck with no clear direction.  Don't waste your money on this DVD.",1205452800,2,198,4.444444444444445
2382872,4,B000A9QKSW,"This is where I first 'met' and fell in love with Jamie Foxx.  We used to get this show in NZ and I'd kick everyone out of the room so I could watch it in peace.  I think it started lacking something here and don't find this nearly half as funny as the other seasons.  This is the last season for the Wayons' and I think they got out while the going was somewhat good.

I'd recomend this dvd to fans of the show only; if you are new to ILC, then definately don't start here - go back to the beginning because those first couple of seasons were the absolute best (see my review for season 1).",1141948800,4,591,3.983050847457627
2382873,1,B000A9QKSW,"Don't buy this DVD. They've included some of the exact same sketches already shown on Seasons 1-3 dvds right down to the music performances at the end. On one episode, they showed Another Bad Creation performing. The exact same performance was on Season 2. Just watch it on tv.",1133222400,14,277,4.673469387755102
2382874,1,B000A9QKSW,"This season totally sucks.  Damon Wayans was what really put fire into the show, but he left.  He did make some comebacks on Men On Fitness and Handi Man, which were the classics.  Keenan and Marlon were only on there for half of a season.  This was truly the last season of In Livin' Color because after this, all the Wayans sibilings were gone.  What really made this season suck were cutting off the original sketches that were funny :  The Whitney Houston, Boys II Men, Joe and Latoya Jackson's parody to Michael's ""In the Closet"", The Jackson Bunch, Prince (WHY THEY DO THAT!?), and Michael Jacksons Black & White (BIG BIG MISTAKE!!!!!! - I'M MAD CUZ THAT WAS THE BEST AND FUNNIEST IN LIVING COLOR SKETCH!!!!!!).  Total Ripoff!  They don't edit these sketches when they play them on BET (they are on BET now) so for those that didn't buy this DVD, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF TRASH THAT DOES NOT GIVE YOU THE COMPLETE EPISODES!!!  Just tape them on BET!  I'm really disgusted and I give this DVD a F-!!!!!",1132963200,59,1023,4.451612903225806
2382875,1,B000A9QKSW,"Like I said, the show is good but Fox cut sketches which did parodies of music.  Such as the Brady Bunch theme for a Michael Jackson/Jackson Family Sketch.  And a funny send up of ""Black and White"" in which Jackson sings questioning if he is Black or White to that famous tune.  Disappointing that Fox would do this.  I would think most people would pay extra for the complete shows as they were originally aired.",1132444800,33,413,4.466666666666667
2382876,2,B000A9QKSW,i don't agree with anyone who thinks this season is awesome. most of the skits are only 15 minutes in length. once again cheap fox won't buy the music rights. there is sections (i think) that have been either doctored or just cut out. you'll be watching an episode and you'll see the screen mismatch up for a brief moment. you'll think it's your eyes but it's not. thank you fox for butchering all of the seasons of in living color. even though my review isn't that great i still believe that in living color was and is one of the best sketch comedy series on t.v. so they're all still worth buying.,1130716800,25,599,4.3097345132743365
2382877,3,B000A9QKSW,"Kinda dissappointing after the first 3 seasons. But it's not so much the fault of the Wayans. Fox censors really started cracking down on them and the skits became more homoginized. This was Keenan's brainchild and he could no longer persue his vision of what the show could be. So, he and Damon basically jumped ship to persue bigger and better interests. Kim and Shawn stayed on a while as well as Jim Carrey and David Allen Grier. I think season 4 also had the last new ""Men on...."" with men on fitness, which was a scream. And a new Fire Marshall Bill handling the LA riots. Other than that, and the addition of the newest Fly Girl Lisa, the season is lackluster with no focus and no camaraderie. It's a shame that ""The Man"" had to kill this show.",1130371200,17,751,4.371428571428571
