8606436,5,B00EKPZ0XS,"This movie musical hasn't lost a bit of its sparkle despite its age! Almost 70 years young, ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"" is a delightful romp with dazzling dance sequences and witty repartee that never lags.  I'm not a fan of musicals as a general rule - so many are downright dumb and/or silly - but this is a true golden oldie in every sense of the word.  The songs are a hoot, the production design a reminder of the magic Hollywood used to achieve on a studio backlot, and a reminder of why MGM once reigned supreme for movie musicals.

MGM's Sidney Guilaroff (hairstylist), Walter Plunkett (costume designer) and William Tuttle (makeup) remind us why their names are still remembered today as the finest in their fields.  The film wasn't granted the budget to film on location, and made do with the artificial sets on MGM's backlot.  Yes, it looks fake....but no more so than modern movies with their CG arcade-game-appearances.  Viewers are reminded of what Hollywood's golden era turned out and why these films are still relevant today.  Modern audiences will remember Howard Keel from ""Dallas"" in the 1980s, and Julie Newmar (credited here as Newmeyer) as Catwoman.

""7 Brides for 7 Brothers"" is simply fun.  Well worth adding to your DVD collection as a date night, party night, film study or a late-night tv romp.  LOVED IT!",1489708800,2,1339,4.782608695652174
