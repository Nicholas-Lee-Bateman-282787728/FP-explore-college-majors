8576703,5,B00C2U6HFI,"This is a delightful film. Jane radiates throughout. Although known for her infamous role as bratty Joy Smythe in ""Bright Eyes"", this film shows Jane in a more upbeat, sweet role as Paddy O'Day. Paddy comes to America to join her mother and makes friends with a Russian family on the ship. She is especially close to Tamara, a beautiful Russian girl played by a very young Rita Hayworth, then known as Rita Cansino. When they get to America, Paddy isn't allowed to leave because her mother has passed and the immigration office wants to send her back to Ireland. But our plucky little heroine manages to escape and get to the home where her mother worked as a domestic. Paddy wins the heart of the young man who lives at the house with his aunts. Paddy reconnects with the Tamara and her family, and I won't give away the rest of the plot. But it's a feel-good movie, and I can see why Jane was so popular as the upbeat, scrappy, sweet little heroine during the Depression. Rita Hayworth is a standout, even in this early film of hers; her sensual beauty jumps out of the screen, and I can see why she went on to become a big film star. This is a film that the entire family can enjoy. I hope Fox issues more of Jane's films in the future. She is amazingly talented. Although Shirley Temple was the marquee name, Jane was just as talented as Shirley, IMHO. She sings, dances, and can act up a storm.",1369872000,14,1399,4.363984674329502
