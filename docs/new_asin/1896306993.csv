202315,3,1896306993,i think that if your looking for a love story to watch on a lonely night or just to make you feel like your in love then this is a good movie. but if you are looking for a movie that requires thought or any brain power then this is not a movie for you.,1057017600,4,252,3.6
202316,1,1896306993,"I wasn't expecting high art when I bought this movie but I was at least expecting good acting considering the cast.  This movie was so bad it was funny.  I watched with a friend and we ended up making comments similar to those on Mystery Science Theater just to stay mildly entertained.  The story was lame (to be expected) but the acting was lousy with the exception of Oliver Reed who was pretty good as the bad guy.  All this on top of a truly hokey sound track.  I have seen other movies in this genre, but YIKES this one takes the cake as the worst by far!",1017187200,10,561,4.157407407407407
202317,1,1896306993,"I could not believe that with such a great cast list I could be so totally bored!  There is not a single rectifying statement I can make about this film.  Oliver Reed, Michael York and John Mills - acting greats, all - are totally wasted in this venture into Cartland insipidity.  The dialogue and ""action"" are filled with cliches, and there could not be a flatter relationship than that between Grant and Anthony - not one spark!

202318,4,1896306993,I bought the lady and the highwayman 2 weeks ago because I liked the sound of it.  I have watched it approximately 6 times since. I love the ending.  But there was 1 thing that I think was missing.  What happened after the king came to their rescue?  Did they (Panthia and Lucius) tell him what had been happening or did he just know his friend.  I would also like to know if anyone knows which Cartland book this was from.  I would like to get it and read it.,987638400,,460,4.055555555555555
202319,4,1896306993,"I'll be honest... You'll either like it or hate it!  I happened to really like it.  One thing viewers/readers need to keep in mind is that there were several video and two DVD releases of this movie. I own several releases and depending on which you buy, the picture and sound quality varies. In some cases, the DVD transfers are worse than some VHS releases.  Remember though that this was made in Britain and unfortunately they did not do a good, quality filming. Even when it was shown on television back in the 80s, the picture was lousy.  One release of the film that I found had pretty good sound and picture quality, plus I even saw scenes that I hadn't seen before! If you can get past all that, it's a pretty good story!
Another thing people need to realize about Barbara Cartland stories, as this movie was based on one of her hundreds of books, is that they are ""light romances"". Not heavy, trashy, gothics. I think of them as being more of an adventure that happens to always have a boy-meets-girl (or lady meets Duke) sub-plot.
So you put all that together and you get a pretty good swashbuckler romance.  It's not the greatest, but I've certainly seen worse.  If you're a Hugh Grant fan, this is one of those rare glimpses of him before he made it to Hollywood. It's a serious role and I'm not comparing it to ""Sense and Sensibility""! I laughed out of embarassment at his role as Edward in that film. But here he plays a highwayman who saves a damsel in distress. Lots of famous faces make appearances in this made-for-TV movie, plus there is a lot of sword play, beautiful costumes, and a 'Robin Hood' theme about it. The location filming is wonderful... Lots of English manors and coutryside! Give this one a try! It's well worth it!",981590400,21,1749,4.484276729559748
202320,1,1896306993,"The picture quality is HORRIBLE (and the sound is just as bad)  Blurry, shaky, and the speed is off as well.
The movie itself wasn't much better and Hugh Grant is barely recognizable.  Save your money and let this  one go by.",964051200,6,225,4.309523809523809
202321,5,1896306993,"When I first saw this movie, it was on a TV movie of the week, I believe on a Sunday night.  I did not get in on the names of who was in it, and I wondered who that great looking, gorgeous man was who played Lucias.  Well,  many years later I'm watching another movie with this great looking,  gorgeous man in it and find out his name is Hugh Grant.  The man is a great  actor.
The story is a romance set back in the days of King Charles II of  England.  Hugh Grant was, of course, the hero of the story.  The heroine of  the story, I cannot remember her real name, played Panthea Vine, the damsel  in distress, who is saved by the highwayman (Hugh Grant).  He takes her  back to her home after killing the man who forced her to marry him.  He  knew the way to her home without her telling him.  She later realizes this  must be her cousin Lucias who is suspected of being the legendary  ""Silver Blade"".
This movie has its group of meanies, too.  Emma  Samms is a spoiled, egotistical, but beautiful woman who wants Lucias.  He  turns her down right away, which really ticks her off.  Another meanie is  Oliver Reed who plays Cromwell, a well known buzzard back in that time in  history.
My brother thought he wasn't going to like this movie, but when  he got into it he couldn't leave it.  He jumped right up out of his seat  when he thought the jailers were going to chop of Panthea's head with an  ax.
This is a great movie and everyone who loves romance should get it.  By the way, did I tell you it is based on a Barbara Cartland novel?  The  same Barbara Cartland who has written over 600 romance novels.",963014400,63,1610,4.160130718954249
202322,1,1896306993,"This movie was one huge disappointment from beginning to end.
Firstly, I bought the DVD.  Big mistake.  The transfer was by far the worst I've ever seen and I've watched hundreds of DVDs.  It actually looked worse than what  I can get when taping something off of regular network television using the  EP setting on my VCR.  Not only was the whole thing blurry beyond belief,  several scenes shake like crazy and through the middle of many of the  scenes there were video tracking lines like you'd see on a over used low  grade VHS tape.  Which is what this transfer was probably taken from.  The  low list price might have prepared me for the lack of quality of the menu,  but for it to be of a better image quality than the movie itself was a bit  of a surprise.
Secondly, the movie itself was awful.  I love a good  period piece movie and I really wanted to like this one despite my  misgivings as to where it got it's plot line (although I like an occasional  historical romance book, I'm not a fan of Cartland).  But there was just  nothing to like here.  The story was ridiculous, the dialog was atrocious  and the acting was just plain bad. Something that I'm at a loss to explain  with all the known talent that was in this movie.  I'm sure I can't imagine  what the director must have been doing to get such a lousy end  product.
At first I wanted to give this movie/DVD zero stars, but since I  could only go as low as one star I did manage to find one good thing to  justify that star.  The costumes were wonderful.
Fair warning:  If you're  thinking about seeing this movie solely because you're a fan of Hugh Grant,  you can forget it.  He barely strings 10 words together in two scenes and  two words together in 10 other scenes.  He's just not the major character  in this movie that he's made out to be by the cover of the DVD.",949276800,41,1843,4.271137026239067

I suggest you start with this movie and then seek out the whole series!

The Flame is Love (1979) starring Linda Purl and Timothy Dalton.  The darkest of the series, the hero must save the innocent heroine from the clutches of a satanic cult.

A Hazard of Hearts (1987) starring Helena Bonham Carter and Marcus Gilbert, with superb supporting roles by Diana Rigg, Christopher Plummer, and Stewart Granger.  My favorite of the series, the movie begins with the heroines father playing cards.  He loses everything including her hand in marriage to the villain.  Only the hero challenges the evil man to a final game. Thus he wins the heroines hand  and in the end her heart.

The Lady and The Highwayman (1989) starring Lysette Anthony and Hugh Grant, with Emma Samms as a most beautiful villain.  The most popular, this movie takes place as King Charles II (played by Michael York) reclaims his throne.  The heroine is saved (in more ways than one) by a valiant highwayman.  After much intrigue and gallantry they are saved again to live happily ever after.  Cue music.

A Ghost in Monte Carlo (1990) starring Lysette Anthony and Marcus Gilbert, with Sarah Miles as the scheming aunt.  This romance is set against the wicked revenge plot of the heroines aunt. Dame Cartland reportedly requested Lysette Anthony for this role, as she had the played wide-eyed innocent very well.

A Duel of Hearts (1991) starring Allison Doody and Benedict Taylor, with Michael York as the villainous cousin.  This romance is dark and mysterious with a gothic castle, family secrets and murder.  Not a favorite.",1449446400,7,1859,4.916398713826367

Hugh Grant's bad mullet (so very 80s!) and oddly pitched voice (also likely to be a nod to the heroes of earlier decades, when they had to pitch their voices to be heard on less sophisticated recording technology), the horrible lines delivered with deadpan seriousness, the soft-focus of the leading lady's face when she was mooning over the hero of her dreams... all seemed to be created in homage to Errol Flynn and his compatriots.

202492,3,1896306993,"This clearly went over the heads of the British and Australian critics at the time, as their reviews either show them not taking TV movies seriously or being just plain stupid.  Comparing Grant's hair to Duran Duran?  You know they didn't have hair gel or electric clippers back then, right?  Or not knowing what a Lady of the Queen's Bedchamber was?  Seriously?  A noblewoman getting that is on her way up.  It's a contrast between one woman who catches a break after being nice & genuine, versus a wench who schemes through marriage, seduction, and false accusations.

I liked how the charges are just a slight twist on the real story that gets people screaming ""conspiracy to murder!""  And it's not a remake of `Robin Hood' when in the film they use the term in its general reference, as was the style of the day: `A Robin Hood'.  The standout here is the dialog and fairly amazing performances from some of the smaller parts.  Even the players in the bit parts are trying to make it real.  I will admit it could have used some instances of the lead actually helping to dress the Queen, or something related to her new status... other than attending parties.

It's hard to tell for certain, but the costumes, production design, and lighting is probably very well done.  Same thing for the Michelle Pfeiffer flick also on the disk this came on: Power, Passion, and Murder (actually Great Performances, Tales from the Hollywood Hills: Natica Jackson).  That one looked almost like its style was inspired by David Lynch... similar casting, too.  Both transfers are absolutely abysmal, though.  They appear a transfer, from a transfer, from a broadcast beta tape in its last legs.  Horrible.  In fact, Power Passion Murder also had a weird video camera-like motion quality to it that was either from actually filming it on video (hard to believe considering there's a film within the film shot on film in that one) or the result of rather good PAL to NTSC conversion (it doesn't look like bad old BBC conversions).  PPM was so awful looking I couldn't even watch it, so I skipped to The Lady and the Highwayman/SilverBlade.

Both these, apparently made-for-TV period/costume movies deserve to have their rights owners acquire the original conformed negative (or master interpositive, if there were opticals done, as probably in PPM) and the original stereo downmix master tapes (I doubt the multitracks still exist for a surround transfer) and get these telecined to Bluray.  Now it's just muddy picture and droning muddy sound.  Saying they're ""dated"" is unfair, as I suspect a lot more sweat & heart was put into them than people assume.  If anything's dated, it's someone referencing Duran Duran's hairstyles to criticize a period film.",1285459200,,2738,4.866090712742981
202493,5,1896306993,"I am a HUGE Barbara Cartland fan.  I love her books; I'm awed at the way she was able to weave a tale out of the smallest, and at times little known, historical facts.  So to those who don't care for romance fiction, pass this DVD up.  Fellow fans, make a place for this on your shelf(and ignore the awful, and anachronistic, packaging)...

Based on BC's novel ""Cupid Rides Pillion(aka ""The Secret Heart"")"", ""The Lady and the Highwayman"" is set in Restoration England, just prior and during the reign of Charles II(Michael York).  One of his supporters is the dashing Lucius(Hugh Grant), aka the notorious, heroic highwayman, 'Silver Blade.'  Our heroine is lovely Lady Panthea Vyne(Lysette Anthony), whom a masked Lucius rescues after she is forced to wed(Ian Bannen in a marvelously hissable performance).

When Charles returns to power Lucius continues his undercover support of the king, and Panthea has become a member of the royal court.  Unfortunately, she offends Lady Barbara Castlemaine(Emma Samms), the king's mistress, who, fearing possible competition, schemes to exile or eliminate Panthea.  Further complicating matters, an oily cousin of Panthea's(Christopher Cazenove)seeks Panthea's family estate, and the title and wealth that goes with it...and Panthea's hand in marriage.

This is one of the Lord Lew Grade/Gainsborough Pictures collection of several Barbara Cartland tales, and done with(I think)more respect to BC and her fans than the first non LLG production, ""The Flame Is Love.""  Costumes and sets are sumptuous, and the acting is fine throughout, with no winks to the audience.

I own this on VHS and DVD, and I think the color transfer on the DVD is superior to VHS, which looks a little smeary.

Definitely add this to your collection!",1284422400,3,1765,5.150877192982456

202496,1,1896306993,"I was attracted to the cover because I like period action flicks, especially ones with the promise of swordplay and a bit of romance. I thought 'Hmmm, good cast, should be alright, surely?"" WRONG.

This is without doubt, the dumbest period flick I have ever seen. I can jusify this, because I have made it a practice to watch every film about the three musketeers ever made (including the awful Disney thing with Tim Curry). I guess I should have been warned by Barbara Cartland's name on the cover.

Why it is Dumb: It's the Reformation. The Royalists have won. Hugh Grant's character runs around as a highwayman trying to root out Parliamentarian plots that might unseat King Charles II. HOW?! He's a highwayman. He robs stagecoaches. He's not going to have any idea of what plots are going on. Surely, get a job at court and maybe engage in some espionage?

Anyway, its pretty clear here that Royalist equals GOOD and Parliamentarian equals EVIL. I don't want to pick sides, but I do know that Charles I did bring the whole civil war on himself by being  difficult, and that Charles mark 2 wasn't the perfect monarch either. Not saying they were EVIL mind, just not really GOOD. Cartland clearly views differing political opinions on this subject as the work of cackling cloaked conspiritors, sacrificing virgins in dungeons. Actually, she should have put that in.

OK, so this is supposed to be a romance of the 'sweet' variety, not a genuine look at the reign of Chuck 2. The romance sucks as well. The two leads spend hardly any time on screen together and when they do, it's about as passionless as a brick. Nothing happens between them.

I don't blame the cast (actors gotta eat) but I do blame the writing. It is woefully stupid.

202497,5,1896306993,"This historical romance, based on a Barbara Cartland novel, was originally filmed for British TV; later, copied for VCR tapes and, currently, DVD.  The story itself must be taken lightly for historical accuracy as are all of Cartland's novels.  The costumes, cultural mannerisms, and settings for the Restoration period in England are wonderful.  The acting is exceptionally well done in transporting the viewer back in time.  All these deserve FIVE STARS in my opinion.  The greatest disappointment is that the young Hugh Grant, the hero of the movie, was given so sparingly a part.  Anyone who has read Cartland novels has to wonder since she always gives an abundance of exposure to the hero.  Grant's acting is yet another example of the diversity of roles in which he excels.

Unfortunately, the DVD (Studio - Westlake Ent. Group) which I first purchased was an extremely poor quality copy of the film.  It was so blurred with light blotches and very poor color quality that we could not enjoy the film.  There was even a TV screen roll effect just before the end of the movie!  I returned the DVD to the seller and received a full refund.  I still wanted a valid, good quality DVD of this film if such existed.  There are several different studios now selling their production so I supposed it a matter of finding the studio version that is an actual copy of the film and not one quickly dubbed from a TV screen or old VCR tape.

Recently, I purchased the DVD made by Echo Bridge Ent., the one with modern head shot of an older smiling Hugh Grant.  I am delighted with this ""degitally remastered"" version.

 Yes:  the film quality is terrible.  It has the cinematic stylings of 1971, though it apparently was made in 1989 (by someone with 1971 film equipment).  The music reminded me of classic Hollywood.  In fact, this movie was basically Robin Hood rewritten.  The entire movie, story plot, cinematics and music, all reminded me of the 1930s Robin Hood with Errol Flynn. The only hint that this was an 80's movie was the Middle Ages-meets-middle America mashup mullet sported by Hugh Grant.

I didn't choose this movie because I thought it would be historically accurate, in HD, or that it would tie my shoes and floss my teeth for me.  I chose it because romance stories are supposed to be satisfying, happy fantasy.  And this story is romantic, dashing, happy fantasy.  The End.",1507593600,,1253,4.876777251184834

7801147,4,1896306993,"Pros:
-- A good ol' swashbuckling movie full of sword fighting and horse chases, gorgeous ladies in amazing dresses and gallant men in tights and jackets. A feel good movie where the bad guys all get catch/defeated in their own game and the good guys are victorious.
-- There are closed captions if one wishes

Cons:
-- some things that might need parental guidance: man murders a dog and tries to force a woman's bodice open, several tense situations during fights
-- the video quailty is fuzzy.. more what I'd expect from a poorly copied YouTube video, not an amazon movie

Final thoughts: if fuzzy video bothers you or sappy 30s style romance, skip. If you love oldies and adventure and all things working out for good for the good guys, pick this up for your evening movie!",1491004800,3,777,4.6231884057971016
