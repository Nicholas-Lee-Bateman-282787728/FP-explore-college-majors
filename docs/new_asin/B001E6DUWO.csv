8735865,4,B001E6DUWO,"I was a high school lax goalie 30 years ago and have been coaching youth baseball and soccer for the past seven years.  I am now coaching youth lax for the first time.  I have bought several books and DVDs to prep my first year coaching lacrosse.

Upon viewing this DVD you can see why Dom Starsia is a successful coach.  He's not a smooth talker, but he has a talent for making his thoughts understandable.  There is of course a big difference between understanding and explaining, and Coach Starsia is able to successfully express strategy, player responsibilities and interactions, etc. so that the information can be clearly understood.

As is common with marketing, the DVD title is somewhat misleading.  The DVD has useful portions for youth lacrosse and useful portions for high school/college lacrosse, but is not really a complete guide for any level.

The DVD presentation could be improved by having chapter titles (there are only numbers).  Overall though, I am glad that I purchased the DVD and expect to re-watch it several times.",1270684800,2,1044,4.886363636363637
