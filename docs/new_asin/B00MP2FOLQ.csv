8673537,2,B00MP2FOLQ,"This is a Bible based film, but I wouldn't call it faith based. It takes Isiah 34 as an end time prophecy and places the setting in modern times. It seems there are 36 saints at any given time to prevent the world from falling into darkness. Due to poor planning on the Lord's part 35 are Catholic students who attend the same NYC school. 27 dies in an airplane crash. When the other 9 are toast, Lilith will rule the earth darkness, apparently due to meteor damage.

Detective Joseph (Franky G) has managed to figure this out, thanks to information given to him by a crazed homeless guy. All the characters have Biblical names and are related to their stories as each of the saints are killed according to history.

The film was quite an undertaking, just to Wiki search all those saints and get it right. However like a faith based film, the acting and dialogue wasn't good and the characters were not strong or memorable.

Parental Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity. The ""R"" for violence is questionable as most of the violent actions take place off screen. For instance, we see a person tied up and a fire is lit, but we don't see them burn. Does show some blood.",1416528000,,1168,4.4485981308411215
