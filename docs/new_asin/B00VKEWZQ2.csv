7092429,5,B00VKEWZQ2,"Murdoch Mysteries has its 100th episode in season 8 - quite an accomplishment, especially since all the main characters are played by the same actors since the beginning of the show, back in January of 2008. The 8th season takes place in 1902, and there's a LOT to explore along with the cleverly crafted murder mysteries.

It must be difficult to keep a show fresh for this long, but they manage to do it. A lot of that is due to the incredible characterizations - Constable Crabtree, in particular, lends comic relief that is a joy to watch. Season 8 has 18 episodes, too many to give a detailed synopsis for each. But I want to point out two things for these episodes. First: NEW inventions/attitudes/areas of study that came to be in real life in the early 1900's. And Second: REAL people that appear in the episodes.

Also, as you're watching, figure out which episodes pay homage to famous movies. Lastly, I recommend not skipping the Making Murdoch bonus features on the Blu-Ray/DVD releases. They add to the history behind each episode. Compared to Season 7, though, Season 8's bonus features seem to have more appearances by tourism officials for the towns where episodes were filmed. But, even with that, the bonuses are nice additions to your viewing pleasure.

There are NO SPOILERS in this review, but if you didn't know already, I'll tell you now that they dared to end Episode 18 with a CLIFFHANGER. A serious, what-the-heck cliffhanger and who knows how long we'll have to wait until it's resolved in Season 9.

Season 8 has a total of 792 minutes of mystery watching. The DVD/BluRay sets have English subtitles available. The shows are presented in 16:9 widescreen and 5.1 surround sound.

The bonus features include the 18 Making Murdoch featurettes, plus two more features listed at the end of this review. The bonus features are in stereo, with English subtitles available.

....Episode 1 ""On the Waterfront Part 1"" If you remember, at the end of Season 7, Inspector Brackenried was beaten senseless by two men down on the docks. At the beginning of Season 8, he is still on medical leave after 3 months in the hospital. Season 8 also has a story arc over the 18 episodes regarding the struggle to attain voting rights for women.
MAKING Murdoch (7 minutes)
....Episode 2 ""On the Waterfront Part 2"" REAL: Margaret Haile, 1st woman to run for the assembly in Canada. REAL Clara Brett Martin, 1st female lawyer in all of the British Empire.
MAKING Murdoch (6 minutes)
....Episode 3 ""Glory Days"" Another fun episode.
Crabtree to Bat Masterson: ""You and I are quite alike... We're both lawmen and writers.""
Masterson: ""You consider yourself a lawman, do you? How many men have you killed?""
Crabree: ""Well, I haven't killed any per se, but I've roughed up a good many.""
REAL: George Dixon, a black Canadian champion boxer (though his heyday was before 1902). REAL Bat Masterson, ex-lawman turned sports reporter. Trivia: It was actually a practical joke that gave Masterson the international reputation for killing 26 men. And it's reported that he sold his ""gun that tamed the west"" many times.
MAKING Murdoch (6 minutes)
....Episode 4 ""Holy Matrimony: Murdoch!"" The 100th Episode and it's a rollicking and improbable ride! Lots of fun. Constable Crabtree is the Best Man and entrusted with the ring - is this a recipe for trouble?
NEW: Fugue State, a psychological diagnosis.
MAKING Murdoch (7 minutes) Paul Aitken, producer, says: ""The challenge in bringing them together [to be married] was how to do it in such a way that we didn't over-romanticize it.... Their love of solving crimes... trumps their desire to get married in the traditional way.""
....Episode 5 ""Murdoch Takes Manhatten"" Crime follows Murdoch even on their honeymoon.
REAL: Teddy Roosevelt, US President. REAL: Dr. Perry Doolittle, early auto enthusiast. NEW: Carbon monoxide danger from autos.
MAKING Murdoch (7 minutes) Jonny Harris, who plays Constable Crabtree, has this to say about driving an original 1900s car: ""The best comparison is it's kind of like driving a lawn mover.""
....Episode 6 ""The Murdoch Appreciation Society"" This episode was great fun. Murdoch has fans!
MAKING Murdoch (6 minutes)
....Episode 7 ""What Lies Buried"" Brackenried, about the station's new construction: ""Newfangled flush toilets. The pit was good enough for me.""
NEW: flush toilets. NEW: Bertillon system of facial identification.
MAKING Murdoch (6 minutes) Paul Aitken, producer, says: This was a ""bottle episode. You are basically writing a play. It has to be kind of dense as a play and the mystery has to be embedded in the dialogue"", The whole episode pretty much takes place in Station House 4.
....Episode 8 ""High Voltage"" REAL Thomas Alva Edison (has appeared in Murdoch Mysteries before). REAL Thomas Alva Edison Junior, in real life a disappointment to his cold aloof father. NEW: Magno-Electric Vitalizer, a sham product that in real life was touted by Edison Jr (for pay) with this ad copy: ""To relieve suffering is a Noble achievement. To Prevent it, a mighty Triumph"". NEW: Solid Gold Wizard Fountain Pen. It used Wizard Ink Tablets that Edison Jr sold through his company, Thomas A. Edison Jr. Chemical Company. NEW: Motorized wheel chair. This only appears for a couple seconds - there are records showing the 1st one was made in 1912, though not commercially viable.
MAKING Murdoch (6 minutes) Craig Grant, props master, tells us how 3D printing was used to make a period ""electro-mechanical arm.""
....Episode 9 ""The Keystone Constables"" REAL W.C. Fields, vaudeville performer.
MAKING Murdoch (6 minutes) Al Stencell, vaudeville historian, says: ""There were horrible acts, they called them 'chasers'. These theatres did three or four shows a day and had to empty out the seats for more customers. So they put the chaser on and they'd be a terrible act and people would leave.""
Trivia: By 1902, W.C. Fields was a headliner who traveled the world, not a chaser. But he really did start out as a juggler.
....Episode 10 ""Murdoch and the Temple of Death"" Surely you can guess to what movie this episode pays homage!
MAKING Murdoch (6 minutes)
....Episode 11 ""All That Glitters"" NEW: Ontario Silver Rush.
MAKING Murdoch (6 minutes) Peter Mitchell, producer, tells us that the Silver Rush in Cobalt was huge and ""produced more in value than the Klondike Gold Rush.""
....Episode 12 ""The Devil Wears Whalebone"" I loved the historical detail in this episode.
REAL: Dress Reform Movement, it actually started in the 1850's. I got a kick out of the slogan ""Emancipate Your Waist"" NEW: Women's calisthenics of the period - there are photos showing women doing their exercises dressed in their bloomers and high-necked blouses just like in this episode.
MAKING Murdoch (7 minutes) The actresses in the show actually have to wear corsets for verisimilitude. Hlne Joy, who plays Dr. Ogden admits, ""I wouldn't wish corsets on my worst enemy.""
....Episode 13 ""The Incurables"" This episode is so great. Totally creepy, and as a bonus some of Murdoch's best female bad guys are back - with a vengeance!
NEW: Idea that asylums could treat not just imprison.
MAKING Murdoch (6 minutes) Commenters include:
Anastasia Phillips (plays Charlotte/Maddie/Girly, who first appeared in Episode 305 ""Me, Myself and Murdoch"")
Janet-Laine Green (plays Mrs. Lynd, who first appeared in Episode 403 ""Murdoch in the Corner"")
Emma Campbell (plays Rose Maxwell, who first appeared in Episode 714 ""Friday the 13th, 1901"", the horror-style stuck-on-an-island-with-a-killer episode)
Daiva Zalnieriunas (plays Eva Pearce, totally creeped me out, who's already appeared in Episode 608 ""Murdoch in Ladies Wear"" and Episode 713 ""The Murdoch Sting
....Episode 14 ""Toronto's Girl Problem"" NEW: The Apache weapon.
MAKING Murdoch (7 minutes) Michelle Ricci, writer, says: ""we found the existence of this real girl gang called The Forty Elephants, who operated in ... London for about 200 years.""
Regarding the Apache, Craig Grant, props master, says: ""It's considered one of the worst [in terms of competence] weapons ever made.""
....Episode 15 ""Shipwreck"" This is a strong story, and shows Murdoch at his best. Truth versus the Greater Good?
MAKING Murdoch (7 minutes) Yannick Bisson says: ""It's a little bit of an origin story for Murdoch.""
Trivia: Peter Outerbridge stars as Murdoch's childhood mentor in this episode. You probably know this, but Peter Outerbridge played Detective Murdoch in 3 made-for-TV movies. They predate this ""Murdoch Mysteries"" series and first aired in 2004-05. They have been reissued on DVD:

....Episode 16 ""Crabtreemania""  REAL: Professional ""fake"" wrestling. This was popular mass entertainment then as now.
Poor Constable Crabtree is disgusted when a murder suspect tells him a fight was rigged: ""Lying in one thing. Attacking the integrity of the great sport of wrestling - that is quite another.""
MAKING Murdoch (7 minutes) Commenters include R J Skinner (plays ""The Gladiator) and Rueben Jarvis (plays ""Handsome Randolph Henderson) who are professional wrestlers in real life.
Jonny Harris jokes: ""I think if I hit the gym hard I would be ready for a career in wrestling in... four or five years? Who am I kidding?!""
....Episode 17 ""Election Day"" Constable Crabtree appears about to become Detective Crabtree - but the promotion would mean moving to Station House No 3.
REAL: There really were a Dr. Nesbitt and Mr. Marter who participated in politics in 1902.
MAKING Murdoch (6 minutes) Peter Keleghan (plays recurring spy-master Terrence Meyers), admits: ""What I always tried to do is channel James Bond.""
....Episode 18 ""Artful Detective"" NEW: Electroshock weapon - an early Taser. Who says a Murdoch somewhere didn't invent one in 1902? The real ones weren't commercialized until 1969. REAL: Bayesian Theory of probability and Galton's regression formula (would I kid you?). And a CLIFFHANGER to be resolved in Season 9.
MAKING Murdoch (6 minutes)

EXTRA Bonus Features:
....""Behind-the-Scenes Photo Gallery"" (2 minutes) Photos from rehearsals for the 8th season.
....""Celebrating 100 Episodes"" (8 minutes) Much of this featurette is cast, crew and fans telling us their favorite moments in ""Murdoch Mysteries"". For Yannick Bisson, who doesn't just act, but has directed and produced episodes, he remembers the end of the very first episode, 101 ""Power"", when Tesla sends him this message, which reminded Bisson of their hopes for the future of the series itself:
""We are men of the future, Detective Murdoch.
And what a future it shall be.""

If you, by any chance, missed the previous season, that was a lot of fun, also. Again, 18 episodes - a lot of mysteries!

The question that I have is that Julia is so well off while Murdock is just a lowly paid ""detective"", how will they handle the financial problems.  Will Murdoch move into the mansion; will she be satisfied to donate her wealth to the hospital or will Murdoch's pride create a problem.

7092435,3,B00VKEWZQ2,"We enjoy the Canadian Murdoch series.  It is well filmed and the historical details brought in are fantastic.  I don't care for the political correctness innuendos they slip in and wish they would stick to solving murders without trying to brain wash us into thinking wrong is right and right is wrong dealing with abortion, LGTB, family, working women of that era, ect.  Wish they would get married or quit all the illicit sex.  Personally I wish Murdoch would move on to some woman that has his own values, religion, respect of men, respect of differing roles, and a woman that wants to be a mother to their children/family instead of the feminist Julia.  She does not deserve Murdoch as a boyfriend or husband.  Besides these few points I like the show.",1431820800,27,756,4.6893939393939394

7092441,3,B00VKEWZQ2,"Up till this season, Murdoch Mysteries has been a 5 star show.  The characters are all brilliant, and the writing excellent.  But then the stupid writers had to go and throw the ""politically correct"" ( another word for morally decrepit) theme of lesbianism into the show, which totally ruined the last few episodes.  This was very disappointing, and I just hope they kill off Emily rather than continue to ruin what was a good family show.  Yannick B gets 10 stars for his acting.

I started watching this series a few weeks ago upon the recommendation of my young daughter (we love BBC) and now I cannot stop watching.  I have left work early, stayed up late to see if Murdoch and Julie get together, the up and coming forensic ideals, Inspector Brackenreid (love that man); young woman doctor dump Crabtree and now another woman has dumped him?  It's midnight and I have to go to bed in order to get up early for work.  May be I can stay up another hour.  I just can stopped, already re-watching from season 1 to see if I missed anything and going to order the books from the author of this series.

7092527,5,B00VKEWZQ2,"Murdoch Mysteries gets better every season. So happy I discovered this wonderful show. The season starts with challenges for Inspector Brackenheid and ends with a cliffhanger for George Crabtree (Williams loyal sidekick). The long awaited wedding of William and Julia was far from conventional with the two discussing a murder case on the altar and wanting to go solve it before the I DO's. Inspector Brackenreid ordering them to complete the marriage was hilarious. Julia had been meeting with the priest to further understand Williams strong religious beliefs. He was very pleasantly surprised and glowing when Julia stated she wanted to marry all of him. The honeymoon ""Murdoch Takes Manhattan"" was comical.

Yannick Bisson, is such a handsome, intelligent, innovative super sleuth. Helene Joy, beautiful, his equal in every way. The two can solve any mystery. What a team!!  Murdoch uses methods of detection that were unusual at the time. Including fingerprinting (referred to as ""finger marks"" in the series), blood testing, surveillance, and trace evidence.
Real history is an important element in most episodes. It's fun to see how they work historical figures into the storylines. ""Murdoch Mysteries"" tackles controversial subjects...Infidelity, sexual orientation, corruption with grace.  Murdoch uses no profanity. There is no graphic sex. Quality writing, excellent acting, engaging characters...science and whit who could ask for more.",1493337600,,1448,5.602739726027397
7092528,1,B00VKEWZQ2,"Loved seasons 1-7!!! Purchased season 8 through Acorn and was pretty happy until episode 14 when once again, producers have to make a stand for ""alternate lifestyles""! I am so sick of being dissensitized to promote the gay and lesbian lifestyle. Murdoch WAS our favorite show until now. We cannot watch a show that steps all over family and moral values.",1492387200,3,354,4.819672131147541

7092531,2,B00VKEWZQ2,"The first 6 or 7 seasons were amazing.  Five stars consistently.  Clever, fun, full of surprises, innovative, light-hearted, and engaging.  Pure creativity and rich entertainment.  Interpersonal dynamics at the max.  Great mysteries.  What happened to Season 8?  So dark.  Social issues? - almost no intriguing mysteries.  Toil and trouble, problems and conflicts.  Strange story lines and contentious direction (and writing).  The characters are now (Season 8) like they came from a different series.  Dr. Ogden's 'growth'? has been backward (over the past few seasons) - demoted from a highly respected pathologist (a Medical Examiner, no less), to a nebulous, pointless shrink, to a protester.  Almost nothing she says is endearing - or interesting.  Generally combative, it seems.  Murdoch is floundering.  Brackenreid is being transformed into a psychotic, brutish bore - with no foundation for the change.  George has been such a phenomenal character in the early seasons adding humor, spark, levity.  Now he is dragged from one crisis to another; unwillingly, it appears.  What happened?  I am still hopeful for Season 9!",1490659200,7,1128,5.4476744186046515

7092534,5,B00VKEWZQ2,"As an American, I marvel at the show's accurate portrayal of history (tho at times, I think liberties are taken with famous personalities, just for the fun of it).  The relationships beween characters have continued to grow year after year,, and each season the dynamics set forth cause a willing suspension of disbelief, and are totally entertaining.

The first 7 seasons were excellent, whereas Season 8 is much less interesting due to what I feel was unnecessary added violence and the tiresome promotion of the LBGT agenda which seems to afflict every movie and TV series over the last few years.  I take the novel approach that I watch movies/TV shows to be entertained, not preached to about societal issues.  I feel Murdoch Mysteries went seriously off the rails in Season 8 and became much less fun - too bad because the previous seasons were, by and large, good fun.",1482883200,6,606,4.4818181818181815

Especially, in Season 8 the Women's Suffrage Movement is introduced--my dander flares just watching it, as I cheer on the brave women and cure the chauvinists.
The digital quality on some episodes are deplorable (something you would expect on a VHS). If this were a show from the 70s or even 80s, I could understand the lack of a crisp picture.",1481068800,4,471,4.7560975609756095

The series continues to involve characters of the past which is interesting enough. They did booboo when they portrayed Bat Masterson. He was carrying his revolver in a cross draw fashion, a little over exaggerated, which was correct but Bat had a limp from being shot in the hip which the character did not employ.

This series is set in the late 1800's and early 1900's in Toronto and I have generally enjoyed era show.  It seems like Murdoch comes up with a new invention, night-vision glasses, digital photos, fingermarks every few weeks.  George, his right-hand constable, always have visions of the future like paint-by-numerical-order, facsimiles, computers, etc.  It is quite an enjoyable show with mysteries to be solved and quite a few good laughs along the way.",1458172800,,617,5.191919191919192

It takes place in turn of the century Toronto, has a slew of historic characters in it, and interesting to me is that Toronto at that time was anti-Catholic. Now I know why my Irish-Canadian ancestors moved south to Minnesota.

It had the occasional progressive leaning that I could chalk up to historical accuracy and I could overlook it however season eight has gone too far for me! Even the lighting and ambiance of the settings are darker, I remember the other seasons being brighter and more cheerful with lots of sunny days when shot outside. If they don't get back to the formula that made the show I don't forsee a season ten. Sorry I purchases this season!",1456358400,4,529,4.408163265306122

It's unusual to see a character playing the role of a  detective who uses science and his own invention to come up with solutions.  It is especially rare to find one in the era of the turn of last century.

include great characters with interactions with one another which draw you into the plots... If you enjoy

7092827,5,B00VKEWZQ2,This is one of the best TV series we've ever seen. We waited with anticipation for the latest season to be available and binge watched the entire season 8 over the weekend. Do yourself a favor and watch from season 1 and see how the characters develop. Too bad US tv doesn't have quality shows like this.,1446076800,,304,4.350877192982456

Great actors as well.,1445904000,,250,4.340425531914893
7092832,5,B00VKEWZQ2,"In my opinion the best tv show around at the moment - great actors, great characters, great writing, great production - mystery, drama, suspense, comedy, action, romance, what more could you possibly want?! There's something for everyone with this show and even after 8 seasons it never fails to disappoint, always delivering fantastic episodes that will keep you hooked from beginning to end! If you haven't seen it then give it a go, if you have seen it then buy the dvd and watch it again and again!!
Set in Victorian/Edwardian Toronto following the life of Detective William Murdoch (Yannick Bisson), Dr. Julia Ogden (Helene Joy), Constable George Crabtree (Jonny Harris), Inspector Thomas Brackenreid (Thomas Craig) and Dr. Emily Grace (Georgina Reilly), along with other lovable minor characters!",1445904000,,802,5.2734375
7092833,5,B00VKEWZQ2,The usual 'Murdoch' high standard of entertainment. Thank you.,1445904000,,62,6.0
7092834,5,B00VKEWZQ2,Great show,1445817600,,10,4.5
7092835,1,B00VKEWZQ2,"The show is losing its appeal to me.  Characters are being twisted to meet political expectations ie Dr Grace just had to be turned into a lesbian.  Her budding relationship with George was so fun to watch.  I wanted to see how the writers would overcome their little problem.  I was happy to see that Dr Ogden's floozy bleached hair was brought back to a beautiful color and that she accepted being married in Catholic Church.  That was lovely of her.  But now I am afraid to see any more episodes as I watched for my kind of entertainment (which is much more morally based than political).  Am tired of progressive snooties looking down their confused noses.  But, don't worry, I already know how to change the channel and am now enjoying Death in Paradise - great mysteries!!!",1445817600,16,779,4.594202898550725

7092842,5,B00VKEWZQ2,Amazon does no favor offering these seasons for the price they ask . We love the characters and the series but for the price they ask for just one  season on Amazon  you can buy Netflix streaming for three months and watch all seasons one thru 7 and all else they offer for the same price. The savings watching this series on Netflix and not Amazon is major. I wish I would have known but I didn't and well I feel taken and well I used to just trust Amazon for best pricing but never again... you need to shop around and this is a fun show with very likeable characters so please give it a try. Its semi light weight drama but the stories are complete and well written. The production values are lower but the quirky Canadian setting works for this mystery drama! Just don't buy it on Amazon. I wish I didn't!,1445644800,,809,4.212903225806452
7092843,5,B00VKEWZQ2,We purchased this solely because Netflicks has the first seven seasons but not the 8th. If you like Murdoch Mysteries and it isn't available on TV then you NEED Season 8.,1445644800,,170,4.516129032258065

7092858,5,B00VKEWZQ2,"Great series! Very interesting setting--Toronto in the late 1800's through early 1900's. Fascinating, feisty, clever, cantankerous and funny characters. The stories are engrossing and complex--some involve historically well-known scientists, inventors, authors, etc. This program is currently filming it's 9th season--we watched all eight seasons that were available.

7092870,4,B00VKEWZQ2,"Entertaining, but not nearly as good a season as the first 6.  Writers of long lived series always get sidetracked into bizarre scenarios instead of just sticking with the basics that made the series great to begin with.  The more the characterizations take over the story, the more it feels like some syrupy soap opera and less like a good mystery.  There are still a few good episodes, but the series is definitely looking tarnished.",1444521600,,435,4.773333333333333

7092917,3,B00VKEWZQ2,"With seven perfect seasons behind Murdock, I waited for season eight with eager anticipation.  I was terribly disappointed while viewing the majority of the latest adventures of our favorite Canadian detective. The episodes were slightly boring (even the long awaited wedding show which was vaguely amusing) was lackluster. It wasn't until nearing the end of the season that things got moderately interesting.  The cliff-hanger involving George Crabtree was the only saving grace about the year.  I, of course, look forward to season nine  and will purchase it as soon as it's available, I'm sure it will live up to the previous great past years and we'll just let season eight fade away in memory.",1442188800,12,698,5.0964912280701755

7092941,4,B00VKEWZQ2,"I always enjoy Murdoch, as do my 10 and 12 years great-grandchildren. I especailly liked the earlier ones (we have every one of the whole series) that focused on the scientific and technological advances of the time and incorporated them into the mysteries. These children are very smart and big fans of mysteries and it was easy for them to understand these videos. Season 8 was just as good with the mysteries, and some of the social issues of the time (suffragettes) were also interesting. However, I am getting tired of having to see at least one gay or lesbian actor in every media event of late. I have friends and relatives who are lesbians, but I am tired of having it become a central focus of these videos, especially where it involves a character with no previous indication that this might occur and to whom my great-grandchildren have established an attachment. I am beginning to feel like LGBT is being ""forced"" on our society. I will continue to purchase Murdoch for another series, but if this continues to be a major focus, I will stop. I enjoy watching these with my great-grandchildren and this is NOT what I want to see or to share with my great grandchildren. .",1441670400,9,1182,4.633333333333334

7092950,5,B00VKEWZQ2,"As with the previous seasons, I quite enjoy this  ""little entertainment treasure"". This procedural show takes place in Toronto, Canada in the late 1800's and proceeds forward with each ongoing season.

In the first few seasons, each character is snug in their prospective character roles. Detective William Murdoch is a detective (handsome to boot!), yet more; he is a man of various sciences as well, general knowledge of cosmology, the arts, literature, poetry and some others, and keeps fit through his investigations, riding his bike, within limits, of the station house. His character is one of discipline, calmness, fairness, humility-a man of faith (Catholic, yet the tones of it in the character are subdued except for his outward religious sign of the cross at each visited death, horror or situation shock) who aims to find the truth in his cases and in his personal life,(a very reliable man) and only occasionally shows a more secular, human weak side (as a man will). He falls very quickly for the station pathologist, Dr. Julia Ogden, who as a professional, is bright and knows herself, who speaks her mind and is a bit of a ""progressive"" woman, which Murdoch respects. In some of the earlier seasons and episodes, his ""lighter"" side gets a chance to ""expose"" itself. Murdoch takes a little time getting to know her, whether from his shyness, insecurity, or inexperience, which keeps him from moving in, to get to know her more personally. They both have past secrets which become known soon after they finally get together. Just at the point Murdoch is about to propose though, her secrets take her away as she says she can't (the first time) marry him, that she must leave, as he watches her get on a train heading north, box open, devastation in his entire face and being. He almost finds another interest, but that doesn't work out. She returns but is married, a second devastation for Murdoch, who tries to move on, but can't (so he  also has a bit of an emotional mind, too). What entails with her husband and events in her life over the next 4-5 seasons are very interesting indeed! for them both.
Constable Crabtree is hilarious, leaning toward a sensational, easily deceived belief in supernatural and earthly phenomenon. Through working with Murdoch, however, his character, eagerly listens to the respected logic of Murdoch and slowly begins to understand the limits of his own understanding about life and himself, yet sometimes reluctantly, must fight his desire of it. He starts to write down the details of all he experiences on the job and in life and eventually writes a sensational book and becomes an author, though his success is moderate. He is fascinated by people, life and particularly unexpected and unusual situations and people. He is of an easy temperament, friendly, gentle, aware, of much of what goes on around him, though he can be easily distracted and of the prevailing social mores.
Although he is assigned to Detective Murdoch, who saw little of Crabtree's other side, (being still young on the job) begins to recognize some of the Constable's sharpness, as his mind is challenged, and expands, grows, and matures, of which Murdoch finds himself more reliant on him for his perceptions, abilities and strengths (perhaps, might even remind him of his earlier years) as Crabtree helps Murdoch to success on some harder cases. Crabtree is a go-getter.
And of course, then there is Inspector Brackenreid (Irish, English, Scottish?) who is brash, a bit loud, quick in expectation and fast results, of everyone in Station House #4, a grazer of information beyond his immediate understanding, a team player, testosterone activated, likes his drink, and likes a bit of fun, whether patriotically or personally, from time to time, as he is motivated. He is somewhat generally interested in what ""science"" that Murdoch offers him, but the bottom line, are results, which must always prevail, rememberjng that he must produce results for the higher ups. In following seasons, they will all face the reality of their jobs, positions and the unexpected of life, in particular, Brackenreid, who naively believes no one would ever hurt him, everyone knows him and his fisticuffs, that he can handle himself, a touch copper.

I feel that every season has had several exciting or unusual themes, plot, (and especially the story of Det. Murdoch and Dr. Julia), which continue to, although I don't think seasons 6-8 are quite the same, although there is finally a love interest for Crabtree, but a twist. Det Murdoch finds his heart finally healing as his fortune changes, quite unexpectedly (or perhaps not). It seems to me the writing power is still good, but slower, but then that's just my reaction. Could this have anything to do with Yannock Bison becoming an executive?
I am in the middle of Season 8 and look forward to see what else might be in the writing for hopefully, following seasons and episodes.",1441411200,4,4943,4.951807228915663

7092964,2,B00VKEWZQ2,"We have enjoyed the Artful Detective and have bought all the DVDs of Murdoch Mysteries through season 7.  We bought #8 looking forward to more good family entertainment and have been greatly disappointed.  Most importantly, is the change in character of Dr. Grace to a HOMOSEXUAL.
Also the big social pursuit for womens' rights which was brought out once but not a continuing theme.  We don't need comments about society.
The earlier Murdoch had him and his team as detectives, pursuers of truth, etc.  Now they have moved on and in our opinion not for the better.
You should never have let George and Emily breakup.  Now Dr. Grace has no real part in the ""family"" because she doesn't have George.
If you have any more HOMOSEXUAL programing, We will be GONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  They have changed their focus.",1441152000,7,806,4.846715328467154

This season matches the quality of previous seasons. Writing, acting and photography remain at consistently high levels, but the visuals are a bit more realistic. Most of the previous Murdock Mysteries were shot in warm and sunny weather in pristine environments. I was glad to see some new episodes that were a bit darker and grittier, with dirty snow and seedier neighborhoods.

It's no spoiler that Murdock FINALLY gets married. Honesty, my main reaction was a loud, heartfelt ""it's about freakin' time!"" Fun episode that should have occurred a season or two ago.

Also, George Crabtree plays a major role in season 8, which leaves you with the usual season-ending cliffhanger.",1441065600,4,854,4.958041958041958

The Murdoch we had known has become a fly through the air to catch your man, gun slinging, fist fighting police man.  He and Julia have decided to be a modern day couple and live in a hotel rather than have a home, at least they had the sense to marry.  Also, there is way too much homosexual content for my liking.  Our dear Dr. Grace has chosen to become a lesbian and we had to watch her sudden and unexpected kissing of a woman who we thought was her friend.  There is also a male homosexual situation involving the chief of police with young boys of the street.  Honestly it all turned my stomach.  I am sorry I purchased this season and chose to deposit it in my trash can where this type of content belongs.  So if you feel as we do, be forewarned.",1440460800,29,904,4.155172413793103

Some of the episodes are a bit weak maybe even cheesy but the series overall is great and seeks to incorporate some whispers of actual history in the stories. Season 8 is no different but some of the cultural content character lines seemed forced and gratuitous. I will overlook that provided the other storylines remain good.,1439942400,,471,4.619047619047619

7093010,5,B00VKEWZQ2,"I didn't know about the Murdoch Mysteries (aka The Artful Detective) until I saw one when I was channel surfing and found a repeat of one from Season 5. I was hooked and told my partner, but he didn't seem to interested. Anyway, from then on I set my DVR for series recording and practically had to force him to watch one with me. That did it - he was hooked! We saw every episode of Season 8 plus the repeats from prior seasons.  On a whim I checked to see if they were available on DVD and, sure enough, they were. I purchased Seasons 1 through 7, and found I could pre-order Season 8 - so, of course, I did. For anyone who likes intelligent mysteries this entire series will please them. The series is set in Toronto, Canada in the late 1800s. You get to know the characters, their back stories, their lives. Well-known people appear, too - like Tesla, Edison, Conan Doyle...  If you're already an Artful Detective fan (the title used on TV), I don't need to say any more. If you've never seen any of the episodes then this is a good place to start as Season 8 holds a very big surprise at the end and it would greatly surprise me if it didn't make you curious enough to order more seasons.",1439596800,2,1193,4.228070175438597

7093014,5,B00VKEWZQ2,"Never  a disappointment with the story line in this season.  As usual some quirks of humor among the serious of the story line.  Good to see Murdoch and the good doctor finally wed.  Surprises coming in each episode, plus a cliff hanger in the last  At lease I believe so.

7093016,5,B00VKEWZQ2,"This is an entertaining, clever detective series.  I have really enjoyed the entire series from season one.  Over time, the series has managed to maintain its freshness, and the writing is as good as ever.  I like too that this is free of the gratuitous violence, sex and seediness that pervades so many detective shows opting instead for a more family oriented format.  The plot lines are predictable however, and if you enjoy complicated mysteries, this is probably not for you.  This show instead weaves a mystery with humor and human interest, along with a little science.  It occasionally brushes with improbable historical context, but this is done in such an entertaining way it makes it more enjoyable.  ""Murdoch Mysteries"" is what I think television should be.",1439510400,,769,5.0078740157480315

7093018,3,B00VKEWZQ2,"After waiting for a long time to see the next edition of Murdoch Mysteries, I was very disappointed.  The wedding of William and Julia was so fast, if you blinked you would have missed it as he had to go and solve a murder along with his bride in her bridal dress.  The first two-parter was about the waterfront and the Toronto Constabulary and was repetitive and unbelievable that anyone in the police came out without being badly wounded.  The honeymoon ""Murdoch Takes Manhattan"" had so many excess plots that were never cleared up, even in the end.  This show has become like a soap  opera of old instead of the fresh, vibrant show it used to be.

The episode with Thomas Edison's son was pretty good as it had the premise of bringing back for us to see heroes of old which is always entertaining.

The last episode, which is a cliffhanger, has all the remnants of the old William and Julia romance tied in and mystery buffs, I am sure will guess the outcome instead of waiting for Season 9.  On the whole, it was very disappointing to me, although the actors and actresses do a fine job with what scripts they have.  Yannick Bisson's direction of episodes are exciting and he does a fine job as a director.  Helene Joy is lovely as Julia and Georgina Reilly is very convincing also and very pretty..  The making of featurettes for each episode was very nicely done and interesting to a truly committed fan like myself.  Also, Peter Outerbridge, the William Murdock of mysteries before this show, was nice to see again.  He made you feel the nostalgia when Murdoch Mysteries were what they were in the beginning of this series. Thomas Craig and Jonny Harris are very good too, but the character of George has taken a detour.  I hope the next season will be better and re-invigorate my fondness for this series.",1439510400,5,1813,4.538461538461538

This season you also see the return of some old ""villains"".  (Of course they left season 8 with another cliffhanger.)  There are 18 shows on this set. There ARE English subtitles for the hearing impaired. The extras including the ""Making of Murdoch"" of each episode, which I found to be interesting.  Very well done show and entertaining.

7093026,5,B00VKEWZQ2,"Can we really be seeing episode 100 of this delightful series? Hard to believe because every season goes so quickly, and this one is no exception. The tongue-in-cheek discoveries of things we take for granted in crime-solving--a taser!--and life (a flushable toilet?) are great fun to see coming to life. This season has some fun ""guest appearances"" including W.C. Fields and Teddy Roosevelt, but the actor whose appearance is a sly wink to diehard Murdoch fans is that of the talented Peter Outerbridge, who portrayed Murdoch in the movie that predates the tv series. This time round, we hear wedding bells, we see a fun episode that's a tribute to the Indiana Jones films, and the women's suffrage movement gains momentum. Season 8 wraps with a cliffhanger that will have you reach for the remote, pause, replay button, and then feel you cannot wait for Season 9 so we find out what happens.

I've been looking forward to seeing Season 8 for months, and now my enjoyment is seriously lessened by the technical difficulties inherent in the discs I got through Amazon. They're playing, by the way, on a TV acquired from Amazon. Won't make these mistakes again; guess who's not renewing her Prime subscription again?

Anyone else having major problems with items from Amazon? Seems like everything I order lately has to be sent back or tolerated with sub-par performance. A disappointment, and a shame.",1438992000,,745,5.008064516129032

7093031,5,B00VKEWZQ2,"Murdoch Mysteries has its 100th episode in season 8 - quite an accomplishment, especially since all the main characters are played by the same actors since the beginning of the show, back in January of 2008. The 8th season takes place in 1902, and there's a LOT to explore along with the cleverly crafted murder mysteries.

It must be difficult to keep a show fresh for this long, but they manage to do it. A lot of that is due to the incredible characterizations - Constable Crabtree, in particular, lends comic relief that is a joy to watch. Season 8 has 18 episodes, too many to give a detailed synopsis for each. But I want to point out two things for these episodes. First: NEW inventions/attitudes/areas of study that came to be in real life in the early 1900's. And Second: REAL people that appear in the episodes.

Also, as you're watching, figure out which episodes pay homage to famous movies. Lastly, I recommend not skipping the Making Murdoch bonus features on the Blu-Ray/DVD release... Read more",1438992000,,1010,4.700564971751413

7093035,5,B00VKEWZQ2,"MURDOCH MYSTERIES, Season 8. This multi-award winning Canadian television series of crime dramas is a historical police procedural set in Toronto, now in the early years of the twentieth century.  It airs on the CBS in Canada, in the United States has run on PBS stations and is shown onOvation as THE ARTFUL DETECTIVE.  And it seems to have one foot in the United Kingdom, as ITV, a British creator of TV material, gets a production credit.  This time around, its star, Yannick Bisson, also gets a production credit.  The series is based on the popular novels by Maureen Jennings.  I received this as a review copy.  It contains the long-awaited 100th episode, in which wedding bells ring for major characters.  The box set contains five discs encompassing 18 episodes, approximately 792 minutes of entertainment, plus a 118 minute featurette of Making Murdoch, a 100th episode featurette, and a behind the scenes photo gallery.  And, thank goodness, subtitles, as some of the actors might be a bit difficult for Americans to follow.

The title character, ground-breaking detective William Murdoch, (Yannick Bisson, SUE THOMAS, F.B.EYE), pushes  the boundaries of Victorian-era criminal science by using then radical forensics, like fingerprints and trace evidence,  for the first time, to solve some of the citys most baffling, gruesome murders.  He is a kind, soft-spoken, religious, honest, hard-working and disciplined sort of man, plenty of charm, by no means one of the roistering detectives we so often see today.  He is ably assisted by Constable George Crabtree and has the support of his somewhat doubtful superior, Inspector Thomas Brackenreid, though at times even Brackenreid finds the detectives methods, and claims, somewhat overwhelming.
Bisson and the supporting case create an entertaining, warm ensemble.  Thomas Craig, (WHERE THE HEART IS), plays the blunt, bluff Insp. Brackenreid. The lovely Helene Joy, (DURHAM COUNTY), plays Murdochs on again/off again love interest, beautiful Dr. Julia Ogden, formerly the Stations coroner, now a psychiatrist. Newfoundland-born standup comic Jonny Harris, (HATCHING, MATCHING AND DISPATCHING), plays the entertaining Newfoundland-born Constable Crabtree, seemingly with his own native accent. (And he seems to get more screen time with every series).  Georgina Reilly, (THE L.A. COMPLEX), plays the pretty and lively Dr. Emily Grace. Guest stars include Peter Keleghan, ( The Newsroom),Patrick McKenna, (The Red Green Show), and Peter Outerbridge,(Orphan Black), the original Murdoch in the TV movies that preceded the series.

During Season 8, we see that, after his brutal beating by a dockyard gang, Insp. Brackenreids future is uncertain.  Constable Crabtree faces life-altering changes. Drs. Grace and Ogden enthusiastically join the womens suffrage movement.  And, in the 100th episode, Murdoch and Ogden finally walk the aisle.  Furthermore, even though he is generally preoccupied with law enforcement, Murdoch, as in earlier series, often crosses paths with some of the famous figures of the time, including again, Thomas Edison;  W.C. Fields, Bat Masterson, supposedly Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and American President Theodor Roosevelt.  The plots are original, tight and entertaining. The episodes are:
1. On the Waterfront, Part 1.  A businessman is bludgeoned to death in the dining room of the Queens Hotel: the crime points to the OShea brothers and their dockyard gang, the same gang who brutally beat Insp. Brackenreid.  The cops go to war against the OSheas; Julia and Emily start a fight of their own, for womens votes.
2. On the Waterfront, Part 2.  Murdoch continues his investigation of the OSheas and their mysterious boss.  Brackenreid also pursues them outside the law.  Julia, Emily and their fellow suffragists face court charges; the first female Canadian lawyer defends them.
3. Glory Days. Former U.S. lawman Bat Masterson, now a NYC sports reporter, is in Toronto covering a wrestling match.  He claims to have seen  Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid . He agrees to help the local constabulary hunt down the outlaws. This episode was directed by Yannick Bisson, its star.
4. Holy Matrimony, Murdoch!  100th episode. With the wedding of Murdoch and Ogden fast approaching, they are distracted by the investigation of  a man killed by his wife.  New evidence comes to light; they follow it,, adding to the confusion and chaos of the wedding.
5. Murdoch Takes Manhattan. In their 1902 New York City honeymoon, the newlyweds trip over a planned assignation of U.S. President Teddy Roosevelt: the assassination of former U.S. President McKinley receives mention. Squabbles over the early high-end Toronto automobiles are an amusing subplot.
6. The Murdoch Appreciation Society.  A corpse is discovered in a public park.  Evidence found on it leads Murdoch down a twisting path of clues, real and counterfeit.  Crabtree hunts for a cadaver gone missing from the medical school.
7.  What Lies Buried.  Renovations of the police station: workers find a body buried in the buildings cement back yard. The dead man is identified as a constable who disappeared in 1881. Particularly interesting in its treatment of homosexuality, still illegal at the time.
8. High Voltage. A man is killed by his own newly invented electric chair. We meet Thomas Edison again.
9. The Keystone Constables.  Comedian Bert Grady, after a killer vaudeville performance, is shot to death in a dark alley.  He was a hit onstage, but was hated by his fellow vaudevillians, leaving the police with a wide cast of suspects, including a young W.C. Fields.
10. Murdoch and the Temple of Death.  The body of a man in the river leads Murdoch and Crabtree to a mysterious Byzantine-type structure hidden in deep forest, known as the Temple of Death to the locals.  The detective seeks the help of an archaeologist friend in searching for a revered relic within its walls.
11. All that Glitters.  A surveyor for the railroad collapses at the feet of Crabtree and Higgins, his last words eagle flight. Murdoch and Crabtree train up to Northern Ontario to follow his trail.
12. The Devil Wears Whalebone.  A brick thrown through the window of a corset shop kills a young model. The blame appears to lie with protesters against the restrictive garment, but the detective thinks theres more to it.
13. The Incurables. In the isolation ward at Ogdens asylum, the incurablescriminally insane murderesses, appear to have killed a nurse.  Ogden is determined to find out who, why and how, despite the danger to herself.
14.  Torontos Girl Problem.  Dr. Grace recognizes a stabbing victim as the hostess of a party shed attended the night before.  She goes undercover to infiltrate the dead womans shoplifting ring, which was based on a historic London one, while Brackenreids nephew arrives from London to serve as Toronto Station 5s newest constable.
15. Shipwreck. A devout young womans murder unexpectedly reunites Murdoch with his childhood mentor, Father Keegan.  The two work together to solve the crime and locate a missing priest.  The detective recalls a formative event from his youth.  An early view of a problem still plaguing the Catholic Church.
16. Crabtree Mania.  Wrestling champion Handsome Randolph Henderson dies after a match. Crabtree suspects foul play, asks permission to look further into the death.  Can it be that wrestling is not what it seems? The suffragists consider whether to align with the temperance movement to gain votes.
17. Election Day.  Tensions run high on election day; a man is strangled to death shortly after he votes.  The murder might have implications for Canadian national security.  Crabtree gets great news; the suffragists scramble to rectify a mistake on the ballots that harms them.
18. Artful Detective.  Bodies pile up in the morgue, victims killed in different ways.  The detective hunts a serial killer/mutilator with his invented electric Taser gun.  Crabtrees hopes, after soaring, are suddenly deflated.

I have previously reviewed Murdoch Seasons 1, 2 and 7 on their respective pages, and loved them. Mind you, while the earlier series do offer some backstory, it is possible to pick the entertainment up at any point. Murdoch is an interesting character, troubled yet talented, while the interplay at the cop shop is touching and entertaining. The turn of the 20th century environment is well-presented, in clothing, social life, standards, interiors, mores, transportation, the mix of bicycles, horses and autos on the roads.  I admired the depictions of the suffrage movement and the problems of homosexuals in this particular series. In fact, this series seems to grow on me, and I consider this one the best yet.  Highly recommended.",1438387200,24,8754,5.232974910394265

By the way, the lesbian was murdered, and police officer was sentence to jail.  Hmmmm, it sure doesn't seem that Murdoch Mysteries are advocating any kind of alternative lifestyle.
