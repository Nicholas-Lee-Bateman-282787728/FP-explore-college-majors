7860839,3,6304075278,"The episode starts out as being about ageism, but then loses its way. The story stomps on its own message, by having him decide, for no really good reason, that he agrees with his people, and agrees to die. I don't find giving in to family pressure a compelling reason to change his mind.",1327622400,,288,4.351851851851852
7860840,2,6304075278,"Plot:  The Enterprise is helping Dr. Timicin by letting him make modified photon torpedoes to launch into a dying star and try to revitalize it.  He's doing this because his own star is dying and will totally perk out in a few more generations.  Unfortunately, the experminet fails horribly on the test star and Dr. Timicin is brought back to his home planet.  Lwaxana Troi (our dear Couselor's mother) is infatuated by the doctor, who also is in love with her.  But, he sends a shock by telling her that he must go back and complete his ""Resolution"", which is the official title of big-goodbye-to-friends-and-family-before-I-commit-suicide-because-of-my-planet's-customs.  Well, the doctor doesn't relish the thought of doing this because he's convinced that he still can help solve the problem with his planet's dying sun.  Lwaxana Troi urges him to go against tradition and try and still help out.  Unfortunately, the moment Dr. Timicin declares asylum, the planet's government goes berserk.  After talking with his daughter, (who's played by Michelle Forbes, although I think she's better as Ro Laren), Dr. Timicin begins to think things over...

Frankly, this episode bothers me for several reasons:  One is that it seems that Dr. Timicin's government is more willing to follow tradition (and force the doctor to commit suicide) than think more practically (save their homeworld which may cease to exist in a matter of generations).  But, this is a strong episode in the acting and is especially interesting that the plot revolves around guest characters instead of the main cast.

Overall, I give it 2, primarily for the acting and some elements of the plot, but not necessarily the end results (otherwise, a 1).  It also has some serious questions that need to be asked at the end of the episode.  And it leaves the presumption that government-mandated suicide is okay.",1157587200,,1876,5.104918032786885
