Only problem I have is with the scoring and tabs which do not seem to quite match the presentation on the video itself. The words of the songs don't seem to line up with the notes above or tab below. Which takes some working around. But I especially like the fact that Mr. Sokolow sings throughout as I am more of a singer than a guitar player and prefer playing the guitar as backup to singing. Above all the principles he demonstrates on these songs are applicable to any song suitable for chord melody, jazz or not.",1494547200,,583,4.407407407407407

8467161,5,B005DL6PFA,"By beginners, he doesn't mean absolute beginners at guitar, but closer to advanced beginners, which is where I would put myself. While he says that the arrangements are primarily first position chords, you will need to know some barre chord shapes as well. Still, I think these are probably pretty simple arrangements as jazz standards go, but they sound wonderful to my ear. Now, I'm still working on the first song (What a Wonderful World) in the companion DVD to this one, Jazz Chord Solos for Beginners. But I plan on tackling Autumn Leaves next. I've been working on it for a month, and I think it will take me another month before I can play it well enough for the girls I go with. If you are an advanced beginner, then you can play these arrangements, if you take the time and put in the effort. Intermediate players will probably find a lot easier. In either case, this DVD is a bargain.",1417910400,5,895,4.4969325153374236
