1820424,5,B00007LP8P,"The episodes on Lost at Sea aren't a great as those on Nautical Nonsense, but this is still a great group of shows. There is the 'lost episode' ""The Sponge Who Could Fly"" which spoofs the musical cartoons Disney and others have put out, but it was a weak episode (including live action from Patchy the Pirate). This episode also has commentary. The best episodes were: ""Boating School"" - where SpongeBob, with Patrick's help, cheats on his boating exam; ""Suds"" - SpongeBob gets sick, Patrick plays doctor;and ""Youre Shoe's Untied"" - featuring a great Gary ending. Also on this dvd there is ""Prehibernation Week"", ""Plankton"", ""Bubble Buddy"", ""Chaperone"" and there is ""Mermaidman and Barnacleboy II"". Unlike Nautical Nonsense, this dvd doesn't contain much in the way of extras. There's SpongeBob's 7 life strategies (a cute commercial for the cartoon) and the story board for ""The Sponge Who Could Fly"". This dvd also has previews for several of the Nickelodeon cartoon.",1051142400,8,969,5.0625
1820425,4,B00007LP8P,"The episode ""Bubble Buddy"" makes this DVD worth owning alone.  But all the episodes on this DVD will make you laugh.  And it's worth owning because everytime you watch a Spongebob episode, you catch some witty thing you never realized before.
The only drawback is not enough special features.  This disc has more than the last 2 DVDs released, but I would like to see more ""behind the scenes""  Watching Tom Kenny, Bill Fagerbakke, and Rodger Bumpass perform the voices on the Nautical Nonsense DVD was so cool.  I would like there to be more of that.  I realize that they probably didn't videotape them doing every episode, but I hope they do with any new episodes they make.",1046304000,7,675,4.630252100840337
1820426,5,B00007LP8P,"This DVD has some of my favorite episodes on it. You have Mermaidman and Barnacleboy II where Spongebob gets his chance to become a superhero.

1820443,5,B00007LP8P,My grandchildren love SpongeBob and like to watch all the time on t.v. so I ordered several dvds for the car for them to watch while we are going back and forth to all the carpools. Lots of fun for the kids and they just laugh and are spellbound.,1364860800,,246,4.040816326530612
1820444,5,B00007LP8P,"This DVD is absolutely hilarious.  I loved it.  I am not a young child but it is still incredibly funny.  I've never understood why this cartoon is based called a childrens cartoon.  Most of the adults or older viewers I know think the show is even funnier than the kids do.  More than half of the humor on here adults can easily relate to and kids cannot.  Another thing I've never understood is how a cartoon about a talking sponge and his undersea friends could be so funny.  Its beyond me how stupid the concept is but how funny the show is.  This DVD, Lost at Sea, is the best DVD my family owns ( my younger brother has three others ).  From top to bottom the episodes on this one are hilarious.  Not one of them ever gets boring.  The Sponge Who Could Fly is a classic double episode.  Plankton is another uproarious episode.  The talking sponge is by far the best character in the show.  Patrick the Starfish is also hilarious but theres just something about Spongebob that is incredibly funny.  But don't take my word for it, watch Nickelodeon and watch this cartoon",1060214400,4,1075,4.413265306122449
