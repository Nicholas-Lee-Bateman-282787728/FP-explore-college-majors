8121229,5,B000FDK75K,"Gregg Bissonette is not only a top-notch, well-rounded drummer, but one heck of a cool guy. I've come across some people who have perceived his pedagogy as a bit goofy. I personally prefer his friendly approach, like a good pal you just got together with to swap licks and tips, instead of the ""let me tell you how it's done"" style used by many of today's drumset athletes.

These two recycled instructional videos from the 90s stand the test of time (not always the case with other name artists'), and make a great companion to his more recent instructional material. ""Private Lesson"" mainly focuses on being a versatile drummer (from playing brushes to double-bass pounding), and the benefits that come with that; once again, thanks to his friendly, honest delivering, Gregg succeeds at making it look like an actually attainable goal. ""Playing, Reading and Soloing with a Band"" examines practical ways to make charts or ""cheat sheets"", that will help you concentrate more on interpreting and learning material quicker. The songs and the band are great! Both videos also include a fair share of cool chops' demonstrations.

I do have a small complain: Back in the 90s, book/CD packages containing the play-along tracks and charts for both videos were released, too. It would have been cool to include that material here. Still, it doesn't take off not even half a star of my rating for this excellent DVD.",1401580800,,1407,4.907563025210084
8121230,5,B000FDK75K,"I wish the title of this DVD was more clear. I have been hoping for DVD releases of Gregg's first two instructional vhs tape from the 90's for years. Lo and behold they had been released a few years ago, but with this title it was very difficult to figure that out. Besides my complaints about the title, though, this two DVD set is excellent. Gregg's first two videos, ""Private Lesson"" and ""Playing, Reading, and Soloing with a Band"" are presented in very good quality, along with some current lessons. This is an amazing value at the price. I am so happy I found this. There is so much material here for a drum student of any level to be entertained by and learn from. Gregg's personable nature and great skill make these a joy to watch. I can't recommend this product highly enough.",1389744000,2,785,4.458333333333333
8121231,3,B000FDK75K,I was very disappointed that the movie was not in the original Italian. This has happened with two movies I ordered. There was no way in the desciption to distinguish if the movies were in Italian or English. Please ask your distributors to be more specific about the language. I did not want the movies dubbed in English. I am not satisfied with the purchase. Please try to revise the descriptions of the foreign films. Thank you.,1240963200,2,431,4.6103896103896105
8121232,1,B000FDK75K,"This is another Sophia Loren classic poorly served by an outrageously mediocre print: video quality is worse than that of a slow-speed VHS tape. Don't be misled by the Studio listing of ""Carlo Ponte"" into believing that this is an official studio release - the copyright on the package belongs to something called ""Educational Films."" The absence of a security seal suggests that this is an internet-only product. Unless you have a very high tolerance for bad video quality, you should avoid this DVD and wait for a version to be released that's at least passable.",1198281600,6,564,4.885416666666667
