3797301,3,B001U7NW0W,"I had one problem with this package of videos. One of the videos was titled ""Clifford's Rock and Roll"". I am the type of parent who does not want my children exposed to rock and roll. I was just looking for good wholesome videos that taught little, cute lessons. Most of the clifford episodes are great! I was just dissapointed to have one of the Dvd's all about rock and roll because one DVD has 8 episodes on it! and that was just such a waste. - Jesus Christ is the King and is returning soon!",1246147200,4,496,4.177083333333333

8343064,1,B001U7NW0W,"Premise: A little girl loves her puppy so much that it keeps on growing, leading to many hilarious and poignant scenes of learning and emotional growth.

Annoyance level (1-10): I am giving this show a 4, simply because any parent must have to be constantly thinking about the work and upkeep it would take to care for this giant dog. Are you telling me that Emily-Elizabeth is going to pick up after Clifford every time!? Please - Harrison barely picks up his puzzle pieces. A dog Clifford's size would likely throw my back out after one week.

Educational content: From what I can tell, there isn't much. Life seems to be a series of adventures that have nothing to do with school, the classics, or Greco-Roman philosophy. I guess life is a playground to the young, but Clifford should be guiding Emily-Elizabeth on the basics of algebra at the very least.

Questionable content that makes me wonder: Why does Clifford's mouth always appear to salivate more when that one pudgy dog comes on screen? I swear that if those two were left alone in a most dangerous game scenario, there would be only one dog remaining...

If I were a script writer: I would like to see Clifford battle for Emily-Elizabeth's life with an equally giant creature, such as Godzilla or a freak badger that survived Chernobyl.",1363910400,,1301,4.71806167400881

8343069,5,B001U7NW0W,I bought this for my grandson for his 2nd birthday. He loves Clifford and asks to watch it before bed each night.

8343072,1,B001U7NW0W,"I ordered this product more than a month ago and paid for it as well.  I have not heard from the vendor, and heard from Amazon last week that I would get a refund if the product was not shipped within 30 days.  Of the 4 products ordered the day I placed my order, I did not receive 3 of them!  I have never had this happen!  Poor service and lack of communication by vendor.  Amazon at least followed up.  I am in an awkward place, I need the item and have paid for it, and don't know if I should reorder from another vendor.  Awkward place to be in.  Be warry of this vendor.",1281830400,2,576,3.9478260869565216
