8709167,1,B00V4TUED4,According to insiders... one of the producers.. Tony.. is a lying manipulator who finances his B movies by coning investors and never paying them back. He pays the actors with the investors money upfront... and ditches the investors. Not a good look for a wanna be producer....with no  credentials. The cast and crew deserve better and are potentially ruining their reputation by dealing with someone with such a lack of qualifications and character. Hollywood beware... distributors be ware when dealing with this chronic liar.,1492992000,,528,5.285714285714286

8709169,1,B00V4TUED4,"Low budget movie that offer nothing but an eye candy view of Eva which was the only good actor in this god awful movie. I do understand the movie was made with little to no money but because this movie was made in 2013 after 2012 when YouTube was offering HD video viewing and cameras at HD quality was cheap enough to film at good low end Hollywood style quality. This movie seem to not even do that. Reminds me when I use to watch shorts online in the early 2000s. The quality was at that part but its worst because it was made 10 years later when issues with lighting is easier to address. Also the shakey camera was also dreadful to set threw.

The movie itself was slow and boring. They could have the movie by 1 hour and could gotten a better understanding and non sleeping viewing experience of the movie.

Got the movie at Rebox, the best place to pick up crappy unknown movies that I wish I never got.

I gave it one star for completing a movie. I know its hard to just finish a movie but beside that, the movie was awful.

The few people who are giving 5 to 4 star are most likely family members and people that had some hand in the movie to give it some good standard for people to buy I.",1445644800,,1199,4.111111111111111

8709172,4,B00V4TUED4,"Extremely fast paced in beginning, then a little bit slower in second half. But still more captivating than the last movie I saw in theaters. This is def not a hollywood movie but. its about students getting rich and having a good (and bad) time while doing it. Interesting story well told.",1437523200,,290,4.596153846153846
8709173,5,B00V4TUED4,"saw this film in pre-screening. thought it was good. basically this is just a really well made micro-budget film. definitely entertaining, shows the director has some good stuff going on. worth the watch, you'll get some giggles.

essentially it follows a group of college kids as they devise means to play the stock market and flip houses in their neighborhood. the group slowly grows less and less cohesive, however, as some of them use their newly acquired fame and fortune for drug-induced and nefarious purposes. its funny, they go to parties, they get money, they drink, and they learn lessons.",1431388800,,600,5.0
