8442694,4,B004V2FWQ0,"Sanam, from 1997, if I'm being honest, was probably an attempt to resurrect the career of 'Vivek Mushran'. Mushran's first or second movie was Saudagar, which was a big hit. But perhaps the movie was successful because of Raaj Kumar and Dilip Kumar being together, their stars having not yet waned (but were about to).

1992 movies such as 'Saatwan Aasman' and 'Prem Deewane' weren't big hits (no smudge on their quality) and by 1994 his career was dead in the water. He made a few movies throughout the 90's, trying to replicate success, but didn't get it.

Sanam is one such movie, and he received A LOT OF HELP.

Everyone who was someone in 90's cinema (other than leading actors) appears in this movie, Anupham Kher, Sanjay Dutt (okay, one leading actor), Shakti Kapoor, Gulshan Grover, Kader Khan, Razak Khan, Asrani, Harish Patel (Run Fatboy Run),  Dalip Tahil and Monisha Koirala (who starred with Mushran in Saudagar) all appear, in some way or another, and actually Sanam doesn't really have a main star, just a gaggle of cameos (although Koirala and Mushran are probably the faces you end up seeing the most). So it should be bad, right?

No, in fact, it's great. It's a very watchable and enjoyable movie. Even if the script is a bit flimsy, the side-scenes and random dialogues are so good that, as an entertainer, the film can't fail. This is, in fact, one of Anupham Kher's best performances, he's HILARIOUS! Everyone delivers the goods, except Shakti Kapoor's role isn't ""villainous"" enough, but you just find yourself really enjoying whatever it is that's going on; it's a great movie to watch.

Amidst all the funny sub-plots, Mushran is very earnest and heartfelt as the romantic hero, and ends up saving the day. Great movie.",1372291200,,1744,4.796666666666667
