8578231,3,B00C7MW5H0,We love these two movies so we bought this DVD for our Grandchildren.  We returned to first one as it did not work in our Blue Ray DVD player.  They sent us another one and it isn't working either.  We have decided we are doing something wrong.  Can anyone help us with this?  We play other movies all the time with no problem.  Thank you for any help.,1422144000,,352,4.102941176470588
