7989115,5,B000094FGG,My girls have always loved this movie.,1451865600,,38,4.571428571428571
7989116,4,B000094FGG,"Its a cute movie. When my cousins and I took road trips this was always in the pile of movies we'd bring with us. It is a movie that doesn't have a lot of replay value, and its more for nostalgia factor, as this movie was awesome watching it as a kid but doesn't age alongside you. I just wanted to have a copy like my cousins does, so I can show it to my kids and relive old memories. Definitely worth the 5 dollars, especially if you have younger kids to show it too.",1445644800,,469,3.9473684210526314
7989117,4,B000094FGG,"This is a fun and crazy movie. We used to check it out at the Library, but their copy is lost or damaged, so we started looking for it. When we found it for such a great price we snatched it up. Some day maybe we will get one for the Library too. It will probably not appeal to adults, but it is a fun movie about 3 teenage cheerleaders who get zapped by lightening and get super powers. Enjoy.",1390608000,,394,3.9375
7989118,1,B000094FGG,"This is actually worse then the Battletoads ploit from 1992. Would you belive they actually got Jennifer Love Hewitt to star in this film. At least when Battletoads was ripping of TMNT,it was still popular at the time but The Groove Squad was ripping Power Rangers in 2002 when Power Rangers was long gone and no long popular. The cast is bland and forgettable. The villains are obvious and phoned in a mile away. The battles are chessy & corny at best. The Animation is so-so at best. The story is tired and done to death. The only reason I will watch it because the 3 main girls are hot but even then I will still hate in the long run. I give this film a 1 out of 10.",1313798400,,669,4.153846153846154
7989119,4,B000094FGG,An entertaining cartoon - I actually liked this one enough to buy it!  Who could have figured?  4 stars!,1180742400,,104,4.421052631578948
