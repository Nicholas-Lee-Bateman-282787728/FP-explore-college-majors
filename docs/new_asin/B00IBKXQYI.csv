6256471,4,B00IBKXQYI,"You can play around with time in a documentary, start at the beginning, start at the middle or end and jump back, that sort of thing.  This doc takes that one step further - it starts in the middle and ... keeps going!  I kept thinking well now is when they will probably talk about how the members met and formed the band, early successes and failures, etc.  Nope.  It's a micro-view of the downfall of the band, which is interesting and in fact after I'd watched Westways, I came back to this one and appreciated it more.  but for someone new to the band, a casual viewer looking for just a straightforward story of the band film, this is not the doc you seek.",1420329600,,662,4.264

6256475,3,B00IBKXQYI,"Huge Clash fan, so I was excited to check out this documentary.  It can't help but be ""okay"" just based on all of the great band and concert footage in here.  I think my disappointment with the movie though is that the title is completely misleading.  Rise of the Clash?  huh?  Where?  15 minutes into the movie, they're like, ""So the Clash just put out out London Calling and Sandinista and decided to bring back Bernie"".

No doubt the story of how the Clash fell apart is interesting and compelling.  And this is a worthwhile documentary to get some of that story.  I was kind of hoping to truly see a complete overview of the band from start to finish as the title suggests.

Still the greatest band of all time.",1409788800,2,715,4.3893129770992365
6256476,1,B00IBKXQYI,"I found this documentary unbearable and boring and turned it off after 30 minutes. From the opening sleep inducing voice of Pearl Harbour , to the bored sounding narrator , to the recycled footage that has been pulled from the MUCH BETTER Clash documents before this.
It didn't pull me in at all and aside from the sparce Mick Jones interview moments, I didn't find any of the interview subjects interesting or hold any credence in their stories.  Westway To World is the best chronicle of the rise and fall of The Clash, from the mouths of those that lived it , The Clash.  Who cares what a bunch of mostly critics, magazine writers and groupies say?! Especially ones as boring as these!

Stick with Westway To The World, the at times floored in format Strummer documentary The Future Is Unwritten and The Clash film Rude Boy as the best documents on the band.

This came accross as misdirected mess to me, and I am a big Clash fan. Im all for objective views and different directions for documentaries. I have seen multiple on David Bowie for example that are all different and interesting . Just not of shite like this!",1404864000,7,1122,4.567164179104478
6256477,5,B00IBKXQYI,"Saw this recently, and it was quite fascinating.  Like another reviewer commented, this documentary pretty much concentrates on the downfall.  For me, being only a very casual fan, that's when it gets interesting.

What shocked me about this quite revealing backstory was the hipocracy of Joe Strummer.  Joe, essentially being ""Mr. Civil Rights, etc.,"" was nothing more than a yes man to their very dominant manager, Bernie Rhodes.  But it goes even deeper than that, because Joe chose Bernie over his bandmate and songwriting partner, Mick Jones.  In fact, Joe Strummer doesn't exactly come off as a sympathetic character.  He holds it against Mick Jones that he's a spliff head.  Is behind throwing Topper Headon out of the band for heroin addiction.  Toward the end, Joe WAY too late in the game, realizes what a huge mistake he's made after a chance encounter with Mick Jones.  Actually, Joe Strummer goes as far as following his old bandmate to his holiday spot in Nassau, only to be told essentially ""Too little too late, mate.""  Mick had rousing success with Big Audio Dynamite, so why would he want to go ""back there""?

Mick Jones makes a welcome appearance in the film, and he is very pleasant.  Two guitarists were hired to replace him: Nick Sheppard and Vince White (although Mick Jones was totally irreplaceable).  A noticeably drunk Vince White stands on the street with a beer bottle in hand, and the bitterness toward Joe Strummer and Bernie Rhodes is pretty palpable.  Moreover he explains how, while the band is touring stadiums around the world, making gobs of money, he and Rob were making all of 300 pounds a week.  And working a grueling tour schedule to boot.  Manager Bernie Rhodes was quite the task master.  Replacement drummer Pete Howard echoes these sentiments, revealing that by then the dynamics within the band had grown uncomfortably toxic.

Within ten years, The Clash had deteriorated into self parody, and eventually nobody cared anymore, least of all the band itself.",1402185600,10,2003,4.9431137724550895
6256478,4,B00IBKXQYI,"First half offers little or nothing new and does feel like a cut and paste job but the second half burns to life with the voices of the Clash 2.0 stringers, Vince White, Nick Shepherd, and Pete Howard. Their passionate, frustrated recollections of the bands crash landing into corporatism actually ad weight to what came before and make The Rise and Fall Of The Clash feel like a long lost final ""CLASH"" statement (thanks guys!!!)

The great irony here is that there seems to be much more to learn about practical life from the ill-fate of Clash 2 than the sublime Strummer/Jones years (you can certainly hear the most interesting part of that on the records :). Alas: This documentary (along with the C2 lost songs and demos) is certainly a must watch for anyone still puzzling over CUT THE CRAP.",1400457600,3,797,4.652482269503546
6256479,4,B00IBKXQYI,"As a Clash fan since my youth, I've just about screened and listened to all manner of Clash documentaries and retrospectives, whether produced by Don Letts, the BBC, Julian Temple, etc. Inevitably all these previous treatments of the band's history would sum up the period after Mick Jones' sacking with the ""oh by the way, Joe kept the band going a few more years but it doesn't really matter."" No one that I know of has really tried to come to grips with this period and its significance, until now. Most reviews I've read have dismissed this documentary as a rehash of previous releases, but I would disagree. Its true a number of screen shots are from Rude Boy (the producer of this doc made Rude Boy), Don Letts' work, and other widely seen materials, however, there is enough original content to make this documentary worthwhile. Specifically, this is the first documentary to at least attempt an in-depth evaluation of Bernie Rhodes' influence on the band, in particular when Joe rehired him after Sandinista. To my knowledge, no other documentary has included extensive interviews with Vince White, Nick Shepherd, and Pete Howard. The viewer can't help but feel sympathy for these guys, being part of the Clash was their big break and it ended in complete disappointment.  They were denied the opportunity to record a proper record and have probably been haunted by ""what ifs"" ever since. It was great to hear their voices and have them rewritten back into Clash history. Although some of the documentary's negative reviews are warranted, the productions values aren't great (but not Cut the Crap bad), however, this documentary provides important insight into the band's history. This unpleasant period helps us understand the Strummer-Jones relationship, Jones' musical direction with BAD, and why it was so hard for Strummer to forgive himself during his long wilderness period. The Clash Mark 2 is essential to the story of the band without necessarily tarnishing its overall legacy.  While this documentary made me grimace, the Clash (specifically Joe) fell hard indeed, its still part of the story that I want to know.",1400112000,37,2132,5.019774011299435
6256480,3,B00IBKXQYI,"Seems like a cut and paste documentary. If you are new to the Clash and want to a little insight into the end of the band, then you might learn a thing or three but if you know the story, nothing new here. There really wasn't much focus on the band's forming or early years. Which makes one think that when they say ""Rise"" they are taking about the commercial success of the band. Though any fan would tell you their more creative period was before Combat Rock. I'm unclear what Viviane Albertine goal was here and the fact that there were no current interviews with Topper or Paul seems strange to me. Also she seems to play down the heavy use of amphetamine by other members of the band and Topper's creative contributions to the bands success including the writing of the song that broke the band in the US - Rock the Casbah.

Rightly so good old Bernie Rhodes as the villain but for some reason they didn't interview him for the film. However, it is clear that the two leaders of the gang were in conflict with what direction the band should go. Mick was happy to see the band go on to more commercial success while Joe continued to struggle with the idea. In the end there were really no winners and I think that is plainly told.

That said there is a lot of great footage and a few interesting interviews. Though most of the vintage footage and older interviews have been mined from other better documentaries including Rude Boy, Punk Rock the Movie and others.",1398124800,20,1467,4.409594095940959

6256483,4,B00IBKXQYI,"You should buy this disc. This documentary is worthwhile for any Clash fan that's already seen Westway to the World. To echo some previous reviews, this is the only documentary that actually goes into the Clash Mk II, post Mick & Topper. That they do so in-depth makes this doc all the more worthwhile. Also it doesn't re-hash previous footage for the most part. The interviews with former Clash-associated people really help to fill in the behind-the-scenes picture without repeating set pieces from Westway. Ray Jordan (Clash security man) and Pearl Harbor (Simenon's ex-girlfriend and Clash DJ) are two highlights. Love Pearl's description as to why the Clash were such a great band.
Because TRAFOTC goes into the entire story of the downward slide after Mick was booted out, the halo is ripped off St. Joe and rightfully so. Mick wasn't blameless either, but this doc doesn't really go into that like the Westway film does. Bottom line, it seems that both Joe's and Mics's egos got the better of them both; by the time they realized it, the jig was up.

Another reviewer asked why wasn't Bernie, Topper or Simemon interviewed for this film. If you know the Clash story, then you'll know that Bernie was an elusive character at best and an a-hole at worst. A guy like that ain't sitting still for no interview, especially after the mess he made of the Clash at the end. Paul and Topper, who knows?",1455667200,,1400,4.737704918032787
6256484,4,B00IBKXQYI,"Danny Garcia's documentary is often overlooked, but it's a great story about the decline of The Clash. It delves into details of The Clash Mk II (after Topper Headon and co-founder Mick Jones are replaced) that is kind of a lost history to most fans. It's a sad story in some ways, but an important one. It leaves you wondering what might have happened if Joe Strummer hadn't been so taken in by manager Bernie Rhodes.",1452988800,,418,4.5131578947368425
6256485,4,B00IBKXQYI,"While not as good as the 'be-all, end-all' Clash documentary that is 'Westway to the World', The Rise and Fall of The Clash is still towards the top of the crop as far as Clash documentaries go.  Especially since it goes over a time period usually glossed over.  TR&FoTC really goes in depth into what ended the band.",1444176000,2,317,4.448275862068965

6256487,4,B00IBKXQYI,"Very good buy. I was worried this was going to be one of those cheap DVD's we've all been stuck with before, but much to my relief it's not. It's not the best DVD I've ever bought, but it's worth the price I paid, for sure. Much like ""Clash: The Joe Strummer Story"", it's worth it to see how much the band has aged and what they have to say about the band days. Also, the guys in the ""post-Mick"" version of The Clash are interviewed, something that's new to me. Honestly, I didn't even know who they were until I saw this. I've always enjoyed reading what Mick Jones has to say. He's always laid back and super relaxed, like he's eaten a handful of Xanax - that's the way he is normally. He's got a big smile on his face most of the time he's talking! This disc isn't quite as good as ""Clash: The Joe Strummer Story"" but like I said it's good enough for the price. It's mostly about the demise of the band, and I think Joe not being a big part of this makes it better. That's nothing against Joe, it's just that a lot of what I've read or seen on this subject has focused on Joe. Also, the fact that a lot of time has gone by helps as well. That has enabled anger and old resentments to cool down or go away altogether so the band members have a clearer perspective on the past.",1441584000,,1278,4.055335968379446
6256488,3,B00IBKXQYI,"everything is a bit out of order here. Paul is missing, Bernie is missing to tell his side of the story. A bit drab if you have seen any of the other documentaries about the Clash or Joe. Honestly I would skip this one unless you're in dire need of a Clash fix and have seen everything else. Three stars because there's some cool interviews with people who are normally left out of the story. Just don't like how it jumps around and puts stories out of order. If you're really looking for something great, check out Johnny Green's book about them entitled ""A Riot of Our Own: Night and Day with the Clash"".

8640652,5,B00IBKXQYI,"To say that this film is poignant is an understatement. To say it is entertaining is a lie. It is absolutely gut wrenching. This is indeed a very interesting documentary. However, be aware that this is a documentary of the FALL of the Clash - the RISE only leading up to the post-""Combat Rock"" years in which the Fall started. As such, it succeeds wonderfully, giving us the painful experience of the Fall of The Clash  in all in it's non-glory.
 Peter Howard shakes his head in frustration, and seems ready to explode at times. Vince White breaks down in tears. Nick Sheppard and Terry Chimes both have fond memories, but with an obviously heavy tinge of regret over what could(many would say should) have been. Mick Jones is the only one of the 3 members pictured on the first LP cover that was interviewed directly for this film, and is almost over-gracious in his description of the events, saying The Clash did ""something good"" and that ""luck and fortunate timing"" were main ingredients. Mick sugar coats the re-mix of ""Combat Rock"" from his original 2 LP mix to Glyn Johns final mix, saying that it was ""a cymbal level thing"" when it was really the beginning of the end. Why, he even summons up enough grace to call Bernie Rhodes ""an intelligent man"", while Ray Jordan calls him an ""a@@hole"" twice in his first 5 words in the film. Joe and Paul's comments are both represented in several archival sound and video clips.
 Ray Lowry's illustrations are a real plus, adding even more tension to the tone of the film, especially the Topper Headon and Bernie Rhodes sections. Don't expect much from the unreleased live video of the last incarnation of the band, with only ""Brand New Cadillac"" and ""Junco Partner"" included and neither complete.
 The talking heads are few in number, and were all at least somewhat, if not directly connected to the band. Chris Salewicz says the band completed the big 3 ""The Beatles, The Stones, The Clash"" and that ""they were a pure intuitive Art movement"" that worked ""on three levels: performance art, street theatre, and the poetry of satire"", adding that ""It lasted because of the great truths in that music, and the wit in which those lyrics, and music, is delivered."" Jock Scot calls the band ""something that was obscured"". Viv Albertine notes that it was ""the artistic conflict between those two"" (Strummer/Jones) that made the song writing so great, but also lead to the end of the band. Pat Gilbert argues that ""The Clash were unique among all rocks bands  because they spoke to a higher purpose."" This is what makes the band's demise so sad, or as Vince White says in the film ""It's just really depressing."" Vince inadvertently coins a new word by drunkenly mixing the word corporate into the Marxist term co-opted, saying ""They were corprated"" near the end of the film.
 A few interesting historical details are uncovered in the interview of Fayney, who was the sound engineer who completed the final LP ""Cut the Crap"" with Bernie Rhodes after all the band members were gone. A few painful details are shared of the last months of the Fall of the Clash, a Fall which Mick Jones describes as ""inevitable"" several times. However, what makes this film important is that it gives a feel of the higher purpose that The Clash aimed for, the change in the world that the failed Art movement that was Punk Rock never delivered.
 The most articulate voice regarding that is Pearl Harbour. Not only did she DJ for the band's notable 17 show stand at Bond's in NYC in 1981, warm up for the band with her band Pearl Harbour and the Explosions many times, and ""hang out"" with the band for years, she sang encores with the band, and was Paul Simonon's Wife during the years this film documents. Of these, she only mentions being the DJ and hanging out with the band. She calls Simonon ""the bass player Paul."" In this film, she speaks of the Fall of the Clash as follows: ""It is hard to replace people. It is hard to replace your youth. You can't have money and pretend you don't. You know all this stuff goes into the whole punk rock picture. It doesn't go into every Rock and Roll story, but it goes into punk rock because punk rock is supposed to mean a certain thing. I don't see it as much of a mystery that when you get a little bit older, you can't be a crazy-ass punk unless you're a loser."" It is telling that she says this with not anger, or a sneer, but the hint of a tear.
 While the Clash City Rockers never did ""liquify everybody gone dry"" or ""burn down the suburbs with a half-closed eye"", they certainly did inspire, empower, and - most of all - change people. While they never did change the world, as Ray Jordan notes, they did change people: ""Most of the people I know will tell you that that band changed their lives."" If you are one of those people, you should take the time and endure the pain to watch this DVD.",1497916800,,4864,4.531890660592255
