If you are NOT clear what was, what is and what will be the art of B-boying; then this DVD package is a solid investment! No Hip Hop 101 in some university can do what this DVD does! I like the fact that it contains action, not just talk. But I do appreciate the fact that the people doing the talking are/were the experts. I know, because I was a part of the movement!

1778956,5,B00006IUIP,"prior to viewing this film, my idea of breakin' was vague; i thought breakin' was something that just happened in the 80s, died out, and saw resurgeance in presentday media.  however, this film gave me insight into a shadowed world of hip-hop and breakdancing, an element of hip hop culture that i see as rich and as pure as rap, scratching and graffiti. sadly enough, the b-boys of yesterday and today don't get much love from society because they were forgotten.  having released this video should change that and i recommend any hardcore bboy fan to purchase this video and add it to their collection. THIS VIDEO IS AWESOME AND TRULY GREAT IN ITS ENTIRETY. FURTHERMORE, THE TAPING OF THIS DOCUMENTARY IS ARTISTIC AND CREATIVE.  MAY BBOYING LIVE FOREVER AND MUCH LOVE TO THE ROCKSTEADY CREW!!!",1040947200,2,795,4.830882352941177
1778957,5,B00006IUIP,"This DVD has special significance to me because I grew up in the West Bronx, right at the epicenter of Hip Hop. I was in high school during the days when Kool Herc was doing his thing and the B-Boy was born. So when I saw that this DVD had clips and interviews of Herc and many of the other innovators I had to have it. Ken Swift really did his homework. Tons of clips of fantastic moves, plenty of interviews and commentary. This is a very comprehensive documentary of what breaking and the B-Boy means to Hip Hop.",1039392000,6,515,4.212121212121212

I was glued from the beginning to the end. I wish they would due a part 2 to this documentary and add the song ""up rock"" by clok to it. That is an incredible breakdancing song.

Footage in this movie is great form the Jams in the Bronx to seeing Kool Herc with giant speakers out of his car ii the 70's. This movie is an instant classic for true hip hop heads.

1778967,3,B00006IUIP,"The beginnings of bboying are covered very well with all the key players, but the international scene (which is at least as big as America's) gets a really superficial pass, as does the modern resurgence.  The history of bboying should also include the present which is poorly represented without really much video or talk of the present greats.  If the movie was ""The Freshest Kids - The Origins of the B-Boy"", it would be a 5-star film, but it falls short on giving a complete history.",1183248000,2,487,4.651162790697675

And to my surprise (and his) I'm in it! As the DVD plays, there are seemingly a hundred still shots of ""jams"" and ""crew pictures"" being faded in and out that give you a glimpse of our attitudes and fashions of the time. If you were there, you may spot some of your peeps. This is one of the most accurate DVDs chronicling the birth of Hip-hop, when it wasn't about the money & bling. The ""artists"" interviewed are telling the real story. A must have for all the aspiring DJ's, MC's, and dancers of today.",1162857600,2,670,4.283464566929134
1778973,5,B00006IUIP,"It amazes me how something like B-boyin' that is so inventive, exhilerating, and positive could have only been in the mainstream media for less than 2 years (circa 1983-1985) but a fad like being a gangster (that is so negative), has been in the mainstream media for nearly 15 years!

1778975,3,B00006IUIP,freshest kid is worth to look at because I did most of what they did when I was a kid growing up. BreaKDANCING was a world wide format which alot of people embraced if you was notice and was good everybody that like breaking would give you mad prop .the crab walk or spider walk was also a breakdancer move because it show how flexible you are when you bunny hop with it. I which it was in the movie because I had a partner from Newyork and we go different club in Miami and girls goes nut over it plus our styles compliment each other. It brought me memory definitely the movie is worth looking at because I have sons and tell them I use to do it but you really have to practice to be really good at it.,1140480000,,704,4.0

But now the DVD will be OURS! What's great about it is that it shows the old 70's/early 80's b-boying stars & clips and then talks to the same people all grown up in their 30's/40's today. You WILL watch this over and over!

I saw firsthand b-boy culture from what i saw on the streets and my interactions with cousins who were in a west coast b-boy crew. This documentary brings you into that world and you are like a silent witness to the birth of something wonderful.

Definitely worth checking out.",1065916800,2,522,4.602150537634409
1778986,5,B00006IUIP,"The first time I saw this, my mind was blown. Seriously, this is by far the best break dancing I have ever seen. Everyone I show this to agrees. This DVD should be mandatory viewing for anoyone claiming to be down with Hip-Hop. If you want to be educated, enthralled, and entertained, buy this now! You will not be disapointed. When I teach my Hip-Hop 101 class. This film, 'Scratch', and 'Style Wars' wills be shown. I am utterly fascinated by this movie. It is an excellent product, outlining the evolution of the B-boy...going back to early 70's NYC, with some incredible archival footage of hot breaking and B-boy battles (including the legendary Lincoln Center battle b/t Rock Steady and Dynamic Rockers in '81!)...You must buy this now.

1778987,5,B00006IUIP,"First and foremost, in a time where Hip Hop culture is mass-marketed on the strength of it's main$tream popularity, you'd be hard pressed to find a true schooler such as myself ready to endorse most of the ""BS"" being pimped today.  That said, just when everyone thought breakin' ""broke"" - the ""boys"" are back!  Being a product of Hip Hop culture as far back as the late 70's, I can honestly say this DVD is worth coppin'.  Remembering too vividly most of the content in this package, the producers did a great job of capturing the B-boy story.  They were also wise to include all those instrumental in B-boy culture and not some ""new jacks"" frontin'. Too often with Hip Hop film, OUR story is watered down like a bad drink and misrepresented.  The unenlightened neglect the ""true schoolers"" and employ ""new schoolers"" to tell a story otherwise reserved for those over 30.  If only for the rare footage of early B-boy masters and memorable media clips, The Freshest Kids is definitely worth the copp.  After viewing this joint, you'll understand why ""boys will B-boys"". --James ""Koe"" Rodriguez",1063238400,2,1092,4.776595744680851

Kids don't really understand how far back hip-hop goes, especially break dancing.  This documentary made me proud to have grown up in that era.  Now all they need is a film on all the old school acts like, The Treacherous 3, Spoonie Gee, Masterdon, Crash Crew, Disco Four, Jimmy Spicer, Furious Five, Cold Crush Brothers, Fearless Four, Soul Sonic Force and yes even the Sugar Hill Gang.  Until Run-DMC popped on the scene in these cats were ""IT.""  Much respect is due these artists.  Thats the stuff I came through middle school and halfway throug high school with.
