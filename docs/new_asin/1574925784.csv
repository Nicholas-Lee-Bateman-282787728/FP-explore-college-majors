195337,4,1574925784,"Mill Creek Entertainment's new R1 DVD has incorrectly stated on the packaging a widescreen format of 1.85:1. This production from the late '90's was conceived and shot in 1.33:1 aspect ratio, which is how TV audiences of the day first saw it and is how it is presented here.
Another gaffe on the DVD case, but this one's just amusing: to go merely by the description on the back, in this version Ahab is ""a man obsessed with vengeance against a menacing beast that *not only stole the lives of his former crew* but continues to haunt him from the sea.""
A deceptive attempt to stoke expectations for the film, perhaps? Or genuine ignorance of the source material?  Who knows?

The menu screen after start-up gives an immediate clue to the film's presentation on the new disc. There are only two options from which to choose: ""Part One"" and ""Part Two"". Ergo, this edition preserves the original miniseries format.
I'm not too crazy about this decision -- I would have preferred a seamlessly edited 3-hour picture without two sets of opening and closing credits, but c'est la guerre.

As to the film itself, there has never been a ""faithful"" adaptation of Melville's masterpiece on film, but how could there be? Maybe a filmmaker as unconventional as, say, Terrence Malick, could come close. Many of the traditional dramatic conventions embraced by this and other renditions might have to be eschewed. What that leaves you with in terms of compelling cinema, though, is a good question. As I post this, Ron Howard's adaptation of Nathaniel Philbrick's ""In the Heart of the Sea"" (about the Essex disaster, which inspired the writing of ""Moby Dick"") is close to its premiere, and may prove the best approach for this kind of material, assuming it'll be more than just another amusement park ride.

This 1998 version is the best, overall. Its budget whale effects were never impressive compared to John Huston's film, and that picture also captured a more convincing flavor for New Bedford whaling. Oswald Morris' scrimshaw hued cinematography is also missed. But Franc Roddam's film is better as a whole, using the expanded run time to fill out the characters. It feels less cursory, less rushed, Christopher Gordon's music is superb, and the performances by Patrick Stewart and Ted Levine are unforgettable. Gregory Peck does better in his cameo as Father Mapple (his last film appearance) than he did as Ahab in Huston's film.

195349,4,1574925784,"Patrick Stewart handles Ahab admirably, and Gregory Peck as the minister giving his blessings and warnings at the outset provides continuity to the version in which he himself played Ahab.

Two points to consider:

1. Queequeg is played with considerable energy and earthy humor, but the actor risks veers close to a ""John Belushi"" homage (which has its own charms).

2. I found the English subtitles (for those of us who need help hearing) contain an unacceptable number of errors - from simple misspellings (e.g., ""thoudsands"" for ""thousands"") to text that appears to be the transcribed notes of a non-native English speaker (as heard by his/her ear and written out by sound).  I highly recommend that Amazon contract with an editor to review the English subtitles, edit appropriately, and that Amazon find a way to insert corrected text.  The errors are so distracting that I would even ask Amazon to send corrected versions to those who request a swap-out (such as myself).",1361750400,,977,5.006172839506172

195352,4,1574925784,"There are several adaptations of Melville's novel available now. I know of two made for TV versions, this miniseries included. It's a wonderful adaptation. I think it also helps knowing that no whales were killed in the making of the film though the models sometimes do look like models. I'm willing to overlook that, however, because of the excellence of the cast and the rest of the production. I gave it 4 starts instead of 5 only because I think the Gregory Peck version that came out in the 50's is still superior. Stewart's version, which includes Peck as Father Mapple - a great nod to his version of Ahab, might be more accessible to a younger audience.",1355011200,,661,4.610169491525424
195353,4,1574925784,"I would say Stewart is acceptable as Ahab, and the narrative has the advantage of including more of Melville's book, but I would think the film equal to the Peck/Huston effort from decades ago. It's a American classic story, obviously, and so it's good to have several interpretations.",1353110400,,285,4.958333333333333
195354,4,1574925784,"Who could every truly do justice to Melville's masterpiece?  Moby Dick is a novel that resists adaptation.  In order to rein it in, one must make sacrifices.  Franc Roddam's for-TV version is arguably the best attempt to present its source material in a digestible way while still preserving the author's intent.

Again, there is always something lost in adaptation, but there is enough here to examine some important themes.  In fact, I teach high-school American literature, and I use this adaptation as a basis to examine themes of God, life and destructive obsession as well as characteristics of Dark Romanticism.  My teenage students are for the most part not prepared to tackle the complexity of the novel, but this adaptation is quite manageable, and it is nice that they typically find it enjoyable as well.

This mini-series was produced for TV in Australia in 1997, and at times it does show its age.  Some of the whaling scenes in particular are not very convincing, and the background scenery at times looks fake.  Still, the effects are quite advanced for 1997, especially for TV, and it doesn't look too bad today.

The Emmy Award-winning soundtrack by Christopher Gordon is outstanding.  It is epic and Wagnerian without becoming tired and repetitive.  Incidentally, the soundtrack alone makes for enjoyable listening, even apart from the context of the film.

Gregory Peck won a Golden Globe Award for his cameo appearance as Father Mapple.  This was his last role, and I am sorry to say that here is where I part ways with most reviewers.  Peck's Father Mapple is too warm, too approachable to do justice to the role.  This is a poignant moment in the novel, introducing the theme of a disinterested God.  A touch more of the fire and brimstone might have helped, but an iciness like the coldness of the sea would have been even better.  Besides, Gregory Peck was a fine actor, but he does not even seem to be trying here.  He could have been reading the part for the first time.  Again, I understand this is not the general consensus, and I welcome any comments to the contrary.

As for the other actors, there are certainly some, well, flawed performances.  In the interest of accentuating the positive, I will not dwell on these flaws.  Suffice to say that by the end of the film, there are certain members of the crew who I was happy to see go down to Davy Jones' locker.

On the other hand, Henry Thomas makes a convincing Ishmael and Ted Levine shines as Starbuck, giving the second-best performance in the film.  Needless to say, Patrick Stewart is perfectly cast as Ahab; his background in Shakespeare coupled with his experience on the small screen lend to his success in this role.  He delivers the Shakespearean monologues sans melodrama, and his effort binds and sustains this film.

It is easy to nitpick any adaptation of Moby Dick.  The 1956 adaptation was too short and featured a too-young Gregory Peck as Ahab.  This adaptation has been criticized for being a long, incohesive mess.  It is important to remember that upon its first printing, the novel itself was heavily panned.  At the end of the day, there is no perfect adaptation of Moby Dick, and there will never be a perfect adaptation of Moby Dick, but if you look here, you will find an exceptional soundtrack, a fair attempt to tackle important themes in the novel and some fine performances.  For what it's worth, I can appreciate that.",1352937600,,3433,4.766101694915254
195355,5,1574925784,"I realize the movie is a few years old but it is a period in time when whaling was high adventure and the men who risked their lives and returned successfully were local heroes. It was hard work and dangerous business. The classic book and movie tells the story of such an adventure. The captain is obsessed with hunting the whale that took his leg. Defying his business owners he leads a crew around the world on his quest, hunting the white whale. I loved the story for the view of a sailors life , the culture and the characters who tried to respect their captain and gave him their faith to lead them. That type of loyalty is no longer easily found in our modern culture. To respect a leader even though he might be a bit crazy they still believed he had their interests at heart.",1345939200,,784,4.304054054054054
195356,5,1574925784,"I was a bit concerned since this version comes out of Korea, but I must say the technical quality of the DVD was fine. it was very easy to turn off the Korean subtitles (I do read Korean and speak it a bit, but I find the subtitles distracting), and from that point on, it was technically a fine DVD.

In terms of the acting, this is my favorite version, with Gregory Peck's version a close second. Peck is more of a smoldering, deep Ahab. Stewart is a fiery, charismatic Ahab. When Quequeg comes out of his death trance and crawls over to Ahab and proclaims, ""Me sabe. You god. You god"" it's totally believable. Stewart has that kind of presence. Even though everyone on board the ship thinks Ahab is crazy, they are willing to follow him to the death. It made me think of the power Adolph Hitler must have had in 1930s Germany.

There are of course a few artistic liberties - variations from Melville's original story. But I do not think any of these detract from the essential story. If you have read Melville, you will enjoy this re-telling. And if you have never waded through Melville's prose, you will find in this version why Moby Dick continues to be a story that is told again, and again, and again. Even if you have the Gregory Peck version (and I hope you do), you will want to buy this one.

I have seen the original 1956 movie and read the book and I must say, this verision holds true to the epic journey and intense obession to both previous incarnations. The visual enhancements allow us a greater view of the bane of Ahab's existance moreso than the '56 movie and therefore allowed us to feel the challenge and terror of facing such a huge beast in it's own element.  Moby Dick's willingness to turn and attack rather than just escape by diving deep, gives it an almost human quality for retribution against those who would do it harm.  Patrick Stewart's Ahab does not appear as ""insane"" as Gregory Peck's, but he is just as intense and in a way, because of that, is a bit more frightening.  Overall, Stewart gave an excellent performance and maintained the story's classic status.",1295049600,7,858,4.662251655629139

Maybe it's the CGI whale. It looks fake and plastic, like a glistening cake of white soap emerging from a tub. Or maybe it's that weird Chinese harpooner who looks like Fu-Man-Chu. Perhaps it is the script, which is -depending on what version you get to see- either too long or too short, and takes too many liberties with the book; hindrances that add little to the plot and only serve to enrage the Melville purists.

Shame, for I think the cast is above average. Patrick Stewart makes a believable Ahab and Henry Thomas a splendid Ishmael. Ted Levine deserves special praise as Mr. Starbuck, and even Piripi Waretini's Queequeg (his annoying ""blahhhh!!!"" notwithstanding) rings true to character.

195365,2,1574925784,"Didn't anyone on the set say, ""You know, that whale's tail is retarded!""?

Moby Dick as a pure adventure story. How sad. Didn't anyone read the book? The deviations in this movie from the book are profound and completely dismast the story's importance. The director seems terrified of injecting mood and irony into his narration. His direction was uncreative and uninspired. What a waste.

Then there are all the sad details. For instance, sorry folks, Queequeg was not Maori. Wrong culture. Yes, believe it or not, the Pacific is full of very different cultures and Maori does not fit the Queequeg character. It's like making Ahab French. I preferred the 1956 Queequeg. Even though he was obviously a white actor, at least his character was indeterminate--as a character from Moby Dick should be. Moby Dick is not a simple adventure story with straightforward characters. And finally, why was this movie so afraid of doing the ending the way Melville conceived it? Probably because they were so deathly afraid of complicated meaning. Please, respect and dignify your audience with something more challenging. We can handle it.

Ted Levine as Starbuck and Hugh Keyes-Burne as Stubb were good cast decisions. The young actor playing Pip did a great job too. Those three, the carpenter and some of the other minor character actors belonged on the boat. The rest should have been thrown overboard, not necessarily for lack of talent, but for being the wrong person for the part. Stewart didn't pull off Ahab. It was a commendable attempt, but he didn't have the focus and moodiness necessary for the part. Stewart is British. That fact still rings through. Ahab in his soul is American. That's one of the major themes of the story. They should stay as close to foundations as possible. Just because he was the commander of the Starship Enterprise shouldn't make him top choice for Captain Ahab.

Henry Thomas was too nice and innocent. Ishmael was the narrator of Moby Dick and the narration of Moby Dick is full of profound insight, intelligence, humor, wit, and biting sarcasm. Ishmael was a character, at least he said so, who could be prone to running around town knocking the hats off people's heads, and he was also not the landlubber this movie portrays him as. He'd been to sea before as a sailor. Why change these kind of details? What were they so afraid of? This movie trashes everything important in the book, including the little details.

But besides that whale's tail, the movie had some good historical recreations that made it worth getting two stars. Now I want to get ahold of a copy of the 1978 version. I read elsewhere that the Ahab portrayal is pretty good in that one. Making a movie of ""Moby Dick,"" though, seems to be as hopeless as hunting the White Whale. I doubt anyone will ever take us on a true brooding Melvillian Nantucket sleigh ride. In the hands of the right talent, though, there's very fertile ground in Moby Dick for a very creative cinematic experience. It's waiting for someone with the highest caliber of talent and insight. Anyone else should lay their hands off it.",1214265600,5,3107,4.810861423220974
195366,1,1574925784,"I rented this remake with high expectations.

I was disappointed.

In four hours, they failed to tell half the story Huston and Bradbury got so perfectly right in the 1956 classic.

Huston's classic is a little dated, particularly in terms of special effects that look like the miniatures they in fact are. While the CGI whale in this remake is a refreshingly-convincing manifestation of a 60-foot sperm whale, it's not Moby Dick.

This movie is bright and colorful, and the whale's just a whale. The cast doesn't come across as seasoned whalers, it feels like actors playing weekend yachtsmen, thanks in no small part to a script that can't seem to respect the intelligence of its audience.

Moby Dick is a dark, slow story of building, brooding menace, which makes the moments of action all the more thrilling and terrifying.

195367,2,1574925784,"I was really disappointed with the movie. I read the book which had its boring parts, but it also had its exciting parts. I felt that the movie just dragged along very slowly. Most of the visuals of the whales are nothing more than a tail or fin. There are some computer generated whales that are shown, but they are far and few between. In one of the final seens where Moby Dick attacks the rest of the crew, you see one of the most ridiculous part of the movie. Moby Dick's tail slams down on each of the boats a few times and you are left to assume that all the crews are dead. It was very repetitive for that scene. I also thought that the movie made Starbuck appear as though he was going mad too, where as, he seemed a little more cool, calm, and collected in the book. Flask was way over acted as well. I think the portrayal of Stubb and Ishmael was very good though. I don't know, you probably can't make this book into a good movie without changing the script a little bit and ""Hollywoodizing"" it. But honestly the book on tape version would probably be more entertaining than this movie.",1202601600,5,1097,4.253588516746412
195368,1,1574925784,"Although Patrick Stewart turns in a riveting and heart-felt performance as the revenge-driven Ahab, there is no denying that this movie stinks as bad as yesterday's blubber.
It's too bad that a project this ambitious could not have been turned over to an old sea salt like James Cameron. Although, truth be told, Cameron probably would have quintupled the budget with his salary alone. The world deserves a modern big screen treatment of this classic tale. Too bad this is what we got.

There is nothing wrong with the acting. Henry Thomas (yes, E.T.'s Henry Thomas) gives a noble performance as Ishmael. Gregory Peck makes a more than worthwhile cameo as the fire and brimstone-spouting Father Mapple. But once the Pequod sets sail, it's time to look for a lifeboat.

For a film that obviously spent a lot of time and money shooting in worldwide locales with first-rate actors on a gorgeous - if not overly decorated - period ship, somebody severely dropped the ball in the post-production department. Dropped the ball, stuck a harpoon in it and then dumped it overboard.

Underwater shots are laughable, computerized sperm whales breach like marlins and the only real special effects prop used (a high school-project whale tail) is about as convincing as a cardboard light-sabre.

The film is hacked together for television commercial inserts and has all the artistic pacing of a spooked horse. The anticlimactic ending turns Ahab's most powerful speech (""From Hell's heart, I stab at thee..."") into an uncomfortable afterthought. And the seventeen dollars that appeared to be left for the special effects make for the most cringe-worthy ship sinking ever put to film.

195371,3,1574925784,"This version certainly does not compare to the other version of Moby Dick, the 1956 version with Gregory Peck starring as the captain bent on revenge. Problems amount with this updated version mainly because it seems to be an attempt at dumbing down or stripping the story to make it more accessible to a wider audience. In making this happen, the producers seemingly beat us over the head with Ishmael's simplicity,  Ahab's madness, Starbuck's reluctance and nonconformity, and Queequeg's cartoonishness. The ultimate result is a version which constructs the story accurately, but in a bare-bones way; we are left without much of the depth that Melville's novel depicts.

Still, with my reservations ( mainly because I do teach English literature), this is a version that does have some entertainment value and certainly gives some accurate information to both the characters and the story. There are some enlightening and funny scenes, such as the first meeting between Ishmael and Queequeg in the sleeping quarters and the scene with Queequeg answering for Ishmael as they board the Pequod. Starbuck's character is successfully depicted as a man who reluctantly goes with the mission of hunting the white whale despite his longing to return safe and sound home. As others have noted, Patrick Stewart illustrates Captain Ahab a little over-the-top in terms of his mental balance, but he does have a certain feel to the Ahab we encounter in the novel: he is quick to judge, narrow-minded, revengeful, and unrelenting, and Stewart embodies all of these characteristics in his portrayal.

Understandably, a two-hour movie cannot illustrate the depth at which the actual book works. We don't really get the chance to scrutinize the magnitude of Ahab's vengeance, his opposition to the laws of nature, and the essence of this futile voyage of revenge. Still, for what its worth, this film does have some credibility and merit, and certainly can be used as a tool for both Melville and the novel itself. And, if those aren't your cup of tea, it still has entertainment and moments that make it worthy of viewing. This is Moby Dick and Melville, but stripped a bit down.

195372,3,1574925784,"My American Lit class had reached Civil War era literature toward the end of the semester.  While I wanted to give them a taste of Melville's classic novel, there was no way they would be able to read a 600 page book in time for the final; so I decided to show the DVD instead.  I originally wanted to show the Gregory Peck version, but our school's Media Center only had Patrick Stewart version.  I had asked a fellow colleague about showing this DVD, and she said she had a positive experience with it when she showed it to her students the previous year.

Well, while I can't say it was a horrible experience (Students were, by and large, attentive to the movie), it wasn't particularly well done. The acting was uneven: Queequeg and Father Mapple (played by Peck in a cameo role) were very good, but the other characters weren't overly convincing.  The most surprising part of the DVD, however, was how poor the special effects were.  Given today's technology, I had expected more than a fake-looking tail and the same rubber hump coming out of the water over and over again.  Even the kids found these ""effects"" laughable.

The opening scenes of the DVD were actually quite good.  The kids found it humorous when Ishmael suddenly finds out that he is to share his room (and his bed) with the menacing looking Queequeg.  This part of the DVD compares favorably with the Peck version, but it's all downhill from there.

The bulk of the blame rests on Patrick Stewart's portrayal of Ahab.  Other reviewers have lambasted his performance, and while I can't say it was terrible, he doesn't have the charismatic malevolence to pull it off.  The Audience wonders how someone so unconvincing can suck the Pequod's crew down into his own madness; therefore, the acting becomes artificial and the Audience, rather than imagining being part of the story, remains a distant observer.  Starbuck, too, seemed more confrontational than I remember when I read ""Moby Dick"" in college.  Secondary characters (Flask, Tashtengo, Dagoo) were almost non-existant; by that, I mean if you hadn't read the book, you wouldn't know who they were in the DVD. There were also certain scenes I didn't care too much for (Trapped in the Artic ice; Storm with St. Elmo's fire), but overall, a decent movie.

Definitely, a VERY difficult book to adapt.  Director did keep as much action as possible, so my students weren't bored with the movie, but if I had to do it all over again, I much prefer the Gregory Peck version (which I recently viewed).  Your money is better served buying THAT version rather than this one.",1146700800,6,2590,4.7305122494432075
195373,1,1574925784,"It's always interesting to watch actors in their attempts to overcome the stigma of being typecast.  I suppose it is a serious problem.  After all, apocryphal accounts abound about actors who, having played a too memorable part in a movie, such as the woman who played the Wicked Witch of the West in the Wizard of Oz, end up unemployed because no one can see them as anything else.

Enter Patrick Stewart. Of late he has thrown himself at such improbable and botched roles as Henry II in a remake of THE LION IN WINTER and Ebenezer Scrooge in A CHRISTMAS CAROL. As bad as these two mistakes were, neither comes remotely close to his misguided decision to assume the role of Ahab in the new MOBY DICK. What emerges is failure before the opening credits have even run their course. I've said it before; you just cannot remake or replace perfection. Gregory Peck's masterful portrayal of Ahab in the 1956 production of MOBY DICK set a standard that has become a generic when discussing or considering the character of Ahab. Period! As good an actor as Stewart can be, as evidenced by his character-defining work in STAR TREK and his portrayal of a Western King Lear in KING OF TEXAS, he just doesn't even come close to pulling it off here. Instead his performance is totally laughable if not consummately pathetic!

I hope that this is the last attempt to supplant the original.  Mr. Stewart needs to take a deep breath and accept that he just isn't fit to remake every classic role under the sun. And when it comes to this story, and there's certainly no shame in admitting it, it's a big peg leg to fill!

195374,4,1574925784,"Note: This review is by a high school English Teacher.

When the time came for my students to see a film version of ""Moby Dick,"" I bought both the 1950's film and this one on DVD.  After watching both of them carefully, I decided that this newer offering would have much more appeal to my students than the older film.

I seem to have been right, and I think it is safe to say that the 1950's film can now be retired, except for film buffs and the curious.

I especially liked the fact that the American Indian and South Sea Island characters in this film were actually played by people who appear to be part of those societies.  In the 1950's film, they are played by what looks to be white factory workers from upstate New York wearing lots of makeup.  This would have been very annoying and distracting to my diverse group of students.

As for other reviewers' comments about Patrick Stewart's performance, my feeling is that he nailed it.  As Starbuck says, ""to seek revenge against a dumb brute that only bit thee out of blindest instinct is blasphemy...""  Ahab is someone who sees the idea of resigning oneself to a negative twist of fate as repellant.  He is someone who would rather burn to a crisp than ask a higher power for rain.  The thing that drives him isn't just obsession; it is rebellion against the infinite.

In psychological terms, Ahab gave all of his power to the whale, and enslaved his life and destiny to it when it was not rationally necessary for him to do so.  He is like a small child who has had his lollipop taken away, and who has thrown himself on the floor, absolutely determined to be inconsolable by anything or anyone.  Stewart captures that aspect of Ahab perfectly, and it led to some very constructive paper writing and classroom discussion.

I only withhold the fifth star because I wish this film was a longer ""Director's Cut"" version, covering more of the book than it currently does.",1133136000,41,1928,4.515850144092219
195375,2,1574925784,"One of the problems with Moby Dick as a novel is that it is more of a philosophical essay rather than a straight narative.  Of the 133 chapters, only the last two chapters as well as the first few, tell the very famous story of the chasing of the white whale.  Melville is less interested in character development than commentary making it a very difficult and complex read to truly absorb the entire message.  The point is, this is NOT an easy book to make into a film.

 In this latest version, Patrick Stewart takes the helm, not as Captain Pickard of Star Trek, but the famous Captain Ahab.  Unfortunately, the producers obviously told Mr. Stewart that Captain Ahab is chasing after a great white ham and he must play it accordingly.  Stewart the loyal actor, takes the advice, and hams it up so badly that the film is almost unwatchable.  On top of that, nothing new is added to this version but you may not notice that since Stewart's performance gets so much in the way of everything else, that he makes William Shatner seem like an understated actor.

  About the only highlight is Gregory Peck (who makes a great cameo in this version as the minister) appears.  Peck more properly captured the bitter, somber obsession of Ahab in the 1956 version as compared to Stewart who never seems to really know how to play this part.  It's unfortunate because Stewart really can act, but I suspect ego may have gotten in the way of this one!

  Finally let me not put the entire blaim on Stewart.  The reality is that this version just doesn't work and I can't blaim the production team too much as Moby Dick is a brutally hard novel to bring to the screen.",1127520000,11,1656,4.48494983277592

Captain Ahab(Patrick Stewart)is a man that is waging a constant war with his inner demons eversince the day that his leg was bit off by his arch Nemesis Moby Dick. Believing Moby Dick to be satan in disguise, and he, Ahab, Gods own avenger against such a creature. Ahab charters a ship, whose crew must unknowinly follow Ahab on his journey through the hellish darkness of his madness.

There is one man who dares to defy the utter madness of Ahab, and that is Starbuck(Ted Levine) who pleads with Ahab to forgo his passion for revenge. The Quaker in him being struck senseless by such a blasphemous outrage against God and nature.

It is a mariners tale of men against nature, and forces that he cannot, and should not try and control. It is a story of how deep one man's madness can influence others. It is a tale of one's man desire to become a god, to hold the life and death of a scant few people in the palm of his hand.

But his madness does not lead him to glory, or even the menial triumph of his victory. Instead, it leads him and his crew to a watery grave, Ahabs lust for revenge nothing more than a death sentance for those that needed not die. A wonderful, but sad movie nevertheless.

I did give it 4 stars however because the creaters of this version were tastful enough to give Gregory Peck a guest appearance as Father Mapple which He did this role just as stern and feirce and hard as when He played Captain Ahab in the orriginal... which was perfect!

Still though, it is worth getting this movie, as I stated, Patrick Stewart does an excellent job saving the movie and also brings out a differant side of Ahab with out ruining it, just more less enhancing a side We haven't seen so to speak, because He is still hard and sea-battered tough at times just like Gregory Peck was in the original when the part called for it...

195381,2,1574925784,"Gee, it started out so well; this version of Herman Mehlville's classic novel of obsession and revenge begins with an earnestness that suggests it might actually do justice to it's literary inspiration.  But unfortunately, that is not to be the case.  The inherent problem with bringing Moby Dick to the screen is that the book is such a massive work that combines sea-going adventure and complex characters with an almost textbook discussion of whales and their habits.  Whether you've read the book or not, you are probably aware of the story.  A young wanderer signs on to a whaling expedition under the command of a legendary captain seeking to avenge his maiming by a a white whale.  John Huston made a semi-classic version in 1956 that succeeded far better than this despite one of the few so so performances by Gregory Peck.
The problem with this particular production is that it suffers from a bad case of ""mini-series syndrome"" -- a headline actor, plenty of time to tell the story and a limited budget to work with.  Patrick Stewart certainly does his part.  As Captain Ahab he displays a range of psychotic emotion that somehow eluded Gregory Peck in the '56 version (one of Peck's few disappointing performances).  Ahab is a difficult character to portray without going over the top, but Stewart succeeds, quickly banishing the viewer's expectations to hear him refer to the First Mate Starbuck as ""Number One"" or issuing an order to ""make it so"" ala his alter ego Captain Jean-Luc Picard.  Stewart's Ahab is as scared psychologicaly as he is physically.  But in Stewart's hands you can somewhat understand the sailing and leadership ability of Ahab while bemoaning the course of destruction that he is pursuing.
Another actor that stands out is Piripi Waretini in the role of Queequeg.  His portrayal is far more enigmatic than the almost cartoonish ""savage"" portrayed in the earlier movie.  But from there the quality of performance by the remaining cast drops precipitously.  Henry Thomas is okay as Ishmael, however Ted Levine as the ill-fated Starbuck seems to be acting with his jaw wired shut.  Mr. Peck is wasted in the almost cameo role of Father Mapple.
Ironically, the seagoing visuals of the older film are far superior to those of this more digitized version.  While the whale is more believable, the shipboard storm scenes look like they were filmed at a movie studio theme park, and sadly, they get worse as the film progresses.  Was there a problem with the budget?

If you have read the book, It's hard to stomach, if not, you may very well enjoy this as a movie.  The problem is that the movie is dishonest to the book not only in plot, but in character, symbolism, and basically all major themes.  Passages from the book are borrowed with no surrounding context, becoming meaningless but impressive-sounding speeches.  Meaningful characters, events, and symbols are changed into shallow plot devices.  It's not the chinese boat crew, it's not Queequeg's hair, it's not even the curious sidetrip to antarctica (???), it's that important elements of the book are mercilessly twisted into interesting screen shots or one liners that look or sound deep, but are either meaningless in the context of the movie or, worse yet, entirely change the meaning into something other than Melville's.  The main problem with this movie is the title - for it is a false Moby Dick.  It's an entertaining film in its own right, although certainly with many problems (like said line which are impressive but without context) but it is Moby dick in neither plot nor theme.

Franc Roddam's version of Moby Dick is not a remake of Huston's highly overrated film. To say so is like saying that Herman Mellville didn't write the book. This movie is better than most other made-for-cable flicks I've seen, and though it is not without its flaws, it has more dramatic punch and stronger performances than the Huston version. Gregory Peck can be a teriffic actor (To Kill a Mockingbird), but Ahab is far from being his greatest performance, let alone among his greatest roles. It's one of his worst, in fact. Come on, who would believe Ahab as an enemic, muttering (and as Pauline Kael put it) stock company Lincoln? Patrick Stewart is much more convincing in the role, and puts more energy into his work. Roddam changes the sequence of events in the book, but it's told in more detail and is truer to Mellville's book, whereas Huston skims over the material and leaves us with a rushed and unsatisfying story (people who say it is much more faithful to the novel have either never read it, or are relying on what they read from some abridged junior edition).
