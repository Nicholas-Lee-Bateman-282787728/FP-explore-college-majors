8169254,2,B00007AJET,Some of the special effects in the movie are great I will give it that but the majority of the movie is extremely boring.  The first 60 minutes are dreadful to sit through- you can almost just fast forward to the last 15 min of the movie and you will not miss out on anything.,1214784000,,276,4.0181818181818185
8169255,1,B00007AJET,"[...]just...the only thing that kept me from turning off the dvd
was my own sick curiousity of how the filmmakers were
going to finish what they started. [...]Things that were worth seeing: 1. The dismembered girl hanging
from the tree.  2. The chainsaw scene with all the blood just
spraying up at the killer(good laugh there). and 3. The half
naked girl walking down the train tracks.  Well, I have to
admit the 1st dream sequence was alright, but still way too drawn out.
Now, one cannot tell me I don't like it because it's a low budget
feature when I've seen some low budget horror films that were
VERY good.  Ex. The Evil Dead and Phantasm were both awesome
films, despite their low budgets, and neither made me want to
fall asleep when I first saw them.
On the other hand, Massacre wasn't as bad as The Howling 8 or 9
or which ever that last [...] one was.  Now that is
by far the worst horror movie I've ever see.  Massacre comes in
third, after I, Zombie.
Only the filmmakers could truly enjoy this film.

8169256,5,B00007AJET,"OK, first of all, I was the Visual Effects Supervisor for the film, originally called ""Bikini Party Massacre"" and shortened to ""Massacre"" for the US release. So my review is more than just a bit biased, but the reviews are in and I couldn't agree more. Massacre will satisfy the people whom it was created for - and created by for that matter. You can tell the crew had a great time shooting it (we did) and the talent enjoyed the gig as well. ...It's a really clever script wrapped around a fun little film. The Directors Commentary is enjoyable. Fans of low-budget films with higher than average production values will not be disappointed.",1039046400,2,641,4.631578947368421
