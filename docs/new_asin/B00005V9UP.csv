8533116,5,B00005V9UP,"Ignore the other reviewer. Fred Heeren is a very intelligent and funny man. Apparently this humor was lost on the other reviewer. This tape is pretty short one, but it is full of information provided by respected ""secular"" scientists in relatively short interview snippets. I found several intriguing ideas among these interviews. Do not expect this little tape to answer all your questions, it is simply a pretty good place to start. For example, someone who knows nothing about modern cosmology would find much of value on this 30 minute tape. God bless Fred Heeren!",1482278400,,568,4.989473684210527
