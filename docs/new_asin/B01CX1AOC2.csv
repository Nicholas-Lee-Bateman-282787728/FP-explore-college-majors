7694660,4,B01CX1AOC2,"Good disaster movie that unfortunately has more than it's share of American cliches (brooding teen, marital stress, lone hero trying desperately to convince authorities disaster is ahead) and a few moments of just plain stupidity (dopey reaction when woman is trapped between 2 cars while flood waters rise). I liked it but was disappointed in predictability.",1466726400,2,359,5.428571428571429
7694661,5,B01CX1AOC2,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

Ive been a fan of natural disaster flicks ever since I was a kid.  I think this stems from the fact my parents made me watch EARTHQUAKE at a young age.  I was then subjected to other disaster films like THE TOWERING INFERNO and THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE.  These old school classics are a lot of fun, and they have paved the way for newer favorites, such as 2012 and SAN ANDREAS.  I recently had the pleasure of watching an excellent disaster film called THE WAVE.  Just like its predecessors, this movie is a gut-wrenching look at what Mother Nature could potentially release upon civilization at any time.  But whereas its brethren focus more on the disaster itself, THE WAVE uses the disaster as a backdrop and instead looks at the people it damages, both mentally and physically.  The result is a gripping and powerful film that is rife with tension and terror.

Its been a while since a film literally made me hold my breath because of its intensity.  I did just that during the ten-minute countdown, as the wave makes its way to Geiranger.  I didn't even realize I was doing it until I exhaled a long, ragged breath.  The way the film sucks you in is almost intoxicating.

THE WAVE is shot very well and contains some of the most beautiful visuals of any film Ive seen so far this year.  The HD picture of the Blu-ray captures the scenery with vibrant detail, and the camerawork captures the breathtaking landscape for a truly mesmerizing onscreen image.

The acting is also very good.  I have never heard of any of the cast, however they all do a fine job in their roles.  Kristoffer Joner plays the lead, Kristian, and he is supported by Ane Dahl Torp, who portrays his wife, Idun (horror fans will recognize Dahl Torp as Sara from the awesome zombie flick, DEAD SNOW).  I love the onscreen chemistry these two share, as it is very evident and believable.  They are joined by a great cast that includes Jonas Hoff Oftebro, Edith Haagenrud-Sande, and Fridtjov Saheim.

The special effects are excellent, and they help to enhance the intensity of the plot.  I don't think this film would be as powerful if the effects were not so good.  Thanks to Dolby Atmos Sound Technology, the wave crashes to life in ear-shattering full surround sound, lending more credibility to the realism of the film.

THE WAVE is a huge win for me, and I highly recommend it.  The film is from Norway, therefore be ready to read subtitles (I would steer clear of the English duboverits not very good).  But don't worry:  the subtitles do not take away from the film at all.  Strap in for this one, and be ready to enjoy yourself.",1466726400,10,2681,4.542797494780793
7694662,5,B01CX1AOC2,"I think the challenge for any film of this genre is developing characters the viewer cares about.  -and that's what distinguishes this film as excellent.  This was to be Kristian's last day at work at the warning center, but there's stuff going on, ominous signs not quite to the threshold of hitting the alarm.  -and the tension builds. It's creepy and well-paced.  Kristian and his family are a very believable and likable group.  You really hope they survive this catastrophe, but no spoilers here.  It's a very entertaining film",1466553600,4,532,4.921348314606742
7694663,4,B01CX1AOC2,"I came to the 2015 film ""The Wave"" by accident one Friday eve after a miserable week at work. Sat down with a couple of glasses of wine and discovered as enjoyable a movie experience as I've had in a while. It is far superior to recent disaster films&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Day-After-Tomorrow-Blu-ray/dp/B000VDDWE2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Day After Tomorrow [Blu-ray</a>] and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/San-Andreas-Special-Edition-DVD/dp/B00YHRMMLC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">San Andreas (Special Edition DVD)</a>&nbsp;because it is far more plausible. Alaska's Lituya Bay had just such a wave in 1958, in fact the largest tsunami ever recorded.

While watching ""The Wave,"" I was reminded of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dante-s-Peak-Blu-ray/dp/B004XC5LP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dante's Peak [Blu-ray</a>], a good 1997 film taking place in a picturesque rural locale of the Pacific Northwest. But that town (even if Linda Hamilton was the mayor) has nothing on Norway's Geiranger, with absolutely breathtaking scenery. Please note, this is a Norwegian film with subtitles. But the family dramas, the regular workday of the father and eventually the fight for survival will be instantly identifiable to American audiences. ""The Wave"" is a universal film to be enjoyed by all.

I loved the family, so decent and likable. Kristoffer Joner plays father Kristian, young, Bohemian, with a gig at the local station that monitors potential rock slides. In the community of Geiranger, a rock slide would mean a deadly wave that could destroy the entire town. He and his colorful co-workers are storm chasers of sorts, preparing to raise the alarm the instant such a slide takes place for the town's evacuation. And a rock does eventually slide, and does the wave ever come.

Kristian's wife works at the local resort hotel, and when the alarm goes off, the hair will raise on the back of your neck. The only fault for me was a final scene of resurrection that was almost identical to the famous scene in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Abyss-The-director-Cut-Ac3/dp/B00008G8LY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Abyss, The (director Cut Ac3)</a>. If you're going to attempt to pull it off, the scene needs to be reworked so as not to be so predictable.

Anyway, ""The Wave"" is an American genre film almost perfectly executed by Norwegian filmmakers. The special effects are superb, the action intimate and the drama legitimate. You care about these people and you are invested in their survival. The only villain in ""The Wave"" is Mother Nature, and she's as scary as Godzilla.",1465257600,18,2763,6.150259067357513
7694664,5,B01CX1AOC2,Excellent film which I just had the chance to see at a local theater (foreign film night). The characters are developed and not the 2-dimensional fodder one normally expects in disaster movies. The camera work is extremely impressive. Best of all - from the view of a science nerd such as myself - the science aspects are nearly all spot-on (don't let the poor choice of cover photo as shown here fool you... the tsunami looks like a tsunami should).,1460592000,26,450,4.6375

7694667,5,B01CX1AOC2,"No doubt, this is the first Norwegian film I have ever seen. I don't imagine Norway produces many motion pictures so it was great to see THE WAVE. I had read about it and was glad to see it was finally available on DVD.

First of all, just the scenery will entice the viewer. The beautiful fijords and small villages. It makes me want to visit this lovely country. THE WAVE might be one of Norway's first ""Hollywood-style"" epics. It was mentioned this is the first disaster film from Norway. THE WAVE might be somewhat of a typical natural disaster film. There seems to be something strange and ominous happening and could the mountain plates be shifting? A 1905 disaster where a huge portion of a mountain fell into the ocean and caused a tsunami is referenced. Who would expect a huge tidal wave in Norway?

The actors are great and even if the story is predictable, no one can resist the scenery and the suspense. Here is an engrossing disaster film from beautiful Norway that is worth viewing",1498176000,2,996,4.558659217877095
7694668,2,B01CX1AOC2,There's not much destruction shown. You'll only see the wave for about a minute and it looks fake. I was excited to see this movie since I loved the Directors movie Cold Prey 1 & 2 (Norway's Halloween)...check those out!!!,1496707200,,222,4.575

7694670,3,B01CX1AOC2,"no better, or worse, no more, or less realistic than any Charlton Heston disaster movie filmed on a Universal set; plenty of moments of ""I told you so"" but no outright dislikable characters, just those genuinely confused acting irrationally against overwhelming odds. Too bad I didn't care if any of them lived or died. The full on multichannel sound wasn't good enough to annoy the neighbors. Subtitles matched the English dub, but the voice sync seemed to be a tad off, which might have added to the emotional disconnect - also the Anglocentric conceit that there being five million Norwegian speakers and 510 million English speakers, there should have been of more concern about it for international marketing.",1491436800,,714,5.059322033898305

7694676,3,B01CX1AOC2,"This a Norwegian movie (well most of it was shot in a sound studio in Romania) ,is not based on a true story that has happened, but one they tell us most scientists agree will in the future.  Basically a scenic tourist town sits at the bottom of a steep gorge on the shores of a fjord that also shares its circumference with a huge fragile rock that when it collapses into the fjord, will cause an 80 meter high powerful wave which will wipe out the Norwegian town.  The wave will take exactly ten minutes from when the rock drops into the fjord to engulf the town.

If you can, try and get a version that has English subtitles and the soundtrack still in the original Norwegian language.  The region 4 (Australian) edition has really bad dubbing where the characters speak every line shouting like they are in an 80's Japanamation Saturday morning cartoon the whole movie.  When we first come upon the family the dad is doing something with the pipe under the sink while the daughter is sitting at the table doing homework.  I'm sure in Norwegian it's a normal voice quiet calm family conversation, but with the dubbed in English actors it's like they are preparing for a battle against each other about to use giant robots or something.

The movie is let down by the fact it uses the exact same build up plot that many made for TV tidal wave movies do (I don't think this was made for TV though), it has an expert who works in the research station, due to tremors and recent events, realising the drop of the rock in this case is pretty likely, and the destructive wave is about to roll in.  Of course all the other highly trained experts think he's being paranoid and dismiss his claims.  You even have the whole I'm not going to evacuate a town at the start of tourist season line.  What makes this even more ridiculous is that even though he has a feeling the rock is about to drop as he and his kids are to board a ferry to another part of Norway, he doesn't tell them to get on the ferry to safety and meet up with him later.  Clearly the son (although granted we do find out he isn't the brightest later in the movie) is old enough to look after the younger daughter for a few days and the risk of them dying from stranger in a motel is significantly less than a giant powerful wave.  He doesn't even leave them at the higher altitude research station where he used to work, but takes them down the fjord water level where he lets the son stay at the motel the mother is working at overnight while he goes back to his old house with the daughter for the night (and why are all their possessions and furniture in a skip?  I get it might cost too much for removalists from one small town to an oil rig or wherever they are moving to, but surely they could have sold these items, or given them to neighbours or charity).

Anyway this movie follows events of the Wave's arrival following just two residents.  The father with his daughter at home when the waveraid siren blares, and his wife who is the night manager or something at the hotel in town. We don't experience events through any other characters, unlike most disaster flicks that show many characters ones we've met and heaps of extras we haven't fighting for survival.  So being neither are out on the street when the wave arrives, we don't actually see any wave hitting destruction action, we just get the rising water as the fjord water looks for somewhere to go and rising chases each of them.  We then see the aftermath as the dad tries to find the wife to know what happened to her and his son but not a lot of fleeing for lives action.  What we do see with the fleeing action to me doesn't seem to realistic, there's not really any self preservation who cares about everyone else occurring (well except for from the mother) that we see occur in real life moments of terror such as people being trampled to death.  The Wave has cars driving up a one lane road, and not one driver when the cars come to a standstill decides, even with the water in the rear view mirrors, to drive on the incorrect side of the road even though that lane isn't likely to have anyone using it coming down the mountain.

The mother and son aren't exactly the most likable characters either.  Spoilers - A man doesn't board the supposed safety of a bus to help the mother look for her son, his wife is likely dead due to helping, and she never once when in the bomb shelter even acknowledges their sacrifice or thanks the man or tells the son to. Simply taking the time to grab his shoulders or something and thank him might have snapped him temporarily out of it where he could be more help.  Yet she just demands he take of his jacket when he's obviously in grieving shock and is completely rude to him the whole time.

You would hope the town in real life has an automatic alarm sounding computer system that sounds when the data on the screen gets to the point it should rather than just flashing a graphic in red on and off over and over again so a half asleep employee will get up and eventually push it.",1484784000,,5058,4.329100529100529

7694686,4,B01CX1AOC2,"I'm actually going 4.5 for this Norwegian first attempt at a disaster movie. Many years ago in Norway along a fjord, part of a mountain collapsed and caused a tidal wave that wiped out the town of Geiranger. Well, experts are predicting that it will happen again and soon. But they had rebuilt the town and there are folks living there. This is the story of when it happens again. One of the local seismologists sees an impending problem and tries to warn everyone....but you get it. I have to say except for the dumb son who in my opinion caused a few deaths, I loved this move and the actors and the performances. I have left some things out because I don't want to ruin it but I will say the wave looks terrific and very scary. Kudos to the cast, the writers, the director etc. I watched it in the original Norwegian with the sub-titles, that is how I watch all my foreign movies, no dubbing for me!",1478908800,,902,4.311764705882353
7694687,5,B01CX1AOC2,Wonderful film,1478304000,,14,6.5
7694688,5,B01CX1AOC2,"Possible spoilers.  Hollywood has produced an unending supply of disaster movies.  If Mother Nature has a way to raise hell, filmmakers have found a way to amplify and show its potential devastation.  Weve seen tornadoes, hurricanes, tidal waves, landslides, earthquakes, floods, you name it.  Now Norway has gotten into the act with this seemingly realistic portrayal of something I had never thought much about.  Evidently the country has hundreds of mountains (once glaciers) which are ready to break apart at any time.

The picturesque town of Geiranger sits at the end of a fjord alongside Akerneset, an unstable mountain.  In 1905 and again in the 1930's, the mountain dropped tons of rock into the water creating a huge tsunamis that wiped out the town and killed hundreds.  So now geologists have set up sensors to monitor the constant mountain movement.  Kristian (Kristoffer Joner) is one of the geologists assigned to the monitoring station, but he has just accepted a new white collar job working for an oil company requiring that he move, along with his wife Idun (Ane Dahl Torp), teenage son, Sondre (Jonas Hoff Oftebro) and 10-year old Julia (Edith Haagenrud-Sande).

After an informal goodbye party at the station with his co-workers, he notices some minor irregularities in some of the readings.  The supervisor, Arvid (Fridtjov Saheim) promises to keep an eye on them and Kristian departs to pick up his son and daughter to take the next ferry to the mainland.  Idun is taking her final shift as the night manager at the local hotel.  Enroute, Kristains scientific intuition takes over and he stops one last time to take another look.  With a co-worker, they climb down into the crevice to check the monitors, and discover the wires to a pair of sensors had been severed by the mountains movement.

In the meantime the 2 kids have found their way to the hotel, with Kristian joining later.  In a key story element, the last ferry has departed so they need to spend another night in town.  Young Julia wants to go say goodbye to her old house, now essentially empty.  Sondre gets his own hotel room for the night.  So the family is split up with Dad and daughter spending the night in their old house and Mom and son in the cozy hotel.

When Kristian checks in with the monitoring station, he finds that the mountain is contracting rather than constricting (I think I have that right).  It seems unusual because, the science suggests danger comes with constriction.  But obviously they hadnt studied the old geology books written about such things.  Kristian digs one up and determines that isn't the case.  This is confusing point only in that, shouldnt they have already known about this?

This first half of the movie is beautifully constructed.  Director Roar Uthaug (Escape and soon to direct the new Tomb Raider) carefully guides us through the relationship with the family, while at the same time building the tension which precedes what we know is coming.  And when it comes its a doozy.  Once the rock slides hit the water, the town has 10 minutes to evacuate before the giant wall of water engulfs it.  With the warning sirens wailing, Kristian and Julia head their Jeep to higher ground, only to get stuck in traffic.  Relegated to walking and running, Kristian hands Julia off to a friend in order to help a woman pinned between cars.  Unable to go any further, Kristian and the woman get inside a car, buckle up and hope for the best.

The film is surprisingly presented with a Dolby Atmos soundtrack which defaults to Dolby TrueHD 7.1 and wow, what a sonic thrill.  The photography is first rate throughout the film ranging from the beautiful landscapes of Norway to the harrowing results of the wave.  Back in town, things aren't going well either.  A bus loads up the tourists and heads uphill.  Idun stays behind with another couple to look for Sondre, who wasn't in his room.  There always seems to be a dumb teenager in these movies and Sondre had decided to go into the basement to plug in his earbuds and skateboard.  Once hes found, its too late.  The bus is gone and the wave is upon them.  They head to the basement bomb shelter where they are trapped in a rapidly flooding room.  Time is running out.  Kristian somehow survives his ordeal and decides to head back to town to find his family only to find the waves destruction everywhere.  Will he find his wife and son?

There are a couple things that elevate this film from the usual stuff we see (both the good and the not so good).  First, the film is very realistic.  There is no over dramatization or hyped destruction.  It is based on historical evidence.  The film has great balance.  The characters are fully realized.  The families are authentic, with real issues embraced with devotion to each other.  The tension is genuine and builds slowly and finally the film has some excellent action sequences.  I actually went back and watched some of the sequences again right after finishing it.  Highly recommended.

In addition to one of the best sounding movies Ive seen and heard, it also has a perfect musical score by Magnus Beite.  And yes, your sub(s) will get a tsunamic workout, but listen for the aftereffects as well.  The leaking water, the sudden rush of water, and then the dissipation.  It is truly an enveloping soundtrack.  As noted earlier, the movie has an authentic feel to it and that goes for the video presentation as well.  We don't get eye-popping colors and much of the film is greys and browns, emblematic of the waves aftermath and underwater scenes.  This isn't a criticism, but a testimony to the cinematographer John Rosenlund, getting it right.  The transfer comes in 1080p resolution and a 2.39:1 aspect ratio, the same as the theatrical presentation.  In addition to the Norwegian Atmos and TrueHD 7.1 options, there is a Dolby TrueHD 5.1 option with dubbed English.  I would note that the subtitles (English and Spanish) are easy to read and keep up with, so go with the Atmos/7.1 option.  There is also an English SDH option.  Extras include 3 short pieces that breakdown the Wave visual effects, an interview with Roar Uthuag, a trailer and some previews from Magnolia Home Entertainment.",1478044800,,6221,4.770384254920337

If you grew up in the seventies then you are well acquainted with the genre known as the disaster film. Oh sure, there were disaster movies made in the past featuring earthquakes and hurricanes. But in the seventies there were movies made that featured that as he main them with stories surrounding the disaster. THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, THE TOWERING INFERNO, ROLLERCOASTER, METEOR, AIRPORT (1-4), THE HINDENBERG and EARTHQUAKE which not only depicted a disaster but featured special speaker systems in theaters to shake the seats due to volume and overuse of bass. It was the heyday of disaster films. When I read that a new disaster film was coming out on DVD I was interested. Id enjoyed the ones from the past and was anxious to see how this one was. I wasn't disappointed.

THE WAVE comes to us via Norway. Yes there are films being made outside of the U.S., start looking at them. The movie tells the story of a small village in Norway located in the Geiranger fjord in Norway that was flooded years ago when the side of the mountain slid down and created a tsunami as it crashed into the lake. Since that time seismic monitors have been in place to track the mountainside with an alert system in place to make sure people know if it ever happens again. If the horns sound you have ten minutes to leave before the wave strikes.

Geologist Kristian Eikjord has been a part of that team for years now. He and his family are right in the middle of leaving this town as he takes on a new job elsewhere. The last day he notices something odd but cant quite put his finger on it. He returns home and begins final preparations for the move as his wife heads to work for her last night at the local hotel.

About this same time the team notices something strange is happening. A camera shows one thing but the instruments show another. Of course it ends up being a faulty system that fails to let them know the mountain has shifted considerably and the end result will be another tsunami in the making. They contact Kristian to see what they can do when their leader is lost and he sets out to move his family and anyone else.

As the sirens go off the townspeople head to the hills, literally, to escape the oncoming wave. Kristian drives there with his daughter but his wife and son are still in the hotel. As he attempts to rescue more people trapped on the hillside in a traffic jam he has no idea if the rest of his family is safe or not. Leaving his daughter with a friend he sets out to rescue them as well.

The movie is perfect for fans of the genre. We have the set-up for the disaster, the payoff with some great looking visual effects and a story that draws you in with a family to root for. Sure you might wonder why they didn't check the equipment more often knowing the importance it had in the protection of this town but face it, budget cutbacks take place around the world. Instead push those moments of questionable logic aside and enjoy the movie.

The acting is well played by all involved and Id love to say its standard for each of them but as I said at the start, this movie was made in Norway and honestly Im not familiar with their actors. Should any of them make the move to Hollywood my guess is theyll be headed to the top of the list after watching their performances here. And while Norway may not be as big as Hollywood it hasn't stopped them from creating a movie that draws you in and has you rooting for the people of this village long before the actual wave hits. And no, that isn't a spoiler. If you didn't think it would hit after seeing the title of the film you weren't paying attention.

Ive said before that more people need to make the effort to watch foreign films to get a glimpse of what the world has to offer. This one makes it easy with an English speaking soundtrack. It lets you know that there is a wide world of film out there and not all of those foreign films are what some fear, the boogie man known as art films. So take a chance and watch this one and discover how disaster movies can draw you in, have you sad at various moments, cheering at others and rooting for characters youve just met. THE WAVE is a movie that just may make you change your mind about foreign films.",1470700800,2,4284,4.332917705735661

7694714,1,B01CX1AOC2,"What Wave?

Oh, the one that shows up for a five minute scene and does next to nothing? Oh, that one? That's what this near two-hour long film is about?

Yeah, so I expected this to be about a giant wave that destroys a bunch of stuff, but what this movie actually is, is that of a family drama in which daddy is having a hard time connecting with his douche son and marital woes are hinted at. As the story plods along and science-jabber about plates, the Earth, quakes and what not take up a lot of the screen time, the movie finally gets to the star of the show: the wave. And in about five minutes (only about one minute of actual wave on-screen time), it's all over. AND THIS IS JUST THE HALFWAY POINT OF THE MOVIE.

If you're going to sink a massive budget into a CGI wave of destruction, at least provide some sequences of destruction! Nope, not here. Instead, what we get is one scene where the wave hits some cars on a ridge and another where it bursts through the entrance of a hotel. NOTHING MORE. The movie spends so much time developing the inevitable wave like some villain only to have it come and go like a shrug. There's no scale to its devastation, no sense of impending doom and the ONLY reason that there are any fatalities in the movie are solely due to sheer stupidity and appalling writing. Put it this way, if you think about it, the douche son inadvertently kills pretty much everyone that is shown to be dead in the movie. All because of terrible writing that makes massive leaps in logic to justify falsely earned scenes of ""tension"" (because they're not intense in the least). And don't even get me started on the woman that gets randomly/senselessly ""pinned"" by a car on the ridge. Couldn't stop laughing at that.

The movie goes like this...

45% build-up.
5% some mild wave stuff (again, just a splashed ridge and hotel).
45% dad looking for family afterward.",1470182400,3,1890,4.419540229885057

Nothing comes of it and he stays to catch the ferry next day. Things escalate rapidly from that point on.

First of all, the acting by the whole cast is excellent. It's nice to see believable, realistic, superb sci-fi film coming out from Norway (another good one is Occupied). Although it is a disaster movie, it doesn't fall into the grotesque exaggeration typical of disaster movies from Hollywood (if the Hollywood suits had done the film, the whole of Norway would have fallen into the sea).",1469836800,3,1010,4.51912568306011

7694721,4,B01CX1AOC2,"Taking place at a Norwegian seaside tourist resort surrounded by snow-peaked mountains, The Wave (original Norwegian title: Bolgen) follows a member (Kristoffer Jonner) of a scientific team that monitors the region for seismic activity that would seem to be a precursor to earthquakes or avalanches.  Just days before he and his family are set to leave the area for his new job with an oil company, troubling signs begin to manifest themselves that indicate something is happening with the mountain across the bay.  Initially meeting only skepticism from his co-workers, the team's sensors detect more subterranean activity and they begin to take the threat more seriously.  Not in time, though - a huge spike in seismic activity rocks the mountain and sends tonnes of ice and rock cascading into the bay below, creating a massive tsunami that will take only ten minutes to reach the little seaside town.

The leadup to and arrival of the avalanche and the wave it creates, plus the desperate, last minute flight to escape the catatsrophe, is great, high-tension disaster film-making, and the focus on a relatively small group of characters, including Jonner's character Kristian's family, makes it personal.  The Wave boasts high quality performances and impressive visuals, and draws fully on the natural beauty of the Norwegian coastline where it takes place.  One place where it's a little different from most other disaster movies is that much of the film takes place after the initial catastrophe has occured and ended, focusing quite a bit on those few hours after the event that are so crucial to the search for survivors.  It does this without ever seeming anti-climactic.

The Wave isn't that well known in North America, but it deserves to be.  It's one of the better recent disaster movies, and another brick in a wall of Very impressive filmmaking emerging from Norway over recent years.",1469664000,,1900,5.083601286173633
7694722,4,B01CX1AOC2,Excellent film with great characters and classic disaster movie format.  The only bad thing is the english dub.  It is horrendous.

7694723,4,B01CX1AOC2,"When Hollywood produces a disaster film it is typically something that is an epic, global catastrophic event. However, the Norwegian produced The Wave deals with a much more regional disaster and one that is quite real to the residents of Norway. With many towns and villages located on fjords, surrounded by mountains, the danger of tsunami producing rockslides is a daily threat.wave 2

Set within the quaint village of Geiranger, Kristian is a geologist who works for the local agency that monitors seismic movements in the mountains and assess the threat to the residents. Krisitan has accepted a job with an oil company in a larger town and is ready to move his family. On the way to the local ferry with his son and daughter and already on edge over sensor readings, he suspects that there is an imminent threat. His co-workers believe he is over-reacting and so he returns for one more night in his home with his daughter while his teenaged son Sondre spends the night with his wife, Idun, at the hotel where she works.

Kristian and his daughter lie down for the night while his former co-workers venture down into the mountain crevices to take a closer look. Kristian recalls past incidents where the crevices contracted rather than expanded and were quickly followed up by a rockslide. As the mountainside begins to tumble into the ocean he orders a red alert, setting off sirens throughout the village. However the people only have minutes to flee into the nearby hills before a massive tsunami strikes. With his daughter safe, Kristian has to navigate the villages destruction and try to find his wife and son.

For a film with a budget of a mere $6.5 million The Wave makes good use of every penny. While its visual effects are nowhere near the level of films like 2012 or San Andreas, what is has it uses for maximum effect. We only get a couple of minutes, if that, of the massive wave and its devastation on the town but it is extremely effective. Director Roar Uthaug is a huge fan of American disaster films and he definitely learned his craft well. He didn't have a large enough budget to pull off some of the effects seen in those bigger films, but makes up for it with a good dose of suspense as Kristian searches for his family.

The Wave features some truly awe-inspiring scenery. Filmed in Norway, the cinematography is absolutely breathtaking and as a lifelong resident of the suburbs I cannot imagine waking up in the morning and looking out my living room window to see towering mountains and a crystal clear blue lake. While it might be smaller in scale The Wave is an enjoyable and well-acted disaster film.

7694739,4,B01CX1AOC2,"(basic outline written within the review)
The film is based upon an incident that destroyed the village of 'Tafjord' killing 40 people on 7th April 1934.....the fjords of Norway
are prone to rock-slide/Tsunami occurrences .
The film is set in the picturesque village of 'Geiranger' situated at the head of the 'Geirangerfjord'
'Kristian' (Kristoffer Joner) a geologist, works with a small team monitoring any changes that may occur in the mountainsides of the
fjord....when two monitoring lines close down they investigate, they find the lines to have been mysteriously severed.
This worries 'Kristian' ...when he also notices other changes he consults his colleagues with his concerns, they seek to reassure him
that minor changes happen all the time.
However, 'Kristian's' fears are about to be realized, he is with his young daughter 'Julia' (Edith Haagenrud-Sande) when the warning
sirens are triggered, his wife 'Idun' (Ane Dahl Torp) is at work at the local hotel, their son 'Sondre' (Jonas Hoff Oftebro) is with her.
'Kristian' knows he has but 10 minutes to get his daughter and himself to high ground before the 300 foot wave strikes, events along
the way see him separated from 'Julia' though a friend takes his daughter on to safety.
When the wave has subsided 'Kristian' who had taken refuge in a car trying to save a woman that had been injured during the flight
has survived, though the car itself had been thrown and lay upside-down.
When he establishes that 'Julia' is safe his thoughts turn to his wife and son, the coach that is at the ready at the hotel for incidents such
as this is nowhere to be seen.
With great fear for their safety he goes in search of his loved ones leaving his daughter, safe, with friends,,,,,below the hill the village
lies in ruins, many have died.
He will come across the coach that was supposed to take guests and staff alike to safety, overturned and covered in debris, searching
the grim scene he finds that his wife and son are not among the victims on board, events earlier had prevented them boarding.
He'll now have to make his way to the hotel in fear of what he is likely to find........could they have possibly survived the wave that the
hotel had been in the direct path of ??
A low-budget offering in which many of the cast apparently insisted on performing many of the dangerous stunts along the way....
The film is certainly an edge-of-your-seat offering which will keep you totally engaged as the tension mounts.
The visual-effects are pretty convincing...
This is a very well made film.
This copy i have 'Norwegian' language and has 'German' sub-titles - though i cannot speak or read either, the story flow speaks for
itself and is easy to follow.
I suspect when released in the U.K / U.S it will have English sub-titles....as an earlier reviewer suggested it would i feel be wrong to 'dub'

So, THIS Norwegian flick is about what happens when a tsunami hits. I'm closer to 70 than seven, so, I'm used to calling
one of THOSE a ""tidal wave"". There's a lot of mountains in Europe; got one in MY backyard: it's a dormant volcano. I am
located, dead-center, in Germany... at over 700M above sea level, so flooding is of no concern. However, a mountain in
Norway, named Akerneset, towers over the tourist-spot Geiranger... and others... that line the fjords. I think that the folks
up north are more concerned with asylum seekers right now, but THIS danger is just as possible, and is more spectacular
to WATCH! This  movie was submitted for consideration at the 88th Academy Awards, but was NOT nominated. It ISN'T a
loser though. It's top-notch entertainment that I ALMOST skipped over because I'm just TIRED of untertitlin... subtitles...
undertitles.
I give this movie all FIVE fingers---on BOTH hands--- all the way UP!
