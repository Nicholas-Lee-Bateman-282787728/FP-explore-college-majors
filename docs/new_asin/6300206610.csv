222714,4,6300206610,"Hallmark finally follows up their initial Laurel and Hardy DVD release with this second volume, and there appears to be an issue with some over the quality versus similarly released European versions.  I have not seen these other releases, so I can't comment on them in comparison to this one, but if you have a DVD player that will accommodate DVD releases from other countries, you might want to choose buying the alternative rather than this release (I figure if you own such a DVD player, you'd be willing to search out various releases for the best quality, but I don't so this is what I have).

The first feature is Chickens Come Home (1931), 30 minutes, and features Ollie as a prominent businessman (seller of high grade fertilizer), running for mayor under the campaign of `cleaning the city of vice'.  Only problem is an indiscretion from his past show up, with the pictures to prove it, and is looking for her own payday in order to keep quiet.  On the night Ollie is supposed to meet with her, his wife is holding a dinner party with some very influential people, so he sends Stan to run interference until he can get away and deal with the determined woman.

The second feature, Way Out West (1937), 65 minutes, takes place in the old west, as one might deduce from the title, and has Stan and Ollie delivering a deed to a valuable gold mine to the daughter of the recently deceased owner, but they're tricked into handing over the deed to an unscrupulous saloon owner (James Finlayson, master of the exaggerated double-take) and his attractive wife, who also happens to provide entertainment at the saloon in the form of a singer.  The boys soon learn of the swindle, and try to make things right by attempting to retrieve the deed and deliver it to its rightful owner, a poor dishwashing woman who also works in the saloon.

The third and final feature is Block-Heads (1938), 57 minutes, and begins during WWI as Stan and Ollie are soldiers and Stan is ordered to hold a trench while the rest of the men, including Ollie, go over the hill to engage the enemy.  For whatever reason the men don't return, and Stan is left guarding the trench for the next 20 years as no one returns to tell him the war finally ended.  He's finally made aware of the fact, returns to the states where Ollie finds him and bring him home, only to have Stan inadvertently destroy not only his home but also Ollie's marriage.

I don't think I'd encounter too much argument in my saying I think this is one of the greatest comedic duos of all time, and in watching these features one can see how much they've influenced those who have followed.  Take Way Out West...how many times have you seen the `piano' gag (characters hiding inside a grand piano, only to have the antagonist begin striking the piano keys, and those inside being tormented by the pianos innards) in various cartoons and such?  I think part of what made the duo so enduring, even to this day, is the underlying friendship and commitment (on and off the screen) to each other, despite the onscreen disputes and debacles.  They may often be at odds with each other, but that quickly fades as an outside force comes into play, such as in Way Out West with James Finlayson's (who appeared in a great number of Laurel and Hardy features) character of the greedy saloon owner, and then the boys become united against a common foe.  Speaking of Finlayson, he was a wonderful supporting comedic actor in his own right, often overshadowed by the larger than life antics of others.  Did he deserve more than what he got?  I'm unsure, but I do know without his performances these features would have lacked something that few could have replaced.

As far as the picture quality of the features on the DVD...I thought it was decent (as was the audio), but other reviews say it could have been better, and offer options that may be worth looking into, so my advice is to read the other reviews and consider their recommendations before purchasing.  I did notice a few moments where there were flaws in the picture, which I had attributed them to the age of the features, rather than the source material used, but that may not be the case.

222715,4,6300206610,"Like they gave us with the first DVD volume two years ago, elements for the contents of this DVD come not from restored prints, like those from the recent UK DVD's, but from aged broadcast TV videotape sources.  That being said, I still recommend this disc, because if this one doesn't sell well, then that's it.  All you get from here on in is poor grade public domain bargain bin DVD's packaged 100 different ways from material that in no way reflects Stan and Ollie at the height of their sound-era careers.

It is fortunate that with the two Hallmark DVD's we have at least been given two (make that three) of their best features in terms of comedic pacing and charm.  Volume 1 gave us ""Sons Of The Desert"", and Volume 2 gives us ""Way Out West"" (my personal favorite) and ""Block-Heads"" (not a lot to the plot, but great set pieces carry the film for its all-to-brief 'feature' length). This is the only reason this disc deserves any stars at all.

The lack of respect shown by Hallmark, who owns the rights and some very fine elements but gives the public a presentation no better than something out of Wal-Mart's $3 blowout bin, towards the Roach catalogue (including The Little Rascals) by simply sitting on them is nothing short of apalling.  If any of you have ever owned the 12-disc Cabin Fever Little Rascals set that featured introductions by Leonard Maltin then you know that the Laurel & Hardy Hal Roach-era films deserve so much better than this.

222719,5,6300206610,"Finally, we are getting more Laurel and Hardy films on DVD. This one has two of their best features. Way out West (1937) has the boys traveling to Brushwood Gultch to find the heir to a mine. A saloon owner, played by the always great Jimmy Finlayson, tricks them out of the deed, and Stan and Ollie must get it back. Some of the boys best comedy is here, along with some great songs and a nice dance routine from the boys.

Blockheads (1938) Opens during World war one in France. The boys are in a trench, Ollie and the rest of the troops go on the offensive, leaving Stan to guard the trench. Flash forward 20 years, and Stan is still guarding the trench!! No one told him the war was over. He returns home to live at a veterans home. Ollie sees his picture in the paper and goes to see him and take him home. Ollies wife walks out because of this. This leads to some very funny moments. The last half of this film is a virtual remake of Laurel and Hardy's first sound film, Unacustomed as we are (1928).

Also included is a short from 1931, Chickens come Home, in which businessman Oliver Hardy is running for Mayor. Unfortunatley, a woman from his past (Mae Busch) show up with a embarassing picture of Ollie and demands to be paid off. Ollies business partner, Stan, has to keep her away from Ollie's home, where he and his wife, (Thelma Todd) are having a party. Not the best Laurel and Hardy short, but it does have some funny moments.",1106006400,25,1442,4.297794117647059

222722,5,6300206610,"Way Out West remains one of Laurel & Hardy's most cherished, sweet and ""accessible"" films. Not only does its gently satirical Western plot hold up, but the comedy is as fresh and well-timed as ever, it contains one of ""the boys'"" best film background music scores -- and it features the truly beautiful singing voice of Oliver Hardy (who sang a lot when he was younger)...PLUS one of the most memorable and wonderful little dances film.
  Way Out West is a GREAT flick for ALL ages whether in the original black and white or the beautifully and tastefully colorized version released several years ago. Probably the only film of theirs that comes so close to being so PERFECT and holding up so well is Sons of the Desert, which is more of a situation comedy. Way Out West is a mite more slapstick...plus it has the great songs and their most famous dance.
  As usual, the film's plot is merely a device for making the audience howl with laughter at the comedy and sense the genuine chemistry and friendship between them (they were also great friends off screen). The plot a nutshell: they breeze into town, unwittingly angering their fellow stagecoach passenger, a lady  who happens to be the wife of the town's formidable sheriff (played by Tiny Sanford). Their mission: personally deliver a valuable gold mine deed to the daughter of a dead partner.
James Finlayson -- originator of the DOH! catchphrase later used and made popular  by Homer Simpson -- plays the daughter's lying guardian who schemes to steal the goldmine by having his girlfriend saloon-maid (Sharon Lynne) pose as the daughter to the unsuspecting L&H.
  Way Out West moves quickly with virtually no padding. This 1937 movie, produced by Stan Laurel (the creative force behind the act)is a MUST for comedy-loves and students of comedy because of:
1. A running gag with Hardy being pulled across the river by a mule.
2. Several never-to-be duplicated slapstick sequences, such as their trying to sneak into the house. Their comedy bits remain as fresh as the day they were filmed.
3. Oliver Hardy's wonderful voice singing ""The Trail of the Lonesome Pine."" Done with a comedy touch with Laurel.
4. Their dance as the Avalon Boys sing ""At the Ball, That's All."" L&H start by tapping their feet casually, then dance together in a dance combining joy of music, friendship and playful humor. This short dance's grace, sweetness, and spontenaity -- even with the huge Hardy (who was light on his feet) -- has never been matched on film. They made it look easy (and maybe they had so much fun that it WAS).
5. Marvin Hatley's intricate musical score. It should be studied by anyone interested in seeing how musical instruments can be made to sound funny and silly and enhance onscreen action (recreations of parts of this score are available on various CDs).
  How does Way Out West hold up? Very well. I don't think anyone has apologize to a young person about the comedy's pace. Although not as frentic as some modern comedies, it has a natural pace and is immediately engaging. I showed it to Greg, 10, and Kayla, 6, and their response was: ""Show us some more of their movies!!""",1024358400,9,3143,4.73992673992674

""Way Out West"" has a simple storyline of Laurel And Hardy trying to deliver a deed to a gold mine to a young woman who is being treated like a slave in a Western Saloon and Hotel. Of course it get's in the wrong hands and the boys attempts to get it back are laugh out loud hilarious! While much of this is broad slapstick, there are some more subtle moments between the boys that are equally as funny!

In ""Block- Heads"" Laurel is still guarding the same post twenty years after World War I is over....when he is finally rescued and reunited with his pal, Hardy, his adjustment to the modern world is slow, as to be expected, and what follows is one crazy situation after another....it's difficult to explain, as this is really one comedy routine after another. I remember seeing this as a youngster on TV when they were edited into 10 to 15 minute segments. But they're still funny as all get out!

Curiously, the packaging is more slight the second time around; the figures on the cover look less like Stan & Ollie and more like impersonators. And the menu graphics are OK but not as elaborate as Part I. But this is a minor quibble; it's the content that counts. Two of L&H's best comedies are featured, along with a short. ""Way Out West"" is probably my favorite L&H feature film, and for good reason: It's pure 100% L&H from start to finish, with no cumbersome romantic subplots or inflated musical numbers. In fact, what music featured is performed by the boys themselves, demonstrating their rich, pleasing harmonies on ""On the Trail of the Lonesome Pine"" (Hardy was a singer in his younger days). The boys even perform an amusing soft-shoe number on the dusty streets, and it feels as if they improvised it on the spot. It's one of those magical moments in which L&H can make these numbers seem perfectly natural & utterly charming. L&H portray Easterners travelling out West (They barely get into town & are already in trouble with the law!) to deliver a gold mine deed to a young lady whose unscrupulous guardian/saloon owner (frequent L&H stock player James Finlayson, the man who exclaimed ""DOH!"" long before Homer Simpson) & gal pal catch wind (actually, Stan dumbly spills the beans) & steal the deed. The remainder of the film has Stan & Ollie trying to set things right & retrieve the deed, in their usually hilarious/disastrous fashion. It's a breezy comedy that's filled with wonderfully broad sight gags (Stan lighting his thumb; Stan trying to pull Ollie's head out of the floor; Ollie plunging not once but twice into the same bottomless sinkhole in the gulch).
""Block-Heads"" begins as a WWI tale as Ollie goes over the top of the trench with his unit & Stan is left to guard; except, it's twenty years later, and Stan's still there (the deep groove in the ground & pile of empty bean cans a testament to his time there)! Finally rescued & brought back to civilization, Hardy goes to the Veterans Home & finds Stan in a wheelchair, with a leg missing (this is a gag that could've been distasteful but is actually amusing in L&H's hands because of the outcome). Hardy brings Laurel home to meet the Mrs. & soon realizes Stan is more trouble than he's worth as the car, the kitchen, and then the marriage are systematically destroyed.
""Chickens Come Home"" has politician Hardy's standing threatened by a meddlesome woman (Mae Busch) as the boys fumble to keep her concealed from Hardy's wife as well as the media.

222794,5,6300206610,"Not much more than the three titles here - the ""extras"" aren't much - but here we have very fine DVD pressings of top drawer L & H. Some lesser known Stan & Ollie flicks from the non-independent, large-scale studios in the following decade have been released recently, and though they have historical significant and some sporadic fun (if you can supress your ""couda-shoulda"" button), they only emphasize the often brilliant and heartwarming stuff which really made them famous. We have three examples here: a 1937 trip out West, about one hour long, yet absolutely loaded with inventive gags (though a midnight attempt to hoist Ollie to the second floor of Finlayson's Saloon is badly dragged out) and clever dialogue. Ofcourse, the performances are great, and in Way Out West have the added dimension of music and ""magic"". While Hardy tries to plot out the rescue of a young lady and her deed to a goldmine, Laurel constantly befuddles his partner with all kinds of reality manipulations - like using his thumb as a lighter!
The next year, they produced a partial remake of their very first ""talkie"" - it's fun to compare Unaccustomed As We Are from '29 to Blockheads. The later film is far better and contains much pathos. Hardy's wife, who starts off her day reminding her husband that he forgot their anniversary, then returns to find old buddy Stan lounging about, delivers an incredible, drammaticly schizophrenic display - one of the great moments in comedy history. Ultimately, it is typical L & H - Ollie's new found respectability is torn asunder by the well-meaning but completely incompetent Stan, who wrecks his car, his apartment...and his marriage. By the end of the film he flees with his friend from his home and a violent neighbor who believes he is a filanderer.
The 1931 short-subject is an hilarious work - again Ollie is on the threshold of true acceptance in high society, until Mae Busch shows up to upset his political plans, his marriage, and Stan himself in a wild wrestling match outside of her hotel suite. This is perhaps her sexiest performance - and her attitude is all business - she wants her share of the success. Her acting is bit more nuanced than usual - she projects admiration and revulsion of Hardy at the same time.
Side note: I've read of the Spanish-language version of this film and hope that it can become available through this company.",1173398400,,2384,4.802919708029197

222797,4,6300206610,"I'll admit it up front.  I do not enjoy or appreciate slapstick comedy.  But since L&H are legendary, I thought I should see something they've done.  Well I think I made a good choice because these short films (about an hour each) are very entertaining, even for non-slapstick appreciators.

I especially liked a scene in 'Way Out West' in which Stan & Ollie perform a dance routine in front of a saloon while cowboys sing a song on the porch.  It's almost surreal and a little out of place with the rest of the movie, which is as expected, mostly slapstick. 'Block-Heads' is also very good, especially when Ollie thinks Stan has only one leg (he doesn't), and he proceeds to carry him everywhere.  Naturally, Stan just thinks Ollie is being nice, so he lets him.

I can see no reason why this DVD would not have any slapstick fan falling down laughing.",1158364800,,853,4.5359477124183005
222798,5,6300206610,I recall seeing a lot of Laurel and Hardy when I was a kid (too long ago) on local TV shows for kids. Chickens Come Home contains the funniest sequence I have ever seen.  This is part when Stan goes to the apartment of the home trying to blackmail Ollie. It ends with his mother in law's car being hit and falling completely apart in the street. One time when I saw this I was laughing so hard I thought I might be having a stoke. The rest of the film is on about the same level.,1149206400,,479,3.9381443298969074
222799,5,6300206610,"As with any classic Laurel & Hardy, the plot is unimportant and just a frame on which to showcase their sweetly innocent brand of humor. Here they're trying to keep ownership of a goldmine out of the greedy clutches of a saloon owner and his blonde canary. The boys don't show up until 10 minutes into the proceedings, but from then on they are center stage with one routine after another. Most are pretty funny, though the keep-away parlor chase goes on a shade too long as does the break-in escapade. However, when Hardy smugly revels in his superiority only to lose his outer garments and dignity to Laurel's witless bungling, we get a good look at the core of their appeal.

The comedy bits may be entertaining, but the several song and dance numbers are sublime. Notice how effortlessly the duo picks up on the hiccupping beat of the musical Avalon Boys. The resulting dance duet is among the most charming in film annals. Hardy in particular transforms from ungainly fat man into nimble blithe spirit, a beguiling triumph of grace over bulk, and more meaningful in its implications than the miles of over-produced, over-choreographed numbers from Hollywood's army of Big Musicals.

Sadly, theirs is the fey, gentle humor of an era gone by. Quite simply, there's been no one like them before or since, and I shudder to think how they would be marketed to today's 15 year-olds who make up the bulk of the theatre-going audience and DVD purchasers. But at least a permanent record of their achievement remains for the rest of us who enjoy this lighthearted look at classic comedy.",1145318400,,1583,4.752727272727273

222802,5,6300206610,"Way Out West is generally regarded as Laurel and Hardy's best feature film. Next to Sons Of The Desert. It is the only other L&H film to be a Stan Laurel Production(the other being Our Relations from a year earlier).Definetly one of my favourite L&H films. Not a dull moment in the movie. Rarely do we actually see Stan laugh. Not only is this one of their films where Oliver sings beautifully,but Stan also sings with a cartoonish trick voice. There are a lot of special effects in this movie as well. Such as Stan igniting his thumb,the boys running away from the sheriff in fast motion,and Stan trying to pull Ollie out of a trapdoor by the head and stretching Ollie's neck impossibley high in the process.

Way Out West was definetly a must for my Laurel & Hardy collection!",1138320000,,778,4.5177304964539005
222803,5,6300206610,"It is often said that ""Way Out West"" is the BEST of the Laurel and Hardy features.  It is certainly a unique film, with its western setting, and it has higher production values than most of their films.  It is definitely extremely funny, beginning with their first appearance and the subsequent disaster that occurs when they attempt to cross a stream.  They are accompanied by a mule, who provides quite a few of the laughs in the movie.

Later, they match wits again with one of their perennial opponents, James Finlayson, the delightfully funny and wicked Scotsman who was always determined to get the best of them.  ""Fin"" seldom had a better opportunity to try and outwit Laurel and Hardy than in this film.

One of the real delights, however, is their wonderful song-and-dance routine as they perform ""The Trail of the Lonesome Pine.""  This performance was later issued commercially and proved an unexpected big hit.  Oliver Hardy certainly had a very fine tenor voice and had sung professionally before he became a film star.  Stan Laurel brought considerable experience as a British music hall star, where he learned his trade with Charles Chaplin, as part of Fred Karno's troupe.  Both Laurel and Chaplin toured the U.S.A. and subsequently became involved in the infant film industry here.

""Block-Heads"" takes Laurel and Hardy from their experiences together in the U.S. Army during World War I.  Somehow Laurel was left behind in the trenches and didn't know the war had ended. Finally discovered and rescued, Laurel is brought back home and reunited with Hardy, who thinks Laurel has lost a leg in the war because he has tucked up one of his legs as he sits on a bench.  Hardy proceeds to carry Laurel around until he finally discovers the truth; remarkably, Laurel never stops to tell Hardy that he is able to walk.  Later, Hardy brings Laurel home, leading to a terrible confrontation with Hardy's wife.  There are also a series of very funny disasters that virtually destroy Hardy's house and garage and lead to the end of his marriage.  This is all handled with great comic skill.

These are still very funny films and one enjoys the apparent care and concern that Hardy shows toward Laurel, despite Laurel's tendency to get Hardy into ""another fine mess.""",1137628800,8,2271,4.841968911917099
222818,4,6300206610,"L&H seem to be more known for their shorts than their features, but this disc contains two of their most famous and most popular features, 'Way Out West' (1937) and 'Blockheads' (1938).  'Way Out West' has them delivering a gold mine deed to a young woman they've never met, and their hilarious efforts to get the deed back after they discover they were tricked into giving it to the wrong woman.  This film contains many great gags and scenes, such as hiding in the piano, accidentally hoisting their donkey onto an upper-level veranda, and the little dance the boys break into before entering the saloon.  'Blockheads' doesn't have much of a plot, but it's so fun it doesn't really matter.  Stan has been in the trenches for 20 years, never having been told WWI was over, and Ollie discovers this and goes to bring him back.  Most of the movie involves what happens on their way up to the apartment Ollie and his wife share; the final third or so is a remake of their first talkie, 'Unaccustomed As We Are.'  There's also a bonus short, 'Chickens Come Home' (1931).  This had never been one of my favorite shorts of theirs (though that doesn't mean it's one of my least-favorites either), but when I watched it again I came to find it was more funny than I had long given it credit for.  I suppose absence was making the heart grow fonder, given that I hadn't seen it in like 8 years (given how AMC no longer shows the boys and how hard it is to find their sound films anywhere else).  This short is also practically a word-by-word and gag-by-gag remake of their 1927 pre-teaming silent 'Love 'Em and Weep,' only in the remake Ollie and not Jimmy Finlayson is the one getting blackmailed by a gold-digger from his past.  By this time, Jimmy was no longer a starring comedian in his own right and had been reduced to a supporting character actor, albeit one of the best character actors in the business.  All in all, a really nice selection.

However, the prints are the real problem with this package.  Granted, they're a step up from the terrible ones on the first Hallmark volume, but that doesn't mean they're flaw-free and perfect either.  They're nowhere near what I would consider unwatchable, but it's obvious they weren't assembled with a lot of care or thought.  Hallmark could have put out better prints if they wanted; they can't honestly claim these were the best source materials available.  Most fans are aware that there are much better-looking releases of their films available in other markets, so it's not as though these were the best prints available and there could only be so much digital remastering done given their age.  The sound quality isn't always the greatest either.  Although we should be thankful these prints aren't any worse; the print of 'Way Out West' TCM has been showing is an old colorised copy from the Eighties, only with the color turned off.  It looks horrible, and makes this one look nearly flawless by comparison.

Hallmark has demonstrated that they don't even care about L&H's legacy (they were even going to throw all of their films away after they acquired them but thankfully were prevailed upon not to), and it doesn't look like they're planning to release any more of these discs anytime soon.  Shortly after buying this disc I bought the 21-disc set available on amazon.co.uk and got a region-free DVD player, something I would recommend to all fans who haven't done so already.  It may cost a little extra, but for now it's the only way to properly enjoy the boys.",1135987200,7,3522,4.655896607431341
222819,4,6300206610,"In this film Stan and Ollie are sent out West to deliver an inheritance to a nice, sweet girl who is unfairly treated by her mean guardians Mr. Finn and his wife.  The inheritance is a deed to a gold mine, and when the greedy Mr. Finn hears of this he disguises his wife as the girl who is supposed to get the deed, and Stan and Ollie are duped into giving the deed to the wrong person as a result.  In the end though, after much effort, the deed is restored to the proper and deserving person, and she heads down south to Dixie with Stan and Ollie, Stan being from the South himself (""the South of London"").

I used to love this film as a kid.  I laughed so much when Ollie told Stan, ""If you don't eat that hat, I'll tie you to a tree and let the buzzards get ya.""  I still love this movie, but not as much as I used to.  I've developed more of a taste for faster-paced comedies like the Three Stooges and the Marx Brothers.  Still, this film is wonderful.  I think it was my favorite Laurel and Hardy film because it was colorized, and the color does look great, but it would still be a wonderful film on a black and white TV.  The physical comedy is top notch; I particularly like the part where Ollie's neck is stretched beyond belief, and the part where Ollie's hefty weight accidentally pulls an old mule onto a balcony, and the part where Ollie ties Mr. Finn up to a chandelier.  I think the guy that played Mr. Finn is a Laurel and Hardy regular but I'm not sure.  In this movie he had a smoking hot wife, even by today's standards.  Mr. Finn had money of course, so that's how his whole relationship with the gold digger started.  They didn't even sleep in the same room.  To be fair though, I guess back then the entertainment industry couldn't show two people in the same bed.

This movie had some really great songs, and it shows you how long ago comedians could often sing and dance as well.  I really like the yodeling song at the beginning of the film and the ""Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia"" song.  Without musical interludes such as these, this film wouldn't have been half as good as it was.

I thought the funniest part in the movie was when they opened the door for the Sheriff.  That's just great writing right there.  However, it's a joke I don't want to spoil by telling it in advance.  Just trust me, it's funny.  Also believe me when I say that this is a good movie.",1128211200,,2394,4.203947368421052

I just bought the Universal Laurel and Hardy 21 Volume Box set which is only available in Europe from Amazon UK (region 2). This set is EVERYTHING people are saying it is. It is a complete film history of the boys which starts with the boys early silent films ( some solo efferts) and goes though the Hal Roach Features. All the prints are restored and of pristine quality. A truly beautiful set and a worthy tribute to the boys. There are some missing films ( I assume for copyright reasons) such as Babes in Toyland, The Devils Brother, Bonnie Scotland and Flying Deuces.

To acomadate these DVDs I bought a region free DVD player off Amazon,which is the only way to go if you really want to collect. The DVD player was very cheap. plays beautfully and  is well worth the investment. As a side note if you have a region free player all the DVDs in the Universal Box set are also availble as single dics, in case you don't want to spend all the money at once or just want a few of the films.

222821,5,6300206610,"This is a pretty bad copy of Laurel and Hardy's work. This is what I think the studio should do:

  1. Release all 32 silent shorts that have both Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. BOTH OF THEM. No Charlie Chase shorts with only Hardy; no shorts with just Laurel; BOTH!!! They should put them in chronological order (starting with LUCKY DOG) with four shorts on a DVD. That makes eight DVDs.

  2. Release all 40 sound shorts (chronologically) that have Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. They should release ten DVDs with 4 shorts on each disc.

  3. Release all the full-length movies with Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. They include PARDON US; PACK UP YOUR TROUBLES; THE DEVIL'S BROTHER; SONS OF THE DESERT; BABES IN TOYLAND; BONNIE SCOTLAND; THE BOHEMIAN GIRL; OUR RELATIONS; WAY OUT WEST; SWISS MISS; BLOCK-HEADS; THE FLYING DEUCES; A CHUMP AT OXFORD; SAPS AT SEA; GREAT GUNS; A-HAUNTING WE WILL GO; AIR RAID WARDENS; JITTERBUGS; THE DANCING MASTERS; THE BIG NOISE; THE BULLFIGHTERS; NOTHING BUT TROUBLE; and ATOLL K. Release them separately. One movie a disc.

  4. Release a two disc DVD set of movies that have Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy in only small parts. Such shorts as THE STOOLEN JOOLS; ON THE LOOSE; WILD POSES; ON THE WRONG TREK; and THE TREE IN A TEST TUBE and the full-length movies THE HOLLYWOOD REVUE OF 1929; HOLLYWOOD PARTY; and PICK A STAR.

  5. Each DVD should have trailers of that short or movie (if available), photos, production notes, subtitles in French, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Mexican, and whatever other languages they think the DVDs should have.

  These DVDs should be painstakingly remastered with state-of-the-art technology so that each film has the best sound and picture quality. Also, no sets. We comedy lovers like to chose what movies to watch and not have to buy a whole set (aka: It's a Gift). Also no colorization of any kind.

  So that makes 8 DVDs of their silent shorts, 10 DVDs of their sound shorts, 23 DVDs with their full-length movies, and a two disc DVD set with their short movie appearances.

Virtually everything in the Laurel & Hardy catalog is out there in fine shape. The only issue is format, but that's not much of an issue, either.

222826,1,6300206610,"This second release of films of the great Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy by Hallmark proves beyond a shadow of a doubt how LITTLE(if at all!) this company cares about the material it owns.
They have truly made incompetence and indifference into an art form.
As with their first release Hallmark has chosen again to use whatever inferior original film elements they have on hand,use the absolute basic of digital enhancement and release these as if they were indicative of the best that were available.
I have seen both of these features in their European versions and can tell you without a second thought that these Hallmark releases are close to the worst that could have been released here in North America.
Some specific comments:
Again none of the original MGM lion openings are in these versions and the short ""Chickens Come Home"" is another ""Film Classics"" 50s release c/w opening ""plaque"".
During the dance sequence in 'Way Out West' The Boys are shot firstly with their backs to the town. About half way through the camera turns and the saloon is now behind them. At this juncture you suddenly see the picture ""jump"" and The Boys are now dancing out of sequence to the music accompanying them(!!),then just as they start up the stairs another ""jump"" occurs and they go back in sync. Absolutely astounding.
Both of these Hallmark releases beg the question:Do they have  quality control personnel?? That is,does anyone ever just simply sit down and watch the finished product?? The only person that might have ""passed"" them would have been Ben Turpin.....maybe.
As I have stated in my review of Hallmarks' previous L&H release all of these films are available in their original versions(and in FAR better shape than these mediocre prints/sources would indicate).So there is NO excuse for such inferior release product such as this.
When one sees Laurel and Hardys' silent films preserved and released in far superior condition than these it has to make you wonder.
When a foreign company such as Lobster Films of France can release an astoundingly clear,fresh and wonderfully transferred print of the 'Flying Deuces'(that puts the Hallmarks to shame!),which is in the public domain and been through more hands than in the US Marine Corps,this also has to make you wonder.
And lastly when one sees what REAL and proper film restoration is all about with the release last year of Metropolis(see my review on that) this has to convince even the most undecided that there is definitely something wrong here.
And there is.....VERY wrong.
Hallmark it would seem is the WRONG company to have control of the Laurel and Hardy product. They are no more interested in their subject matter than they are in obtaining the best possible prints and doing the proper restoration and digital work needed to produce a fine product that everyone can be proud of.
For shame Hallmark.",1112572800,66,2868,4.925619834710743
222827,4,6300206610,"Well,it's been a year since Hallmark has released the first voulume of what would be a series of Laurel & Hardy DVD's featuring a great collection of classic two-reelers and features. However,many fans of the films that have bought the first DVD were not too pleased with the quality of the prints that were used on the DVD,most notably the '80's television cut of their 1933 classic SONS OF THE DESERT that was eventually used for Hal Roach's hugely successful LAUREL & HARDY SHOW series. When I read that there was going to be a second volume of L&H's films on DVD,I was very anxious and excited to get my hands on a copy! Well the wait was finally over and I finally bought the DVD and boy was it well worth the wait !! LAUREL & HARDY II is a terrific DVD that contains three of their best,if not funniest of their films,one being a short,that contains the mother of all of their great features,1937's WAY OUT WEST,one definite reason to buy this DVD !,1938'S BLOCK-HEADS (their last MGM/Hal Roach film),and the 1931 two-reel short CHICKENS COME HOME.

The Advantages of this DVD:

First of all,the print quality on WAY OUT WEST is absolutely amazing,but not too amazing though as there are appearences of grain and some light contrast that appears about two-thirds of the reel,but doesn't become a big problem as it's perhaps a good transfer of a late '30's film. Plus,it's also finally available in its original glorious black & white version that hasn't been seen since it's original release. The only version that was currently available was the god-awful colorized version from the Roach Studios Film Classics Library created back in 1985 as there were appearances of halos and time-compression on several scenes including Marvin Hatley's classic score. If they used a transfer of the color version onto black & white on this DVD instead of the current transfer,I wouldn't buy it !! All in all,this classic L & H film never looked as better as it did nearly 80 yrs ago! BLOCK-HEADS also looks very very good although some scenes have dirt and bits of scratch,but nevertheless looked a lot better than the version that shown on THE LAUREL & HARDY SHOW back in the '80's. Hallmark did a nice job on picking out the best available transfers for the two main features !

Now comes the disadvantages of the DVD:

The two-reel short on the DVD,CHICKENS COME HOME,didn't fair as better as the two main previously mentioned features. Hallmark chose a 1940's Film Classics print of the short,which by the way is missing the film title card and goes directly to the crew title cards instead. There are many scenes of dirt,grain,and dust that takes place at the first reel,but fairs some better at the second reel. But that however is no excuse for Hallmark to use a much better quality print of this short rather than just slapping it onto there with lack of improvement. Another bit of problem on the DVD is the lack of any bonus features like they had done with the previous one,all you get here is a trailer for the first L & H DVD,that's it. I would have loved to see an another two-reel short or maybe even production notes on the two main features,or maybe even colorized versions on the flip side of the disc,just like they're doing with the much well-recieved U.K. DVD releases nowadays!! The best part of the DVD however is that there is a PLAY ALL option !!!!

I've read some of the reviews of this disc that are on here and I really don't think that it's all that bad!! I don't mean to be very opinionated,but I feel that some people out there are taking the quality way too seriously and that they would just want to waste money on Region 2 DVD players to buy the U.K. releases of the Boys films' which are of pretty much good quality,instead of buying the U.S. releases for half the cost,yet wasting money on the films themselves when all we have left with L & H on DVD in the U.S. are the two public domain features UTOPIA and FLYING DEUCES and nothing else ! This is a much-improved Hallmark DVD of several of L & H comedies that you're probably not gonna see anywhere else in the U.S. and I highly recommend it ,even with a few bits of scratches and grains on the transfers themselves !! If you've watched yesterday's TCM April Fools Marathon of their films,than that's a whole different story! I hope that Volume III will be in the works as soon as possible !!",1112400000,3,4375,4.554002541296061
