8333752,1,B001PMICFC,"This is one of the most inane presentations of new research on an Old Master painting ever made. I have seen some real stinkers in my 20-plus years as a teacher, but this one takes the cake.  The small children who might be charmed by the Mona Lisa's infantile voice (yes, the painting narrates the story) are not going to be interested in the small fragment of news this video contains regarding Pascal Cotte's experiments with multispectral imaging of the paint surface.",1522800000,,472,4.7560975609756095

8333754,1,B001PMICFC,"I truly can't believe that someone actually used the words ""fascinating"" and ""amazing"" to describe this horrible DVD. It is 50 minutes of people talking about whether or not the Mona Lisa had eyebrows. Even the 26 ""secrets"" are too mundane and useless to even be called secrets...literally, her left index finger used to be in a slightly different position!! I left with absolutely no insight about the painting. I showed my 6th grade Art students and then apologized to them after 30 minutes of eyebrow induced boredom.",1370304000,3,520,4.920454545454546
8333755,2,B001PMICFC,"The only reason this has two stars is that the photography makes it a little better. This is a padded, ridiculous and over-blown piece that purports to be the true story of arguably the most famous painting in the world. It contains maybe 7 minutes of substance - all the rest is silly. For serious lovers, or students, of art, don't bother. Google will give you better information than this inane offering does.",1338422400,3,412,4.657534246575342
8333756,4,B001PMICFC,"This video is very interesting but not very well made.  The photography is good but the story does not flow and rather jumps from one point to another.  The photographer of the Mona Lisa, Pascal Cotte, recently aided in scrutinizing the Bella Principessa, believed to be a previously unknown Leonardo, which may be the biggest news in the art world in many a year.  The multispectoral, super high resolution camera Cotte designed, revealed much about the Mona Lisa BUT the composite photograph of the Mona Lisa, as they believed it looked when it was first painted and without the years of varnish and restorations, is NOT shown in the video.  Just a ""tease"" partial view.  I suspect that there will be a follow up DVD or book showing the actual photograph, but I have not been able to locate any follow up as yet.  If anyone does please post it here.",1330905600,2,851,4.602649006622516

This narrator's voice along with the fitting music drew me into the story of how photographer and inventor Pascal Cotte photographed the ""Mona Lisa"" at a higher resolution, than any other professional camera, to help reveal all 26 secrets of Leaonardo da Vinci's ""Mona Lisa."" Who wouldn't want to know a secret, let alone 26 ?!  It is also intriguing to find out the history behind the ""Mona Lisa"" painting.  The extra knowledge I learned from this film was amazing!  Finally, Pascal Cotte uncovered what so many individuals have questioned and found to be a mystery about the world's most famous painting.",1257292800,6,1062,7.1461538461538465
