8482537,5,B005PPE0CO,Awesome teacher! Great way to learn. I'm buying every one of this guys dvds. I bought 4 of them so far,1516924800,,102,3.9047619047619047
8482538,1,B005PPE0CO,"I bought this DVD at the bargain bin of a local music store and wanted to give it a go to see what I could learn. While the tab transcriptions look to be pretty accurate, Mark John Sternal was anything but accurate in his performance of what little I witnessed. He muffed a bunch of phrases,  was always off time when playing with the metronome, it was simply sloppy and cringe-worthy. I have seen a lot of bedroom players on YouTube doing way better performances of Randy Rhoads/Ozzy covers with lessons for free. I am wondering if the other reviewers are friends or family of Mark?",1507334400,,583,4.5
8482539,5,B005PPE0CO,very thorough... I was learning immediately,1501545600,,43,6.333333333333333
8482540,5,B005PPE0CO,It's what I've always been looking for. I can finally figure out how Randy did what he did step by step.,1467936000,,104,4.0

8482542,5,B005PPE0CO,"Back in the day when I was first learning guitar,there were no lessons like this,guitar world magazines would put out tab for some songs,but you miss out a lot being limited to tab only,this DVD which I recommend all MJS guitar videos,it's very cool that as he is instructing you,all the correct tab is displayed at the bottom of the screen,I like to pause the tab at the beginning of each lesson and get a feel for it then start the full lesson,so you get all the notes and chords below and a great instructor that doesn't rush through,in the past few days I got the DVD out and I surprised myself how much easier it is learning from MJS,I have tried other guitar videos,Lick library's Quicklicks have a great instructor (Andy James) awesome player and good tight licks but zero tab to follow,tab is an essential back up tool,I want every note to be right,I'm tone deaf so tab with video on screen is the best set up for me.my favorite lessons on this DVD,S.A.T.O.and Children of the Grave,truly a great investment. Randy Rhoads-taken from us way too soon. RIP brother",1400803200,3,1069,4.572916666666667
8482543,5,B005PPE0CO,"Mark John Sternal does an amazing job in interpreting Randy Rhoads on guitar.  The structure moves chronologically through each song (listed in the description) and is played slowly and the tab is demonstrated in each section to assist learning the piece.  Sometimes even bar by bar when necessary.  The section(s) are then put together at tempo to give you the example of how it fits in context to the song.  The fills and nuances that permeate Randy's playing are also covered in reasonable detail. This includes all the variations Randy played in the studio recordings, live shows and alternate revision.  It would have been nice to actually see a performance of the song from start to finish to get the whole example down.  But this is in no way a problem as by the time you complete the song, you should have it down anyway, especially if you play along with the recordings.

Highly recommended if you get stuck on any particular riff/fill/technique or solo that you may be struggling with in your rendition of Randy's songs.  Some of the insights into how Randy played and indeed put the tracks together should help you out.

A must for any guitarist who wants to play like Randy...  if you are prepared to put in the time and effort, you will not be disappointed with this DVD.  Great job in playing, instruction and presentation Mr Sternal...",1376870400,7,1350,4.726495726495727
8482544,5,B005PPE0CO,"Wow, I don't really know what more to say about Mark John Sternal's ability to concisely and comprehensively communicate difficult guitar concepts in such a way that makes it seem easy.  I own several of his DVDs and he is always able to help you understand in ways that elude most guitar teachers.  Sternal is very detailed, yet concise so you do not get bored.  The content of this DVD would probably take many months to go over with an in-person instructor and cost a fews hundred dollars.  And, yet, you get all of that on one DVD for less than $15 bucks.  Sternal doesn't hold anything back.  I like that he splits the screen and shows you a close-up of his hands while simultaneously displaying the tab notation.  I can't say how helpful that is rather than having to look at a book.  The only couple minor issues that I have with the DVD are that the tablature staff tends to flicker and distract a little.  And, I would have also liked to have seen a couple other popular songs that were excluded: ""Over the Mountain"" and ""Mr. Crowley.""  If it weren't for those two matters, I would give it 6 stars if possible.  Well done Mr. Sternal.",1362096000,11,1143,4.421052631578948
