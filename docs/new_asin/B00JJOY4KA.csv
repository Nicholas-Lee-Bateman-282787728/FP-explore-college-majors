8651334,3,B00JJOY4KA,"This book is okay, my son seemed to enjoy it though it does not make it into his normal rotation of books before bed very often. He always likes to read a few books before bed and this one seemed like it would be a good fit. It does have Grimlock in it which is one of his favorite characters and it is based on the original series from the 80's so I enjoy it as well.",1446076800,,368,3.792207792207792

This story all about Grimlock, where Grimlock and Dinobots come from.  You watch!
