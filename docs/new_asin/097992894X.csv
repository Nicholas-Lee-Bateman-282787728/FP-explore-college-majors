7794936,3,097992894X,this video was only 15 min long and although it was very kid friendly it wasn't much of a yoga experience. This is more like controlled playtime and nothing i would look into to purchase in the future.,1480982400,,201,4.315789473684211
7794937,2,097992894X,"The DVD spends a lot of time with the kids talking and giving each other compliments, which I don't mind, but then when it comes to the yoga poses and sequences they speed right through. My kids could not follow the yoga part after patiently sitting through all the talking, I wasn't even fast enough to pause the DVD so the kids could see what was happening. We used it once, won't again.",1422403200,,389,4.342465753424658
7794938,1,097992894X,"After reading most of the reviews, I wanted to like this product.  However, I was disappointed.  It is lead by kids which is great but there is no adult so imagine the class being run by a responsible young person.  The young lady leading it is wonderful but it doesn't work for me and it didn't work for my kids.  Also, the kids take turns leading activities which was a little distracting.  You are actually watching their class take place.  The leader would say, who wants to lead?  Kids raise their hands and she picks one.  After they lead, she says, ""Now who has something positive to say?""  I was like REALLY?  I paid $20 for this?  I think this is fine if your child has problems sharing, waiting to take turns or needs to see how to give positive comments.  This is not something my kids need nor is it what I paid for.  Icing on the cake - my kids hated it.  Which no matter what I thought was the nail in the coffin.  I would suggest getting a a basic beginner yoga dvd or have your child take a yoga class to get corrections and make sure they learn proper technique.",1366070400,2,1079,4.220588235294118
7794939,3,097992894X,"It was simpler and shorter than I had anticipated.  The stretches were good, and the interplay between the kids was nice as well, but I would have liked a few more poses.  There weren't any significant challenges for my kids.  Nonetheless, the photography and outdoor yoga setting are beautiful and it is a visually appealing dvd.",1364688000,,330,4.857142857142857

In Kids Teach Yoga, Flying Eagle, a 12 year old girl, Haley, leads a class of other children through a short, interactive, and accessible yoga session.

The Main Menu of the DVD offers the following options:
* Yoga Class
* About Eagles: a brief (1 minute) narration by Steve Engel of the Audubon Society featuring footage of eagles in the wild
* About Yoga Calm: a short (4 minutes) interview segment with founders Lynea and Jim Gillen
* Focusing Fun: another short (5 minutes) segment featuring psychologist Jeff Sosne, Ph. D., engaging in a ball activity with the children to enhance social and focus skills

The yoga class is taught in an outdoor garden setting. Haley has her mat placed at the front of a group of seven other children, who appear to range in age from approximately 8 to 11 (the DVD case recommends an age range of 4 to 11). The first five minutes of the practice involves warm-ups seated on the mat. Haley starts with what she calls a ""breathing ball""--this is an expanding toy sphere (similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hoberman-Mini-Sphere-Rings/dp/B0000E6I1F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hoberman: Mini Sphere - Rings</a>) which is used to mimic the in-out nature of the breath. First, Haley leads the breathing as one of her students counts, then she takes over the counting and allows a student to lead. She follows up with a second breathing exercise, belly breathing, where she instructs the class to lie on their backs and to use small rocks on their bellies to feel the motion of their breath. Remaining on their backs, the group performs leg circles--with Haley incorporating metaphors such as ""draw the sun""--and then rolls up and down a few times, coming to a modified boat hold. The seated segment concludes with additional breathwork and sending out ""warm thoughts,"" as Haley encourages the children to think of a favorite pet or special person.

The standing work begins with a partner exercise. Haley instructors her students to give each other a gentle push, first with the feet together, then apart, standing strong, like a mountain. Following this, she leads the group in a series of sun salutations, showing how to modify each of the postures but also adding side plank to the end of the flow. The group then moves away from their mats for an exercise called the tree circle: with legs in tree pose, they hold hands to form swaying trees. Remaining in the circle, they perform eagle pose and move into ""flying,"" or warrior 3 with clasped hands. To conclude the balance work, Haley brings the students back to their mats for tree pose, which they hold for 10 seconds on each side, and ""eagle story,"" which is a short vinyasa moving through several different postures as the eagle leaves the nest seeking fish.

With approximately 3.5 minutes left to the practice, Haley announces that it's time to start cooling down. She has the students come down to their backs for a lying twist. After this, she gives them a few seconds to get comfortable however they would like to prepare for the final story. This relaxation sequence involves Haley leading the students through a visualization of eagles in the Grand Canyon and one of the students, Rylie, singing her brief ""Eagle in the Sky"" invocation, with the total practice time being approximately 18.5 minutes.

The students participating are of different sizes, races (the DVD case notes that Rylie is Native American), and levels of ability. I have no question that this yoga class would appeal to children, although I believe that the age range on the DVD starts a bit too low; I'm not sure that the session would hold a four year old's attention. For slightly older kids, however, especially in a small group setting such as a classroom, this DVD would be an ideal tool for fun, flexibility, and focus.",1302307200,4,4005,4.9171597633136095
7794941,5,097992894X,"Yoga isn't just for adults - in fact kids do this type of thing naturally in their everyday activities as they play and tumble through life.

What this beautiful DVD adds is the fun and discipline of actual Yoga moves taught by kids and done by kids that bring calmness, stillness, muscle strength, breathe control and emotional control to today's overstressed children. In addition, for those kids who don't get enough exercise through play and sports, Yoga provides an invaluable way to keep them healthy, flexible, calm and centered throughout their day.

I see the flexibility that my grandchildren enjoy and wished someone had taught me the Yoga lifestyle when I still could move like they do! Do your kids and grand kids a big favor, get them hooked on Yoga early - this DVD is a great start.",1299283200,,798,4.733812949640288
7794942,5,097992894X,"The first time we watched this DVD, my son (who is 3 1/2) was a little hesitant, but after a surprisingly short period of time, he jumped right in and started trying out the positions.  I thought this was a great workout- it's lead by a young girl named Haley, who is 12 years old, and all of the other exercisers in the workout are also children, ages 4-11. I think this kid-lead atmosphere is really appealing for kids to watch and it definitely made my son want to participate. The yoga positions aren't overly complicated ones, and Haley does a great job of demonstrating them, making it really easy to follow along.

This DVD is a great tool for getting your kids up and moving, and if they're new to yoga, I think this would be a great introduction. The workout itself is fairly short, only 20 minutes long, so they aren't going to get bored and lose interest. My son actually asked to do it twice this afternoon!

Disclosure: I received a complimentary copy of this DVD from the company, to review for myself. I was under no obligation to post a positive review and was not compensated in any other way.",1296086400,,1110,4.431372549019608
7794943,5,097992894X,"I love how well rounded this kids yoga DVD is. It includes kids leading yoga, easy to follow poses, kids giving each other compliments, relaxation, guided imagery, etc. The music in the background is very calming as well. I can't wait to us this in the kids yoga groups that I lead!",1295222400,2,282,4.4423076923076925
