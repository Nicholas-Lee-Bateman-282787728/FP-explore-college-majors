1419464,4,B00005AVZQ,"This DVD contains particular rarities such as The Beau Brummels doing ""Don't Talk To Strangers"" and The Miller-Goldberg Band doing ""The Mother Song"", which was probably Steve Miller's first TV appearance, in December 1965.

I took DVD Volumes 5-8 on holiday to Rhode Island from Europe last year and I found that the DVD played perfectly well on the hotel room's DVD player.  However, although I can play DVD Volumes 1-4 and 9-12 perfectly well on my laptop computer, I cannot play Volumes 5-8 at all.  When I click on any of the options, I get a very fast skipping of the sound, with no picture except the title page, even with expanded memory installed.  Is this particular DVD too technically ambitious or is there a bad set of microprocessors out there?",1106697600,5,757,4.712121212121212
1419465,5,B00005AVZQ,"I remeber Hullabaloo and Shindig as a kid growing up, It didn't stay to long on ABC. I bought the dvd and was amazed and how good it looked after almost 40 years! And much to my surprise that there was a bonus of another 18 performances, my favorite was the Shangri-las they were great. I hope the put out the rest of the series. Talk about some great memories",1078272000,9,360,4.1571428571428575
1419466,1,B00005AVZQ,"Caveat emptor with this title.  I have tried FOUR separate DVD copies, all shrink-wrapped (but not factory-sealed), from two different sources, and everyone has been defective in the exact same way.  It's impossible to progress beyond the main menu screen without the whole thing freezing up and random bits of sound being heard.  I keep returning copies and hoping for refunds -- don't know where to lay the blame for this problem, but if I couldn't have evidence that one of these disks played as designed, I wouldn't buy it.

2006 update:  Ah-ha, I have since discovered that the problem is that my DVD player, a Zenith from 2000, is simply too ""old"" to process certain DVDs recorded with DVD-R coding or other elements.  Some studios press discs using shortcuts and this locks up my machine.  I can't play a whole range of DVDs on it. What a shuck.  Once again, it doesn't pay to be a pioneer with new technology -- something inevitably makes your investment obsolete before you get the full benefit from it.",1043884800,19,1012,4.7102272727272725
1419467,4,B00005AVZQ,"I was just 7 or 8 years old when NBC debuted their version of the ""Shindig"" series (was too young to watch). Frankly speaking, this show was slightly better because it had almost something for every taste, ranging from ""middle of the road"" acts to the big rock acts of the period.
Although the original video masters don't exist anymore (shame on NBC), the quality of both picture and sound is great. This was my very first DVD purchase (having just bought a DVD/VCR deck), and I'm glad it had to be a TV classic.",1040428800,10,513,4.410526315789474
1419468,3,B00005AVZQ,"I was surprised how weak the picture quality was on this DVD; it seemed much BETTER on video versions I have seen. So it's great stuff, and if the other DVDs have better quality I may keep it in my collection.",1032393600,4,209,4.121951219512195
1419469,4,B00005AVZQ,"Some of this is almost too good to be true: Brian Epstein interviewing Andrew Loog Oldham, the Kinks, the Animals, the Rolling Stones, the Remains, the Zombies, the Beau Brummels, Marianne Faithfull --- it's hard to know whwre to stop! The David McCallum episode alone is worth the price.
Even the bad stuff --- Hullabaloo dancers trying to break into recording, Peter Noone singing Dylan, Frankie and Annette doing the Freddie with Freddie and the Dreamers etc. --- is charming. And kudos to the company for not doing a ""highlights"" package and giving us entire episodes.
If any part of your youth is in the 60s, you'll want to open a cold beer and press ""play"". Warning: it's insanely addictive, and you'll end up losing a few hours sleep. A real treat.",1023580800,20,755,4.7272727272727275
1419470,4,B00005AVZQ,"This DVD Is a must for PETULA CLARK fans. It features the episode in which she was the first hostess in 1965 ,and she can be seen singing her hits ""I know a place"" and ""Round every corner"".The production is if course very dated ,and the picture quality is not brilliant ,but as good as you can get from the original source",998870400,11,322,4.209677419354839

7936100,1,B00005AVZQ,"Hullabaloo was a great show but this is not a great DVD.  It is possibly as good as the source material, but in the 21st  Century we are used to a certain quality that is entirely absent in this product.  The DVD is extremely grainy, often out of focus, and the audio warbles.  Save your $130 for something that would not be so painful to watch.",1451692800,,345,4.181818181818182
7936101,5,B00005AVZQ,"My dad enjoyed watching the shows, since he remembers watching as a kid.  And I could get his perspective since it was entirely new to me.  I never to know what some of those groups looked liked~",1419638400,,195,4.243243243243243

7936103,5,B00005AVZQ,"Ed Sullivan was one of the few American shows that let performers perform live. Too bad Hullabaloo did not always do so. But it's fun anyway. This one has Frankie Avalon, the Beau Brummels, Chad and Jeremy, Petula Clark, the Everly Brothers, Marianne Fatithfull, Freddie and the Dreamers, Annette Funicello, Dobie Gray, the Kingsmen, the Kinks, Brenda Lee, the Lovin' Spoonful, the Outsiders, the Rolling Stones, the Brothers Four, the Young Rascals, Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels.",1356739200,,486,5.243589743589744
7936104,4,B00005AVZQ,"First off, if you're going to buy any one of the three DVDs that are available in this set; this is the one to get.  Song for song, and performance for performance, this compilation captures the ""Best Of..."" Hullabaloo.  The Rolling Stones performance of ""Get Off My Cloud"", alone, makes this ""the one"" to have.

But, recognize that most of these performances are ""canned"" and that that the presentation is nothing short of corny.  Try to imagine the Lovin Spoolful singing ""May the Bird of Paradise Fly Up Your Nose"" surrounded by franticly gyrating dancers!  But, it was the mid-sixties, after all; and the frug, jerk and pony were actually wild dances performed in go-go boots by hormonally-charged teenagers.  Anyway, if you were born in the early 1950s, you know exactly what I mean.

So, take it for what it is: a period piece that captures the essence of music in the transitional mid-sixties...when you could let your hair down even if it was just barely over your ears.",1260230400,6,978,4.7514792899408285
