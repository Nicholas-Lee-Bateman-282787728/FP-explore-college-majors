5130075,1,B008412UVO,This movie contained very little in the way of a storyline.  Acting is normal for a typical David DeCoteau film.,1348358400,2,112,4.6
5130076,1,B008412UVO,"Anything, Everything by D. Cocteau is AWFUL!  Not GAY! No talent. No story. Nothing. Worst ""acting,"" can't even call it acting. No entertainment value!  There is no word or words to describe how bad he is at ""movie making.""",1347840000,6,223,4.6923076923076925
5130077,1,B008412UVO,"WOW
usually something good to say, but no, this was just terrible!
Was a spur of the moment buy ""on demand"" and boy what a waste.
The script, the acting, the sets all low rent/low budget.  Why does a piece of crap like this command the same fee to purchase or rent as a big budget movie.  My bad for being suckered in...
I have never written any review or comment on anything but the director and actors should all go home to their respective samll towns with their tails between their legs for this piece of crap and get a real job.
Absoulute garbage!!!",1347148800,6,554,4.266666666666667

8524934,1,B008412UVO,"Poor acting, action is fake, fighting is phony, the worst B movie ever, all no name actors in flick",1518393600,,99,4.2631578947368425

8524940,2,B008412UVO,What else can be said about all of the 1313 movies. They all look alike and they all suck. Some good eye candy is all the movies have to offer.,1420070400,2,143,3.8
8524941,3,B008412UVO,"Where to begin?  The guys are all very hot and never once don a shirt and always wear tight shorts.  The villainess is lovely and treacherous.  The scenes tend to be long, drawn out, and pointless.  The plot is there but a bit ill-defined.  The rating would surely be PG, as there is nothing more than a kiss in terms of physical contact.  This is pure DeCoteau, and if you've seen another one of his films, you know exactly what you're getting.  If you haven't, and you're curious, give it a chance.",1401667200,2,500,4.369565217391305
8524942,1,B008412UVO,"I can now with confidence say; this is by far the most terrible movie all time, hands down.
To bad Amazon doesn't have negative star. I've seen some bad movies but this takes the price.
Man it was BAD.",1371168000,3,201,4.17948717948718
