724670,5,6303861369,"There's something very zen-like about this show.  I've loved it since I was a kid.  The dialogue is brilliant in its simplicity at times.  Very aware people were writing this, I think.  Directors/writers include Sam Peckinpaw, other luminaries (curious that Peckinpaw should evince such tenderness in his writing on the Rifleman and then go on to make such violent and brutal films).  The extent of the affection tough Lucas shows Mark is quite incredible for the 50's/early 60s.  This is like no other 1950's show, that's for sure.  Chuck Connors managed to perfectly balance drama with a tongue-in-cheek sensibility.  Some episodes are light, others most profound.

Lucas McCain is the toughest hombre ever, and yet he is as wise as a sage and plants marigolds all around the ranch-house and actually holds and kisses his son (remember Jim Anderson? I loved Father Knows Best too but Jim reserved his hugs and kisses for Princess and Kitten, poor Bud had to be content with shaking hands).  At other times Lucas is funny and mischievous- Chuck Connors did a really fantastic job of making this guy seem straightforward and yet complex.  But best of all are the outtakes with the cast cussing, playing practical jokes, etc.  I love this set and intend to get more volumes as they come out.",1014508800,55,1290,4.86697247706422
724671,5,6303861369,"This four-volume set of ""The Rifleman"" episodes would be a great addition to your video collection.  It contains 20 shows - each complete with their opening and closing credits.  Details are given at the end of  this review.
(NB: If you cannot justify buying the full set, the four  tapes are also for sale as individual items.)
""The Rifleman""  was one of the best Western series broadcast in those classic days when TV  was proud to be black & white.  It starred Chuck Connors as ""Lucas  McCain"" - a widower determined to make a fresh start in life in New  Mexico, along with his young son, Mark (played by Johnny Crawford).
Lucas carried a modified Winchester with a large ring mechanism that  cocked the rifle by lever action.  Viewers got a clear idea how it worked  at the start of each episode - as the opening credits showed Lucas firing  off a volley of shots while striding purposefully down Main Street.
Most shows had Lucas using his Winchester either to protect his own  land, or to help the marshal rid the town of desperadoes.  Inevitably this  also gave Lucas an opportunity to teach young Mark the differences between  right and wrong.
The quality of picture and sound on all these tapes is  superb.  The selected shows are ranged from the very first episode (from  1958, when Mark was 12 - and defenceless against baddies) through to the  Fifth Season in 1962 (when Mark was a teenager looking to fight his own  battles).  My own favourites are the early shows, which were written and  directed by a young Sam Peckinpah.  However, the standards are consistently  high throughout.  I personally bought Volume One first - then Volume Two -  and finally Volumes Three and Four.  Looking back, I could have saved some  cash by buying the box set in the first place - and that is my  recommendation to you.  Here are the details: . . . .
Volume One (from  Season One) Sharpshooter (the first episode, with Dennis Hopper & Leif  Erickson) - Home Ranch (with Harold J Stone) - End of a Young Gun (with  Michael Landon) - The Marshal (with Paul Fix & Warren Oates) - Duel of  Honor (with Cesare Danova & Jack Elam)
Volume Two (from Seasons One  & Two) The Angry Gun (with Vic Morrow) - The Sheridan Story (with  Lawrence Dobkin & Royal Dano) - The Money Gun (with John Dehner) - The  Mind Reader (with John Carradine & Michael Landon) - Bloodlines (with  Buddy Hackett, Warren Oates & Denver Pyle)
Volume Three (from  Seasons Two & Four) Day of the Hunter - The Vaqueros (with Martin  Landau) - Knight Errant (with Lawrence Dobkin) - The Long Goodbye (with  Edgar Buchanan) - High Country (with James Coburn & Ellen Corby)
Volume Four (from Seasons Four & Five)  Man from Salinas (with  Robert Culp) - Two Ounces of Tin (with Sammy Davis Jr.) - The Deadly Image  - Waste: Parts I & II.",945388800,64,2794,4.531187122736418

724833,5,6303861369,"Here's the deal, Lucas McCain is incredible with a rifle. In fact, he has rigged his rifle so he can twirl it around and get off repeated shots in a very short amount of time.

A man of peace, Lucas moves to New Mexico to start a new life after his wife dies, and he is left with his son, Mark, to raise in what he hopes will be a new and better kind of world, one with less violence. Unfortunately, that's not the world he and his son live in. They live in a violent world, a dangerous world, a world where a repeating rifle is an absolute necessity.

This is a great series. I watched it in real time when I was a child. I've been watching it again now, these many years later.

The first episode is courtesy of that wonderful Western director Sam Peckinpah. The first episode alone is worth the cost of the box set.",1180137600,8,818,4.1
724834,4,6303861369,"For the show itself I give 5 stars.

For picking episodes (based on guest stars who later became big ?) from the first 5 seasons and putting them out as set one  I give 0 stars. So it can only get 4 overall.

It seems all the sets follow the same process, and that will make for some interesting continuity jumps from set to set. Young Mark is going to grow up, AND down!

A pity, but never mind, I am glad to be able to see rifleman again. I remembered it for two things; the relationship between father and son and of course THAT really nifty rifle!

Set one at least, is well worth its purchase price.",1163462400,12,604,4.084745762711864
724835,1,6303861369,"Hi:  Most of us 50's and 60's kids love these shows.  Especially the Rifleman. These sets would sell better if they were in season order.  Take my word for it.  I definitely would buy the whole set like I did for Branded another Great Chuck Conners show.

724839,4,6303861369,"Chuck Connors, Johnny Crawford and the Chuck's rapid-fire long gun are the featured performers of these episodes.  I watched this show five days a week when I was a grade-schooler and I'm delighted to find it holds up pretty well.  Naturally some episodes are more worthwhile than others (in those days they knocked out thirty episodes or more per year), but overall quality is high for half-hour weekly fare.  It's family entertainment that won't bore the not-so-young'uns.
Sam Peckinpah created this before moving on to feature films, and he utilized his youth on a California ranch to add realism to the show's atmosphere.  Recommended viewing, especially the first couple seasons.",1067385600,17,684,5.1909090909090905

The next 4 seasons will follow in 2014. You can pay thru Amazon on this site also. Me TV has only shown about half of these episodes and they are repeating alot. I bought these 20 episode box sets offered on Amazon also ($100+). I guess Amazon can't sell the new release yet.

7854789,3,6303861369,"The ""Product Details"" section curiously does not mention how many episodes per DVD. Call me crazy, but I like to know what I am getting when I make a purchase, including the names of the episodes.

I had to research other sites to figure out not only which episodes are listed, but how many.

Here is what I determined, for those still trying to figure it out:
A ""volume"" is one DVD with 5 episodes, usually from the same season, but not always.
A ""boxed set"" is made of 4 volumes, for a total of 20 episodes.

Episode lists by volume may be found on some other Rifleman websites.

There are 6 boxed sets currently in release, for a total of 120 episodes available for purchase. There are 48 episodes not currently released.

Also, I cannot believe that none of the other reviewers address the incredibly steep price! At $500 for a new set which includes only 20 episodes, that's $25 per episode! I love the show, but I can't justify that price...

For the producers of the DVD, it is absolutely ridiculous not to release the DVDs in broadcast order.",1337731200,35,1050,4.471204188481676

7854793,5,6303861369,"Are you tired of watching men on TV who act more like children than men? Are you tired of watching effeminate male figures portrayed as buffoons whose only purpose in life is to be ridiculed by their wives and mocked by their children? Are you fed up with seeing fathers who lack logic, intelligence, and courage? If you said yes to any of these questions than the Rifleman is a show you will be interested in. Chuck Connors plays Lucas McCain, a single parent who is raising his young son in the rugged Southwest during the later part of the nineteenth century. McCain embodies many of the characteristics that we used to admire in American men: courage, leadership, sacrifice, loyalty, chivalry, fairness, and the ability to remain calm amidst tragedy and difficult circumstances. The McCain character reminds me of the World War II vets I knew growing up. These men reflected the old-fashioned male persona that made America the greatest country in the world. Every episode of the Rifleman contains a very complex situation which necessitates the need for Lucas McCain to demonstrate incredible courage and clear-thinking in order to bring about the best resolution. McCain's main goal in life is to ""bring up his boy right"" and to model for his son Mark the most desirable traits needed to make good moral decisions and to understand the difference between right and wrong. On an entertaining note, you have to love his Winchester rifle. This gun could fire something like 8 rounds in 2 and half seconds. McCain is more precise and deadly with his rifle than any other man is with a pistol. The show was on 5 seasons from 1958 through 1963. During its first year, the Rifleman finished fourth in the TV ratings, which is pretty good for a first season. By the second season it dropped to fourteenth place. The remaining three seasons did not finish in the top 25. I'm not sure why this is because all the episodes seem pretty good to me. I have two complaints about the product. First of all, I think it is ridiculous the way the distributor packaged the episodes. Each volume set is a mixture of all five seasons. Rather than release a complete set of all the seasons separately, they selected a handful of episodes from each season and packaged them into a volume set. My next problem is with the availability of the product. These DVDs are near impossible to obtain. Volumes 1 and 2 are no longer available. You might be able to get Volumes 3 and 4 if you are lucky and Volumes 5 and 6 can be obtained if you look hard enough. I'm not sure if this is due to the shows popularity or if the distributor did not anticipate active sales and only burned a limited number of copies. That being said, I highly recommend The Rifleman and I encourage you to try to purchase any of the volume sets. Let's face it, The Rifleman would never be on TV today because it stands for everything the contemporary cultures despises.",1188432000,21,2919,4.626204238921002
