8188188,5,B000P1QO0Y,"This video is money well spent!  I am a competition shooter and concealed permit holder.  Before watching this video, I thought I had everything figured out for any situation but, you cannot just brandish a firearm in every situation so that got me thinking.  Most items that have a handle or grip on them can be considered a weapon by the authorities, and can get you locked up.  A flashlight is not a weapon but a tool for lighting and should be regarded as such. However, this video shows many ways of protecting yourself using a tacticle flashlight that could easily save you life or just stop a lesser threat from escalating.  He shows many ways to stike and many ways to drop your aggressor.  Purchase this video and train yourself, your wife/girlfriend, or your kids. Oh, also, if you have read the review by Mr. Harris, he states that you could hurt yourself by trying to perform the moves! If you are going to buy into that garbage then you might as well let your attacker hurt you as well.",1265587200,6,999,4.49171270718232
