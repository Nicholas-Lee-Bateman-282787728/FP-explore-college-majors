The only other options is to use the ""karaoke"" track or just have the regular CD version of the song play. The images are phenomenal - the video editor who made this is very gifted - but the subtitles showing the lyrics to the song (the whole reason one would get this product) has only one setting - white letters very small.
For such limited options available on the lyrical edge and the limited number of songs per DVD It seems a bit much to me. I have DVD A and will not be getting any others. Glad I got a deal on it at the Christian bookstore...
My advice? borrow another church's to see it before you buy it. It might work for your church - it didn't for ours. (both regular services and youth services)",1054166400,8,870,4.153846153846154
