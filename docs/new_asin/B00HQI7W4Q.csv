6197670,5,B00HQI7W4Q,"This DVD of Mr. Root is a masterpiece and soon to be a classic. I am a long-time Slipknot/Stone Sour fan and when I learned that my favorite guitarist had this DVD available, I knew that I had to have it within my collection. He is very, very talented and such a down to earth human being in his own right. Thank you Amazon and thank you Jim Root for this amazing video. Well worth the money.",1398384000,,392,4.103896103896104

6197672,5,B00HQI7W4Q,"I bought this DVD for my boyfriend because he is a huge Jim Root fan. I've only seen maybe five minutes of it, but from what I did see, he talks about what any huge fan of him would want to hear; what growing up was like, early band days with Stone Sour and Slipknot etc. This is an awesome DVD because after my boyfriend watched some of it, he couldn't stop thanking me for it c:",1444780800,,380,3.948051948051948

6197676,5,B00HQI7W4Q,I think this is a great product. Jim is very clear when showing you how to play the songs and techniques. I'd recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Jim Root.,1430784000,,160,3.878787878787879
6197677,5,B00HQI7W4Q,"This is a must have for a Slipknot fan. Dude snaps you off a piece of Slipknot from his perspective about the band, Paul and himself.  And if you play guitar it's worth more than you paid. Enjoy.",1426550400,,195,4.131578947368421

6197679,5,B00HQI7W4Q,Jim Root is always good value. The first disc is more about his History with bands and where he is at now. Actually he's only in Slipknot now but the 2nd disc has a few lessons. It's definitely NOT a songbook type of DVD.,1416873600,,221,4.045454545454546
