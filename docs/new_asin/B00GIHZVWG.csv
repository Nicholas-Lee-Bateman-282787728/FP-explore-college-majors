6078247,4,B00GIHZVWG,"A TALE OF STRUGGLE, MISFORTUNE, IDENTITY, AND A TYPE OF FAITH

Actual French name ""La Religieuse"" is based on a book by Denis Diderot and remake of the 1966 movie, all by the same name.  Though this story employs the context of a young woman being forced into a convent, it represents a greater meaning of being forced into a path, vocation, or life that one didn't choose.  Neither the book nor the film were intended to project these events as typical convent life.  The story develops at a more methodic pace with a very natural form of conversation.  For those looking for casual entertainment on a Friday night, this might not meet that description.  Those who love French cinema will know more what to expect.  Regardless of the pace, the story is well constructed and makes the viewer care for Suzanne's well being and the outcome of her path.  The cinematography is beautiful, but can be shadowy or bleak at times.  A few beautiful estates and convents are on display as well!

THE PLOT (no spoilers):  Set in 1763-65, Suzanne Semonin is the youngest of three sisters.  Elements of her story are recounted in flashback via the medium of her diary.  Suzanne explains how her parents sought fortuitous matches for the three girls.  She further suggests an element of fate as she describes how a single sour note she played on the harpsichord at a party draws attention from her sister's potential suitor onto her own attractive self (ruining that particular opportunity).  Suzanne explains how this small event is just the start in a series of dominoes that will befall her over the next two years.  After the party, Suzanne protests to her mother that she had no intention of distracting her sister's suitors and that she loves god, not these young men.  This comment is first mistaken, then purposefully used as a pretext later on.  Suzanne is placed temporarily at a convent while her sisters are finally married.  After the first two marital arrangements prove financially ruinous for the family, pressure is applied on Suzanne to formally become a nun, avoiding another marriage they feel they can no longer afford.  Unfortunately this is a life Suzanne has decided is not for her. However, family secrets are revealed that leave Suzanne little choice but to acquiesce.  This all occurs at the start of the film in order to set up the actual story.  Strange turns of event and misfortunes take over from there and will bring her to a radically different place while testing her faith.

OTHER THOUGHTS:  The performances were outstanding and include stars Pauline Etienne, Isabella Huppert, and Louise Bourgoin.  I know the old film was well beloved, so I don't know how fans of the old will receive this remake.  However, it definitely is beautifully shot and has a more natural style of acting.  Suzanne is also given a somewhat stronger personality in this version which modern audiences might appreciate.",1423008000,19,2918,4.854251012145749

6078256,5,B00GIHZVWG,"Denis Diderot wrote La Religieuse (The Nun) in 1780 and the power in this story remains intact in this screen adaptation by Guillaume Nicloux (who also directs) and J&eacute;rme Beaujour. Diderot was a radical freethinker, rejecting conventional dogma and associated himself with some of the most enlightened philosophers of his age. His books were burned and Diderot himself served three months in Vincennes prison in retaliation for his attacks on the conventional morality of the day. Some of his books were considered so radical that they were banned until after his death.

The story takes place in France, in the 1760s. Born to a bourgeois family, Suzanne (Pauline Etienne) is a beautiful young girl with a natural talent for music. Despite her faith, she is dismayed when her parents send her off to a convent, expecting her to become a nun. Suzanne first resists the rules of the convent, but soon finds out that she is an illegitimate child, leaving her no other option than to pronounce her vows and suffer the consequences of her mother's sin. She soon wants to escape the religious path and is trying to revoke her vows when the Mother Superior, who had brought her comfort and solace, dies. Her successor, Sister Christine (Louise Bourgoin), turns out to be a sadistic and cruel Mother Superior, inflicting the worst forms of humiliation upon Suzanne, such as depriving her of food and clothing. Suzanne is finally transferred to another convent, where she discovers another kind of Mother Superior (Isabelle Huppert), who develops an inappropriate affectionate bond with her. The story is one of a woman trying to resist imposed religious values, revealing the dehumanizing effect of cloistered life.

Pauline Etienne is radiant as Suzanne and as always Isabelle Huppert delivers a riveting performance. The costumes by Anas Romand are especially fine as is the musical score by Max Richter. This is a superb film on every level. Grady Harp, June 15",1434240000,4,1963,5.055555555555555

However, her character; her mind; her direct, speaking out & honesty leads to very severe encounters with some individuals in the monasteries.

A bit of a viewer's guide suggestion, because this film is mostly one large flashback as chronicled in the reading of our nun's journal be sure to pay attention in the beginning (no sneak snack breaks). There are many possible endings of which my fav two are a forgiving, compassionate, nonjudgmental vs. ""pay-back-time"" amongst, of course, what each viewer sees.",1432339200,2,769,4.961240310077519

6078263,4,B00GIHZVWG,"If you have had any curiosity about what goes on behind the walls of a convent in the 18th century, this is the movie to see.  Actually it reminded me very much of the recent movie that touches on the same subject, the Polish movie, ""Ida.""  The main differences would be in the young novitiates: one was entirely willing to devout her life to convent life, while the other was willing to sacrifice all she could to leave convent life.  It's an exceptionally well made movie with excellent performances by the young Pauline Etienne, and the veteran actress, Isabelle Huppert.

6078269,5,B00GIHZVWG,"One Source, One Force God, that SuperWhiteLight Himself, is responsible for all physical forces and all metaphysical forces and even life itself. And because we were made in His Image and Likeness, is why mans politics and religions are a Satanic deception to cause all who pay attention to Satans teachings thorough his many services on Earth to sin, and why we needed what Gods only Son could do for us through Jesus Gift of perpetual forgiveness.

Suzanne knew this too as she made it apparent that God had reached her before Satans religious institutes had corrupted her heart & soul as that evil establishment has done to so many in the past with complete impunity.

 When I was 8 years old, I went through what Suzanne went through all by myself, just like her. God told me that; He and His Son Jesus, our Savior, have absolutely NOTHING whatsoever to do with mans politics, religions or cults, and I was sure happy to hear that.

This is why religion is evil, turning little minds into evil minds. Even so the wisdom in this book is bread for men and wombmen. Romans 8:1There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. Matthew 23:8 But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, evenChrist; and all ye are brethren.

  For instance, as an example, take the Bible;  William Tyndales compilation of Holy Scriptures into his manuscript, didn't make that coveted book of Gods Wisdom a BIBLE.

 The word Bible is a Greek word meaning Paper or Papyrus  so the term Bible did not become popular until Tyndale was martyred and TheKing James Version(KJV), commonly known as theAuthorized Version(AV) orKing James Bible(KJB), is an English translationof the Christian Biblefor the Church of England which wasbegun in 1604 and completed in 1611. First printed by the Kings Printer Robert Barker, this was the third translation into English to be approved by the English Church authorities. The first was the Great Bible,commissioned in the reign of King Henery VIII(1535), and the second was the Bishops Bibleof 1568

 The King James Bible is a descendent of William Tyndales great translation of the century before. When King James commissioned his Bible he gave specific instructions to the translators to use the best from the Bishops' Bible, Tyndale's Bible, Coverdale's, Matthew's, and Geneva Bibles. In the preface to the 1611 authorized version the King Jamess translation committees said they did not seek ""to make a new translation, nor yet to make of a bad one a good one, but to make a good one better"".

 The Great Bible was prepared by Myles Coverdale, working under commission of Thomas, Lord Cromwell, Secretary to Henry VIII and Vicar General. In 1538, Cromwell directed the clergy to provide ""one book of the bible of the largest volume in English, and the same set up in some convenient place within the said church that ye have care of, whereas your parishioners may most commodiously resort to the same and read it.""

The Great Bible includes much from the Tyndale Bible, with the objectionable features revised. AsTyndales manuscriptwas incomplete, TheTyndale Biblegenerally refers to the body of scriptural translationsby William Tyndale ie his compiled manuscript of scripture. However, Tyndales Bible is credited with being the first English translation of that Pure Language

  Now 610 years before God Himself put on flesh and stole His way in to this world as a thief in the night through two poor God loving people , Joseph and Mary, when she gave birth to Him in that manger in Bethlehem, God alluded to Zephaniah in the Torah; Zephaniah 3: 9 when God said;  For then will I turn to the people a Pure Language, that they may all call upon the name of the LORD, (Jesus) to serve Him with one consent.

 This is very important because Tyndale always made sure that each translation he made had to work equally well in this new and Pure Language of English directly from the Latin, Hebrew and Greek texts. Furthermore it was the first English biblical translation that was mass-produced as a result of new advances in the art of printing.

 So the termTyndale's Bible,is not correct, because Tyndale never published a complete Bible. Prior to his execution Tyndale had only finished translating the entire New Testamentand roughly half of the Old Testament. Of the latter, the Pentateuch, Jonah,and a revised version of the book of Genesis were published during his lifetime.

 His other Old Testament works were first used in the creation of the Matthew Bibleand also heavily influenced every major English translation of the Bible that followed.

Coverdale translated the remaining books of the Old Testament and Apocryphafrom the Latin Vulgateand German translations, rather than working from the original Greek, Hebrewand Aramaictexts.

 You don't have to be an Einstein or a 12 dimensional mathematician to be able to understand what I am sharing with you. When Tyndales scriptural manuscript became known as the Bible Satan grabbed on to that word, then all the plagiarizing started, first by the Catholic cult, then the so called Renaissance  or Protestant Era fell in and wrote so many different versions of the Bible that it did the Devils serving through confusion, as he is the evil king of deceits.

 I just believe Dr. John Milewski is saying the very same things to me as God has said to me in my younger days.

 In the past, science has been prostituted to do the bidding of politics and greedy business people. This is what got us in to our present environmental and health problems. Believe and Live, or doubt and die your choice my friends. Know Jesus, know Peace, No Jesus, no Peace! Its been a proven fact replicated by many people from our ancestors to our present modern day brothers and sisters;

Great eagerness in the pursuit of wealth, pleasure, or honor, cannot exist without sin. So consequently war is sweet to those who have not experienced it!

So Know Jesus, know Peace, No Jesus, no Peace!  Suzanne received her inter strength from the Holy Ghost Who is according to Gods will, our only Teacher & Comforter.  John 14:26 But the Comforter,which isthe Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in My name, He shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.

Thank You Lord Jesus!",1424390400,2,6365,4.852913968547641
6078270,4,B00GIHZVWG,"I found this to be a fascinating movie.....beautifully photographed and acted, but there were parts which were vague, as has been pointed out, and I believe, after going over certain sections a few times I figured it out....so this review is a bit of a spoiler , so those who want to figure it out for themselves, don't read it.
  As has been noted by others the story revolves around a young girl who is coerced to entering a cloister against her will because her parents can no longer afford to keep her at home due to her sisters marriages which left them financially ruined. She believes they're sending her away because she made a mistake in her Harpsichord performance and because one of her sister's suitors showed an interest in her.
Actually the story gets more complicated.....though she doesn't know it she isn't the biological daughter of her mother's husband. A priest friend of the family disclosed this to her. It seems her Mother had an affair with a wealthy man while she was married and she was the result of this union. Shocked and with nowhere to turn she enters the Cloister against her wishes. She struggles to fit in but finally when it come to take her Vows she refuses....not because she doesn't love God, which she does but because she doesn't have the vocation. She leaves, but at home again, being locked in her room, she decides to give in and return to the Cloister. When her much-appreciated Abbess dies she falls under the hands of a cruel, sadistic Abbess who makes her life a living hell.
  During all this she has kept a Memoir in which all she has learned about her parentage and coercion to enter the Cloister....and all she has gone through. She decides to get a lawyer to help her get out and gives him her Memoir to do whatever he can for her. He arranges for her to change convents while she awaits the Vatican to approve her laicization. The next cloister is another level of hell for her as the Lesbian Abbess falls in love with her and tries to impose herself on her. In the meantime the Lawyer tells her that the Memoir is with a Countess who is doing everything she can to help. During Confession it's revealed that the Abbess kisses her and tries to get in to bed with her. The priest is appalled and fearful for her safety. On the next visit he hands her a key to the back entrance and tell her that she is to be taken to her Protector.
  The next scene has her waking up in a lovely Chateaux and she goes out on the terrace and is greeted by a young man we saw very briefly in a scene in the 1st third of the movie with his father who was dying. This is one of the confusing parts as he introduces himself to her as the Marquis. She says ""Your father told me of your arrival."" He replies ""Was he your father?"" and she shakes her head yes. He tells her that her father waited for her before dying...and that he died during the night. THE END
  Well, I asked myself ...""Who is this young man?"" Is he a suitor? Is he a brother she never knew she had?
Then I rolled the film back to the 1st third and the scene with a sick old man in bed and this young man with the Memoir in his hands admitting it he had read it. The old man was apparently the girl's biological longed-for father. The young man was his son who would inherit the Marquis title on his father's passing. The old man tells his son that he found his love too late. The son says he would like to converse with him about it but the old man says....""read the memoir"".  Now this scene had no introduction as to who these people were! That's the confusing part. The scene just appeared and disappeared. It confused me because the sick old man bore a strong resemblance to the girl's mother's husband.....and I thought the young man was a brother to her who hadn't been mentioned before. I later, after rolling the film back and forth, I came to the conclusion that the Countess, who had tried so hard to help, made inquiries and had contacted the Marquis, and he never having known he had a daughter, made arrangements to have her come to live with
him. This was a problem in the film. Things may have been cut out in the editing but one shouldn't have had to go to the lengths I did to figure who these people were.
  So, the upshot was that on that fateful night when our heroine was whisked away to her ""Protector"" she was finally going to meet and live with her biological father, whom she had so long imagined what he looked like. So the ending made sense to me, finally. She had finally met and spoken with her father just before he died and she would live with her half-brother (the young man, who was now the Marquis.) Whew!! I had to really work for that one! But it was worth it, as it was a haunting film, wonderfully acted. But I only gave it 4 stars because of the confusion. Also, I had been a Cloistered Nun at one time and I have to say that what went on in those Cloisters bears no resemblance to what my experience had been (or any other cloistered Nuns I knew!) But I realize for the sake of Drama one has to embellish.....just the same I have to say that the Cloistered life is one of  self-sacrificing love of God and mankind. That's the real vocation.....not the hell which has been depicted.",1424044800,24,5218,4.307849133537207
