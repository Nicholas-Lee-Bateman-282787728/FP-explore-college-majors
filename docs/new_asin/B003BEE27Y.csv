4106245,4,B003BEE27Y,"I felt that this 30 for 30 was so open and honest. It really captured what this man was going through on the inside while so many judge what was happening on the outside. I would recommend this DVD to coaches, teachers, counselors, mentors, parents (I am a parent, counselor and mentor).

4106246,5,B003BEE27Y,"It doesnt matter if you are a fan of the Miami Dolphins or not and I say that with all sincerity! This is very moving, humbling, and inspiring. It takes you thru all the low points of Ricky Williams life on and off the field. I really don't know what else to say besides you must watch this film! Put this on your bucket list and order it now.

I watched this on tv but it was so good I needed it for the house to watch anytime.

This film makes you want to be the best person you can possibly be. Very inspirational!!!",1273190400,,519,3.980769230769231

8393566,5,B003BEE27Y,One of my favorite athletes of my generation.  This documentary really shows the ups and downs of Ricky. A man that really has changed his life and is doing something that he really loves. Glad he found that inner peace. Run Ricky Run!!!!!!!,1419552000,,241,4.604651162790698
8393567,5,B003BEE27Y,"As are all the 30 for 30 films this is a great documentary chronicling Ricky Williams battles with his demons and mental issues. Very good documentary, very interesting and being able to see athletes in vulnerable conditions such as this shows that they (athletes) suffer from the same things as many other people and they too have problems! Very well done 5 stars!",1403481600,,365,4.809523809523809
8393568,5,B003BEE27Y,"Ricky williams reminds me a lot of myself and this documentary proves that the guy might have been different, but he was very much sane and ""misunderstood""..Anybody who has missed this needs to check it out asap..it's one of the better 30 for 30 stories....",1390608000,,257,4.733333333333333
8393569,2,B003BEE27Y,"The story about Ricky Williams star-crossed entry into the NFL, the first half of his career and his shocking 'retirement' in 2004 has all the elements of a compelling sports drama.  Unfortunately, Sean Pamphilon's chronicle of Ricky's year away from football, when he went on a spiritual journey to deal with his profound anxiety and to find himself and his purpose, is a largely dull experience.

  It's expected that Pamphilon would have difficulty in trying to be introspective and revelatory with a subject that is reluctant to express more than one sentence at a time.  However, that doesn't really excuse the feeling that most of this feels like a lazy bull session over the course of several long, rainy afternoons.

  It is hard to turn away from any of the ""30 for 30"" series.  Alas, I probably had to stop and start four different times before I made it through this one.",1372291200,,882,4.75
8393570,5,B003BEE27Y,"The story of running back Ricky Williams's sort of ""lost years"". This is one of the better 30 by 30 films. The initial 10 minutes might be off putting to some - just from the style and direction of the documentary - but hang in there - it delivers. Thought provoking, honest and sympathetic to Williams as a human being. Watch it - I think you will like it.",1336435200,,357,4.188405797101449
8393571,5,B003BEE27Y,"This was a fantastic documentary about a man who was completely misunderstood. It was an interesting look into an athlete who was just different from what was expected both in good and bad ways. Dan Lebetard said it best saying that Unfortunately for Ricky, he was defined by one thing he did/does when he could not have been any different than what they wanted to defined him as. Great Watch! Totally Worth It! Buy!",1329004800,,416,4.635135135135135
8393572,5,B003BEE27Y,This definitely shined light on Ricky's situation for me! It was good to know some of what he was going through during this time. Worth a watch.,1292976000,,144,4.37037037037037
8393573,4,B003BEE27Y,Ricky is an amazing athlete a smart and pretty interesting guy. This film is worth watching but some of the others are better.,1287878400,,126,4.521739130434782
8393574,5,B003BEE27Y,"Excellent look at one of the least understood players of our time.  It shows Ricky as a kind person with no ego, who puts the interests of others ahead of his own.",1281830400,,163,4.09375
