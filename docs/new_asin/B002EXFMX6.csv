8368490,4,B002EXFMX6,"The movie was great. The only down side was that it also had actor's and the director's commentary. However, none of the commentaries were subtitled, as was the movie. The reasoning for this is difficult to figure out. Another thing I don't understand is the English translation of the title. The original Swedish title would have been more correctly translated as ""The Best Summer"". If you've seen the movie, one of the first things you will notice at the beginning is that Mrten describes the upcoming summer as ""the best summer in my life"".

Otherwise, a great movie. Has an element (the threatened suicide of the children near end) of ""Moonrise Kingdom"" in it.",1385251200,,664,4.824561403508772
8368491,5,B002EXFMX6,"This is a great film, suitable for all ages.  Set in 1958, it's full of whimsy and curiousness as two eleven year old foster children make the trip to a sleepy Swedish village to spend the summer holidays with a klutzy old bachelor who is virtually the town pariah.
All the performances are spot on and it is a good complement to My Life as a Dog (1985 - how time flies) and perhaps, although this is a much grittier, meatier film, Cross My Heart and Hope to Die (1994) It is interesting to note that Brasse Brannstrom - who has a supporting role in A Summer Tale as Sven(what a wet title, by the way - what was wrong with The Best Summer?)is a Swedish comedian and actor now co-wrote My Life as a Dog.
The final scenes of the film may be somewhat belaboured, but this film is great family viewing - and the kids are alright!
As an afterthought - the DVD I saw had no special features (not even chapter index) but the subtitles were fine. It is available commercially but you'll have to do some research.",1290384000,,1004,4.2565445026178015
