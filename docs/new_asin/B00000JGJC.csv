the rock& roller collector likes....

Live after Dead..... etc..",1055289600,,375,4.696969696969697
8290088,5,B00000JGJC,"Although the camera man didn't know what he was doing, this is a great collection (2 1/2 hours !!) of pure guitar magic from Michael. Every part of Michael's wonderful career is brought to life and burned at the frets for us. Songs from the beginning of his career, Piece of mind, through UFO hits and MSG greats like Captain Nemo and Into the Arena, to Contraband, and even new UFO. His band (Wriiten in the Sand lineup) does a great job supporting a great sounding video. To sum it up, though, Too many notes !!!!! I love it !! Rock on Michael !!!",987379200,,549,4.288461538461538
