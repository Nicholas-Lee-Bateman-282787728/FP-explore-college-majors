7796562,5,1565855949,"I picked this one up on sale threw the great courses mainly because I like the one professor.  Professor Cook is a great teacher that I came across from his course on Machiavelli, which I also highly recommend.  I had never had any background in Dante's Divine Comedy, yet I found myself wanting to continue watching this course all the way threw.  It is clear and explained in such a way anyone can comprehend it.  Very well done.",1445385600,,431,4.487179487179487
7796563,5,1565855949,"This is super helpful.  There is so much nuance in this great work, and there is a lot of reference to both world and church history at the time Dante was writing.  These video discussions are informative and made reading the books even more interesting.",1415750400,,254,4.622222222222222
7796564,5,1565855949,This is such a great course. It holds your interest and gives a close reading of many passages. It unpacks poetic meaning that I would not have found on my own reading. Both speakers are wonderful together each playing off the other. I really loved this.,1403654400,,254,4.543478260869565
