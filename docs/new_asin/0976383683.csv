7794714,5,0976383683,This is the best yoga DVD ever.  Dharma Mittra is so inspiring I actually look forward to practicing every day.  The discourses have helped me understand so much more/,1494028800,,167,4.724137931034483
7794715,5,0976383683,This is a wonderful push for your yoga level given by a master teacher.  Make sure you have level 1 down first!,1475452800,,111,4.045454545454546
7794716,5,0976383683,I use this dvd set daily as part of my practice. The entire set of level one and level two maha sadhana will give you a complete practice you can use for years to come. By using this set which comprises all the various forward and backward bends and twists it hits all the major movements in a complete asana practice while building upon each other for a beautiful total comprehensive set of asanas which prepare the practitioner for any yoga class. I recommend this set for the beginner as well as the accomplished practitioner. The pranayama and meditation segments are a beautiful addition to complete the practice. The excerpts this master yogi includes in both dvds are 50 years of wisdom he shares with his students to convey the true meaning of yoga.,1416873600,,757,4.656716417910448
7794717,3,0976383683,I am in very good shape and find most intermediate practices to be fairly easy but this one is definetly far advanced. If your new/intermediate do not bother even trying this and that is not meant to be a challenge. Some of the poses I really enjoy and find dynamic but their are some that are just really intense. I believe I'm looking for more of a flowing power yoga that strengthens muscle and constitutes a workout (which this obviously does) but without breaking a wrist. I'm sure the hard core yogi will jump on this review but this practice is definetly not intermediate and already assumes you've mastered more challenging positions rather than being instructive. I would recommend this to the person who is looking for an advanced practice to further their poses rather than someone wanting to learn them.,1274400000,6,815,4.787234042553192
7794718,3,0976383683,"Namaste,

This DVD has the feature of choosing between Intermediate and Advanced Intermediate practices. Within each of these, you can choose from 3 different practice lengths.

Although Dharma is very precise in his asanas, I found his approach to be too repetitious. The primary focus of all practice choices is the Shiva Namaskaar repeated over and over again in rounds. There are only a handful of poses woven into the repeating Shiva Namaskaar.

This offering is definitely for yogis solidly at the intermediate level or above. Yogis looking to expand on the variety of poses in their practice may want to consider other DVDs. Om.",1225411200,10,635,5.0285714285714285
7794719,2,0976383683,"I love the poster (you know, the famous one with the hundreds of poses), but the DVD is sorely lacking.  I am an  experienced yogi with a daily practice of Hatha Vinyasa, Yin, Ashtanga, and Kundalini, however I found this very hard to follow because of his heavy accent.  The sequencing and pace didn't appeal to me, either.",1218758400,,324,4.551724137931035
7794720,5,0976383683,"Dharma Mittra is a truly great presence in yoga.  His series is just what I needed to add something to my practice.  This particular DVD (part 2) is definitely not for beginners though.  He is also not so big on warm ups, so I add a few basic stretches to the beginning.  That said, I LOVE THIS DVD.  It has great time selections so you can do a 50ish minute practice, 70 or 85.  Too many DVDs are only 30 minutes- not enough for serious yoga.  This DVD is like having a real class at home.  I highly recommend it.",1200009600,15,514,4.07
7794721,5,0976383683,"I bought this DVD never expecting the results I got: my legs are toned, the salutation part is very aerobic and it really stretches my spine and abs.  A great workout!

A Note on The Seller: I wouldn't buy this DVD from InnerSelf Market, the DVD they sold me is defective and they don't have a customer service that returned my written messages.  They don't list a phone number either.",1198108800,9,385,4.4714285714285715
7794722,5,0976383683,I enjoy using the Maha Sadhana Level II DVD at home.  Dharma Mittra's directions are clear and easy to follow.  It is an intense series of Hatha yoga and I feel great when I'm done.  It feels like your in a private lesson with Dharma Mittra!,1161129600,8,241,4.195652173913044
7794723,5,0976383683,"With breathtaking (well, THAT's certainly a poor choice of words... ;) clarity, Sri Dharma outlines a challenging practice that will lead us straight into the right side of the heart, where the Divine resides.  The DVD covers all limbs of yoga, which really sets it apart from other yoga DVDs out there.  Sri Dharma's teachings are beautifully simple, and yet the practice laid out here is very challenging work!

I'd recommend this DVD and it's companion to anyone looking to really dig in and deepen their practice.  The special features where Dharma speaks to us about life on the path are particularly useful and moving.  I show them to my yoga students all the time!  Dharma is, as anyone will tell you, the teacher's teacher, a living light, and a rare gem: a true, true yoga master.",1161043200,8,789,4.7226277372262775
