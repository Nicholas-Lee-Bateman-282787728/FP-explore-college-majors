8599288,5,B00DYXB1MQ,"Draculas Orgy Of The Damned is great amazing horror vampire tale! I really enjoyed it!! The Director James Baack is a very talented guy who makes great amazing flicks Im really impressed with a lot of his work he does. Great stuff!! All his films so far are worth seeing I really like each and every one of them! This movie that Im reviewing is called Draculas Orgy Of The Damned. This chilling horror tale is about a young beautiful woman named Patricia who visits a psychiatrist for help because she witnessed her family savagely brutally murdered by the bloodthirsty king of vampires - Count Dracula and when Patricia turns into a vampire herself by Dracula, she sets on a path of revenge to destroy him back to Hell, and save her own soul from which point on her journey takes her onto a wicked land, where reigns of black magic, dark history, ghouls, werewolves. and devilry in the town of Crooked Hollow are about to take its place!

Very cool movie it reminded me of like an old 80s or 70s Grindhouse style vampire horror film and its unique in its own way like a new vampire film thats new been done before. If you like indie cheesy horror films with vampires, werewolves, cults, ghouls, exorcisms and plenty of more you like this film! Please check it out and buy your copy today and give James Baack the Director all your support and check out his other films as well!!

As you all know when I discover a film that is universally hated on, I do my best to find something redeemable in it, some saving grace, something to love about it, and most of the time I succeed. But sometimes Its irredeemable..This has to be the first time when I both loved and hated a film in equal amounts!

DRACULA'S ORGY OF THE DAMNED OF THE DAMNED starts off telling the tale of a young woman who visits a psychiatrist for help with her recent forced vampirism. You see, the woman was attacked by Dracula and forcefully turned into a vampire after being forced to watch the dark prince slaughter her family. The Psychiatrist calls an exorcist to rid her of the demon and then the young woman goes on a quest for revengeat which point the film deteriorates into nonsense.

This was one of those films where I actually enjoyed the majority and then it just went south out of nowhere.

Throughout the beginning of the film we had a delightfully dour narrator who frequently lost his fake English accent and actually managed to keep a straight face while telling this ludicrous tale.

Dracula looked less like the debonair soul seducer weve grown accustomed to and more like a rejected member of that horrible 90s band Orgy with a touch of Boy George. He dresses in a cheap pleather shirt thats clearly too small for him, sports a bald head and dribbles what Im assuming is meant to be blood but looks allot more like cough syrup. The only place this guy could seduce anyone is at a gay bondage club with very unchoosy patrons.

The woman goes toe to toe with Draculas goons in a machine gun battle which was nothing short of hysterical, especially considering that the actress clearly had trouble even lifting the thing let alone firing it!

The special effects on display here was likewise hilariously inept resembling what we saw in the old Hercules tv show.

The actingWhat acting!? It really seemed as if these people were told to act emotional in mundane scenes and completely wooden during emotional scenes. This had to be some of the worst acting I have ever seen! Its a rare occurrence when Shawn C. Philips puts in the best performance in a film but Ill be damned if he didnt!

The story was all of the place and largely built up of complete nonsense, my favorite scene being a random fight club scene where women bumped into each other (while one of them wore an alien mask) and men cheered before our leading female showed up and just opened fire on them with round after round of machine gun blasts while screaming about how they were sick bastards, and all the bodies disappeared without explanation.

This film has absolutely nothing in common with the Hammer House type horror it tries to homage. Hammer was artsy, this was raw and obviously homemade, Hammer was dramatic, this was anticlimactic and silly, Hammer was sexy, this wasnot. If anything Id say this came across a lot more like a parody of Hammer films then a homage.

I was full on in love with this film, I really was..and then it happened.

SPOILER ALERT

After the woman kills Dracula, rather then end the film on a great, and amazingly silly note, they instead veered off into a side story that wrecked the whole picture.

Instead of being quirky and bad, the acting (other then Shawns acting) became mean spirited, and downright vulgar

Theres not even an attempt at story in the second part of the film, which simply showcases a duo of girls on vacation in Europe (which looks exactly like upstate ny) Who then wind up staying with two of the least funny, most offensive racial stereotypes Ive ever seen outside of a Tyler Perry Movie. They then run through a house after being led there by a guy in a skull mask (which they have no problem with) wiggle flashlights around and then run and scream in a Blair Witch fashion before the credits roll.. They did nothing whatsoever with the subplot of Shawn being bitten by a werewolf (there is a werewolf in the movie, but its obviously not him and what a shame..just picture a 400 pound werewolfthat would have been excellent!) and it really seemed like they had the film done and then realized how short it was and quickly filmed the final scenes as filler, and it was one of the dumbest possible moves they could have made!

I give this film one middle finger up, The first half is laugh out loud funny in an unintentional way and I would highly recommend checking it out with a bunch of buddies and even more brewskies..but after Dracula dies turn it off unless you want the entire experience ruined for you.
