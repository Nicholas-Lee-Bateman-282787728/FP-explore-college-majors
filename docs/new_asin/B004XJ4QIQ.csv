4495797,5,B004XJ4QIQ,I love Mischievous Kiss!  Kim Hyun Joong is just unbelievably handsome and talented.  I recommend this to everyone who wants to feel in love again. :),1322697600,,150,4.730769230769231
4495798,5,B004XJ4QIQ,"This was my first introduction to K-Dramas and now I am hooked! This story was so sweet and fun it immediately made me want to go out and find more like it. Unlike other K-Dramas that take at least 1-2 episodes to get into, Mischievous Kiss had me from the very start. Happy endings for everyone!",1321228800,,296,4.303571428571429
4495799,5,B004XJ4QIQ,This show will make you laugh and smile throughout. Watched the entire show on Netflix and loved it so much that I wanted to buy and keep the memory. If you like K-Dramas like Rooftop Alley Cat then this is for you.,1315267200,2,215,4.142857142857143
4495800,5,B004XJ4QIQ,This series is placed in an alternate reality where the most popular kids at school are the smartest. The teddy bear endings were so darn cute. The subtitles were a little questionable with letters crossed out instead of erased and some of the translation needs further interpretation like instead of telling her to do nothing she should be still? But the actors are so animated you almost don't even need the subtitles. These Koreans can really act! Episode one was a little out there but everyone was hooked by episode two. Each episode was a little long (1hour),1313625600,,564,4.76530612244898
4495801,5,B004XJ4QIQ,"""Playful Kiss"" is a Korean adaptation of the Japanese manga and drama, ""Itazura na Kiss"", and the Taiwanese drama, ""It Started With a Kiss"" and ""They Kiss Again"". It is a story of a not so smart girl, Oh Ha Ni (Jung So Min), - who falls in love with genius, Baek Seung Jo (Kim Hyun Joong).

This drama is totally hilarious and is very addicting. The story is fun and entertaining. It is hard to stop watching it. I think I've seen this drama for more than 5 times and I plan to watch it more. At first, I just watched this drama just to see if this adaptation is better than the Taiwanese one, but as I watch it, I start to love the characters and even the actors. Kim Hyun Joong did a very good job in playing their role. You will feel their pain - especially Oh Ha Ni's. They had a perfect chemistry. I was so addicted that I own two copies of this drama.

Btw, this is the drama where I start to like and became addicted to Kim Hyun Joong.",1307577600,18,942,4.032085561497326
4495802,5,B004XJ4QIQ,"It's a pretty cute series, and at times unpredictable and weird. I really enjoyed the show because it wasn't the typical girl likes guy then she doesn't but then the guy likes her back. It was kinda unpredictable because the writers made Baek Seung Jo personality unreadable. One minuet he likes her but the next time he doesn't. It's a series worth checking out.",1307491200,3,363,4.6875
4495803,5,B004XJ4QIQ,"This Show IS Amazing and Hilarious. Half Of The First Episode Is Slightly Boring but It Picks Up Pace As The Plotline Continues. I Absoulutly Love IT Ive Watched All The Episode Including 7 Specials On Youtube And Hulu. For Those Who Wish To Understand More Of The Main Male Lead Thoughts Their IS Aslo His Diary Entreys Wich Are So Not Like His Character Called ""Baek Seung Jo's Diary"". Anywho I Reccomend It... Even After I Already Watched The Whole Series I Cant Get Enough So I Decided To Buy It Instead. XD YAY!!!!",1306713600,,519,4.473684210526316
4495804,5,B004XJ4QIQ,Another cute and funny Korean Drama. If you loved Boys Over Flowers then you will not be disappointed with this one. Typical high school story of a girl crushing on the untouchable Goldenboy in school and goes through hell back with all the ridicule and teasing and meanness. But of course he's a sweetheart deep down. Can't wait to own it!,1304899200,5,340,4.590163934426229

Oh Hani has a crush on Sueng-jo and finally tells him in a letter, but is rejected in a unique and embarrassing way. In front of their classmates, he returns the letter to her. She opens it up only to find spelling and grammar corrections and a grade. Oh Hani is heartbroken.

After her horrible rejection, an earthquake destroys her house. Her father's long lost friend invites him and Oh Hani to stay with his family. They accept the invitation gladly. But it just so happens that her father's friend is Sueng-jo's dad. Living with Sueng-jo has it's ups and downs.

She tries everything she can think of to gain his affection. And winning his heart is definitely not easy, especially when a beautiful, standoffish acquaintance of Sueng-jo's shows up to steal him away. Will she ever get him to fall for her?

Playful Kiss is based on the Japanese manga, ""Mischievous Kiss."" This drama was also made for Japanese and Taiwanese audiences and were a big success.

I liked the main actor in this show (He was in ""Boys Before Flowers."") so I gave it a try. I'm so glad I watched it! It's funny, sweet, and playful. There are so many funny and charming characters. There are many laugh-out-loud moments, as well as touching and romantic moments too. It's one of the best Korean romantic comedies. I recommend this drama. It's a show I can watch over and over.

8446980,3,B004XJ4QIQ,"I loved this drama when I viewed it online and was delighted to find it here and with English subtitles. Alas, the person doing the subs should give employer a refund for the work done on this video collection. The translation is worse than that you would get from Google or Bing...most of it reads as if Yoda was speaking.

""You friends noodles cold""  I will continue my search for a better copy of this show!",1361318400,,410,4.381578947368421

8446982,3,B004XJ4QIQ,"I love the idea of this story, I love the cute characters and eye candy aplenty in this Korean puppy love story. However I have to say I did not like the ending at all. I also did not like the message or overall theme to this k drama.

(Spoiler)

(Spoiler)

Basically have no self esteem,hang on to a guy even if he treats you like dirt and do nothing for yourself in life but follow him around and make yourself bothersome.

Not a good show for a teen to watch but there are some funny parts in it that made me chuckle.",1352160000,,535,4.057142857142857
8446983,3,B004XJ4QIQ,"Based on the popular Japanese comic Itazura na Kiss is an adorable Korean TV drama series that follows in the footsteps of hits like Boys Over Flowers.  Spunky high school student Hani isn't the sharpest tool in the shed.  In fact, she is in the worst class at her school (the vice principal refers to her class as cancer cells bringing them down).  However, thou she lacks brains; she is true to her heart.  Her problem is that she is head over heels in love with her school's top student, the handsome genius Seungjo (played by cutie Kim Hyun Joong from Boys Over Flowers and boyband SS501). Hani finally gathers up the courage to confess her love in a love letter to Seungjo, but he coldly rejects her and embarrasses her in front of the whole school.  He even goes as far as editing the love letter and grading it with a D minus.  And if that wasn't enough, a string of unfortunate events forces Hani and her father to move in with her father's old childhood friend - who is none other than Seungjo's father! Hani does what she can to win her dream boy over and break through his cold shell.  I didn't love this drama but I did like it.  What was hard for me is that Hani is so weak.  She constantly stalks Seungio to the point where you want to yell at her yourself.  Maybe it's because I've seen K-Dramas were the girls always stood up for themselves and fought back (like Jandi in Boys Over Flowers and Eun-sung from Brilliant Legacy) that made this one a little hard to truly enjoy.  I wanted Hani to stop obsessing over Seungio and make him want her but he is the constant center of her universe throughout the series. I did like the guy who played the Korean Elvis type.  He was hilarious.  And you will ADORE Seungio's mother.  She is so sweet to Hani and tries desperately to get the two together.  I loved how devoted she was to Hani.  And I LOVED Kim Hyun Joong.  He played the cold, arrogant, genius Seungio perfectly.  It's a fun drama to watch but don't expect it to thrill you like other K-Dramas.

This review is for the YA Entertainment Studio Version of the Korean Series Mischievous Kiss.  Subtitles are excellent (easy to read, few grammar errors).  Picture quality is amazing.",1341878400,2,2200,4.422885572139304
8446984,3,B004XJ4QIQ,I like the series but I wasn't satisfied. First the hair color of Hyun Joong does not look good on him. The character didn't match HIM. He seemed strange and it didn't feel right. I preffered him in Boys Over Flowers. The drama does stick to the manga with a few twists but it is ok. Not worth the money but worth the few laughs.,1341792000,,329,4.076923076923077
8446985,5,B004XJ4QIQ,"Cutely written script. The actors are able to pull you into the story line, causing you to cry with Oh Ha Ni when she's sad, yet can still share Baek Seung Jo's feelings of being annoyed at some of the things that she does too.

Kim Hyun Joong will mesmerize you with his talents as well as his attractiveness in anything that he is in! He was captivating in Boys Over Flowers. The more experience that Hyun Joong gains, the greater his talent becomes.",1337472000,,452,4.380952380952381
8446986,5,B004XJ4QIQ,"After watching several K-dramas, this is still in my top 3. I really love Kim Hyun Joong in this, and the female lead is cute and not annoying like some. It's a drawn-out love story, but well worth the wait. Great music and cute bears at the end of each episode add to its charm!",1335139200,,279,4.090909090909091
8446987,4,B004XJ4QIQ,"When i first heard about this drama i wasn't sure it was going to be any good but once i started it i fell in love! it is amazing!! the acting and story line is great. The box i got was also in very good condition, i highly recommend this",1327881600,,238,3.78
8446988,5,B004XJ4QIQ,"Note: This is a review for the drama and not this DVD set.

This show for me, just sort of bottles the giddiness of a first love.

Oh Ha Ni has gone to high school for the last four years with her pretty but super brilliant crush, Baek Seun Jo. To to a freak earthquake she had her father end up moving into Seung Jo's house (both fathers are old friends, who only have rediscovered each other).  Unfortunately for Ha Ni this happens right after she has given Seung Jo a letter of confession which leads to public humiliation on her part (the boy grades it and it ends up  being read out loud by a mean girl who also finds Seung Jo attractive).  It is very clearly a case of opposites attracting. Oh Ha Ni is bubbly, optimistic and very friendly--also the worst student in the school.  Seung Jo is emotionally stunted, distant and good at everything he does (except for human interaction--his mother, thru the entire series is saying what a bad personality he has).

Of course, their having to live together allows both of them to see the other in a different light. Ha Ni's nickname is 'Noah's Snail' because while she can't do anything really well, if she sticks to something long enough she will eventually succeed.  Seung Jo is able to admire her determination, it is something he has never had to do, he never has to try for anything.  At the same time Ha Ni begins to understand why Seung Jo has such an emotional wall built up and slowly works her charm on him, like the snail that she is.

It is a bubbly and frothy drama, pretty light on the intense emotional stakes. Oh Ha Ni is so adorable, and watching Seung Jo's icey self melt into someone who cares for her is really fun to watch.  This is one of the few dramas so far that I have gone back to again again. It has so many great scenes.  It also has by far, one of the best supporting cast of characters I have seen.  Bong Joon Gu is a great second lead male character, like most of the characters he is painted with really broad, comedic strokes at first and as the drama continues more subtle details about his character are layered on. Seung Jo's mom steals the show in every scene that she is in. (This probably has the best set of parents in any K-Drama I have seen, too.  They actively take interest in their children's lives and are always trying to do what is best for the kids, not themselves. You can really feel their concern and love.)

So plot isn't the strongest point in this drama, I'm okay with this. The characters are so adorable and they all have pretty well thought out arcs that make sense and are very consistently portrayed. I started watching this drama because of how much I loved Kim Hyun Joong as Ji Hoo in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boys-Over-Flowers-Korean-Drama-Complete-Set-8-DVDs-with-English-Subtitles/dp/B002D11UIA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boys Over Flowers - Korean Drama Complete Set (8 DVDs with English Subtitles)</a>.  He didn't really disappoint me in this. I can see his growth as an actor between one and the next (I also think the writing and character direction were a bit stronger in this show, so that helped).  Both characters are quieter than most around them, so there is an acceptable degree of stoicism which also allows him to be a great foil for the emotive characters he shares scenes with.

I also love how each episode ends with a little teddy bear reenactment of a pivotal scene from that episode (a la&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Palace/dp/B000XPRMD0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Palace</a>&nbsp;).

Just writing this review makes me want to go back and rewatch my favorite scenes.",1324598400,2,3699,4.8428571428571425
