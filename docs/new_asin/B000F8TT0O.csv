8119130,5,B000F8TT0O,Most young people would not appreciate Lawrence Welk because he is older. This was a great find for me because I use to watch it with my grandma at Christmas. I was extremely please with the seller and she even included a cd which I love. I would buy any other product from her I was very impressed.,1360540800,,299,4.172413793103448
8119131,4,B000F8TT0O,"I saw this when it first aired on PBS and enjoyed it very much.  There are eight former performers acting as hosts, including the late Myron Floren, and it consists of clips taken from Christmas shows from the series' nearly thirty year run.  It includes many clips of the children of former band members performing on the show, and although the picture quality is not of the best (probably due to age), it is just as good as the later program A Lawrence Welk Family Christmas, and unlike most PBS specials, Welk or otherwise, this one is two hours long, rather than the standard 85 or 90 minutes.  The only gripe I have, other than the picture quality, is that it is not on DVD.  I recommend this tape to Welk fans and all who enjoy clean family holiday entertainment.",1185840000,3,769,4.4714285714285715
