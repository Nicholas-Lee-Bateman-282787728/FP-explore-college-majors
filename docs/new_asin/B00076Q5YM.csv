2201509,3,B00076Q5YM,"The title is a misnomer, as the ladies in question are not always leading, but in decidedly subsidiary rles.  The films themselves are mostly mediocre, and the picture quality leaves something to be desired, but the under $10 price is very inexpensive, making this a pretty good deal if you're interested in at least two of the titles.

Here are the films, with the IMDB ratings:

Affair in Monte Carlo (1952) - 90 Minutes, 5.1/10
A writer (Leo Genn) tells a crowd in a caf about a woman (Merle Oberon) who once felt deeply in love with a compulsive gambler (Richard Todd).
Though this movie was filmed in Technicolor and is listed as 90 minutes, it appears that the copy included on this DVD was made from B&W television.  The picture quality is poor and there are numerous cuts that seem like commercial breaks, so that the total running time on the DVD is only 63 minutes -- about 1/3 of the film is missing!  This movie isn't that great anyway, so maybe that's a blessing.

The Deadly Companions (1961) - 93 Minutes, 6.2/10
Ex-army officer Brian Keith accidentally kills Maureen O'Hara's son, then escorts the funeral procession through Indian territory.

Dishonored Lady (1947) - 85 Minutes, 6.3/10
Madeleine (Hedy Lamarr) is the fashion editor of a slick Manhattan magazine by day and a lively party girl by night.

The Groom Wore Spurs (1951) - 80 Minutes, 5.6/10
Lawyer Ginger Rogers is hired to keep dumb cowboy Jack Carson out of trouble.

Home Town Story (1951) - 61 Minutes, 4.9/10
Blake Washburn (Jeffrey Lynn) blames manufacturer MacFarland (Donald Crisp) for his defeat in the race for re-election.
This movie is completely preposterous and seems long, even at just 61 minutes.

Jane Eyre (1934) - 62 Minutes, 4.6/10
A meek governess (Virginia Bruce) and her mysterious employer (Colin Clive) strike up a romantic relationship.

Katherine (1975) - TV Movie - 97 Minutes, 6.5/10
A harrowing look at the 60s thru the eyes of Katherine Alman (Sissy Spacek), a wealthy debutante who spirals down into a fight for the causes that shook a nation.

Der Skipper (Kill Cruise) (1990) - 98 Minutes, 4.9/10
Adventure / Drama / Thriller  (West Germany)
A washed-out German sailor (Jrgen Prochnow) agrees to take two British women (Patsy Kensit, Elizabeth Hurley) from Gibraltar to the W. Indies in his sail boat.

The Last Time I Saw Paris (1954) - 116 Minutes, 6.1/10
Charles returns to Paris to reminisce about the life he led in Paris after it was liberated.  With Elizabeth Taylor, Van Johnson, Walter Pidgeon, and Donna Reed.

Maybe I'll Come Home in the Spring (1971) - TV Movie - 74 Minutes, 6.6/10
Dennie (Sally Field) has returned from a year among the hippies to her superficial, image-conscious suburban family.

Killing Blue (Midnight Cop) (1988) - 95 Minutes (West Germany) - 4.4/10
Police Commissioner Alex Glass has been twisted into a sarcastic cynic by the hard luck story that is his life.  With Armin Mueller-Stahl, Morgan Fairchild, and Frank Stallone

Mutiny (1952) - 77 Minutes, 5.1/10
Early in the War of 1812, Captain James Marshall is commissioned to run the British blockade.  With Mark Stevens, Angela Lansbury, and Patric Knowles.

Never Wave at a WAC (1953) - 87 Minutes, 6.1/10
A divorced socialite (Rosalind Russell) joins the Army hoping it will help her to see more of her boyfriend, a Colonel.

Power, Passion, and Murder (1983) - 83 Minutes
Cannot be found at IMDB because this isn't a movie at all, but a consolidation of two 56-minute episodes from the PBS series, ""Tales from the Hollywood Hills.""

Road to Bali (1952) - 91 Minutes, 6.6/10
Bob Hope and Bing Crosby flee Melbourne to avoid various marriage proposals, then sign on as divers.

Death Game (The Seducers) (1977) - 91 Minutes, 4.7/10
A businessman picks up 2 young girls (Sondra Locke and Colleen Camp) and takes them home, where they seduce him, tie him up, and torture him.

The Snows of Kilimanjaro (1952) - 114 Minutes, 6.2/10
Writer Harry Street (Gregory Peck) reflects on his life as he lies dying from an infection while on safari.

Till the Clouds Roll By (1946) - 132 Minutes, 6.4/10
Light bio-picture / musical about Broadway pioneer Jerome Kern (Robert Walker).

Tulsa (1949) - 90 Minutes, 6/10
At the start of the oil boom Cherokee Lansing's rancher father is killed in a fight with the Tanner Oil Co.  With Susan Hayward, Robert Preston, and Pedro Armendriz.",1378684800,8,4374,4.83489932885906
2201510,2,B00076Q5YM,The label writes that the version of Jane Eyre in the set is the '34 version with Virigina Bruce but it is NOT. It is a very badly transfered copy of the '71 version of Jane Eyre with Susannah York. I have the VHS version and this version is all chopped up. hard to even follow the story. Only thing good about it is the musical score by John Williams!!! Very disappointed in the movies!!!,1367625600,8,389,4.2
2201511,3,B00076Q5YM,"We bought this collection December, 2012. We watched all 20 movies. Overall I give only an AVERAGE grade to this group of movies. On the back there are at least two mistakes: 1)Jane Eyre is NOT the 1934 version. It is the 1970 version with Susanah York and George C. Scott. 2) Kill Cruise is NOT about sailing to Bermuda as stated on the back but Barbados. The quality of the movies is OK at best. My recommendation is keeping looking.",1365033600,,435,4.382716049382716
