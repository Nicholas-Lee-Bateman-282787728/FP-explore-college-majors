8404277,5,B003SG30P0,"My Father and I watched this on our brand new RCA color TV when it was first shown back in 1952. I could not possibly remember how often I've watched it since.  Of course I was fortunate since my Father had served in World War II less than Ten years earlier.  I had a running commentary of my own from someone who had been there.

The show hasn't lost anything in years gone by.

I'd give it Ten Stars.",1360972800,2,402,4.050632911392405
8404278,5,B003SG30P0,"Watched this series as a child with my Dad...loved it then, love it now. I think every school should make this part of their History curriculum. Actual footage of events brings the reality of this war home. Historical names (Eisenhower, Churchill, MacArthur, Hitler, etc.) become real people again. It is not some Hollywood movie. By no means least, the musical score is absolutely awesome.",1310688000,3,390,5.109375
8404279,4,B003SG30P0,"I had purchased, and returned the Blueray version.  This is not only cheaper, but also does not have the annoying logos that the blueray version does, and seems to be made from a better print.  I would have given it five stars, but there is so much waisted packaging that I feel it should be dinged a little for being less than considerate of the environment.",1302134400,,359,4.424242424242424
8404280,2,B003SG30P0,"I received the dvd quickly,it was a christmas present for my husband. Unfortunately it is defective. The tape played at first but the second half no sound is coming out. I play dvd's all the time so its not my player. I would hope to get my money back or a new one mailed to me. Thanks, Gina",1294444800,,291,4.0344827586206895
