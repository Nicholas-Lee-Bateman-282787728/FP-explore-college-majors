4105529,4,B003BBI7GE,"So here's the lowdown on Airline Disaster, without ruining the end: it isn't a mockbuster, there's no specific film it's capitalizing on, it's just your basic terrorists-taking-over-a-super-plane-on-its-maiden
-voyage-in-exchange-for-the-release-of-their-terrorist-buddies movie, made atypical by a really neat end that'll get you smiling, guaranteed, and not because it's happy or anything, just when you figure out what they're doing, it makes you smile, slyly.

It's a good story overall, a nice balance of action and intrigue, well-paced and with a couple of hit points that make the plot more than one-note. Point: the super plane's pilot is the President's brother. Double Point: the President's a woman. Triple point: the President is played by Meredith Baxter-no-longer-Birney (the mom from ""Family Ties"") and the pilot is played by Scott Valentine (Mallory's boyfriend on ""Family Ties,"" also, Carnosaur 3). Weird! Rounding out the cast are some Asylum regulars like Geoff Meed (6 Guns, I Am Omega), Londale Theus (Transmorphers: Fall of Man, 2012: Supernova) and the lovely, talented and ridiculously underused Lindsey McKeon.

Without spoiling anything about the end, I'll just wrap this up by saying all in all, Airline Disaster is a captivating action-thriller on par with any other big-plane-gone-amok film (see Air Force One, Turbulence, Executive Decision, Die Hard 2) and with an ending that might just make you stand up and cheer, depending on how drunk you are. I was pretty drunk. There were tears.

Plus, you get to hear Scott Valentine bellow this line, in reference to his super plane: ""Come on, you big beautiful whale!""

Awesome.",1298937600,,1653,5.470588235294118
4105530,1,B003BBI7GE,"The plot is about as unoriginal as they come. It resembles one of the Die-Hard movies. However, the Diehard movies actually had decent acting, scripting, and directing. This movie goes down in the biggest fireball since the Hindenburg. It's actually worse than any made-for TV movie that I've seen. I would go so far to speculate that this movie was an experiment to see how cheaply and badly a movie could be made, but still make a profit from an unsuspecting audience.
If this movie had been scripted as a comedy like ""Airplane!"", it might have been entertaining. Some of the shots of the cabin pandemonium right before the crash look as if they were plucked directly from ""Airplane!"". They cut to the exact same shot perhaps a half dozen times, with the same idiotic fake screaming.
The CGI looks like it was done by high school kids - no exaggeration. The physics are incredibly bad. The airplane hits several structures without so much as a scratch on itself. Then, it hits the Washington monument and obliterates it - again, without so much as a scratch. Any upright walking descendant of an ape realizes that exactly the opposite would happen.
I'd guess that each scene was shot only once no matter how bad it was. The only decent acting among the main characters was from Lindsey McKeon in the scenes where she didn't talk. Those scenes saved her from the horrible writing/scripting.
The only way to see another film this bad is to go see Titanic II - which has the same writer.",1294531200,5,1486,4.653992395437262
4105531,3,B003BBI7GE,"The movie as a whole wasn't bad. It was suppose to be a suspenseful disaster flick and it was.  And While the minor characters were guilty of overacting, Meredith Baxter was refreshingly believable as the President. I had no idea she was that talented .Scott Valentine was quite good too, as was his co-pilot once the early dialogue was over. The special effects were truly lousy though. The worst being the last scene, but none were believable in this fx age. The high point, however, being Meredith Baxter as President. I wish it had been a ""headier"" movie for that character.",1291939200,5,578,4.7227722772277225
4105532,1,B003BBI7GE,"Briefly put, this ""film"" is a disaster, but not of the airline variety.  Acting is amateurish and over-the-top by one and all, special effects are pathetic throughout, and the movie's continuity supervisor was asleep at the switch (to put it mildly).  Witness:  25 minutes into the film, one of three Air Force interceptor planes is destroyed in mid-air, leaving only TWO in hot pursuit.  One minute later, (@ 26:00) there are THREE planes chasing the hijacked aircraft once again!  A few minutes more into the film . . . only TWO remain.  Truly pathetic, as is this entire effort.  Meredith, I have always loved your work.  PLEASE choose your projects more carefully in the future, OK?",1286064000,12,686,4.853448275862069
4105533,2,B003BBI7GE,Save the money...Mediocre performances and graphics...go watch AIR FORCE ONE...literally the same thing. Not worth $25 bucks.,1285459200,,125,6.411764705882353
4105534,3,B003BBI7GE,"Starring: Meredith Baxter,Scott Valentine and Lindsey McKeon.
Liked this movie,You think you gonna hate,then something kewl happens.
The poster looks foreign ,nay perhaps japanese in action-style of depiction ?
Meredith( Family Ties tv) Baxter plays the president and as secret service is securing location of her parents,And the fact that her brother,Scott Valentine(also Family Ties alumnae) is pilot of Airline Disaster,They tell her the FIRST LADY ? is safe,Seriously should have rewound and made sure,But,Meredith came out of closet this year and well...Bravo scriptwriter !
The effects are hit and miss,Thats harsh because THE PLANE itself was my only regret in look,All other explosions and such rocked.
Geoff Meed was another kewl villian and who the heck is Lindsey McKeon ( IMDB says she was on ONE TREE HILL,oh ) She steals the movie and comes out with some awesome stuff on screen .",1277164800,2,894,5.215277777777778
4105535,5,B003BBI7GE,I had never heard of this movie before but it came up in my search for a Christmas movie about Meredith Baxter.  I really like it.  The film had a good cast and keep me on the edge of my seat!  It was well worth the purchase.,1370995200,,225,3.74468085106383
4105536,5,B003BBI7GE,"I love this actor and when I saw a program on tv, I had to order some of her finest work.",1362787200,,89,3.2857142857142856
4105537,1,B003BBI7GE,"The only redeeming qualities about this movie are the tech advancements suggested for future aircraft.  I like the idea of an autopilot feature, and believe there are several advantages to a remote control for commuter flights.  I am not sure why counter-terrorism measures would accompany a passenger plane.  Teleconferencing with the cockpit is also a great idea.

The idea of an aircraft out of control falling in an urban area would make a great adrenaline pumping drama if it was executed better.  The action, complications, and conflicts all seem very unnatural.  I would not have a problem with the campy special effects if the plot were better.  Events seem to jump around, trying to answer for exceptions at the last minute.

Character development is also very weak.  Meredith Baxter is a good actor, but it is hard for her to shine with such a contrived plot, and poorly written script.  Lindsey McKeon is sexy and courageous in her portrayal of an overqualified babysitter for a VIP pilot.  I do not feel the same animosity toward the ""bad guys"" as I do toward the poor result of this film.  The good guys are not even well-developed despite the suggestion that complex relationships exist between the characters.  Londale Theus, lead investigator for the FBI, does a good job salvaging his shallow character too.

I do not place the blame for this on the cast; I think it is more of a script or budget problem.  According to IMDb, filming spanned only 12 days.  I don't know what the average is, but I believe more time is dedicated to filming an episode for a prime-time sitcom.  Producer and director could have also made greater efforts on this one.  It is clear to me that the budget was also limited.  I cannot find any record of how much was spent on making this film.

I am glad I rented this rather than bought it.  I also never saw it at the theater.  It would definitely have been more disappointing in that format because of the cost of an in-theater experience.",1340841600,,1985,4.676300578034682
4105538,1,B003BBI7GE,"Two rules of thumb for fans of sci-fi, horror, and disaster pics: one - never buy anything made by THE ASYLUM, and two - never by anything released by ALPHA VIDEO.  You may be tempted by some positive reviews, but remember - there are lots of shills and mental defectives out there.",1337817600,,282,4.423076923076923
4105539,1,B003BBI7GE,"Oh, where to start? As an active airline pilot, sometimes well-meaning friends will send me airplane movies for my entertainment. That is normally a bad thing, and I dislike the vast majority of airplane disaster films, but none more so than the appalling ""Airline Disaster."" This one is so bad that I won't even start on the technical and procedural impossibilities of the movie, other than to question if anyone involved with the making of this movie can tell the front end of a plane from the back. (OK, I guess at least the CGI people can....) The film opens with the hilarious looking ""Starquest"" fully automated airliner (think of a badly rendered child's concept of a 747 with scimitar shapes for wings and control surfaces) departing on its maiden voyage under the command of Captain Joe Franklin (""Family Ties"" alum Scott Valentine.) It has (of course) been infiltrated by bad guys and a couple of federal agents. On the ground there are bad guys kidnapping the Captain's family. Who could these evildoers be? Of course they are members of a PC-approved enemy (can you guess who?) known for so many crimes against aviation. (Not.)

The FBI and Secret Service gets involved, and the President immediately starts meeting with high level advisors in a claustrophobic conference room. Who's the President, you may ask? Well, it's yet another ""Family Ties"" veteran, Meredith Baxter as President Franklin, and sister of Captain Joe, of course. This President is the most hand-wringingly inept of the genre's Oval Office occupants. ""Family Ties"" actually had more genuine terror and suspense, and much more nuanced characters. Among problematic plot elements is Secret Service agent Gina Vitale (Lindsey McKeon) hiding out in a cargo hold, talking to the President on her cell phone, and figuring out how to prevent fuel dumping by looking in a huge box conveniently labeled ""avionics."" (Ponder. Now ponder some more.) There's also a brief subplot about flying Starquest by remote control that leads to some true scenery chewing and awful special effects. Meanwhile on the ground, Joe's wife and kids have an opportunity to escape their captors, but instead she elects to send her son to run for help while she and the daughter stay put. Brilliant. The net result is perpetuating the film for another hour, so don't get your hopes up too high.

After the terrorists shoot at the plane's wiring (surely a bright thing to do in a completely automated aircraft, no?) there is much hamology on display with some of the truly worst dialogue (airline pilots NEVER say things like ""I'm in control of this ship!"" or talk about port and starboard) and effects ever seen even in this wretched subgenre of suspense movies. (It's definitely not ""Airport"" or even ""Die Hard 2."") The Starquest proves its robust design by repeatedly running into things and knocking them over (e.g. antennae, the Washington Monument, etc.) It even dekrelnificates a church steeple. The chief villain Robert (Geoff Meed, whose mustache is the genuinely scariest thing in the movie) discovers a courier onboard with $150,000,000 in bonds that he wants to steal in a pointless subplot (yeah, because those will be easy to cash in after a murderous crime spree.) After more babble about how the plane has ""Flight Guard"" rendering the pursuing F-22s missiles unable to track (then take the gun shot...) the film deteriorates into what can be best described as a parody of itself when the giant space laser fails to shoot Starquest down, but does leave a swath of hilarious destruction in a downtown block. Much drama ensues in the closing few minutes, with some predictably heroic hand to hand combat, more truly ghastly special effects, and Captain Joe ranting on about how ""We've lost our GPS!...We're flying blind!...""The horizon indicator just went dead!"" So look out the window; it's day without a cloud in the sky and you're over Washington, DC...any real pilot could see three suitable airports from there. (Attention filmmakers: pilots still look outside. That's why we have windows.) Because of the proximity of three large airports (four if you count Baltimore) Joe does the only sensible thing and lands in the Potomac River. Why didn't he go all the way and taxi to the White House? I was very amused that after they landed in the river nobody makes any attempt to get off the sinking aircraft, yet somehow Joe gets to the bank of the river (and he's dry!) in time to hug his wife with the sinking Starquest in the background. (I give up.)

The DVD contains several extras including bloopers (more entertaining than the film, but just barely,) and a ""Making of"" feature which is heavy on interviews. Most are wholly unnoteworthy, however Scott Valentine has a few things to say that entertained me. He claims that ""It's make believe...it's what actors get paid to do."" He's definitely correct: it certainly is make believe, but I think most of these actors were vastly overcompensated (Meed turns in the least wooden performance.) He also deadpans that he ""wants to do justice"" to pilots. I cannot tell you how un-tributeworthy this movie is to the profession, Scott. But it's really not his fault; he just performed a part in a laughably uninformed, unrealistic, and downright bad movie, which is in every way implausible and terrible.

Instead of this, I recommend watching another airplane movie. Any other airplane movie.",1323561600,10,5403,4.966850828729282

4105541,4,B003BBI7GE,"I enjoyed this movie.  In fact I bought it.  It does exactly what it sets out to do, which is build suspense and entertain.  The acting and script are good, but not fantastic.  It has two actors from Family Ties, Meredith Baxter and Scott Valentine (Elise Keaton and Nick, her daughter Mallory's boyfriend) who are brother and sister in the film.  This alone would make it worth watching, but in accordance with present day revelations, Meredith Baxter is our female lesbian president with a first lady and children--if only America were that open-minded, right?  Gotta love it...just watch and enjoy this, it ain't supposed to be Citizen Kane.",1310083200,,644,4.916666666666667

4105543,2,B003BBI7GE,"Is this film worth your time?
No, not really.
Is this film worth buying?
If you can get it cheap. VERY cheap.
How is the acting?
Not very good at all. It is barely passable.
How is the character development?
There is virtually none. I didn't care whether or not the characters died or lived with the exception of the Air Force Pilots.
How are the special effects?
They are not good either.
How does this film stack up against other Ayslum films?
Well it is your typical Asylum film. I would say it is better than some but worse than some others.

Overall, if you can get it for 3 bucks or less I would say take a chance and see it. Just watch it with an open mind. I'm not going to give it one star because I knew what I was buying. Just be warned, this is not a great film by any means. If you want a good hijacker movie go see Delta Force with Chuck Norris.",1308355200,,859,4.023391812865497
4105544,5,B003BBI7GE,"This movie is a lot of fun to watch.  It is an old-fashioned airline hijacking story with a few twists thrown in. Some of the refreshing things in the movie:

(1) A female President is believable.  Meredith Baxter plays her well.  Madame President is tough, sensitive, and serious.
(2) Anyone speaking in a gunfight goes down in a fraction of a second.  Cold-blooded killers also shoot innocents without warning.  No flowery dialogue or cliched standoff-speeches are used here.
(3) Technology and modern solutions to problems go terribly wrong or fail.  Humans save the day.

Some problems:

(1) The minor characters remain minor and nothing more than plot points.  Hostages?  Passengers?  Who?  Even the jet becomes more of a character than the minor characters.  The major characters don't fare much better, but the in-movie time constraint limits character development.  The jet is running out of fuel, so the movie moves quickly.
(2) The special-effects scenes are a bit boring, with most of them being the jet flying.  Watching a passenger jet fly is not that exciting. The movie gave it a good try, and the flying-jet scenes were more engaging than some Asylum monster-fight scenes.
(3) The jet is indestructible and invincible.  If all passenger jets were built like that, then they could destroy entire countries.

Still, this movie is a fun ride from beginning to end.  Action, mayhem, some believable dialogue.  It's five stars in spite of being an Ayslum movie.",1301529600,,1472,5.029045643153527
