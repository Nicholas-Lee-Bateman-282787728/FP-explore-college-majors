I give it a 3-star not because of the performance itself but because of the camera work and editing. First of all, there are just too many close ups of the dancers faces and body parts. Ballet and dance for that matter is all body language esp the feet instead of expressions. Although the dancers acting was great but shooting at a hand, a shoulder or a feet does not help the viewer understand the meaning of the movement or of the interaction of the dancers. This is particularly bad when there is a group of dancers. It almost ruined the final interaction of the six dancers scene. Then there is the viewing angle. It just changes too fast from one shot to another. I can understand the need to break monotony but this flashy techniques does give you the headaches and dizziness. So where is the enjoyment? It goes to show camera work or editing can ruin a great work. Perhaps the plus side is that it does make me want to go to the theatre and see the work again up close!",1412121600,4,1095,4.45273631840796
8354587,5,B0027DQH8M,"The costumes, dancing and the music are interesting. This is a ballet I will watch again.
The ballet is presented in an overture: Sinfonia; a prologue: Caravaggio solo and The Light; a first act: The streets of Milan and Journey to Rome, followed by the Roman Carnival: Bacchus' procession, The fortune teller, The tooth extraction, Young Musicians, The Cardsharps, Dispute and duel and First finale. The final section is The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew.",1369699200,2,453,5.135135135135135
8354588,5,B0027DQH8M,"In my book this ballet is an outstanding success although the premiere December 2008 met a mixed response (The critique is on the net [...]) IMO this is modern ballet at its best and is danced to very appealing arrangements of Montererdi's centuries old music. I consider it to be far better than AMELIA. The artistry, athleticism and interpretation of the dancers is impressive. They express a series of emotions with extremely effective lighting. There is no story as such, just dance interpreting the music supposedly giving a portrait of the painter, but it might not appeal to everyone.
The video is first rate but the audio had me perplexed as ARTHAUS production omitted the usual audio selection in the introductory menu. The audio can be toggled between PCM stereo and DTS-HD via the player remote but that should not be necessary.
I thoroughly enjoyed the brilliant artistry and like it more and more at each viewing but that is a very personal opinion so it is recommended with a caution as it might not be your cup of tea.",1245542400,12,1033,4.7444444444444445
