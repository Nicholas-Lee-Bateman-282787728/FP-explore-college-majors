You'll hear classic lines like ""I like the pole and the hole"", ""Why don't you come over to my crib and I'll make your pinky all stinky"", & my favorite ""Pee on me"".

1882993,5,B00009B8FW,"This show is, by far, the funniest thing on American TV in the past 20 years.  Its twisted sense of humor, and the excellent timing of the actors involved, make it a must-own for any Sedaris fan.  Broadcast on Comedy Central during their heyday (which has now, sadly, passed) this was a brilliant satire of typical after-school specials and morality plays.

1882995,5,B00009B8FW,"Why anyone would have ignored this cult classic is beyond me.  This hi-LAR-ious show about a 46-year-old high school freshman turned away some because of the unsightly overbite of its star, Jerri Blank (Amy Sedaris).  Perhaps it was her affinity for drugs and bisexuality.  Or yet perhaps it was her shapely body.  However, for those of us who are rabid (dogs) fans, it was a godsend from Comedy Central that, like JESUS or Aaliyah, was taken away far too soon.",1054080000,7,461,4.725

1883002,2,B00009B8FW,"Don't you hate it when good friends whose taste is typically congruent with your own recommend something you find awful? Can you see where this review is going? I like Amy Sedaris but her over-the-top facial tics, while no doubt intended to provide the substance of her character, are hard to watch after the first 30 seconds but her mugging continues unabated for the duration. Exposition comes in a cursory voiceover which substitutes for any deeper character development. There are some nice touches (the sound design for the drug trips is spot on) but in general this is just simpleminded and meanspirited. If you liked A Fish Called Wanda you might like this, but that's a movie I walked out on and I would've done the same with this except I was already home and in bed, lamenting time and money wasted.

This is the old ABC Afterschool Special turned on it's head.  She is in her 40's, after a stint in prison, and back in high school.  Her teachers include Stephen Colbert and Paul Dinello, both of whom are brilliant here.  As she says in the opening, ""I was a user, a boozer, and a loser"".  What she is is hilarious.

Given that, it's one of the funniest shows ever because, like all sketch comedy, it goes too far, but it's satiric aim is dead on.  The only reason this series didn't take off is that it's dramatic effect is so arcane that many who see it for the first time will  be shocked, or disgusted by what they see and not watch it again. Well, even those who like the show are sometimes shocked and disgusted, but the show more than makes up for it by being absolutely hysterical and featuring performers who can improvise on a dime and have wits like razors.

If the style of humour in shows such as South Park and Family Guy appeals to you, chances are you'll probably enjoy this one.  If you don't end up loving it you'll at least appreciate the satire, characterization and randomness all in impeccable timing.  One episode alone contains enough original and biting material to stay in your head for weeks.

1883102,5,B00009B8FW,"Amy Sedaris, Paul Dinello, Stephen Colbert and Gregory Hollimon all shine in ""Strangers With Candy,"" a sublime spoof of those ABC ""After School Specials"" we grew up with in the late 1970s and early 80s. ""Strangers With Candy"" is based upon the unlikely premise of 46 year-old ex junkie whore Jerri Blank turning around her life by returning as a high school freshman after 32 years on the wild side. Each week brings some new ""crisis,"" which involves fitting in vs. conforming, trying drugs and alcohol, teenage sexual experimentation, retardation and special ed, etc. Naturally, half-wit Jerri always makes the wrong choice.

""Strangers With Candy"" was Comedy Central's most clever and politically incorrect show (even moreso than ""South Park""). Along with Jerri are her alcoholic stepmother (prudishly played by Deborah Rush), a classmate of indeterminate ethnicity (""Orlando,"" played by Orlando Pabotoy) who Jerri uses for the butt of her racist jokes, and the amazingly narcissistic faculty, headed by Principal Onyx Blackman (Greg Hollimon), the black principal with a penchant for ""fine white women."" Blackman has a thing for Jerri's stepmom, but it never pans out, because her stepmom is as big a racist as Jerri! Swishy art teacher Joffrey Jellineck (Paul Dinello) and uptight science teacher Chuck Knoblet (Stephen Colbert) confound students with their learned ignorance, and the pair carry on a secret gay affair in the boiler room.

But Sedaris really makes the show work for her over-the-top earnestness in playing Jerri. Sedaris wins the Chloris Leachman award for botching up her natural good looks with gaudy makeup, harelip overbite, twitching unibrow, wrinkled forehead and padded hips just to get totally into character. And like Lucille Ball, Sedaris will do anything for a laugh, but unlike Ball, we're talking NC-17 rated here!

It was a shame to watch it being given the boot in 2001 because of low ratings. For some reason, it never caught on. However, it is becoming evident that it was because ""Strangers With Candy"" was ahead of its time: All three seasons are now available on DVD, and a ""prequel"" movie (with ALL the original major cast members, including the cute-as-a-button Maria Thayer) is currently in post-production.

The best two episodes in this set are the pilot ""Who Wants Cake,"" in which Blackman and Knoblet make Jerri rat out her locker mate for being retarded (by the way, ""they all want cake"") and ""Feather in the Storm,"" in which Jerri becomes anorexic, in order to lose enough weight to make the debate squad (?!)

These writers were not thinking about how they could make the most money off of their show; they were interested in creating art for the sake of art. No wonder it only lasted for three seasons.

This is an after-school-teen-drama for grownups. At the end of each episode, Jerri learns a ""lesson"" about ""life"", but the morals are less than Aesop-ian! Be prepared to have pretty much every racial, religious and social demographic insulted at some point.
We admit it. This sure isn't for everybody. And you won't always ""laugh out loud"". The writing and acting are smart commentaries on life today. Issues such as alcoholism, single parenting, retardation, and eating disorders are hysterically given better treatment than you'll find anywhere else except possibly.....well, anywhere else!
Satire is a delicate form of humor and shows such as SNL and MadTV will occasionally hit the nail right on the head. Strangers With Candy, however, never misses a shot!",1064275200,,993,5.3312101910828025
1883124,5,B00009B8FW,"The first time I saw Strangers With Candy (""The Who Wants Cake"" episode) I laughed so hard I was gasping for breath, tearing, palpitating, and generally looking for stasis on my couch. The only other things that ever had that effect on me were Monty Python's Twit of the Year race and American Movie's Mike Shank ""reminding"" everyone to bring brown gloves. Other than that, it takes a lot to get me to respond so convulsively and SWC does that on a regular basis. As I'm sure many other reviewers have stated, this show is designed to be a corny after school special (retaining the weekly social issues and melodramatic incidental music); however with life lessons pretty much the opposite of what anyone in their right mind would advise to children. The main character, Jerri Blank, is a 46 year old high school freshman who fares better the second time around saying ""at least when she makes the wrong choices, she's making them for all of the right reasons."" She's subjected to, and in most cases participates in, the most over-the-top, un-politically correct onslaught ever to hit the stale, American sit-com formula. Blank, played by Amy Sedaris, is hilarious with her contorted, expressions shifting from worry to lust as she wanders the halls at fictional Flatpoint High, trying to fit in socially while avoiding ""the hassles.""  Costars Stephen Colbert and Paul Dinello are equally hilarious as social studies and art teachers respectively, dishing out advice like ""95% of debating is about physical appearance,"" ""if you're gonna smoke pot, be prepared to spend a lot of time sitting around laughing with your friends,"" and poems on Hiroshima should contain ""nothing too faggy."" Ok, that's all I'm giving up in the jokes department, but if you like humor that is deliberately outrageous, twisted, offensive to any group you could possibly belong to, and a perfect satire of the hypersensitive didacticism of the after school special, you should buy this immediately. As a fan like so many others on here, I'd say the more that are bought the better case we can make for them releasing seasons 2 and 3. Thank god we finally have a real reason to shout ""Jerri"" at the television.",1064188800,4,2184,4.886792452830188
1883125,5,B00009B8FW,"Alright, if you are the sensitive type and dark, politically incorrect humor bothers you, do not watch Strangers with Candy. The reason this show is so hilarious comes straight out of its very un-PC humor. It makes fun of minorities, homosexuals, the mentally handicapped, violent students... practically anything out there to be poked at gets at least one joke.
Personally, I don't find the show offensive at all because I go into it understanding that everything that happens merely exists to be funny, not to offend. The creators play off of society's fear that we have to constantly walk on eggshells, or we run the risk of offending everyone. This way of thinking, while somewhat justified, does become a bit ridiculous though. With this show, they say hey, what is everyone so afraid of? Instead of running from insane stereotypes, why not laugh at them? The stereotypes then get addressed and are proven to be just what they are: ridiculous.
That said, there might not be a more obscure character than Jerri Blank. A 46 year old freshman at Flatpoint High (home of the Concrete Donkeys), and a self-proclaimed 32 year old teenage runaway. Half the time she's girl-crazy, the other half boy-crazy. She's popular one day and a complete loser the next. The inconsistencies in the show really give it charm though. Of course the show is completely over the top but truthfully, some people really are this crazy. Strangers with Candy is an after-school special gone very, very wrong (and the creators actually formatted the show to seem just like an after-school special, making it even more hilarious).
I really love the episode ""Who Wants Cake?"" in which Jerri is forced to narc on her locker mate about whether or not Kimberly is retarded. The concept is absurd and the character Kimberly is obviously not ""retarded"". However, the show plays off the horrible misconceptions so intelligently that I couldn't even stop myself from laughing if I tried. Great quote (may not be exact words, but you get the idea): ""You might be screaming no no no, but all they hear is who wants cake. And they all do. They all want cake.""
Dark humor at it finest. The real tragedy is the show was only on for three seasons and as of now, this is the only season released on DVD.",1063324800,4,2263,4.760814249363868

SWC is impossible to do justice to in a review, but I like a challenge. The basis of the program is a very dark take on ""after-school"" TV specials, the ones that teach you a valuable lesson about being nice to people and doing the chores, that sort of thing. This idea mutates into some very blackly comic situations as Jerri Blank (the anti-hero who remains strangely sympathetic despite being completely devoid of morals and quite replulsive really) learns a lesson, albeit the wrong lesson usually, each week about topics such as buying friends with drugs, parenthood, racism and more. It's hilarious (sorry ""hil-LAR-ious), throroughly quotable and something that will probably be discovered in 15 years time for the incredible work that it is.

1883131,5,B00009B8FW,"Where do I begin with this show?  First off, SWC is perhaps one of the most bitingly funny TV shows that Comedy Central ever aired.  It's right up there with other great shows such as Mr. Show, MTV's The State and Mystery Science Theater 3000.  Although the series didn't last any longer than three seasons, it has become a big cult hit regardless.
One of the reasons I enjoy this show so much is for its well-written, extremely clever characters.  Whether it be the secretly gay lovers Noblet and Jellineck, or the ""dictator"" principal Onyx Blackman, to Jerri's stereotypical jerk brother Derrick and her delightfully wicked stepmother Sara, to the lead character Jerri Blank herself, there is a ton of depth that make all these characters shine.
The episodes themselves are skewered parodies of ""Afterschool Specials"" except that Jerri always does the wrong thing in the end, yet it all works out.  This DVD collects every episode from the first season.  One thing to be said about SWC is that season by season, it is consistently good and funny.  There are quite a few good episodes from Season one including ""Feather in the Storm"", ""To Be Young, Gifted, and Blank"", and ""A Burden's Burden"", among others.  Also included is the original pilot for the series that (thankfully) never aired.  Although future episodes borrowed heavily from this pilot, the episode itself is pretty rough and obviously a big overhaul was needed.
Also included on the DVD is commentary for three episodes.  I must admit it is quite disappointing that there isn't any commentary for the rest of the season but hopefully that will be corrected if any of the future seasons are put out on DVD.
I must say I truly enjoy this show and think this DVD is well worth the purchase.",1060214400,,1753,4.774834437086093

1883147,5,B00009B8FW,"I really loved ""Strangers with Candy"" and was sad when it was cancelled prematurely.  The series ran for 30 some episodes, and the first 10 episodes (season 1) are included on this 2 DVD set.  ""Strangers"" stars Amy Sedaris (sister of auther David Sedaris), Steven Colbert (seen on the ""Daily Show""), and Paul Dinello.  These three worked together for years (e.g., ""Exit 57"") before creating this series.
Amy Sedaris plays Jerri Blank, a 46-year-old loser who returns to high school after being a teenaged runaway for 32 years.  Her father is immobile, and her step-mother and half-brother hate her.  The series is patterned after an after-school episode, and each one ends in Jerri learning a ""lesson"" (as well as participating in funky dance sequences!).  The humor is sometimes bizzare, often raunchy, and always politically incorrect!
Episode 1: Old Habits, New Beginnings.  Jerri tries to fit in by mixing up some drugs (glint) for a popular cheerleader (Poppy), with tragic results.  Jerri loses the first in a long series of pets and does her first ""I got something to say!"" bit.
Episode 2: A Burden's Burden.  Jerri is given a 10-pound baby (whom she dubs ""Dizzy"") by her health teacher.  She fails miserably and is paired up with Tammi Littlenut to complete the assignment.  Teacher Noblet and Jellineck begin their unusual ""relationship.""  This episode is hilarious and presents a new, more demented side of Jerri.
Episode 3: Dreams on the Rocks.  Jerri get a leading role in the school production of ""A Raisin in the Sun,"" beating out several African-American students!  This acting success leads Jerri's step-mother on a ""hilarious"" alcolohic bender.
Episode 4: Who wants cake?  Jerri is asked to determine whether her lockermate, Kimberly, is ""[mentally challenged].""  If she doesn't cooperate, she'll miss the school trip to Good Time Island.
Episode 5: Bogie Nights.  Jerri falls for the new kid in school (Ricky, played by Chip from ""Kate & Ally""), much to the consternation of her fellow students.
Episode 6: Jerri Is Only Skin Deep.  Jerri runs for Homecoming Queen.  She tries to increase her ""inner beauty"" by doing volunteer work, with tragic results for a chicken.
Episode 7: Let Freedom Ring.  Jerri is suspected of writing a racial slur on a school wall, and she tries to seduce a student who supposedly witnessed the event.  Jerri famously asserts that she likes the ""pole and the hole.""
Episode 8: Feather in the Storm: Jerri wants to try out for the debate team, but everyone tells her that she's too fat, leading her to develop an eating disorder.
Episode 9: To Be Young, Gifted and Blank.  Mr. Noblet tries to turn Jerri into a violin prodigy, driving a wedge between himself and Mr. Jellineck.
Episode 10: The Trip Back.  Jerri becomes attracted to a young female stoner and begins doing pot.
Extras: Sedaris, Colbert, and Dinello do audio commentary for four episodes.  They are hilarious together, and the commentaries help shed some light on their bizarre senses of humor.
The original, unaired pilot is also included.  The plot is similar to the ""Who Wants Cake?"" episode, but there are quite a few differences.  Notably, Jerri has a volunteer job at a genertonology rehab center and Dinello and Colbert have dual roles.  The pilot is not as good as the later episodes, but it's interesting to see how the series evolved.",1058486400,120,3354,4.942857142857143

This is one of those shows that thrives on pushing the boundaries of bad taste all in the context of the afterschool special formula.
In addition to Sedaris' expert job at playing a hapless re-entry high school student, the job of Colbert and Delillo as two of her teachers is amazing.  Delillo especially is amazingly good at SOUNDING like a very concerned sensitive teacher while telling his students horrible demeaning comments.  The short snippets of Colbert's 'history' lessons are an amazing satire of how history is taught and are very much in the vein of his work on the Daily Show.

Strangers With Candy was an absolutely brilliant comedy that took the concept of After-School Specials and turned it on its head - then gave it a wedgie - and then gave it a swirlie.  A decidedly weird parody of this respected but stereotypical genre, one which never feared to go farther than most people could even conceive of in its inanity and bold disregard of political correctness necessarily plays to one of two extremes: either you hate the show and refuse to watch anything so ridiculous again in your life or you, like me, develop an obsessive fascination and love for it.  I'm frankly rather surprised to see this Season One DVD released, but my reaction to the news, alongside a mad rush to get it in my hands as soon as possible, was, to quote a favorite line from lead character Jerri Blank, ""Good times.  Good times.""
Jerri Blank (Amy Sedaris) is rather amazingly representative, in her own special way, of your typical high school student.  What makes this so amazing is the fact that she is a forty-six-year-old freshman.  After thirty-two years of drug abuse, prison time, and who knows what else, she has returned home to pick up where she left off when she ran away from home.  Flat Point High School is not your typical educational oasis, as becomes obvious immediately.  Mr. Noblet (Stephen Colbert) and Mr. Jellineck (Paul Dinello) are two unique teachers who play a big role in Jerri's life, dispensing such tidbits of advice as ""No one makes friends with a failure"" and ""You're only as attractive as we think you are,"" while enjoying an openly ""secret"" relationship of their own.  The towering force at the school, however, is Principal Blackman (Greg Hollimon), whose educational theories are, in a word, unusual and whose narcissism knows no bounds.  If you thought your old teachers were weird, you ought to take a look at these guys.
Jerri deals with many issues routinely covered in after-school specials: trying to be popular, dating, racism, dealing with peer pressure (as well as pressure from the principal and teachers), accepting a new student, coping with an extremely dysfunctional family (the most normal member of which, her father, appears only in immovable poses), and, of course drugs.  In the very first episode, she turns to what she knows - brewing up drugs - in her effort to become popular, only to watch a stoned girl try to fly through a keyhole.  Jerri can be a sympathetic character dealing with her step-mother's alcoholism one minute, and then the next she is assuming the role of an abusive husband to her baby care partner.  This really is one of those shows you can't describe; you have to see it to understand it.
There aren't a lot of extras on the DVDs, but what is there is fantastic.  The unaired pilot of the show was strange indeed, as it featured a much different look for Jerri, a step-mother played by the woman who would end up being Jerri's gym teacher, an after-school volunteer job for Jerri at a home for senior citizens, terrible music, and a completely different feel to the whole viewing experience.  The commentary provided by the creators and stars of the show, Amy Sedaris, Stephen Colbert, and Paul Dinello, is great fun.  While only four of the ten episodes from Season One include a commentary, the information, reference to gags and side jokes that I had missed up until now, stories about the sometimes seat-of-your-pants manner in which everything came together for each episode, and general humor they expressed at the sight of old scenes takes a Strangers With Candy fanatic such as myself to even deeper and more appreciative heights of humor and fun.
What is perhaps most strange about Strangers With Candy is its success at making good and relevant points about some of the serious matters it subjects to a humiliating treatment in the name of comedy.  I'm not entirely sure it does this intentionally, though, because the main point of concentration oftentimes seems to revolve around seeing just what they could actually get away with doing on television.  If you are content with the same old predictable humor that the networks recycle year in and year out, you probably should avoid diving into the deep end of the humor pool, but if you yearn for something else, something different, something so stupid that its brilliance shines forth like a shooting star zooming across a horizon populated by distant glimmers of comedic light, then you may just find something strange and beautiful and hilarious in this unforgettable show.",1057363200,49,4625,4.840304182509506

The fact that it is the only strangers with candy dvd on the market today should not deter you from purchasing it.  This show, is arguably the best Comedy Central series since Mystery Science Theater 3000.  It's a sick and twisted cross between The Wonder Years and Saved by the Bell.

1883155,5,B00009B8FW,"For the last few years I've been receiving requests at my website, jerriblank.com, for information about a possible DVD release of Strangers With Candy and, to be honest, I never thought that it would happen. I'm glad to see that I was wrong. It also appears to be a big seller, #8 on Amazon's list of top DVD's this week, 6/26/03. I've watched the episodes over and over and completely wore out my VHS tapes, so now that I have the DVD I don't have to worry about that anymore. And it's great to be able to pause the DVD to read the signs in the background on the school walls and admire the other subtle props created by Dylan Sheridan and the ingenious members of the production design crew. I'll certainly be buying more copies as gifts for friends and family. Not only is my mother a fan, but so are my nieces (I fast forward over the naughtiest bits for them, though).

1883156,5,B00009B8FW,This has got to be the funniest shows on the Comedy Channel and will hopefully become a movie.... This show is a blatant slap in the face of all of those teen-angst ridden movies with Amy Sedaris playing a 42 year old high school student returning to finish before 50. Also staring the super funny Steven Colbert (does this guy ever break up?) and Paul Dinello the comic genius as two teachers/lovers who attempt to guide the naieve Jerri Blank in her quest to become popular in high school. Maybe someday.... keep the dream alive Jerri.,1056585600,,537,4.604166666666667
1883167,5,B00009B8FW,"Thank you, Comedy Central for placing effort into your new rigorous DVD production for Strangers With Candy.  All of the episodes here are in pristine quality, definitely clearer than those grainy, insanely priced VCD bootlegs on ebay, and even better quality than their original airings on Comedy Central.  The pilot is bizarre to watch, but its wonderful for any SWC fanatic...the texture is much different than the show ended up being.
I heard somewhere that if this did well, Comedy Central would release the subsequent seasons, with the second season being released this coming November.  Well, as I write this, the 1st season set is #14 on amazon.com sales rankings.  So take heed, Comedy Central!
Also, I just found out that a deal has been signed for a film version of the show.  Just wanted to pass the great information along to everyone else.
But by all means, by a copy of this.  Buy a trillion copies.  Show it to your friends.  Bring it to the masses.",1056499200,,965,4.736526946107785
1883168,4,B00009B8FW,"I have been a fan of this offbeat comedy spin on the ol' after school special since it started in '99. Sadly it is now gone off the air, but at least we have it on dvd. This dvd has the original pilot (elements of which were used for other episodes in the season) and commentary (Amy, Paul, & Steve -- creators/stars) on 4 of the shows, it also has sneak peaks of other Comedy Central shows. The menus and packaging on this two disc set are funny and nicely done. I give it 4 stars and not 5 only b/c I want more extras (behind-the-scenes and commentary on more episodes), but really what more can you ask for when you are getting one of the best shows ever aired? The writing and the acting are superb. Bring on the other 2 seasons Comedy Central!!",1056326400,2,749,4.172413793103448

1883170,5,B00009B8FW,"Comedy Central's cult classic has finally made its way to dvd, something I pictured never happening.  After being cancelled, with only three seasons to its credit, I was afraid that ""Strangers With Candy"" might fade into obscurity.  Luckily, there were lots of fans out there who, like me, found it's dark, insane humor riotously funny.  This dvd offering gives us the first 10 episodes, introducing us to Jerri Blank, a 46 yr old ex con, ex prostitute, ex drug user---ex you-name-it! as she struggles while returning to high school where she left off after running away 32 years ago. As a freshman, Jerri must deal with trying to fit in, wanting to make friends, be popular---all the things a typical freshman wants in school.  Told in the format of the old afterschool specials that warned us of drugs, unwanted pregnancy, etc., this series worked brilliantly.  Thanks mostly, of course, to Amy Sedaris who plays Jerri Blank to perfection.  Add in Stephen Colbert and Paul Dinello as teachers (and closeted lovers) and an array of other characters and the show always hits the mark.  I love the relationship between Jerri and her step mother played by Deborah Rush, who plays this role to a tee.  The dvd offers a few extras such as running commentary during episodes and a bonus unaired pilot.  It was interesting watching this pilot, seeing how that changed Jerri and some of the situations she was in for the actual series.  If you are a fan of this show, this dvd is a MUST!!!  I've read that if this dvd sells well, the other two seasons will be released as well.  I hope that is true because there were so many classic moments in seasons 2 and 3.  Go out and buy this dvd now---run, don't walk!  You won't regret it.",1056240000,21,1724,4.628289473684211
1883171,5,B00009B8FW,"I watched Strangers With Candy haphazardly during its run, but because of Amy Sedaris' recent ascent to quasi-stardom, I decided I really wanted this DVD. This show is easily the funniest (and meanest) thing to air on television in the past ten years. Jerri Blank is one of the funniest characters ever to emerge from television, if only because of how far-fetched her entire schtick is. Amy Sedaris is incredible, comic gold. If you're a fan of Mr. Show, The Daily Show (not counting the...interview portion), or laughing at people on short busses (and apologizing for it afterwards but not meaning it), you'll get a lot of life out of this DVD.",1056153600,,646,4.776785714285714

It's subversive, it's dangerous, it's dirty, but it's also hysterically funny satire.  While many shows dumb down their humor to appeal to the masses, SWC has a very distinctive sense of what is funny, and is not afraid to hold to that sense.

7990819,1,B00009B8FW,"This ""comedy"" is a train wreck, starting with its star, Amy Sedaris, who plays Jerri Blank as a 46 year old high school freshman. They wouldn't let her get into high school at that age in real life. She doesn't wear her makeup right, and none of her so-called friends try to help her put it on. The teachers in real life would not talk this way to their students. In one scene, Stephen Colbert tells a student to shut his dirty mouth, and the student didn't say anything wrong!

 While none of the jokes work, some of the costumes garner a chuckle. Colbert wore a clownsuit in one scene, which was pretty funny, because he was acting like he was dressed normal.

None of the other reviewers speak of the dramatic moments in each of the episodes that, if allowed to play out longer, might have allowed me to give the show an additional star. For example, Principal Blackman stands by the window and ponders about having 3,000 students and less than a dozen teachers, then looks out to see a teacher's car being pummeled with bricks and bats by a half dozen students. But they never used the scene to point out racial discrimination that's at the heart of such savagery.

Saved by the Bell remains the gold standard of high school comedy, and Strangers with Candy never found the magic that Screech effortlessly showed week after week.

(And if you're still reading this, you can disregard the above - SWC is the funniest comedy I've ever seen, and I never tire of watching the reruns.)",1511568000,,1484,4.522388059701493
