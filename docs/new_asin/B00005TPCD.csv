1662431,3,B00005TPCD,"(Discussions of plot, fan-service, etc., are much better covered in other reviews. This review is exclusively to mention some behind-the-scenes information about the dubbing of this feature, from one of the voice actors in the show.)

I provided the English-dubbed voice for the engineer, Mikhail. Or was he the engineer? It's been so long since I've seen this thing (and I recorded it in 1997 or so), I can't really remember much about it -- which, I suppose, says something of the overall plot.

My use of a Russian accent was planned well; the execution of that accent wasn't planned well at all. I don't recall who decided that it should be that thick. In order for an accent to be believable and natural, it is often best to paint it on thinly rather than trying to go over the top. So my apologies right off the bat for that one -- I didn't do nearly as well as I could have done. My best contribution was to provide some actual Russian, such as ""Har' shoa"" (very good) and ""turok"" (stupid, or idiot -- much like the Japanese ""baka""). Please note the transliterated spelling of the Russian words is likely to be completely wrong; it's just how it sounds to my ear.

The story overall was given as much seriousness as we could gather for it, perhaps realizing that it really is a ""fan service"" flick at best. We (the voice actors) gave it a helluva shot, and that's about the best I can say on our behalf. This isn't the same caliber as, say, ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" or ""Serial Experiments Lain"", so it really didn't get the same amount of attention or expertise from any of us. That, I confess, is a failing. The Tao would tell us, ""Pay as much attention to the end as to the beginning, and there will be no error.""",1190419200,7,1723,4.44620253164557
1662432,4,B00005TPCD,"this anime is great,butit needs more episodes. if someone can ask the orig. animatores to put out a 12,13 or even better 26 episode show i'll be in line with cash in hand!!!!",1128816000,2,174,4.303030303030303
1662433,3,B00005TPCD,"It seems to me that people who reviewed this title either loved it or hated it. I myself think somewhere in the middle. The artwork in Plastic Little is very good, and in a way it is kind of funny. One fine example of this is when Captain Tita, and Elysse, are sitting together, after having seen a beautiful sunset, and just as they're talking about Elysse's code a spaceship comes out of nowhere and blasts out the window next to them. Yet another fine example is that the pilot, Nichol, kind of likes Tita, but he himself is very femminine, right down to his name.

Many people have said that there wasn't enough character development. I agree with them in some ways, but in others I completely disagree. I agree with them because there really wasn't too much character development. That's the thing though is that there doesn't need to be more than there already is. You get to know that Tita is kind of lazy, and that Nichol is kind of in love with Tita, and that's enough. Had this been made into a series though I am sure that there would have been much more development of the characters. As it is though the entire story is only 50 minutes long, so you can't very well fit too much in.

Many people again say that the plot wasn't good, or long enough, but I again agree and disagree. I agree because it truly wasn't that long, but again for the purposes of this type of anime, the plot doesn't need any lengthening, or shortening. I am sure again that had this been made into a full fledged series Elysse wouldn't be the only person Tita would run into, and I am also sure that there would be plenty of villans in the story as well.

Now for the most infamous bit; the nudity. I personally didn't see anything wrong with it. In the bath scene the two girls were just doing anything that they would normally do in a bath or shower. Of course this title was targeted at male viewers, but again it was just a scene with two girls in a bath, they weren't touching each other at all, except once when they were going down a water slide together. And again you have to realize that they were both women, and they didn't care what they looked like naked. Even when they had their tops off in the hospital ward, those times were only because of gunshot wounds, and the doctor was a woman.

All in all I liked Plastic Little, even though there were some bits and pieces in there that I didn't like. It was a little short, but there's nothing I can do about it now, so if you want to buy it go ahead!",1127260800,8,2499,4.265822784810126

""Plastic Little"" is one of those anime features which is confusing and hard to follow not because there is too much to keep track of, but precisely the opposite!

I first became aware of this title as a result of clicking through the preview trailers on one of my other titles. And despite all of the obvious 'tittage' I knew would be encountered in this OAV, the action scenes were of such adrenaline-raising excitement that images of ""Akira"" danced endlessly in my head.

My main concern was how could they possibly (or plausibly) squeeze so much into a less-than 60 minute one-volume story? Answer: When there is barely any story there to speak of.

""Plastic Little's"" biggest problem (apart from its indecipherable title and that distracting humungous ""shower curtain"" wardrobe accessory worn by our chief antagonist) is that it tries to cram way too much story into far too limited space.

""Little"" allows an insufficient time frame for any significant character development, that much is already a given ... but the rushed story also leaves a lot unexplained.

""Plastic Little"" needed AT LEAST an additional half-hour in order to address some if not most of these unanswered questions.

The artwork and animation are impressive, to say the least, which help supply this story with a certain amount of credibility it so severely lacks otherwise -- and which pushes it just past the ""Two-Star"" rating I likely would have given it.

My most vocal gripe, however, comes with regard to the vocal segments of the anime: The voice acting-- both Eigo AND Nihongo --are bad ... plain and simple!

And that infamous ""jiggle counter"" feature on the DVD was a needless and senseless addition -- but I suppose when you can't produce anything on a level of brilliance such as ""Mononoke Hime"" or ""Akira,"" you resort to frequent breast exposure.

Overall, ""Plastic Little"" is an impressive visual experience, despite my general dissatisfaction with it. If visual experience has a certain appeal, you could easily do worse, but if you're looking for something with a bit more substance in the form of a coherent story with reasonably decent acting, you may want to try looking elsewhere.

1662436,3,B00005TPCD,"This movie came up short of my expectations. It fullfilled all of the fanservice requirements, including an unnecessary but acceptable (for me anyway) bath scene.
The story was very dry and simple but the stong idea of comradery left me with a reason to have watched the movie. There were also some great character designs and very good environmental concept. Worth 15.99 but don't expect a classic.
Just accept a good flick.",1082419200,,425,4.916666666666667
1662437,4,B00005TPCD,"Captain Tita is a PET HUNTER who, with her crew, ends up saving Elysse Mordish from Lord Guizel, a Darth Vader want to be, who wants the computer code she has.  The code will allow him to use her father's work for evil.  That's the plot, no surprises or too many plot twists.
On the other hand it has LOTS of nudity, explosions and techno-babble to please most male viewers.  And the non-sexual relationship (or skinship as Patrick Drazen might call it) between Tita and Elysse could be enjoyed by female viewers.
It has ONLY 50 minutes so not a lot in character or plot development.  Think of it as a short film or a extra-long episode.  Extras include jiggle counter, sketches and storyboards.",1049500800,9,695,4.57258064516129
1662438,3,B00005TPCD,"Good things first.  This is easily one of the most breath-takingly, beautifully illustrated and animated anime out there, EVER.  The intricately hand-drawn and shaded character designs are beyond compare, and the frame rates are so silky smooth that probably only CG-3D stuff or Disney or Miyazaki stuff are more smoothly animated.  By that virtue alone, Plastic Little easily belongs on every anime fan's must-watch list.
Now for the bad.  If there ever was an award for an ""all glitter and zero substance"" anime, well, Plastic Little would easily win.  The story is quite laughable in its cliches and pathetic lack of logic.  Characters are annoyingly one-dimensional and have no depth whatsoever to speak of.  Worst of all, the storyline is disappointingly anti-climactic.  It should be criminal for an anime with such a rare striking beauty to be strapped to a storyline so unrewarding.
In all fairness, Plastic Little suffers the most from its own brevity.  It barely clocks in at 45 minutes, and that's including the ending credit roll.  If this was more of a full-length feature (say, 80-90 minutes), then there would have been a good deal of time to flesh out the characters and their relationships, and to elaborate on the futuristic society and its technology.
Heck, even with its current short length, the creators could have squeezed some of that into the storyline and have it make a lot more sense.  Instead, the creators chose to spend the time with numerous scenes where the female characters are seen either nude or topless, taking bath or being bandaged.  Granted, they are probably some of the most beautifully drawn breasts in all of anime, but I say that one such bath scene is enough for a 45-minute anime.  I'd gladly trade a couple of the topless bouncy-breast scenes for a better developed plot.
To sum it up, in terms of sheer beauty of the animation, Plastic Little belongs in the top 10% of all animations ever made worldwide.  In terms of intelligent, engaging, INTERESTING storyline, this one is near the bottom of the heap.  A total, utter shame.",1039219200,25,2077,4.911174785100287

7953853,3,B00005TPCD,"Plastic Little, an anime film that knows it's bad and relishes in that fact. The 'plot' follows Captain Tita, a 'pet shop hunter', as she comes across a girl, Elysse, on the run from some shady people and desides to help her out. The plot doesnt really matter in this anime as its main draw is its fan service (And there is a good amount!). The animation is good and fluid; looking like old school anime, or at least mid-90s anime. The characters aside from Tita and Elysse get very little to do, but with a run time of about an hour, I don't mind.

There isn't much substance in Plastic Little and I doubt anyone involved with the project thought they were making the next Akira, but they did succeed in making a short, fun adventure anime. So if you're looking for something to watch and willing to turn your brain off for an hour, then Plastic Little won't let you down. The nudity is an added bonus..",1485561600,,904,4.349112426035503

7953857,4,B00005TPCD,"This is a pretty classic anime that's been around for about 2 decades now.  The character designer, Satoshi Urushihara, is kinda known for his female character designs (for fairly obvious reasons), and this is one of his better works in that regard.

This is a rather short and simple OVA; it disappointed me that it couldn't have been an OVA series.  I liked where the show was going - maybe it was a primer for a future OVA with more funding, I dunno.  I would have liked to seen more of this anime, some sequels or something.  As it is, I am pretty damn stoked to own this movie again, after so long of having sold off my original VHS copy of it.  Don't know why it took me so long to repurchase it, TBH.

This Japanese illustrator got his start in old mecha designs for various 16-bit games, and then eventually moved on to manga.  Not much of his work has released in America, neither is this artist well known by anime fans here.  However, he is one of my favorite Anime/Manga artists, and I've kept my eye on this guy for awhile now.  The manga Chirality is an oldie but a goodie. Good luck finding it for sale; it was released in America so there is still hope.

The story is really sort of summed up as ""Anime Star Wars, but on the water"".  Tita is a young tomboyish girl who is a captain of a ship she inherited.  She mostly uses it as sort of a commercial hunting ferry of sorts.  She agrees to guide around this rich white girl Elysse after she rescues her from slave trading pirates, no doubt.  She somehow gets caught up in warring factions of a nation-state, and saves the day.  To be blunt, the important thing isn't the story here.  Just know that Tita (and later Elysse) end up getting injured and are treated topless in the medical bay of the ship by a Russian nurse at every opportunity.  There's also a pink haired DUDE who looks like a girl, for some reason.  Just putting it out there.

This was early Voice Acting over at ADV.  They were just getting the hang of such things and surely you don't expect the world here.  But the voice acting is NOT GOOD.  It's not terrible, mind you.  But also not high tier stuff.  Amanda Winn-Lee was the starlet of ADV at the time, she was their best VA period.  She puts in her usual 'shrilly enthusiasm' here - but overall this is the first ADV anime I watched where most of the cast seemed to put their hearts earnestly into the performance.  I think this dub isn't at the level of ADV at their prime (Excel Saga, Najica BT) but it's an early good start.

Now for the ender - brutal honesty!  I'm mostly here for the breasts.  Lots and lots of sexy boobs to stare at.  If you're into fanservice, you're gonna get it...ALOT of it here.  And you won't see me complaining any.  Conclusion:  not the strongest story or voice-over from older '90s anime.  But in terms of fan-service it's a freakin' classic - and doesn't really get much better than this for T&A unless you delve into the more seedy hentai offerings.  I like it overall though; one of my all-time favorite fluff animes.  4 of 5 stars.",1360713600,,3058,4.320422535211268
7953858,5,B00005TPCD,"This title brings me back to the early 1990's when I started getting into anime.  The animation was amazing at the time and still holds up very well, colors are bright, action is smooth, and all the design work is done by Satoshi Urushihara, which could be the deciding decision on this video alone.  The story is far out, but its a fantasy anime, so its not strange in that sense.  Urushihara's detail is amazing even today,  check the detail in the character's eyes, hair, and breasts.
If you want to check out a short, high quality, original OVA from one of the best decades of anime, get this video!  Its really affordable now too!  I paid $29.95 for a VHS of this back in the 90's,  you can easily own it now for less than 8 bucks.",1320537600,,736,4.2898550724637685
7953859,3,B00005TPCD,"Satoshi Urushima is best known for his work on such anime productions as Record Of Lodoss War and Bubblegum Crisis, or his designs for the Langrisser and Growlanser video games. However, a few of his own creations like Legend Of Lemnear have been adapted into anime as well. One is the oddly-titled Plastic Little, a one-shot OVA that was not originally a manga but the basis for its own action/sci-fi anime.

Set on a colonized alien world in the future, Tita is the spunky teenage captain of an airship/submarine called the Cha-Cha Maru whose crew seeks out exotic creatures. This trade is referred to as ""petshop hunters"", although it makes you think that they track down strip malls. Tita saves Elysse, the daughter of a brilliant scientist while she is on the run from the corrupt military. The highly-helmeted commander, Lord Guizel, plans to use Elysse's knowledge of a gyro system which sustains their nation's capitol in the air so he can take over the government. Tita takes Elysse back to the Cha-Cha Maru where she introduces her to the rest of her crew(who have some of the most stereotypical European accents ever!). Guizel eventually works out how to operate the gyro system, and its up to Tita to storm the complex and stop him. After making short work of the stormtroopers, Tita copies the ending to Return Of The Jedi by sending Guizel down an energy shaft. She then pulls out a Capt. Kirk-like deus-ex machina by exploding a typhoon to take out the rest of the evil fleet. Elysse leaves to help repair the damage caused by Guizel, which pretty much caused the entire city to be destroyed.

The OVA makes for a good story, although there was some pretty blatant boob-shots thrown into it, so much so that for its DVD release, ADV Films implemented their patented ""jiggle-counter"" with it. It features some impressive animation and character designs, plus the ending undersea battle is a real eyegasm. This is one of those anime titles that was a standard to own in the 90s, and I'd mainly recommend it to anyone from the era of gratuitous fan service!",1307232000,,2069,4.7444444444444445
7953860,4,B00005TPCD,"In addition to what it is well-known for, PL does have its own sweet teen romance a la Nadia-&-Jean.
Batten down, mateys: Spoilers ahead !
When Tina's father died (heroically,it is hinted),none of the crew felt worthy to succeed him. So they decided to name little Tina their captain. Practice made perfect, and little Tina grew up to become a quite capable captain indeed. She also grew up in other ways: she is now 17, and crewmen worry she might someday fall for some outsider hunk... Better keep things in the family. Young pilot Nichols is handsome and well-behaved (does that make him effeminate? I think not) and he adores Tina as his little sister. Would he consider updating his feelings? suggests an older mate. As Nichols protests that Tina is still too young and innocent, the mate takes him to Tina's bathroom porthole, and the young man gets the nosebleed of his life. Tina notices him and is furious.
Later on, severely wounded Tina wakes up in a hospital bed (and""barely"" covered) and finds Nichols asleep at her feet.  ""Not again!"" she groans - but then realizes that the poor boy is exhausted from waiting on her. Instead of slapping him, she gives him a quick peck on the cheek.
Things do not go any further in this episode, and I wish there were more, just to see how gentle Nichols will eventually capture the (nicely-wrapped) heart of his beloved Captain.",1222041600,2,1377,4.690082644628099
