8027574,3,B0002F6BLU,"El Coyote y La Bronca(1978) is a solid Mexican film. El Coyote(Vicente Fernandez) and La Bronca(Blanca Guerra) try to survive as outlaws. Some nudity, low brow humor, and Sam Peckinpah-ish ultra violence make this film a questionable choice for children and prudes. The film ""borrows a page"" from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid(1969). Angelica Vale, Angelica Maria's daughter, made an appearance in this film when she was young. Also, Gilberto Parra's music score gives the film some heart and soul. The lovely Blanca Guerra co-stars in this film; she has dark, silky hair, fair skin, a pretty face, and a killer body. She also appeared in Close and Present Danger(1994). El Coyote y La Bronca was made in the Mexican idiom...and it might seem ""too Mexican"" for some people. This film may turn off some viewers, but viewers who watch it with an open mind will enjoy it when it's over. Gloria Marin co-stars.",1258329600,2,911,4.883870967741935
