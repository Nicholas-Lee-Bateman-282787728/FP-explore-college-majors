2927163,5,B000UYN9PY,"The ""Carry On"" gang was unique and never before or after has British comedy been quite the same, although it is up there with Laurel & Hard, Abbot & Costello and Martin & Lewis in North America and of course Charlie Chaplain, born a Brit who came to the U.S.A.!",1357257600,2,261,4.24
2927164,5,B000UYN9PY,"Funny and not offensive like today's crap produced by Hollywood. British people have the best sense of humour !! Lots of double entendre's but harmless, good old-fashioned fun.",1356393600,,176,5.321428571428571
2927165,5,B000UYN9PY,"I cant remember them on TV but the 1969 one is the best, one is in black and white but all are good.",1356220800,,100,3.391304347826087
2927166,4,B000UYN9PY,This is the ensemble cast from the TV series--which is much of the cast from the films. It completes the collection.,1356220800,,116,4.571428571428571
2927167,3,B000UYN9PY,"Thought I was buying additional Christmas Specials. There were only 4 made and they'er all on one 'Carry On Christmas' dvd--If you want all of them, you'll end up with an  extra dvd.",1356220800,,182,4.515151515151516
2927168,5,B000UYN9PY,"As usual, this DVD lived up to the usual standard of the other carry on movies. It was worth the purchase.",1350777600,,106,4.095238095238095
2927169,4,B000UYN9PY,"If you know nothing about the British series of ""Carry On"" movies [such as ""Carry On Doctor"", ""Carry On Cabby"", ""Carry On Nurse"", etc] you might be a bit puzzled by this collection of Christmas TV specials that featured the ensemble cast in roles that would have been familiar to viewers.  However, if you enjoy the mildly naughty, slightly bawdy suggestive humor and physical comedy of Benny Hill, you will probably enjoy this set of videos apparently recorded in front of live audiences.  If this set appeals to you, Amazon also carries a box set of about 12 of the classic Carry On films. Simply type ""Carry On"" in Amazon's Search window.",1287792000,6,641,4.714285714285714
2927170,1,B000UYN9PY,Quite outdated and the humour is a bit too coarse.  Not as funny as it was back in the time the movie was made.,1258761600,3,111,3.625
2927171,1,B000UYN9PY,"I enjoy the British sitcoms on television - did not like this movie at all
to me it was truly a waste of time viewing it and a total waste of money
in purchasing it.",1198108800,3,165,3.742857142857143
2927172,5,B000UYN9PY,"This DVD contains all four Christmas specials and one hour of an interview with the producer.

For those of you who do not know about the carry on series, these programs are pretty racy with double meaning statements that involve British slang.  It is not suitable for young children.",1194652800,10,284,4.775510204081633
8215672,4,B000UYN9PY,Was purchased as a Christmas gift and the recipient was VERY pleased.,1514332800,,69,4.833333333333333
8215673,1,B000UYN9PY,"This includes an irreverent version of the Dickens classic, A Christmas Carol, called ""Carry On Christmas Carol.""

Some of the jokes are funny.  Some I didn't get.  I stopped watching it when old men in little girls' costumes started dancing the can-can.",1480291200,,254,5.0
8215674,5,B000UYN9PY,I loved this DVD!!!! This is for any fan of classic British comedy.,1409529600,,67,4.230769230769231
8215675,1,B000UYN9PY,"Its like watching plays not what we expected not like the other movies which are classics.
Would not recommend this.",1400457600,,116,4.85
8215676,5,B000UYN9PY,"This is the completion of my collection, and it's a corker. Sid James is in them (4 shows on the disc) along with some of the other regulars, and like I have said before; it is silly! But, I believe everybody should have a little silliness in there lives. I just wish the group was around today, making some more movies for us old timers to enjoy today. This is a great collection!",1393027200,,381,4.232876712328767
8215677,3,B000UYN9PY,"I've loved the Carry On movies for decades and have one of the collections available in the U.S.  This one doesn't cut the mustard, though.  Too, too stupid.",1391385600,2,157,4.571428571428571
8215678,1,B000UYN9PY,"I like the Carry On films, always have, always will, but these TV specials were really pretty dire.  The corniest jokes, haphazardly thrown together.  Painful to watch for the most part.  I made it through one and a half of them, but couldn't take anymore.",1389052800,,256,4.644444444444445
8215679,5,B000UYN9PY,"And DO it they do. Xmas will never be the same again and good thing too. Lift those presents, stuff that turkey, oooohhhh Mrs!",1372032000,,126,4.291666666666667
8215680,5,B000UYN9PY,"If you are not a fan of the Carry On films then you won't like this video. But, if you are a fan, then you'll love this collection of Christmas shows. Done in the tradition of the Carry On films, this is a collection of all four of the Christmas shows that they recorded. The shows star all your favourites like Sid James, Barb Windsor, Charles Hawtrey, Kenneth Williams, Kenneth Connor, Joan Sims, Bernard Bresslaw and many more!",1364169600,,430,4.5256410256410255
8215681,5,B000UYN9PY,the dvd is excellent quailty and arrived as expected. there is a lot of materila on this dvd and it represents excellent value,1361232000,,126,4.521739130434782
