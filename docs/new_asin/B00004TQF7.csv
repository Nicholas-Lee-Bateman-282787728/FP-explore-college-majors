1351659,4,B00004TQF7,I can say it is a cool movie really is like the days of the 1970's and 80's.  Some scenes in this are memorable here.,1512518400,,117,3.68
1351660,2,B00004TQF7,"Weak movie with a good soundtrack.  I kept waiting for the good part.  When my husband told me that it only is more of the same until the end, we turned it off.  If you are enamored by California and it's porn industry, then this might be the movie for you.  A little to reality based for me.  Just boring and sad.  I was not entertained.",1512086400,,338,4.045454545454546

1351662,5,B00004TQF7,"This is such a great film. You actually feel invested in the characters and care about what they go through being in an industry that's frowned upon (not by most people, but by a lot). The plot goes in directions that you don't expect, and there's a surprising amount of bloody violence that actually feels necessary and not just thrown in for violence's sake. Paul Thomas Anderson is one of the greatest directors working today, and I consider this to be his second best movie (""There Will Be Blood"" is first). Plus, if this movie can make me take Mark Wahlberg seriously, it must be good.",1511049600,,590,4.5754716981132075

1351669,3,B00004TQF7,"I saw this back when it was first released and wasn't impressed.  After seeing all the 5-star reviews here I decided to give it another chance.  I must say that my opinion hasn't changed much.  Yes, the cast was very fine (great performances by all) and sure, the soundtrack is great too.  However, I still don't see why so many people love it.  It's watchable, but nothing more.  I'll also say the only reason it's watachable is because of the excellent cast.  If this film was full of unknowns, I'd probably only give it 2 stars.  To each his own I suppose.",1508025600,,559,4.411764705882353
1351670,5,B00004TQF7,"I saw this movie 20 years ago when it was originally released and thought I'd have another go at it since it was free on Prime. It is still a classic and great film. Burt Reynolds is really great, he should have won an Oscar. I also really liked Julienne Moore, Bill Macy and Phillip Seymour Hoffman. The big surprise (and I thought this back in '97 when I originally saw the film) was how natural and good an actor Mark Wahlberg is since I had only known him as rapper Marky Mark and up until then thought he was a ho-hum talent. He shed his muscles for this film and really carried the film.",1506729600,,593,4.165217391304348

1351673,4,B00004TQF7,"very fine film. i wish pta would make more movies with this kind of sparkle instead of tirelessly working to be the next stanley kubrick, its at this point you realize he shines as A WRITER and that his directing is just an unashamed mishmash of scorsese, altman, demme, kubrick and others.  bit like tarantino. Anyway great movie, definitely his most well reviewed, telling that most of the 1stars (like always) are either idiots who didn't finish, or people who aren't sure how to use amazon properly",1503100800,,502,4.7701149425287355

For anyone who has grown up in the '70's and '80's, this movie is like looking through the window of a time machine.  This was the Valley in all it's glory, man, that is IT. And the adult film industry, what can you say? Don't judge. It pays taxes, it pays the rent, and puts food on the table. Compliments to the whole cast, especially Burt Reynolds, Don Cheadle, and Marky Mark Wahlberg.",1501891200,,474,4.5

1351679,5,B00004TQF7,"Boogie Nights is an extraordinary film. Everything is top notch, particularly the film making. Paul Thomas Anderson is known for his style and skill behind the camera and I think this is his best film personally. The story and acting performances are all fantastic. Burt Reynolds is amazing. Heather Graham as Rollergirl is probably the best background actor of all time since she is in about half the scenes skating around somewhere. The editing and music are great as well. If I had one negative thing to say it's that there is a really long scene toward the end of the film that, while a good scene, doesn't seem necessary to the overall film and it really drags the movie out at that point after a pretty perfectly paced film before that scene. But considering how excellent everything else is, it's a minor complaint.",1500508800,,822,4.715277777777778
1351680,5,B00004TQF7,"I have seen this movie dozens of times over the years. This is definitely one of my favorite movies of all time. It might actually be my favorite movie of all time. I can't think of another film that I enjoy watching more. One reason why I love this movie is because there are many layers to it. On the surface, it is just a movie about a guy who gets into the porn industry, but underneath that, it is really about the people involved in the story and their lives outside of porn and because of porn. The characters are what make it come alive. I was fascinated by the character played by Philip Seymour Hoffman. I was fascinated by Amber Waves and her relationship with Dirk and her relationship with her own real life son. Every character had their own personality and there was a part of me that cared about all of them (even if only a little). The minor characters are important and they make you care about their stories as well. There are parts of the movie that are hilarious and there are parts of the movie that are heartbreaking. At the center of it all you have a bunch of flawed human beings just trying to find their way in life. This is film making at its finest. This movie is an all around masterpiece.",1499472000,,1219,4.2813852813852815

1351693,2,B00004TQF7,"Richnography is far preferable to poornography.  Watching somebody else enjoying life does nothing for viewer lives.  No doubt Californicatia's felony religionist play actor Ronny Raygun's motivation for shutting down all places of worship of hetero religion in favor of his object rape con dumbs was partially based on subservience to the poornography busymess along with the felony enslavement demands of his ""religion"".

Gentlemen will appreciate Rollergirl and ladies will love Wahlberg, both have some hot scenes. There is a lot of sex/drug use and some violence so it goes without saying it's not for the wee one's.

1351710,5,B00004TQF7,"Once in every generation a romance movie comes along that truly  stays with you your whole life. A film that becomes a yard stick by which you measure your hopes and expectations of true love.  My grandparents had Gone With the Wind.  My parents had Dirty Dancing.  My generation has Boogie Nights.

Set in Los Angeles during the late 70s,  Boogie Nights follows the romance of filmmaker Jack Horner and the love of his life, an up and coming actress by the name of  Amber Waves.  Burt Reynolds and Julianne Moore exhibit a romantic charisma that easily sits atop the list great duos throughout cinematic history.

As with all great love stories,  it isn't always a smooth road for these two.  Taking in a group of young and upcoming actors and actresses with troubled pasts, Jack and Amber struggle to foster a happy home for their wayward protgs. All the while tackling the challenges of the movie industry and struggling to maintain their love which they hold so dear.  But it isn't all so serious.  Despite the day to day grind,  Jack always make sure everyone has a good time at the Horner house!  And you never know which one of Jacks crazy friends and employees might stop by!  The unique ensemble of side characters is more than enough to keep this film interesting.

If you are looking for a family friendly romantic movie, then I wholeheartedly recommend Boogie Nights.  Love, devotion, and sacrifice are what make this story something more than just a film.  It represents a dream we can all one day hope to achieve.  A true love that brings others closer to us amd makes our hearts overflow with happiness!  Rent it today!",1484524800,,1634,4.643356643356643

For it's time, I guess the movie was okay, but to me, it dragged. Occasionally, there was comic moments but, overall, the comedy was high school appropriate. It was nice to see how some of the cast have improved their art and moved on to bigger and better roles, except Bert Reynolds whose talent could only carry him so far, and no further. Not enthusiastic over this movie.",1483056000,,508,4.473118279569892

Still, I can only give it four stars, because I think a little more class could, and should have been injected into the movie!!! That is great that Julie Moore (or whatever Burts live-in girlfriends name was) was willing to show her titties, I chalk that up to limited movie roles for her, but the freckles just don't scream sexy to me!

1351751,5,B00004TQF7,Boogie Nights is one of my top favorite movies and a contender for favorite film of all time. It`s pure exhileration for 2 1/2 hours. A perfect 70s-80s period movie. It has an amazing cast who all give incredible performances. Mark Wahlberg disappears into his role as Porno star Dirk Diggler making the character his own and is by far his best performance. Burt Reynolds is stellar as well along with the rest of the cast. Tom Jane has a great role as well. Not really sure why he never became a star. P.T. Anderson brings us a thoroughly entertaining film with a classic kick ass soundtrack all the way through. The pacing and editing are masterful along with it`s cinematography. Boogie Nights got widely ignored at the Oscars but with the exception of the equally incredible L.A. Confidential its the best movie of `97 and one of the best movies ever made.,1461888000,,860,4.627450980392157

1351803,5,B00004TQF7,"Like Ed Wood, Boogie Nights is one of the forgotten masterpieces of the 90s. James Cameron's Titanic came out the same year and grabbed up many of the big awards and while Camerons film is a fun guilty pleasure, Paul Thomas Andersons Boogie Nights wipes the floor with it. Titanic is an entertaining piece of popcorn escapism; Andersons film is one of the greatest films of the late twentieth century. Coming off the heels of his strong debut Hard Eight, twenty-seven year old Paul Thomas Anderson delivered one of the best American films of the 90s, a film that always holds up on repeated viewings and, if anything, has grown on me over the years.

Theres something really magical about first-rate directors who are also first-rate writers; Billy Wilder, Francis Ford Coppola, Woody Allen, Quentin Tarantino, and the Coen brothers belong on that list and with Boogie Nights, Paul Thomas Anderson proved that he belongs on that list, as well. This screenplay (a reworked version of his earlier short film The Dirk Diggler Story) is filled with rich dialogue, fascinating situations, and some exemplary character development.

In Boogie Nights, Anderson was miraculously able to assemble one of the best casts for any film ever made and effectively utilize everyones talents to the best of their abilities; top-notch actors like Julianne Moore, Don Cheadle, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and William H. Macy do some of their finest work in this film and while Im not sure how it happened, Anderson was able to get a great performance from the truly never better Burt Reynolds.

This film has Scorseses style, Altmans scope, and Tarantino's sense of structure. The influences are obvious, from the long opening shot that recalls the openings to Orson Welles Touch of Evil and Robert Altmans The Player and the films final shot, a homage to Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull. Somehow, though, Andersons film never feels derivative; hes throwing a lot of his own ideas onto the screen and when hes borrowing, hes borrowing from the best.

Many young filmmakers wear their inspirations on their sleeves until they find their own voice, but Andersons voice here is clear: he captures the culture of the 1970s with great, impeccable detail. Its not just that he get the music or the clothes right; its that he encapsulates the decades mood: a culture of sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll, no doubt, but also a world of post-Vietnam and Watergate disillusionment. Boogie Nights focuses on the pornography industry in the 1970s and 1980s, but it never feels like a period piece; many latter-day films about this era seem to give little winks and nods to the dated elements of the periods they take place in, and while that may be fun, there's an authenticity and focus to Boogie Nights that is rare. I'm sure there are some slight anachronisms here and there, but there's no glaring flaws. Like Todd Haynes' Far From Heaven, it feels in some respects like an old classic that has been unearthed from a time capsule. (Both films, incidentally, feature the great Julianne Moore.)

As he would later do in Magnolia, Anderson creates a tapestry of richly developed characters and is able to sustain ones interest for the entirety of its perhaps slightly bloated running time; at 155 minutes, the film wears out its welcome a bit and probably could have been tightened up in places, but it doesnt much matter; this is a masterpiece. As the characters age and we enter the 80s, the film dips a bit for me, but the imperfections don't really damage the overall greatness of the film,in large part because each of the characters (even the minor ones) are brilliantly developed and I always films myself caring deeply about them; almost every character seems to be grappling with insecurities, either major or minor, and Anderson handles their darkness with warmth, empathy, and understanding.

I honestly cant think of a director since Altman who has been able to juggle a great ensemble cast with such ease, and while Paul Thomas Anderson has gone on to make other masterpieces (like There Will Be Blood and Magnolia), Boogie Nights remains a highlight in the filmography of one of the best living American filmmakers.",1440460800,,4189,4.917963224893918

1351834,5,B00004TQF7,"This movie has a lot in common with Pulp Fiction because it, like PF, spends its first half celebrating the glitter and fun of 70's SoCal pop culture and its second half trawling for the dark and seamy underside of that culture. Both movies make extensive use of 70's pop music to create and sustain a tone of bubble-gum insouciance. Both movies rely on subplots that are constantly crossing and criss-crossing over one another.

Where Boogie Nights succeeds, and PF falters, is that director Anderson manages his movie's second-half transition into sleaze and corruption much more competently than Tarantino does in PF. Anderson deftly handles three plot-strands at once: Dirk Diggler getting assaulted by gay-bashers; Jack Horner and Rollergirl beating the pulp out of an obnoxious fan; and Don Cheadle barely avoiding getting shot in a donut store hold-up. Anderson begins the sequence with a quick reference to a church and Christ icon in the background, and he ends it with Cheadle getting his snow-white outfit spattered in blood and brain matter. Anderson's point seems to be that none of these characters can escape their lowly origins. He strips all of these junkies and social misfits of their pretensions to artistic grandeur. Pornographers are smut merchants, not movie directors; porn stars are wanna-bes, not erotic actors. And LA, for all its sex and drugs and surface glitter, is grimy, gritty, and drenched with the blood of innocents.

Anderson can't compete with Tarantino with dialogue, but I do think that both films are equal on the level of visual style. Anderson has the better DP with Robert Elswit. His work here is amazing and you can tell that an Oscar was definitely in his future (for There Will Be Blood, another Anderson film).

In terms of actors, Anderson once again has the superior and more distinguished line-up. Burt Reynolds might be dressed up to look like Mr. B. L. Zebub, but his acting exudes warmth and compassion. You never trust his character, but there's nothing sinister about him, either. Julianne Moore is excellent in her role as a coked-up, dope-addled mother and ""erotic actress"" living in a world of eternal illusion. If it weren't for space limitations I'd go on, but just let me list some of the other actors: Philip Seymour Hoffman, Don Cheadle, Philip Baker Hall, Melora Walters, and Alfred Molina. Don't get me wrong--John Travolta and Bruce Willis both made huge career comebacks in PF, and you could argue that the excellent Samuel Jackson just walks off with the movie during the last 30 minutes. But overall, Anderson's cast is more consistent and more distinguished.

Many critics have noted that Tarantino and Anderson both started their movie careers in the 1990's. Tarantino probably got more attention than he deserved; Anderson has yet to receive the attention he deserves. Anderson has continued to produce work of distinction, whereas Tarantino continues to create comic-book movies based on American and European history. So I guess you have to make your own choice based on your taste and preference. As far as the comparison between Boogie Nights and Pulp Fiction goes, I'll stick with Boogie Nights, thank you.",1432425600,,3185,5.0494296577946765

1351839,5,B00004TQF7,"Boogie Nights is another great film by Paul Thomas Anderson, capturing the soul and essence of a fading era and the dawning of a new age.

Anderson makes complicated, multifaceted films.  Boogie Nights is no exception, casting this transition is the lives of a group of people, in this case the 'adult entertainment' industry.  With the waning years of the 1970s, an age of excess, melding into the 1980s, the me decade with a meaner streak, the film casts an penetrating eye on the lives of those who lived it, the winners and losers (and sometimes both).

Mark Wahlberg turns in a boffo performance as Eddie Adams, aka Dirk Diggler who dreams of stardom and an escape from a dreary life in the seedier parts of LA.  His dreams seem fulfilled when he's discovered by Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) an adult film director.  Dirk ascends the ladder of success, only to fall, far, into drugs and despair.

Highly recommended, especially to those who love complex, multi-layered films that offer more with repeated viewings.",1431388800,,1018,4.8497109826589595

1351850,5,B00004TQF7,"Boogie Nights is always a fun watch. Gather around and relive the wild 70's. Bert Reynolds is awesome in the movie with a great story line and a hint of sex. The cast is also great to include Heather Graham as Roller Girl. The best is a very young Mark Wahlberg. I a big fan and I attempt to collect all of his movies. His best by far are Pain and Gain and The Departed. Catch them both if you can.

1351853,5,B00004TQF7,"Director Paul Thomas Anderson is the symbolic heir to Robert Altman. His multi-character extravaganzas of social observation obviously owe much to Altman's influence. (And, he was Altman's assistant on PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION, his final film.)  This is Anderson's first, big, carnival type foray into Altman territory, after HARD EIGHT , his more modest, but worthwhile, debut.  It is a brightly colored, multi-layered extravaganza about the world of 1970s pornography, liberated as never before and wildly successful in seedy run down former neighborhood theatres. This all was altered when videotape raised it head and changed everything.  The production vales of a commercial film, even the 'grade z-level' went out the window with tape, and this film tacks about that transition. It's like the talkie revolution taking over from the silent era, only in a smaller, seedier  milieu. It lovingly paints a picture of so-called filmmakers, living the good life from the huge profits from their little epics, facing real disaster when any goofball with a camcorder can pull off a skin flick and market it for cheaps.  Wonderfully acted by a great cast; Burt Reynolds, Julianne Moore, Bill Macy, Philip Seymour Hoffman all have career making (or restoring) parts in this. Very funny and quite moving. The blu ray is veery nice, a big improvement over the earlier dvd and laser version, all of which I've bought. The commentaries are awful though. One, apparently was the result of the cast watching the video in a party atmosphere and is just a bunch of drunken snippets of chitchat and telephone calls, and the other, not much better... just Anderson, alone, but incoherent  But the film is aces.",1428278400,,1693,5.138181818181818

1351855,4,B00004TQF7,"It took me an entire hour into this movie to realize I wasn't watching something that my buddies secretly taped of me in my everyday lifestyle.  I was like, wait a minute... is that me, or Marky Mark sans the Funky Bunch?  Then I looked down and was severely disappointed.  Boogie Nights is one of those movies invented so that guys can simulate that feeling that little girls get when holding Barbie dolls and accidentally catching a glance in the mirror and turn the lights out so no one will hear them crying.  The movie had just enough sex and nudity to satisfy my male curiosity while at the same time teasing my imaginary girlfriend with the goods until the very end.  I hear at the very end of the movie, they replace Mark Wahlberg with an image of Chuck Norris, but it's so brief that your simple mind can't comprehend what you were seeing and you just start chewing your toenails and farting the national anthem in response to the confused emotions you begin to feel towards men.  Definitely invite mom and grandma over for a viewing of this one.  It teaches all kinds of morals and stuff, while being immensely informative about the plight of starving pornographers who only want to show the beauty of the human body like Michaelangelo's David sculpture.  I'm actually shocked there weren't leaves covering all of the male nipples exposed.  It made me think of important questions such as, ""Why are male nipples not taboo, when female ones are?""",1426982400,,1455,4.65234375

1351965,5,B00004TQF7,I love Scorsese-esque movies.  This movie has a lot of that going on.  But in my opinion Paul Thomas Anderson is reaching for something a little more deeply emotional than just raw with this effort.  I think he gets there.,1395705600,,222,4.5
1351966,5,B00004TQF7,"The very beginning of Boogie Nights sets the tone for the entire picture. A melancholy piece of sentimental music plays over a black screen before being quickly drowned out by an explosion of upbeat disco. It's almost as though PT Anderson wanted the audience to feel like they just snorted a line of cocaine. The brilliant tracking shot that follows does a fantastic job of introducing all the characters, but it is that first screen that sets the tone; Boogie Nights is not about the glitz and glamor of its time period, but rather the sadness and desperation that lies beneath the gilded surface.

The film follows a well-endowed and starry-eyed teenager named Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg), who escapes the turmoil of his home life by immersing himself in the sex and drug-fueled world of disco-dancing and hardcore pornography. Porn mogul Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds)and the sexy yet maternal Amber Waves (Julianne Moore)take Eddie under their wing, adopting him into their own twisted 'family', which Eddie is eager to join. As Eddie changes his persona to Dirk Diggler, the line between his real self and his on screen persona begins to blur, and the humbleness of his Eddie Adams is replaced by the ego-crazed arrogance of Dirk Diggler.

After watching Boogie Nights time and time again, I have come to realize how truly unique it is in that the tonal shifts of the plot seem natural rather than jarring. There is a lot of humor in this movie, and at the same time a lot of sadness. Like all great filmmakers, PT Anderson is a master at playing with the audience's emotions. Boogie Nights, as well as his next film Magnolia, are emotional roller coaster rides. The key to mastering this is good characterization and seamless tonal shifts, both of which Boogie Nights succeeds in getting right.

Tone is hard to define, but it can make or break a film. If a comedy is too serious, then it doesn't work. If a drama isn't taking itself seriously enough, then it doesn't work. Boogie Nights somehow manages to find that balance throughout its many tonal shifts, and for that it is a unique film watching experience.

Perhaps the biggest strength in PT Anderson's films is his attention to detail in regards to his characters. In this ensemble cast, almost all of the characters undergo an emotional journeys of some sort. The fact that even the most ancillary characters have a storyline makes the film seem more realistic, and this makes it easier for the audience to sympathize with their struggles.

The acting in the film is mostly superb, although truthfully I found a few scenes a bit too melodramatic. Mark Wahlberg did a good job, but in some scenes I feel he has a tendency to overact. However this is a minor gripe, and in the overall scheme he does a fantastic job revealing the emotional nuances of his character. John C. Reilly plays my favorite character in the film, Reed Rothschild, Dirk Diggler's best friend and eternal man-child.

Julianne Moore gives a highly emotional and affecting performance, and Burt Reynolds is, for once, not completely annoying. On the contrary, he gives another fantastic performance. Heather Graham is great eye candy for the film, but her character has a lot more depth than her 'rollergirl' persona might suggest. In some ways I find her storyline more interesting than Dirk's.

As someone who is a big fan of the music, films, and culture of the late 70's and early 80's, the setting of Boogie Nights appeals to me a great deal. The soundtrack is phenomenal, and the film uses it in some very unique ways. For example, who could forget Dirk's rendition of 'The Touch'? If you haven't seen the film yet, its worth watching for that scene alone! The film seems to have an appreciation for the time period, but also uses the changes of the period to represent changes in the characters, such as when the primary medium of porn changed from film to tape. This is masterfully done and a unique way to tell the story.

Boogie Nights is a finely crafted and emotionally engaging film that engrosses you not only in its story, but in its characters and setting as well. Its one of those films you can watch time and time again and never get tired because there is simply so much to appreciate. The only things holding it back from masterpiece status are some stilted performances, but for the most part it is a great achievement.",1395273600,,4372,4.743421052631579

1352013,4,B00004TQF7,"This film still has legs after all these years.  Since everyone else has already discussed the plot, acting, characters and whatever else, I will focus solely upon the quality of the transfer from Standard Def to Blu Ray.

VIDEO....
  Shot on film, this movie retains that soft filmic look.  This is not to say that contrast nor color resolution is poor, actually, both are very good.  At no time did I see any dropouts or artifacts throughout the film's viewing, it is a clean Blu Ray.  Details, despite strong contrast, are not as distinct as you might find in a newer release for today's films but that really doesn't become an issue for Boogie Nights.  Since I do not have the Standard Def release, I cannot compare but with an Mbps rate averaging in the mid 20's you can be assured of some improvement over the SD DVD.

AUDIO....
  As films often are, the audio takes a large back seat to the video.  Though the lossless Dolby True HD 5.1 audio provides clear and easy to understand dialogue there is almost no use of the surrounds or LFE channel for any foley fx at all.  Given that this film is largely a dialogue based movie, you cannot expect too much from the surrounds but there were plenty of opportunities for them if the audio has been properly remastered.  That said, the musical soundtrack was beautifully spread across the front audio stage in a stereo mode. So, on the soundtrack part of things, the editors succeeded.

Extras...
  Some really excellent extras on this Blu Ray with a plethora of deleted scenes that really might have taken the film in another direction as well as extended or altered scenes.  I really enjoyed watching them all.  In addition, you are provided the typical director's and cast commentaries which I haven't listened to or watched yet, and the trailer to the film.  I do not know if all the many deleted scenes are on the Standard Def release, but if they aren't, they make purchasing Boogie Nights on Blu Ray worth the inexpensive price.

Since all my reviews focus only upon the quality of the Blu Ray transfer and not story summaries, I do hope that this type of review has been of some help to you in regards to your purchase or not.

1352019,4,B00004TQF7,"Boogie Nights is a 1997 film by Paul Thomas Anderson about a group of performers, producers, directors and film crew members in the late 1970s and early 1980s pornographic film industry in southern California, when that semi-legal industry was transitioning from films shown in seedy X-rated movie theaters  to videotapes rented from neighborhood video stores.  Despite the titillating subject matter, the nudity and sex are kept to a minimum to maintain an ""R"" movie rating.

Standout performances by Burt Reynolds in his comeback role as ""Jack Horner,"" a director of adult films who sees them as something of an art form, and Julianne Moore as ""Amber Waves,"" an adult film star, common-law wife of Jack Horner and mother-figure to the younger performers, earned them Academy Award nominations for Best Support Actor and Best Supporting Actress, respectively.  Paul Thomas Anderson was himself  nominated for Best Original screenplay.  Reynolds won a Golden Globe award for his performance.  Mark Wahlberg as ""Eddie Adams/Dirk Diggler,""John C. Reilly as ""Reed Rothschild,""  Don Cheadle as ""Buck Swope,"" and Heather Graham as ""Rollergirl""--who takes off her clothes, but never her roller skates--all  give noteworthy performances portraying a close-knit group of adult film stars.  There are cameos by real-life adult film star Nina Hartley, as  the promiscuous wife of Jack Horner's assistant director ""Little Bill "" portrayed by William H. Macy, and former adult film star Veronica Hart, as the judge who denies child custody and visitation rights to Amber Waves.

The plot of Boogie Nights is loosely-based on the career of  deceased adult film star, John  Holmes, portrayed in the film by Mark Wahlberg.  A high school dropout in his late teens living at home with his parents, the Wahlberg character ""Eddie Adams""is a very well-endowed young man initiated into the adult film business by Jack Horner and Amber Waves.  Adopting the screen name ""Dirk Diggler,"" Adams quickly becomes the leading man in ""The Other Hollywood"" of American adult films and things seem to be going well for the group.  As the 1970s progress into the 1980s, however, cocaine use, unrealistic ambitions, and the stigma of being involved in the pornographic film business all take their toll on the group.

Boogies Nights is a good period-piece that does not glamourize the pornographic film industry.  Sex is portrayed as the industry's salable commodity, and producing adult films as a money-making business.  The adult film stars portrayed in Boogie Nights are physically attractive, but poorly educated and not very bright individuals.  They enjoy the sex and obtain a certain degree of fame and a decent paycheck from working on pornographic films, which they probably would not otherwise have obtained. Drug use is rampant.  Ultimately, the stigma of performing in pornographic films makes it a dead-end career move, not a stepping stone to mainstream Hollywood films but a stepping stone to nowhere.",1385078400,,2984,5.2775423728813555
1352020,4,B00004TQF7,An interesting film about the growth of the porn industry in the 70's just as VHS was really getting rolling and before the internet. Good actors and very much follows John the Wad Holmes career. A few actual porn stars appear in the film. Much notice on drug and alcohol use but that is what reality was in those years. It is set in the valley of Los Angeles where the vast majority of porn was made. Made before many of these actors became large stars. One of my favorite parts is the music that is done with it.,1384300800,,514,4.202020202020202
1352021,5,B00004TQF7,What's not to like. The porn industry in the 1970s when porn stars were having fun (at least some) in the industry was trying to make on a semblance of a real movie. It's sad tragic story of John Holmes but roller girl is really great. Doubt you could make nearly as interesting a movie about today's porn industry. May be one of the best Burt Reynolds acting he's ever done and we know where Mark Wahlberg's career has gone along with Kate Hudson. Straight up!,1383696000,,461,4.372093023255814
1352022,4,B00004TQF7,"Boogie Nights is without a doubt, one of Anderson's best films, certainly superior to Magnolia and only inferior to his dark epic There will be Blood. It follows a pornstar with the oddly humorous moniker Dirk Diggler (Mark Wahlberg), who starts of as a nobody high school dropout who is discovered while working in a nightclub in the late 70's by a man named Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds), who is a pornographic film director who seeks to add artistic value and merit to pornography. All of the fame and success eventually goes to Dirk's head and he becomes increasingly egotistical and vain, which adds a lot of the dramatic elements to this film, as well as the dark humor which permeates it. Along for the ride are Heather Graham as Rollergirl, a porn starlet who is known for always wearing skates, and Julianne Moore as Amber Waves, an older actress who serves as a kind of mentor to both Rollergirl and Dirk Diggler. In addition to the porn element of the film, there is also a heavy drug element which isn't all too surprising as the film takes place in the San Fernando Valley where drugs were rampant during this time. Overall it's definitely one of Anderson's lighter and more fun films, despite being quite heavy and dramatic at times, it's not much compared to films like Magnolia and There Will Be Blood. It's far more like Punch-Drunk Love in it's style and execution. Highly recommend it, and this is coming from a guy who doesn't even like pornography!

1352025,5,B00004TQF7,"5 Stars. Hands Down. One Of My Favorite Movies.

Boogie Nights is a 1997 American drama film written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. Set in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, the script focuses on a young nightclub dishwasher, Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg), who becomes a popular star of pornographic films, chronicling his rise in the Golden Age of Porn of the 1970s through his fall during the excesses of the 1980s. The film also features cameos by porn actresses Nina Hartley (as Little Bill's promiscuous wife) and Veronica Hart (as the custody hearing judge for Amber Waves' court case). The film was an expansion of Anderson's short film The Dirk Diggler Story.

In 1977, Eddie Adams is a high school dropout who lives with his father and alcoholic mother in Torrance, California. He works at a Los Angeles nightclub owned by Maurice Rodriguez, where he is discovered by porn director Jack Horner, who auditions him by watching him having sex with Rollergirl, a porn starlet who always wears skates. After a heated argument with his mother about his girlfriend and his sex life, Adams runs away from home and moves in with Horner at his San Fernando Valley home. After agreeing to enter the world of pornography, he gives himself the screen name ""Dirk Diggler"", and becomes a star because of his good looks, youthful charisma, and extraordinarily large penis. His success allows him to buy a new house, an extensive wardrobe, and a ""competition orange"" 1976 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray. Dirk and his best friend/fellow star Reed Rothchild are featured in a series of successful action-themed porn films.

The plot takes many twists and turns throughout the time allotted.
Many thrills and spills along the way, along with who I would consider a top-notch cast for its day.
If you have never seen this movie, it is truly one unforgettable and amazing experience.
A must-have for the truest movie collector.

1352029,4,B00004TQF7,"This is about the 2 Disc DVD set of BOOGIE NIGHTS
which is about the Adult film industry from 1977-1983
which i bought out of curiosity, i was curious to watch this version so i had to buy the DVD

One Director's perspective/version of the Adult film industry from 1977 to 1983
written and Directed by Paul T Anderson who must've done alot of research of the Adult film industry during the 70'S
cause most of the scenes are realistic and tragic especially the Drug scenes lots of Cocaine, Difficult to watch and sad.
so very well acted by Julianne moore and Heather Graham.
i'm not going to explain the whole film but here is some of the scenes

the film is set in California and the main plot is around Eddie Adams/Dirk Diggler played by Mark Wahlberg, excellent acting aswell
Mark Wahlberg's character is loosely based on Adult film star John Holmes, i've seen a Documentary on John Holmes life in the Industry
so i know that only some scenes that Mark Wahlberg played the character definitely was based on John Holmes and based on Fact
one of the factual scenes is where Mark's character is very coked up and couldn't perform any scenes
so he has a fight/argument with Director Jack Horner played by Burt reynolds (another fantastic performance)
and Eddie adams leaves the set and tries to support himself on his own by recording an album, Prostituting himself to get tons of money for recording contract
and there's more Dramatic/tragic scenes to follow after that.

there are other Characters based around Dirk Diggler in the film
Heather Graham's plays Rollergirl about 18-20years old who's obviously been brainwashed by the Director Jack Horner and definitely doesn't know any better

Julianne moore as Maggie plays Adult film star Amber waves who's a struggling mother, her ex husband has custody of her son
so she takes comfort in Dirk Diggler
the scene where Julianne and Heather character are doing excessive amounts of cocaine together, that's ridiculous and Disturbing to watch
maybe that was based on fact or Loosely based, who knows
but Julianne and Heather nail that scene, it definitely looks believable

old actor Robert Ridgely plays Colonel James who is Jack horner's Producer and financier
who happens to brainwash young teens under 18 actually into performing in Jack's films
one scene where a young Girl about 15 years old brought in by the Colonel overdoses on Cocaine, very Graphic scene
he is later in prisoned for child images, if you know what i mean very disturbing

Don cheadle plays another Adult film star Buck swope who tries to get out of the industry to get his own Legitimate business started
but can't get anywhere cause he's been type cast as a Adult film performer and the bank manager won't give him a loan to start his own business,
he tried to prove himself that he's better than that and wants to start his own business, very sad
but he then gets the money by a Convenience store robbery gone wrong very late at night, where the robber is shot and the store owner is shot
 so he takes the money and runs with it. with no witnesses

William H macy plays Little bill Thompson who's a assistant with Jack horner's films
get's very Jealous of his Wife played by Adult film actress Nina Hartley who sleeps around
Little bill snaps to breaking point and shoots his wife, her Lover and himself at Jack horner's news years eve party 1979
It's anybody's guess if this was based on fact or loosely based, who knows

after Dirk Diggler is fired for too much Cocaine use about 1982 Jack Horner sets out to find another performer with Rollergirl
Jack drives around in his Limo looking for another star for his films
they come across a College graduate who happens to be school friend of Rollergirl, the College freshman persuades her that he knows her from school
and insults her for being an adult film star, she denies that he knows her and pushes and kicks him out of the Limo repeatley kicking and punching him
with Jack horner joining in and she says you don't know me i'm a star etc
very disturbing i was shocked at the scene, Heather Graham's character definitely brainwashed by stardom, very sad/tragic

by 1983, Dirk Diggler comes crawling back to Jack Horner for help, Amber waves is still in the business much older now
there's a scene where she's staring at herself in the mirror and she looks mid 40's now
Jack horner compliments her and says she still looks Hot
Dirk Diggler is getting ready for another scene and the film ends and credits roll

very tragic and sad perspective on the Adult actors/actress's and Adult film industry from 1977-1983
very realistic drama the effects on the cocaine use is outrageous
maybe some scenes are based on fact that actually happened or are Loosely based, it's a matter of opinion really.

now to the special features, there is only 2 audio commentary tracks one by Paul Anderson and another by Paul anderson and the other actors/actress's in the film
the commentary is terrible i tried to watch most of the film with the commentary
definitely was not interesting, Paul talks about the cast a little bit and how the film came together but most of the time
Paul, Mark , Julianne are Joking around about some scenes
there is no making of featurette, no interviews with cast and crew. Disc 2 has Deleted scenes and extended scenes and has filmography on the cast but that is it
i thought there would be making of featurette at at least but none
so the extras are pathetic
the soundtrack is obviuosly 70'S Pop radio
the blu-ray release of this film is no different to the DVD release, has the same extras as the DVD so there is no point buying the blu-ray
just stay with the DVD release

i gave this film 4 stars based on the Actor's performances and the story,
this film is obviuosly for people who are interested/curious about the Adult film industry lifestyle during the 70'S and early 80'S.
very tragic and sad if you ask me considering if some scenes were based on fact.",1377216000,,5953,4.647338403041825

1352035,5,B00004TQF7,"Boogie Nights is a masterpiece ... and one of my top 10 favorite films. It's a great film experience, but like all PTA films it's challenging in one way or another. In this case, the subject matter, nudity or violence may bother some (although compared to present-day films people must be used it by now). It's not a classic Hollywood movie, and while multiple story lines are followed, it flows at a rapid pace. Anderson made great use of cinematography, editing and soundtrack (no wonder he was nominated for an Oscar for direction). The cast is amazing (Oscar nods there too), with many of today's A-listers in early roles.

Having it on Blu-ray is great. The quality is there PTA claims it's the definitive version. I appreciated finally getting the extras ... especially lots of commentaries.

1352051,5,B00004TQF7,"Boogie nights turns out to be a well detailed and believable look into the adult film industry in the late 1970's. Added to that is how well the film captures this period in Los Angeles where Cocaine, disco dance clubs, and flamboyant fashion were everywhere. Burt Reynolds delivers an oscar nominated performance that is without a doubt his best, and he fits the role of dirty film maker Jack Horner superbly. It was indeed a tragic moment when he lost the oscar. It should have been all his. Mark Wahlberg does an impressive job as a young dish washer who meets up with Horner and then rises to the top of the Sex film industry as the well endowed Dirk Diggler. All of the cast were amazing. So much so that John C. Reilly ,Luis Guzman, Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, and Don Cheadle all deliver oscar level performances. And especially Philip Seymour Hoffman who steals the show as a nervous and insecure overweight homosexual trying to fit in with the crowd and failing miserably at it. Everything about this film was well detailed, accurate, absorbing, and riveting. I especially love the interractions between the characters, many of whom are generally awkward people all trying like hell to impress one another. The film showcases very well how the rise to success in the sex film industry can quickly lead to a downward spiral and utter ruin. As fas as I am concerned the movie is a must-see masterpiece, and one that shows the reality of what the late 70's, drug abuse, and the sex industry was really like, and pulls it off perfectly.",1367971200,,1546,4.666666666666667

1352053,3,B00004TQF7,"It seems that the folks at RCA (later BMG and Sony) keep looking for new ways to market the material they own by Elvis. They package it by themes (Rocking, Love, Gospel, Las Vegas, Hollywood, Greatest Hits, Alternate Takes) or by remixing songs to achieve a new sound. Some concepts work better than others. The 50's, 60's & 70's box sets are great. This 1983 album, which was never released on CD, seems to be a reworking of ten of his 50's songs plus one from the early 60's. It seems that producers Tony Brown and David Briggs had some of the same musicians who played at the original sessions come in and add additional parts to the songs. The result is a very slight stereo effect to the original 50's monaural recordings. They also added a bit of echo on some of the tracks. This album will interest you only if you are driven to have all the unusual releases by Elvis. There is nothing really bad here, but your only choice is a vinyl record which can be transferred to CD. Since all of these songs are already available on many different CD releases, there is a question why these efforts to update his music are worth your money since they sound so close to the originals. I do find it odd that the producers included ""Little Sister"" with all of the other 50's material.

Here are the songs: ""My Baby Left Me"", ""Baby I Don't Care"", ""Little Sister"", ""Don't"", ""Wear My Ring Around Your Neck"", ""Paralyzed"", ""Baby Let's Play House"", ""I Was The One"", ""Rip It Up"", ""Young and Beautiful"" and ""Ready Teddy"".

1352056,4,B00004TQF7,"""Boogie nights"" starts out as a hilarious satire of (some aspects of) life in the late 70s and early 80s. The fashions are spot on and the party lifestyle is portrayed with a surprisingly almost wistful innocence. The nostalgia begins to decay and then rapidly detioriorates into chaos and violence as the decade ends, leaving at least one of us who came of age during the era cringing in memory of the ugly underbelly of the disco days, (despite having had no familiarity with the porn industry). Don't get me wrong, the movie is still pretty funny, even at the end, but the chuckles have become the nervous kind. It's never comfortable to watch an illusion destroyed in the light of reality.

The dialogue is intentionally corny, and the acting is really great; I'm impressed that so many top notch actors and actresses were willing to bare themselves, literally and figuratively, in such a risky venture. I also loved the way layers of reality are created by using the device of film within a film. This isn't a great movie, but it's a pretty good one, and the squeamish don't really need to worry; the pornography at the center of the plot is never graphically displayed. It's definitely not for everyone, but if you have a sense of irony (and any memories of the 70s night-life) you'll probably enjoy it.",1364428800,,1309,4.691304347826087

It was a simpler time, before raunch and the internet, when small-talented, but greatly-endowed stars made a living knocking out badly-plotted porn films. Great story line, showing how drugs, egos and new technology called video tape) changed the industry.

The cast is superb! William F. Macy, Mark Wahlberg, Burt Reynolds, Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Don Cheadle and John C Reilly and others make their dim-bulb characters sympathetic and believable. And the soundtrack is terrific - throwing together great hits for many genres, including ""Mama Told Me Not To Come,"" ""God Only Knows,"" ""Fooled Around and Fell in Love"" and ""Boogie Shoes.""

1352085,4,B00004TQF7,"I didn't give it a fair chance. My first review of Boogie Nights was extremely negative. I have since viewed the movie again, paying closer attention, and have arrived at a different conclusion. Boogie Nights is very unique. At first it's a parody of the porn industry and one director in particular, played by Burt Reynolds. The Donnie Wahlberg character is most likely based on the late (and great) John Holmes. As Boogie Nights proceeds, that which was flippant and funny in the beginning gradually turns ugly and dark and violent. I'll say no more other than: yes, Boogie Nights does have ""redeeming social value.""

Personally speaking, it baffles me how adult movie stars can be so nonchalant about performing all types of sexual acts in a studio, under the bright lights, with a yelling director and a dozen or so crew members looking on. It must not take long to get over that embarrassed feeling. Boogie Nights illustrates that point quite well.",1353801600,,953,4.846625766871166

music - both period songs and score.

Somehow this manages uses the world of porn film-making to examine
families, American politics in the 70s and 80s and all sorts of serious
themes while also being a flat out blast to watch. It was criticized a
bit on release for plagiarizing Scorsese, especially 'Goodfellas', but
to me this is homage in the best sense. Taking great work done by
others and building on it to create something new. Indeed, the
excitement I had on first seeing it reminded me of my first falling in
love with Scorsese's kinetic work as a young film fan many years ago.

1352098,5,B00004TQF7,"One of those outlandish films that made such a mark in the world of cinema that it is still regarded (by many) as one of the best films of the 90's.  Considering that 1997 alone is one of the best years for film in the 90's, this is certainly must see cinema that completely redefined the way we look at entertainment.  With an all-star cast, a sharp script and such visionary direction, `Boogie Nights' is nearly flawless in its ability to completely transport the audience to a world far removed from anything they may be accustomed to.

Infamous porn star John Holmes serves as the inspiration for Paul Thomas Anderson's film about Eddie Adams, a busboy turned porn star nicknamed Dirk Diggler.  Adams is discovered by producer Jack Horner who sees big things from Adams, especially when he sees what he's working with (below the waist) and so Dirk Diggler skyrockets to fame as a real recognizable star.  Life isn't all roses though, and as Dirk begins to allow his career and legendary status to go to his head, he starts to bite the hand that feeds and assume that he can't be replaced.  When he's reduced to giving a show in the passenger seat of some random stranger's truck, he begins to witness the truth behind his downfall.

Whereas `Wonderland' (the 2003 film starring Val Kilmer) took a more direct and serious approach (and thus got in its own way because it tried too hard), `Boogie Nights' understands the perfect balance of comedy and drama, creating a universe of characters and themes that feel relevant and approachable despite their apparent separation from normal everyday life.  This is thanks in large part to Paul Thomas Anderson's ability to completely invest his signature vision into every frame.  He stokes the flames, giving such style and refreshing exuberance to every moment captured on screen.  He allows his characters to come full circle.  He isn't afraid to expose them and degrade them yet he obviously doesn't hate them in the sense that some visionaries can be accused of (Haneke or von Trier have been accused of hating their characters, and one can understand that observation) because he shadows them with a sympathy that helps the audience relate to them.

Watching Amber Waves fight for her son or watching Dirk Diggler fall into despair is very moving.

With fantastic performances from the entire cast, including an Oscar worthy turn from Julianne Moore, a devilish Burt Reynolds and a surprisingly on point Mark Wahlberg (his finest performance to date), `Boogie Nights' is a tremendous feat in modern filmmaking and deserves its place in the catalog of `greatest of the 90's' because, quite frankly, it is.  Anderson's ability to weave this web with such passion and entertainment value is quite impressive.  This is far from a mere exploitive exercise in smut filmmaking, for `Boogie Nights' handles its risqu themes with a touch of class thanks to the tonal shifts Anderson masters so effortlessly.  With uplifts and obvious dips into darkness, `Boogie Nights' gets everything right.",1339545600,,3035,4.933202357563851

1352101,5,B00004TQF7,"Though 15 years have passed since the first showing of this 1997 diatribe about life in the 1970s from the darker view of the `entertainment industry', it still remains one of the better spoofs of how everyone will sacrifice most everything for a moment of fame.  Written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson this story is one about a family of pornographers and their antics and relationships and anti-relationships and how seeming innocence can blossom into a wild ride of crime and drug-addled existence.

What makes this noisy, overly long (155 minutes) loud mess of a film work so well is the cast of actors gathered for both bit roles and leading character studies. Burt Reynolds is the director head of the porn family who `discovers' Eddie Adams AKA Dirk Diggler  has a prodigious physical attribute that is guaranteed to `make him a star'.  Rather innocently Dirk becomes involved with the porn industry but falls down that road of drugs and crime with the only remaining attribute being the anatomical part that is responsible for his rise to fame.  Along the way we met his fellow porn star John C. Reilly, the gay photo crew member Philip Seymour Hoffman, porn queen Julianne Moore, Heather Graham on skates, Don Cheadle as a former porn star who gets caught up in a Tarantino-type murder spree in a doughnut shop, Alfred Molina as a zany coke-head, and other characters played by Thomas Jane, William H. Macy, Nicole Ari Parker, Philip Baker Hall, Melora Walters, Luis Guzman... it just goes on an on.

Anderson creates multiple vignettes that allow us, the audience, to understand these wildly crazy people's need for acceptance and for forgiveness and redemption.  The film has become a cult project - one that despite how fine he is in this role that Mark Wahlberg would probably rather see just go away (especially his final scene).  It is a colorful, feisty, naughty, fun peak at the forbidden.  It will be around for a very long time!  Grady Harp, February 12",1330041600,,1978,4.825443786982248

1352106,5,B00004TQF7,"This review explains how this movie made me feel:

I saw this great movie when it first came out in the 90's. In the 70's, being single and about the same age as the characters, I hardly noticed how well Boogie Nights depicts that era. But revisiting the movie in 2011, I can fully appreciate how well it portrayed the culture & times. And this movie is the 70's and 80's on steroids. So if you are curious about that era, THIS movie will really interest you!

So genuine is Boogie Nights that I felt I'd gone back in time and simply popped in on the wild pool parties... the acting so good that I felt like ""Didn't I know Amber?""

All through the 70's, porn was popular among young adults, the singles crowd... Behind the Green Door, Deep Throat, The Devil in Miss Jones, etc... we singles talked about them and some of us even got to see a few. But back then you had to see the porn flicks in the theater, and frankly, there weren't a lot of them that dared show XXX especially where I lived in the Atlanta suburbs. Even though they were popular, it wasn't exactly a movie you'd go see on a date, and my girlfriends and I didn't go either. So after I was married in '77, I did go see a few with my husband - mainly out of curiosity after all I heard. I remember wondering ""Who ARE these people? Are they turned on by what they're doing? What were the cameramen thinking?"" Later when the movies came out on video, they got passed around to view in the privacy of your own home... something so fantastic to be able to see without going to an X rated theater.

What I love about Boogie Nights is that it answers my questions and more like: ""What was their lifestyle like outside the filming? Weren't these people concerned about ruining their acting reputations? How much money did they make? What ever became of them?""

And now it seems entirely logical that these people were probably high on drugs especially cocaine which was all the rage.

There are unanswered questions about several episodes in the movie: what happened to the girl who over dosed on cocaine at the party? what happened to ""the Colonel"" - did he remain in prison for child molestation? But you see, these characters didn't really exist and yet they feel as if they did!

I viewed this on Amazon's new instant view which is in stereo. The quality is good, but I honestly recommend purchasing this movie because you'll want to see it at least several times.",1312848000,,2427,4.3919821826280625

Somehow this manages uses the world of porn film-making to examine
families, American politics in the 70s and 80s and all sorts of serious
themes while also being a flat out blast to watch. It was criticized a
bit on release for plagiarizing Scorsese, especially 'Goodfellas', but
to me this is homage in the best sense. Taking great work done by
others and building on it to create something new. Indeed, the
excitement I had on first seeing it reminded me of my first falling in
love with Scorsese's kinetic work as a young film fan many years ago.

1352117,4,B00004TQF7,"Boogie Nights tells the story of Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg) and his life in the adult film industry of the 1970s and the 1980s. Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) discovers Eddie Adams working as a waiter at a club. After partying with Jack Horner and his many friends and associates, including Reed Rothchild (John C. Reilly) whom he befriends and strikes a close relationship with, Eddie Adams decides to go by and stick with the title Dirk Diggler. Dirk Diggler becomes a hit due to his size and charm, and the notoriety and money comes along with it. Not everything is perfect, however, in this colorful and lively landscape, and when things go from bad to worse the story continues to follow everyone from their rise and fall, from their attempts at their ambitions to their dangerous habits. Horner and company find themselves in a world of chaos and confusion, and Dirk Diggler along with Reed Rothchild end up doing no better.

Boogie Nights is brilliant and bizarre, frightening and funny, creative and compelling. It's one of the greatest films of the 90s and Paul Thomas Anderson is as talented and as ambitious a filmmaker as Stanley Kubrick. Part of what makes Boogie Nights so brilliant is the cast. There isn't a single performance here that is weak. Everyone is given enough screen time to really digest and express their characters that they play. There is a lot of character development here as the cast is huge. It's simply astounding how much we learn about so many characters. There's a lot going on throughout the film, but we never feel distracted by anything else. Every character has so much depth, so much personality, and so much truth that you almost never really want to leave them. This is the kind of film that could go on for multiple hours and it would never get any less entertaining. From the opening shot of the film we are in this world. We meet nearly all of the main characters in the opening shot of the film, and there isn't a single mannerism that comes across as false.

Boogie Nights is one of the most ambitious and confidently made screen epics that I have ever seen. It's probably the most flawlessly made epic since The Godfather or Fanny and Alexander. I am very confident when I say that at least two-thirds of the movie-going public would agree. I mean, when have you ever seen a film full of so much of everything? It's the kind of film where you feel like you live through it. I see it as operatic in scope. The cinematography is simply breathtaking. The feeling of the times of the 70s and the 80s comes off so strongly here, and yet it's not overwhelming. It never, for one minute, feels like a stylistic touch. It works and interweaves itself in with the storyline in such a powerful way. There isn't a single unnecessary scene here. There isn't a single scene that hits a wrong note or comes across as pretentious or pandering or cheap or accidental. So much care was clearly taken in depicting these characters in the strongest and most humanly way possible. Anderson isn't afraid to surprise us, but he also isn't afraid to try too many new things. The film is emotional and beautiful. It is creative, very dark, very gory, but also very funny. Few films are littered with so much energy, both visually and emotionally, nor filled with so many memorable lines and hilarious truth. It's the kind of film where you don't have to feel uncomfortable about laughing at, whether due to it's ironic situations or it's incidents, because you feel invited to.

Paul Thomas Anderson isn't trying to strike any sort of personal truth with this film It is simply about a large family who have ambitions and have dreams, but because they have gotten involved in this world and have become a part of this world they have alienated themselves for greater things. We realize these things almost immediately, and the film is about these characters coming to realize these things as well. It's a coming-of-age film that just so happens to take place in the porno film industry. Along the way we get several references to the life and times of porn actor John Holmes. There's a hilarious scene in which Dirk Diggler has a documentary made about his life and we see Dirk say the same words that John Holmes said in an infamous interview that hinted at the fact that Holmes embellished the truth about a lot of aspects of his career. It is absolutely hilarious, and Mark Wahlberg does an outstanding job in the role. We see a lot of these kinds of mannerisms throughout the film from Dirk, and it all rings so true and so sad. Burt Reynolds does an equally brilliant job. I dislike him as an actor, but his work here is full of depth and subtlety. I like how Anderson doesn't judge his characters. If anyone is going to make a film about the porno industry, THIS is the way to do it!

If there is anything wrong with the film, it is that Anderson doesn't quite go far enough. I liked this film a lot, but I wanted to LOVE it. Anderson keeps his camera at a distance from all of his characters and all of the events, and while it is an effective technique and it is a strong and effective technique, it also keeps the viewers from being able to get really involved with the world of this film. We, as the audience, are not invited to REALLY sink our teeth into this subject matter. As a result, by the end of the film, you are left feeling a little cold. These aren't the kinds of characters you really want to re-visit. I have the same problem with The Godfather. I think Paul Thomas Anderson was still trying to get used to the technique of filming a large cast. He did eventually perfect the technique with Magnolia, but it's something you have to really get used to if you're going to ENJOY this film. I think it's a great film. I think it's a little overrated. I think that it is, at times, very disturbing and I am baffled that this got away with an R rating while Peter Greenaway's The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, & Her Lover got an NC-17, but nevertheless, it's a great film. It really showcases Anderson's skills and confidence as a director, and, while you may not actually like the film, you will certainly admire it to death.",1284508800,,6167,4.533213644524237

1352124,5,B00004TQF7,"BOOGIE NIGHTS is a great movie by all accounts -- great directing, acting, story, screenplay, photography, music...etc. PTA is probably the best director out there as of now. BOOGIE NIGHTS is an American Dramatic Epic about the 70's Porn scene in Southern CA. I own the DVD of the film but the BLU RAY experience was even better. The DOLBY TRUE HD audio pops with power and detail and makes me appreciate the sound mix even more; I should say that there is a little hiss and crackle in third act of the film in the audio track which I kinda liked but it may bother some people. Perhaps the original mix was created as an analog master (rare but doable) and hence retains superior fidelity but a few analog crackles in the DOLBY TRUE HD BLU RAY mix.

The BLU RAY picture quality is a dramatic jump above the DVD and Itunes HD which looks soft, compressed, and washed out in comparison. It looks like the BLU RAY used a  TELECINE transfer from the 35MM which makes sense because PTA color corrected this film the classic analog chemical way instead of doing a Digital Intermediate. Color and resolution is full and they even preserved the stylish film grain which many BLU RAYS try and remove. I love that the grain was maintained in the image as it actually adds to the perceived texture of the picture and is closer to what the director PTA intended.

Director's commentary on this BLU RAY is one of the best out there and I wish PTA would do the same with THERE WILL BE BLOOD and MAGNOLIA.

1352132,5,B00004TQF7,"The Film:

Sprawling, messy, and relentlessly entertaining, Boogie Bights was, in my book, one of the two or three best films of the 1990s. Its themes include the innocence of an era, the relentless march of time, and the attempts of people caught in this march to create a family structure - whether it be a traditional family or a non-traditional one. Like many of Writer/Director Paul Thomas Anderson's films, this is a real actors' showcase, with Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Don Cheadle, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, among many others, turning in bravura performances. But it is, of course, Mark Wahlberg who sells this film. I haven't liked everything he's ever done, but his unpretentious style really fits the character here.

The Blu-Ray:

This is the best this film has looked on home video. The New Line DVD, which was one of the best DVD discs in its day, was very good.  This is better in every way. Blacks are darker and more solid, film grain is more evident, color is richer, and detail is much stronger. That said, this isn't a disc that will blow away some of the more CGI-heavy modern action material you can throw at your HD setup on Blu-Ray. Part of this is due to the way Anderson shoots scenes, with naturalistic lighting, focus, and different film stocks. When we're in a brightly lit scene with close ups, detail is very strong. I am glad that they didn't overdo this transfer and try to make it ""overly"" HD. There is little to no visible edge enhancement, and definitely no visible noise reduction.

Sound is very strong, with a 5.1 channel Dolby TrueHD that excels in almost every way. The music, so important to this film, is separated throughout the sound field with lots of detail. Dialogue is clear and never drowned out.

In terms of extras, we get almost all of the material from the New Line Platinum Series DVD. Two very entertaining commentaries, 30 minutes of deleted scenes (also with commentaries), extra improv footage, a music video, and the theatrical trailer are given to us. Unfortunately, all of these features are in standard definition, directly lifted from the DVD. We are also not given the ""color bars"" from the original DVD, which contained a blooper outtake of the prosthesis Wahlberg wore. I also would have liked to see the ""Exhausted"" documentary about John Holmes that Anderson used (and references frequently) as the inspiration for the documentary sequence in the film. It's not terribly long, and having it as a point of comparison to the filmed scenes would have been really good.

One final note - this disc has NO commercials. You pop it in, get an FBI warning, a brief New Line logo, and then the movie starts up. No fuss, no muss. I LOVE IT.

Conclusion:

Anyone who is a fan of great cinema should get this movie. If, somehow, you've avoided seeing this and you have a Blu-Ray player, this is a must-buy. It's by one of the great young filmmakers of our era, and it may be his best movie. If you love Scorsese, Kubrick, Robert Altman, Oliver Stone, and the like, you'll love this.

If you have the DVD set already, I would say this is a still a recommendation. The picture and sound are quite a bit stronger, without a doubt, and you get almost everything from the original DVD extras.",1265241600,,3250,4.666083916083916

1352136,5,B00004TQF7,"In the 70's, Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg) started out as a barboy at a night club. Cleaning up at the club, and performing sexual acts for money, one day he comes across Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) who realizes his ""talent"" and asks him if he wants to be an actor. Appearing under the stage name Dirk Diggler, Eddie becomes a big time porn star in the 70's. Everything seems great as the booze, drugs, and sex flow at first, but when as they move into the 80's their good times start to unravel.

It's hard to remember a time when Paul Thomas Anderson wasn't a world class director, especially when you look at the fact that There Will Be Blood came out in 2007 to great critical acclaim and gave PTA a Best Director nomination and a nom for best picture. It's just as hard to remember a time when Mark Wahlberg wasn't an A-list celebrity known more for his movies than for being Marky Mark from Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch, or the little brother of Donnie Wahlberg from New Kids on the Block. Although they both had made movies prior to Boogie Nights, Boogie Nights is the movie that launched both director and actor into the stratosphere.

Boogie Nights is a movie that shows Anderson as an excellent writer and as a director with his own vision. A self-described fan of John Holmes work, Anderson crafted a movie that excellently shows the rise and fall of the booming pornography business of the late 70's and early 80's through his main character the ""Wad-esque"" Eddie Adams. With his script, Anderson creates real characters, not just charicatures of the actors he idolized as a teen. Each of his characters has highs and lows, quirks, beliefs, and feel truly lived in and real. When they hurt, we hurt. When they do something wrong we scream at them, but they never feel unnatural. With his directing he effortlessly recreates the world of the late 70's and 80's paying homage to his filmmaking idols like Martin Scorsese (the long one take shots roaming through parties and following characters reminiscent of Goodfellas, as well as Eddie talking to himself in a mirror a la Raging Bull) while never feeling like he's outright copying them. In essence, while using the porn business to craft his film, he's really paying homage to film in general, not just the porn industry at it's peak.

The acting in this movie, ironically for a movie that deals with the porn industry, finds the actors working at peak form. And when you have talent like the talent in this film you can't go wrong. With Julianne Moore, John C. Reilly, Luis Guzman, Don Cheadle, William H. Macy, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Philip Baker Hall, and Alfred Molina you can't go wrong. The real standouts in this film though are Burt Reynolds (who earned an Oscar nod for his performance) and Mark Wahlberg. Burt Reynolds plays Jack Horner as something of a fatherly figure to his actors. An expert business man who is always calm cool and collected, but has a fire bubbling underneath. On the opposite end you have Wahlberg who plays Eddie. Expertly, he portrays Eddie with the innocence of a boy who is wide eyed at the life he gets, but once he gets it that innocence makes him full of himself. Wahlberg expertly follows every necessary tick to truly bring this character to life. I would also like to throw out an honorable mention to Heather Graham who gives one of her best performances in this movie as well.

I highly recommend this movie. Naturally, it's hard for us Americans to get over our hangups about sex, and make no mistake there is a lot of it in this film. But if I may be allowed to make a comparison, this movie is almost like Goodfellas, only with the porn industry instead of the mob. If you like Scorsese films, good acting, dramas, and fun movies I highly recommend this movie. Naturally, be sure to keep the kids away from this movie unless you've had the bird and the bees talk and want them to learn more about it visually. Go for the story, stay for the acting, and wait for the big reveal at the end, it's totally worth it!

1352137,5,B00004TQF7,"This came out in 1997 - the year of Titanic-mania - and years from now, I believe film historians will be scratching their heads trying to figure out how James Cameron's super expensive blockbuster won the Oscar for Best Picture while this wasn't even nominated. I've watched Boogie Nights dozens of times now, and it has become one of the most cherished films I own. I ought to point out that the actual making of porn films has very little to do with the story this film tells. It has more to do with the porn film environment - the parties, the lifestyle, and most importantly the personalities. Overall, it feels like a story about how the 70s turned into the 80s and how hard it was for this group of people to adjust once everything the 70s meant for them just up and vanished. The good life has a downward slope. But on the way to the 80s there are so many wonderful scenes with such wonderful dialogue and humor, supported by an amazing cast (so many actors in Boogie Nights have become stars in their own right that I doubt any producer could afford to assemble this group again). A highlight for me is Mark Whalberg and John C. Reily recording a cheesy rock album (with such inspired lyrics; ""My heat will rock you, my heat will roll you;"" ""You got the touch, you got the power!"") and then trying to convince the studio owners to give them the tapes they haven't paid for. Burt Reynolds turns in his best work since Deliverance. Julianne Moore is wonderful. Reily and Whalberg are hilarious throughout. The time period is re-created with loving care; fashions, decor and detail from the era are plentiful. This is such great storytelling! There are many individual storylines, but they all complement each other beautifully. It's hard to say how much the plot was influenced by real life stories, although it does seem like the coke-fueled shootout near the end may have been suggested by John Holmes notorious involvement with a murder around the same early 80s period. Director P. T. Anderson is in full Scorcese emulation mode, and I think it pays off. What can I say; this film is a feast.",1260921600,,2103,4.5809018567639255

1352139,4,B00004TQF7,"I complained a lot about films in the '80s which were too stiff and self-conscious to pull off a period piece attempting to portray another decade.

So what a relief it was when the '90s started and it was apparent the new decade wouldn't have the same problem.

1997's BOOGIE NIGHTS, about the porn industry of the late-'70s, is terrific fun for any number of reasons: the casting, the production design, the ""period"" style of the thing... Burt Reynolds plays a slightly pathetic porno-director at the end of the grainy, earthy sex-on-celluloid era which is about to be overtaken by the videotaped, sanitized, twinky zone of the '80s... Other actors are noteable, including Heather Graham, Don Cheadle, Julianne Moore, etc. Oh, and how could one forget Philip Seymour Hoffman and his quivering boom-mike??

But Mark Wahlberg's casting makes the thing work, not simply because of his build (a lot of buff actors exist out there) but his demeanor--- his relaxed, lost, slightly forlorn, semi-arrogantly knuckle-headed vulnerability... he absolutely SCREAMS late-'70s teenager. (I'm not sure if Mr. Wahlberg has ever understood how ""right"" he got it with his performance).

The movie, naturally, is a bit of a parody of the time, yet within that spirit of parody, gets the disco era much, much more right than it does wrong. Period zeitgeist is always made up of more than just mere physicality, and BOOGIE NIGHTS, through whatever method, manages to convince you that 1977 is actually 1977. And that's no small praise.

There are some elements the film probably misses. When one recalls the late-'70s --- especially as it might relate to the sex/porn industry --- it's might be easy to ignore or forget its aspect of superlative sleaze; it was the time of early-Sex Pistols (before ""real"" punk got cleaned up in the '80s), CALIGULA, CRUISING, Studio 54 (no, not that terribly watered-down film with Ryan Phillippe years later) when a certain sexuality of degradation seemed to reach its apotheosis... If you side-step or miss that ""sick"" note of that time, you've almost missed the time... Admittedly, BOOGIE NIGHTS, deliberately or not, doesn't ""get"" that element; it's all a bit too giddy and innocent to do so (although that rings true, too). And yet I'm kind of glad it didn't go into that gutter; otherwise, the film would have likely slid into something else too unseemly, and the things it got right might have run the risk of being negated or overshadowed.

A good, delightfully silly picture. And it's pretty impressive that PT Anderson, so young at the time, could pull this off so correctly.",1250553600,,2601,4.981566820276497

1352143,5,B00004TQF7,"""Boogie Nights"" debut in theatres in October, 1997, and went on to cement itself as one of the best films Hollywood has ever produced. The film is about a young man, played brilliantly by Mark Walberg, who enters the porn industry because of a certain ""asset"" he possesses,and its through his character that we meet others, like him. The film has many storylines that are interwoven, and we soon see why these people, porn stars, porn producers, and the like, are brought together and why they stay together; they are almost like a family, as most have been disowned by their own.
 The film is filled with some of the finest actors, like Julianne Moore, Burt Reynolds, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman. This is probably the best thing Reynolds has ever done, and Hoffman had his first starring role in this, playing a gay guy who falls in love with Dirk Diggler, played by Walberg.
 One of the greatest transformations of any character in film takes place in this piece, as we see Dirk going from a shy, innocent young man to an arrogant, pompous, rude, drug infested person. ""Boogie Nights"" depicts what happens to many, who enter the porn industry, make a lot of many fast, and get caught up with hard drugs like cocaine.
 The film is based on the life of legendary porn star John Holmes, who himself went from being the biggest star in adult cinema, to a coke addict who died very young from AIDS.
 Paul Thomas Anderon, who also wrote the Tom Cruise vehicle ""Magnolia"", wrote and directed ""Boogie Nights"". The film garnered three Oscar nominations, including one for Burt Reynolds in the Best Supporting Actor Category. The movie would go on to gross over $40,000,000 at the world wide boxoffice.
 This particular DVD is excellent, with newly restored audio and video and 10 deleted scenes. This set is similar to the Platinum Edition that came out years ago, but the print is cleaner and there is an amazing deleted scene in the newer DVD, that dramatizes Becky Barnet's life after she left porn. In this scene we discover she is being battered by her new husband that she married on New Years.
 ""Boogie Nights"" is as best as movies can be, and it shows that people who do porn are indeed human, albeit, humans that are in an industry that are shunned upon by the average person, yet these average people are the first to secretly buy porn and view it for their personal pleasure.",1238976000,,2379,4.6389548693586695

1352145,5,B00004TQF7,"I first saw this movie in the theater back in my college days.  I think it's the only time I've been ID'd to get into a movie.

Hands down, this is Mark Wahlberg's best movie.  And the soundtrack is perfect!  With all the stars and great performances in this movie, I was surprised to see it didn't get more awards than it did.  The story of the rise and fall of a young, up and coming, physically gifted porn star.

I'd suggest this movie for anyone who lived during the end of the 70's and the start of the 80's.  Heather Graham as Rollergirl is outstanding.  Don Cheadle playing Buck, the porn actor trying to start his own business and find himself was perfect for the role.  The acting is superb:  Burt Reynolds, Julianne Moore, John C. Reilly, Luis Guzman, William H. Macy, Phillip Seymour Hoffman... I could go on and on.  There's comedy, action, drama, dancing, singing...

1352147,1,B00004TQF7,"I expected so much more from this movie.  The characters are disappointingly vapid, empty, and largely forgettable as they spiral downward into a maelstrom that they can't seem to get a clue about.

Is this movie one of those moralistic ""Don't Let This Happen To You!"" pieces, giving folks a list of reasons why NOT to go into the porn movie industry?  Or is it a warning to film professionals that they should NOT work with director Paul Thomas Anderson?

Some great talent here is largely untapped due to a lackluster script that would be like watching a soap opera on the Humdrum Channel, had it not tried to shock the viewer with its violence in the last act of the film.  Even the sex scenes are boring.  I didn't expect or hope to see real sex acts, but I DID expect the sex scenes to be sexy, alluring, steamy.  They weren't.  But to be fair, maybe that was the point, being that the film is about pornography -- which surprisingly can be just as un-titillating as this film.  The nude scenes certainly weren't worth having respectable actors bare all for.

As for the reviewer who thinks actor Mark Wahlberg is blessed (cursed?) with the same schlong as his character, one must remember that this is a MOVIE.  I no more believe that we saw Mark's actual appendage than we saw Nicole Kidman's real nose in ""The Hours""(which is a far more interesting and intelligent film than this!)

What ""Boogie Nights"" lacks is captivating characters and a scintillating plot.  As it is, the experience of watching this film is more like being locked in a room filled with celebrity look-alikes who have nothing to do, but they vaguely remind you of someone you've seen before.

If you want to watch a movie about real sex and sexuality; one that actually has multi-dimensional characters and a story that draws you in, I recommend John Cameron Mitchell's ""Shortbus"" instead.  It's fun, it's thought-provoking, and stands up to repeated viewing due to the fact that the film, the acting, the interwoven plots, and story development succeed on so many levels.  Mitchell could certainly teach ""Boogie Nights"" director Paul Thomas Anderson a thing or two...",1234310400,,2147,4.7466307277628035

Burt Reynolds won his Oscar for this performance, but I can't imagine how. I can think of several actors who would have been as good as Burt, and many that would probably have been better, because the role doesn't demand much of an actor.

Mark Wahlberg was good as the young man in the movie, but he's been much better in several other movies.

Perhaps I'm a product of my generation where great porn is easily accessible on-line 24/7 or perhaps I'm just jaded altogether, but this movie wasn't even campy to me; it was just too long and too dull.  Good performances by William H. Macy and Juliann Moore but that's about it.  The story is about a young guy who is supposedly ""gifted"" (wtf?) who makes it big in the porn industry during the disco era.  When a new recruit is added to the porn line-up, Dirk Diggler (Mark Wahlberg) gets jealous, loses it and gets fired, blah blah blah.

The final shot mentioned by almost all the other reviewers is almost comical.  The thought of deer sausage in intestinal casing crossed my mind.  It might have been an erotic shot if Dirk Diggler's ""gift"" had been alive instead of dead.  And, I've been fortunate to have been presented with much bigger ""gifts"" in my life, wink-wink, nudge-nudge.

This movie is probably one for the old folks who lived the disco era.  I don't recommend it to anyone born after that time period because you'll probably be bored like I was.",1225411200,,1219,4.5159817351598175

1352155,5,B00004TQF7,"I was pleasantly surprised by this film after being persuaded by my Amazon buddy and friend, Clint Bronson to see this.

This 1997 film is loosely based on John Holmes the legendary porn film star of the 70s and 80s.  Instead of John Holmes, the character is Dirk Diggler.  A young bus boy, Eddie Adams, (Mark Walberg) is discovered by a porn film director, Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) at a San Fernando Valley night club.  It is well known that the busboy sports  a 13 inch you-know-what.  He then changes his name to Dirk Diggler and becomes the most famous porn star.  But along with that comes life in the fast lane---drugs and rock-n-roll.  Dirk spirals out of control and takes others with him.

This film also stars Julianne Moore as the porno ""queen mother"" ---another great performance!

I never once blinked my eyes, even though it was a bit long.  The plot moves very fast and is full of action, a must see!!! I believe, one of Burt Reynolds' best films.",1217721600,,965,4.5523255813953485
1352156,4,B00004TQF7,"Boogie Nights is a very entertaining film--the very impressive sophomore effort for director Paul Thomas Anderson. It's a great showcase for the acting talents of Mark Wahlberg, Julianne Moore, Burt Reynolds, and the fabulous ensemble cast. Indeed, Burt and Julianne were both nominated for Oscars for BN, as was director Paul Thomas Anderson for the screenplay. Burt almost partially redeemed himself for portraying Congressman David Dilbeck in Striptease. BN is a cautionary tale about drug use and its effect on the individual as well as the culture, especially during the late 80's and early 90's. It is about the adult film industry as it went through a transition from film to video, and also a cautionary tale about the adverse effects of working in that industry on interpersonal relations. Finally, it seems to be a story of an alternative family, a group of misfits that cling together after hitting rock bottom, searching for a family-like connection when their own families may have failed them, or vice versa.

Here are just a few observations on Boogie Nights: Film maker Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) is serious about film and resists compromising by shooting on video. Yet, from the clips shown from his films, they are out of focus and very amateurish. It is mocking his artistic pretensions at every turn. All the characters are mocked, especially the main character,

Dirk Diggler (Mark Wahlberg) who though he may be getting awards from the adult film industry is no Mickey Spillane when it comes to a private eye character he conceives for his films; and when he later tries to launch a career as a rock and roll singer it is clear that he has no musical talent whatsoever--yet he thinks he'll be signed to a major label deal any second now.

Reed Rothchild (John C. Reilly) is an even more pathetic wannabe, who recites one of the worst poems ever written (come to think of it, I wrote a similar poem--but I was 4 years old!!!!). He hitches his wagon to Dirk Diggler's star and follows that wagon right into the gutter.

Buck Swope (Don Cheadle) works at a hi fi store, but he clearly doesn't understand anything about the technical aspects of stereo systems. He is turned down for a small business loan when he wants to open his own store because of his adult film background, but one doubts that he could make a go of it even if he had gotten the loan. Miraculously, he does achieve his dream, but only due to a highly implausible deux et machina. Not only that, he affects a black cowboy look that is so wrong, though he looks even more ridiculous wearing a Rick James wig.

Amber Waves (Julianne Moore) wants custody of her son, but is clearly unfit. She is laughed at in court by the judge and jury when she tries to wrest custody from her ex husband, played by John Doe from LA punk band X. She does, however, make a great mother for her surrogate dysfunctional family of Dirk and Rollergirl.

Little Bill (William H. Macy) is certainly mocked, and his wife (Nina Hartley) doesn't even have a name. She is credited only as Little Bill's Wife, just like Lot's Wife. We don't know what she was named other than that she was turned into a pillar of salt. Little Bill and his wife's tragic deaths cause barely a ripple on the Boogie Nights stream.

Scotty J. (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) is certainly mocked for his unrequited crush on Dirk Diggler, not that he doesn't deserve the mocking. Last laugh: Phillip Seymour Hoffman gets the best actor Oscar for Capote. Take that, Mark Wahlberg.

I will say that Paul Thomas Anderson is certainly a director to watch out for. He seems to have come out of nowhere, but actually was born in 1970, so he is from the video generation, and is from San Fernando Valley. He went from grip to auteur overnight, and his access to films on video has given him an almost encyclopedic knowledge of film. He quotes from the masters, yet no copycat he, he is very original. He has made several other films that I have heard a lot about, and I am looking forward to watching them. In spite of his contempt for all of the characters in Boogie Nights, and his seeming disdain for the adult film industry, he does temper that contempt with empathy, and after making them suffer and hit rock bottom for their myriad inadequacies, he allows for all of the happy ending that his dysfunctional family unit will allow. And I was entertained. Bravo.

Dirk: Aren't you gonna take your skates off?
Rollergirl: I never take my skates off.

Dirk Diggler (Mark Wahlberg) quote from Boogie Nights:

Dirk: [in a documentary about him made by Amber Waves] What can you expect when you're on top? You know? It's like Napoleon. When he was the king, you know, people were just constantly trying to conquer him, you know, in the Roman Empire. So, it's history repeating itself all over again.",1216598400,,7718,5.978260869565218

Unlike what most people may think about this film, it is not pornography.  But it does examine characters in the context of the porn industry of the late 1970s, early 1980s.  The characters are interesting and their stories allow you to see them as more than mere stars in Horner's productions.

1352161,5,B00004TQF7,"I think men and women alike love pornography, at least for the most part, and those of you who don't particularly like it, I am sure have indulged themselves in it at one time or another whether it be due to curiosity, or the inability to get a partner.  Anyways, it's a controversial industry, and this movie proves to be pretty much no less controversial.  And I like controversial films, those that push boundaries and ideals, and even morality as a whole.

But, ok, Eddie Adams is a busboy at a popular night club, frequently frequented by some of the biggest names in the pornography industry.  Of course, it's a pretty good distance away from his home, so you pretty much get the gist of his 'gift', so to speak, and what he wants to do with said 'gift.'  Director Jack Horner is enamored by Eddie nearly right away, even when Eddie offers to 'wax the dolphin' for 10 dollars.  And Eddie (who transforms into the legendary Dirk Diggler), Jack, and Jack's coke-fiend lover Amber Waves (played exquisitely by Julianne Moore) all become a very successful happy family.

And, that's when the rags-to-riches saga starts to fall apart as the natural 'I'm the star, I'm better than you' syndrome becomes largely apparent.  Eddie/Dirk develops a cocaine habit himself, falls in somewhat with a bad crowd, and it all falls apart, and it does so for nearly everyone else so tightly wound into the porno business.

We gratifyingly watch porn fairly often whilst visiting our local video rental places with their lovely adult titles, or porn shops ala V.I.P.,. and I'm sure even some of us have dreamed of being a porn star, of how wonderful it must be.  I think this movie is a great portrayal of the side we don't get to see, because in the end, those still tightly wound in the porno industry have certainly lost more than they have gained...

Marck Wahlberg plays a simple down to earth unknown waiter to suddenly rises to porno stardom because a movie director played by Burt Reynolds hears about his well endowed member via hearsay. He gets him into the business. Mark Walhberg transforms into this screen name of Dirk Digler. He becomes famous and rich. He is unique in the industry for his ability to sustain long time erections, ability to come when the director demands it and offcourse the size of his member. He comes the directors preferred actor. We are also shown bit of the family life of Dirk and what leads him to this industry. The industry has all the evils of drugs and alchol. Juliane moore plays the female porn diva who is addicted to cocaine and abviously looses her custody battle on her child. Juliane is disillusioned and wishfully believes she is doing nothing wrong and that she should be able to have custody of her son. She far gone and has a mental breakdown. Dirk gets competition when the director (Burt) introduces a new face. Dirk disklikes the competition and fears the center of attention will slide from him. He has a showdown with Burt. Burt throws him out due to his outburst. Dirk then doesn't get any movie offers. He tries his hand at being a singer. Fails miserably. We see him get back to the poverty of life and trying to make ends meet doing real low stuff (like beating off to strangers who have the kinky desire to see such stuff for money. In the end he even finds himself in a robbery turned to mad mayhem killing where a friend of his hatches a plan to defraud a wealthy plan by providing him fake cocaine for money. After all this Dirk is completely down and he has no where to turn. He has become so humble and all the hot air has gone. He returns to the director,
sobbing and asking him to forgive him and take him back. They reconcile and Dirk will get back to the way he was. The porn industry always shocked me for being so freakish. The movie tries to address the issues of how the stars conduct their daily lives. It shows the drugs that go on. And also shows how fast you can get in and be number one and how fast you can get back to zero.

Now for a 2007 release of a tne year old film you would expect them to have come a long way since the original release on DVD. Not so in my opinion as the only bonus here is the second DVD with all the extras. The film itself is amazing and the actors are superb. The dialogue is clear but everything seems muffled and coming through the same channels. The only surround is when hearing music. The picture is a little soft as well. There does not seem to be a great improvement, if any, to the encoding from the original DVD to this one. It would have been great to have a Blu-ray version of this film...especially in 2007! If they do, hopefully they can remix the sound while they are at it.

In the end, I'm not sure why they chose to re-release this film for a third time. Aside from the extras, nothing is worth running to the store for.

1352167,4,B00004TQF7,"Those who think of Boogie Nights as a porn movie (or even a movie about porn) or whose primary lingering impression of the film is a salacious remembrance of Mark Wahlberg's crowning glory in the last scene are really missing out on what made Paul Thomas Anderson's trip back to the adult film industry of the 1970's such a great story. Okay, let me concede right off that watching good-looking young people cavort skyclad in protracted segments of simulated swivying isn't without its appeal, but beyond that, Boogie Nights recreated a bygone time and place and non-judgmentally cast out a story about complex characters who lived amoral lives, and did all this in such a way that not only does any viewer with half a soul come to care about people who might otherwise easily repel him, but it also rapidly becomes apparent that these same people also care about each other. With its depiction of the rise and fall and apparent rise (hey, no pun intended, I promise) of a porn star named Dirk Diggler and the transition of the adult industry from film to home video, Boogie Nights races through subplots about ambition, societal punishment of deviation, the consequences of drug abuse and marital infidelity, unrequited homosexual attraction, and its revelation of how a family can be created from unlikely strangers. This truly is a movie about a lot more than just the making of porn. It was also supposed to do for Burt Reynolds's career what Pulp Fiction did for John Travolta's, but this was not to be. Furthermore, seeing this 1997 movie in 2007 adds perspective, not only in that we are now an additional decade removed from the mores of 1970's, but as a means of reflecting on how we as a society have matured (or not) as based on how we are able to regard Boogie Nights today.",1189036800,,1786,4.691082802547771

The film stirred up a lot of attention at the time. The director rightfully received lots of attention and praise from the right quarters. The film's vulgarity has its own message. Casting Burt Reynolds was a stroke of genius. Who knew how completely Reynolds would fulfill the role of the porno film director? One forgets that smirk. Nobody can smirk like that; not, that is, until the arrival of George Bush on to the national scene. The cast is without a doubt one of the best in film history, Not since Coppola found Pacino and company has a film introduced so many major talents to the world. Mark Wahlberg, Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Don Cheadle, John Reilly: and the amazing thing is that they have all gone on to stardom. Young Hoffman, a brilliant actor in his own right, is hilarious as the paunchy gay boy. The film is profoundly revealing, deep, and at the same time a major entertainment, light airy, colorful, sexy. It is simultaneously an indictment and a celebration of the era, its perversions and its breakthroughs. We are both better people and far worse off since those heady times.

1352171,5,B00004TQF7,"When this movie came out, I wondered how this could possibly live up to the hype it had generated.  Boy was I pleasently surprised to see that this movie did just that.

Mark Wahlberg divorced himself forever from his former Marky Mark persona when he plays a fresh faced loser who works as a busboy at a disco.  One night, he is approached by none other than Burt Reynolds, making him the proverbial offer he can't refuse.  So he accepts, rechristens himself Dirk Diggler, and becomes absorbed into the world of adult films.  Here he meets the family he never had, achieves the success he never thought he was capable of, and is on top of the world.  His ego is out of control, and he dives headfirst into drugs.  Based loosely on the biography of 70s porn star John Holmes, Dirk and his friends narrowly escape violence (while John Holmes would be ruined by his association with the Wonderland murders).

What is the point of this?  Some were wondering, myself included.  The true horror of this story is not just in Dirk's story, but in the antics of the other characters.  Amber Waves wants to see her son but her ex husband won't allow it because of who she is and who she hangs around with.  Burt Reynolds is trying to make art in an industry that is admittedly sleezy and is drowning in a sea of videotape and amateurs.  One and his wife just want to get out of the industry all together and start over, but they hit dead ends in jobs and bank loans.  Roller Girl just wants to be more than the girl on skates.  And the characters that you see at the parties - young, innocent faces who are taken advantage of somehow.

The cocaine scenes capture the paranoia of drug abuse perhaps better than any other scene in movie history (with the possible second of Good Fellas when Ray Liotta thought he was being followed by the helicopter).  And perhaps the most telling of scenes, for me, was when Burt (a.k.a. Jack Horner) takes Roller Girl out on the town in his limo, wanting to film a random encounter.  It just so happens the man they pick up off the street was an old high school classmate of Roller Girl's.  He's willing to do the deed with her just like every other pig frat boy man (hard and fast and not sexy), and he puts her down afterwards.  She was attempting to be in charge, to show him who really had the power.  While the crew beats him up, Roller Girl gives him what for.  If that's not a microcosim of the porn industry thoughts and feelings, I don't know what is.

What is the point?  The point is that they all just wanted to be loved.  And the end?  When they all come back together?  It's the prodigal son story, all of them coming back together and reconstituting their family.  This is where they find love.  It's a happy ending after all.  Strange?  Well, sure it is.  But not as strange as all the situations of people who have left their families or real friends to return for forgiveness.  And we do forgive, and we become families again.",1181606400,,2969,4.3791208791208796

1352175,5,B00004TQF7,"It's about the porn industry and the ramifications that it hits upon on a group of people espeically a young man.

Paul Thomas Anderson is one of my favorite directors. You know why? His sense of direction and his superb writing skills are what make him stand out from a crowd of other wannabe directors. The way he develops characters and feeds them lines that make you want to laugh, cry, or be amazed. He also can control multiple story lines at once in his writing and his direction. He makes it seem like that it is effortless to do that. It seems plausible to say that P.T. keeps topping himself in every movie that he makes. He keeps making better and better progress on each of his films in his direction style and scripts.

The acting, in the movie, was solid. I was surprised that Mark Wahlberg could pull out a performance like that and then go a bit over the top with the monologue speech at the end where he whips his...manhood, for a lack of a better word, out. He showcases the turmoil that the character suffers and feels and shows the irrational actions that he does. He shows that the character is still a child and that he cannot go through the world alone. The character has a lack of moral figures, but he is in the porn industry. John C. Reilly as Reed Rothchild, Dirk Diggler's friend, takes the role and makes it his. He makes the role as cool as Diggler's. He is the second best performance in the film. Julienne Moore is a goddess. She make all the fanboys giggle with excitement when she asked Dirk Diggler to come in inside of her. I mean, that line set off the dirty alarm in all of the fan boys heads, and she gives a excellent performance that only P.T. can draw out of her.

P.T.'s writing and direction have jumped from the Hard Eight days as it got more complex and a lot better than the writing in his earlier films. He makes his characters more richer and develops them more than they were in Hard Eight. I mean, he shows fantastic writing skills in the way the characters think, act, talk and feel. He has also done that in his third film Magnolia. He makes sure that the film seems authentic and it does with P.T.'s obsessions with pornography as a child. The film also has trademarks of him with the long shot at the beginning that introduces all of the characters in a seemingly original way.

Overall, it is one of my favorite movies. It is a solid movie that makes you seem impressed and feel like watching it over and over again. It takes you into a seedy underworld of porn and shows the characters that are in the industry and how they live their every day life.",1178668800,,2607,4.347022587268994

1352177,5,B00004TQF7,"This movie is absolutely amazing. I first saw it nine years ago as a teenage film lover who was interested in movies about the 1970s. I didn't expect to see an earth-shattering masterpiece that ranks among the best movies of the decade, but that's just what I saw. Boogie Nights is only P.T. Anderson's second film, but it's so expertly made you'd swear it was made by a 40-year veteran. Every single frame of this film is full of intoxicating visuals that leave you mesmerized. For example, the opening 3-minute steadicam shot, of which there are many more throughout the film. Every camera move, every camera angle is so beautifully and artfully concieved, you will want to rewind just to admire them again. Boogie Nights has a visceral kinetic energy that ranks it alongside the best of the 1990s with Goodfellas, Pulp Fiction and Se7en.

In addition to the virtuoso direction, the film boasts stunning performances from its huge cast. Burt Reynolds, Mark Wahlberg, Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, John C. Reilly: many of today's best actors are all here in one place, at the top of their game. It's not all fun and hijinks, though. The movie goes from light-hearted to dead serious at the drop of a hat. The many characters are all incredibly well developed, and you will grow to love them by the time the movie's over. There's also the excellent soundtrack. Typically you hear all the same predictable songs in movies that are set in the '70s. However, P.T. Anderson's soundtrack is very unique and always unpredictable. The tunes are used to great effect, and are very memorable.

Boogie Nights should be required viewing for every film lover. See it and learn what a brilliant director can really accomplish with a modest budget, a huge cast of great actors, and a great screenplay. It is one of the most exhilirating, enlightening, moving motion pictures I have ever seen. A masterpiece.",1174435200,,1921,4.853658536585366
1352178,5,B00004TQF7,"I just watched my videotape of `Boogie Nights' again. There were so many familiar faces that the real deal for me was appreciating the movie as a slice of hyper reality. The biggest irony this time was the ""safe in the bedroom"" phrase near the end of the movie. There are a few times when violence becomes an issue, and people tend to get shot in threes in `Boogie Nights.' When one character pulls out a gun and anounces to his buddies that they aren't going anywhere until they get what is in the safe in the bedroom, the main question for the viewer is likely to be, `Who is going to end up dead this time?' Having fire crackers going off in the house at that point seems to add to the absurdity: how could anyone live that way?

Some great songs can be heard playing, and the rich guy with a safe in the bedroom is one of the biggest appreciators of the music in this movie. I can't recall any songs by Tom Petty, but the transition from the 1970s to the 1980s in `Boogie Nights' reminds me of the song on the `Southern Accents' (1985) CD about a man with a dog collar on. ""Hey, Spike, what do you like?"" Tom Petty liked to ask questions that can go a little deeper than what the early part of this movie was trying to get at, and then hint: ""Maybe we can help him see, the future ain't what it used to be."" Julianne Moore has a great crying scene to sum up how she reacts to having a judge ask her some highly personal questions about getting busted. The system works by applying its own standards to people, and a major character is shown in jail or prison, maybe both, by the end of the movie.",1173398400,,1600,4.161290322580645

Mark Wahlberg stars as Eddie Adams, a [..]bus boy working at a nightclub washing dishes.  One of the club's most frequent visitors is Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds), a porn movie producer who comes to the club looking for new actors.  Rollergirl (Heather Graham) also works at the club and is one of Horner's most popular actresses.

One night, Jack goes into the back to talk to Eddie and soon the two become friends.  Jack tells Eddie all about the porn business, and Eddie is immediately intrigued.

For several years, Dirk is living in the limelight, making lots of money, and filming lots of x-rated movies.  However, success begins to take its toll, and Dirk delves into the world of drugs and alcohol.  Dirk's hard-driving life catches up to him and he has a major falling-out with Jack, who has replaced him with a new main actor called Johnny Doe.

1352181,4,B00004TQF7,"'Boogie Nights' does for the disco seventies and the porn industry what 'Nashville' did to country music.  It shows the underside of the glamour presented.  The film shows us all the trappings that draw people to the ""high life,"" then pulls the rug out from under it.  We see the usual suspects and the usual draws:  There's money, fame, lust, passion, and drugs.  But these benefits provide an understated banality that comes to the fore.  The seemingly long, drawn out conversations are only postcards of emotion that show the depth of personhood that seems to escape all of the protagonists.  It is superficial, and all of life's best elements seem to go out the window.

There is the calculated cheesiness of the producer (Burt Reynolds) and his odd detatchment from his craft.  He both revels and drowns in the lust and money that are presented to him.  He meets a young aspiring hopeful (Mark Wallberg) who must overcome his poverty and alienation from home.  His naivete' is striking, and he doesn't entirely change in his innocence, only becoming a casualty of it.  (The way he practices to become the next Bruce Lee in the midst of his success as a novelty presentation is certainly a sad commentary about his life.)  His new success doesn't make him all that happy, including his rationalization that his movies are making marriages more passionate.  The aftermath of all the calculated lust makes everyone, except the calloused producer, a casualty in a different way.  One fellow porn star (Don Cheadle) demonstrates that his true passion is for a loving marriage and a hi-fi business, but the decent, conventional world won't let him.  Similarly, a fellow porn creator (William Macy) shows tragically that love transcends lust, even when it won't ever become realized.  A female porn star is devastated by her cocaine addiction and an inevitable result of a custody battle.  If we aren't convinced near the end of the movie, then a ""candid camera"" scene between ""Rollergirl"" and the man off the street certainly shows how the emotional baggage catches up to all of the porn industry's false promises for true happiness.

The initial draw to 'Boogie Nights' may be deceptive.  It presents the glamour of all that the modern world believes to be desirable, but cleverly shows how the lowest common denominator can restrict our lives from even greater happiness.",1160179200,,2372,4.941919191919192

1352184,5,B00004TQF7,"Given that pornography is a multi-jillion-dollar-a-year business, it's sort of surprising that it hasn't received the cinematic treatment more often, but Boogie Nights provides it with the sort of skewed, darkly comic treatment that it almost certainly deserves, and becomes a certifiable classic in the process.  Following the story of Eddie Adams, a simple-minded, almost impossibly well-endowed teenager from suburban California who achieves porn stardom as Dirk Diggler before turning 20, Boogie Nights is both a time-tested star-is-born-and-almost-blows-it-all story and a loving tribute to a time and place that will probably never be replicated and the individuals who made it what it was.

Paul Thomas Anderson's directing is as excessive and stylish as you'd expect from a movie centered on the porno industry, with Anderson pulling out every trick in the book--long tracking shots, underwater closeups, montages, movie-within-a-movie views, and some moments that approach stream-of-consciousness (Dirk's vision of his professional name literally exploding off a neon sign being a prominent example).  Naturally, Anderson also loads the movie up with period details, right down to the Farah Fawcett poster in teenage Dirk's room, the platform shoes, and the obligatory disco sequences.  Its visual flair aside, though, Boogie Nights is also the sort of insanely quotable, watch-it-until-you've-memorized-it movie that seemed to come out in droves in the nineties (Trainspotting, Fargo, Goodfellas, Swingers, True Romance, etc. etc. etc.) but has been in disturbingly short supply this decade.  This movie simply seems to have everything you can think of going for it, especially its murderer's row of a cast--Burt Reynolds (Jack Horner), Don Cheadle (Buck Swope), John C. Reilly (Reed Rothchild), Julianne Moore (Amber Waves), William H. Macy (Little Bill), Luis Guzman (Maurice Rodriguez), Tom Jane (Todd Parker), Philip Baker Hall (Floyd Gondolli), Philip Seymour Hoffman (Scotty Jay), and Alfred Molina (Rahad Jackson) all figure prominently--and even Wahlberg (Dirk himself) and Heather Graham (Rollergirl) have roles that are perfectly suited to their relative limitations as actors.

That said, what really gives the movie its resonance is the obvious sympathy with which it treats its characters, who are generally easy to laugh at but equally easy to like.  The main characters almost entirely have hopes, aspirations, and attachments beyond the rather closed world of their profession--Jack's desire to be a serious filmmaker; Dirk's ridiculous pseudo-Karate and Reed's equally ridiculous poetry; Buck's goal of opening his own stereo store; Amber's attempts to get back in touch with her son, which she blatantly compensates for by mothering her co-stars--helping us see them as fleshed-out characters, not just plot devices in the story.

Since there isn't really a plot to speak of, the movie is told as a series of episodes, Goodfellas-style, with several extended pieces--the pool party at Jack's House where Eddie/Dirk gets introduced to the whole crew; the New Year's Eve party celebrating the start of the '80's; the fake drug deal gone bad at a Rahad's house--serving to turn the narrative in new directions.  This last set piece--when Dirk, Reed, and Todd head over to Rahad's house to sell him some baking soda disguised as cocaine and it quickly degenerates into a laughably misguided robbery attempt--deserves special mention, as it's easily one of the most fascinating single scenes in recent film memory.  It starts off almost surreal, with a skinny Chinese guy walking around randomly lighting firecrackers and Rahad (clad only in underwear, a bathrobe and slippers) discoursing semi-coherently as he sings along to not-so-classic 80's songs on a mixtape.  From there it just gets progressively darker and tenser, with the lighting, acting, and direction all perfectly serving to ratchet up the feeling of desperation and horror as Todd kicks his ill-conceived robbery plot into motion and things spin way out of control.  Molina's over-the-top performance, more than anything else, makes the scene, as he turns Rahad into a manic ball of drug-fuelled energy and, later, a shotgun-toting avenging angel determined to take his revenge.  I wouldn't say Molina turns in the best performance I've ever seen in a movie, but it it probably the best performance I've seen from someone who only got one scene in the whole movie.

The '80's are, of course, the hangover from the joys of the previous decade, as the emergence of video downgrades the quality of the product, cocaine suddenly becomes addictive, and Dirk starts to become too big for his britches in more ways than one.  Fittingly, as the disco era gives way to tougher times in the eighties, the movie takes a darker turn, becoming grittier, more downcast and a lot more violent, but no less compelling.  All the unbridled energy and creativity of the first half is still present, just in a decidedly less sunny form.  Even when people are getting beaten up and shot left and right, the movie's pedal-to-the-metal pacing makes it all but impossible to look away.  Well, except maybe for the notorious money shot at the end, but by then I for one didn't care.",1155340800,,5247,5.347087378640777
1352185,2,B00004TQF7,"The setting of this film is in the late 70s, just before adult movie theatres were driven out of business by the invention of the VCR and the subsequent explosion of pornographic VHS tapes.  Burt Reynolds plays a porno director who has the effrontry to try and be ""artistic"" in his craft.  Heather Graham plays his psycho-starlet, and Mark Wahlberg plays a porn star who is....well.....let's just say, endowed.

Wahlberg's character quickly becomes a huge hit and encounters success he would have never dreamed of. Wahlberg's character seems to be a sort of oblique allusion to John Holmes, although I don't know if the film-makers would admit as much.  At any rate, he becomes arrogant and begins to believe that he is loved for factors other than his ""package.""  This hubris leads to his un-doing as the world of porn coalesces with the world of drugs and LOTS of shady characters.

This sounds like it would be the framework for a good movie.  Well, it could have been, but all the way through there seems to be something missing.  There are times the film ""seems"" to try and convey a message, but I'm not really sure.

One thing I do know is that I quickly remembered why I've never cared for Wahlberg.  He has all the screen presence of a bowl of yogurt.  Also, I was expecting a LOT more skin than what the film delivered.  Given the context of the film, one would think that it would be an excuse to parade miles of topless women.  That's simply not the case.

In the end, however, the biggest problem of this movie isn't Wahlberg or the lack of nudity.  The difficulty is that it's just plain boring.  I have more than a passing interest in the history of porn, and yet this flick failed to grab me.",1153180800,,1707,4.511400651465798

Burt Reynolds is back at the top of his game in years, Marky Mark can act(Dirk himself), Heather Graham, and all the rest are in top form.

1352187,5,B00004TQF7,"I was very impressed with this story. I saw it in the theater, and also have this version on DVD.  This is one of the most intense, longest, fulfilling movies available on the topic of the pornography industry in the 70's and 80's.  Very stylistic and (un)believable.  A (c)ockumentary of superior proportions.  But it wasn't really a documentary, just a Hollywood movie, based on a time, when porn was coveted by the raincoat crowd.

When I say (un)believable, I mean the story truely is unbelievable, in that the porn industry is not a man actor's world, but clearly belongs to the female actor.  She is the star in this industry.  So, when I see a movie like this, I worry for the young men out there, who think that they are the next ""Dirk Diggler.""

While, I'm probably over worrying the concept, I still hope that my words reach some man out there.  This is not reality.  This is a fantasy, conceptualized by a Hollywood Director; and nothing more.

In reality, this could have easily been a story written about a female actress, such as Rollergirl?  Interesting enough, the director fell into the cliche, making Rollergirl, a victim.  Chastised by her Highschool classmates, and ran out of school.  But in reality, we in the know, know that it is the Jenna Jameson's and Tera Patrick's who are the real starts.

I give this one 5 stars though, as it really is an over the top effort by the director.  I was quite impressed.

1352189,4,B00004TQF7,"Boogie Nights is one of those films, in the vein of Blow, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Requiem for a Dream, that stares unflinchingly at something ugly and asks us to follow along without blinking.  When it's the porn industry, it's hard not to blink.

It's the swinging 70s, and porn is on the rise.  Eddie Adams AKA Dirk Diggler (Mark Wahlberg), is a fresh-faced lad with a particular gift.  That gift happens to be in his pants.  His reputation is well known, but it's only when porn director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) discovers him that Dirk's career takes off.  And thus begins a bizarre journey into the seedier side of filmmaking, complete with diva-level antics, arguments about video technology, and lots of sex and drugs.

What's alternately curious and interesting about the film is that this is a traditional rag to riches story, only it happens to involve porn.  Dirk is portrayed as having a natural talent, a trait every character observes with deadly seriousness.  His talent, and the dedication to his ""art,"" elevates the entire porn industry itself, from merely badly filmed shaky-cam sex films to dramas with plot and character development.  Well, what passes for character development in porn, anyway.

There's Amber Waves (Julianne Moore), a porn queen barred from seeing her own children and subsequently mother to everybody. Reed Rothschild (John C. Reilly) is Dirk's right-hand man and frequent co-star.  Rollergirl (Heather Graham in her best acting role yet), does it with her roller skates on.  All the time.  Buck Swope (Don Cheadle) is a black porn star that wants to live the American dream of owning his own business.  And finally, we have Little Bill (William H. Macy), assistant director to Horner and married to a utterly hedonistic woman who does it with everyone, everywhere, at any time.

By the time we get to the 80s, several characters are dead, video is king, and Dirk is too hopped up on drugs to notice that it's affecting his performance.  A falling out with Horner leads Dirk to strike out on his own, trying to be anything but a porn star.  Unfortunately, Dirk's only good at one thing. And it takes him most of the movie to figure out what that is.

Horner, Waves, and Dirk creates their own twisted, happy family.  Incapable of living in society separately due to the stigma of what they do, they form a kinship that only they can share.  And even they have their own bonds and boundaries; to their work, to themselves, to each other.  Those that cannot define who they are end up dead or in prison, or worse.

In the end, Boogie Nights is about making good with what you've got.  And yes that means even porn stars sometimes have to face facts: sometimes you're best talent is having sex on camera. The question becomes what a 17-year-old kid turned porn star is supposed to do about it.  Boogie Nights answers it in the final scene, when the true star of the film is unzipped to stare us in the face.",1149379200,,2955,4.702334630350195

Anderson rips off Martin Scorcese at every turn, and the story moves at a snail's pace.  I felt no sympathy/empathy for any of the characters.  This movie is based on scumbag John Holmes, and anybody that knows the truth about him should be seething at the fact that a movie has been made glorifiying his life. Finally, this film is just plain boring.  I rented this movie with the highest expectations, but an hour into it, I was watching the timer on the VCR wondering when this abomination of film making was going to end.  This is the worst film I've ever seen.  Sure, the acting and production values in 'Plan 9 From Outerspace' are infamous, but 'Boogie Nights' left me angry.",1146873600,,857,4.525974025974026
1352192,5,B00004TQF7,"There are certain taboos a director doesn't dare touch when he wants to become a ""respected filmmaker"". In my opinion, it takes a truly gifted director to incorporate such themes in their work while still keeping widely acknowledged critical credibility. For instance, Stanley Kubrick was a master at this. He touched on subjects as pedophilia, rape, and even the horror genre, and he never lost an ounce of brilliance nor credibility. Coming off his modest, low-key debut Hard Eight, Paul Thomas Anderson made an extremely bold decision on the subject matter of his follow-up: the adult film industry.

There is a certain indefinable mastery that seemed to flow through the veins of young directors in the 1970s. Films like The Godfather, Chinatown, and Apocalypse Now had it on rampant display. Anderson is one of the very few modern filmmakers with this mastery within him.

Boogie Nights opens with an explosion of color and sound as the camera glides through a bustling street of `70s nightlife with liquid ease. We are introduced to the cast one by one in a nightclub before finally arriving at a young busboy (Wahlberg). Adult film tycoon Jackie Treehorne (Reynolds) spots him and immediately knows he is something special. He is correct, as this busboy is endowed with an enormous ""talent"", if you will. Treehorne takes him under his wing and nurtures him into the biggest thing in the industry (no pun intended).

Never before has a modern film encapsulated the spirit, fashion, and sound of the 1970s as well as Boogie Nights. The soundtrack is incessantly infectious, the sets and wardrobe vibrant, and even the cinematography is lush and colorful.

The 1980s start off with the bang of a suicide on midnight of January 1st. Thus begins the fall of class and decency (if that's what you want to call it) in the porn industry. I would say that the early half of this decade is nothing but drugs, sex, and debauchery, but those were the `70s. Those were the good times. No, the `80s are filled with violence, serious drug addiction, despair, and the general fall of the mighty.

As I have said, Boogie Nights is a fantastic sensory experience. However, its real strengths lie in its characters. It may sound odd to hear Boogie Nights described as an epic, but it really is. In a lot of ways, it's a modern Gone With The Wind. It doesn't make itself big through massive sets and thousands of extras, but through the journey it takes us through with the characters over the span of two decades: the rise, the top, the fall, the bottom, and the triumphant return.

And Anderson orchestrates it all with a presence, ease, confidence, and mastery atypical of a director on his second film. The music is perfect. The visuals are perfect. The acting is perfect. The editing is perfect. The writing is perfect. The direction is perfect. Anderson makes his cinematic influences subtle yet apparent, and even his obvious influence Martin Scorsese could not have pulled this film off as impeccably as he.

It would have been easy for a filmmaker to turn Boogie Nights into a parody of the pornography industry. After all, it's not exactly held in high regard. But Anderson crafts a loving portrait of these characters, and the audience likes and cares about them just as much as he does. Boogie Nights is a funny, depressing, uplifting, exciting, heartbreaking, and strangely beautiful film. It truly is a masterpiece in every sense of the word.",1146700800,,3443,4.845238095238095
1352193,5,B00004TQF7,"Boogie Nights is simply one of the greatest film making achievements of all time. There are so many awe-inspiring elements to this movie it's difficult to know where to start. The acting is absolutely outstanding led by Burt Reynolds who gives the performance of a lifetime. Burt deserved his Oscar nomination and should have taken home the trophy. His calculated and nuanced performance is a joy to behold. But the rest of the cast is just as stellar and could be the most talent ever put together in one movie.  Many of these talented actors may have not been as well known at the time the movie was made but are now recognized as among the best in the industry. Julianne Moore, Don Cheadle, John C. Reilly, Mark Wahlberg, Heather Graham, William H. Macy and this years Best Actor Oscar winner Philip Seymour Hoffman are among the finest and hottest actors today and they bring to life a cast of characters that is unforgettable. In addition to this incredible all star line up the film features a wonderful array of bit players who each shine during their brief time on the screen.

The story keeps you on the edge of your seat at all times because you have no idea what is going to happen next.  Boogie Nights has more twist and turns than a roller coaster and is just as thrilling. And with all of the serious drama and action the film is loaded with hilariously funny moments along the way that endear these characters to the audience, faults and all.  Anyone who doesn't see this magnificent film because they think it is just about the porn industry will be depriving themselves of one of the most exhilarating, enjoyable and satisfying motion pictures they will ever experience.

The other major star of the movie is the magical musical soundtrack that has obviously been meticulously selected and each song is placed not only in the perfect scene but comes in at the exact right moment.  The songs and their placement in the film are phenomenal and take you right back to the 70's and set the mood perfectly.

Paul Thomas Anderson has created a masterpiece that is a must have for any DVD collection.  You can and will watch this movie over and over and over again, love it more each time and discover something new each time.  This movie has found a place in my heart and a spot in my top ten of all time.",1144627200,,2316,4.534772182254197

1352195,5,B00004TQF7,"I am simply writing to say I disagree with the comments that brand the Burt Reynolds character as a ""Mephistopheles.""  In my opinion this movie is largely about family.  Burt's character is the patriarch of a family by election, with Juliane Moore as the mother, Dirk as the favored (and prodigal) son (rejected by his own mom), Rollergirl as the daughter, etc.  Notice the scene in which Rollergirl and Moore basically make this connection, and notice that while they are all a family everything is OK, but it is when they break up that things turn sour.  A substory about a porn star trying to leave the business to become an enterpeneur with his new, preganant wife in my opinion only highlights the importance of family.  Even in the middle of this sleazy business a family is more or less created and works to some degree.  Remember the end of PTA's Magnolia where all the families overcome their bondage and find grace and forgiveness.  Or the surrogate family in Hard Eight....",1142899200,,984,4.719298245614035
1352196,5,B00004TQF7,"Mired in the late 1970s world where porn was making the transition from film to video, Boogie Nights features a cast of unctuous entrepreneurs, sharks, self-promoters, charlatans, and , yes, the notorious Dirk Diggler, a porn star whose naive version of the American Dream, like Jay Gatsby's, does not have a moral foundation and must, inevitably, come tumbling down. ""Adopting"" disaffected, adolescent misfits into his home and enticing them with money, Jack Hoerner, played by Burt Reynolds, is the film's Mephistopholes. Diggler's trajectory is predictable but the humor and pathos is effective as Paul Thomas Anderson captures the 1970s and 1980s zeitgeist well--the sartorial disasters, the cliches, the kitsch. It's all here.

One of the underlying themes of this dark comedy is the American appetite for success without any moral compass. For a couple of companion pieces that will shed much light on Boogie Nights' theme, I recommend The Hunger for More by Laurence Shames, specifically his chapter ""The More Factor,"" and the essay (should be available online) by Joseph Epstein titled ""The Perpetual Adolescent.""",1142726400,,1121,5.405714285714286

1352199,5,B00004TQF7,"In my more impressionable days. I saw this movie on the big screen and was blown away by the fictionalized account of larger than life (and larger in the pants) porn star John Holmes.  Now, having learned more of the backstory, I know that this account is more Hollywood big-screen fun that it is true to the depressing Holmes story.  For something that harkens a little closer to the truth, try 2003's Wonderland or Legs McNeil's The Other Hollywood.  That being said, this is still a great story, albeit one that has a far happier ending than the truth.  It makes for compelling watching, I'll tell ya!

To recount the plot as briefly as possible, we've got busboy Eddie Adams rising to the top of the world as porn star Dirk Diggler and then falling into drug use and desperation.  It's much more than that, however.  Wahlberg as Diggler is excellent as a self-obsessed, vacant, male star who thinks very highly of himself.  One of the highlights of the movie is Diggler's attempt at a musical career, singing overblown quintessential 80's ballads (since Wahlberg actually had a moderately successful career of his own, portraying the screeching singer is admirable).  The rest of the cast really make the movie--Julianne Moore as the mothering porn star Amber Waves, Burt Reynolds as the director, and Don Cheadle in the sleeper role as confused actor Buck, who changes images (from cowboy to gospel singer and on) with every changing year, but never manages to fit in.  We also get to see Heather Graham naked in one of her breakout roles.  Don't miss Rollergirl in this film.

So, the latest release brings some DVD extras.  Are they worth it?  The John C Reilly files are a few scenes that are only for the most hardcore fans.  Everyone else will understand why the ended up on the cutting room floor.  The deleted scenes on the bonus DVD develop some of the minor characters better--the viewer gets more insight into William H. Macy's cuckold character, Buck's business plans, further footage from Amber's documentary, Maurice's attempt at a porn scene (worth it alone!!), and some additional drug-fueled scenes with Dirk.  Also included is a blooper reel (presented as a deleted scene) of one of the Brock movies in which Brock is visiting Maurice's bar, trying to get information.  This is a real winner of a bonus scene, just for the on-set laughs between two talented actors.

As other reviewers have said, I do balk at the high price for just a few bonus items, but Amazon seems to have seriously discounted the disc these days, so if you get it on sale, it is totally worth it.",1136764800,,2591,4.7305122494432075
1352200,2,B00004TQF7,"I was looking at several Burt Reynolds movies, ""Hooper"" and ""Semi-Tough"" for a pair, and also the brilliant ""Deliverance"" in which he really shows his talent.

The Amazon reviews for these films all referred to ""Boogie Nights"" which I had not seen, (no agenda, here) so I rented it. The reviews for BN, which are closing in on 300, all seem to speak to the extraordinarily gifted (I swear, no double entendre here) plot, story line, and acting.

WOW. Julianne Moore and Heather Graham really do look great unencumbered by all those silly clothes. I never noticed how great those actors were until they got naked. Especially doing some of this stuff on roller skates! That's acting! So here's my point.

What's the big deal? I mean there are some 'Gone With the Wind' 'Citizen Kane' reviews out there. This is a movie about pornography, or if that's too Republican a phrase for you, people who are filmed while having sex. Now, I'm not about to use the adjective ""normal"" because that's one of those words from where there is no safe return. It's like those war movies where the heroes are told in the first few frames 'it's a one-way mission.'

But I will add that while I venture back to my initial comment, it's fun to look at naked women, golly, don't you think it tends to debase women? Don't you think that while we are rationalizing the excesses of the 70's we ought to consider that the explosion of porn might not have been something we want to laud? Maybe, just maybe THE GUYS on the Supreme Court went just a little too far? That a lot of these girls were just that, girls, under the age of 18? That even if they were just young, a lot of them were blitzed? How about this? In the days of the Pussycat theaters, do you think it meant anything that 99.5% of the audience were men?

Gee. I must be missing something (seriously). I mean I don't like Reverand Pat. He's an idiot. I don't feel I have any moral high ground to speak from. I struggle along with everyone else. But I thought it was an incredibly stupid movie. I gave it 2 stars, yeah, because of Moore and Graham, because I'm a real fan of Luis Guzman, and Macy and Cheadle are always great, and Burt, who keeps breaking my heart by making junk. 2 stars.

There are some parts of the 70's we collectively ought to forget. OK. I'll accept Disco. But Porn? No. I don't believe we should censor it. Maybe we should stop trying to sell it, though. Larry Scantlebury",1136764800,,2430,4.425055928411633
1352201,5,B00004TQF7,"There are a few things that I want to state upfront:

1. I love the film

2. The DVD EXTRAS are not worth paying extra for

3. The basic plot of a male porn star is totally fiction

I remember reading an article on the porn industry.  In straight porn, the women are the stars.  Men are there as dressing and to make the fantasy of the viewers come to life.  In the 70's there was only one real male porn star - John Holmes and he was really just an average looking guy.  Remember that this film takes place in late 70's before the video boom.  To see these films you went to the Pussycat Theaters, which are pretty sleazy. The audience was men, so they wanted a man on the screen that they could relate to - an average, ordinary guy next door.

If you were a good looking, well built male in the porn industry and you wanted to make money you went into gay porn not straight porn.

With that said, I still think this is a great film.  You have to understand what I just stated to understand that this is a fairy tale.  Yes, a fairy tale but an ugly fairy tale.  Other than the above fantasy, this film accurately depicts the adult film industry.

Burt Reynolds plays an adult film producer / director.  He is with his number one star Amber Waves (Julianne Moore).  He is constantly looking for new talent.  One night he discovers a bus boy, Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg).  He lures the kid into his web.  Eddie becomes an overnight sensation as his alter ego, Dirk Diggler.  Dirk succumbs to his own success which leads to a life on the edge including drug addiction.  When his reign as king is over, his life spirals into a free fall.  But this is a fairy tale, so Dirk pulls his life together and stages a comeback.

This film has a wonderful supporting cast.  A wild assortment of colorful characters played by some of the best, and at that time unknown, character actors including Don Cheadle, John C Reilly, Heather Graham and Philip Seymour Hoffman.

WARNING: As you might guess, there is excessive nudity and drug use in the film.

Try music video - Michael Penn music video - has director's commentary (3 minutes)

Cast and Crew Bios - The cast members each have just a filmography but their characters each have their own detailed biography and selected filmography!

1352203,2,B00004TQF7,"I think the writer/director of BOOGIE NIGHTS was born in the 1970s, which doesn't necessarily disqualify him for doing a film set in the 70s--he certainly captures tons of details of that much-maligned era--but this long and indulgent film suffers from too many derivatives from other films and a wrong-headed approach to an industry that wasn't so kind to its denizens.

Mark Walberg is actually pretty good as Dirk Diggler, mostly because he's good at looking vapid and empty like a talentless porn star (the cutting of their ""hit record"" is hilarious).  Burt Reynolds got a lot of critical acclaim--but he really should be doing various roles like this: Burt is great when he wants to be.  And Heather Graham looks great naked (not the first time I've written that in a review).

As great as the cast was (like Julianne Moore and Don Cheadle), the characters lack focus and hardly garner any sympathy.  If you know anything about the real porn stars and their disturbing lives, you actually end up thinking they're all getting off pretty light.

But BOOGIE NIGHTS is such a Scorsese rip-off that it's distracting.  The long tracking shot introducing the characters and their world might have been forgivable...but that's just the first of many ""homages"" to Scorcese.  Mostly from GOODFELLAS, but the final scene is straight out of RAGING BULL.  After a while, it just felt like a lack of maturity.  Or that Anderson is still looking for his own voice.

I got the whole ""porn as family"" theme...but the corrosive truth of the 70s porn industry is much darker and cost the participants far more.  Call it family values--if HBO and MTV established the values.

Despite movies like BOOGIE NIGHTS and WONDERLAND, the John Holmes story has yet to be really told (although WONDERLAND plunged a little deeper into the mire), and the PBS Frontline special about a porn starlet who killed herself was more shocking and dramatic than BOOGIE NIGHTS--and it didn't feature any nudity.

But the music was good.  Lots of wood paneling, so it looked authentic.  I even had one of those horribly-uncomfortable shirts with the dirt bike on it when I was a kid.

""17"" he replied with an innocent boyish expression on his face and i couldn't stop laughing. mark is as 17 as i am a britney spears look alike. But so what he plays the part well, and this was such a good movie only because of (not the porn) but the cast. And i gotta say this. Juliane Moore is absolutely gorgeous in boogie nights. That gorgeous red hair and exotic eyes, and that voice that she has that can make anyone melt, and not to mention her freckles, and oh the best part - her naked! That is the best scene in the whole movie. I don't like big big big chests, hers are perfect. And it's so funny because ever since she met dirk, you could tell by the look on her face that she wanted to rip off his clothes from the very beginning when she first met him. She is such a talented actress and has been in unfortunate bad movies such as hannibal and the forgotton. She was too good for those bad movies, but as far as boogie nights she was my favorite. Not to mention her loud moan during the first scene with dirk. This movie is so believable and very funny at times. It's a drama, but you can tell it was meant to be a comedy also. Am i the only one who thinks mark's very last scene when he showed his special piece of equipment that is humungously large....... is fake? I asked my brother's opinion and he said what do you think? It looked fake to me, because it was limp and not fully erected, and it still was way too big. I'd like to know for sure if it was fake or not. If he did have a huge you know what, why would he show it off in a movie? And if he was picked for the part for his you know what, and not his acting, that would make no sense because you have to be able to act, and the whole movie throughout they kept referring to his large wang.

1352209,5,B00004TQF7,"One tends to think of adult entertainment as a bastion of scumbags and perverts, but Boogie Nights presents a loving glimpse of the unacknowledged human face behind it all. It's a fun film, no doubt, but its morality play on human frailties is heartwarming.

The tail end of the 70s saw a small cadre of porn directors who honestly believed they could combine realistic raunch with an engaging plot. Lofty goal, and one that sure enough proved impossible to realize, with VHS forcing movies to be made cheaper and faster.

Boogie Nights chronicles the quick rise and demise of this so-called ""artistic porn"" business and the unusual people who participated in it.

To the extent that the film is a reflection of reality, its strengths lie not in its accuracy but in its warmth in relaying the hopes and dreams within this makeshift family.

As we follow a regular well-endowed Joe's rise to (and inevitable fall from) stardom, a handful of subplots seep in -- the allure of stardom and the price some are willing to pay to attain it, the difficulty of rehabilitating after one's name has been tainted by association with porn, the compelling urge to belong.

There's much to be seen, literally. Thankfully genuine comedy lurks in the crevices. Characters are well-sketched, and we feel for most of them. Clocking just over 2.5 hours the film is not for the faint of heart, but the sheer vitality of bravura performances keeps us spellbound.

A word for the energetic camerawork. The movie opens with a five-minute unbroken crane shot that swirls around the streets of LA, then enters a club and circles the dance floor introducing us to almost every major character. This fabulous shot sets the standard for the rest of the film, a delight for anyone interested in this sort of thing.

This movie is worthy of an Oscar in my opinion. I feel it is way underrated due to its topic. The film is based on John Holmes, The legendary adult film star. When I say based I mean just that, its not a biopic, its just very similar to his life. In fact, there are actual lines that Holmes has said in movies and interviews throughout the film. What I really like about this movie is the feeling I get afterwards, like I really knew the characters. They each have such great personalities, you tend to forget they are the actors portraying these people. Mark Wahlberg is superb in the role of Dirk Diggler. Like John Holmes, his claim to fame was his endowment. The mystery of his said endowment is finally revealed at the end of the flick. The atmosphere of the movie is very authentic. The soundtrack is awesome. There is a lot of drama, comedy, satire and sadness sprinkled all through this movie. An emotional rollercoaster that rides smoothly. Its a long movie, but considering the original screenplay was 300 pages long and called for a 5 hour epic, its not too bad. I can not recommend this movie enough. If you are not one for nudity and are against the porn industry, this movie is definitely not for you. There are also a few violent scenes, one of which is quite graphic.

1352211,5,B00004TQF7,"The first time I saw Director/Writer, Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Boogie Nights"", I was just totally bowled over by the sights & sounds and bold scope of this brilliant comedy/drama. Against the vast tapestry of the late 1970's/early '80s, he gives a 'behind-the-scenes' tour of the porn movie industry and at the same time shows a number of intimate, personal portraits of the people, who make up this world. The film begins in the late 1970's, where we meet Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg) in a glitzy, disco night club. Eddie is a lowly dishwasher, who has been thrown out of his house by his own mother (Joanna Gleason) for being ""such a loser"". But Eddie has a mantra ""that everyone has something, that makes them special"". Indeed Eddie is ""special"", because he has been blessed with a sexual appendage of enormously huge proportions. He is discovered by porn movie director, Jack Horner (a wonderful Burt Reynolds) who like a proud father, presides over a large stock company of both actors and technical people, who form an almost make-shift 'family' of sorts. We watch as in an almost ""Alice in Wonderland"" fashion, Eddie is introduced and soon becomes a major star (under the neon name, Dirk Diggler!) in the world of the 1970's movie porn. The film shows how Dirk,(as he is now known) and his friends & co-workers get caught up in the hard partying life-style of the ""Me Decade"". As the decade rolls over and the '80s begin, a price eventually is paid. The industry experiences major changes and the excesses of cocaine, sex and even violence leads to dark, ominous places in the lives of many of these people. We watch as the characters eventually get on with their lives (marriages, children, new careers ETC.) for both good & bad. Paul Thomas Anderson has created a marvelous film! He portrays a short but significant time in the '70s, when porn filmmakers actually had pretensions to make 'artistic' movies (bigger budgets, actual stories). He shows us how these pretensions went to the way side with the introduction of the home video recorder and the huge amounts of money that could be made with cheaply made videos. It's ironic, that against this background, Anderson presents us a script (with well drawn characters), that gives a number of personal stories of people trying to secure their lives by making a family. The casting and performances in this movie are spectacular! It resucitated the moribund career of veteran actor/sex symbol, Burt Reynolds and made stars out of fine actors like Julianne Moore, John C. Reilly, Don Cheadle, William H. Macy, Mark Wahlberg ETC. What a cast! I particularly love the amazing performance from Julianne Moore as the ""mothering"" porn actress, Amber Waves. Finally,I also wish to mention the wonderful soundtract to this movie, which uses a vast array of '70s/'80s pop, rock and disco music to not only set the time period, but also to help propel the emotions and actions of the film. Who can forget the use of Eric Anderson & War's ""Spill the Wine"" at Jack Horner's wild swim party or the whimsical use of Melanie's ""Brand New Key"" during the 'on the couch' audition between Dirk and Rollergirl? Of course the most unforgettable use of music in the movie are'80's anthems, ""Sister Christian"" & ""Jessie's Girl"" which are ironically played in the film's climax, when Dirk and his friends get caught up in a horribly botched robbery of a crazed drug dealer's home. You have to see and hear it, to believe it! ""Boogie Nights"" has now been released in a remastered DVD 'Platinum Special Edition'. The picture and sound are crystal clear!  There are two commentary tracks, that feature PT Anderson and a variety of the film's actors. The disc is also chock full of deleted scenes, that should please any ""Boogie Nights"" fan. This is just a vast, sprawling, wonderfully moving film, that should be in any film fanatic's DVD collection! Highly recommended!",1117152000,,3902,4.858858858858859

Genre Grade: A+

Final Grade: A

This is a great film from Paul Thomas Anderson (director of Magnolia and Punch Drunk Love). It is about the porn industry, and the causes and effects of taking part in such a career. Anderson knows how to make cool movies, that's for sure. One of the best parts about this movie is the amazing music he chose to appear in the film. If you haven't seen this movie and are a fan of P.T., you must see it. It is about the porn industry - so don't be shocked at some of the subject matter in the movie.

The cast was absolutely perfect for this movie, and despite Mark Wahlberg delibrately acting badly in this movie, I really think he is a great actor and very underrated. Don't believe me? Check out his role in I Heart Huckabee's. Julianne Moore and Burt Reynolds are great too, as well as all of the smaller supporting roles, which include William H. Macy, Heather Graham, Don Cheadle, John C. Reilly, Luis Guzman, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Philip Baker Hall. This movie was nominated for 3 Academy Awards, and Burt Reynolds won a Golden Globe for his role (which is funny considering he turned down the role many times, and after finally agreeing and filming, he publicly disowned the movie calling it his ""worst performance of his career."" Ironically, it's the only role he was ever nominated for an Oscar for...).",1116979200,,1394,4.54183266932271
1352213,5,B00004TQF7,"There are few films that, after being viewed once, can be watched again any random point in the film and still catch your attention. Boogie Nights stands alongside films like The Godfather, Scarface, and The Shawshank Redemption as such. A film where the director has created a pace and flow and style that supports the strong writing and acting that flows within.

To you, the reader, there is no need to review the subject matter of the film. By this point you have, more than likely, already gathered enough information to bring you to this point. With that being said, let me elaborate on just what makes this film so entertaining.

 Director Paul Thomas Anderson has proven to be a somewhat enigmatic entity. This being his second major film, Anderson showed a style and presence as a filmmaker that easily rivaled Quinten Tarentino and Martin Scorsese. His later follow ups where rich in dialog and cinematic flare (Magnolia, Punch Drunk Love) but none have come close to equaling this films solid ensemble structure that plays like part reality series, and part comic/tragedy. This film has a raw, yet polished look that compliments it's satire and grit and doesn't get caught up in itslef to the point that it ever seems self indulgent.

Mark Wahlberg has his work cut out for him in the presence of a great supporting cast that includes Don Cheadle, John C. Reilly, William H. Macy, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Phillip Baker Hall, Julianne Moore, Heather Graham, Melora Waters, Luis Guzman and Burt Reynolds in his comeback version of John Travoltas Vincent Vega. Despite being joined by a cast that delivers extremely engaging performances, Mark Wahlberg manages to hold his own portraying the simple minded, big hearted porn phenom, ""Dirk Diggler"".

Much of the film doesn't seem like a film at times. We get to enter this seedy world of adult films, circa 1978 and we come to find that many of these charecters are likeable individuals and thus we are able to invest ourselves in their plight, their pain and their damaging way of healing. Part of the fun of witnessing this is some of the irony that comes long in seeing people stereotyped as ""shady"" as deep, complex charecters wrapped up in their own worlds of confusion, indecision, and addiction. What many would consider to be their biggest flaw is what they consider normal while their true pains linger deep beneath the surface and it is their ""shady"" circle of friends that they seek for sanctuary.

Each frame of this film is work of art in itself. Any one remotely interested in filmmaking need look no further. Boogie Nights could easily qualify as required viewing for a filmmaking 101 course. On the director commentary, Anderson himself freely confesses that he blatantly ripped off Johathan Demes' ( Silence of the Lambs, Philadelphia) work repeatedly on Boogie Nights. Upon viewing Boogie Nights it won't be evident to anyone other than film geeks who went back and studied the latters' previous work, but be that as it may, Anderson has a solid grip on how to make a movie that is thoroughly entertaining, tragically humerous, and consistantly unnerving in the most, entertaining and subliminal of ways.

Although some may criticize it as a bit long at two and a half hours, it only allows time to help develop the flow of a film that, if you have yet to see, will have you sad to see it end.

Some have also chastized the final scene of the film. One thing to consider in watching this film. THis movie has no conclusive finale'. We step into these peoples lives at one point, and we walk out at another. We know their lives go on beyond when the camera turns off and we almost wish we could continue to see what happens but we are glad to see what we saw.",1116547200,,3733,4.7323076923076925
1352214,5,B00004TQF7,"Boogie Nights is easily one of the best movies of the 90's and one of the best American films of the last 20 years.

Where do I begin ?

How about the cast....Mark Wahlberg was surprisingly effective as the busboy with the ""gift"" who is turned into the porn superstar ""Dirk Diggler"" by porn's top filmmaker, played amazingly well by Burt Reynolds in the best performance of his career.

Reynolds is absolutely perfect, flawless in his role.

Julianne Moore is also excellent as aging porn star ""Amber Waves"", who has drug problems and loses custody of her son, but acts as ""Mother"" to the younger actors, especially Dirk, who she sees as a replacement for the son she no longer has.

Heather Graham is very sexy as usual, but as the film develops, she has moments of true depth as well.

Don Cheadle began to show here why he is one of the better actors out there today.

Other notable performances from the terrific William H. Macy, Luis Guzman, Philip Baker Hall, John C. Reilly, etc..

This is one of the best ensemble casts ever put together.

The soundtrack is also top notch, perfectly conveying the mood and times of the 70's and then into the 80's with seemless transition.

In fact, the soundtrack is so good, it is also a star of the movie.

There are so many memorable scenes, it's hard to list them here, but my favorites are in no particular order, the scene near the end in the drug dealer's house, the entire pool party scene early on when Dirk meets the ""family"", the Julianne Moore-Mark Wahlberg sex scene, which was a well done and rather passionate moment, the scene near the end in the limo with Rollergirl and a former classmate and the subsequent scene in the donut shoppe where Don Cheadle inadvertently gets his start up money for his stereo store.

But my favorite moment in Boogie Nights is at the end, where Jack Horner strolls through his house, his ""family"" now back together and safe, when you know that everything is OK and these characters you fell in love with throughout the previous 2 1/2 hours, have overcome alot of their struggles and are in a good ""place"" again.....together.

This film had tremendous character development, which may be shocking to some who thought it was a ""sex"" movie, there is plenty of sex, don't get me wrong, but you begin to really care about these people and begin to view them as people and not just porn stars.

That is one of the beautiful and challenging aspects to this film, but it is pulled off very well.

A dazzling film masterfully shot by Paul Thomas Anderson in a truly astonishing effort.

Boogie Nights is one of those 5 star films that no movie collection should be without.

1352216,5,B00004TQF7,"This is the kind of movie that gets showered with terms such as ""daring,"" or ""shocking,"" or ""groundbreaking,"" or even ""epic.""  To my mind it is all of these, and also a grand, glorious, ambitious messy blast!  A BLAST!!

If the idea of pornography just doesn't hold ANY allure for you, and you're squeamish about sexual matters, stay away.  Simple as that.  If you're an adult with an open mind, dive in and be prepared to spend the next 2.5 hours totally enraptured.  The movie flies by and you really don't want to stop spending time with these characters.

Basically, the movie revolves around young Eddie Adams (""from Torrance"") played by Mark Wahlberg in the role that made him a credible movie star.  He is unhappy at home and has ambitions of ""being a star.""  He doesn't have much going on upstairs, but he's a nice kid and he also has a rather large endowment.  This gets the attention of Jack Horner, a well-known director (Oscar-nominated Burt Reynolds, better than he has EVER been) of adult films.  Soon, Eddie has changed his name to Dirk Diggler and risen to the top of his profession.

We get to see a bit of the nitty-gritty behind the making of porn...the money, the cheap sets, the casual attitudes about it all.  But the movie is more interested in exploring Jack Horner's ""family.""  He lives and works in a huge, deliciously ""'70s era"" mansion/ranch home.  Sprawling, garishly decorated with a glorious pool, the house is perfect for parties that never seem to end.  There is a core gang of characters moving in and out of  this home, and we get long, leisurely looks into their characters and into the little triumphs and crises that come their way.  Reynolds and his main squeeze, porn star Amber Waves (Julianne Moore) are the parents to this rag-tag group, and it's amazing to watch they way these truly sleezy, messed-up or living-on-the-edge people are kept going and reasonably happy by being part of the Reynolds/Moore family. Dirk Diggler is more or less a son to them...a porn-performing son, true.  Heather Graham as Rollergirl is sorta their daughter, and others include John C. Reilly, Don Cheadle and Melora Walters.  We enjoy these seemingly harmless people, and it's a kick learning something about the world of porn.  It's an amazingly graphic movie, with the frankest language I've ever heard in a ""mainstream"" movie.

As a few years go by, we see that the world of drugs, not sex, is what takes its deepest toll.  Dirk handles fame fine (although he develops quite an ego, captured beautifully in a documentary made by Amber Waves that we get to see parts of), but when drugs come into his system, he is turned inside out.  The advent of video tape is shown taking its toll on porn (""everyone can make their own now"") and not everyone handles the change too well.  Other characters try to go legit, and there's a great scene where Don Cheadle is trying to get a loan to open a stereo store...but the banker won't even look at his paperwork because of what he does for a living.

I could go on and on.  The movie seems long and sprawling, but it is actually tightly controlled and nearly every frame reveals something telling, or refreshing or humorous or touching.  The characters are all richly observed, and splendidly acted.  Almost everyone does the best work of their careers.  Burt Reynolds is a revelation.  Julianne Moore (who has been equally terrific since this) is stunning.  Heather Graham peaked with this film.  Don Cheadle gave us an early glimpse of the greatness to come.  John C. Reilly is absolutely hysterical.  Thomas Jane (in a small role) is a hoot, and Alfred Molina in another small role is frightening and daring.  The list goes on and on.  But Mark Wahlberg's character is so central that he MUST be up to the challenge of holding this all together, and he's up to the task.  Particularly early on, he's so immensely likable that it makes us ""like"" the world he is entering.  We root for him to become a porn star!  As he begins to struggle with drugs, money and ego, Wahlberg's characterization grows deeper.  Wahlberg lacked a little polish at this point, perhaps, but he's never been more ""real"" or more in tune with this character.  He hadn't developed too many ""actor's tics"" yet.

I HIGHLY recommend this movie...it's one of my favorites of all time.  Director/writer Paul Thomas Anderson did equally ambitions work in his subsequent MAGNOLIAS (a movie I like very much too) but he really hasn't come close to the home run of BOOGIE NIGHTS.",1107302400,,4512,4.700255102040816

Just look at the cast of this film, and imagine trying to come up with the money to pay them all in a sequel. Andersen's terrific film chronicles the porn industry of the late 1970s - Reynolds and his small, committed troupe have a dysfunctional family atmosphere about them. They are deeply committed to their art form, and the accompanying swinger lifestyle. As much as the film focuses on the rise and fall of proclaimed porn superstar Dirk Diggler [Wahlberg], the film seems to me to be more about the end of an industry - which is sad, even if the industry is a tawdry one. As quickie video flics take over the industry, and film is phased out, the cinematic dreams of Reynolds die, and the careers of his actors fizzle. Past their prime, out of style [Graham looks more and more ridiculous on her skates as the film advances into the 1980s], and having snorted the entirety of their earnings up their nose, they are all left to pick up the pieces of their lives with little or no success.

Its set in the 70s and tells the story of a young man's rise to fame in the adult entertainment world because of his one and only attribute.  Marky Mark is the young man.  Burt Reynolds is the pornographer named Jack Horner. Julianne Moore plays a porn star who befriends and loves Marky Mark in a maternal way.  And there is also a new young actress with a great body who never takes off her roller skates. A few other well-defined characters round out a series of interrelated stories.

While Burt Reynolds and of course Don Cheadle are solid choices for their roles, the film hinges largely on the performance and natural charisma of Wahlberg, who is possibly the only actor who could even be imagined in this role without risking his career. Claims that the story is based on that of John Holmes are nothing but publicity to give it more legitimacy than a completely fictional narrative about the porn industry, which is really what it is. Wahlberg's character bears no specific resemblance to Holmes whatsoever, and the narrative is entirely generic of its topic: pool parties, drug use, filming porn scenes. The ""big package"" schtick is too repetitive and overdone, and in fact is the main drama of the entire film: Will we get to see it after witnessing the jaw-dropping over-reactions of nearly everyone else who appears on screen, or not? Such tension. Wahlberg's persona is portrayed as overly stupid, almost appearing to have a significant mental impairment, and with minimal comic advantage. His total wide-eyed gullibility gets tiring, but is balanced somewhat by the grittier drug deal scenes in the second half of the film.
Although this film does have its moments and is worth watching overall, it is not a legendary cinematic achievement.",1080259200,,1331,5.054545454545455
1352228,5,B00004TQF7,"This is an exceptionally well done film.
A careful balance of humorous art direction, incredible acting, and cleverly constructed dialogue allows ""Boogie Nights"" to ascend the stigma attached to the subject matter (which happens to concern a star rising and falling in the 1970's porn industry). It generates a surprisingly laid-back, groovy and even comforting mood while telling an intriguing story of a subculture about which most of us make presumptions, but know very little. The character studies are fascinating, most eliciting compassion for the weaknesses of a troubled community of remarkably average people who didn't pursue hedonistic tendencies as much as they sought acceptance, friendship and success in the only industry that would allow them to feign they were glamorous and special, as short-lived an illusion as it would end up being.",1078185600,,853,5.421052631578948
1352229,4,B00004TQF7,"The first half of this movie is very entertaining, with many memorable and funny lines of dialogue. The problem I had with the movie is that the characters have little or no redeeming qualities to appreciate them for 2 and a half hours! IF you can put that aside, as well as the porno topic in general, the movie succeeds rather well. Having grown up in that era, the music in Boogie Nights is exceptional, and provides a great atmosphere to the movie in particular. What a GREAT group of songs! Had these songs not been a part of this movie, I believe it would not be as well-received as it has been. The music adds SOOOOOO much.
  The DVD is a real treat regarding the video and audio. Near perfect on both counts truly adds to the enjoyment of the movie.
  No masterpiece here, but ignoring the subject matter and some of the things that are peripheral to it (re: drug abuse, violence), then Boogie Nights is an entertaining affair.",1074643200,,935,4.450292397660819
1352230,5,B00004TQF7,"Mark Wahlberg shedded his rapper persona forever by becoming Dirk Diggler, a character loosely based on porn star, John C. Holmes.  He gives an outstanding performance as the vulnerable, bus boy who wants fame and fortune at any cost.  He also has a great supporting cast with Julianne Moore, Don Cheadle, Heather Graham & John C. Reily.  But this movie belongs to Burt Reynolds, who gives the performance of his life as the pornographer who turns Diggler's life around.  If it wasn't for Robin Williams, the Oscar would have been his!!  Director Paul Thomas Anderson took all of his cues from Martin Scorsese because it looks and feels like ""Goodfellas"" and Raging Bull.

1352231,5,B00004TQF7,"Boogie Nights is a very stylish and funny film that is sure to please movie fans. While its slightly subtle and offbeat humor may be lost on some viewers, Boogie Nights is a hilarious movie.
The film is centered around the rise and fall of adult film star Dirk Diggler (played by Mark Wahlberg). Diggler starts out as a polite, bright-eyed kid but is slowly corrupted by life in the fast lane. Wahlberg gives a great performance as the dopey Diggler, whose words aren't necessarily meant to be funny yet often come off as hilarious.
The supporting cast also does an excellent job in this film. John C. Reilly plays Diggler pal and fellow adult film star Reed Rothchild to perfection. Reilly is funny throughout the movie, but stands out particularly in a scene where he is being interviewed about the impact of movie violence on viewers. Burt Reynolds, Julianne Moore, Don Cheadle, William H. Macy, and Philip Seymour Hoffman also deliver very strong supporting performances.
It's hard to explain what makes Boogie Nights such an entertaining movie. The humor in the dialogue is often quite subtle, but is nevertheless very effective. The characters are colorful and really seem believable despite their sometimes odd behavior and personalities.
Director/writer Paul Thomas Anderson did a great job with this film. Viewers are sure to feel empathetic towards the characters as they struggle and yet will likely find themselves laughing at just how bad and weird things get at times.
The scene that best sums up Boogie Nights as a whole occurs when Diggler, Rothchild, and friend Todd Parker find themselves in the home of an oddball drug addict trying to sell him some bad dope. The use of music and camerawork in this scene really creates a feeling of tension, yet viewers will probably be tempted to laugh at some of the various events of the scene. I won't say exactly what happens, but the entire sequence shows how Boogie Nights is a dichotomy of the laughable and the tragic.
In short, Boogie Nights is a very entertaining and memorable film. Wahlberg's portrayal of Dirk Diggler is top notch and the other actors also do excellent work in the film. Boogie Nights seems to get better with each subsequent viewing and I highly recommend the movie to fans of subtle and slightly dark humor.",1068768000,,2294,4.854591836734694

I personally love how the end of the 70s and beginning of the 80s is filmed - pure perfection, charting the change in music from disco to rock, and the change in the movie industry from film to videotape. I recommend this to anyone!!!",1064880000,,569,4.533980582524272
1352234,3,B00004TQF7,"This movie is as wonderful as ever, but I'm dissapointed in the ""special edition"" DVD. The commentary consists mostly of PTA talking about wanting to talk about how to talk about movies, but somehow never really getting around to talking very much about ~this~ movie, in terms of theme or character. Granted, that is my own quirky interest in commentaries as I am not a film maker, so someone in the business might find what he has to say quite fascinating.
Even more annoying though is that Whalberg literally, and I mean literally, yawns and grunts his way through his literally phoned in commentary. He also constantly complains that he's got to leave for the airport or something, as if in such great demand that he can't be bothered to discuss his work with the likes of us.  Geez, you'd think that knowing this will be listened to for many years, by many many people, he could have contstrained himself and pulled it together for the short time it took to do the commentary, or made an appointment for a different day!
Juliann Moore is delightful (when she's allowed to choose what she wants to say),as is John C. Reilly, and so I will give three stars for that.",1062806400,,1168,4.588516746411483

1352237,5,B00004TQF7,"Loosely based on the life and times of late porn king John Holmes, Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights is a true gem of a film.  Anderson weaves the classic tale of a rise and fall of a star, but puts a twist on it by placing the setting in the pornographic film industry during the 70's.  Mark Wahlberg plays busboy Eddie Adams who is discovered by director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds in an Oscar nominated role) and begins to build quite a career and makes a great life for himself; until (naturally) it all comes crashing down.  Anderson proves once again (just as he did in his previous film Hard 8) that he can weave an emotionally rich story with extremely well developed characters that we can releate to one way or the other, and despite the film's setting Boogie Nights comes out a real winner, and a true gem of a film.  The rest of the fantastic cast includes Julianne Moore (in her Oscar nominated role), Don Cheadle, John C. Reilly, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Thomas Jane, Ricky Jay, Heather Graham, Luis Guzman, Philip Baker Hall, William H. Macy, and the late Robert Ridgely.  All in all, Boogie Nights is a modern day classic that finds a writer/director at his best, and was also a star making vehicle for Wahlberg.",1058918400,,1230,4.572727272727272
1352238,5,B00004TQF7,"Without a doubt, one of my top ten favourite movies of the 90's, and a big part of that is the casting.
What Burt Reynolds had in mind with his boycotting of the film prior to the premiere, I have no idea, but he should get down on his hands and knees and thank P.T. Anderson for choosing him to anchor this character-driven masterpiece.
Burt, along with Julianne Moore (always great), Mark Wahlberg, Luis Guzman (my fave character actor these days), Don Cheadle, and William H. Macy make up the nucleus of one of the best ensemble casts of recent memory, and propel the already brilliant material into cinematic history.
The subject matter turned a lot of people off, but you have to look past your peripheral vision, and admire the superb soundtrack, editing, production, and direction--a phenomenal movie on all counts, even without the bonus material.
Anderson may be borrowing heavily from other influences such as Robert Altman and Martin Scorcese, but somehow he's come out with a unique voice of his own.  Much better than the subsequent bore, ""Magnolia"".",1058227200,,1063,4.87292817679558

The transfer and sound rate five stars.  The second disc is a little weak.  The deleted scenes with commentary are generally good, and commentary with them informative if a bit too reverential (PTA loves his actors).  The John C. Reilly Files are not ""all that.""  They consist of extended versions of three scenes where he is inventing the dialog as he goes along- a remarkable show of talent but you can see why they were cut short.  Plus they are non-anamorphic, so the quality is less.  The cast and crew information is weak, consisting only of filmographies.  The music video wraps it up (yawn).  Not really enough to fill out a 2nd disc.",1057708800,,802,4.577464788732394
1352240,5,B00004TQF7,"This is the first movie of Mr. Anderson's that I became acquainted with. The second was ""Magnolia"" Obvious parallels can be drawn between the two in terms of style and presentation.
""Boogie Nights"" is an awesome achievement and is the first movie you come to realize just how good an actor Mark Wahlberg really is. This movie elevated him from more than just another pretty face to a true actor courtesy of a magnificent performance. It was actually heartbreaking to watch at times. Of course, the fact that he was surrounded by a stellar cast certainly contributed to such an impressive performance.
This is a biting look at the porn industry of the 70s and is supposedly loosely based on the life of real-life porn king, John Holmes. Nonetheless, the performances are positively phenomenal. With a cast including Don Cheadle, Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Burt Reynolds, John C. Reily, the often overlooked Luis Guzman, Heather Graham; need I say more?
It is an unflinching look at the industry and a rather distrubing one to be sure. There is also no real or structured ""plot"" per say, but the focus is on the impact this particular lifestyle had on the personal lives of the participants and those closest to them.
This is an excellent exercise in character study and is most worthy of any movie collection. Do yourself a favor and pick it up. You will NOT be disappointed.",1057708800,,1405,4.809917355371901

There's so much to love -- Burt Reynolds used to even better effect than John Travolta was in PULP FICTION, a script that performs the exceedingly difficult balancing act of making a poignant, resonant story with characters who are completely ridiculous and laughable, a Polaroid-perfect rendering of the 70s and early 80s, and of course the cast. But of course this is a review of the DVD specifically -- and it's really, really worth buyting. P.T. Anderson's commentary is among the best DVD commentaries I've ever heard, the deleted scenes include wonderful performances by Luis Guzman and Don Cheadle, and overall the special features are really satisfying. The packaging for this DVD is in a great faux-70s style and includes an essay on BOOGIE NIGHTS from Film Comment magazine. Totally awesome.",1055289600,,856,5.078014184397163
1352242,5,B00004TQF7,"Aside from the fabulous cast, strong script, and flawless direction, I love this film for its willingness to portray such a controversial subject/industry so vividly, yet refrain from putting its own moral spin on it.
Anderson's film shows porn, the people who make it and the people who consume it, with disarming equanimity.  We see that they are silly, horrifically superficial, not terribly bright (except for the director and producers), completely amoral, shameless, sentimental, having INCREDIBLY bad taste in just about EVEYRTHING, greedy, corrupt, kind of dead inside.  Yet we can't help liking all of his characters, no matter what we see them do---because Thomas makes them HUMAN.  Just like us, whether we want to admit it or not.
One scene that especially resonates: when they randomly pick up the suburban frat boy for a spontaneous videotaped sex scene, who immediately and madly wants to screw the porn actress yet feels himself to be morally superior to her at the same time.
THAT, alas, is America and its relationship to pornography, flawlessly distilled.",1053993600,,1074,5.196531791907514
1352243,4,B00004TQF7,"Wake up call to those who think that the world of pornography is an innocent one. This shows the true side of the dark business in a raw, no-holds-barred kind of way.
Is this movie explicit? Definitely. It holds nothing back. You'll empathize with the characters, and hate them at the same time. At some parts in the movie, you may be seriously disturbed. Some characters are not who you think they are. Pay close attention to talented actor Don Cheadle (plays the part of Buck Swope), his character is most possibly one of the most unique.
This movie is somewhat like ""The Pornographer,"" but is much more subtle about morality issues. I praise the Pornographer for how little it uses nudity and sex in the movie and is still brilliant (ie, doesn't need all that to make it a good movie. Makes it show that it is one hell of a film). I thought that maybe Boogie Nights would of gone better in that direction, but at the same time, good old, straight up reality made it unique on it's own.
At the end of the movie you might possibly be wondering, ""Does this movie portray pornography as dark and immoral, or glorify it?"" A good question to ponder.",1051833600,,1146,4.461904761904762
1352244,5,B00004TQF7,"I first saw this movie when it was released on video back when I was in high school.  I was blown away by the performances and just the film as a whole.  I loved the movie, but I ran into a problem: I didn't know how to tell people about the movie.  I could say that there was this new movie (at the time) that was absolutely fantastic by a talented new director.  Then I would be asked what the movie is about.  And there is the rub; a description of the movie may not sound very appealing.  The movie is about Eddie Adams, a well endowed young man who breaks into the adult film industry in the late 70's.  The movie is his story, as he rises from just being a kid to the biggest star in the industry.  Boogie Nights also details his fall from the heights of fame.  The movie also deals with a large cast and the story sweeps wide enough to tell the stories of several other major characters.  Boogie Nights also stars John C Reilly, Don Cheadle, Burt Reynolds, Julianne Moore, and Philip Seymour Hoffman.  Everything sounds fantastic, but it a little difficult to sell someone on the idea of watching a movie about a kid breaking into the porn industry.  However, given the chance, this is a fantastic movie.
Simply put, this is a well told story and is really a variation on a very old theme.  The fact that it is set in the porn industry should not be a reason to not see the movie.  As a warning, there is quite a bit of nudity, drug use and cursing.  Children should not see this movie, and if the content is the cause of someone not seeing Boogie Nights, I understand that.  If the content is not a problem, then look past the subject matter and watch an excellent movie.",1050883200,,1679,4.232704402515723

Having seen the contents of both the original and the 2-disc DVD, I will echo other users' comments it's not worth spending the extra cheese for what little you get.
I feel this is a far more gripping movie than the director's follow-up, ""Magnolia"". I badly wanted to like it, but could not. That film convinced me that there is a very good reason that directors shouldn't get carte blanche on final cut, as P.T. Anderson had for that film.

Both P.T. Anderson's writing and direction are unsurpassed.  I've never seen a more perfect screenplay and character presentation.  I was so happy to see that this issue of the DVD had not one but two commentary tracks on it; one with Anderson, the other with the actors.  The unfortunate thing is, both are horrible.  Anderson begins by saying how important commentaries on old laser discs were to him in his career upbringing, and yet goes on to pontificate on everything but the movie we're watching, and I must say his vibe borders on narcissism.  The actors' commentary track does no better.  People expecting to hear about what the actors thought of the scene on the screen will be very disappointed there as well.  But alas, this file remains an all-time favorite with me.  Mr. Anderson's work is admired in highest regard.  His attitude I could do without.",1040688000,,1037,4.737430167597766

It's big, it's long and you're gonna love it!",1039564800,,329,4.7368421052631575
1352248,4,B00004TQF7,"""Boogie Nights"" was P.T. Anderson's first film after ""Sydney."" It starts with Mark Wahlberg as a going-nowhere-slowly kid from Torrance, California who works as a dish washer and sometime DJ at a strip club in Reseda. His home life is parched. His mother is an abusive, frustrated woman who hates her husband and berates her under-achieving son almost without surcease.

Finally, one day, Eddie, Wahlberg's onscreen character, meets Jack (Burt Reynolds) at the club. Reynolds ""sees something"" in the good-looking underage kid and eventually offers him a shot to star in one of his porn films. The basic come-on for this is the fact that Eddie has an unusually large [penis] and absolutely no problem with showing it off and using it with almost super-human stamina on anything and anyone at anytime.

He becomes a star and accomplishes his dream of showing people who don't believe he has anything at all (here we refer to his harpy mother) to give the world, that he can be somebody. But Eddie, whose miraculously arrived-at onscreen name ""Dirk Diggler"" comes to him in a dream, knows he has something, and he truly believes that his role as a porn star is his way of doing good in the world.

That is the basic conceit of the film, and P.T. Anderson traces the rise and fall of Dirk Diggler with uncanny precision and an unblinking evocation of the shallow, inescapably ignorant, touching, arrogant and deeply  wounded aspects of that world and the people who occupy it.

Walhberg is excellent as the completely sincere and desperately innocent Dirk. Burt Reynolds, in what I think is the finest performance of his career, is the center of this world and he is the only one in it with an actual understanding about how it all works. Julianne Moore, an actress of an almost transcendent talent, plays the unlikely role of a porn queen (though, frankly, she does not look like one at all) with a thoughtful and vulnerable touch. Heather Graham, who does, in fact, look like a porn star, is fine as Rollergirl, an actress who never removes her roller-skates. Ever.

But my favorite performers in this picture are John C. Reilly, the top star in Jack's stable until Dirk comes along, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman, an overweight gay grip in the movie company. If awards were given for the actor who shoves the most into the smallest role, Hoffman would win it hands down. He is simply brilliant in the few scenes in which he participates. Reilly is at his best in this film when, after some funny, childish competitions with Wahlberg, he becomes best buddies with his rival. P.T. Anderson is very careful to show us how really young these two are. And how incredibly naive as well. There is nothing sophisticated about the porn industry as seen through Anderson's basilisk lens.

Several scenes stand out. The coke insanity of Julianne Moore and Heather Graham whose cocaine dialogue is meticulously written and painfully, perfectly performed. It's a scene in which everything about coke is described with an almost manic simplicity.

The other scene I want to mention is the Second Act closer. In this scene Wahlberg, Reilly, and Tom Jane, who plays a completely unraveled coke head with a lot of bad ideas and a dangerous mixture of stupidity and violent anger, attempt to rip off a rich junkie, played marvelously by the inestimable Alfred Molina. This scene is a stand-alone masterpiece of tension, violence and and an awful kind of terrified, jittery hilarity which represents to me what a scene should do. It's riveting and frightening. The tension it creates is physical for the viewer.

Of course all P.T. Anderson buffs already own this film. It would be unthinkable not to. But even if you are not a particular fan of Anderson's, it is worth the time and money to at least rent this film. For some it may be just too difficult to watch. There is little that is not explored here (and what there is of that is explored in the next oeuvre of Anderson's, ""Magnolia""). Dirk's descent into becoming a common street hustler is hard to watch. And the vapid, often unattainable, sometimes downright moronic dreams of all the members of Jack's troupe are so heartrendingly portrayed that the viewer is hoping against hope that these wretched denizens of the movieland underbelly can at least find a tiny piece of what it is they are looking for.

As a DVD aficionado I would have liked a bit more supplemental material. The best of these are the color bars and the John C. Reilly stuff. I would have liked a little more of the daily set-ups and the shoot itself, but for that you have to get Magnolia which has an excellent movie ""diary"" included.

I would be remiss if I did not mention the fine work of the always-excellent William H. Macy who portrays an associate producer with a wife who cheats on him publicly and often.

And yes, in the final scene, we do finally get  to see what Dirk Diggler is so famous for.",1039392000,,4915,4.727803738317757

The movie focuses on the porn industry of the 70's and offers an almost raw insight into the highs and lows of such an industry.  Heather Graham shines as Rollergirl, and Julianne Moore is brilliant as 'mother' to them all.  Mark Walhberg does an impressive job of a young man entering the porn industry.  We travel with him through the good and very bad times - the drugs, the loss of stardom etc etc.  Boogie Nights isn't for everyone, but I enjoyed it.

I was kind of disappointed with the 2 disc release of the film because it was not all that different from the original 1 disc release. Most of the material here comes from the Criterion Collection laserdisc plus a little bit more extras, but still it deserves a better treatment (there's not even a trailer!). It's a lot like the Magnolia DVD. The 2 disc DVD is still pretty good though.
Also, beware of the hidden feature that appears 20 seconds into the Color Bars, it's more grotesque than the last shot in the film. If you liked this movie, take a look at P.T. Anderson's Hard Eight and Magnolia.",1031443200,,895,4.430303030303031
1352252,4,B00004TQF7,"P.T. Anderson's films have the reputation of being groundbreaking and original.  ""Boogie Nights"" is no exception.  The sceenplay in smart, edgy and at times, very humorous.  Anderson's film about the adult film industry is very interesting.  It lets you see how pornography can change your life, both good and bad.  The movie is great because this subject is something so unconventional.
The film is about the rise and fall and rise again of Eddie Adams, a porn star known better as Dirk Diggler.  the story is about his workings with Jack Horner (played wonderfully by Burt Reynolds) and other interesting people such as Rollergirl, played by Heather Graham.  The movie is surprisingly original and entertaining.  The soundtrack is cool, and it takes you straight to the seventies/early eighties.
The movie, in my opinion, has five great performances.  Burt Reynolds is spectacular as Jack Horner.  Julianne Moore is wonderful.  William H. Macy, one of my favorite actors is great as a husband dealing with his wife's new sex games with other men.  Another I really liked was Don Cheadle's performance as Buck, a stereo salesman who dreams of opening his own place, but has many set backs.
This film is great.  It is an important film.  P.T. Anderson is a very intelligent writer/director.  This film is a very mature film for a second film.  But with a film like ""Hard Eight"" as his debut, would you expect anyhting less than what ""Boogie Nights"" was?  This is an exceptional film.",1030320000,,1483,4.915322580645161
1352253,5,B00004TQF7,"This is what movie making is all about, telling a story of a different time in an emotional fashion, taking the characters on a ride-up, down, farther down, one last thing on the way down and then back up again.  Paul Thomas Anderson tells a tale of celebrity, porn, drugs, fun, crime, teenage dreams of debauchery, chance and hope.  It leaves nothing out and this DVD is the perfect medium to view the movie in.  The second disks supplements are funny and disturbing-PTA seems to be able to do that well.  He must have watched a lot of Stanley Kubrick movies.

In a sad turnaround on the rags to riches theme, Mark Wahlberg, who is nothing less than brilliant in this film, plays a teenaged loser with an abusive family who has one thing going for him: he's one hot stud, in his clothes and out of them. In a twist of fate, he's ""discovered"" by Reynolds, who invites him over to the famiiy homestead to audition for a part in his next movie. The audition requires the budding star to perform sexual intercourse with several people watching and critiquing his performance. He passes the test, and becomes an overnight porn sensation, renamed ""Dirk Diggler.""
Then we watch his tragic disintegration from superstar to drug addict (cocaine) back to his origins: a has-been loser in his early 20s. Wahlberg is so poignant, so powerful, he has the viewer in tears, even though the subject matter is not everyone's cup of tea.",1025913600,,1011,4.7175141242937855
1352255,5,B00004TQF7,"""Boogie Nights"" has shockingly lived up to the hype, one of few 'classics' that actually has for me.  It tells the tale of a nightclub worker and his change to 70's pornstar Dirk Diggler.  He is quickly drawn into a world of drugs and meaningless sex, believing that he has risen above his awful past, but he soon discovers that no matter how great you think you've become, you're still the same person you've always been.  P.T. Anderson (Magnolia) makes gold with this classic rags-to riches tale, offering a truly meaningful theme for an entire generation.
That said, I don't believe I'd suggest buying this before renting it.  It's a very acquired taste, and is really not the feel-good movie of the year.  It has replay value, but only over a large scale of time.  I recommend it, but rent it first.",1025308800,,803,4.619718309859155

I don't know, this film really moved me. In usual PTA form, all of the performances are brilliant. The soundtrack TOTALLY rocks. The special edition is great with all of its fun deleted scenes and stuff. The only thing that bothers me is PTA's commentary...he goes off on some major..tangents.

Second,  the ironic truth is that the subject matter has almost nothing to do with the reasons this film is so highly regarded.  While the behind-the-scenes look at the porn industry is interesting in its own right, it serves as a mere backdrop to the cast of characters we follow through the story.  Brilliantly told, this is a story about people and their reactions to the excesses of the late 70's / early 80's Hollywood sex scene.

1352259,4,B00004TQF7,"Early in ""Boogie Nights,"" Eddy Adams (having just been offered the chance to become the porn star whose rise and fall the film chronicles) is thrown out of his mother's house. He is unable to say anything but, ""I'm going to do something! You'll see!"" A lesser screenwriter would give Eddy an eloquent monologue. Paul Thomas Anderson allows Eddy to be inarticulate. He is smart enough to avoid making all his characters as smart as he is.
This is part of what earns the comparisons to the work of Martin Scorsese, Robert Altman and Jonathan Demme. Anderson allows each character in his world of '70s porn filmmakers to speak for him or herself in an epic that rises above its campy subject. His script is buoyed by awe-inspiring performances from rising stars in starmaking roles (Mark Wahlberg, Heather Graham), legends in career best work (Burt Reynolds, Robert Ridgely) and national treasures in consistently great performances (Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Don Cheadle). Anderson is as adept at doing interesting things with the camera as he is at creating compelling characters.
The film has a plodding third act that's better on repeat viewings, and it will be off-putting to those disturbed by graphic sex and violence (although, for it subject, it has little sex and nudity: about 15 minutes out of 155), but for those who can watch ""Taxi Driver"" without recoiling, it is that rare film that reveals something new with each viewing.
The sound transfer on this DVD suffers for those who have theater-quality sound systems, but the extras are more a problem than the sound. Although this single-disk version is loaded with extras, it is a letdown compared to its double-disk counterpart. Most annoying, Anderson's enthusiastic commentary references deleted scenes not included on this disk but included in the two (e.g.: the fall of Becky Barnett). Shame on New Line for not including Rahad Jackson's ending, even on the double disk!
The most fun extras are the character bios, also included in the double-disk set. For the mild fan, this disk will be more than enough, but for the hardcore fan more likely to buy the DVD, at only a few dollars more, the double disk is a better bargain.",1017619200,,2196,4.905913978494624
1352260,5,B00004TQF7,"Here is a film that is a fascinating look at an era, a controversial business, and some one of a kind characters.

 Right from the open this story sucks you in, to use an appropriate term.  Marky Mark Wahlberg plays a young naive boy, whose personal endowments, when discovered and marketed by a pornographic movie maker played by the legendary Burt Reynolds, make him a star re-named hilariously ""Dirk Diggler"".  Unfortunately for Dirk, the pitfalls of stardom await and engulf him too soon after his star has risen.  Will he survive, or fall?  Watch this and see.

The ensemble cast is knockout here.  The aforementioned Burt Reynolds makes a great comeback, and Wahlberg seems so real that you can feel just what he's going through as you view the film.  John C. Reilly is perfect as a fellow male porn star who helps mentor Dirk along with Reynolds.  I personally liked ""The Colonel"" a strange expressioned producer whose plastic smile and expression don't change a bit when viewing Dirk's credentials for the first time.  Hilarious!  Julianne Moore is outstanding as ""Amber Waves"", Dirks co-star.  She shows a wide range of emotion here.  There's also Heather Graham as ""rollergirl"", and William H. Macy in a great role as a camera man who is tortured by the infidelities of his wife, played by real life porn star Nina Hartley.  In a recurring situation she sleeps with crew members, which humiliates him in front of the entire set.  They're all waiting for a turn with his wife, as HE watches!  In a shocking scene, he finally snaps, but YOU must watch and find out how.

Now that I've tempted you, I must tell you that I've only given you an IDEA of what goes on here.  What I can't tell you beyond some descriptive words, is the great mood and flavor of the movie.  It DEFIES description, you must experience it.  Paul Thomas Anderson, only on his second outing, uses music, cinematography, and fashion to recreate the 70s in a style dare I say ""comparable"" to veteran master director Martin Scorcese.  The movie has a magic all it's own from these elements used in such a highly effective manner, it truly sizzles.  I'd also compare it to Brian DePalma's masterpiece ""Carlito's Way"" (see my review), for it's ability to capture the 70s era with such quintessential style and excitement.

""Boogie Nights"" is far more than a movie about the porn industry.  It's a commentary, a mockumentary, an adventure, a comedy, a drama, a treat for the senses, and a MUST SEE film that stands alone in it's originality.",1016755200,,2515,4.726436781609196
1352261,5,B00004TQF7,"Boogie Nights is not the greatest movie of all time, but the DVD package may be the best one available on the market at this time.  The film looks great and especially sounds great if you have the sound hooked up to a receiver and high quality speakers.  The music of the 70s never sounded better!
About the movie itself.  This movie is hilarious, depressing, entertaining and thought-provoking all in one shot.  Great performances abound, particularly from Burt Reynolds, the late Robert Ridgely (the Colonel), Philip Seymour Hoffman and Heather Graham (who you get to see quite a bit of in this movie, in more ways than one).  Mark Wahlberg is totally convincing as the ""gifted"" teenager with brains the size of peanuts while John C. Reilley personifies the classic 70's porno star (lots of hair and ugly as sin).  The latter two character's give and take throughout the movie is one of its strong points.
The story deals very little with actual porno filmmaking but more about the life and family of the folks involved in this type of life.  It is thoroughly convincing.  My only real complaint about the film is that it drags during the time that Dirk Diggler (Wahlberg) is out of the porno business and is trying to make it in other things, like music (although the recording scene is hilarious).
A great movie for people who like simple pleasures, like lollipops in their mouth and .... (sorry, you have to see the movie to complete the sentence).",1010361600,,1453,4.715415019762846
1352262,5,B00004TQF7,"My personal indication to a good DVD is how many times I find myself going back to it for more. This seems to be the case for Boogie Nights. Yeah, it seems a bit ridiculous to have an additional extras disc that doesnt include trailers or a feature documentary but hey I have high standards. Besides, the ultra 70s Orange and Brown packaging more than make up for my pet peeves because its actually fun to take out of your collection and open it up! The Menus are designed in the same vein and the music makes you want to dance before you select anything. Its nice to spend money on a disc that has had time and effort put into it rather than just being slapping in a keep case and costing 20-30 bucks. So it goes without saying that fans of  Boogie Nights will be very satisfied and its clear that although other special editions have come more fully packed the attention to detail alone makes this DVD a must have. The transfer and sound are flawless. In fact this is one of the few movies that makes you actually crank up the volume. The scene where the gang dances to J. P. Walk at Maurices disco makes you glad you bought 5.1 sound or at least hooked your DVD player into your stereo. So again I wanted to get up and dance. Two good commentary tracks supply even more humor and insight into one of the most unique films of the 90s. Although P.T Anderson may have been dragged into doing his track he offers one of the most natural, honest and refreshing director commentaries Ive heard in awhile. And I agree that John C. Reilley is a genius. Despite my complaining, the extra extras disc is still worth its weight with its inclusion of 10 deleted scenes that actually lasts more than 7 seconds like most and add more development to the story. The best by far being the very last which depicts Dirk attempting to rescue Becky Barrnet from a rather violent domestic. Fleetwood Mac never sounded so good!? The often-tepid filmography and bios are spruced up with correlating bios of an actors respective character which just adds more insight and besides a true Boogie Night geek needs to know all the Dirk Diggler titles. Although a video for You got the Touch would have been preferred (I swear thats a Survivor song) the Michael Penn video directed by P.T. Anderson is still pretty cool in his standard 1 take way. And all I have to say about the John C. Reilley Files is: sensiTIVE!! All in all like my other favorite DVD titles like Spinal Tap and Evil Dead 2 I constantly go back to find my favorite moments and watch them with my friends. Something I cant say about other DVDs. The biggest compliment is taken from my complaint; that I wanted more! For a 152-minute movie I sure didn't want it to end when I first saw it in the theater. The DVD is the same way. In a short while I exhausted the extras and again I didn't want it to end. I guess it proves Dirk Diggler was right. The heat will rock you!",1008288000,,2912,4.352941176470588

Director Paul Thomas Anderson is a gifted, articulate screenwriter who knows how to create real settings, natural dialogue, and nuanced characters.  This is the film that made the world take Mark Wahlberg seriously, and without ""Boogie Nights,"" he would have never been able to star in big-budget powerhouses like ""the Perfect Storm"" and ""Planet of the Apes.""

1352264,5,B00004TQF7,"After completing production for Hard Eight (also known as Last Exit Reno and Sydney: Hard Eight), a film that was critically-praised for its complex performances and authenticity in human psychology, writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson was declared as Most Promising Director of 1997. In late of that precise year, he fulfilled that very promise with the release of an even more critically-praised film that has been a comparison to the films of Martin Scorsese and Robert Altman, and that film is entitled &#8220;Boogie Nights.&#8221;
For this thirty-one-year-old&#8212;twenty-seven at the time&#8212;this was a breakthrough film he, in fact, had great inspiration to make long before it was even released at the early age of seventeen. It was then that he put together a 30-minute short film that was written and shot like a Spinal Tap documentary regarding the rise and fall of the illustrious Dirk Diggler. The short film, simply entitled &#8220;The Dirk Diggler Story&#8221;, was shot on video and edited from VCR to VCR. His father narrated it in a way that had you think you were watching an E! true Hollywood story, but soon enough a documentary was something it was far from looking like. Although school as a teenager never appealed to him as he had lacked to show any enthusiasm, Anderson's story was ultimately re-written into a feature film that was far from merely being one to come and go and become long forgotten. And who says you'll go nowhere in life without having to go to school? Anderson always wanted to be a filmmaker, and watching movies was the only education he needed.
The year is nineteen-seventy-seven. The city is Los Angeles, and adult filmmaker Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) meets Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg), a well-endowed dishwasher in a nightclub who may just be the answer Jack's been looking for to revolutionize the adult entertainment industry. &#8220;I got a feeling,&#8221; Jack tells him, &#8220;that behind those jeans is something wonderful just waiting to get out.&#8221; He recruits Eddie to be his newest star and Eddie, thirsty for fame, promptly agrees, changing his name to Dirk Diggler. Soon Dirk is the hottest, most talked about star in the adult entertainment industry, alongside Amber Waves (Julianne Moore), the veteran star who mourns for the son she's strictly not permitted to visit because of her lifestyle and the inappropriate environment which encircles her, and Rollergirl (Heather Graham), a high school dropout who's apparently never even had the slightest thought of removing her roller skates. On the peripherals, Little Bill (William H. Macy) seethes with rage while his wife cheats on him in public, Buck Swope (Don Cheadle) tries to elude the stigma of being a porn actor, and Reed Rothchild (John C. Reilly) refuses to deal with the &#8220;aging cycle&#8221; as he strives to have others think differently of him by persistently acting out as someone he's clearly no longer capable of being, while Maurice T. Rodriguez (Luis Guzman) is a club manager who dreams of being in one of Jack's films and yet fears that his genitals may not be large enough. (One of the many deleted scenes in both DVDs will show that.)
The good times roll and throughout them did I ever laugh (especially in such classic scenes as the ones where both Dirk and Reed are joined when playing the rolls of Brock & Chest in a James Bond-like series), but before long Dirk falls victim to the pressures of stardom and a drug habit that ruins his career, as, in reality, has it to so many others in this industry, while Jack struggles with porn's conversion from film to cheaper videotapes.
Anderson set out to write a narrative that had a large and complex cast of characters, which proved to be a challenge because of the enormity of the project. But at the same time, completing the feat on schedule with a modest budget was his greatest reward. At the heart of the narrative is how the diverse players in an adult entertainment industry come together to form a makeshift family&#8212;comically dysfunctional in many ways&#8212;but a family nonetheless. Their lives are entwined in mutual experiences that range from the flourishing highs to the brooding lows. &#8220;These characters are all searching for their dignity,&#8221; says Anderson. &#8220;They're just trying to find themselves.&#8221;
He initially had Leonardo DiCaprio in mind for the lead roll of Dirk Diggler, but, and I don't know about you but thankfully, DiCaprio couldn't get involved in the project because he was busy with another&#8212;James Cameron's ever so long and tedious and gushy Titanic, which makes men who are watching it feel like women, or made me feel that way, anyway. So he ultimately, after seeing what Mark Wahlberg can do in The Basketball Diaries and Fear, came across him in a coffee shop with the script, and one director's dream took a major step to becoming a reality from there. Now I don't know about you but casting Wahlberg for the lead roll was a very wise choice to make, as Anderson himself admitted and even went as far as saying that he was glad he got Wahlberg instead, because by making that choice, Wahlberg then grew to be this very flamboyant actor with plenty of other rolls as significant as the one here being thrown at him, as that particular roll was the one that obviously claimed him to fame, as Heather Graham's in the film too did the same. (Others say Graham's roll in Drugstore Cowboy was the one to do so, but I think it merely got her noticed.) And if you're wondering why John C. Reilly has yet been in all of Anderson's feature films, including one of his short ones entitled &#8220;Flagpole Special&#8221;, it's simply because Reilly, next to the middle-aged, sad-looking Philip Baker Hall, happens to be his most beloved actor. (&#8220;The simple look of his face makes me smile,&#8221; Anderson acknowledges.)
Boogie Nights, a classic Hollywood story that can relate to many others in the industry who've hit the low road, is an exhilarating ride along the underbelly of the nineteen-seventies, featuring colorful camera work, a dynamic seventies soundtrack, and tremendous performances from the entire cast, most distinguishably Reynolds' in an Oscar-nominated comeback roll. (...)
Boogie Nights has the quality of many great films, in that it always appears to be alive and involves us in the moment-to-moment sensation of seeing these people's lives as they are lived. In his profession, Anderson is a proficient reporter who fills his screen with understated, genuine details. The man is in love with his camera, and somewhat of a showoff in sequences inspired by Robert De Niro's rehearsal in the mirror in Raging Bull, the renowned nightclub entrance in Goodfellas, and a shot in I Am Cuba where the camera pursues a woman inside a swimming pool.

1352266,4,B00004TQF7,"(...)Which brings me to BOOGIE NIGHTS. I'm not entirely sure WHY I liked this film. It could be the soundtrack that recalls AMERICAN GRAFFITI. It could be director Paul Thomas Anderson's Scorcese-esque approach to the filming. (...) all I know is this is definitely one of the most orginal and daring films of our time and is just an all-around masterpiece of Americana soaked in pure darkness.
Director Anderson assembles a (...) cast for a truly amazing movie, his first true ""opus"" before the magnificent MAGNOLIA. When I heard that ""Marky"" Mark Wahlberg was being cast as the lead, I started laughing. Then I heard that the previously ""washed-up"" Burt Reynolds was co-starring. I shook my head in embarrassment and I remember thinking that all of this, combined with the bad preview it got from Entertainment Weekly(the same year BATMAN & ROBIN got a HUGE two-page preview), BOOGIE NIGHTS was doomed to fail...boy, did it surprise people.
It brought me back to the time when my sister and Mom tried to tell me that PULP FICTION was going to be a failure and it turned out to be a monster-hit.
I watched history repeat itself. Every critic gave it so many four-star ratings, you would think that they were trying to start a galaxy to oppose the one we had. Reynolds even got a nomination for Best Supporting Actor and the movie went to do big business.
Oh yes, then I finally watched the movie...and it was good.
Director Anderson takes you on a relentless(and I DO mean RELENTLESS) trip through discovery, stardom, fame, fortune, breakdown, the ultimate fall, retribution, and then ultimate redemption, all in that particular order. It's not for weak stomachs or the faint-at-heart. This is a harsh movie. It's not a movie about porn or sex or drugs or alcohol, nor does it dwell on these things. This is a movie about the people in that particular setting and allows us to see how they live(and sometimes die) in that given setting.
The fore-mentioned superb cast does a knockout job. Wahlberg is absolutely PERFECT as the youngster whose innocence is corrupted and broken to make him a greedy, hard-shelled rock of his former self. Aiding that is Reynolds who plays the fatherly adult-film director, Jack Horner. What Reynolds does NOT do is make his ""comeback bid"" apparent. Instead, he wisely and selflessly underplays his part so that he blends into the film. He's never been better here. Underlining the stellar pairing is Don Cheadle who plays such an innocent among sin, you identify with his characters financial and romantic difficulties easily. Heather Graham(the cast's weakest link) plays ""Rollergirl"". The rest of director Anderson's cast(his trademark ""company of actors""), the frantic Julianne Moore, John C. Reilly, Philip Seymour Hoffman, the talented William H. Macy, Melinda Dillon, Luis Guzman, Philip Baker Hall, Ricky Jay, and Alfred Molina all show up here, playing a cadre of unforgettable characters who all long for the bigger, better deal but take the train on the rollercoaster known as the Rise and Fall and Rise Again.
Unbelievably beautiful in its conception and exceptionally well-directed, BOOGIE NIGHTS is a movie-lover's movie.
As for the DVD, the color is better, the sound is booming, and there's a brand-new commentary track with pretty much the ENTIRE CAST and we get a couple more deleted scenes which features a look at the fate of Becky's married-life, a scene which should have been, by all rights, in the film in the first place to sum up her character.
Get this film. You won't be disappointed.

As for the movie itself, well, it's big in scope and covers a lot of ground in a very entertaining fashion, but I have to grudgingly hold out on that fifth star as the message has been heard many times before (in fact, I find the underlying plot remarkably similar to Goodfellas - boy wants to be a gangster/star; boy becomes a gangster/star; boy lives the high life; boy does too much coke and screws everything up; boy has to come begging to former employer for help).  There is a lot to like about this movie, though; the performances are excellent (Wahlberg is so sweet you can't help but like him and Burt Reynolds hasn't been this good since - well, ever!), and the story provides plenty of laughs and drama, and even the minor characters feel pretty real, too (i.e., the perverted ""Colonel"" and that weird guy dancing around to Sister Christian amidst the popping fireworks).

1352270,5,B00004TQF7,"No one, atleast those who have experience it, could possibly deny the power and significance that ""Boogie Nights"" was for the 1990's. If P.T. Andersen is trying to revolutionize or merely making his mark in the movie industry, he's doing well, and doing it his own way.
""Boogie Nights"" cronicles the porn industry in the late '70's early '80's through the relationships, emotions, and the business of doing porn of a ""family"" of porn stars helmed by bravura performances by Mark Wahlberg, Julianne Moore, Heather Graham, and a especially welcome and outstanding performance by the one and only Burt Reynolds. Wahlberg plays Dirk Diggler (atleast that's his porn star name) who works his way from the bottom up, only to find that with the excess of porn stardom and all the ills money can buy, love and family is about all you have when you're in ruins.
Work past all the porn, and you have a very humanistic movie. Anyone can view this movie with disgust and offense, but that's not what ""Boogie Nights"" is here to do. Andersen wants to show us that excess isn't all it's cracked up to be. If we want to seek redemption we must find it in the ones we trust and love. How appropriate that a movie about things falling apart and discovering the true essentials in life be based on the porn industry in the '70's when image, music, and flashy lights were everything and emptiness purged the human heart.
Andersen does not make movie to entertain, but to tell a story about the essentials of being human. Being somebody is like being nobody until we are truly loved and belong. And like Aimee Mann's song in ""Magnolia"", ""It's not going to stop till you wise up"", the same rings true in ""Boogie Nights"", an outstanding film!",999475200,,1719,4.639344262295082
1352271,5,B00004TQF7,"Like many, I was somewhat skeptical about this film upon its first release. I skipped it in the theaters in lieu of more ""fall appropriate"" titles like ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""Good Will Hunting"" and while both of those were very well made, they did not hold a candle to this film. Mark Wahlberg makes us forget about that whole Marky Mark fiasco of the early nineties with a sheer volcanic starring debut. As the sometimes naive pawn of the industry Dirk Diggler, he runs the gauntlet of emotions, from a particularly heart breaking confrontation with his mother at the beginning to a terrible and hilarious session at a recording studio, Wahlberg showed us that he is far from a flash in the pan. Julianne Moore and Burt Reynolds shine as the patriarch and mother of this broken yet lovable extended family. Heather Graham is effective as the lovable yet dim Rollergirl,and PTA regulars John C. Reilly and Phillip Seymour Hoffman prove yet again that they are the two most underrated actors in the business by turning in pitch perfect performances as Dirk's co-star and assistant. Hoffman is very moving in the New Year's Eve sequence. The script crackles with dialogue that can be both tragic and uproariously funny all at the same time. The only thing I had trouble believing upon my first viewing was that it was written by a 26-year old. Every detail of 70's so-called ""fashion sense"" is present and the direction is staggering. A brilliant movie that probably cannot be praised enough, so I'll end it like this. I loved this movie.",998265600,,1538,4.785714285714286
1352272,5,B00004TQF7,"or I might be so pissed off at PT Anderson for releasing this version that I might stop watching his movies.  But I am a PT Anderson fan, and while he may have to change his act somewhat after 'Magnolia' to maintain a sizable audience, you can still hark back to the good old days in 1997 when 'Boogie Nights' was first released with this superb New Line Platinum Series Two Disc DVD. Back when Mark Wahlberg wasn't the star of every other movie released,before Juliane Moore became Hannibal's love interest, when Burt Reynolds looked like he might have a future. 'Boogie Nights' dances from one dazzling sequence to another (the party scenes at the beginning of the movie are my favorite), we periodically check in on all the characters, and their lives in and out (no pun intended) of the underground world of pornography.
Then apropriately, the eighties begin, and it all starts to get nasty- the advance of videotape threatens to cheapen the sex industry, Wahlberg and buddies begin doing too much coke to perform on camera, and ego and greed finally begin their long downward spiral.
Great director/cast commentary and extras, (there are enough deleted scenes to cut another movie with) make this a must have for those who didn't already invest (money) in this DVD.",996537600,,1270,4.799086757990867
1352273,4,B00004TQF7,"I'm not going to comment on the splendid movie itself. Yes, it's great, even if it is a bit unreal in the treatment of the real events which inspired it (some even feel it's unfair), and in fact, it's one of those movies you *need* - but that's not the point here. Instead, I'm going to concentrate on this edition only. When I saw this DVD on Amazon I was *so* excited to see what I thought would be the ultimate edition of ""Boogie Nights"". I got it... and it isn't! It misses at least one excellent, long scene which wasn't restored on the second DVD, in the extras! :( The scene I mean is Alfred Molina's ""Eddie Nash"" shooting it out with the cops near the end of the movie. In the commentary present on this DVD Anderson says the scene was cut because it ""interrupted the flow"". Well, just what are you talking about, PTA? Maybe it's true for the US release but here that scene was and is present in all TV and video versions and I really have no idea why it's missing from this US edition. Are you planning another DVD release with that scene restored, PTA? Fortunately, I have the old European VHS edition as well, and therefore can enjoy the movie in its full version, even if it means switching between both editions to see the full picture ;)
So... just a word of warning to the buyers: buying this you WON'T get a truly complete version of ""Boogie Nights"". Fortunately, with our older release of the movie AND this DVD now I have what I think is the full version - all that remains now is buying ""Exhausted"" and ""Wadd"" to complement the movie! :) It's simply too bad that a version advertised as THE full edition isn't really what it's purported to be. All the excellent extras practically make up for it, but still, some bad taste remains... either you give us a genuinely full, 100% complete release, or you don't advertise it as such! For this, I need to take one star off. Bundled with our older European edition containing the ""Molina scene"", however, the complete ""Boogie Nights"" get not just five but ten stars! :)",996019200,,2031,4.404255319148936

I bought it anyway and almost forced myself to watch it again, and I loved it.  Then I watched the commentary on this DVD and I began to speak the praises of this film and it's great filmmaker.  Anderson's first film, Syndey or Hard Eight, is great but is usually overlooked.  Boogie Nights had the music and the look to be noticed.  Most people are wary of this film because they think that's it's just about porn, but that's not true at all.  Anderson has managed to use the porn industry in the late seventies and early eighties and paint a portrait of a very disfunctional ""family"".  We also see the main character Eddie Adams, later Dirk Diggler, take a very Jake LeMotta approach to life.  This Raging Bull referance is actually mentioned by Anderson on the commentary track.  This commentary is by far the best one I've ever heard and I'm glad that it accompanies a great film like Boogie Nights.",991094400,,1046,4.429319371727749

I think that a truly great film will engender the desire to see it over and over again.  Although I certainly applaud the film I have no real desire to see it again.  And it's not because of the subject.  I've seen numerous films where the subject matter didn't exactly thrill me but yet i've enjoyed watching some of those other films over and over again.  Goodfellas comes to mind to name one.  And to me that's a very similar film in respect to it's taking a somewhat romanticized concept (american's love gangsters the same as guys love women and the concept of porn) and demystifies it down to it's real essence.  But with Goodfellas I enjoyed the ride more while still feeling like I was seeing an accurate unromanticized portrayal of mob life.
Burt Reynolds, Mark Wahlberg, William H. Macy, and Julianne Moore give great performances.  Very unexpected in some cases.
The film is uncompromisingly honest and effective just with something unpalatable about it.  An important and extremely well done film but not one I feel like I need or want in my collection.",986342400,,1222,4.663551401869159
1352278,5,B00004TQF7,"Boogie Nights is one of the best films of the Nineties and a film that covers a culture that is not chronicled in any other major motion picture. Where others never dared to make a film, Anderson not only makes it but creates a style and operatic super-film style that blows the viewer away.
The music, style, emotion from-top-bottom, are captured executed from the mind to out of the eye. Nothing is overlooked.
Popular music plays such an important role in movies. Anderson knows this as well as Scorsese does. All of which seems to have sprouted out of SCORPIO RISING.
The juxtaposition of the characters being/acting happily naive in lieu of their socially deviant lifestyle and ultimately their hitting rock bottom is a device shifts one's emotion to see these characters so strong that it could bring the viewer to tears.
Julianne Moore's character is captivating. Burt Reynolds revitalizes himself in his role. John C. Reilly and Marky Mark are so poignant and pathetic, it's great. Heather Grahmm establishes herself here. Phillip Seymour Hoffman sets his pace. Don Cheadle is hillarious. William H. Macy not only portrays but convinces.
What PT Anderson gives us is not just a porno opera chronicle, but a range of emotion that is rarely duplicated on screen. We get the reaction of real people to their environment, in this case a socially deviant lifestyle. PT Anderson gives us the gate way to empathize and sympathize with these REAL people whereas others would give us a pit of pornographers to merely scorn upon.
All done with outstanding camerawork and musical weaving.

Film covers the adult film industry from 1977-1984, and Dirk is an overnight sensation.  He's welcomed into Horner's circle which is pretty much a motley bunch:  Amber (Julianne Moore), a mother figure who occasionally has a cocaine binge, Rollergirl (Heather Graham), a sex kitten who feels lost in life, Scotty (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), a gay sound man with a crush on Dirk, Reed (John P. Reilly), a fellow porn star, Little Bill (William H.

All are in a family type of relationship, so this reminds one of ""Goodfellas"", only we have pornography instead of guns and murder.  As Dirk's success grows so does his head, and he changes from a genuinely likable kid into an irrational a**hole.  We really don't enjoy this change.  But this movie is powerful on so many levels that I don't have the room to list all of them.  One worth noting:  The film is an observant human portrait; and yet of so many characters.

This is the ultimate guy's movie, with great characters, fancy clothes, cars, women, classic tunes and plenty of laughs thrown in for good measure, and the fact the movie revolves around the porn industry will not appeal to young women. I think most women who have experienced the 70s or just grew up and accepted a risque film will enjoy it (like my mom), but I wouldn't try and rent this for date night anytime soon.

If you shy away from onscreen sex, this film should probably be avoided, but for the rest of us - a great piece of filmmaking and a flick that keeps you glued from start to finish.  The part of the film about the actors and their fall from grace is a little disturbing for anyone that has lived through the drug scene and it's sometimes severe consequences, but straight honesty and drama from the director with, like I said, an excellent screenplay.
The DVD version is not a disappointment.  Many deleted scenes, movie commentaries by both the director and another version with the director and cast (Rather brave of the director to have the commentary shot with a drunk Mark Wahlberg.), soundtrack, etc...

Crapfests with Eddie ""Egomaniac"" Murphy trying to overact in a retarded comedy. We seldom get to see films that are as well directed, written, and acted as this film. Mark Wahlberg plays Eddie, a teenager with a big....uh, dream. He meets the director of Pornographic films, played by Burt Reynolds in his best role since he was the Bandit. Eddie soon forgets his past as a bus boy, takes the name of Dirk Diggler, and takes the world of adult films in the palm of his hand. The film does not try to glamorize the adult industry, and it does not try to bash it, it shows it truthfully, as it is: an industry like any other. This film also does not take the conventional road of trying to cram a bad story into 90 minutes. Instead it opts to put an incredible story into over 2 hours of a brilliant film. P.T.

Then the film goes back to aimless stupid wandering, and finally finally finally comes to a close.
The way Paul Thomas Anderson is able to supply his fine cast of actors with big scenes, in which they get to choke back tears, scream at each other, and just generally ACT ACT ACT ACT in big broad strokes, is truly remarkable.  If only he was able to tie all these bravura moments into something that was of any value whatever.

1352288,4,B00004TQF7,"This Platinum series is a noticeable improvement over the last release.  Paul Anderson, the director, says this is the ""definitve version"" of Boogie Nights.  While I agree with him in many ways, I STILL had the need for MORE supplemental material.  The packaging is really nice.  It opens like a book, revealing 2 attractive discs, one with the film, the other with supplemental material.  Trying to release these discs with your fingers may be the hardest thing you ever did.  They are VERY difficult to release from the case.  This edition does not come with a booklet, but gives you plenty to read on the inner sleeves.  Once you pop the DVD's into your player, you'll see that the menu's are simple and very easy to navigate.  You can set-up your monitor with a simple 'color bars' set-up.  The picture quality is beautiful.  Color saturation is noticeably improved over the previous release, and overall the widescreen image is attractive and clean.  The sound is also greatly improved over the previous release.  It is cleaner and more vibrant and the stereo separation seems to be much more precise.  The music sounds incredible and the vocals are clear and sharp.  The firecracker scene at the drug dealers house sounds wonderful!  The audio commentary is reason enough to get this DVD.  Paul Anderson has almost every person you'd ever want to listen to on this DVD.  They are all talking in their own vulgar and natural ways throughout the film, and most of the time, it is quite amusing and informative.  This version has an additional few minutes of a deleted scene that is great to watch including Becky, Jerome and a car crash with Mark Whalberg driving!  John C. Reilly is a really funny guy, and his scenes in this DVD, (The John C. Reilly Files), are a pleasure to watch.  The DVD also includes the ""Try"" video, a nice little addition.  In conclusion, I love this film, and anyone else who does should get this DVD.  I recommend it highly, I just really wanted to see more supplemental footage, (probably because I love this film so much).  Besides that, this DVD is excellent, great picture and wonderful sound, and the supplemental footage is incredibly entertaining.  **By the way, go to the 'color bars' and let it play for about 30 seconds....something shocking will appear on your screen**  Enjoy this DVD!",972259200,,2329,4.774436090225564
1352289,5,B00004TQF7,"Boogie Nights may not only be the best movie in the best year for film since 1976 but the best of it's decade.  Mark Wahlberg sheds his Marky Mark persona by play Dirk Diggler, an up and cuming porn star who finds a family in his co-stars.  Director Jack Horner, played by a resurgant Burt Reynolds, is the father figure to Dirk while Amber Waves (Julianne Moore) assumes the role of mother.  It's a dysfuncial family at that but maybe the most stable a young man in the 1970's San Fernado Valley could have.  Dirk starts out a wide-eyed kid from Torance who gets swept up by Horner and co. after a blow-up with his emotionally abusive, acholic mother.  Paul Thomas Anderson directs with such skillful hand that we come to understand the decisions he makes but realize where it's going to lead.  The assemble cast includes a lintany of names too long to metion all of them but particularly good is John C. Reilly, collaberating again with Anderson who'd given him his best role yet in Hard Eight.  The reissued DVD is absolutely worthwhile even for those of you who already have the previous.  The most notable inclusion is a Scorsese-esque scene in which Dirk attempts to come to Becky's aid after her marriage turns sour.  In his voice over commentary PTA explains he wanted somebody in the film to get away clean thus decided to make the difficult cut.  The other nine deleteds are just as good, nothing new but still as entertaining as they were when the DVD was first released.  I hate to turn people off to such a fabulous film but I've found most people have a very strong reaction to it, you'll either love it or hate it, there's no middle ground here.  And while I hate to discard great films such as Goodfellas and Pulp Fiction into a runners-up catogory I can't help but think this was the best film of the 90's and it's reach could easily span two decades if not for Raging Bull (which is given proper credit for inspiring the film's final scene).

1352291,5,B00004TQF7,"Having not caught on to how good he was in 1997, the American moviegoers finally realized how good Paul Thomas Anderson is when ""Magnolia"" was finally released on video in late July 2000, most having missed it in the theatres in early January.
I remember the week I saw PTA's third picture on video, the very week it came out, it was the subject of every chat room, the topic at every video store, the hottest rent on the shelf (thanks mainly to its much talked about frog-raining climax).
But although most would favor with Anderson's three hour opus, I  say ""Boogie Nights"" is his masterpiece. Probably because anyone familiar with Robert Altman's ""Short Cuts"" knows it has so much in common, and is so much more ambitious than ""Magnolia"", right down to the natural disastor climax, that it could be said that Anderson deliberately plaugerized Altman's plotlines(it was made six years before, you know).
""BN"" on the other had was something PTA had brewing in his mind for years; he made a short Dirk Diggler mockumentary in 1987, and wrote the first drafts of ""Nights"" before his debut feature ""Hard Eight"". Every character in the film is memborable both tragically and comically. They seem completely fresh and original with every repeat viewing, even the most minor of characters such as Eddie's unmericful mother, the eccentric mechanic Todd Parker, the dope fiend Rhnand Jackson and his Chinese comrade Cosmo, and Phillip Baker Hall's porn producer mafioso-Floyd Gondolli. Not to mention career high performances by Phil Hoffman and John C. Reilly, PTA has compiled one of the greatest casts ever for a contemporary film.
Sure the direction and editing bear a striking resemblance to that of Scorsese and Schoonmaker, but that's surely not an insult to Anderson or his film. Unlike ""Magnolia"" Anderson crafted ""Boogie Nights"" with ALL his own imagination, conviction and heart.",970876800,,1883,5.015974440894569

Like all the other P.T. Anderson films, it's ideas and themes couldn't be anymore richer, but the overall result is slightly marred by a somewhat lack of discipline in regards to storytelling. But still, this is the kind of film-making that doesn't come around very often, it keeps you intellectually and emotionally gripped throughout it's entire duration. ""Boogie Nights"" delves into the lives of certain people involved with porn, and examines the deteriorating morals, social isolation and lost identity that lies behind their garish facade of fame. I was impressed with the movie's chronicle of the adult film industry's rise and fall, it depicts the escalating sordidness at a real gut level. One thing that really drives the story is how the characters and their actions challenge us, we may object to what they do, but we also in some way understand why they're doing it. Mark Wahlberg, Julianne Moore and Burt Reynolds are potent in their roles, but it is the supporting cast of Heather Graham and Don Cheadle that really steals the show. The only thing that bothered me about this movie was how it sort of spun out of control during the climax, and suddenly wrapped up neatly in the denoument, it just didn't feel ""right"". But overall, ""Boogie Nights"" is still an exceptional picture, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to be enthralled and provoked at the same time.

Now, onto the DVD.  The DVD doesn't add much  features.  It isn't well produced at all.  It just seems that someone  wanted this as a DVD release and they had two days to put it on the disk.  Now, naturally, this doesn't detract from the movie.  And if you want the  movie on DVD format go ahead and buy it.

1352298,4,B00004TQF7,"Paul Thomas Anderson's sweeping story of a colorful group of people involved in the 70's porn business is unforgettable. It will stand as one  of the best films of the 1990's. For one thing he shows us that these are  ""people"" like the rest of us in their hopes, fears, desires,  happiness, and misery. The perfomances are all first rate, but they had a  incredible script to work with including the great dialogue. The film has  artistic integrity while it pulls of the tricky camera shots, lighting and  sound. If you have a home theatre listen carefully to the music at the  party, in the films first half. You will hear ""Spill the Wine""  and how it sounds to someone who is under the water in the pool. Very cool.  But more than the technical aspect of this film, is it's story and  development of character that continually changes as the films spins  through the years where it takes a dark turn from free sex 70's to aids  ridden 80's.

1352299,5,B00004TQF7,"Like many people, I was torn between going to see this movie and staying away. While it is not a porn movie, the subject matter deals with the ins  and outs of the adult film industry.
Since it stared Mark  ""Mary-Mark"" Walhberg, I subconconciously convinced myself that  other people would ""know"" why I was really there. I'm glad I  ignored my self-concious voice, and went anways. Wahlberg was a good actor  and the film was actually interesting.
Of course,I developed a theory  afterward that the sucess was partly atrributal to his own experiences as a  hunky rapper. Having attended one of his concerts, I can vouch that sex  appeal was the selling point (since the lyrics were hardly new, there had  to be some hook)at this time. Wahlberg actually performed in his underwear  for the audience as the night went on.
Like the fictional Dirk Diggler,  perhaps Walhberg realized he was being typecast and/or too limited because  of the very same sex appeal that launched his career. The irony is evident  throughout several scenes in the movie, and it is quite moving at times.  The uncanny simmilarities could be the very same reason why Walhberg  decided to star in this movie.
Although other people (with the exception  of Leonardo Dicapprio) could have been in the starring role, Wahlberg's own  personal background makes the story more compassionate. People need to be  aware of what is going on around them so they do not get exploted by shady  characters.
Even though I am a big fan of 70's clothes,some of the  selections worn by the characters on and off screen are really horendous,  but that aside, this is a very enjoyable movie.",964483200,,1642,4.792857142857143

The dynamic direction, depth of actors,  completeness of script, and overall passion displayed by all involved  contributed to a masterpiece.
For those hesitant to see this film due to  its material. Remember that great movies are rarely about a way of life, in  this case porn, rather movies focus on the personalties around that way of  life. If Boogie Nights were solely about porn it would have been  exploitive, which thankfully it was not.

1352302,5,B00004TQF7,"""Boogie Nights"" is one of those movies that defies categorization. It's about the porno industry, and has its fair share of sexual content, but never titillates. It's often funny but the humor is  usually of the dark variety. Much of the content shouldn't be entertaining,  but the movie succeeds grandly as entertainment.
It's the oblique nature  of ""Boogie Nights"" that makes it so special. It's not a film that  will give you pat answers; rather, it'll challenge you in a way few films  do. What other movie in recent memory was able to take an explicit sex  scene and make it sexually unexciting? ""Boogie Nights"" has just  such a scene, and it serves one purpose: to de-glamorize the world of porno  and portray it for what it doubtless is: a business where people do nothing  but try to make a living.
""Boogie Nights"" centers around the  life and times (the late 1970's and early 1980's) of Eddie Adams (Mark  Wahlberg, who's dynamite), who is discovered by porno impresario Jack  Horner (Burt Reynolds, in another dynamite performance) and soon changes  his name to Dirk Diggler and becomes a porno star.
Dirk's story is  intertwined with the stories of others who share his world: coked-up porn  queen Amber Waves (Julianne Moore), who plays surrogate mother to Dirk  because she is legally barred from seeing her own child; Reed Rothschild  (John C. Reilly), his best buddy and co-star; Rollergirl (Heather Graham),  a porn performer who insists on ""acting"" with her rollerskates  on; Buck Swope (Don Cheadle), a black porn bit player who dresses like Gene  Autry and dreams of owning a stereo store; and Little Bill (William H.  Macy), Horner's quietly enraged right hand man, whose wife literally does  it with everyone and anyone and doesn't care if her husband sees her doing  it.
Director Paul Thomas Anderson tells the characters' stories  vignette-style, much as Robert Altman would.
In particular, Dirk's  rags-to-riches-to-rags-to-riches story is alternately funny, horrifying,  sad and uplifting. In particular, there is a scene in which a strung-out  Dirk tries to make a drug deal with a crackhead dealer. Problem is, the  cocaine he's trying to sell is fake, the dealer's house is full of armed  thugs, and his friend keeps lighting firecrackers as the whacked-out dealer  listens to Night Ranger's ""Sister Christian"". Anderson directs  this scene so beautifully that the tension and fear is absolutely  unbearable after a while, but the whole setup is so bizarre that you can't  help but smirk your way through it. That's great directing, folks.
The  performances are all standouts, but Reynolds' and Moore's are especially  fine. In addition, the period feel (down to the Cheryl Tiegs poster on  Dirk's bedroom wall) and music is right on target.
This is a brilliant  film, and though it's too in love with its own brilliance from time to  time, the flaws are greatly outweighed by the film's tremendous energy and  superb performances.",963360000,,2959,5.022680412371134
1352303,3,B00004TQF7,"Long overdue, we finally get a film about the porn industry during the 70s and early 80s.  Obviously, Hollywood did not want to touch the subject, but Paul Thomas Anderson, realizing the fertile ground that largely lay  unexplored, jumped in with both feet.  And he has done an admirable job,  even if one can sometimes see that he is borrowing from the likes of  Scorsese and Altman, among others.
""Boogie Nights"" tells the  story of Eddie (Mark Wahlberg), a young busboy who rises to fame as porn  star Dirk Diggler.  Mark Wahlberg plays the kid who, early on, runs away  from his parent's home to knock on the door of Jack Horner (well played by  Burt Reynolds).  Horner shoots films for the porn industry (this is at a  time before videotape became the standard).  He has a nice house, a nice  car, and makes lots of money.  He shares the house with Amber Waves  (Julianne Moore) and the two function as sort of surrogate parents to Dirk.  Other characters include Rollergirl (Heather Graham) who always wears  skates - even during sex, Buck (Don Cheadle) who is into the cowboy look  and whose day job is selling stereo equipment, and Reed (John C. Reilly)  who quickly becomes Dirk's buddy.  On the technical end there's the  assistant director Little Bill (William H. Macy of ""Fargo""), and  cinematographer Ricky Jay (who I liked in David Mamet's  ""Homicide"" and ""House of Games"").
What I really like  about ""Boogie Nights"" is the way that Anderson contrasts style  and subject.  From the opening scene (one long uncut shot that recalls the  opening of Orson Welles' ""Touch of Evil"") the style of the movie  is nothing short of exciting and - in itself - is highly entertaining. What  we are supposed to get excited about, however, is another story: the  characters are mostly a sad, dull, simple-minded group.
Anderson can't  quite rise above a level of condescension here.  In one scene, around  Horner's pool, everyone's partying, doing cocaine and having fun when the  phone rings.  It's ""some kid looking for his mother"".
At least  one critic that I read noted that Anderson ""plagiarized"" a  sequence from ""Raging Bull"".  He's obviously a fan of Scorsese,  but I can see nods to other filmmakers as well.  The scene in Eddie's room,  when the camera takes in all the posters on the wall is obviously taken  from ""Saturday Night Fever"", right down to the same type of  pictures: Farrah Fawcett, Bruce Lee, and Pacino as ""Serpico"".",963187200,,2441,4.764423076923077

Burt Reynolds plays well but all the fuzz about his  coming-back is a little bit overdone. But I believe that is common in the  USA. The tag on the video of 18 years and over is for Europe overdone.

As time goes on, my list  slowly increases thanks to films like this. Boogie Nights is perfect. It is  perfect in its portrayal of the vapidness of porn actors, it puts together  an ensemble cast that meshes perfectly. And unlike stiffs like 54, and the  Last Days of Disco, this is one movie that actually nails the feel of the  70's perfectly. It would have been so easy for director Anderson to slap  some 70's tunes together, get some clothes from the thrift store, and call  this a 70's homage, but he doesn't do that. Being somewhat a music  afficienado, he faithfully researched what music belonged to what period of  time. This may seem insignificant, but it is indicitive of his great  attention to detail. There are too many great film moments to mention, but  I'll take a stab at it,since this review is designed to enlighten. Listen  closely to the conversations of some of the minor characters as well as  partygoers for some of the funniest, most stupid and senseless small talk  one would expect from high school drop out porn stars. Watch Renolyds  reaction to the colonel when he speaks with him in jail and he asks him if  he's still his friend. Renolyds also shines when it comes to his retticence  to move from film making to video making. There's also Julianne Moore's  cocaine fueled plans for her life which you immediatlly know will never  come to fruition. And there's Wahlbergs expression that is priceless when he  is sitting on the couch of a local drug dealer who has a penchant for guns  and fireworks. By facial expressions alone, you can see wahlberg examining  his life,confused at first, a hint of a smile when he thinks about his  x-rated career, and then his look of disqust as he realizes how far he's  sunk. The scene takes all of about 5-10 seconds, but is classic! The whole  movie is a classic! I cannot emphasize how great this movie is!",959299200,,1999,4.544943820224719

Director Paul Thomas Anderson paints a very human picture  that happens to be about the industry of ""porno movies"". In this  film, not only is the era and pulse of the 70's perfectly reproduced but  Burt Reynolds, who portrays director Jack Horner and surrogate father to  Dirk (Mark Wahlberg) and Rollergirl ( the most fitting character in a 70's  movie played by Heather Graham) delivers a more stunning and captivating  performance than he ever did in his very own decade known also as...

Dirk gets famous immediately thanks to his gift. Success comes and he  grants it, he buys him a own house, a fast car and people wants to be his  friend. As anybody know, success can have its downside, and cocaine is its  name. Eddie becomes a egoistic superstar who starts to avoid his new  family. And after a row with Jack, very similar to the first fight, he gets  fired and leaves.
That's the story of Boogie Nights, a very deep movie  that deals with pornography and family values. I find it sometimes  disturbing to look at, because of its abuse. We see people abuse drugs,  people who abuse their friendships and people who abuse theirselves. The  language is foul because of its matter, which is fair enough. But what I  learned is that we all need love from each other. And with egoism and  paranoia, we can seriously damage that. It's about having a second chance.  And granting one too.
The best way to see Boogie Nights is on DVD. It has  a full-length commentary by its director, Paul Thomas Anderson. He sure has  a foul language but the commentary is informative and funny. There's a  music video by Michael Penn directed by the same director. And nine  wonderful deleted scenes with or without director commentary.

1352318,5,B00004TQF7,"I never thought I would enjoy a film about the life and times of an exceptionally endowed porn star. Then I happened to tune in to ""Boogie Nights"" on cable, and was hooked -- mostly by the superb performances  of Mark Wahlberg, Burt Reynolds, and Julianne Moore (not to mention  excellent work by most of the supporting cast, but also by the quality of  the directing.  The film, at times hilariously funny and at other times  heartbreakingly sad, succeeds as an epic portrait of a marginal segment of  society that, in a way, represented its era.
A few minor quibbles.  I  thought it wasn't entirely credible that after ""Dirk"" was fired,  he'd be reduced to selling himself on the streets in just a year.  He must  have made a lot of money in the five years when he was a big star -- could  he really have blown it all on coke in such a short time?  (That said, the  scene where he's picked up by the gay-basher pretending to be a customer  was oustanding; Dirk's desperation and sense of how low he had fallen were  made painfully real.)  I also didn't care for the shootout in the donut  shop -- gratuitously gory, and a little too ""neat"" a way for Buck  to have a ""happy ending"" by finding the money he needed for the  stereo store.
Other than that, virtually everything in the film was  on-target.  Burt Reynolds had just the right mix of fatherly kindness,  terrifying anger when his ""alpha male"" status was threatened, and  amusing pomposity in his pretensions to be a ""real"" filmmaker.  Julianne Moore made Amber a person who is genuinely warm but also quite  screwed up (the scene where she introduces Dirk to coke-sniffing right  after telling him that she sees him as a son was very emblematic of that).  And Mark Wahlberg did an Oscar-worthy job of conveying Eddie/Dirk's  essential sweetness and naivete, then his gradual transformation into an  arrogant, paranoid and still essentially juvenile cokehead, and his despair  and vulnerability as he hits rock bottom.
Anderson does not pass  heavy-handed judgment on his characters but there are a lot of subtle  touches showing the destructive side of their lifestyle -- while remaining  sympathetic to them as human beings.

Here we have a look at the late 70-early 80 period through  the glasses of a group of american porno related persons. The force of  BOOGIE NIGHTS is that this description, through this microcosm, allows us  to feel an epoch in its ensemble. That's the sign of a great movie.
One  of the most interesting ideas of this movie is to have taken Jack's house  as the nest where all the characters return and where all the personal  stories begin. The first time we enter this house, we see only three rooms,  the next time four, and so on.

Mostly I wanted to comment on the DVD features in particular the  commentary by the director. For the most part, the director/writer explains  why he chose certain actors, props, dialogue, and scenes by comparing it to  his own life experiences. The most often used explanation was ""I saw  it/him/her somewhere once and I liked it so I put it in the movie.""  This didn't explain a lot though. To his credit, he does get better as the  movie progresses, as you find out in the credits, he was probably drinking  and has a little drunk by the end. The deleting scenes also with commentary  were excellent and I though a few of them should have remained. The music  video is surprisingly good and it has you saying, ""How did he do  that?""

But everything ""Boogie  Nights"" offers you everything in a movie that a film buff wants to  see. It denies conventions and ideal character development, story lines or  editing. It is relentlessly original and non-stop. It is an opus, an opera,  throwing together a close knit family of porn movie makers in the late  seventies and early eighties and they interact with each other, affecting  theirs and each others lives in ways that only can be determined by staying  put through the course of the movie. I will not recommend ""Boogie  Nights"" to a person who has ever dismissed a film simply on the basis  that it is too uncoventional or too profane, because indeed, ""Boogie  Nights"" is unconventional and profane. But you can't dwell on that,  and if you usually do, then don't see it. But if you can simply sit down  and let a movie affect you in whatever way it will and accept a movie for  what it is, not what you hoped it would be, then it might be perfect for  you.

Dirk Diggler, the character played by Mark Wahlburg (who  shows that he really has become an actor) was based off of an actual fallen  porn star.

Third, the  dialouge in the film is the reason it makes the actors look so damn good.  Scenes like when Buck is talking to Jessie about sunsets, when Dirk flips  out because they won't shoot the scene, Jack's monolouge about film-making  in the resteraunt, and Amber tries to get joint custody of her soon.

The dynamic between Moore and Reynolds is the best  performance as far as performance, but this isn't a film that relies on a  strong individual effort.  The real character is Anderson's script, where  everyone gets a classic Greek treatment: a rise to reknown, be it fast,  slow or otherwise; a sharp fall, so sharp in fact it appears all can be  lost; and a return to former glory with aknowledge of loss that makes said  character reflective and a little less ignorant.
At the risk of being  long-winded, I will strongly reccommend this DVD (commentary, deleted  scenes, and a ton of Phase 2 stuff) for any avid movie fan that wishes to  see one Valley boy's unifying, familial, redemptive masterpiece.

Throughout the movie, Anderson also  manages to squeeze in poetic vignettes that take the viewer out of the  mad-dash-to-get-to-the-third-act method that is so prevalent in Hollywood  narratives.  These moments he provides include Philip Seymour Hoffman's  self-hatred, Julianne Moore's distress, and Don Cheadle's moment in the  donut shop.  Please note that although the Hollywood Reporter classified  this film as a 'comedy', to me it's more of a tragedy, but it's definitely  an all-round drama, comparable in tone to a Goodfellas or Casino.",947116800,,793,5.471074380165289

Burt Reynolds could have easily won an Oscar for his great performance as a  porn-director with visions of someday making his opus.  The ensemble cast  is great: especially Don Cheadle, William H.

The  beginning of the film is literally thrilling, with the screen exploding  into colors and the powerful, touching and terrific song Best of my Love  underlining the whole scene. Of course, you may already know that Boogie  Nights is a great movie, if it wasn't it wouldn't have gone to the Oscar  night. The story is courageous and shocking, about Jack Horner,a porn  director who  turns Eddie, a boy ,into a movie star. The seventies, a  happy, funny and delicious time, suddenly gives place to the eighties, and  things begin to go wrong, and Jack , Eddie and their friends start to get  in touch with the first signs of decadence. Wahlberg is great, he proves  that he is a good actor, Anderson will be the next  Scorcese, he has full  domain over filming techniques, and his talent is more than shown here. He  creates scenes that deserve to be included in the great moments of cinema  history. The biggest surprise in this porn saga is in fact just one man, a  guy who once was the biggest name in Hollywood, an actor who was destinated  to the end, his name is Burt Reynolds. I always thought that Burt Reynolds  was in his way out, and Hollywood wouldn't even remember his importance in  the past. Maybe Tarantino could remember him, but I was sure that he was in  his way out. But in this movie the man returns and delivers the greatest  performance of all time, and I am sincere in my opinion, Reynolds gave one  unforgetable performance, with authority, charm and talent! his presence is  the screen is striking, and his breakthrough role made Hollywood understand  that no one after him stood above the top of the box office for so many  years in a row, it made Hollywood understand the importance of this  talented and beloved movie star. And now he is in his way back, and, boy,  his next project is going to be very talked about: you will soon hear about  a thriller called The Crew.

First of all, Boogie Nights  is an amazing movie.  I consider this one of my favorite movies of all  time, and I appreciate it more with each viewing. Paul Thomas Anderson has  crafted a mesmerizing view of the 70's porn industry that focuses on many  different fascinating characters.  Anderson pulls solid performances from  all the actors--most notably Mark Whalberg (who deserved an Oscar for this  work) Julianne Moore, Heather Graham, and Burt Reynolds.  But, really, all  of the actors involved did a great job.  This truly is the work of an  ensemble.
This movie can be dark, though there are a few glimmers of  light to be found within.  Anyone who loves a movie about people and their  lives will find Boogie Nights a wise purchase.  Moreover, this is a movie  that needs to be owned--for you will want to watch it again and  again.

1352350,5,B00004TQF7,"Mark Wahlberg deftly guides himself through this mesmerizing epic about a tight-knit porn ""family"" in the 1977 San Fernando Valley. As Eddie Adams, he is approached by adult filmmaker Jack Horner (Burt  Reynolds, in one of the most subtle and finest performances of his career)  while washing dishes at a swanky Reseda disco nightclub. He proves a  success as ""Dirk Diggler"" on the tarnished screen of pornography,  though several missteps fueled by egoism lead ultimately to his downfall.  Director Paul Thomas Anderson borrowed heavily from numerous directors in  his filming techniques, though the DVD's director's commentary segment  inexplicably doesn't mention Martin Scorsese. From the opening nightclub  sequence that closely mirrors the infamous ""And Then He Kissed  Me"" sequence in GoodFellas to skillfully quick and flashy edits (not  to mention the familiar though well-played anchor storyline of an ambitious  kid done in by stupidity and drugs), Anderson certainly borrows (though  honorably) Scorsese's epic storytelling technique, especially involving  subject matter about which most viewers seem outwardly skiddish. Wahlberg's  performance is a tour-de-force, as is Reynolds'. Julianne Moore skillfully  pitches in as the maternal porn queen Amber Waves, and amusing side  characters are completed in a glittering ensemble cast that includes  Heather Graham, William H. Macy, Don Cheadle, and John C. Reilly. The  10-minute ""Sister Christian"" drug scene near the conclusion of  the film featuring a wigged-out Alfred Molina is not to be missed. Although  John C. Reilly's face does not need to be seen in the corner of the screen  as Dirk spaces out for 30 seconds during ""Jessie's Girl"". Watch  the film in full frame, and see the difference. Superb performances and  swift pacing make this 135-minute film move just a bit faster, and artful  directing make the racy and often hilarious story one of the best movies of  the decade.",935884800,,1950,5.42
1352351,4,B00004TQF7,"The critics who put this movie in a ""Best-of-all-time"" list probably got seduced by all the patchwork trends of the '90s.
Boogie Nights is an interesting, occasionally sloppy, generally sympathetic movie  with distinct flaws.  Though these flaws don't destroy the whole, it is  nowhere close to being a classic of Citizen Kane proportions, though  stylistically it reflects (and, I would argue, is symptomatic of) the '90s  style of postmodern filmmaking.
Like most '90s films and especially  indies, this movie suffers from too quirky a narrative flow and show-offy  techniques.  Its most grievous problem is a generic one -- writer/director  P.T. Anderson, by trying to evoke too many movies that he seems to love  (or, in the worst-case scenario, by trying to dog after the Tarantino  approach to filmmaking), creates tonal conflicts in his movie that don't  fit the story at all.  For example, to chronicle Dirk Diggler's decline, he  stages a ridiculous drug-dealing sequence complete with John Woo-style  double-pistol action.  Compared with the gentle and moving account of the  Don Cheadle character's decline (unable to get a bank loan because he was a  porn star), this sequence is garbage indeed.  (I'm as big a fan of John Woo  as anybody, but there are times to use the Woo imagery and techniques, and  this wasn't one of them.)  The actors are great to watch, of course -- when  you get Julianne Moore, Heather Graham, William H. Macy, Don Cheadle, Burt  Reynolds...and a well cast Mark Wahlberg in a movie, it'd take a lot to  spoil the characterization, and Anderson, for all his faults, isn't quite  that atrocious to ruin it for his actors.
So in the end Boogie Nights is  an overlong though sharply observed comment on pornography and growing up  in the '70s.  Defiantly unusual -- and like many other films that dare to  take risks, it stumbles.  They're noble failures, however.  Once Anderson  reconciles his sense of adventure in filmmaking with coherence of tone and  narrative flow, he'll achieve a true dialogue with his Muse.  On Boogie  Nights, he's shouting to be heard.",929491200,,2099,5.0
1352352,5,B00004TQF7,"I have seen this film probably about ten times now, and never get sick of it. It is full of comedy, darkness and deep scenes.
The story centers around a young, idiotic, but sensitive and friendly kid, Eddie, who is  discovered in a resturaunt kitchen -- well, at least his ""talent""  is, anyway. Once he makes the cut with Jack Horner (played by Burt  Reynolds, who delivers a great performance) and his film-making crew, he  becomes a hot porn personality, under the pseudonym DIRK DIGGLER. Dirk  rises up to stardom, only to have everything destroyed by drugs. This film,  based (loosely) upon the rise and fall of John ""Johnny Wadd""  Holmes, focuses on drugs destroying the life and innocence of a  soft-hearted kid, and his sad struggle to overcome it.
Even the slow  parts in this film are interesting. But don't get me wrong, ""BOOGIE  NIGHTS"" is almost never uplifting, and it shouldn't be. It is  depressing at times, and shows you the harsh reality of drugs -- it aint  cool, and it definately aint fun....which the main characters soon discover  as the 70's become the 80's...but don't have the luxury of choosing to end  their addictions. In fact, if I didn't know any better, I'd say this is a  statement on drugs and the porn industry.
Let's not forget the  acting...which was superb. Mark Wahlberg is most impressive, as is the rest  of the cast. They are flawless. And you really feel for and like the  characters.
This isn't just an intense and rediculously wild piece of  filmaking (like Pulp Fiction) -- it is a  dark look at a way of life.

The film's turning point, a 1980 New Year's Day  suicide, gives us a final glimpse of Dirk and the industry before drugs and  videotape run their courses. Anderson's character explorations are amazing,  showing the anger of Jack Horner and the changes that Dirk goes through,  the maternal instincts of Amber Waves, and the airheadedness of Rollergirl,  before whose beauty and capital knockers all men bow.

I consider Gone With the Wind and Sunset Boulevard to be the two greatest  films ever made - Boogie Nights goes in the top 10 though.  Talk about  great dialogue and great acting.  It is terribly funny without poking fun  at its characters.  Yes! We really did dress, talk, dance, and act that way  back in the 70's.  It's like looking into a window through time.  I really  think this movie is top notch.  I look forward to anything that Anderson  directs in the future.",920419200,,607,4.542056074766355
1352359,5,B00004TQF7,"When I first went to see this movie I was quite dubious. I wasn't too happy to be 'paying' to see a movie about the porn industry (Not my favourite subject matter) with Mark Walhberg and Burt Reynolds who weren't  two of my favourite actors at the time but all that has changed I was  suprised to see it was an Excellent film. This isn't solely about the porn  industury this is about the people behind it and their lives. Mark Walhberg  is suberb and Burt Reynolds is at one of his best, the rest (Julianne  Moore, Heather Graham, John C. Reilly and many others) hold their own  respectivily. The opening scene at a nightclub which is just one long cut  is excellent veiwing and one powerful emotionally raw scene where Dirk  (Eddie at the time) gets thrown out of home with only the clothes he's  wearing on  his back makes for good veiwing. All in all it's a excellent  film and is well worth the watch. A DVD extra is a commentary from the  director. If you ask me this should have swept the Oscars, instead of  silly, stupid no-story Titanic. This film focuses on 'real' people's  feelings instead of special effects. But even so you don't need a few gold  statues to say whether this a good film or not this is excellent with  Oscars or without",912124800,,1250,4.393013100436681
1352360,5,B00004TQF7,"This really isn't a movie about the porn business; its a movie about  people. And what people... and what a movie! An outstanding film in  every sense: acting, cinematography, writing, directing, music, and  implementation on DVD. The full-length director commentary is a must-hear  and adds greatly to the enjoyment of the film's second viewing. The image  transfer and 5.1 digital soundtrack are superior on this RSDL (dual-layer)  disc. Featuring what is without a doubt the pinnacle performance of  Burt Reynold's career and proving that Mark Wahlberg is a serious actor  capable of working in any genre, Boogie Nights is a carefully crafted work  of art that belongs in your permanent collection of DVDs.

Not only is it as good a movie, it's a similar tale of characters mired in their own sleaze and desperately seeking their own redemption. One of my favorites.",1526256000,,323,4.684210526315789
