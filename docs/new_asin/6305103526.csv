I hope someday The life and times of Grizzly Adams comes digitally remastered.",1350172800,2,158,5.36
970429,5,6305103526,"If you teach symbols of the United States, this is a
wonderful movie about the bald eagle.  It combines facts
about the bald eagle with Native American culture (dancing).
It's a great supplement to any curriculum and captures the
attention of the young viewer for the entire movie.",1270512000,,281,4.854166666666667

970432,5,6305103526,"Okay, so the reason I bought this movie in the first place was because William Smith was in it and I would watch him in almost anything.  But I was pleasantly surprised, this is a beautiful movie, the scenery is gorgeous (as Haggerty says ""only God can paint a picture like this"");  so are the animals.  The story is about a cartographer (Dan Haggerty) hired by the Army Corp of Engineers to map out the great uncharted northwest territory.  He, of course, is friend to all the animals and in particular to a golden eagle who has the skills of Lassie for tracking and fetching help when needed.  Haggerty's son, who has been staying with an aunt after the death of his mother, joins him in the wilderness and parts of the story are told through narration as though the son is an older man recounting tales of his father and their journeys together.  Smith (he's so good at playing the villain) is a one-eyed river pirate seeking revenge against Haggerty for the loss of his eye.  Classic good guys versus bad guys; and of course the good guy wins.  Breathtaking scenery, beautiful horses, amazing animals, noble Indians, the good guys win--what else could you want?  The question I always like to ask someone else is ""having seen it, would you buy it again"" and in this case my answer is a resounding yes.",1235779200,9,1305,4.542735042735043
970433,4,6305103526,"If you believe that man should try to live in harmony with nature or you enjoyed Dan Haggerty's TV series ""Grizzley Adams"" or his movies you should definitely catch this one. Very entertaining movie about a surveyor in the old west. It give us a glimpse of living in the wild with nature and animals, French boatmen, river pirates, native americans, and wilderness settlements. Personally I love the things that Haggerty and the people making his movies try to convey. They try to educate us about another time but also that good ideas never die. I was also glad to see Don Shanks again. Here he plays Running Wolf, and although him and Haggerty's character don't see eye to eye, they respect each other. Don is a fine actor and not given enough roles as far as I'm concerned. Good quality DVD with good replayability.",1206921600,20,818,4.6482758620689655
970434,5,6305103526,I have loved this movie since I was a kid.  Beautiful footage of the eagles is great with an adventurous plot line.  Great for slightly older kids.,1167264000,14,147,4.407407407407407
970435,2,6305103526,"I borrowed this from the library some time back, and was VERY unimpressed by the 'story' this all goes by (The 'kid who was picked on but is confident in the end.' type deal.) and it has a small bit of misinformation. The one redeeming factor of this video is that it does have some exceptional footage of bald eagles, which is only slightly inturrupted by the little kids' wowing over it.",975628800,5,389,4.416666666666667

970548,4,6305103526,"Spirit Of The Eagle, from 1991, is more of a throwback to this type of movie made in the 1970's. The scenery is amazing and the plot, about a villainous fur trader versus a cartographer with an affinity for befriending the wild animals, most especially a beautiful eagle and his young son, a wannabe daring adventurer, is a joy to watch.

Trevor Yarrish does an affable job as the young Eli while Dan Haggerty, in all his Nestea lovin, grizzly adams bearded folksy good natured-ness, is terrific as Big Eli. Jeri Arredondo is superb as a Native American girl who befriends the two Eli's when the dirty trader nicknamed Hatchett (played to perfection by the always perfect bad guy William Smith) trades the boy for two horses.

Eventually, in a plot device we all see coming, Smith shoots Lady, the beautiful eagle out of the sky and it's up to the two Eli's to mend her busted wing so she has a chance to fly again.

There are some moments where the acting comes up a little contrived and there are other missteps here and there, but if you're looking for a bit of a history lesson on what this land was like in the 1880s, and you love an adventure with breathtaking scenery, it's hard to do better than Spirit of The Eagle. 4.5 stars",1406937600,2,1234,4.451327433628318

970642,4,6305103526,"I am a big Dan Haggerty fan from his days on Grizzly Adams.  While this movie is good and cute, it is much more geared towards kids.  That being said, adults would find it easy to watch as well.  Some of the story is a bit cheesy, but overall it is worth watching.",1381104000,3,264,3.943396226415094
