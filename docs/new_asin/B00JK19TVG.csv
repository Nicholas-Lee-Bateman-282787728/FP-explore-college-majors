Is the industry purposely releasing crappy 3D to wean us from desiring to buy such EXPENSIVE films? This is HORRIBLE 3D. Almost as crappy as the 3D TV's version of push the remote button to change 2D image into 3D. Foolish for the industry to even give the ability to do that with the remote....it is a FALSE image of 3D. Many of the tones & colors will 3D in your face fine, however the blacks are like cookie cutter drop outs. Can cause head ache watching trashy 3D. The story is simple and the CGI very minimal. This is a production a Sophomore TEAM in college could put out. Very beginner quality with good intentions to enter the market, but THIS film never should have been sold to a mass public. This kind of crappy 3D gives the technology a BAD reputation. Shame",1520294400,,857,4.3625
