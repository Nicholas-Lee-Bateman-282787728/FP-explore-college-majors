1520542,5,B00005JNLQ,"Bill Murray has really impressed me with his more recent roles; not that his performance in ""Ghostbusters"" or ""Groundhog Day"" weren't good, it's just that he's so great in ""Lost In Translation"" and now ""the Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" that he has become one of my favorite actors.

Now as for the director, Wes Anderson; he's obviously a very talented guy as well.  First, ""Rushmore"", then ""the Royal Tenenbaums"", and now this.  ""The Life Aquatic"" had me laughing hysterically at parts; Anderson has a knack for making things funny that normally wouldn't seem funny.  The movie also contains numerous sea animals created with claymation that add a touch of humor to the film.  Willem Defoe and Jeff Goldblum really play their parts well and add quality to an already good movie.  Owen Wilson and Cate Blanchett aren't shabby actors either.  All in all, everyone involved in this project did a fine job and the results are an underwater adventure/comedy/drama film worth adding to your DVD collection.",1111622400,6,1004,4.976047904191617
1520543,4,B00005JNLQ,"Whether it's a character study in midlife detachment or a nudge-nudge-wink-wink take on cheesy 70s style Jacques Cousteau productions, The Life Aquatic never makes a pretense of being anything less than kooky.

Yet, for all its ostensible insincerity, it never comes across as an attempt to play us cheaply. We keep watching because it's hard to keep a straight face at the sight of Zissous Inc. The 'jokes' are sporadic and borderline moronic but thankfully punctuated frequently by Anderson's trademark brilliance in the script.

Rushmore's success hinged on the depth of its protagonist and how much we ended up rooting for him. That's the beauty of our good marine folk in Aquatic, spotlighted without a tangible spinal plot.

An ageing Bill Murray is Zissou, no one else in the whole industry can embody deadpan irony with such gumption. The rest of the zany crew includes several A-listers, each accorded a hint of a subplot: an allegedly long-lost illegitimate son (Owen Wilson); a pregnant journalist, whose baby will be ""eleven and a half in twelve years"", shuttling her cautious affections between father and son (Cate Blanchett); a funny German sidekick who craves to be on the ""A Team"" (William Dafoe in a most unusual role); an estranged yet oddly supportive vamp of a wife (Angelina Houston); a beleagured research rival (Jeff Goldblum). There's even a band of Filipino pirates.

Best of show however belongs to a swarm of beguilingly nonsensical candy-colored sea critters (very vivid CGI there) and the grand finale aboard a peculiar underwater stealth pod.

Mind you, it's all a jaunty departure from the mainstream so if you expecting a film with clearcut introduction-body-conclusion and overt jokes of the Something About Mary variety, you're in for disappointment. Hence the 4 stars.

But if you can handle a refreshing loaf from the lives of highly irregular folk, buttered with hints of amusing dialogue, then I recommend this oddity in a blink.",1111190400,39,1968,5.1152647975077885
1520544,5,B00005JNLQ,"... but I hope he sticks around a lot more! If you half-liked ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" or even underwater nature programs from the 1970s or the new movie ""Sideways"" then you will absolutely love The Life Aquatic, quite possibly many of you will commend this motion picture comedy family drama as the best movie ever, others saying that you have not seen such a good movie in a very long time, and I would not hesitate to agree with any of that, especially if you fit into the above niche, chances then are that you are going to be running back for a second screening and wondering in bed at night when the DVD is going to come out, the 2005 race starts right here (okay maybe ""Sideways"" was way too good, but this also!), and maybe, who knows, this one just might kick buttt all the way into the next year, so make sure you try and get to see it now, rather than after all the hype, as it plays out very well in an audience type situation meaning that this is a GREAT CINEMA outing; even the opening scene suggesting that we should be watching the marine documentary clips like the start of a newsreel before the movie, here The Life Aquatic is all about rehashing the life and times of underwater ocean explorer Jacque Cousteau, who was a womaniser, thief, tax evader, you name it, this `diver' was the protge of rip-off investigative reporting exploiting whatever he could, and did, creating documentaries so bent from the reality of the situation that National Geographic later decided to `storyboard' all their future episodes, a practice that still goes on to this day, if you liked ""Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind"" then it is along that same path, a lot less adult than ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and certainly eons more cute and cuddly, and extremely funny, the ending all round feel good, the credits done ""Jackie Brown"" style, Wes Anderson is like Ken Russell just hijacked the American new wave comedy scene, this is thoroughly an innovative type of retro-comedy `motion picture film', that can stand heads above the likes of any Ben Stiller `movie', it would be a shame to say that Bill Murray is why we watch it, the casting here is some of the best you have ever seen, right down to the student intern bit part fodder crew members, go see this and try not to read much about it before you do. The premise is this: This is the biography of Jackque Cousteau as you would like to see Hollywood do it! It is a scream! Well done Wes Anderson!",1111190400,10,2451,4.485458612975392
1520545,5,B00005JNLQ,"To be quite honest, I have yet to see this film.  However, Criterion, the ""rolls royce of DVD's"", which, for those in the know is certainly true, are releasing a 2-Disc edition of this.  Even if the film is not all that great, which may or may not be true, is irrelavant now since Criterion has put together a great package.  ROCK ON CRITERION!",1109721600,4,344,4.34375
1520546,5,B00005JNLQ,"The scene where they play ""staraful"" (by sigur ros) may be my favorite scene in a movie ever. I think wes anderson puts music into his films better than any other director.

  I heard the sigur ros song a week or so before and i thought it was great and all but didn't really get it. Then once i saw that scene i was just like ""now i get it"". I cant put into words how amazing that scene was. Wes anderson shows that tragic and messed up things in life can be beutiful.",1109635200,4,469,3.9680851063829787
1520547,4,B00005JNLQ,"I am an Anderson fan, but with all his movies I usually have to watch them a second time before I fully appreciate them.  He shoves so much stuff (character wise, dialogue wise, visually and so on) that you miss so much on the first viewing.  Tenenbaums is the only that worked for me the first time around fully, but amazingly the next few times I watched it I still got more out of it.  I am figuring the same will happen with Life Aquatic.

Murray plays as oceanographer Steve Zissou, a Cousteau-like filmmaker who goes in search of the jaguar shark who killed his friend, taking along a crew of eccentrics, including his ""maybe-son"" Ned (Owen Wilson).  In all honesty the jaguar shark isn't important, it's really just an excuse for Zissou to get through a mid-life crisis he is currently experiencing, triggered by the fact many people think he is now a hack filmmaker.  He hopes finding and killing the shark (sticking dynamite up an uncomfortable place is the plan) and catching it on film, as well as a possible father/son subplot, will return him to his former glory.

Those expecting a ""wacky adventure"" about the search of the shark may be disappointed.  That's not to say wacky and odd things don't happen (they definitely do, ranging from budget problems to pirates) but the film is more character driven than plot driven (as I said before the shark isn't important, just a driving device, a sort of ""McGuffin"") and that may throw off some.

Upon first seeing it I was a tad disappointed, but thinking about it I'm gaining more of an appreciation for it (I can't wait to watch it again on Criterion DVD).  I think I was a tad disappointed that the sub characters weren't really developed but that is beside the point really as I think about it.  It's about Zissou and that's it, it's his story and the change that occurs is what the movie is really about.  People who watch it as a revenge movie will definitely be disappointed by the end, but as long as you realize it's a story about Steve (not the shark) the ending is quite effective, and sort of sad.

The movie is quite funny, but not as funny as Tenenbaums (maybe a second viewing will help there because Tenenbaums definitely got funnier with each viewing).  The humour is pretty dry and subtle.  Some of it revolves around the fact Steve really doesn't know much about the subject he's covering, the cheapness of his productions, odd sub characters (Dafoe is a riot as the ""calm, collected, German"" right hand man, Klaus) and his movies in general (the few we see are funny just because of how obviously staged they are, and I laughed my ass off at the one where they apparently found a thought to be extinct species because it was so phony).  There are a lot of throw away jokes as well, some great movie-making gags, and the scenes involving the pirates boarding, a raid on an island and another in Goldblum's lab were some of the funniest things I saw last year.  While the film did get incredibly silly at times, I at least had a smile on my face.

Anderson does direct it almost in a documentary style (though with his usual anal framing of having everything centered and in shot), some of the action scenes come off haphazard but it just conveys that documentary feel.  Some people have speculated that you are actually watching Zissou's finished film, making this movie a ""movie-within-a-movie"".  And while there are some things that would suggest that (including a surprise during the end credits, and the fact the gunshots sound like pop guns, and the alread mentioned odd but funny action sequences) I somehow doubt Anderson would go that route, as the movie would lose some of the effectiveness of the character arc that occurs.

The sea creatures are cool, stop-motion animated by Henry Selik, who did The Nightmare Before Christmas.  It adds a fantasy element that all Anderson films have

I had some problems that may change on repeat viewings.  I found the second half hour felt very off in terms of pacing.  The first half hour is funny and goes by fast, but then the second half hour almost stops.  His movies are never quick but they do move at a good pace and they work for me.  Thankfully at the midway point (or around there) it picks up again.  As well, as I also mentioned, I was disappointed it wasn't as funny as I would have hoped, but it might get funnier on repeat viewings now that I know the characters more (the same happened with Anderson's other films for me).  I laughed quite a bit, some sequences rather hard, but after Tenenbaums I may have been expecting more.  Sometimes it just comes off more silly than truly funny.

I do have to watch it again, though.  Thinking about it I like it a lot more than I originally did, but it's a film I'm sure that requires a few viewings (even cast members such as Huston and Murray had to watch it a few times before it fully made sense, Murray said this on Letterman, to which the audience laughed, but he wasn't kidding.)  So much is going on that I know I missed some things.  Anderson's attention to detail is incredible and it makes repeat viewings worthwhile.

I know many will hate it on first viewing because I know many like things handed to them and that they don't have to think about it afterwards (and chances are to get the full effect you will have to watch it again).  I know people have trouble with character driven films, and films that do require concentration and your attention, but if you make the effort you'll definitely get something out of it.  This movie doesn't hand anything to you (even the jokes require your attention) and it does require your participation.  It is an odd and quirky film, just a little off of reality, but it does have a heart.

My opinion might change on it after I get the DVD and watch it and the supplements (I'll either like it more, or dislike it more) but as of now I think it was an unfairly overlooked film that people weren't expecting.  It might find a good audience, though.  Despite the fact I know people hated it, it's the first Anderson movie I saw in the theater where the majority of people were laughing, and my wife (who doesn't like Anderson's other films) actually liked it as well.  Maybe it will find its audience on DVD.",1109376000,5,6243,4.527629233511586
1520548,4,B00005JNLQ,"Wes Anderson has had a sterling track record up until now: the hilarious ""Bottle Rocket,"" pensive ""Rushmore"" and darkly funny ""Royal Tenenbaums."" With ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou,"" he's not quite in top form. The movie is far from bad -- the cast is sterling, and Anderson's style is intact -- but it isn't quite as good as his past work.

Steve Zissou (Billy Murray) is a Jacques Cousteau-like marine biologist and explorer, who seems to be baffled by his own species. After the premiere of his newest documentary, Zissou informs the crowd that he intends to get revenge on the legendary Jaguar Shark that devoured his friend. Why? Revenge. So he starts cobbling together a new expedition.

Among the odd ducks who join the expedition are Ned (Owen Wilson) who believes Zissou is his father, a pregnant British journalist (Cate Blanchett) and an emotionally insecure German (Willem Dafoe). Ned and Zissou try to work out their odd relationship as their whimsical Moby Dick quest starts zoning in on the Jaguar Shark.

""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" has an intriguing beginning and a glorious finale. The middle just lacks a bit of the necessary meat -- it needs a bit more than a whimsical Ahab quest to keep it moving. But Anderson makes up for storytelling gaps, by using his unique style and the quirky talents of his actors. I didn't know Dafoe -- also known as the Green Goblin -- was so darn funny.

Actually, the whole idea of the movie is pretty intriguing -- Jacques Cousteau with Ahab's revenge thang. And Anderson takes his cinematic quirks and turns them on ""high."" Dancing fish, Porteguese covers of David Bowie, and pirate attacks take place, surrounded by colorful costumes and impossibly bright settings. The sea never looked so blue. And rarely has comedy been as dry and quirky.

And Anderson also fills the gaps with his unique way of conveying... well, the best term is deadpan emotion. It kicks off with ""I'm going to go on an overnight drunk, and in 10 days I'm going to set out to find the shark that ate my friend and destroy it,"" and proceeds with a mixture of comedy and pathos, lurking just under the surface. Nobody bursts into tears or howls with rage -- Anderson prefers to just let the actors take over their characters. The only problem with this is that sometimes he tries to cover the overstretched plot parts with it.

Bill Murray is at his best when he plays quirky, deadpan men, and he does an excellent job with Zissou. Zissou is, like Royal Tenenbaum, an aging child-man who is stubborn, insensitive, and very clueless. Somehow, possibly because of Murray's acting charm, he's likable. Wilson restrains his goofball comedy for a more poignant role, and the supporting cast -- especially the outstanding Dafoe and the wonderful Blanchett -- are also quite solid.

""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" suffers from too little plot in some places. But don't forget, Wes Anderson at his worst moments still swims far above the average director -- and so does the movie.",1109030400,3,3019,4.7831094049904035
1520549,3,B00005JNLQ,"Bill Murray (Lost In Translation, Ghostbusters) stars as Captain Steve Zissou..who suffers a loss when his best friend, played by Seymour Cassel (The Crew, The Royal Tenenbaums) dies from the deadly Jaguar Shark...so Murray announces he will go on a revenge quest to kill it but he cant but he goes on it anyway taking in a new member for the team, Ned, played by Owen Wilson (Zoolander, Meet The Fockers). Murray finds out Wilson might be his son...they don't know. So, the crew goes on a crazy ass adventure getting into insane situations, one involving them going on a rescue mission to get a captured friend. Like I said its crazy and insane but hey, its Wes Anderson, so what do you expect. Murray is funny as hell, Wilson is right there with him and Willem Dafoe (The Aviator, Spider-man) is a scream who resembles Jacques Castoe in a way. Also starring Anjelica Houston (The Royal Tenenbaums, The Addams Family), Michael Gambon (Harry Potter and The Prisoner Of Azkaban), Bud Cort (Dogma), Jeff Goldblum (Igby Goes Down, The Big Chill) and Cate Blanchett (The Aviator, The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy). It's not Anderson's best but it's very entertaining and the acting is dead on.",1108944000,,1186,4.762135922330097
1520550,5,B00005JNLQ,"Perhaps, as a die-hard Wes Anderson fan, I am a little biased. I went into the theater to see ""The Life Aquatic"" with only the highest of expectations, and Anderson delivered as wonderfully as he did with his first three films.

While I agree that the plot could have used a bit more meat in the middle [I would have liked to have gotten a bit more into why Zissou hated fathers, and other points that were brought up but not so much developed], there was a fabulous beginning and a triumphant ending. The music, like with all of Anderson's films, is as vital as the script and scenery themselves; you cannot argue that the use of Sigur Ros' ""Staralfur"" in the jaguar shark scene is not terribly moving, or that David Bowie's ""Life On Mars?"" while Zissou walks out to smoke on the helm doesn't provide a dramatic backdrop for the scene. Also, the Seu Jorge covers of Bowie songs set a delightful undertone to the film, with each song playing rather strategically during key scenes, and the use of Portuguese lyrics rather than the original English serves a metaphoric purpose, as well as being just plain lovely. The stop-action animation of all the marine life added to the whimsical feel of the underwater scenes. The actors all carry out their roles wonderfully -- even the menial crew members perform to their highest ability [especially Willem Dafoe, Noah Taylor, and Seu Jorge] -- and Bill Murray, the essential actor in an Anderson film, delivers a stunning performance.

So yes, I have already preordered my ""Life Aquatic,"" as it would be remiss not to, being such an obsessor of Anderson's work. But for someone who is perhaps not so ""into it"" [read, someone who is looking for Bill Murray in a comic role, or someone who is just looking to be entertained for an evening and not educated or enlightened], I would rent it before buying it, and watch it a few times. Anderson's films sometimes take multiple viewings before they can be fully understood.

My greatest regret is that I don't own a bigger TV; this was a film that deserved the movie theater. It was mind-blowing on a huge screen.",1108857600,3,2100,4.639784946236559

1521188,2,B00005JNLQ,"Some people are tone deaf or color blind.  I'm deaf and blind where Bill Murray and Owen Wilson are concerned.  Wilson is a minimalist as an actor, which means that he doesn't seem like an actor at all;  Murray always seems to be standing at a distance from what he does, guying it.  It can work in certain kinds of sketches, but for me, it doesn't carry a movie.  And when he tries for more?  I mean how tiresome was ""Lost in Translation"" really?  And yet, Wes Anderson, whose ""Moonrise Kingdom"" I enjoyed, clearly loves him.  ""The Life Aquatic,"" though, is just dull.  It has a nice palette; it has music, if you like David Bowie songs in Portuguese; it has surprises -- how come we didn't notice the helicopter earlier?  But it doesn't add up to anything.  It's sterile and trivial, an exercise in a kind of aestheticism that requires a degree of detachment in the experience that I can't find myself willing to exercise.  It's not a mess -- Anderson knows what he's doing, and I have no quarrel with folks who are more attuned to this mode than I am.

1521635,4,B00005JNLQ,"I have to agree with other evaluations that this movie is not for all tastes. The humor, if there is humor, is of the esoteric variety. At times the plot is exceedingly cruel to some of the characters. Bill Murray's lead character, Steve Zissou, seemed very close to being a sociopath ... emotionally unfazed by anything that happened, and willing to risk everyone for his own superficial goals.

Yet, I found myself drawn along through scene after scene, even though I cannot say that any of them particularly delighted me. I wasn't bored, I wasn't truly entertained, and I doubt I will watch this a second time. Yet I'm not drawn to be miserly on the stars. A lot of thought went into this exceedingly odd creation, and I feel like I should reward that, if nothing else.

1521801,3,B00005JNLQ,the commentators sound track is awful. it sounds like they sat in a Starbucks and through the whole thing you hear conversations of patrons in the background. just really distracting.every few minutes there is also a beeping in the first 15 minutes of the dialogue. the DVD version without this really lousy commentary is so much better.,1446508800,,337,4.9298245614035086
1521802,4,B00005JNLQ,Funny movie. My husband watched it 4 times when we rented it...I however could only hang for one time. The quirkyness of the characters is great and Bill Murray is awesome.

I enjoyed the acting, particularly Bill Murray and Willem Defoe, and always enjoy the ""dreamsical"" look and vibe of Wes Anderson's films. That aside, the humor is of amusing variety and not at all hilarious. So while I enjoyed it, I would not recommend it to many people I know.",1444262400,,401,4.36

There is no plot; there is no story line; it appears to just be a stream of consciousness film based on parody, satire and wit. If you don't like this type of film you aren't going to enjoy this film. It made me laugh and by the end I was convinced the writers were on peyote when they wrote it. The colors are spectacular.",1441670400,,486,4.236559139784946

1521999,5,B00005JNLQ,"My favorite Wes Anderson movie. Thoughtful, exciting and clever.
It has a whimsical style that is amusing which contrasts the issues a man or woman face when they realize that perhaps life is passing them by. That their best years are behind them and many of their dreams didn't and likely aren't going to be fulfilled.
The music is exceptional. I never imagined Bowie on Portuguese would be a good fit in a movie, but it's perfect here.
The underwater scenes are unique. Colorful, beautiful, surreal!
The cast, like in all of Anderson's movies, is odd yet fits the oddity of  script perfectly.
It will be more enjoyable for the older crowd as it deals with themes more relatable to those in middle age.
After watching it, whether you like it or not, you will find it unique!",1440201600,2,775,4.615942028985507

Are the actors laughing at themselves, are they laughing at me, am I laughing at this film, or am I laughing at myself?---all of the above.  Farcical.  Is there really a Team Zissou?---of course not, yet it kinda makes you wish there were.  Now I want to watch it again.  There was definitely a father-son dynamic going on between the father and the son.  Bill Murray carries it, and Jeff Goldblum is ... sublime, and Jeff, you are welcome for me saying that.  I liked Owen Wilson and Anjelica Huston doing their schtick like fish taking to water they breathed believability into their characters, not!  Haha.

The movie doesn't fail for lack of budget - some of the special effects were great.  But, I don't know, nothing much that I cared about ever happened.

1522187,5,B00005JNLQ,"Bill Murray is my absolute favorite actor ever. I can't find a movie he's in that I don't at least like. Even when he voiced my favorite comic strip character, Garfield, I enjoyed hearing his familiar voice. So picking my favorite Bill Murray film is a very tough thing to do, so I just decided to take the highest ranking one on my list and do a review of it. Actually, it seems fitting I would do a review of The Life Aquatic. Wes Anderson also happens to be one of my favorite directors (no, not just because of his name) and his films are delightfully quirky. This one happens to be my favorite of his as well, so the combination of the two seems like the perfect recipe right?

Absolutely.

The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou follows the title character, a deep-sea diver, on a revenge quest to find and kill the shark that murdered his longtime diving partner and best friend, Esteban. He decides to make his revenge scheme his next big documentary, and takes his film crew with him. Along the way, a longtime fan named Ned Plimpton (played by Owen Wilson) who believes that Zissou is his father, decides to tag along with him, hoping to get to know and become closer friends with the famed oceanographer.

There are a lot of memorable characters in The Life Aquatic, as is usually the case with Wes Anderson films. Willem Dafoe has a lovely role as Klaus, the German sailor in the crew. Also included are stellar performances from the likes of Anjelica Huston, Cate Blanchett, Jeff Goldblum, and Bud Cort. There's also an awesome musician who sings Brazilian translations of David Bowie songs while playing a guitar, and a lot of awesome things happen throughout the film, not limited to being overtaken by a pirate crew.

Bill Murray is simply badass in this film. I literally can't think of any other way to describe how he is in this. I dare say that it's his best role, and I really don't know what I'm going to do with my life after he is long gone. I suppose the very foundation of cinema will crumble, wither away, and die, and we will be left with no real new films anymore. I'm being facetious of course, but you all know what I mean. Bill Murray is a delightful actor, and he has some of the most memorable roles I've seen. Steve Zissou is one of, if not his actual best role in his career thus far. An underrated masterpiece.",1429056000,,2343,4.441860465116279

If they wanted to spoof Cousteau, Ballard, the Taylors and others, they could at least have Googled ""satire"" as a contextual starting point.

1522443,3,B00005JNLQ,"For many out there I think the best way to describe this movie is to say it's like a more sophisticated version of Napoleon Dynamite. At its core The Life Aquatic is a quirky comedy that relishes in more mundane observations rather than the cheap pratfall or more opportunistic comical themes. So really this movie is made for an audience that appreciates this. While I appreciate the art house stylings and the interactions I ended up feeling the movie lacking enough to not really say I liked the movie, although I did enjoy it enough to follow through to the end.

This is a sort of parody of the oceanographic documentaries and is lovingly dedicated to the great Jacques Cousteau. It is about famed explorer Steve Zissou on possibly his final voyage to seek out the Giant Jaguar Shark that killed his former associate. The expedition is funded with the intent of making a documentary to show this creature to the world, but Zissou is intent on avenging his friend's death. At the same time Steve's long lost son arrives and joins the team. All of this sets the story up for various plot elements like the budding relationship between father and son, the challenges of supporting the expedition, competition, threats at sea and more.

The majority of the film evolves around various discussions between the leads. This is where much of the charm comes from the film, but it is also the limitation. After a short while the story kind of feels like it sits in place with no real forward momentum. Sure some events happen to liven things up, but all in all you're still stuck in a boat waiting for the end of the movie. At times the movie can get a bit dark, while at the same time continuing it's comedic styling, which didn't set well with me. It's not that I don't appreciate this kind of prose, or that it's not done well. It's just the experience I had watching the movie didn't feel so entertaining or fulfilling.

The acting is dry and witty. Bill Murray pulls off this aloof and complicated character well. However the character itself was inconsistent. On one instance he's arrogant, another self-depreciating, then another bold and fearless of danger, while another timid to the challenge ahead. And this is isn't done in a three-dimensional character building type way. Zissou is just all over the place for the sake of it. The acting style across the board is along the same lines, which works with the great cast. However dynamic emotions aren't in the script. Just and almost a narrative style of dialog that speaks of most events and happenings as a matter of fact with only the subtlest reaction for the most part.

Cinematography is quite impressive, and is the undoubtable gem of the film. Camera angles, cropping, perspective. Each scene has something to savor in how the camera frames the scene. You may get caught up in the background imagery as much as the subject on the camera. The Life Aquatic also uses computer animation in a way that makes a stand out artistic statement. I mainly caught many undersea creatures that may not really exist done in CGI with lots of vibrant color and movement. Mark Mothersbaugh (of Devo fame) created the minimalist and catchy soundtrack that in a way gives a similar music vibe to the film as Napoleon Dynamite while upping the ante quite a bit.

Criterion is known for making superb video presentations and this film is no different. The video has been remastered to 4K resolution from the original 35mm film. It was announced that thousands of instances of dirt, dust and other specks were manually removed. The end result is a very clear and beautiful transfer. It's not 100% free of dust artifacts, but if you have seen previous releases you will notice a significant, very significant, difference. Audio was also remastered at 24bits from the original tape reel and original 5.1 surround format. No other audio options other than subtitles. There are a decent host of extras includes as well. Here is the breakdown:

Commentary - Director Wes Anderson and co-writer Noah Baumbach did this commentary exclusively for this Criterion release.

Making of Featurette - Raw shooting footage interlaced with comments from the actors and crew.

Intern Video Journal - Matt Gray (who played one of the interns on the film) did some of his own behind the scenes footage when they are shooting the film in Italy. It includes cast and crew comments and some footage of Wes Anderson directing.

Cast and Crew Interviews - Just like is sounds. Seven short interviews with most of them having multiple participants. They cover things like characters, costumes, visual effects, direction and more.

This is an Adventure -  A making of documentary by Albert Maysles, Antonio Ferrera, and Matthew Prinzing. This is the longest featurette running almost an hour.

Deleted Scenes - Nine deleted scenes shown in high definition.

Mondo Monda - An Italian program interviewed Wes and Noah while they were shooting in Italy, and this is the portion of the program with that interview. Runs about 17 minutes.

Seu Jorge Performs David Bowie - That guy in the movie that keeps singing David Bowie covers in the movie has his own featurette. If you enjoyed hearing his acoustic version of these songs (in Portuguese I believe) in the film this is a great way to get to them directly.

Designs - A collection of design sketches and photos.

Photos - Set photographer Philippe Antonello chronicled the production in its entirety. You can see the photos here.

Leaflet - Shows a cutaway view of the ship along with Eric Anderson's own design sketches along with a conversation between Wes and Eric.

Original Theatrical Trailer

The Like Aquatic With Steve Zissou is not a film for everybody. It has its moment of action and heart, but it's a more reflective and observational type of humor than what you may be expecting from Bill Murray's previous works. As an art house comedy it stands out, and deserves the awards and accolades. However I wasn't completely sold. I didn't regret seeing the movie, and am glad I did. I'm just not ready to fully endorse it or tell my friends to go watch it.",1420416000,,6130,4.776937618147448

1522449,3,B00005JNLQ,"My least favorite of Wes Anderson's films (i know I'm in the minority camp on this one). Visually, it's wonderful, the soundtrack is dynamite, and great performances are delivered by Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum and Willem Dafoe, but Anderson's trademark affected detached emotionalism, usually charming and poignant, is egregiously rote and blocky here, and the serious dialogue feels especially perfunctory. It feels like Anderson had a great visual idea and concept for this movie, but for once was at a loss on how to integrate his characters into his vision. His style completely trumps substance here, a rare misstep (if you're an Anderson fan). I still give it three stars because of its humor and love of Jacques Cousteau. Most of Anderson's movies bear up under repeat viewing and reveal new facets: The Life Aquatic is the one exception.",1419984000,,845,5.086330935251799

1522583,5,B00005JNLQ,"I'm not qualified to have an objective opinion about this film!

I grew up on 16mm science films in grade school, loved the Jacques Cousteau TV documentaries, and later worked on sports-related 16mm documentaries myself. So...cheezy, low budget 16mm docs are in my blood. Frankly, this film nails them perfectly. And it nails the kind of people who are driven to make them as well. Every character in this film resonates with me.

Anderson has a knack for getting characters much older than himself right. (Royal in Tennebaums, the mom in Darjeeling, Steve Zissou here, etc.) I can say that with some confidence because I'm close to the age of these characters. In this film, Steve Zissou has a Don Quixote quality. The sheer force of his illusions carries him forward...while his family and co-workers recoil in horror.

I give it 5 stars, but I can't give this film a blanket recommendation. Anyone who is either too young to understand the 16mm film genre might not relate to the humor or story telling here. It's worth checking out the trailers on youtube to take your own temperature.",1418601600,12,1089,4.81283422459893

1523143,5,B00005JNLQ,"Dear Captain Anderson.
I am 34 years old
and live in Kneebone, Arizona.
It is an old Indian town. The name is pronounced Ka-nee-bonay.
A creek runs behind our house
where I live with my mother.
It is not awkward
as you might expect it to be.
I still get dates, is what I'm saying.

One of my dates met you once some years ago
She wondered if you like women.
Do you?
Like women, that is.
Either way. It doesn't matter to me.
She just was feeling insecure so I told her
I would ask you.
and I collect and catalog books,
movies and homeless dogs.

I don't know what this one is called,
so I named it myself.

[picture: Wes the Dog]

You are probably my one of,
if not the, favorite director I've ever studied.
I plan to be either,
""A,"" a stenographer
""B,"" an autodidact, ""C,"" a pluot.

Thank you very much for your good work.

Sincerely, Nick Tambleton,
Blue Oyster Cadet, Anderson Society.

P.S. Do you ever wish
you could breathe underwater?

****

Dear Nick Tambleton,
First, in answer
to your question, always.
Second, thank you very much
for naming your dog after me.
My wife tells me
it is actually a type of terrier.
By including a reference to my wife in this letter
I hope I have answered your other lingering
question.

You strike me as a very special boy
and a key member of the Anderson Society.
I wish I could come visit you in Arizona
and assist you with your work, whatever that is.
I am not sure you mentioned it.

Take care of yourself, Nick Tambleton.

You've served well.

p.s. ""The Life Aquatic"" is as about ridiculous and incoherent as this review; that being said, it is my hands down FAVORITE Wes Anderson movie. Probably the ocean exploration theme has a lot to do with it. Also, the scene where Jeff Goldblum's marvelously pompous character, Alistair Hennessey, gets shot point blank in the chest and is still quite able to run the requisite miles to escape Pescespada Island is solid gold.",1406764800,,1912,4.413105413105413

1523242,5,B00005JNLQ,"This movie is polarizing. The reviews for it illustrate as much.

When I first saw it, in the theater, I was nonplussed to moderately amused and I hated the ending that I, then, found to be, what's the word? Mushy? That was part of it, but that word doesn't encapsulate my entire feeling about that shark at the time. I think that I felt that the shark was a bit like a giant Disney animatronic animal that shouldn't have been used for the denouement of any film worth seeing (take that, shark!). However my prior feeling is articulated, I can state that the ending didn't sit well with me. For years, I maintained that opinion and, unsurprisingly, didn't watch it again during that period. Then I started watching through all of Wes Anderson's films again and, when I ran out of films to watch, I again watched The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou.

After the second and third time I watched it, it grew on me. I grew to like the, yes, 'mushy' ending in light of the emotional fragility, insecurity, and chronic tragedy that the characters were subject to throughout the film. A cheap trick? Maybe. I might care more if the film wasn't so painfully original and well acted.

It only gelled for me on repeated viewings. I believe that this is because there is a lot going on, and its difficult to keep up in a way that properly organizes the totality of the story in terms of character nuance, and even the general story line, until it is viewed repeatedly. Can one call such a fantastical dark comedy complex? If you can, then it assuredly applies to this film; although, at first blush the complexity might not be perceived. All you may remember is Bill Murray being both sad and angry, Seu Jorge doing Bob Marley covers,  and a giant leopard shark swimming to Sigur Ros. My point is, on first viewing, the movie can seem like a bit of a blur punctuated by a CGI shark and I can see how it could be written off. However, If you enjoy creative films, my advice is to give it a second and even a third chance that will allow for a closer look.

The above might seem like an over-analysis, but it's the best explanation that I can come up with that elucidates how this movie can go from mediocre at best, in my eyes, to, in my opinion, perhaps Wes Anderson's best. It is his best at least from the perspective of a movie that is, in my opinion, both his most creative as well as one that is successful in what it attempts to do.

Other movies of his are successful in telling a fascinating, well written story (ie: The Royal Tenenbaums), and are exceedingly creative but ultimately less so than The Life Aquatic. Still other movies of his, like Moonrise Kingdom and The Grand Budapest Hotel, are superficially creative in their set designs and other Anderson-esque style markers, but in my opinion, fall flat in terms of their story and dialogue creativity (especially if re-used stylistic signature is taken into account).

I enjoy this movie immensely, and there isn't another film that is remotely like it. I go back and forth as to whether this or The Darjeeling Limited, a simpler film that I find to be Anderson's most pleasurable movie to (re)watch, is his overall 'best'. You can check in with my review on that latter-mentioned film's amazon page for a more thorough exposition on those thoughts (and more The Life Aquatic Angst).",1405728000,4,3336,4.5407653910149754

1523456,4,B00005JNLQ,"This movie is great if you have a warped sence of humor and a love for the ocean. That's all that's required to start living the life aquatic. One of my favorite characters is not even alive. It's a ship called the Belafonte that was purchased to serve as the setting and mode of transport for our beloved crew. A huge cutaway model of the ship was constructed so filming the actors onboard is seamless.

I can't give it 5 stars for a couple of reasons. The reporter known as cubby is unlikeable. She is pregnant and the babies father is not involved in her life. There are two scenes where she tries to call him but he doesn't answer. We never hear from him and this sub plot is a dead end. She is thrown onboard as a love interest to create tension between the two main characters who are father and son. I just never warmed up to her character. The audio commentary is difficult to follow because it's taped in an active noisey restaurant. Patrons talking, utensils dropping, glasses clinking,  it's too distracting to enjoy.",1402444800,,1028,4.462765957446808

The image has always been overly soft and the resolution a bit fuzzy and weird. Well I can report that the Blu-Ray resolves all the issues and that the film now looks superb! The colours are amazing, deliberately surreal at times and it wasn't as obvious before.

1523460,4,B00005JNLQ,"I don't know what you call this film. Like a lot of Bill Murray's work,here, he's again on the edge between brilliance and groaning lameness. But that's also exactly what this film needed to avoid being an inane waste of time. And, like a lot of Bill Murray vehicles, much (maybe most) of the scenes are foolish, but taken as a whole, it's a wonderful foolishness. I think one of the important things to say about it is that it is entirely consistent and weirdly believable. In many films, you frequently wonder why didn't the character just do such and such - it seems so obvious. In Life Aquatic, they're strange folks, and they could hardly behave any other way, and there's just no way you could imagining them avoiding their troubles be behaving rationally. In other words, a classic Murray character dragging a case of other hapless characters through their own little world.. You could say it's predictable, but it doesn't matter, because you just don't expect these characters to really behave in predictable ways. Unpredictably, they do, and in a satisfying way.

It's not going to make the lists of top films. It's a box office nightmare. And a bunch of you are going to feel like asking for your money and time back.

The colors are penetrating and the crispness of detail appears in just about every frame of this eccentric movie. The extras are plentiful and navigation to them is easily accessible from the side-sliding menus. GIMME SHELTER/a documentary of the Rolling Stones' 1969 tour was the first Criterion Collection Blu-ray I'd bought and with this second Criterion purchase my appreciation for what they do for film restoration has only deepened.

Me? I really like this movie. It is fun, serious and the right kind of quirky. I'm not someone who cares for a lot of these so-called ""art house films."" I usually can't stand those. This one is quirky w/out going to the obscure level of some of those films that are actually terrible, but have been sold as good.

I think this movie strikes the right balance between uniqueness, quirkiness, drama and fun. In my opinion, it is also the best effort to date from this director (although the camping one with Ed Norton, is a close second).

1523547,5,B00005JNLQ,"I have to say, this is probably one of my top ten favorite movies. Wes Anderson has some great films, this not the least.
Bill Murray is brilliant (as usual) as the title character. A great cast that does an equally fantastic job. Angelica Houston, Michael Gambon, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Owen Wilson (as Kingsley 'Ned' Zissou),Cate Blanchett and Seymour Cassel as Esteban.
  (Esteban was eaten! Esteban was BITTEN? No, eaten. Swallowed whole? No, chewed!)
Although he has only a few lines, Bud Cort as the 'Bond Company stooge' is hilarious. I've also grown to love the strange soundtrack heard in this film. It's almost an Anderson trademark.

I am taken back to the days of the old Jacques Cousteau shows of the 60's and 70's; I'd love to get my hands on the publicity posters of the 'Zissou Films' shown in the film. Plus a kind of a nod at the end to The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai; Across the Eighth Dimension.

This Blu-Ray is fantastic! The colors are as sharp, bright and clear as you get, a superior job with this one. Criterion really knows how to give these releases the full treatment.",1401235200,5,1106,4.656410256410257

1523677,5,B00005JNLQ,"The Life Aquatic is a great movie that focusing on a primary plot moving element which is ultimately to take revenge on an unknown sea shark doubly named the ""Jaguar Shark"", which ate the friend of protagonist Steve Zissou.  The movie has many whimsical almost magical notes that allow the viewer to live in the world director, Wes Anderson, has created to suite his requirements of finding the shark and having several character sub plots for several characters we slowly start to know, understand, and finally connect with.  Steve Zissou is the man we find ourselves rooting for especially.  He is a man that has followed his passion his whole life and appears to be very well traveled, intelligent, and obsessed with creating the environment to document his every adventure with a full camera and sea faring crew including 6 unnamed interns.  Positioning the movie as a documentary to find and kill this Jaguar Shark, Anderson allows the movie to be slightly poetic and having a need to make for a good movie.  One of Zissou's crew members is a full time Soundboard expert for the documentary that plays David Bowie songs with his acoustic guitar, adding to the whimsical feel.  The movie also strives to give the audience a good feeling.  That Zissou, despite going through depression and older age, seems to be a constant driving force for the crew, but in his own way which includes a focus on very detailed oriented and well thought out plans essential to make his mission a complete success.  For instance, a short break in the movie occurs for Zissou to explain his sea-faring ship to the new member of his crew, his son, which is slowly verified throughout the course of the film.  As Zissou takes us through his ship he explains, that when he purchased the boat, and for how much; and a small fact about each room.  The kitchen, he explains has the most technological instruments on the ship.  By saying that piece of seemingly insignificant information actually tells the viewer that he takes high importance in the simple pleasures in life of having high quality food.  However, you never see the crew eat, or is this fact ever mentioned again.  This gives that reader a sliver of information that this crew eats well, and divulges what Zissou's priorities are or that he works hard to provide a meaningful and generally happy life.
The movie also has many sub plot moving points and many insignificant plot points that are just fun to watch but upon further glance it's these scenes that give insight that could have only been narrated.  One instance, is when Zissou accepts a gift of the multicolored miniature sea horse that was given to Zissou by the first mate's son.  Through a course of events the bag, which held this marvelous creature, was punctured.  The quick thinking Zissou grabs a champagne glass with seamless hesitation and fills the sea horse and it's water into the champagne glass and rising it above his head as he makes his exit through the busy room.  The other insignificant scene/character includes the two albino dolphins which have been outfitted with video cameras to swim aside the ship giving some reconnaissance to the control room within the ship's hull.  Zissou constantly doubts the effectiveness of these two dolphins claiming them to be worthless.  Later in the film, however, these dolphins play in a minor part for a laugh in the movie giving the viewer the chance to see the dolphin find something, and Zissou not quite catching it.  One more instance of the insignificant plot points are the glowing jellyfish that drifted onto the beach when the tide pulled back.  Hundreds of glowing jellyfish illuminate the beach.  Ned, Zissou's so-called son, holds that microphone boom for Zissou's documentary.  The scene is used to allow Zissou to allow Ned to enter a scene in his documentary when Ned asked `why do the jellyfish glow'.  The viewer gets more insight into Zissou's want to get to know his son.  It becomes more relevant when we find out that Zissou knew he had a son since he was born, and never made an effort to find him earlier in his life.  Which begs the question, why is Zissou trying to rekindle the relationship, and why is Ned continuing to accept the fact while he continues to be a member of the Zissou crew.  The answer seems to be ideals and a sense of adventure for the complete unknown with well-developed story themes with a different almost child-like view on life while they prepare and hunt for the Jaguar Shark.",1397347200,,4492,4.76258064516129

1523685,5,B00005JNLQ,"To begin with, I must confess that when I 1st saw THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU, I had not yet seen Wes Anderson's most well known film, THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS, or his feature debut, BOTTLE ROCKET. I make this preface because many negative comments of LIFE AQUATIC I have read have been made by Anderson fans who have seen all of his works. I have not and other than RUSHMORE have nothing to compare LIFE AQUATIC to.

With that said, I found THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU to be a thoroughly enjoyable, entertaining, and emotional film. The movie revolves around Steve Zissou (played to perfection by Bill Murray), a modern-day nature documentary filmmaker and oceanographer not all that unlike the late Jacques Costeau. Zissou is planning what will probably be his final voyage. His company & crew have run out of money and his latest film was the latest in a series of cinematic flops. However, Zissou's life-long friend and co-worker, Esteban du Plantier, was killed by a mysterious shark below water. Zissou promises that his next film will bring closure to Esteban's death and he plans on killing the shark that ate his friend.

As plans for the adventure begin, Zissou meets Ned Plimpton, a young man who believes Zissou might be his biological father. The meeting stirs Zissou's emotions and he decides to take Ned under his wing and with him on his later adventure. The theft of an expresso machine, a kidnapping by pirates, and the hunt for a giant shark ensue.

Murray is perfectly cast as the title character. Anderson specifically wrote the role for Bill Murray and said that Zissou ""could have been no one else"". The quote is correct because no other actor could have captured the slight nuances of the character as well as Murray. Cate Blanchett, Anjelica Huston, and Owen Wilson pull off some decent supporting performances, but other than Murray, Willem Dafoe and Jeff Goldblum are the actors to watch. Dafoe, who is best known for his creepy bad-guy roles, is hilarious as Klaus Daimler, the German camera-man aboard Zissou's crew. As for Goldblum, he's worth watching any time he's in a movie, but it's particular enjoyable to see him as a semi-bad-guy as Zissou's arch rival, Alistair Hennessey.

LIFE AQUATIC contains all kinds of cool visual images, from rainbow fish to box stage sets. However, one of the best things about the movie isn't the visual images but the soundtrack. The film's soundtrack is largely composed of David Bowie songs sung by a variety of people, but most notably Seu Jorge. Accompanying these new interpretations are a variety of memorable instrumental pieces (most notably ""Ping Island/Lighting Strike Rescue Op"") composed by Mark Mothersbaugh.

THE LIFE AQUATIC is a movie that is filled with surprises. There were several times that the movie took a turn I didn't expect it to. None of these turnings were all that far-fetched and the situations and reactions seemed real and kept me engaged in the characters on screen. Though the THE LIFE AQUATIC is a movie all dressed up, it also has a lot of substance. At it's core the film is a redemption story. It's all about a man and how is life is redeemed not solely through any actions of his own, but through the actions of others. One could even say that the film is an allegory of faith and a spiritual epiphany and unlike Ahab and Moby Dick, things don't turn out too bad in the end.",1396569600,3,3390,4.758503401360544

But, to the review.  Life Aquatic is a nice little film that plays on he riffs of several genres, and pretends to take jabs at both Jaque Cousteau and the 70s and 80s film history in general.  It's a kind of ""Buckaroo Banzai"" for the allegedly too cool to fool audience, most of whom are between the ages of high school and 30 somethings (perhaps slightly older), and remember the era with a kind of aloof fondness and condescension all at once.

That's who this film is for, and why it's kind of disjointed and so off the wall.  It's a kind of fantasy for pop culture film buff elitists who like to smirk and grin at alleged ""in jokes"".

Having said all that, it is kind of a fun film that's zany and clever.  If you've seen Wes Anderson's other films, then you kind of know what to expect, only this film is a little further out there than normal, and yet entertaining in a teenage boy kind of way.

1523994,5,B00005JNLQ,"Wes is by far one of the best directors in our modern day world. Most of his films fascinate me beyond my imagination, and even to the point of pondering, ""How did this man do it."" I think I'm a person who will never understand what it's like to hate a Wes Anderson film. I absolutely adore his films by way of narrative style, cinematography, colors, and vivd characters and environments. One particular thing about his films that I think no one else can capture is the human emotion that occurs within in these quirky environments. Whenever viewing his films, I always capture a sense of emotion that connects to my life, and for many others as well. By Wes creating his films through his vision, he continues to inspire me to become a filmmaker myself.

The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is by far one of the most underrated comedy masterpieces of our time. The film is a tribute to the great oceanographer Jacque Yves Cousteau. Anderson usually incorporates underwater scenes within most of his films, (Bottle Rocket, Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, Fantastic Mr. Fox, Moonrise Kingdom) so it was quite necessary for his interest to be placed within this story. I really do not wish to reveal much about this film, but... Wow! Never have I seen a movie so damn funny, so damn creative, and so well acted. Everything with this film hit high points for me, and to be honest, critics... What were you thinking? Just because a film is dead pan mixed in with surreal environments doesn't make it boring, it creates a world of it's own.

Theory: Maybe people should actually think about what their watching, instead of always expecting predictable plots
(Sorry, this is my opinion, not everyone's entitled to it.)

The story is greatly planned out, the script is absolute genius, and Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, and Willem Dafoe SHINE.

Moreover, the depth of understanding of the expressive potential of cinematic dialog evidenced by Anderson's scripts reveal that we have have only just begun to explore this art form.

1524370,4,B00005JNLQ,"The other reviews do a good job of laying out the story and at least one alluded to Moby Dick. This is what spoke to me: a man in decline on an impossible quest and realizing that his life devoted to fakery has become fake and finding acceptance in this. Even his family is fake but he MAKES them real, accepts a potential interloper as a son, and feels the loss at the end. In short the fake becomes real and the real becomes somewhat fake. Bill Murray annoys me as much or more than most of the reviewers here, but I think he was perfect for this role because he has the sense that emotions are all fake and then the sense of loss and emptiness that comes about as a result of that. Seeing the hokey looking ""Jaguar Shark"" was simultaneously hilarious and sad as the figures sat behind the submarine windows wondering which side of the window was fiction, them or the silly beast. And the joke seems to be on us viewers, with this sort of question. Of course I may be reading too much into this little gem. There are some great campy send ups of other movies, of the egoism of the Jacques Cousteau types and adventurers, of the father issues most sensitive men have in the western world, of shootout scenes where nobody important ever seems hurt in the hail of bullets. These scenes are humorous, but the Bill Murray character lends them a sadness because he actually seems to be the embodiment of that dilemma of humans having become more produced than producers.",1358640000,,1466,4.413284132841328

1524442,4,B00005JNLQ,"The Life Aquatic is visually captivating; it has a style all it's own. The story attempts to define a mid-life crisis of sorts as told through the eyes of a Jacques Cousteau clone. The fun performances all define quirk in an offbeat comedy. As a film on it's own, I would rate it as a solid, interesting and yet fairly light film. When I fit it into Wes Anderson's other films it becomes more of a diamond in the rough. The subtle, simple dialogue and clearly drawn characters all add some impressive depth to Anderson's repertoire. The striking visual style and simplicity of the script are all pretty amazing when added to his scope of work. As a vaque spoiler, I don't understand why one of the main characters was killed off towards the end. It didn't seem to drive the story anywhere it wasn't heading ahead of time.

Murray is great as the lead but at times the script seems to be too wild and packed with too many things to resemble any kind of cohesive art that you would be looking for after viewing his other films.

Maybe that is the point. Some of the film can even get a bit boring and I don't usually say that with Wes Anderson films. Try it out. I'm leaning towards 3.5 stars but overall it is not bad at all just a bit average IMO for this director who has a superb body of work.

1524564,5,B00005JNLQ,"When I saw this in the theater I got the same kind of feeling I got during Pulp Fiction and Anchorman at first viewing. So stylized and surreal and leaving me questioning why they don't make all movies like this.

The comedy of The Life Aquatic is, at times, so veiled or subtle that it is difficult to even realize there is a joke. Often there is no punch line; you just kind of have to feel it.

The music of Bowie/Seu Jorge was crazy good. The out-of-the-blue action scene was a masterpiece of direction. The CGI was what other CGI wishes it could be.

As quirky as the story was, and as odd-ball as the characters were, it all felt human to me. The Life Aquatic covers the spectrum of emotion: pride, fear, grief, happiness, anger, and love through a Technicolor kaleidoscope.",1349913600,2,780,4.440559440559441
1524565,1,B00005JNLQ,"It is said that comedy is the hardest genre to act in.  I would agree.  One not only needs a good script, but also a certain stage presence, delivery, and connection with the audience.  And sometimes, the audience might not understand that a scene that is funny is not supposed to be, and vice versa.  This is how I felt towards this movie.  Starring a cast full of lifetime comedians such as Bill Murray and Owen Wilson, and lifetime drama actors and actresses such as Willem Defoe, Angelica Huston and Michael Gambon, I watched this movie and came away puzzled.  Was it suppose to be funny?  Was it supposed to be sad?  I am not sure.  The plot is original enough, and the acting seemed authentic.  But the story seemed quite ridiculous, and there were times I was waiting for Bill Murray to crack a joke.  Unfortunately, none came and the movie passed by blandly.  Overall, a waste of time comparable to other movies by Wes Anderson such as The Royal Tenenbaums and Rushmore.",1349049600,9,978,4.557471264367816
1524566,4,B00005JNLQ,"Despite buying this twice and both times recieving just one of the two dscs in packaging that is... Unusually slapdash for criterion... Obviously at least the packaging is not official.
In addition, the black sections of the image are blotchy and ugly on 4 different screens I tested.

I strongly suspect this to be a counterfeit product, or at minimum some sort of grey market batch, as I and a different reviewer here had the same issue with years in between.

Nonetheless the film is so great and leaves such joy in the viewer I had to give it high marks!
I think despite the relatively poor critical reception this is one of his best films.  By dispensing with any pretense to superficial realism, he somehow recaptures a sense of pure honest authenicity equal to it's mirror film Rushmore.  I think it's better than Bottle Rocket
For children of the 60s 70s and 80's there is much creative nostalgia to enjoy, an lement that could easily have been cliche or corny but to the contrary, the nostalgic Cousteau references, the 60s /  70s look and feel, the colors, the music, the fashions, more than a hint of Buckaroo Bansai are all powerful emotionally trigerring comforting touches which paradoxically feel completely fresh, original, and integral to the plot.

Visually it is a delicious dessert.  Cinematically it manages to acheive many of his longtime goals as a filmmaker by a different route, and one that feels both more enertainingly fantastic and more emotionally grounded and real than hus other more celebrated works.
Plus, who doesnt love Henry Selick's stop motion animation, now back in fashion again?

Although it is bittersweet and has tragic elements, the film also has the ability to fill the viewer with light and warmth enough to transform a bad day into a good one.  I speak from experience.

The humor is somewhat typical Wes Anderson style, which is good. It's quirky and dry. Definitely not for everyone. Most people I know wouldn't pick up on a single funny moment in the whole movie, but that doesn't mean it's bad. A classic line in the movie for me would be when Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) has just met his twenty something year old son, Ned, for the first time. Zissou is standing there with his son and someone he knows stops to talk to him. He introduces his son to the man by saying, ""This is probably my son Ned."" For some reason I just thought that was hilarious. Bill Murray can do no wrong by me. I haven't seen Moonrise Kingdom, but so far this movie ranks as my 3rd favorite Wes Anderson film. Tenenbaums being my 2nd, and Rushmore being my 1st. If you enjoyed both of those movies, chances are you'll probably like this one, even though it's not as good as the others.",1346544000,3,1036,4.373056994818653

It's silly, boring, and devoid of feeling, meaning, and emotion.  Then, I watch it again and it becomes more interesting.  The third time, I find myself charmed and amused.  The characters say things that are very emotional, but they don't behave emotionally.  The story finds interesting places to go, but for no reason.  The film has no guiding theme, and yet, everything fits together.  His films are a lot like life.  It makes no sense except by living it.  The Life Aquatic is my favorite film, with The Royal T's a close second.  A sweet picture, but Rushmore is an apple among these oranges.  Don't get me wrong, he doesn't always hit his mark.  That Jeerdarling film, or whatever it's called, is better than Ethan Frome for curing insomnia.  I've tried, but the more I watch it, the badder it is.

1524639,2,B00005JNLQ,"A girl who knows she is very beautiful and attractive rejects every guy that comes onto her, she just likes the attention and that's it; that's how I'd describe this movie. It's visually appealing, has a great cast of characters, and an interesting story about a burn out Jacques Cousteau character Steve Zissou who's mission is to hunt down a leopard shark (the movie makes up it's own creatures) that killed his best friend. However Wes Anderson purposely sabatoges any hook to engage the audience and kind of just assumes we'll like it. Lame move Wes, lame.

It sounds like the coolest movie ever, but it doesn't really do anything that interesting with it's characters. Bill Murray is played well, he's the weary leader of the Zissou ship and there are some good scenes showing his character's vulnerable side. Owen Wilson is his maybe-son who's naively interested in Steve Zissou's sad career and tags along for the ride to bond more with his long lost maybe-father. Cate Blanchett's an alright actress but I don't see her purpose in this movie, she kind of just hangs around nagging Steve and screwing Owen Wilson. Willem Defoe is pretty funny in this as he assumes he's Steve's surrogate son and gets jealous of Owen Wilson being in the spotlight; I wish Wes Anderson took more time to develop this character instead of Cate Blanchett most of the time. Jeff Goldblum is interesting as Zissou's rival, a high class A-hole who has quite an adventure of his own later on in the movie. Angelica Whoston? She was so pointless and nonexistent in this movie it seems that Wes Anderson has a hard time writing women. Other characters are pretty shallow and vapidly written as just 'quirky' stereotypes, such as a woman who randomly shows her breasts for no reason, an account that defies Zissou's preconcieved notions about the accountant type, or the black guy with a guitar who will only sing David Bowie songs for that hipster cred (we get it Wes, you're a Bowie fan), they all seemed so pointless which tie into the whole pointlessness of the movie.

I really thought I would like this movie, but instead it was kinda dull with some interesting parts. It has a good story, good characters, etc, everything going for it and yet it's like the movie calls you stupid for wanting to get involved. We don't really see much of Bill Murray as a captain or see much of his dreams or goals, instead we see his his father/son dynamic with Owen Wilson which could've made a good subplot but instead it's the main focus of the story and Zissou's mission to hunt down the shark is the subplot that you almost forget about until the very end. The visuals never really go anywhere either, the side shots of the ship were awesome to see, but that's about it. Zissou at one point in the movie sees a colorful gecko crawl onto his hand which he promptly flicks off, that seems to be Wes Anderson's apathetic approach to this movie's visuals as well, pointless filler the movie wants to get over with in order to get to the important/exciting stuff: who Cate Blanchett is sleeping with.

The Life Aquatic is sort of a dramedy, but it never really gets dramatic and it never really gets funny, it's just stagnant. Like when Zissou orders his team to raid Jeff Goldblum's facility there was some golden oppurtunity for some funny dialogue and banter, but it pretty much just plays off with Steve saying ""Let's take this stuff"", to which sometimes naked chick replies ""are you crazy Steve??"". Eh. The whole thing just kind of exists, not caring about drawing your attention or going somewhere meaningful. All of the characters are basically underdeveloped except for the love triangle between Steve, Owen Wilson, and Cate F-ing Blanchett. Plus all the characters just look bored most of the time (even when they're attacked by pirates); maybe it suits how down in the dumps Steve Zissou's career has gone but I get the feeling it was Anderson trying to be 'quirky' with his movie.",1336953600,4,3961,4.704610951008646

It would also help if Bill Murray had not lost his fastball years ago along with his curve, slider, changeup, split-finger and knuckleball among his comedy repertoire. The guy cannot make a funny movie anymore. It's just not possible.

The ""look"" of the flick is pretty decent. The quirkiness just falls so flat especially the guy who constantly pops up strumming on his acoustic guitar singing Bowie tunes (the extra DVD features all 10 songs done in Portuguese by Seu Jorge). Sorry, what was the point of that? Did not get whatever ironic symbolism it was supposed to convey.

This double DVD set comes with a printed booklet with a Q&A with director Wes Anderson and his brother Eric that has a cutout of the movie's funky ship. The extra DVD has a documentary on the making of the movie, Wes Anderson & Co-writer Noah Baumbach interviewed on Italian (OK, enough with the quirkiness, guys!) TV, an interview with ex-Devo (Are We Not Men? We Are Quirky) member Mark Mothersbaugh who did the soundtrack, an intern video done by a real-life intern (whoop de freakin' do!), bunch of interviews with cast and crew, behind-the-scenes feature (for, I suppose, what the docu didn't catch), deleted scenes, trailers, pics and artwork.

Basically, can you say ""filler""? I knew you could.

The English title of course is ""The Life Aquatic, With Steve Zissou"". The movie shook my tree then and has remained one of my favorites since. It is a quirky take on a wannabe Jacque Cousteau-type oceanographer, played by Bill Murray, whose friend is eaten by a never-before-seen 'Jaguar Shark'. With his crew, Zissou then goes off in search of this magnificent creature. A Brazilian troubadour sings David Bowie songs in Portuguese throughout the film, and the underwater life is created with CGI animation that doesn't even attempt to look real. The movie drifts along, as if sailing for the sake of sailing, with no particular destination in mind. And I love it.
Like other Wes Anderson films, The Life Aquatic isn't just a comedy. Sure it is filled with hilarious easter eggs that warrant repeated views and closer inspection, but it is also frequently touching, artfully shot, and wonderfully acted. I reckon Wes Anderson movies aren't for everyone, but I get the sense watching The Life Aquatic (and Royal Tenenbaums and Darjeeling Limited, etc) that Wes Anderson movies aren't meant to be for everybody. He makes these movies because he likes the stories, and he knows how to tell them in a unique and quirky way.

1524937,4,B00005JNLQ,"Continuing my discussion of Wes Anderson's work, I've come to `The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou'.  This film may be his most controversial to date, and I mean that because pretty much everyone I talk to either considers this his finest or his worst film.  I think that, conceptually, this is his best work.  That said, I have some issues with the films construction and overall presence and, while I don't think it's as bad as `Rushmore', I do consider it a lesser work, especially when compared to `The Royal Tenenbaums' or `Fantastic Mr. Fox'.

The film covers the adventures Steve Zissou, a marine filmmaker, as he ventures out to capture (and kill) the shark that ate his best friend.  Zissou's mission is thrown into disarray by the sudden emergence of Ned Plimpton (or Kingsley Zissou) who may or may not be Steve's son.  Add to that the appearance of a pregnant journalist named Jane, the jealousness of Steve's right hand man Klaus, the defiant stance of Steve's wife Eleanor and the arrogance of Steve's nemesis Alistair (not to mention a pirate attack) and you have the makings for a very awkward yet comically fulfilling adventure.

Sort of.

Anderson has a richly unique brand of humor that, at times, is a stroke of genius.  There is something about the way he layers his deadpan approach that can be awfully rewarding.  Here, sadly, he doesn't always nail his attempts.  While, for me, the film is rich with meaning and sentiment (I'll get to that in a minute), the film is not nearly as funny as it should have been.  Moments really land well (the chaotic pirate attack) but other parts (the entire first half almost) just seem to lay there stagnant, baiting you to find something humorous here.

It just doesn't work.

Like I mentioned, the concept is wonderful.  The idea that youth never dies in the heart of a boy is beautifully woven here.  You can see all the wonderful things that make being a child so enjoyable, and the fact that this is referenced a lot here (""that was my favorite age"") makes this statement so boisterous.  In the end, this is very much a `Peter Pan' type story, a story about a man who doesn't want to grow up.

The acting is pretty good here.  Sadly, the script doesn't allow for a lot of character development.  The only character that gets some good `fleshing' here is Steve, and to a degree Jane.  Maybe that is why Bill Murray and Cate Blanchett are the best in show here.  The rest of the cast does a fine job, but they really don't standout much (aside from a remarkably funny Jeff Goldblum) due to shallow character development.

Visually, the film is enticing.  The use of stop-motion and vibrant animation here was inspired and helped pave the way for Anderson to present us with his masterpiece, `Fantastic Mr. Fox'.  Like I said, in parts this film is very good, and I don't hate it at all.  I just know that it could have been better.  It could have been a lot better.

I'd give it a B-.",1271635200,,2946,4.56
1524938,5,B00005JNLQ,"Some Indie types denigrate this film as Wes Anderson's most pretentious outing. They complain about its length, hodge-podge nature, and lack of general cohesion.

The other characters are hilarious too and interact extremely well with one another. Willem Dafoe's Claus is a prime example. Deranged, yes. Odd, mhm. Endearing, You betcha.
  Anderson's BEAUTIFUL color palate is on display here in magnificent detail. This is his most ""epic"" film and the colors pop and fizzle, whether it is the Arctic Night-lights, the pretty claymation fish, the island locals, etc. Simply breathtaking. Several elaborate set pieces emerge that must be seen to be believed (Pirate Attack= One of the best scenes in movie history. I'm not kidding) Also the tone is very blithe and high-spirited throughout,  brimming with David Bowie hits (some in Portuguese) prompting the question, What's not love?

I can't think of anything bad to say about this film. The acting is impeccable. There is not a single scene that is not well directed. When I went to see this in the theatre I was totally taken by surprise. Like everyone else, I was expecting to see a Bill Murray movie and I suppose that is where some of the poor ratings stem from. But it didn't take me long to realize I was watching something different. Something fresh. Something with some genius involved. More artsy than fartsy. And I loved it. Every red capped, speedo infested minute of it.

By the way, the Amazon reviewer complains about the lack of character development with Owen Wilson's character. I'm not sure what the reviewer expected. I suppose he is an Owen Wilson fan, which is fine. But in this movie he was a side character. I mean it's right there in the title of the movie. The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou! It's not The Life Aquatic with Ned.

All that said, I never recommend this movie to anyone. It's a movie you either like or you don't.

Wes's style reminds me of her father's in that he creates seductive environments in order to tell a story - like John Huston did in Moulin Rouge, The Dead, The Maltese Falcon, etc. But Wes seems to let the scenes and dialogue evolve out of that, just letting them be what they are, so that instead of the usual contrived space-filling dialogue, the characters talk and act like I can believe they might actually do given their circumstances. While the story is fantastical it is never fakey.

Heck, I wish the sea creatures and books and movie posters in the film were real, so I could check them out! I love the cartoons, the music, the locales, the characters, the script, and Willem Dafoe is a fantastic treat. He really did steal the show, if that's possible given all the greats in this bunch.

The Criterion edition, with all the extras, almost satisfies my longing for a sequel or a TV show based on these characters.",1245974400,2,1289,4.504273504273504
1525016,4,B00005JNLQ,"I find this a hard movie to rate, but I gave it four stars because it was entertaining.  It's a odd film: one of these low-key black humor films which is a mixture of drama and comedy. What set this apart were a few other shocking scenes of violence, something not normally in this type of movie. For a comedy, albeit a tongue-in-cheek one, that violence doesn't seem to fit, but it makes the film all the more intriguing.

At times I was totally bored with this movie and at other times fascinated. I know one thing: this is a bizarre story! That automatically means it's a good vehicle for Bill Murray, who excels at wacky characters, even the low-key ones as he sometimes plays (i.e. Lost In Translation, The Royal Tenebaums, etc.). Speaking of the latter, this movie was written and directed by Wes Anderson, the same man who did ""Tenenbaums."" If you saw that, you have an idea of what you might get here, although I thought Royal Tenenbaums was funnier.

At 118 minutes, this a bit long for what it offers. I'd like to have seen it 15 minutes shorter with a tighter script. But it does offer some good photography in addition to the strange story. For the colors, I'd like to see this on Blu-Ray. This movie, as they say, is not for all tastes.",1236816000,,1249,4.421739130434783
1525017,4,B00005JNLQ,"The film is an obvious satire of the nature films popular in the 70's and 80's on TV and in theaters. The cast is a lot of well known actors and actresses, and instead of the film degenerating into an Hollywood glitz
piece of trash, it comes out funny and kind of really sad.
I think the success of the film has to be put on the shoulders of
Bill Murray who makes his megalomaniac character come alive.
Jacques-Yves (Jock) Cousteau and his boat Calypso would seem to be the main object of this satire.
Since he is dead and was actually a generation in advance of these people,
the people who imitate Cousteau are the ones taking the hit here.
I think it is a fun film with a pirate adventure,
that kids might enjoy;it is mostly just a silly film.",1233792000,,746,4.26056338028169
1525018,4,B00005JNLQ,"Writer/Director Wes Anderson goes for the Smart Laugh, not the Big Laugh. In fact, there were no big or small laughs throughout this flick. I didn't laugh out loud once--yet I was enthralled--laughing to myself, like Billy Idol, only laughing, not dancing, to myself.

This film is somewhat like an inside joke that is so inside that even your laughter is inside.

Steve Zissou: We were pretty good while we lasted, weren't we?
Oseary Drakoulias: Oh, we were like glory's gate, my darling. We were like that bloody shark of yours, we swam with the... oh, damn it, I had it on the plane.

Bill Murray as Steve Zissou really owned this movie. He was the flawed leader who can (usually) inspire his crew to follow them on the journey, the adventure, he was taking them on. He may not really know anything, he may be totally full of it--but still, he leads on. It is an adventure. Murray could convey so much with even his smallest throw away gesture.

Owen Wilson's character Ned Plimpton was a good and pure man of integrity--very different from his usual role. He also had what was supposed to be a Kentucky accent, but he's no Meryl Streep, nor is he a Will Patton, on whom the accent was based. He tried something different, and for that he is to be commended--but he was somewhat the fish out of water, in comparison to Murray, who was made to play Steve Zissou, or vice versa. Steve Zissou was written with Bill Murray in mind and according to Wes Anderson, it ""could have been no one else."" Anjelica Huston, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Cate Blanchett, Bud Cort, even Matthew Gray Gubler--all added a lot.

The film is a parody of the Undersea World of Jaques Cousteau, not just the oceanic exploration documentaries, but the whole preposterous idea of the Life Aquatic, the idea of doing scientific research while also making a film of it, and using the film to gain funding. While Jauques Cousteau's ship is called Calypso, Zissou's is called Belafonte, because Harry Belafonte was a calypso singer. Get it? This project seems to be from the point-of-view of a child watching Jaques Cousteau and dreaming of living the Life Aquatic, then a little more grown up, realizing what a strange life that would be. That concept is certainly realized in this movie, and I would recommend that you see this movie just because it is so different. But don't blame me if you expected the Big Laugh and got instead only the Smart Laugh, because I warned you about that.

Steve Zissou: Supposedly Cousteau and his cronies invented the idea of putting walkie-talkies into the helmet. But we made ours with a special rabbit ear on the top so we could pipe in some music.

And what music it was. Seu Jorge portrayed Pel dos Santos, a crew member who also strummed bossa nova guitar and sang David Bowie songs translated into Portuegese. He seemed to be playing David Bowie songs at every opportunity. Only they were played with a Brazilian back beat--in Portugese. All the David Bowie songs are arranged and sang by Seu Jorge. Except, like, ""Search and Destroy,"" by Iggy Pop, but even that was produced by David Bowie.

There were some really unusual shots interspersed throughout, and some animation that melded seamlessly with the live action footage. Candy flavored seahorses, blowfish, you name it, any kind of fish one could imagine, and Bill Murray flicks one of those wondrous creations off, like it were a bug, and maybe it is. Maybe it is.

Steller cast. Wonderful director, writer, and cinematographer. Amazing art. There is one set where you see the ship in cut away view. Is that all there is? Is that all there is? If that's all there is, then let's keep dancing. Bring on the booze and have a ball, if that's all... there is.

It doesn't take long for the announcement that Zissou plans to revenge his friend's death, but I could barely figure out what the plot was until I got about an hour into it.
Fortunately, the second half redeems this to the point of being an interesting story.  When Zissou announced the ""shortcut"" they were taking, it didn't take much thought to see it would go wrong, but the pirates' scene was one of my favorite parts of the movie.

There's also Bud Cort, fat and balding, as a kidnapped accountant, and Cate Blanchett stunning as a pregnant journalist. Owen Wilson, omnipresent on a Wes Anderson set, is there as Bill Murray's son, he's the weakest part of the film.

1525128,3,B00005JNLQ,"Wes Anderson's 2004 film THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU centers on the personal dramas of the title character (Bill Murray), a Cousteau-like oceanographer who feels like he has reached the end of his career. After a jaguar shark kills his partner, Zissou vows to go on one last adventure to hunt it and kill it. As he looks back on his womanizing private life, a young airline pilot (Owen Wilson) approaches him and suggests that Zissou may be his father. This budding father-son relationship unfolds among the struggles of Zissou's crew to reach the last known whereabouts of the shark.

Those who know Wilson's earlier films, especially THE ROYAL TENNENBAUMS of 2000, will recognize many similar themes, actors and humour here. The setting is ostensibly in our own time, but with much retro design. Furthermore, that design is extremely painstaking, with everything created bespoke for the film down to the little labels on stuff. There are complex personal relationships and failed marriages. And the soundtrack is quirky, this time to an even greater degree (Brazilian star Seu Jorge singing David Bowie translated into Portugese and playing the guitar).

However, there are some fresh new elements that keep this from being a mere repetition of his earlier comedy/dramas. There's even two shootout scenes, so Anderson certainly can't be hit with charges of making films where people just talk and talk in deadpan voices. A delightful visual touch are the fanciful sea creatures (stop-motion puppets, not CGI), and as I mentioned, the extremely intricate set design. Finally, whatever else one might think of the film, the cinematography of the helicopter crash scene deserves great praise for so subtly and gradually informing the viewer that something has gone horribly wrong.

Yet, for its general entertainment on a single viewing (and there are enough interconnections in the plot and dialogue to make a second viewing worthwhile too), THE LIFE AQUATIC strikes me as Anderson's most uncomfortable film to date. Of everyone here, only Steve Zissou is presented with any sort of depth. Owen Wilson's character is about as vague and featureless as the jaguar shark himself, just one more obstacle thrown in Zissou's path. Bill Murray had already honed this type of grim middle-aged moper many times before, reaching his finest hour with LOST IN TRANSLATION, but here (as well as in BROKEN FLOWERS) he's obviously gotten stuck in a rut as an actor. Klaus, the German first mate, is a lame ethnic cariacture played by an American actor.",1217808000,,2544,5.110576923076923

1525191,4,B00005JNLQ,"I recently watched this film for the second time (I first saw it when it was initially released on DVD) and I enjoyed it more the second time than I did the first.

The movie has an almost surreal, dream-like quality about it. Many of the sea creatures are stop-motion animated rather than CGI which sort of lends a tongue-in-cheek quality to the whole experience. The music (mostly David Bowie songs, but also a ""score"" that sounds like it was composed and performed on a $20.00 Casio keyboard - another quirky touch courtesy of Mark Mothersbaugh of ""Devo"" fame) doesn't really seem to fit into the context of the film, but somehow it just WORKS.

There are many pop (and not so ""pop"") cultural references and gags throughout the film, but you must keep a sharp eye and ear open for many of them (""Not this one, Klaus"" is a phrase that is obviously an homage to Francois Trauffaut's ""Jules and Jim"" - cute.)

I wouldn't say the film is laugh-out-loud funny, but there are many humorous turns of phrase and a few scenes of physical comedy than put a smile on your face. Bill Murray's deadpan delivery of his lines in fiendish. Zissou is a jerk, but you can't help but love him.

The set for Zissou's boat, the ""Bellefonte"" (another pop reference to Cousteau's own boat, the ""Calypso"") is obviously just that; a set. You can see how the actors are walking through doors to get from one room to the next depite the obvious fact that there are no walls on one side of all of the rooms. Another great ""surreal"" touch.

This movie may not be for everyone due to it's intense quirkiness, but I found it to be very original and a refreshing change of pace from the usual trash Hollywood likes to dish out on a regualr basis.

And, by the way, if Jacques-Yves Cousteau had been alive to see this film, I think he would have found it delightful and been honored by the tribute to him that this film obviously is.

I think this movie is vastly underrated I bought the criterion DVD and I have to say the picture looks fantastic on my 42 inch plasma, kudos to criterion for doing a great transfer.  Also, Anderson's persistent use of wide angles makes for great images on the flat screen. I think Anderson should use his talent for meticulous set design which is so rich in this movie, and consider doing a sci-fi movie.  I think the result would be incredible.  By the way, the DVD menu makes a great screen saver with a cutout of the Belafonte and the little dolphins floating around.
As for what makes this movie work for me the second time around: Bill Murray, David Bowie's music, and the deadpan humor.  There is a scene late in the movie between Jeff Goldblum and Bill, after the pirates have attacked and Bill (Steve Zissou) is at the mercy of his arch-enemy Hennessey (Goldblum) because his ship is dead in the water.  The tension that has been building between the two finally comes to climax in a restrained but hilarious way.  Watch what Goldblum does to Zissou's new pet.  Funny.  YOu need to be an active audience with Anderson's movies.  They challenge you because you must pay attention to the character's ulterior motives which are revealed through subtext (and set design).
Suffice to say, I rediscovered other such scenes which had me laughing (trust me it's hard to make me laugh).  Like the Big Lebowski, which I didn't like at first but came to realize had many layers of themes to explore, so my  feelings are the same for this movie.
I think this movie is Kafkaesque in the sense, that the humor is derived from horrible circumstances and character's trapped by their own insecurities...give it a second chance.",1196121600,2,1873,4.642424242424243

Then maybe from the brief description you will decide if this is a film you will enjoy. ""The Life Aquatic"" has a very simple storyline. Bill Murray plays Steve Zissou who is a famous oceangrapher who is going after the shark that killed his partner while shooting his documentry. The film itself uses alot of dry humor, if you are a fan of slapstick, then this film is not for you. What we get here is a excellent perfomance from Bill Murray, who is once again in great form. You will be seeing Murrays side of his humor that is more gentle and dry, more like his peformances in Rushmore, Kingpin, and Lost in Translation. If you are a fan of Murrays slapstick humor from the movies ""Meatballs"", ""Stripes"", or ""Ghostbusters"" then you might be dissapointed. The film also includeds a great supporting cast along with William Defoe who is in rare form as I believe a German assistant to Murray. The film does have some hangups, as it is really slow. I mean slow. It clocks in at around two hours, and it feels a bit longer because this movie depends all on dry dialoge and there is very else action wise that is happening. If they could have cut it down a bit, I wouldnt have complained, so its not perfect, but still a very good performance buy Murray and Defoe, and still very funny, if the dry type of humor is your thing.",1186358400,,1543,4.324137931034483
1525199,5,B00005JNLQ,"""The Life Aquatic"" is a movie that revolves around two main characters, Steve Zissou (Bill Murray), and Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson).  Both of these characters are likable in how off-center they are.  Zissou is an aging oceanographer, with all the vices of a sailor.  Plimpton is a Southern gentleman and a pilot.  These two people set off along with a crew to film and destroy a giant shark.

What gives this movie such a strange feel is the mixture of realism and absurdity.  Some scenes are hilarious in how ridiculous they are, while others show how brutal and fragile life can be on the ocean.  At times, it can leave the viewer a bit confused on what just happened.

So thinking back on ""The Life Aquatic"", I can best describe it as a strange sentimental movie.  It has alot of elements of humor, mixed with the peculiarities of the main characters, yet weighted with death and violence.  That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed it, and would recommend it to anyone who has an interest in the ocean.",1182816000,2,1001,4.604519774011299

Yes the fish look stupid, beautifully done but utterly fake looking. Yes Zissou smokes pot like a chimney, but he is utterly confident in his ability to come out on top. Being the ever sarcastic wise cracker Murray is at the top of his game here. I highly recommend it.",1181433600,,596,4.146551724137931

I understand this is one of those polarizing movies where people with good taste and a good sense of humor get it and love it, while lots of other people don't get it.  If you saw it and got it, then get this; or if you are into strange, odd, dark-ish, and/or interesting comedies, then check this out.

However, with a Anderson, Murray, Dafoe, and Goldbloom on board, it couldn't be that bad.

I'm glad I took the chance and bought the movie without having seen in.  I really liked Anderson's previous movie the Royal Tenenbaums, and I was glad to see that in this film, he continued on making a very specific style.  Although I think he has a great feel, viewers should be warned that it tends to have a rather polarizing effect(check out the other reviews on here),with not many in the middle ground.  Personally, I find the look and feel of his films to have a great flair and imagination.  The score is interesting as well, with the much discussed foriegn langauge versions of the Bowie songs.  However, to me I think some of the creatures they came up with show the spirit of the movie.  The scene that makes the movie to me is when the cast in under the sea in a small diving chamber watching a giantic ""leopard shark"" while a Sigur Ros track plays in the background.

They've got funding issues, interpersonal issues, mutiny issues, midlife crisis issues, love triangle issues, pirate issues... they're Team Zissou, and they're in search of Bill Murray's personal Moby Dick.

Talk about a movie that defies analogy and categorization; in plot and look and feel, it's not really like anything else out there. It's a feast, visually and musically; wonderful undersea footage (and stop-action animation), richly saturated colors, and a Bowie-based score with throw-ins from the Zombies, Bach, and Iggy Pop (of course, the Bowie cuts are all sung in Portuguese, so there!). The oversaturated colors and writer/director Wes Anderson's unconventional cuts (and a couple of truly amazing theater-style scenes on a cut-away version of the ship) give it a delightful but somewhat artificial feel, the feel I get from a well-done comic book; enjoyable but very clearly not `real' (which could of course spark the Film School 101 argument about what cinema is supposed to be, anyway...).

Yet it's also neither zany, nor nave, nor even melancholy; gently surreal, maybe, like a mild buzz from the joints Murray's character smokes throughout. Murray has nearly perfected droll-and-despairing; one reason the movie works so well is that its pacing matches Murray's perfectly. Anjelica Huston is, well, Anjelica Huston; Owen Wilson plays southern-sincere so syrupy that he's almost Leslie Howard; Cate Blanchett does okay with an interesting but oddly unfinished character; Willem Dafoe gets to turn his trademark intensity on its ear; and for heaven's sake it's got Jeff Goldblum and Bud Cort in the same movie!

I know I DO enjoy quirky comedy, and Bill Murray as well as a lot of the other cast seemed like they could pull something out of this crazy plot.

In my opinion, they do and then some. Zissou might not be entirely formulaic movie making, but it's not really the art/fringe film some might suggest. It's funny because it's always treading near the realm of nonsense, but there's still a strong plot (which is actually Zissou's relationships with his supposed son, his wife, his crew, and the world that once gave him a career and now has deserted him, not the more outlandish revenge against a shark.) Despite a slightly confusing ending that asks the age old tirade, ""why did they do that at the last minute to character X to make the end more dramatic"" it is a fairly warm and engaging tale of a very dysfunctional lot of mavericks that nontheless somehow find expertise through their combined strengths.

The humor is like if the satiricalness of Office Space and the fast paced dysfunction of Arrested Development mellowed out and smoked a joint, to tell the life of a much crazier Jack Cousteau and his crew.

So despite the commercial success of the film, Anderson's craftsmanship (not an overstatement: this film took two years to complete), The Life Aquatic, according to some, redeployed the familiar: the formalization of witticisms and dry humor. So, it has yet to join the critical ranks of Rushmore and The Royal Tennenbaums, for better or worse.

Noah Baumbach replaced Owen Wilson in the writing process, a director whose deapan appeal might complement the tragi-comic tone of Anderson's other films? Yes and no. While this movie is distinctively Andersonian--from the thematized daily log titles, to the intern named ""Nico"" (Nico, or  Christa Pffgen, is featured on at least one previous Anderson soundtrack) -- there does seem to be something missing.

1525417,4,B00005JNLQ,"I am a huge fan of Wes Anderson's debut effort, ""Rushmore.""  It was one of the most original, well-written, soulful comedies about teenage life (and our inability to grow beyond it) that I'd ever seen.  And ""Rushmore"" also had a great cast, led by perhaps my favorite actor of all time, Bill Murray.

But then came the follow-up, ""The Royal Tennenbaums,"" and Bill Murray was there once again.  It was not a coincidence that ""Tennenbaums"" is not in the same class as ""Rushmore"" either as a comedy or a film, and that it also put Murray off to one side, barely using him.  One was left to speculate about the possibilities of Anderson and Murray teaming up where Murray got the spotlight 100% of the time.

Those speculations were brought to fruition with ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou,"" and things are generally what you would expect from this team.  ""The Life Aquatic"" looks and sounds just like a movie one would expect from Max Fisher, the hero from ""Rushmore.""  It's a low-budget, slap-dash affair (watch the hilariously-amateurish gunfight scenes) with whimsical special effects and ludicrous stabs at tragedy.  But the blasting thing's got a heart, and its heart is in the melancholy, bemused visage of Bill Murray.

Murray plays the titular Steve Zissou, a minor-league Jacques Cousteau whose best years are both behind him and not all that great.  Murray captures Zissou as a man looking into the abyss of his own mortality and his own futility with an elan only he could muster.  Murray says more with a sidelong glance than many actors can evoke with a soliloquy, and for fans of this long-time great, ""The Life Aquatic"" offers many sterling moments.

But the rest of the movie, for all its heart and imagination, does not exceed the sum of its parts.  It's funny in the traditional Wes Anderson way, populated with people who have no idea how pathetic they really are.  And there are lines of brilliant comedy and insight.  But just like Aaron Sorkin's dialogue from ""A Few Good Men"" to ""The American President"" to ""The West Wing"" sounds exactly the same regardless of who is speaking the lines, the Wes Anderson motif is starting to wear a bit thin.  Particularly tiresome is Owen Wilson as a Kentucky Air pilot, whose southern-ness seems to play no role except for Wilson to fulfill some outmoded stereotypes.  And Willem Dafoe, God bless him, shoots for the moon with his German side-kick, but he brings rage and intensity to a movie where the rest of the cast seems so mellow that you have to believe they are more than a little ""baked,"" so he often seems to be coming from a different movie altogether.

If you love Bill Murray, or Wes Anderson, you will love ""The Life Aquatic.""  As much as big a fan as I am of Murray, I still can't rave about the movie.  But it is definitely worth your time, if only to see the magical wonder that is the Jaguar Shark.

All of these films feel like colossal wastes of great casts.  I don't think there's been a good comedy since A FISH CALLED WANDA in 1988 (although parts of THE BIG LEBOWSKI are hilarious) so I don't think we have a good scale of reference when it comes to comedies.  Most stink.  Maybe the current generation of moviegoers have no idea what makes a great comedy.  That might explain the glowing reviews here.

Although Anderson's films are competently made, they feel stuffy and pretentious.  Humorless.  I chuckled once per hour.  Not a good average.

1525419,4,B00005JNLQ,"I actually enjoyed this much more than I expected to.

At one level. this is a 2-hour ""what's wrong with this picture"" game.  Much of the humor is a matter of out-of-place or quirky things that just show up on screen, often for reasons that have not much to do with the plot.  It isn't necessarily subtle humor, on the whole, but it isn't loud either; this isn't much like Airplane! in feel, despite some formal similarities.  So you have a female crew member who walks around the ship topless, with no one remarking on it (Airplane! would have 20 jokes about it).  You have a crew member who sings David Bowie songs in a samba style, in Portuguese.  The underwater creatures are CGI'd to quasi-cartoon effect.  And Bill Murray, just by being what you'd expect him to be (though not in the sense of being overly predictable), is often not what you'd expect a character like the one he plays to be.  He's a Jacques Cousteau who has a suspect knowledge of marine biology and wants to pursue a new species of shark out of revenge, to kill it.

Much the same point could be made by saying this is a parody of Cousteau, with a bit of James Bond and human interest thrown in, but it's the kind of parody, like Galaxy Quest, that's also a fairly earnest example of what it parodies, though never completely so.  It's this mixing of earnestness and off-kilterness that gives the movie its peculiar chemistry.  The characters are close enough to real that we care about them and their concerns, and enjoy the film as parody, human drama and adventure.  Low-key parody, human drama and adventure, for the most part.  There is attention to detail, plenty of odd or just right characterization, set decoration, and other points to hold interest.

It may have helped that I came to this film with low expectations.  It's the kind of oddity that leaves many people cold, as you can see from the reviews.  But it has its charm, more overtly funny than Lost in Translation and less offensive to your higher sensibilities than a typical Leslie Nielsen comedy.

Watch the extras then enjoy this story of a Cousteau-esque documentary team who has seen better days (one of their crew has recently been eaten, the team is concerned about a wealthy competitor, and rivalries flare up internally when their leader's son appears).

It has a couple of funny jokes, but nothing that made me laugh-out-loud. I'm not sure how a movie like this doesn't work. Anderson co-wrote the script with Noah Baumbach (who wrote one of the best films of 2005, 'The Squid & the Whale') and look at the cast of the movie. The cast is wonderful...But,

""The Royal Tenenbaums"" had a wonderful cast too. The movie stars Oscar nominee Bill Murray (Best Actor, 'Lost in Translation') as the title character, Steve Zissou...An oceanographer. Zissou is famous for films he makes about his underwater expeditions, but lately his films have started to fail. Then, his best friend Esteban (Seymour Cassel, 'Rushmore') is killed by a mysterious, elusive, and possibly nonexistent Jaguar Shark. As he prepares to set off on a mission to hunt and kill the shark, Steve meets his son Ned (Oscar nominee Owen Wilson, Best Original Screenplay 'The Royal Tenenbaums'). Anyway Steve sets off with his crew Team Zissou to find the shark; Add in a hostage situation and a few shootouts and you have ""The Life Aquatic."" Additional cast members include Anjelica Huston ('Buffalo 66') as Eleanor Zissou, Steve's estranged wife and co-producer. Willem Dafoe ('The Boondock Saints') as Klaus, one of Steve's German team members. Oscar Winner Cate Blanchett (Best Supporting Actress, 'The Aviator') as a journalist named Jane Winslett-Richarson, who is writing an article about Steve. Jeff Goldblum ('The Fly') as Eleanor's ex-husband and Steve's nemesis Alistair Hennessey. There's others including Bud Cort ('Harold & Maude') and Michael Gambon ('Harry Potter & the Goblet of Fire'), so yeah...This movie has a cast that most directors would kill for. There's also one crew member who frequently strums David Bowie songs and sings them in Portugese. One of my biggest problems with Wes Anderson is that he works on a multi-million dollar budget and yet he makes his films look like independent films. Don't get me wrong, I love independent films. I just don't like wannabe independent films. This movie has a very cheap look to it, simalar to a documentary...Which is what Anderson was going for, I guess. The movie was fairly entertaining, but I keep expecting him to top ""Rushmore"" and am disappointed everytime he doesn't. Bill Murray and the rest of the cast are great and if you liked ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" you'll like this movie...But, for me, it just didn't click.

1525475,3,B00005JNLQ,"""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" is a film you have to work hard to like. It has so much potential: quirky characters, plotline and writing. In the end, it fails to reach the promised heights. But as with with the 3-legged dog featured in the film, I couldn't stop hoping that it would make the big jump, just this once.

The plot revolves around Steve Zissou, an oceanographer languishing in a ten-year slump. His films are amateurish, dull and unpopular. While filming his latest oeuvre, his best friend is eaten by a ""jaguar shark"" - a beast that many suspect exists only in Zissou's imagination. Zissou, hoping to avenge his friend and in the process restore his reputation vows to hunt down the shark.

The main drag on the action is the self-conscious posturing of the cast. Director Wes Anderson confuses deadpan delivery of lines with quirky comedy, and thus drains the personality from his characters. His writing must have looked terrific late at night on the page, but when transplanted to the screen, it is highly artificial.

The casting held great promise and included gems like Angelica Huston, Owen Wilson, Michael Caine and Willem Dafoe. Selecting Bill Murray for the lead role is perfectly in keeping with Anderson's smug approach to filmmaking. At his worst, Murray projects the smirking sense that he knows he is oh so funny; at his best, as in ""Lost in Translation,"" this deadpan approach conveys a sense of being lost and vulnerable. In ""The Life Aquatic,"" Murray oscillates maddeningly between these two modes. Only Cate Blanchett, playing a journalist writing a feature on Zissou, seems to have understood that a character's quirks come from the soul of a fleshed-out character - not from mannered posturing. When Blanchett joins the film about 1/3 of the way through, it finally comes to life.

TLA lost many opportunities to be a great film. Why, for instance, develop an oceangoing vessel, crew uniforms and a mission in the mode of Jacques Cousteau but fail to include any references to the French oceanographer? Or was that the joke? And what's with the crewman singing David Bowie songs in Portuguese? Or the script girl who appears topless - sometimes? Trs college film school.

Given my distaste for many of the scenes that made it into the film, I couldn't bear to watch the deleted scenes. A mini-feature on the cast and director was expectedly self-congratulatory. Or if you listen closely, you might notice the actors giving themselves qualified kudos, as when a parent praises a child's overloud music performance as ""really easy to hear!"" I can't exactly recommend the film, but found it fascinating in spite of its self-referential narcissism. Give it a whirl if you are looking for something offbeat yet unrealized.",1152144000,10,2759,4.9375
1525476,2,B00005JNLQ,"In ""The Life Aquatic"" Steve Zissou (Bill Murray), a colorful caricature of Jacques Cousteau, learns that he has a son (Owen Wilson) from a former lover, is left by his wife (Angelica Huston) and spends most of the movie looking for a giant shark that ate his partner.
Very cute at times but for the most part boring and somewhat pretentious.  That's how I described ""The Life Aquatic"" to a friend of mine.  After she saw the movie herself, she said that I was way too kind to it in my recommendation.  Sadly enough Wes Anderson has reached a point in his career (I hope it's just a phase) where he has no new ideas and his style (imagine French New Wave but filmed in luscious colors and taken to a cartoonish extreme) comes off as heavy-handed  and irritating.  Clearly, Anderson is trying to accomplish the same thing he did with ""The Royal Tenembaums"", by looking at human relationships under a magnifying glass through his use of outlandish, bigger than life characters.  I'm down with that.  However, everything he's trying to do with this movie, he already accomplished (infinitely more gracefully) in ""The Royal Tenembaums"".  There are many nice touches to this movie but all of them are superficial - beautiful sets, quirky costumes, absurd sea animal special effects (and even pirates!).  There is enough playful weirdness to keep the audience half awake, sometimes even giggling with delight (every time a new bizarre sea creature is introduced).  But for someone like Wes Anderson who clearly fancies himself a serious auteur, there is hardly any substance.  I grew up watching Jacques Cousteau so that whole angle made the movie more bearable.  But after a while this same aspect of the film becomes kind of pathetic - it's like watching a standup comedian whose whole routine is hanging by one good joke.  And what's with all the homophobic slurs scattered throughout the movie?  Is it supposed to be funny when someone uses a lesbian slur over and over again?  I wonder if Wes Anderson would find it acceptable to have his white protagonists constantly use the `n' word as a side gag.

Great musical score, great range of human existence from the most inane to the most profound. Illusions and perceptions are created, torn apart, and life is revealed in all of its chaotic glories.

In this venture THE LIFE AQUATIC, he takes his odd style, and tweaks it a bit, creating a sea faring adventure for the intellectual stoner type. ARRRR, yes there is pirates in it! And also multitudes of animated sea creatures, designed by the same team that did Tim Burtons Nigthmare Before Christmas.

Oh yeah, and Bill Murray is FUNNY! I really dig it. I was getting a little bored with the sullen, sulky roles he has been placed in (especially in the Wes Anderson roles). Here, he plays the title role of Steve Zissou, who is a wise cracking, not-so-smooth talking A-hole, who is trying to dig his ocean documentary making career out of the toilet.

A lot of strange quirks along the way, such as Seu Jorge, who appears sporadically throughout the film playing guitar and singing Portugese renditions of David Bowie songs. Where the hell did that come from? I don't know, but I like it. Also the supporting cast... Owen Wilson, Cate Blanchett, Willam Defoe, Anjelica Huston... and that funny looking dude from The Fly, give stellar performances. This was definately a cool movie, a little bit on a psychedelic tip. It had a ton of enjoyable moments, and Bill Murray, is FUNNY.",1150156800,2,1421,4.657370517928287
1525479,3,B00005JNLQ,"When I saw this film on opening night, I loved it.  I don't know what it was about it, but I adored it.  The acting was a lot better than that of the lifeless Royal Tenenbaums, I'll give it that, and of course, it has Bill Murray.

But months later, when I went all over this scumhole of a city (MIlwaukee) to find the 2-disc edition, I watched it again, and it didn't have the same effect one me.

The CGI animals are laughable, not necessarily creative, again, they're basically Anderson's ode to Kubrick's use of color.  The music was tiresome for the most part.  Maybe I'm just not hip enough to think singing David Bowie songs in french is funny, I found it annoying.

Some of the Anderson typicals return, Anjelica Houston and Bill Murray, of course, and Owen Wilson, who actually didn't have a hand in writing this film.  (It was co-written by Noah...something or other, the guy who directed the Squid and the Whale.)  The story is interesting, a 'burn-out' jacque costeau(sp?)-seque man beginning to realize how meaningless his life has become, that his fame has ultimately burned out completely, and then he finds out that a young man who approaches him one night may or may not be his son.

If there's one good thing I got from this film it was an admiration, no, a love for the work of Cate Blanchett, who almsot outshines Murray.",1148342400,2,1341,4.526970954356846

The story itself is very well put together and the actors really do fill their roles perfectly. Bill Murray is perfect in the lead as Steve Zissou, and Owen Wilson fits well as the ""son"" Ned.

The scenery of the film is just beautiful, ocean lovers will eat this film up. The movie takes place in the ocean and at the ocean, from the ocean floor to the ocean shore. The stop-motion animation of the sea animals are also an interesting choice for this film. Overall, this film is something not to be missed.

""Quirky"" doesn't even begin to describe ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou,"" a bizarre, completely off-the-wall comedy featuring a lead character who is a cross between Jacques Cousteau and Captain Ahab.  Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) is a world famous oceanographer and showman who has made a number of successful nature documentaries aboard his ship, The Belafonte.  However, in his last filmmaking venture, tragedy struck when his most venerable crew member was devoured by what Zissou describes as a ""jaguar shark.""  For the ""sequel"" to that film, Zissou sets off on a search for the killer of his friend, taking along with him a hostile woman reporter (Cate Blanchett) who is doing a magazine piece on his endeavor, a young man who claims to be his illegitimate son (Owen Wilson), and his usual assortment of crewmembers (including Willem DaFoe), cameramen and unpaid student interns.

Although there are a number of very witty moments in this film and some of the acting is absolutely on the money, ""The Life Aquatic"" runs out of steam fairly early on, unable to find the buying-in point that would actually make us care about either the story or the characters.  Writer/director Wes Anderson and co-scenarist Noah Baumbach maintain the tone of understated eccentricity fairly well, but the material just isn't rich or varied enough to sustain a near-two hour running time.

Murray once again proves himself the master of the deadpan delivery and the dry retort, while Blanchett, Dafoe, Angelica Houston and Jeff Goldblum offer superb support.  Only Wilson, whose Kentucky accent keeps mysteriously appearing and disappearing throughout the course of the movie, fails to rise to the level of the pros.",1144972800,8,1712,5.155234657039712

It straddles the edges of drama, comedy, adventure, and parody. If you can't handle that a movie can cut across each of these genres then you are not going to like this film. If you can handle it - it is going to take you on an emotional roller coaster - you are going to laugh, feel disgust, dislike for some of the characters and what they say and do (maybe all of them...), then some sadness, empathy, tinged with a bit of aw shucks. It's going to wow you, at the same time, with its intense coloration, in-joke animation, and brilliant score. It also smacks of late 60's early 70's cheesy B adventures - chiefly through its sets, costumes, cinematography and editing. There's a whole lot going on in The Life Aquatic that is so worthy of praise.  You will watch it over and over again and find new delights.  It's humble, dramatic, sensitive,  absurd, silly, funny, and beautiful on screen and in soundtrack. Yep, it is all this and it works - believe it!

The setup however is important and this is, in its own way, a comedic masterpiece.  Steve Zissou is a oceanographer who is widely thought a charlatan.  That is the essence of the first part of the movie-too much of the movie in most people's opinion.  The rest of the movie provides a venue for showing that he is not.  As my wife says, although he seems to be full of it as it were, what he does actually makes sense.  But it is the way this unfolds that makes the movie worthwhile.  In particular, Zissou's relationships with his current wife and his long lost maybe son are used to illuminate his character and, in the long run, to make him one of the strangest ""heros"" in a long time.  I guess the best way to communicate the positives of this movie is also a positive review: if you are looking for something different, and are not just looking for eye candy, check out The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou.",1140739200,9,1077,4.393939393939394

The story is simple but the characters are rich and complex and are played excellently by an ensemble cast.  Owen Wilson gives a quietly subdued performance, probably one of his best ever.

1525574,5,B00005JNLQ,"If you know you enjoy quirky `oddball' comedies, then this is definitely for you. After watching and really enjoying director Wes Anderson's prior works, especially the fabulous `Rushmore' I had to see this. With big names such as Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Cate Blanchett, Jeff Goldblum and Willem Defoe, I had great expectations, and I was not let down.

The plot is rather simple, evolving around great traveller/filmmaker Steve Zissou (Murray), almost a living legend for his documentaries on various journeys and the nature he finds. Unfortunately his recent works have slipped off the pace and looses his best friend to the mysterious `jaguar shark'. Zissou is then approached by Ned, a young admirer of Zissou's work who claims to his son. Zissou takes him on board as part of the merry crew. The rest of the film is how he, and his crew team up to find this shark, and basically aim to blow it to smithereens. Of course things don't really work out; the crew get into all sorts of mess, lack of funding, awkward cloudy father-son relations, crew division, crazy pirates...its shambles, but extremely hilarious...not in a slapstick way but in Anderson's unique quirky style.

The acting is simply great throughout the cast. Bill Murray pretty much steals the show; he is in fine form as the melancholic, sarcastic `has-been' that's desperately trying to re-invent himself. He is always trying to cut corners and force himself into the gleaming popularity of his old self, he looks for the father-son relationship creating brilliant tense and awkward conversations. Owen Wilson, while not being as rip-roaringly funny as he can be, is a vital part of the film. Without given any silly or slapstick type humour to work with, he flexes his acting muscles perfectly as the calm, subdued and often nave Ned. Willem Defoe is simply hilarious, playing a highly-strung German, a nice surprise that gave many laughs throughout the film. Cate Blanchett is very solid, playing the woman that rather comically both ""father and son"" (if they can be called that) go for. She is subtle and always brings gentler, more calming side to the film, balancing the eccentric humour that often overwhelms.

This film will not please all people, for some it's a unique, weird and wonderful piece of film making, for others it's a completely lame piece of crap. If you think you have an open mind and want something completely different to the normal comedy, this is highly recommended.",1137628800,,2467,4.954106280193237

1525576,4,B00005JNLQ,"LIfe Aquatic follows celebrity oceanographer Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) as he and his team of miscellaneous hangers-on mount an expedition in pursuit of the beautiful but dangerous ""jaguar shark"".

This strangely beautiful film painstakingly illuminates the delights and dangers of hero worship.  One of many serendipitous choices in Life Aquatic is the star-studded cast, each of whom is a jaguar shark in their own right.  We all know magnetic personalities like Steve Zissou - whether the person is Steven Spielberg or the CEO of a high-tech startup the same warning applies: there is danger for those who live in the orbit of someone with ""rock star"" appeal.  It must have been a sly pleasure for the cast to do this film warning their own public against following too closely.

Brilliantly unformulaic, Life Aquatic makes uncommon demands on the viewer.  Deadpan irony saturates the script and is delivered without winks.  Hilarious sight gags flow by without the camera drawing attention to them, as when Zissou's filming of a solemn little monologue is upstaged by a gorgeous killer whale mugging shamelessly behind him.  Like many charismatic leaders, Zissou creates a world of his own, and the intensely stylized staging and sometimes stunning visuals give us both the intense delights and claustrophobia of living there.

1525577,5,B00005JNLQ,"With his third major motion picture, Wes Anderson proves that he still doesn't give a damn what anybody thinks about him. The Life Aquatic is as eccentric, fresh and original as Anderson's previous films - Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums - and for my money, it's also the most solid of the three. This time, Bill Murray, who played a supporting role in both those films, is given the lead. Murray, who - partly thanks to Anderson - transformed in recent years from semi-washed up comedian to independent cinema's sweetheart (through appearances in films including, other than Rushmore, Sofia Coppola's Lost In Translation and Jim Jarmusch's Broken Flowers) creates one of the most wonderful characters of his career with celebrity undersea explorer Steve Zissou, clearly a tribute to the late Jacques Yves Cousteau, a classic anti-hero who is both despicable and absolutely lovable, which perfectly compliments Murray's renowned talents.

Murray is not the only talent on board - The Life Aquatic boasts one of the most impressive ensemble casts seen in some time, one which includes Anjelica Huston, Willem Dafoe, Owen Wilson, Jeff Goldblum and Cate Blanchett, among others, all of whom give knockout performances. The fantastic actors, though - all perfectly cast - are just one piece of the puzzle in Anderson's vision, and The Life Aquatic, underneath a somewhat chaotic and disorganized surface, is a solid and steady film that bears the signs of a complete and well-thought out piece, assembled in its entirety in Anderson's mind - from the highly stylized visuals, the often dated, even campy, but very aesthetic, special effects, including animated sea-life by grand master of claymation Henry Selick (James and the Giant Peach, The Nightmare Before Christmas), to the unpolished dialogue, to the soundtrack, a large part of which being Portuguese versions of David Bowie songs, translated and performed by Seu George (City of God), who also plays in the film.

The Life Aquatic is certainly not for everyone, and if you're looking for the Bill Murray of Caddyshack and Ghostbusters you'll be disappointed by the low joke ratio. If you enjoyed Anderson's previous works, by all means you should watch this one too. If you're open minded and are interested in cinema that is a little different, if you like directors like Terry Gilliam and the Coen Brothers, you should definitely give it a shot - maybe you won't get into the spirit of the thing, you might find it dumb and boring, but you should give it a shot - you may just find one of the freshest and most original films of the last few years.",1135900800,5,2608,4.979357798165138

Other reviewers found the claymation styling retro, and maybe I missed the point there, but I found the plot to be non-existent,  and the actors seemed to be lost trying to figure out where their characters were supposed to be or do.

The casting director deserves a big award for perfectly casting Bill Murray as the mostly washed up main character Steve Zissou. Inspired (mostly through parody) by legendary sea explorer Jacques Cousteau, Zissou runs a ramshackle  sea exploration outfit filled with a crew that has no background in deep sea diving or marine biology. They make documentaries about their ""adventures"" in oceanography. These hilariously stilted productions, featured throughout the movie, look barely better than home movies. Their incompetence becomes evident very early. Worst of all, the movie in which Zissou's best friend, Esteban, gets eaten by a ""Jaguar Shark"" comes across as a fake. In defiance, Zissou sets out to kill the shark that ate his friend. Along the way his rich wife leaves him, his alleged son (who works for ""Air Kentucky"") appears out of nowhere, they break into a competitor's sea lab and steal valuable equipment, their ship gets invaded by pirates in unprotected waters (Zissou knowingly leads them there and some interns get shot at), and they attempt to rescue the competitor that they stole from. Zissou comes across as a hopeless reprehensible greedy womanizing good for nothing. The film tries to take this character with all of his flaws and save him. The end of the movie reveals whether or not Zissou gets the redemption he seeks. He walks away into the Italian street with a child on his shoulders followed by a large crowd accompanied by David Bowie's ""Queen Bitch"" with its chorus blaring ""I can do better than that"". In other words, ""The Life Aquatic"" represents a character study of a single character. Zissou gets full multi dimensional treament. Consequently, the supporting characters remain somewhat two dimensional and undeveloped. But they all have a direct effect on Zissou as he carries out his mission. The plot focuses almost exclusively on whether or not Zissou can come out ahead with a load of expanding moral baggage on his back. In other words, ""The Life Aquatic"" deals with redemption.

The film includes an impressive cast. Not only Bill Murray, but Cate Blanchett, Willem DaFoe, Anjelica Houston, and Jeff Goldblum. Blanchett was actually with child while filming (Nicole Kidman apparently vied for her part). Many great CG creations of imaginary sealife also make numerous appearances. These help emphasize that we're watching a fiction and a parody. Some of these amazing underwater creatures look right out of a medieval bestiary. Also, an amazing cutaway set of the ship was created for select scenes. These scenes play like theater as continuous tracking shots scan the massive structure in real time (and proclaim that the kitchen ""contains the most technologically advanced equipment on the ship"").

Though it's ultimately dry, deadpan, and likely has limited appeal, ""The Life Aquatic"" represents a refreshing change from the typical ""screwball"" comedies, stale remakes, and gushing heart melting romantic comedies churned out by Hollywood these days.

In fact, after meandering thru this film's plot and style, the fate of the dog ruined what goodwill and open-mindedness I had left.  Bill Murray and all the actors in the cast, don't seem to have anything to do, as long as they got the lines and hit their marks.  Anjelica Huston is spectacularly thrown away in a way I wouldn't have thought possible, she is basically a prop, and how can that happen with someone so charismatic?  Cate Blanchet is one of the great actresses of our time, but here I kept going is it Aussie or is she sticking us with a Brit accent?  Whichever, sometimes I felt she was doing Kate Hepburn again, and wondered if that misdirection was the point.  As this film doesn't seem to know what it is supposed to be, or perhaps it is supposed to be everything.  Willem Dafoe?  How'd he get in this mess?  And David Bowie's music throughout, a little bit of Bowie goes a long way, especially when you can't figure out how the song is applicable for the part of the story in which we're being serenaded.  The whole film comes off as a self-conscious attempt to produce a cult classic, but a true cult classic aspires to be greater than what it's fate is, it doesn't set out to be a cult classic to begin with, but a great movie.  (The same situation as Buckaroo Bonzai, actually, a would-be cult classic.)  The redeeming feature to the screenplay is the Bill Murray character's sudden need in his mid-life crisis to establish an intimate relationship with a son, whether the son is the genuine (genetic) or assumed article, as the parentage is assumed, rather than taken as fact.  And the son seems to require the same assurance/security on his own, which is what leads him to be part of the current voyage.",1135209600,8,2232,4.575376884422111

This movie is a spoof on the classic ""Jacques Cousteau"" type character.  Think how Captain James T. Kirk was spoofed in Galaxy Quest.  [As an aside, a national survey on movies/TV shows that influenced a generation of American adults showed that The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau was very influential, surpassing Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom, Bambi, and others.]

Steve Zissou (aka Bill Murray) is a half con, half serious marine explorer.  The magic of this movie is not Zissou's adventures, however.  The magic is that the movie starts off sloppy, weird, dumb, and slap-sticky.  There is almost a ""this movie is too stupid to watch any further"" moment.

Then... you are captured in the story, and you can't believe what is happening, is happening.  It is the magic of a great writer and director that makes this happen.  It will leave you feeling that you've been affected by the magic of movies.",1134604800,4,1078,4.857142857142857
1525653,4,B00005JNLQ,"`The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou' co-written and directed by Wes Anderson is Anderson's third film starring Bill Murray. It's a genre parody somewhere between the slapstick style of Mel Brooks in `Blazing Saddles' and `Young Frankenstein' and the much more humanly telling style of Woody Allen in `Shadows and Fog' and `Zelig'. And yet, Anderson seems to have carved himself a wholly new approach to parody, as no one would confuse this film with the works of Brooks or Allen.

I have been a major Bill Murray fan since I saw him in `Meatballs', after his movie debut in `Caddy Shack' and his major starring roles in `Stripes' and `Ghostbusters'. And, I think Murray makes this picture work, but I suspect that even his star power is not quite enough to lift this movie into the same league as either Anderson's previous picture, `The Royal Tenanbaums' or Murray's best recent role in `Lost in Translation'. The first thing I feel about the movie is that it wastes the talents of Anjelica Huston, Willem Dafoe, and Jeff Goldblum. I have seen Huston in a small part in Woody's `Crimes and Misdemeanors', and I did not feel her talent was wasted, as Allen made such good use of her time on the screen. As the second lead, Owen Wilson does well, especially with his atypical role and his great Kentucky accent. And it is such a pleasure to see Cate Blanchett in a very human role, after her stint as the elven queen, Galadrial in `Lord of the Rings'. Expert character actors Michael Gambon and Bud Cort also seem to occupy weakly conceived roles.

One thing I believe about this movie is that it has lots of very funny moments, mostly, but not exclusively from Murray's lines and business. It's parody of French oceanographic icon, Jacques Cousteau is simply brilliant, and the basis of much of the best comic lines. I think the main problem is that it neither starts nor ends on a firm footing. It almost seems as if the film combines two or three totally unrelated stories, and none of the three are cleanly introduced or resolved.

The most important story line is the death of Steve Zissou's partner in the jaws of a rare large Jaguar shark. We are never really introduced to this character and his relation with Zissou is never established before his demise. The second story line lies with the appearance of a supposed Zissou son (Owen Wilson). While there is much speculation on whether Zissou knew of his son before the son's appearance, this line of dialogue is never resolved. It is even complicated to the point of total obscurity by Zissou's wife (Houston) confiding with journalist Blanchett that Zissou shoots blanks and can therefore not be the father to anyone.

The third story line is the very thin financial basis of Zissou's oceanographic / documentary enterprise, leading to the arrival of insurance bonding representative Cort, who we never even see in closeup. This plot line includes an incredibly improbable hijacking of Zissou's ship by a gang of Filipino pirates, repelled from the vessel by Zissou singlehandedly, using nothing more than an incredibly improbable number of shots from what is probably a nine (9) shot Glock handgun, in the face of the dozen pirates' submachine guns.

This DVD includes one of my very favorite features, a voiceover commentary by the director and his co-writer, but even this feature doesn't totally save the movie for me, as the commentators simply don't follow the events on the screen. The commentary does introduce a bit of inadvertant humor in that it becomes more and more evident that it was recorded in the middle of a busy restaurant, with every imaginable ambient restaurant noise showing up in the commentary sound track.

In spite of these problems, this movie is worth seeing for some of the great comic business and some of the inventiveness of the Cousteau / oceanographic parodies. The parodies of some nominally real sea life may alone be worth the price of admission. I suspect that if Mel Brooks or Woody Allen had done the same story, it may not have had as many laugh out loud funny gags, but it would have had a cleaner plot resolution, especially since Anderson's way with actors is a lot fresher than Brooks or Allen.

A pleasure for Bill Murray fans, but no `Ghostbusters'!",1134259200,2,4258,4.7771739130434785
1525741,5,B00005JNLQ,"I must say, I was prepared for something different the first time I sat down to watch The Life Aquatic, but not quite *this* different.  This is definitely one of the most odd American movies to get a wide release in the past decade, right up there with Adaptation, The Big Lebowski, and of course Anderson's previous Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums.  It starts out with an offbeat revenge plot--Cousteau-like oceanographer Steve Zissou seeks to find and kill the ""jaguar shark"" that ate his longtime friend and collaborator Esteban--but it gradually evolves into a seafaring adventure that's heavy on innovation and introspection.  The Life Aquatic may even be Anderson's best movie yet (discounting Bottle Rocket, which I have yet to see)--it's more complex and nuanced than Rushmore, and not quite as self-consciously weird as The Royal Tenenbaums, or at least not as distracting in its weirdness.  Even more than those movies, this one can occasionally feel like a lark, but its relative aimlessness is just part of its low-key charm, and it never disguises the film's ample heart.

The humor is absolutely nothing like what you'll get in the typical broad Hollywood comedy, as the comedic timing is off-key and the jokes are generally delivered in the most deadpan of voices (especially pretty much all of Bill Murray's jokes), but The Life Aquatic is still a very funny movie, even if you might have to watch it more than once to pick it all up.  Just as important, and what sets it apart from Anderson's previous work (and just about everything else), The Life Aquatic looks absolutely incredible.  Anderson & Co. obviously put as much thought into the look and feel of this film as they did the plot and characterization, as it's a visual stunner of the first order: awash in color, brilliantly lit and imaginatively shot, and filled with all sorts of exotic marine life.  Even the fast-paced, frenetic gunfight scenes are lovingly staged.  And since the whole adventure is being filmed, there are some opportunities for a nifty movie-within-a-movie effect, which Anderson manages to pull off without ever stooping to gimmickry.

As I (and others) have already noted, The Life Aquatic isn't a ""normal"" movie by an any means (although normalcy is overrated anyway), but it's all pulled off with Anderson's trademark emotional depth, and populated with characters that are largely believable in spite of their eccentricities.  At the movie's center is one of recent film history's more unlikely love triangles: Bill Murray as Steve Zissou himself, Owen Wilson as his could-be son and new collaborator Ned, and the impossibly cute Cate Blanchett as Jane, the pregnant, no-nonsense reporter who accompanies Steve and his crew on their mission to find the jaguar shark.  Zissou, and Murray's portrayal of him, is essentially a reprise of Herman Blume from Rushmore--aging, disaffected and emotionally repressed, looking for some companionship and understanding as he reaches his midlife crisis--but Murray once again succeeds in making his character sympathetic, turning in yet another brilliantly understated performance.  Even now, in the ""mature"" stage of his career, Murray is funny, but now he's added an ability to convey more with a few unaffected lines and a facial expression than most actors could with a whole movie worth of emoting.  I swear, if Hollywood ever makes a movie about Shaquille O'Neal, I'd buy Murray in the role of Shaq without hesitation.

Ned, whom he meets at the movie's outset, clearly provides Zissou with a chance at redemption in the face of his declining prestige and deteriorating marriage, although even then Zissou remains ambivalent about the massive change in his life his (probable) son represents.  This ambivalence is only compounded when Steve and Ned both develop a ""thing"" for Jane, whose own issues make her somewhat of a kindred spirit for the two of them.  Plus, there's the resentment Ned engenders in Steve's Germanic sidekick Klaus (the great Willem Dafoe), and Steve's ongoing rivalry with the grant-hogging Alastair Hennessy (the equally great Jeff Goldblum) to complicate things.  Oh, and there are some pirates thrown into the equation just for good measure as well.

Perhaps the most striking aspect of this movie is just how difficult to classify it is, definitely more so than Rushmore and arguably than The Royal Tenenbaums as well.  There are comedic, romantic, dramatic, and fantastic elements to be found (not to mention the aforementioned gun battles), but at the same time The Life Aquatic doesn't quite fit the mold of a comedy, drama, romance, or fantasy.  Since I like this movie so much, I like to think its difficulty to pigeonhole is what accounts for all the negative reactions it's generated.  But whatever the case, I found The Life Aquatic to be a trip, and the kind that gets better with repeated viewings.  It's not always down to Earth, but given the current constitution of reality, an occasional flight of fancy is to be greatly appreciated.",1134172800,4,5026,5.080194410692588
1525742,5,B00005JNLQ,"Possibly the biggest complaint about The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is that people claimed it's writer/director, Wes Anderson, was refusing to grow as a film maker by setting himself in the same melancholic, surreal, yet oddly warm atmospheres that his earlier masterpiece, The Royal Tenenbaums, had already occupied.  This statement is partly true, to the extent that it is easy to tell that The Life Aquatic and Tenenbaums were made by the same director.  But that makes Wes an autuer, not a bad film maker.  Are not Ingmar Bergman's films all filled with the same angsts and styles and actors?  And Tarkovshy's style is consistent through all his work as well.  And of coarse you have Hitch, who had the unimitable style that was very very consistent in all his work.  Consistent style and theme is not a bad thing, it helps define a director.  And the remark that Wes is stuck in his past masterworks is off key. The Life Aquatic is a wholly original work,  one that expands his ever evolving style and draws up fantastic new avenues for his themes.  More so than most people give it credit for at least.

The film offers many wonderous images and experiences.  The underwater scenary is simply breathaking, and features Wes' imagination at a creative peak.  It also has glorious camerawork, shot by master cinematographer Robert Yeoman, and easily Wes' most graceful, flowing camera to date.  And as always the shots are precisely framed with his signature beauty.  The biggest stylistic invention for the film (something new for Wes!) was the forced artificiality of everything.  Take the cutaway shot of the Belafonte, which looks half like a theatrical play and half like a human antfarm, and that is exactly the point.  This film is a study of how humans interact with each other and reach out to one another, or how they don't.  Many films are about that as well, that theme is nothing new, however in putting it into these terms and showing it this way, with many of the sets seeming very theatrical as if it is a play for us, (note the very first two images) the audience sees this theme displayed in a new, creative way.

The theme of isolation is shown in other brilliant ways as well, such as when Steve gets punched walking out of the Film Festival.  When his bag with the ""Crayon pony fish"" becomes ruptured, he takes someone's glass and puts the sea creature in the glass, and then lifts it above the crowd.  This could be a metaphor for Steve, a beautiful strange sea creature being kept and isolated from everyone.

Despite the complaints that i have tried to render pointless, there are some that have some solid ground.  The only ""real"" character is Steve Zissou.  Now there are numerous cinematic explantions for the reason; however, unlike my argument before, even with those arguments, the other characters are still secondary at best and shadowy at worst.  I don't have a problem with that, although many do, and i can respect that.

There are a thousand things I could say about this magnificent film; however an Amazon review might not be the best place for All of them.  I would recommend the DVD commentary that Wes and co-writer Noah Baumbach give.  It helps in understanding the film.  So does the tv extra Monda Monda, also on the double disk dvd.  It's in italian; however, most is translated and that expands the understanding of the picture as well.

All in all, I'd bet with about anyone that The Life Aquatic will be one of those misunderstood films upon first release, only to be considered a cinematic masterpiece with fifteen to twenty years.  Only time will tell on that one; however, I'm happy calling it that now.",1133395200,3,3661,4.718110236220473

This time it is Bill Murray with the best part as oceanografer Steve Zissou, embarking on another mission to make a documentary, this time also to kill the shark that ate his friend.

The other characters are mostly cartoon characters, some traits and always in the same outfit with corresponding things that make the person more real.

There are some very funny special effects with fluorescent lights  as well. Music, which in the other Anderson movies has always had an important role, doesn't figure as much anymore as an atmosphere setting (except maybe one of the final scenes with a great Sigurr Ros track).

Half of the time, I had no idea what the heck was going on. The scenes are thrown together and not well organized. The cast of characters are from moment to another running off to go here and there. Bill Murray really cannot act and could not carry the role of captain of the ship and its ecletic crew. Angelica Huston's character was too 2-D and unemotional. Maybe it was too much in media res. There was just too much to grasp. I thought that the Indian actor who plays Murray's butler in The Royal Tannenbaums would have been a better captain of this crazy hodge-podge crew.

On the other hand, I liked how Anderson was trying to show how this group of unremarkable, regular folks, completely unqualified to undertake the expeditions of the ship, go out and seek adventure in the wide unknown, meanwhile a group of unpaid interns tag along to gain credit for partaking in such crazy disorganized, unscientific expeditions. It's kind of exemplary of life. You can sit on your couch and watch life go by, or you can go out and seek an adventure of your own, even if you don't think you're completely ""qualified,"" or good enough, or as an intern, you can tag along and earn credit. Life is yours for the making. Sometimes all it takes is a love for something and drive to make it happen.

1525811,5,B00005JNLQ,"It would be nearly impossible for this film to excede its predecessor. For those of you who don't know, that was ""The Royal Tenebaums"". But if you go into this film not looking for the greatest film of your life, your expectations will be greatly surpassed.

I will admit that this is the most ""love it or hate it"" of Wes Anderson's films. He is truly testing the limits of what his audience will or won't accept. I will be even more honest and say that the first time I saw this film I did not like it that much. I was greatly diappointed, but I think that was only because I had my expectations so high.

Now that I have got all of that out of the way I can go on to actually talking about the film. This is quite a work of art. Bill Murray continues his uncanny run of great performances here as the title character. Steve Zissou is not the type of character that most people will root for. He is a washed up documentary filmmaker who is unfaithful to his wife, drinks too much, and is mean and nasty most of the time to those around him. It could have been a danger to put this type of character at the center of your film, but Wes Anderson, who should be mentioned with Renoir when it comes to blending comedy and tradgedy, does the job.

Owen Wilson co-stars as Ned Plimpton. Wilson, a frequent Anderson partner, is wonderful here. Although I would say that Wilson's specialty is comedy, he plays it mostly straight here. He may or may not be the son of Zissou. That is not important in the long run. Ned is there to progress the Zissou character himself. Zissou says early in the film that he hates fathers and never wanted to be one. He grows to love Ned, as much as a man like that could love anyone. There are truly some touching moments between the actors.

There is plenty of comedy too. Willem DeFoe gives his most loose performance as Klaus, a Zissou crew member who always seems to think that he is left out of everything that is important. The great Seymour Cassel scores a few laughs in his brief role as Esteban, Zissou's long time partner and best friend in the nautical journeys. Anjelica Huston gives another great performance as Zissou's wife Eleanor. Huston, the greatest living American actress, shows again that she is capable of playing any role presented to her. Also hilarious is Seu Jorge as Pele. The guitar playing crew member who only knows David Bowie songs. His performances echo throughout the movie and he really can sing and play. On the DVD, there is a special feature that has the full performances of all of Jorge's songs.

""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" is a great film. The more that it is viewed the more its complexities will be aparent to the viewer.

1525813,3,B00005JNLQ,"I fear someone involved with the making of this film knows the real Jacques Cousteau, and is telling it like it was. ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"", is 60's landmark TV's ""The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau"", seen through a psychedelic prism, into an alternative underwater world where drinks are tipped, pot is smoked, sharks are hunted down for revenge, and the underwater exotics are revealed as childlike-drawn animated caricatures. Like the baby boomers in this film, I'm a little troubled that the scientific, fatherly Cousteau, patrolling the ocean depths in his cool submarine, discovering aquatic wonders and mysterious marine life, may have been more a manic Square Pants Sponge Bob, than the man most likely to seriously fulfill a Mr. Limpit fantasy. Granted, this film isn't ABOUT Jacques Cousteau, but then, why was it even made, if not to reveal the Hollywood cocktail stories that likely were told about him and his underwater expeditions? So be it. If you have a soft spot in your gill for Cousteau, you have to admire it. It seems you can catch a sea breeze of the real man somewhere in the chaos. It's scenic, funny, bizarre, and although it suffers from the dreaded, 'just-how-long-is-this-movie?' reach for the DVD cover, you can't easily look away. I suppose I object to the tragic consequences befalling the only young, virile character, and the pirates invading the ship seemed too brutal, but we need be reminded what beautiful melodies David Bowie writes, and the acoustic Portuguese versions of his songs were exceptional.

1525814,3,B00005JNLQ,"Synopsis: Steve Zissou, an underwater explorer and maker of documentaries, sets out on one last journey to hunt down the (possibly mythical) jaguar shark that killed his longtime friend and collaborator. The best years of his skill and popularity long behind him, his marriage on treacherous ground, Zissou takes fresh encouragement from the appearance of a young man, Ned Plimpton, who may be his son by an old lover. But he will need all the help he can get to make it through this quest - beset by debt, monitored by a hostile reporter and a bond company stooge, waylaid by pirates, and mocked by his own decrepit boat.

I find that The Life Aquatic works a lot better for me if I don't think of it as a movie. A movie is usually, after all, something that belongs to a particular genre, has a fairly consistent tone, and eventually achieves the handful of manifest goals that it sets out to reach. At least, a good movie does those things; and while I'm not inclined to call this film bad, well, it just doesn't work that way. It's more like a large banquet, with a wildly improbable mix of edibles. Some of them are to your taste, some not; but after a nibble or two at the bad ones you can leave them on a discarded dish with no harm to your palette, and still enjoy the rest until you are full.

The oddest taste at this feast is the film's eccentric mix of tones. Is it an action movie? There is some violence - gunplay with a band of pirates, blood in the water from a shark attack, kidnappings, a number of deaths (nearly all offscreen) - yet there's a wierdly tongue-in-cheek air to it all. And in the parts of the movie that take place underwater, instead of James Cameron realism we get a stylized, Barney-like fairyland replete with hummingbird fish and a rhinestone-studded jaguar shark.

Is it a movie about relationships? There's much grist for that as well, yet very little appears resolved between the characters by the time the credits roll. Is it farce? Drama? It's impossible to say when both are present in equal measure.

Something similar is going on with the sets. When characters move from one place to another in Zissou's boat (the Belafonte), or in the seaborne laboratory of Zissou's competitor, Hennessey, the camera doesn't follow them through the tight passages as it might in another movie. Rather, we view them from the side as they wind through a kind of cutaway set. It's hard to explain - you have to see it - and though it's kind of cool, it's hard to square with the more naturalistic style in other parts of the film. It's almost as if The Life Aquatic were half stage play and half movie.

And then there are those touches that are just, well, pointless. Like the Team Zissou mate whose primary function appears to be singing and playing acoustic renditions of David Bowie songs. In French. Or the fact that all members of the team are supposed to wear red stocking caps and Glock pistols. Huh?

The more toothsome aspects of The Life Aquatic are mostly related to the characters, and they are a rare combination of actors indeed. As the feature writer who tags along on Zissou's adventure, Cate Blanchette brings warmth and multi-dimensionality to a sketchily written role. Michael Gambon, as Zissou's benevolently unhelpful financial partner, inhabits that breezy sort of indolence on which British actors appear to have cornered the market. And the divine Anjelica Huston employs her cool disdain and formidable cheekbones to dazzling effect as Zissou's estranged wife, Eleanor.

That is not to say that the movie is uniformly well-cast or well performed. The biggest disappointment is Owen Wilson as Zissou's maybe-son, Ned. In Wilson's defense, the part is not strongly written; its primary flavor is diffidence. Still, where a better actor might give the role a bit more texture, Wilson sticks to the generic kind of little-kid vulnerability that he's done before. Willem Dafoe is bizarrely cast as a German member of Team Zissou who jealously guards his place in the pecking order and resents the appearance of Ned. The performance is crudely rendered and tends to lurch a bit from one posture to the next.

Finally there's Bill Murray. Like Mel Gibson a few years ago, Murray has recently gone on a bender of making films - including Lost In Translation and this year's Broken Flowers - whose primary subject is himself. Murray has been more successful at it than Gibson, though, because as well as we think we know him, he always manages to show us something subtly new. This time around, like the underwater explorer he plays, Murray guides us down successively through the layers of his previously-revealed characters - the cad, the slacker, the rule-breaker, the reconstructed jerk, and so on - finally revealing an ambivalent father, a timidly-appreciative husband ... and in the magical depths of the ocean, a wonder-struck child. It's his performance that ultimately tips the scale in favor of this very singular movie.",1127779200,6,4976,4.771196283391405
1525815,4,B00005JNLQ,"And the award for Weirdest Movie of the Millennium thus far goes to The Life Aquatic!

Wes Anderson once more takes us on a satisfyingly trippy, nicely bittersweet and beautifully-directed journey right into the heart of experimental mainstream cinema, and, while this movie isn't as tight or together as The Royal Tennenbaums, it's still very rewarding and very worthwhile.

The plot: Steve Zissou is an oceanic documentary maker in the mould of Jaques Cousteau, who is down on his luck in more ways than one. His company's going broke, his marriage to the enigmatic Elanor (Anjelica Huston in perfect casting, once more) is on the rocks and his nemesis, the oddly fey Alistair Hennessey (Jeff Goldblum, in a great and sympathetic comic role), is lapping his failures up. Most pressingly, his business partner and friend Esteban has been gobbled up by an unknown variety of sea beast, and Zissou's quest for revenge is the premise of the movie. Along the way he acquires an unknown son Ned (Owen Wilson) and a ballsy reporter Jane (Cate Blanchett) as unlikely shipmates, and the movie goes from there.

Performance-wise, while nobody in particular stands out, everyone is excellent, and Murray and Huston have a great onscreen chemistry as a waspish couple. Willem DeFoe is wonderful as the teutonic first mate and Cate Blanchett is a joy to watch as the tough-yet-tender Jane. The performances are predictable and standard Anderson fare, but excellent and multi-layered nonetheless.

Direction's similarly excellent, the use of colour and whimsical child-like sets and animations are both original and appealing. There's a real sense of life to the visuals, and to give Anderson credit, his seemingly low-budget special effects work extremely well, given the context of the characterisation and premise. Sure, the story is slow-moving (even a little too long?), but when there's such a quirky feast for the senses on offer, it doesn't matter. Dramatic action-comedy romances are hard to come by, but when talent like this sits both behind and before the camera, they're a real treat for viewers who like a little challenge with their entertainment.

Additional material found only in the two disc set includes a video interview with composer Mark Mothersbaugh, a video journal by one of the interns who appear onscreen in the film, and a behind the scenes documentary which follows Wes throughout the making of the movie.  Seu Jorge is also featured in ten complete performances of Bowie songs, a reminder of how integral the songs and his renditions of them are to the mood and feel of the movie.

If you're not an obsessed fan or a movie nut who enjoys all the behind the scenes goodies, stick with the single disc, but if you like bells and whistles, this is a great set to have in your collection.",1125964800,4,1239,4.613636363636363

1525899,5,B00005JNLQ,"Spoofish Mock Documentary based on Jacques Cousteau documentaries, very dry, sarcastic yet sweet-natured.  Very original writing, very retro-schlock 70-80's coloring, set design, costume & animation. Even the documentary music has that 80's techno Kitt-the-car midi-computer music.

  Similar dryness as Waiting for Guffman, Best in Show, Royal Tenenbaums and Pecker.

  If you were wanting something easy--backoff and rent: Ghostbusters, Caddyshack, American Pie or Dukes of Hazard.

Anyway, Zissou (Murray) is a world famous naturalist filmmaker--yet oddly, he and all of his crew seem to have no credentials or interests in nature or animals.  His career is slipping, his arch-rival filmmaker Hennessey (Goldblum) is always grabbing up all the grant money & flirting with Zissou's wife, Eleanor (Houston).  Zissou needs her brains and family's money to stay in business, and she and her family have cut him off.

  His latest film bombs publicly at the screening.  He vows mortal vengeance on a never-seen-before-species of shark that killed his pal--shocking their nature-loving fans.  In the nick of time, Zissou's new-found ""son"" Ned (Wilson) shows up with a big inheritance!  Poof!  Zissou renames him ""Kingsley (Ned) Zissou"" with new stationary, & stuffs him in the team uniform of a pistol, speedo & red knit cap.  Even the Indian guy has a red-turban. Off they go in their rust-bucket of a scientific-research boat with much news video of the giant safe with Ned's Cash $$ they are taking.

  The crew is very quirky & odd. Defoe steals the show with his ultra-needy, jealous, heartbroken, wannabe ""son"".  The college geeks are carrying computers in almost every scene.  Floating around, there's the kooky Brazilian covering David Bowie songs in Portuguese, and the topless nagging girl.  The pregnant journalist (Blanchett) shows up, officially to do a nice-story on Zissou, but keeps slipping clues that it might be a brutal expose'. Ned falls for her, but is ultra-gentlemanly enough to give her space to work out her issues.  Zissou & Ned develop a rivalry for her, threatening their developing father-son relationship.

Pirates attack, looking suspiciously familiar, like the Filipino cooking staff of possibly Hennessey's boat--who were watching the news video. (Modern Pirate attacks: 360 attacks in 2002)  Zissou ""steals"" their 3-legged dog as revenge.

Zissou's crew robs Hennessey's research station and steal his equipment, mainly the espresso machine, they didn't know what the rest of it was.

  They are forced to beg for help from Eleanor & her family, interrupting her session with a 20-year-old male model.  While visiting her family estate, they find nearby the pirates & a kidnapped Hennessey & bond agent.  Zissou flips out and saves the day with a crazed, suicidal charge.

  A sad event demoralizes the crew & slaps in Zissou's face  his many spurned chances to be a father.

  Suddenly, there is that magical chance to chase and connect with the symbolic unicorn again, and all are enthralled with the magic of the experience in a way they've probably never experienced in all their decades of being fake naturalists.

The love interest played by Kate Blanchett agonizes over a previous relationship we never really learn about, maybe she's in love with the Owen Wilson character, maybe not, who cares, she doesn't seem to.  Angelica Huston mostly seems to be brooding over how she will take revenge on her agent for getting her into this turkey.  Willem Dafoe maybe reveals too much in the extra features when he mentions sitting around the set all week to deliver one line, at least he had a few good lines to deliver, few other characters were so lucky. There are whole scenes with absolutley no relationship to the rest of the film, it's almost as if scraps of film were picked up off the cutting room floor and spliced back into the movie at random, surely the deleted scenes were chosen by flipping a coin.  I suppose some folks see this ""no rules"" style as a terribly artistic rejection of convention, to me it just looks sloppy and self-indulgent.  This movie could have been so much better with just a little effort, but from the director on down it doesn't seem like anyone cared to work up a sweat.

1525962,4,B00005JNLQ,"I really enjoyed the story, characters, and humor of this film.  The humor is very offbeat, and I can understand why many people don't enjoy this film at all.  In a way, the film's humor is much like the Yankees baseball team; you either love it or hate it.  There's really not a lot of side-splitting, howling out loud type of laughs in the film.  What you do get is an ongoing queue of humorous events and characters.  I had a grin on my face throughout the entire film.

If you like Bill Murray, you'll probably like this film.  If you like Owen Wilson, I'd say your chances of liking the film are about 50-50, since this is not the typical Owen Wilson role.  Most will enjoy the other stars in the film, all of which add something to make the film unique.

There is a somewhat serious side to the film, which considers the life of a formerly successful man who has to come to terms with recent failures, direction of his remaining years, and the struggle to connect with those he loves.  The offbeat humor goes hand in hand with otherwise serious or even sad scenes.

I recommend this unusual film, but there will be a large segment of the population that will not like it.

1525967,5,B00005JNLQ,"I would argue that this movie is one of the best Wes Anderson movies I have yet seen (and I've seen all of them...Rushmore running a very, very close second).

The atmosphere of the movie is meant to be high on the cheese factor.  They used animational effects similar to what was used in the 70's, on purpose (further explained in special features).  The outfits and mechanical equipment also hinge on a neo 70's feel, with heaps of marine/aqua blues and lots and lots of dull yellow.

The movie itself seems to be a documentary filming the making of a documentary.  As with any Wes Anderson movie, the character relationships border on odd, and usually bring about hilarious circumstances or outcomes that keep you entertained throughout the whole flick.

The plot revolves around Steve Zissou (Bill Murray), who's a failing oceanographer/filmmaker at the end of his rope both professionally and socially.  Under extraordinary circumstances (the death of a close friend and the introduction of a new son)Steve Zissou peaks with his greatest, most heart felt movie yet to date (which you get a first hand look at the making of).  Owen Wilson at first annoyed me in this one, but as time passed I actually started to enjoy the naivette of his character.  Willem Dafoe also gave me the same feeling as Owen, perhaps because they both used accents that I've never seen either of them use, but they both have the ability and talent to lure you into their characters and make you believe them (after about 30 or 40 minutes into the movie I got comfortable with them).

Good movie, entertaining, funny, and will keep you watching.  you will know within the first 10-15 minutes of the movie if this is one for you or not, I guess it would be a good idea to rent it first than buy it (like I did) after you've gotten your own taste of it.",1123632000,3,1831,4.62037037037037

Well, I finally got around to renting it and it blew me away!

It was by far the funniest, weirdest, most clever film I saw

that year. Bill Murray is back in the leading man role for Wes and does awsome! It's funny that Bill made his career by taking on roles of loud, obnoxious, crazy characters and has lately become the king of dead pan comedy. Murray isn't just a funny guy anymore, he's also a really good actor! Joining Murray are Cate Blanchett, who reprises roles we've seen her in before, but holds her own nonetheless, Owen Wilson, always hilarious and Willem Dafoe, who steals the show this time around, I've never seen him funnier!

Anderson spins a tale of a reuniting father and son, a love triangle, jelousy, revenge, hijacking, kidnapping, rescuing and of couse, sea life. How he was able to weave all these genre's into one movie and get away with it is a testament to what a talented director he is.

As for the DVD, it was released by Criterion, so obviously it's going to have the best picture and sound quality money can buy.

The movie was released in two versions, a single disc, with commentary and trailers, or a two disc special addition, which is what I'm reviewing. The prices of the two versions vary from store to store, but wherever you're buying from, the two disc addition is well worth the extra few bucks. I won't go into what's in the features because it's written above in the description, but I will say they are one of the best feature packages I've ever seen on DVD!

However, the documentaries he films are not so much ""Jacques Cousteau"" as they are about his oddball findings or adventures as he goes from Point A to Point B.

In this film Zissou is coming to the end of his career and embarks on what seems to be one last hurrah of a trip. The twist here is that just before he sets sail, he meets his long-lost son (Owen Wilson) who he invites along for the ride.

Bill Murray is his usual funny self in this movie, but the plot seems to go nowhere and I found myself wishing that the story would just end. I had been hoping for more of a comedy or even a story, but for me this film was just tiresome and way too long.",1123545600,4,877,4.245508982035928

1526032,4,B00005JNLQ,"If you like a measured, dry, sarcastic, and odd comedy, you will enjoy ""The Life Aquatic.""  Bill Murray delivers a delightfully deadpan performance, as do members of an awesome supporting cast including Owen Wilson, in a major role as the possible son of the past-his-prime Jaques Cousteau knock-off Steve Zissou, played by Murray.  More subtle in their performances are Willem Dafoe, Angelica Huston, Kate Blanchett, Jeff Goldblum, and others.

Writer/Director/Producer Wes Anderson has a lot going on in the film, much concealed somehow by the seemingly slow pace, and the deadpan deliveries of the cast, who never once lapse into camp.  The pseudo-documentary sequences look delightfully phoney in every way, and the use of an obvious ship cut-away mock-up is no more explained than camera shots of the cameraman, the students from ""North Alaska University,"" or the plot migrating from Italy to Africa to the Philippines in an eyeblink.

Many crictics just didn't pick up on much of this wit, nor the name puns (calling the ship the Belafonte and the harbor Port-au-Patois for instance).  The slow pacing may make the mind wander, and then much of the nuance is lost.

For these reasons, those who enjoy the film will want to own the DVD and watch it several times to catch all that is going on.

If you are hooked on action films, special effects, or even cheap sight gags and snotty dialogue, this film isn't for you.  I haven't yet decided if it's genius or merely clever in a very, very dry way.

Judge from this and other reviews if you are the type who'd enjoy it before you order.  As several reviewers have noted, ""it isn't for everyone.""",1122940800,5,1649,4.832740213523132

1526034,4,B00005JNLQ,"Truth be told...this is NOT a film for everyone - definitely not a mainstream movie. I personally enjoy writer-director Wes Anderson's somewhat eccentric, (bizarre?), style. However, if you watched ""Rushmore"" and/or ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and did not crack a smile, or thought about turning off the DVD player, you should stop reading here. ""The Life Aquatic"" is not for you. See, how helpful I have been? Now you don't need to read the entire review.

For those of you who have chosen to remain with me, Bill Murray is at his best here - wry, witty, wacky, clever, typically dead pan, totally self-absorbed, and once in a while, comedically tragic...or morosely sentimental! Think of this as a mega-fish story, with Murray as Steve Zissou, a Jacques Cousteau kinda guy. He, just like Cousteau, is an internationally famous oceanographer, who makes underwater documentaries, and wears a Cousteau-like knitted red cap - but Steve's has a pom-pom on top of his. Unlike Cousteau, however, Steve's a pothead. The ship resembles Cousteau's famous state of the art Calypso - but here it is named the Belafonte. Get it? Belafonte used to sing calypso. Hehehe. Well, that's the kind of humor you'll find with Team Zissou. I think it's hilarious...but that's me and this is just a warning. Anyway, Captain Zissou, (whose insignia looks like the Mark of Zorro), and his crew are filming a documentary about ""The Life Aquatic."" During the film's 1st stage, Part 1, Zissou's partner and close friend Esteban, is devoured by a Great Jaguar Shark, like Jonah and the whale. However, I think the Jaguar Shark, which makes ""Jaw's"" monster Great White look like a guppy, does a bit more crunching and munching. There's blood in the water! In other words, Esteban is not swallowed whole! Steve takes an emotional turn for the worse after the death, and his Captain Ahab side emerges, as he goes in quest of vengeance, to reap havoc upon the great leviathan.

Underneath all the fame and misfortune, Steve is an insecure, middle-age man in the midst of a long-term mid-life crisis. He feels like a wash-out, his best years behind him. However, he does manage to recover enough self-esteem to hit on pregnant, unmarried journalist Jane Winslett-Richardson, (Cate Blanchett), who is writing a magazine feature about the expedition. When Steve is approached on the eve of the voyage by Ned Plimpton, (Owen Wilson), an intelligent young Southern gentleman and an airplane pilot for Kentucky Airlines, he is forced to confront his past. Ned may be his son, a love child. Zissou gives the young man a red cap and a Speedo, like the rest of the crew, and invites him to be his new assistant. He also renames him Kingsley (Ned) Zissou and buys him embossed stationery with his new moniker.

Other wild and crazy team members are the faithful, and ever so strange, German assistant Klaus, (Willem Dafoe), Jeff Goldblum as Steve's arch rival, nemesis, and much better financed competitor, Hennessey, (who wears an ""I'm A Pepper"" T-shirt), Michael Gambon is the supercilious financier Drakoulias, and Bud Cort plays the amiable, mild-mannered bond company rep, called the ""Bond Stooge,"" who fortunately happens to speak Tagalog. I say fortunately because they are boarded at one point by vicious Philippine pirates. So add some Tom Clancy action, an extreme and perverse version, along with Moby Dick, the Bill Murray/Jacques Cousteau shtick, and director Wes Anderson's shenanigans - are you getting the picture?

The Zissou crew of mongrel miscreants returns to the water once again to film Part 2. Other team members are an ex bus driver, a former substitute teacher, a topless script girl, and various summer interns who don't get paid, but do get college credits for mixing Steve's Camparis on the rocks and acting as all around gofers. Eleanor, (Anjelica Huston), is Mrs. Zissou number 2 or 3. She comes from a wealthy family, who is frequently called upon to foot the bill for the underwater ventures. Eleanor thinks she'll sit out the hunt for Moby shark. She takes off for their private island, abandoning her post as the chief logistics officer. This stresses everyone, except Mrs. Zissou. Eleanor is considered the brains behind Zissou and Co..

There are some wonderful details in the film, especially when the crew submerges in their updated WWII submarine. The fanciful, sometimes psychedelic sea creatures are created by Henry Selick. There are rhinestone bluefish, a crayoned coat of many colored seahorse, beautifully striped sugar crabs, and the most marvelous Jaguar Shark. As I mentioned, we are also treated to a pirate attack, (where Steve saves the day), a hostage rescue, (where Steve saves the day), a mutiny, (during which Steve grovels for love and sympathy), a romance, (where Steve's a loser), death and violence...none of which is to be taken seriously. Seriously. Well, maybe there are one or two solemn moments. Otherwise, ""The Life Acuatic"" is a lark. And perhaps, I'm warped.

Bill Murray does shine in this movie, and even though the character is a PITA, you like him right from the start. I had some good hearty laughs in this movie, mostly from the absurdity, but most people might not get a lot of the subtle jokes, cuz well let's face it, most people are stupid and I am most smarter.

1526102,5,B00005JNLQ,"Wes Anderson's whimsical, comedy, ""The life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" is one of those films, that your either going to absolutely love or absolutely hate. There is no middle ground in the matter. To be truthful, I tried to stay away from this movie as long as possible, due to the inordinate amount of bad reviews I had seen. I finally rented it from the local video store only because my wife practically demanded to see it. (She claims it was because she was intriged by the theatrical trailer). I finally gave up, figuring I was about to waste my evening. Well, we started to watch this thing and before you know it, I found myself totally sucked into this strange, little movie. I don't know if it was Bill Murray's comic talents, the peculiar characters or the hilariously, ironic script, but after awhile my wife and I were just laughing our a_ _'s off! For those who don't know, ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" is basically a take-off on the real life, undersea explorer, Jacques Cousteau and his educational documentries. When the film opens, Explorer, Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) has just previewed (to tepid response) his latest film, which features his best friend Estaban (Seymour Cassel) being eaten by a supposed, Jaguar Shark. Zissou is basically tired and washed up both professionally and in his personal life. He feels like life is passing him by and he's wondering, why it's taking so long. Zissou decides to secure financing and take one last shot at mounting an expedition to find the undersea beast, who ate his best friend and get revenge, by killing it! Along, with his inept crew, Zissou is joined by a young man named Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson), who may or may not his illegitamate son and a pregnant, magazine writer named Jane (Cate Blanchett), who is writing a hatchet piece. Basically, anything, that could go wrong on this expedition, does go wrong. Every decision, that Zissou makes invariably leads to horrble consequences for everyone involved. It seems like no one in this film can remain unscathed either personally or professionally by the ineptitude, that is prevalent. When Zissou finally meets up with his beastly, undersea nemesis, the film takes a surreal almost beautiful turn. Director/Writer, Wes Anderson seems to be able to create his own unique and quirky world populated by whimsical characters, who are full of surprises. I doubt you would ever meet people like this in real life, yet they endlessly keep the viewer interested. Anderson's script is quite literate and a step above the usual, 'by-the-numbers', uninspired writing that usually comes out of Hollywood. The cast in this film is superb. Bill Murray as the exasperated explorer, gives his best comically slow burn, deadpan looks yet. Cate Blanchett and Owen Wilson, also give fine comic performances. Other actors in the ensemble that really shine include Angelica Houston as Zissou's wife, Jeff Goldblum as the explorer's more successful competition, Michael Gambon as the expedition's money man and Willem Dafoe as a hilariously, jealous & needy member of the film crew. Finally, I want to mention the film's wonderful  soundtrack & score, which features both quirky electronic music as well as actor, Seu Jorge playing acoustic guitar and singing David Bowie songs in Portugeuse. It just totally goes with this movie. Some folk's get this film's off-kiltered humor, while others don't. I thought it was really funny and I hope you do to!

1526105,4,B00005JNLQ,"How is it, that Wes Anderson's films always seem to be about absolutely nothing, and yet everything that really matters, all at one time?

He does it to the extreme in the tripped out yellow submarine adventure that is The Life Aquatic. With his usual all-star cast, theatre-esque shots, trademark titles, and unique use of color this strange little film leads you around by the nose to a soundtrack of David Bowie songs performed acoustic and in Portugese by one of the characters on the sea quest.

Owen Wilson's ""accent"" was annoying as it faded in and out and he never really developed as a character. Bill Murray started off slow, but finished strong. Anjelica Huston was underused, but fabulous as always, as was Jeff Goldbulm (who, incidentally, had the perfect amount of screen time for his character). Willem Dafoe is a genius, and Cate Blanchett turned in a surprisingly good performance. The surrounding cast was great, particularly the ""interns"" who provided the only realistic moments in the film. As with all his work, be sure to watch the background for amazing incidental actions.

Anderson's retro effects- green screening, animation, and quirky special effects give Aquatic a different flavor that some may not care for, but true fans will swallow with a smile. While not his best work, its still a must-see for followers of Rushmore, Bottle Rocket, and The Royal Tennenbaums.",1121212800,,1394,5.0
1526106,4,B00005JNLQ,"The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou is the new quirky film directed by Wes Anderson and starring Bill Murray (Groundhog Day, Ghostbusters). This movie would be the duo's third time working together after Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums.

Aquatic is a story of an eccentric oceanographer named Steve Zissou who leads his unusual team of documentary film makers and crew in voyages to discover sea life. It all pays off, however, due to the fact that his documentaries are screened worldwide and he has made global fame for years.

The beginning of the movie coincides with the death of his top crew member, Esteban, at the jaws of the mysterious 'Jaguar Shark', while the rest of the film pursues Steve and company on a mission to avenge his friend's death and catch the shark. Although, the movie sounds like an action/adventure, it is that but with a modest Wes Anderson type of humor that he's known for. Murray adds his smart wit to the script as well as the remaining cast including Willem Dafoe in his funniest role to date as the sensitive Klaus Daimler and Cate Blanchett as Jane Winslett Richardson, the pregnant reporter who becomes the love interest despite her romantic affair with his newly found son Ned, or Kingsley Zissou, played by Owen Wilson.

The movie features animation of the fantasy sea animals which adds a nice touch to the overall fun that the movie offers, as well as one liners that are destined to be repeated constantly by die-hard Zissou fans.

Now go get yourself a red cap and speedo!

1526107,5,B00005JNLQ,"A lot of people had problems with this film.  They believe Wes Anderson just didn't achieve what was (or should have been) intended in this one compared to his previous projects.  I think he's gotten back to the heart that was in his first full length, Bottle Rocket.  In that one, it focused on the preoccupation of juvenile adult males, some not totally with all their marbles and none of them really much more than slackers, on having a gang/team/crew and having adventures.  In Rushmore, I think it's more along the line of someone trying to make do without a crew, but finally finding themselves in the end (amongst many other things...or maybe it's not even part of this Crew Trilogy).  In Tenenbaums, it seems like your relatives/family becoming (perhaps by default) a sort of crew, and how you deal with that.  In Aquatic, it's your crew (literally) becoming your family.  There's so much intricacy of universal human interaction, as well as the unique quirks (like the refreshing strangeness of all their honesty and emotional openness...maybe the salt air?) of the characters and their ""aquatic documentary culture"", contained in this film.  Then there's those Wes Anderson signature mid-wide angle lenses and all the dead-pan symmetry.  I noticed a great deal of fit, finish, and detail to the dialog, front and background.  There's a lot going on in this film, with believability and a sense of alternate-authenticity, in spite of this really being a parody of sorts.  Nice reveal on why they all wear glocks.

Bill Murray is hilarious as a poor man's Cousteau who seeks to destroy the sharks that ate his friend and colleague. Not only is the plot original, so is the dialogue. The humor is hidden at times but obvious if you follow the line of thought. Many of the jokes won't make a lick of sense to those who list ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" among their all-time favorites.

1526194,4,B00005JNLQ,"I think if everyone would stop referring to the Wes Anderson movies as comedies we would all be better off.  ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" is not about making the audience laugh.  Yes, there are times you will laugh, but there are also times you will cringe, and there are other moments for just about everything else.  What kind of movie is it?  It really isn't something that can be given a single label.  Yes, there are all kinds of jokes, but aren't they in the service of something more than simple laughs?  Hearing David Bowie songs in Portuguese with an acoustic guitar is not only funny, it is kind of beautiful.

A simple joke is the name of Zissou's ship.  The Belefonte is clearly a play on Cousteau's Calypso as are the crew's red knit caps.  However, some of the humor is quite tough.  Think of the scene with Jeff Goldblum's Alistair Hennessy playing cards with his pirate captors as Steve Zissou comes in the room.  What follows is funny, but grim at the same time.  Then there is the weird way the inside of the boat is portrayed in a cutaway set that looks fake and is meant to look fake.  Notice that the science room is the smallest room on this research vessel.  The Sauna is much bigger and all the rooms given over to film production constitute most of the ship.

This movie has a lot of fun with the artificial in documentaries and films.  Even the scenes of creatures of the sea are often CGI creations that don't even try to look real.  Heck, even the colors in the Zissou documentaries are supersaturated and look like they were done in different colors of ink rather than the ocean.  How real is life when you are more concerned about getting everything shot with the right sound rather than living it?  And how legitimate can a documentary be when it is cobbled together from a lot of staged shots and hosted by someone who really doesn't have a clue about the science behind what is being filmed?

All of the lead actors are terrific and Bill Murray leads the way as the weary and fading Steve Zissou.  Everyone involved with Zissou has their own downward arc.  Even the equipment is old and barely works.  Tired helicopters are dangerous things.

Does the movie work?  Maybe not.  However, I find so much to watch and enjoy in each scene - even just the actions of the non-speaking characters - that I really enjoyed this movie.  If you want to see something strangely beautiful, that plays with all kinds of notions of what is real and what is fake and has a lot of fun along the way, this might be something you would enjoy, although it is not for children.

I guess the kind of send up it is, even of Moby Dick, can be captured by then end title that expresses ""gratitude to the Jacques Cousteau Society even though they had nothing to do with the making of the film.""  I like this kind of thing.  Maybe you do to.",1120089600,233,2854,4.401529636711281
1526195,3,B00005JNLQ,"It seems like jealousy to put Wes Anderson on the rack for being too inventive with ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou."" Anderson, in a short career of ten years and four films, has used his bookish, geeky, bittersweet humor to populate worlds that, until this movie, we wouldn't mind living in, especially the New York in ""The Royal Tenenbaums,"" a New York that probably existed for about two seconds in the 1970s, on the best date you ever had, at golden, chilly autumn dusk, when all the ego and pomp of the Me Generation took a night off, and even the cruel were hilarious.

Just how Anderson orchestrated the tone of that film is a minor miracle, and he's aiming for another one in ""The Life Aquatic"" and he pretty much fails, though not completely, and not in a boring way. It'd be an insult to ""Tenenbaums"" to really assert this movie works, because it's all over the place, injecting equal parts whimsy and regret into the narrative and main character Steve Zissou, played by Bill Murray. Murray has become a distinct presence in film, a mercurial genius of sorts who left behind the antics when he played Polonius in the Ethan Hawke version of ""Hamlet"" and seems to have carried that presence of lonely wisdom ever since.

Zissou is a marine biologist/documentarian, and, judging by his latest effort played in front of a packed house in Rome, one of diminishing skills. To watch the documentary, he actually has no skills - Anderson makes no effort toward realism. But in Wes World Zissou used to be good, and having lost his friend on the previous voyage to the mysterious and giant Jaguar Shark, there is again motivation in the his life, a part two where he finds the shark, kills it and films the struggle.

Two problems emerge: Nobody wants to fund it; and his wife, the brains of the operation, wants no part of the return voyage. A third complication: A Kentucky pilot named Ned (Owen Wilson) appears in Rome claiming he *might* be Steve's son. Steve has heard of Ned - as the movie progresses we begin to learn just how long he has known about him - and he invites Ned on the voyage to find the shark. It helps that Ned has some money to fund the voyage.

What follows is a topsy-turvy, strangely beautiful journey on this ship that includes a pregnant reporter (Cate Blanchett), Filipino pirates, a rescue mission in a rundown hotel and an unexpected death. Anderson is a wonderful filmmaker, able to compose scenes with an incredible amount of visual and informational depth. He's from the Stanley Kubrick school of cinematography - the frame is filled end to end with action and intention. There are shots in ""The Life Aquatic"" that of inspire those same emotions from ""The Royal Tenenbaums.""

And yet it is boring and slow and stupid in narrative. Anderson made this movie to express his apparent love for Jacques Cousteau, but Steve is incompetent and permanently ambivalent -we struggle to *like* him as we did Gene Hackman in ""Tenenbaums."" His relationship with Ned - played by Wilson with a Kentucky-English accent, a pipe and a kind of dreamy maturity - sort of lingers about. And Blanchett, maybe for the first time in his career, is a annoyance, playing the not-really love interest. Take her out of the picture and you save a good 20 minutes, and a good 10 could have been saved on Jeff Goldblum's rival scientist. Anderson assembled an impressive cast but didn't have much to do with them.

In its own way ""The Life Aquatic"" is art, meant to do more than just entertain; filmed in Rome and on the Mediterranean Sea, individual scenes stand out as candy-colored still lifes. There are vibrant blues, stormy greens, warm, inviting sands.

1526286,3,B00005JNLQ,"Stop following the thin story of 'The Life Aquatic,' and you may enjoy the delightfully eccentric characters and its numerous homages to sea-adventure programs.  Wes Anderson gathered a unique collection of characters played by skillful actors including his regular Bill Murray, but mostly the film represents Anderson's love for old-fashioned shows like Jacques Cousteau.  I am a film fan who prefers good story to good characters, and that's the only reason for my lower rating.

But there is a story, mainly surrounding Bill Murray's Steve Zissou, whose latest adventure film has just bombed -- even though his best friend was eaten by a big shark.  And that shark happens to be an endangered species, against which Steve publicly declares war, or revenge.  This silly story is quite funny when it is supported by Bill Murray's tired 'what-I-am-doing-now' face.

Financial troubles are settled when a young American 'Ned' (Owen Wilson) shows up before him, claiming that he is Steve's son.  Investing the money he inheritated, 'Ned' joins in the expedition team of Steve Zissou, and we are going to meet strange but amusing persons on board the ship 'Bellafonte' (meaning Harry?).

The most impressive is the names of the actors -- in addition to excellent Bill Murray, you can see Owen Wilson, CAte Blanchett, Anjelica Huston, Willem Defoe, Jeff Goldblum, Michael Gambon, Bud Cort, Noah Taylor, and famous singer Sue Jorge (whose unique version of one British singer should not be missed).  And Steve Zissou's poor friend (eaten by a shark) is  Seymour Cassel.

As I said, the superb production designs (of the ship, mainly) and off-beat characters are the merit of the film.  It is also greatly helped by the candy-color creatures in the sea, animated by Henry Selick (director of 'The Nightmare Before Christmas').  At the same time, however, the film often loses its course, among the unnecessary (so I thought) episodes about the pirates (yes, they attack!), and many homages to other works, mainly documentaries, are too much to me.

As to Wes Anderson, I still believe 'Rushmore' is his best, and I remember the great acting from Bill Murray in that funny little film.  Compared with that, 'The Life Aquatic' has more budget and more actors, but to me at least, a less interesting story.  But Bill Murray is still terrific, and the ending is very touching.",1119744000,2,2366,5.028205128205128

I found myself waiting for the cleverness and coherence of the story to develop; at the end, I was still waiting.  It certainly is not for lack of trying on the part of the generally lovable cast, but there just isn't much here to tickle the imagination or funnybone.  The screenplay resorts to crude language for humor, which can work at times, but not even Bill Murray can breathe much life into this soporific stinker.

But I'll cite one exception that made me laugh out loud: When Zissou, the professional naturalist, sensitive to all creatures great and small, is asked what kind of cat his dead cat was, his reply, in inimitable Bill Murray fashion is: ""Who gives a s--t.""

If you think a work is not interesting, engaging, or humorous, and you find many others also think it is not interesting, engaging, or humorous, then you may rely that there will be those who claim it is ""Zen,"" or art, or in some other way unaccesible to philistines like you, but special only to the rarified few who can really appreciate such depth.

I would say the tone and humor compares more to Rushmore than to Royal Tenebaums. In fact, Zissou and Rushmore's main character Max Fischer have lots of similarities. All of Anderson's trademark style is present here: Background/set humor, great music, and terrific dialogue. With all of this going on, it's Bill Murray who really excels here. His dry, sarcastic wit fits perfectly with Anderson's style (and is probably why he's been in three of his four movies), and now playing a main character (he had smaller roles in the other two Anderson movies) he is able to deliver the goods in spades. Cate Blanchett and Owen Wilson do marvelously, although I was disappointed in Willem Dafoe's performance. Overall, a joy to watch and a movie I will own. I generally don't like to compare movies by the same director, but whether or not you liked Rushmore is probably a good litmus test to whether or not you will like The Life Aquatic.

1526291,5,B00005JNLQ,"I love this movie to no end. My friend put it well by saying, ""It's so quirky and sarcastic, but somehow warms your heart.""

The synopsis is that Zissou (Murray) is a washed up documentary film star. He seems to inspire the crew around around him, but also carries a plethora of faults. Namely, he's selfish and Eleanor (Angelica Houston looking devine) usually upfronts most of the cash and brains for his documentaries. After an enigmatic jaguar shark eats his best friend and mentor, he sets out to find the shark and kill it for revenge. During a stay onshore he also meets Owen Wilson (Ned) who is a long lost son from a former fling.

Ned agrees to join Team Zissou (red cap and speedo have been ordered accordingly) and from here we begin to see Zissou's more human moments. Perhaps its also the breakdown of his bubble because he no longer has full reign over the ship. Cate Blanchett also arrives on the ship as a journalist who is writing a piece on Zissou and confronts him about some of his more poor qualities via her journalist interviewing.

The synopsis provides an age old story of old genuis who basically has his mid-life crisis. But what makes Life Aquatic fantastic is the journey itself. Each character is in full swing of quirks. For example, a deckhand Seu Jorge, singing David Bowie songs in Portuguese provides background music and visuals. Also Klaus (William Defoe), vying to be Zissou's favourite in only the way a jealous German step child could be. The film also have scenes in Italy and will make you want to visit the opulence.

In between the antics though, a humanity strings the characters together and warms your heart. Its a wonderful film that suspends the imagination for an adult in this dreamy pseudo-Disney world. My favourite are the digital sea animals (crayon sea horses, angels fish, sawfish and the jaguar shark). The music is fanstic too with Brasilian Seu Jorge singing David Bowie, kitschy techno tunes, and an Icelandic appearance from Aegtis Bryun.

Not everyone will like it. The humour is very dead pan, subtle, and sarcastic. Also, the quirks of the characters are exaggerated and some may find it strange. Like I say, its sort of a Disney film for adults as its so dreamy and colorful.

If you like films like Royal Tenebaums, Clerks, Best in Show, its thats sort of humor...Happy viewing.",1119139200,6,2346,4.723716381418093

1526362,5,B00005JNLQ,"I can understand why people dislike this movie. The jokes are not in your face, laugh out loud gut busters. The characters are one-dimensional. The ""special effects"" are cheesy. The plot situations are contrived and artificial. If you're looking for conventional filmmaking, don't bother with this film.

I love this movie. It's what I call a ""Zen movie"" meaning that to enjoy it, you should simply sit back and let yourself be drawn into the film. Don't think about or analyze what you're seeing. Just let it happen. It all makes sense in its own way, in its own context.

Bill Murray is brilliant in his portrayal of someone who is old enough to recognize and accept his shortcomings and those of everyone around him. He realizes that he can't change and he can't change his wife or companions, so he has to find a way to make do with what he is and what they are. Ned's (Owen Wilson arrival presents an opportunity for change and Zissou tries, but in the end he knows its useless. Instead, Zissou embraces the flaws and quirks of ""Team Zissou"" and accepts that they are bound together like a very tight knit family.

They are what they are and they accept it.

The pursuit of the shark allows Zissou to discover that he is not crazy, that for all of his failings and his diminished stature in the public eye he still is capable of being right and that he has value as an individual. He's not just a washed up middle-aged has-been with a failed marriage and a drinking habit. He is a human being, flawed but decent. He represents the imperfect reality of life rather than an idealized and fictitious version of what a man is supposed to be.

All of this plays out in a fanciful world where conventional reality is unimportant. It doesn't matter that the undersea shots are cheesy or that the motivations of all of the characters are not fully understood. All of this serves as a blank canvas or scaffolding to support the immediate present of the movie. The past and future don't matter.

Live in the moment of the film and you will enjoy it.",1118793600,5,2044,4.510810810810811
1526363,3,B00005JNLQ,"It begins and ends with the deaths of key persons in the life of oceanographer Steve Zissou, a sort of underfunded Jacques Cousteau. His career needs the boost it gets when a young man who actually is his son joins a voyage of vengeance (think ""Jaws"" or ""Moby Dick""). They set out to kill the shark that ate his partner at the beginning. Father and son fall for an unmarried pregnant reporter also on board (don't ask). There is a shipboard kidnapping and deadly shoot-outs on board and on a deserted island. This is a comedy. No kidding.

Yes, we are sailing in waters in which the imaginative director. Wes Anderson, has charted a course badly in need of a compass. It is the weakest of his films (""Rushmore,"" ""Boogie Nights,"" ""Magnolia"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums."") In it we await the moment when all the entertaining bits and pieces come together in a satisfying way, only to have it end before that moment arrives. That we are willing to stay with it testifies to the sly charm of those bits and pieces and Anderson's skill with them.

In the title role, the reliable Bill Murray tries so hard to appear not to be acting that he actually doesn't. That leaves a hole in the movie that the other actors, most of whom like Murray have worked with Anderson before, are unable to fill. Cate Blanchett, Owen Wilson, Angelica Huston, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Michael Gambon, Bud Cort, how can you go wrong with a cast like that? Apparently, you can. Even when your movie is given a two-disc DVD transfer by the standard-setting Criterion Collection.

""The Life Acquatic With Steve Zissou"" boasts a city block-long cutaway of the ship ""Belafonte"" (a wink at Cousteau's ship ""Calypso."") There is some clever animation, and original songs by David Bowie are sung in Portugese throughout. But these flourishes are not enough to invigorate the humor or quicken the pace. Anderson is a true auteur, a treasure really, who writes and directs his own ideas instead of adapting other work to the screen. Given his excellent track record, we can cut him some slack on this one.",1118620800,2,2069,4.694214876033058

In the pursuit of an elusive dream, he as managed to incure monumental debt, alienate those who love him -- including at least two wives and his would-be son -- and still he remain charming and emotionally vulnerable.  Many mainstream critics have  panned the film for being too quirky, uneven or whimsical to a fault. Not so at all.  It is fanciful, yes, but much like the Royal Tenenbaums, creates a surreal world closely approximating the real one, where he can intelligently explore the emotional make up of a charismatic figure and the cadre of followers that are drawn to him, in a sensitive and deeply insightful way.  Anderson tackles these issues in a manner reminiscent of Kubrick, willing to abandon convention and drill down to the essence of our emotional being.  This is a classic film and a must-have!",1118448000,6,954,4.822085889570552
1526365,5,B00005JNLQ,"Another impressive achievement here from Wes Anderson, who has to be one of the top three directors working today.  As in all of his films, many forgotten cultural icons are put on display such as the red caps and speedos of Cousteau along with a ship named ""The Belafonte.""  With actors, he always goes back to the deepest well, so to speak, and Bill Murray once again excels in a title role.  Murray has proved repeatedly that he has range far beyond that of a comedic actor. Here, he is a pleasure to have on screen.

The diver Steve Zissou is a beaten, drunken, washed-up Cousteau clone coming out for one shadily financed final adventure--ostensibly to revenge the death of his old first mate, Esteban, at the hands of a Jaguar shark.  His possible son, Ned or Kingsley (Owen Wilson), then arrives and this becomes a far more interesting subplot than the chase for the shark; except for the fact that Wilson's Kentucky accent is just terrible.  The same can be said of the pirate sequences which are a lot of fun as Zissou takes on an Eastwood role.  Actually, you would not expect such things to occur nowadays and the attack on the pirate hideaway may have been my favorite scene.

There are a good many notable co-stars standing out in The Life Aquatic.  Particularly fine is the performance by Willem Dafoe as Zissou's lackey and, sometime only supporter, Klaus.  Goldblum is great too as the foil and competitor diver.

We are given unending twists in the plot, and, although it starts slowly, the story satifies by the end.  Yet plot never has had much to do with Wes Anderson's success.  His talent and gifts all lie in characterization.  How he achieves such development in a small timeframe is amazing.  In nearly every film we care about the individuals on screen as all of them have some aspect we find interesting, even if it's only in the Portuguese singing of cover songs.  We identify with them and feel resignation when our time with them ends.  This effort is no different from his earlier ones in this regard.  Although, not The Royal Tenenbaums, it's as good as Rushmore and Bottle Rocket, and certainly as strong as anything anybody else is putting out today.",1118448000,2,2184,4.657963446475196

I think it is the best Wes Anderson movie so far. All the performances are terrific and I honestly can't think of one thing I don't like about this movie. It is a masterpiece in my opinion. The characters are all endearing and the script and every scene is dripping with originality. I found the interview scene with the killer whale in the background hilarious. It made me laugh each time I watched it. Cate Blanchett was adorable. I have never liked Bill Murray so much as I liked him in this film. And to top it off, the movie also has one of my favorite actors, Jeff Goldblum, who also turns in a good performance.

I really don't understand people who didn't like this movie or didn't think it was Wes Anderson's best ever... Uneven? Pretentious? What are they talking about?? I just don't understand the criticism of this film. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. I am glad I bought the special edition version of the dvd and I highly recommend this movie.

I think it is this that has buoyed this particular movie's status.  Wes Anderson's LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU has so many misfires it's a wonder it ever sailed at all.  While the script has some clever lines and it's premise is somewhat intriguing, the execution of the film is so lame I found myself wondering when it would end.  Bill Murray as Steve Zissou gives one of those patented Murray performances, trying hard to be taken seriously as an actor, yet maintaining some of the persona that made him famous in the first place.  Murray doesn't seem all that inspired in his performance, and even in some of his better scenes with Owen Wilson and Anjelica Huston, they aren't enough to salvage his performance.  Wilson and Huston on the other hand make the best of their material and are actually effective in the roles of Murray's supposed son and his business savvy wife.  Willem Dafoe has one of his strangest roles as Murray's long suffering mate; Jeff Goldblum is erratic as Murray's oceanographic rival; Cate Blanchett being the marvelous actress she is even makes the pregnant journalist convincing.  The attempt to Portuguesize David Bowie's music is commendable, but I found most of the music intrusive and unimportant.  Director Anderson and his film crew do serve up some beautiful underworld fantasy images and the arrival of the Jaguar Shark is certainly photogenic.  But the movie seems little more than an exercise in technical wizardry and I never felt myself sympathizing with any of them.",1118188800,9,1641,4.930909090909091

If you are looking for overt laughs a minute, it might not be for you, but it does satisfy in a different manner. The humor is subtle and intelligent.  The movie has a warm ambience and displays a comic surealism on so many different levels, from the techno soundtrack to subtle little activities, like the three legged dog ""cody"", to the laughable animated sea creatures. Bill Murray delivers a warm and finely tuned performance that is believable and he makes the part work well. William Defoe is hilarious as a neurotic crew member. The cast is a joy to watch and there is a chemistry in their combined performance.

Looks like I'm going to have to get honest on you people. I love film more than anyting. If I had the chance to make one, I'd do it in a second flat! I am fully aware of Wes Anderson's career, going back to ""Bottle Rocket"", ""Rushmore"", and ""The Royal Tenenbaums"". Now, with ""The Life Aquatic"", I can safely say that Anderson's best film by far is still ""Rushmore"". Why? It's a simple coming of age story. Ever since ""The Royal Tenenbaums"", it seems that what concerns Anderson is to make films for himself.

I was eager to see this film for the simple fact that, yeah, he does make pretty off the wall films. When I did though, I wished to my God, he didn't. This movie is so bad, it left me with a rotten taste in my mouth. It's niether funny, dramatic, nor suspenseful. It's looks as though all of Anderson's jokes are inside or simply for him. The best it got out of me was mere chuckle and it wasn't because a joke was done. Ugh! Seriously, the only thing worth admiring here is how it is shot and the music but looking or sounding good shouldn't justify you to like it. It really seems that Anderson is trying way too hard to be unique and stylish. If you watch it, fine. Just don't feel like you have to love it in order to be cool. This film is so NOT cool, NOT at all. It's boring, not funny, silly, and pretenious! One other thing, is Anderson a homophob? There are a lot of references in the film that poke fun at that community. Words like: bull dike and fag are used to get laughs out of the audience. Wow, that's low.

P.S. What is with the Criterion Collection automatically submiting Wes Anderson's films? The only one that deserves it is ""Rushmore"" and that took a while for it to get on. Then again, ""Armageddon"" was chosen too. So now you can see that the Criterion Collection's standards are pretty low.",1117929600,4,1942,4.373961218836565
1526450,4,B00005JNLQ,"I wasn't a great fan of Wes Anderson's THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS, believing that the potentially touching story Anderson tried to tell with his kooky cast of characters was often submerged under a lot of precious, self-consciously offbeat style. And yet, after seeing his latest film THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU, I just might be compelled to give TENENBAUMS another chance one day.

I should have perhaps realized it with RUSHMORE, but I think watching THE LIFE AQUATIC helped me understand why Anderson has the following that he does: it must be a sense of childlike innocence and wonder that Anderson fans are responding to. The man, it seems to me, doesn't have a cynical bone in his body. There is a generous heart to his sensibility that must charm a lot of people, and while I thought his rather forced whimsical touches somewhat obscured that heart in THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS, somehow Anderson's typically offbeat touches---the introduction of pirates into the plot, the Greek chorus of one Seu Jorge singing David Bowie songs in Portuguese---only seems to enhance the delight of Anderson's child-like yet singularly deep and humane vision.

Anderson is also lucky to have Bill Murray on top form in this film, playing a man-child who dislikes adult responsibilities but, in this film's version of a midlife crisis, realizes he eventually has to take them on anyway...especially when a young man named Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson) appears on the scene and says that he is Zissou's son. It's a wonderfully-written role with quite a bit of emotional and dramatic complexity, and Murray is vivid and genuinely touching in his interpretation of Zissou as a man who, as his creative juices start to dry, is starting to take stock in his life and reflect on what his legacy could be.

Murray's role, though, is admittedly the only character with any real depth...not necessarily a problem, I suppose, since Zissou and his external and internal conflicts are what the movie is about. The only real problem with this movie is its plotting: instead of focusing itself solely on Zissou and his search for the ""jaguar shark"" that killed a best friend of his, Anderson and co-writer Noah Baumbach find it cool to introduce detours like pirates into the mix. Such detours threaten to blunt the emotional impact that these characters are meant to have.

That THE LIFE AQUATIC emerges from its rambling plot smelling like roses is perhaps a tribute to not only how good Bill Murray is in this film, but perhaps also how visually beautiful it is. Anderson has a way of framing and setting up his shots so that they look obviously composed rather than spontaneously achieved. In RUSHMORE, the feeling engendered by his singular style was surprisingly claustrophobic (surprising for a 2.35:1 film), and in THE ROYAL TENANBAUMS, I thought it was a little distracting. But cinema is a visual medium, above all, and why should we be so harsh to a director who fixates as much as Anderson does on visual framing and set design? Especially if the results are as lovely as they sometimes are in this film? There are some wondrous shots here, particularly when Anderson shoots some of the animated sea creatures created for the film by Henry Selick. They looked so good on my TV that it made me wish that I had seen this movie in a theater, where the much-larger dimensions---combined with Anderson's usual widescreen format---might have made for an even more enveloping experience.

THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU surprised me. After being less than overwhelmed by THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS, I expected this movie to be more of the same. In some ways, it is; Anderson is still occasionally trying to let us know just how damn creative he is (haha, David Bowie songs sung in Portuguese, haha). But I responded to Anderson's humane vision and to his whimsical touches more positively here. It may not be a masterpiece, but I will grant Anderson this: here is a director with a refreshing lack of cynicism, and with a concern for characters that ought to be cherished these days. Certainly, the movie has made me perhaps re-assess some of my views of Wes Anderson. Recommended.",1117670400,,4153,4.885106382978724

1526453,4,B00005JNLQ,"Wes Anderson has continually shown that he has the uncanny ability to assemble his own microcosmic worlds within his movies and THE LIFE AQUATIC is no exception.  In this film, we see his latest new universe full of exotic fish, idiosyncratic characters, and sea pirates that showcases even more whimsy than the filmscapes he conjured up in RUSHMORE and THE ROYAL TENNEBAUMS.  At the helm of it all is Captain Steve Zissou, played in all his freewheeling glory by Bill Murray.  Again, the male figurehead is portrayed in the typical crass, macho-man variety common to Anderson's films, with the usual undercurrent of doubt, regret, and self-loathing flowing swiftly beneath.  Of course, this doesn't mean there's no laughs to come from the dull-sounding framework.  With a strong ensemble cast including Owen Wilson, Willem Dafoe, Cate Blanchett, Angelica Houston, and Jeff Goldbloom the film travels through many misadventures from trespassing and theft of sea equipment to an impromptu gunfight at an abandoned luxury island hotel.  And lets not forget the three-legged dog and, in what might be the movie's finest touch, the Portugese troubadour from Team Zissou who serenades us with 70's era David Bowie tunes.

The movie is beautiful in presentation with purposefully cheesy special effects, that although lame, lend the movie a sentimental fantasy movie quality.  Some of the sea-life, especially the infamous ""jaguar shark"" tend to look like something out of a Tim Burton film.  Unfortunately, things settle to a grind for the closing half-hour and the characters in this film seem less vulnerable and not nearly as emotionally rich as those from past Anderson flicks.  Murray's Zissou never really reveals that soft underbelly and Owen Wilson's Kingsley Ned Zissou never quite materializes into anything significant or compelling.  All this being said, it's still a pleasing film, loaded with goodies that are sure to multiply with repeat viewings.  If you've never been keen on Anderson's films this one's certainly not going to convert you.  Yet, if you like to step foot into zany new world's full of kooky characters and grand, visionary cinema, hop aboard THE LIFE AQUATIC.",1117584000,,2187,5.232091690544412
1526454,4,B00005JNLQ,"Saying that a movie starring Bill Murray is strange hardly seems a revelation, but ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" is certainly out there in its own little universe.  The obvious cinematic reference point for this 2004 film is 2001's ""The Royal Tenenbaums,"" since Wes Anderson directed both of them, but this quirky film has a better payoff, although I would be hard pressed to argue out exactly how that is accomplished.  Murray is the hook to get people to see this movie, but the rest of the fishing paraphernalia belongs to Anderson.

Steve Zissou (Murray) is either a parody of, or a homage to deep sea explorer Jacques Cousteau (it works either way but I lean towards the latter interpretation).  Zissou has been making documentaries for decades, but now his star is in decline and to add insult to injury, his best friend is devoured by a ""Jaguar Shark.""  This turns Zissou into Captain Ahab but before he can set sail on the good ship ""Belafonte"" (famous for his calypso singing, which, it turns out, was the name of Cousteau's own good ship), a couple of newcomers show up for the ride.  Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson), appears to be the son that Zissou never knew he had, and Jane Winslett-Richardson (Cate Blanchett) is a journalist who is doing an article on Zissou and his quest.  Zissou is smitten with Jane, who takes a fancy to Ned.  Meanwhile Zissou's estranged wife, Eleanor (Angelica Huston), continues to be the brains behind Team Zissou, Klaus (Willem Dafoe) remains Zissou's right-hand man, Bill (Bud Cort) is along to count the money, and even rival Alistair Hennessey (Jeff Goldblum) lends assistance, even if he does not know about it until it is too late to say ""no.""

Henry Selick (""The Nightmare Before Christmas"") does the animation for all of the underwater sea life in glowing pastel colors, and that aspect of the film helps to clue us into the wry surrealism of its humor.  The other big clue is that one of the crewmembers sings David Bowie songs in Portuguese.  Oh, and then there is the fact that the there are scenes taking place on a cutaway version of the ""Belafonte"" that would also be a clue. The problem is that there are patches where you think we are supposed to be taking things more seriously than we are, especially when the title character emerges from his lethargy to try and do something about all the down spiraling in his life.  Still, despite the steady sense of unease that afflicted me through most of the movie, I liked the ending of ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou,"" both in terms of the underwater climax and the on shore resolution.

It's like someone set out to make a serious movie about an egomaniacal Jacques Cousteau clone and his failed relationships, but decided it was too much work to get any actual emotional involvement or actual oceanography in it, so gave it just enough silliness and action and special effects to keep it from being taken seriously, but not enough humor to qualify it as a comedy and not enough action to make it an action movie and not enough special effects to make it a special-effects movie.

If you're looking for a special-effects laden undersea adventure...this isn't it. (Hardly any time is spent underwater, and the animated creatures are mere window dressing.)

If you're looking for an offbeat comedy with an original setting...this isn't it. (Though it does have a few good lines and some promising elements that MIGHT have been funny if they had been played up more.)

If you're looking for a serious film about human relationships with depth and feeling, this isn't it. (The relationships are there, and plenty of screen time is spent revealing them and dissecting them, but it's more tedious than touching.)

If you're looking for a rather smug, self-involved film with pretensions to artistic value, this MIGHT be it...though I really couldn't respect a movie's artistic vision when they have two confusingly pointless topless scenes which seem only to have been put in to get an R rating.

I loved Anderson for Rushmore. The Royal Tennenbaums was a pleasant diversion with a wonderful performance from Gene Hackman. In the space of four films, however, he has already begun to immitate himself and the immitation doesn't measure up to his obvious hero Hal Ashby.

I'm an optimist. I think maybe the loss of Owen Wilson as a writing partner and the poor choice of Noah Baumbach as a replacement was perhaps the culprit in this failed effort. Hopefully he will learn from his mistakes by his next film.",1117324800,11,802,4.804347826086956

Rushmore was decent, but nothing I found exceptional. But with the release of The Life Aquatic, Wes Anderson has concocted a film that is both visually and stylistically appealing, and is filled with memorable and interesting characters surrounded by a sea faring revenge documentary adventure. And it's actually funny.
What really drove this movie was Bill Murray's performance as the insincere famous oceanographer/filmmaker Steve Zissou. This kind of character is so Bill Murray's style and it's hard to picture anyone else playing Steve Zissou, it almost makes you wonder if Wes Anderson had Bill Murray in mind for the character when writing the story.
And not just Bill Murray, but Owen Wilson, Jeff Goldblum, Cate Blanchett and Angelica Houston all perform nicely. Even Willem Dafoe's small part is done very well, and quite hilariously I might add.
Besides the acting, I really liked the overall story line that never lacked in having a hilarious sense of adventure and danger as Steve Zissou's crew goes an on a crazy and irrational sea quest to document Zissou's revenge on the infamous Jaguar Shark that supposedly ate his best friend Esteben. More importantly, its actually about Steve's relations with Ned, a man that's probably his son that he never knew.
So where The Royal Tenebaums failed at producing interesting characters and story line, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is completely the opposite and it's without that ""I'm-sorry-if-you-can't-follow-my-artsy-sophisticated-style"" feel to it, thank God.",1117238400,2,1787,5.4548736462093865

1526578,5,B00005JNLQ,"I loved this film from start to finish and it only got better the second and third times I watched it. There is a very nice feel to it: mellow, easy and cool, even when the action is on. This feel is perhaps captured best in the remarkably enjoyable Brazilian covers of classic David Bowie songs.

One thing worth noting about this film, beyond the ""quirky"" stylings that you expect from Wes Anderson (and that don't always come off, to my mind, as I just couldn't get in to The Royal Tenenbaums much as I wanted), is the way the film plays with and responds to the popularity of the ""nature documentary,"" especially those of Jacques Cousteau. In the nature documentary, we feel as though we are getting ""closer"" to nature. We believe that we are getting at something real. What we tend to forget or be unaware of, is how much mediation is involved in the presentation of nature. The nature we see on film is never nature ""as it is"" but nature as it has been framed and captured in accordance with certain expectations of what will sell, what values will play to a wide audience.

It should also be remembered that this is a Disney film, and Wes Anderson appears to be very self-conscious of the fact that a large part of Disney's name and popularity was established through Disney wildlife films. Walt Disney himself once remarked that he saw his live action wildlife films to be merely an extension of his animations -- because he knew how much the editor and filmmaker are involved in showing what you want to show. What they did show was not Darwin's ""nature red tooth and claw"" but a sanitized nature, where danger was always contained, and family values were reinforced by the behaviors of animals: a mother and her pups, for example.

That, it seems to me, helps explain the fact that Wes Anderson chose not to employ ""real"" underwater animals but chose stop motion animation as his medium. It reminds us that nature appears on screen always mediated, through a ""nature hero"" (as Zissou once was) and through a set of decisions about what to include, how to edit it, what to value.

Anyhow, I could go on and on about what I liked and thought about this film, but I can say that I didn't expect to like this film but found myself surprised feeling very nice (and a bit odd, not sure what to think) about half way through and leaving with a smile and a hint of sadness as I walked the theater. Any film that can do that to someone as jaded as I am has something going for it.",1117152000,,2481,4.434210526315789

I thought the take off on the Jacques Cousteau TV specials was spot on and truly humorous. I did not laugh out loud all the way through this film mind you, it is chock full of dull stretches and things that just make you want to scratch your head in puzzlement. I do that all the time with Wes Anderson movies, so I guess this one should be no surprise. I found this film to be clever, smart, profoundly silly, and usually just plain fun. The views of the fanciful sea critters encountered by the crew were very well done and showed a great deal of imagination and wonder at work. The fellow who kept popping up singing David Bowie songs in Portuguese somehow stole my soul and I couldn't get the sounds out of my head. Lovely idea squeezed into a wonderfully odd little film.

First, Willem Dafoe - My image of Dafoe is from 'Wild at Heart'and 'White Sands' - Evil and other-worldly far outside my paradigm.  To see him play Klause the sissified German was side splitting.  I had never seen him play comedy.

Anjelica Hustan - I love this handsome, sophisticated woman.  Most remembered by me for 'The Grifters'.  Never seen her do comedy.  Dead-pan hilarious and cool.

Michael Gambon - 'The Singing Detective'.  His acting here is just as spot on for those with eyes to see it.  Highly watchable.

This was my first Wes Anderson movie.  The wit is dry, adult, and somewhat surrealistic - like dark humor without being dark. From the reviews I have read you either love him or hate him.  If your in the former catagory then tell your friends and spread the word - this type of movie is all too rare.",1116806400,9,1010,4.437158469945355

1526584,5,B00005JNLQ,"Just some random thoughts about this movie....

A subtle, often quiet, sometimes slow, sometimes dry comedy except that it's not really a comedy. More of an ode to life.

This is a very unusual movie. If you go into it thinking that it will be like anything else you have ever seen you are already setting yourself up for disappointment. It is in a category of its own. It was promoted as a comedy but it really isn't. It's a sarcastic and sometimes sad look at life with moments of humor.

Bill Murray is suburb (when is he not?). I can't think of any other actor who could have played his role.

If you don't enjoy the first 10 minutes of this movie you will not enjoy the movie. Don't waste any more of your time.

If you are not bright there is no way you will understand or enjoy this movie. This movie is not for kids or those who think like them. In fact if you're under 30 you may get some of the humor but you probably won't ""get"" the movie. This movie is basically about life, and if you're under 30 there is little chance that you are going to understand that simple fact.

If you love NASCAR you may not like this movie.",1116633600,14,1132,4.169724770642202
1526585,4,B00005JNLQ,"Has the general movie-going public lost all sense of the subtle?!!

Do you all live and die by the mighty swish of the Light saber and the whims of the Sith?

This movie pays homage to the ridiculous 'horror' movies of the 60s as well as the idiocy that were the 'Nature Docu-Dramas' of Jacques Yves Cousteau.  If you haven't experienced either or if you can't sit through a movie in which the explosions don't actually rip the skin off your face, then you won't dig this.

The movie has intricately recreated, 'bad' special effects to add to the surreal-ness of the whole experience.  It's not intended to be 'realistic.' C'mon people, work with me here!  Restore some of the faith I had in the idea that society was comprised mostly of intelligent, free-thinking individuals with an attention span somewhat longer than you're average car chase in Too-Fast, Too-Furious.

The dialogue is somewhat skewed as well, wich adds to the over-all feel of the movie.

The movie has a carefully constructed 'unpolished' feel to it that suspends belief quite nicely, never letting you fall back into your seat.

It's one of Bill Murrey's best and he deserved an Oscar nod for this much more than for 'Sleepless in Tokyo' or whatever it was called (Lost in Translation).

1526586,4,B00005JNLQ,"Wes Anderson isn't for everyone.  He's kind of like Christopher Guest (""Waiting for Guffman"", ""Best in Show""), where the viewer really has to ""get"" the joke.  The difference is, even when you do ""get the joke"" with Anderson, you still may not be belly laughing.

Unlike Guest, Anderson isn't throwing out a bunch of one liners that you have to catch; but like Guest, you have to pay attention.  In ""Life Aquatic"", Anderson creates an incredibly complex world that is slightly off from reality.  I don't think I laughed out loud once during the entire movie, yet I was smiling and chuckling to myself the entire time.  I thoroughly enjoyed the film, and can't wait to watch it again.

""The Life Aquatic"" is basically about a once respected underwater nature documentarian, Steve Zissou (Bill Murray), who is feeling his age and lack of relevance.  He tries to revitalize himself by trying gain a connection a young man (Owen Wilson) who may, or may not, be his son.

There are so many things that I love about this film.  The cast is impeccable.  Bill Murray and Angelica Huston are amazing.  Owen Wilson, for once, didn't annoy me.  Willem Dafoe practically steals the show in a wonderfully uncharacteristic performance.

Really, the thing I love about this movie is that atmosphere.  It is on the verge of being a drama, and yet it's so silly.  There is a wonderful soundtrack of David Bowie sung in Portuguese by a Brazilian troubadour, played by Seu Jorge.  He is ubiquitous through the film, and is making subtle comments on the scenes, like a Greek chorus.  Jorge is backed up by a wonderful score written by Devo's Mark Mothersbaugh.  Other great additions to the film are the bizarre stop motion underwater creatures created by Henry Selick, the director of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"".  The stop motion looked so unique, that I thought it was computer graphics!  The sets are incredibly detailed, and scenery (filmed mostly in Rome and Naples) is simply amazing.

If you like Anderson or movies by Christopher Guest, I think you'd really enjoy this film.  If you like intelligent, quirky, off the wall films, this is definitely for you.  I know I'll be watching this many times.",1116460800,9,2191,4.8123324396782845
1526587,3,B00005JNLQ,"Perhaps the script for this film got caught in a windstorm, and they never got the pages in order, because that is how this nearly two hours of aimless filmmaking feels; the dialogue is disjointed, and the fine cast just can't pull it together to make much sense of it.
The film suffers from the same repetitive quality and air of pretentiousness that gets the best of Werner Hertzog's 2004 ""documentary"" about the Loch Ness Monster, ""Incident at Loch Ness"", which has a clever concept, but one that soon wears thin. ""The Life Aquatic"" is also a fake documentary, and the premise is that oceanographer Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) hunts for the mythical Jaguar Shark that ate his friend Esteban (Seymour Cassel). There are many similarities between these two films, so if you enjoyed the Hertzog film, you will like this, and vice versa.

Along with Murray and Cassell, the film boasts a cast of many well known actors, including Owen Wilson who plays Murray's presumed son, Cate Blanchett as a reporter, Angelica Huston as Murray's wife, as well as Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Michael Gambon, and Bud Cort.
The talent that shines the brightest is singer/guitarist Seu Jorge, whose material is excellent (including some David Bowie songs translated into Portuguese), and vocal style wonderful.
Writer/director Wes Anderson missed some opportunities here; a more cohesive script and editing would have made this film a far more entertaining adventure, and also greater use of the marvelous stop motion animated effects of marine life, which are a delight, but are few and far between.

Come on, you know your film is in trouble when a scene is so boring, you have to stick animals doing stupid things in the background to distract the audience from the pointless dialogue.

*Great cast of supporting characters, especially Klaus, the poor nameless interns, the bond company stooge. In fact, I would have enjoyed this movie more if they'd had more screen time and Bill Murray less. I love Bill Murray but his character just wasn't all that likeable - not someone I'd invite over for dinner - and I found the other characters so much more sympathetic.

*There were a lot of unexpected funny bits like hiring Ned and making a priority of getting him company stationery. Or, the part where Klaus wants to be on the ""A"" team. In the end, when they all pile into the submersible, which has a plaque saying ""maximum capacity: six"" or somthing like that. Definitely my kind of humor!

*I must be really unsofisticated because I do not get the ending at all ""in 11 years he'll be 12"" or whatever that was and who was the boy at the end? Does Cate Blanchett's character keep the baby? This was all a big ""huh"" for me, as was the death of Ned.

Once you get settled into the vibe more comfortably, there's a ton of gags that might've slipped by the radar upon first viewing. Bill Murray turns in an excellent performance, and without him we probably wouldn't be discussing this movie. William DaFoe & Anjelica Huston give the most with what screen time they had, but it's clearly Murray's show.

This film is a piece with his pervious works, ""Bottle Rocket"", ""Rushmore"" and ""The Royal Tenenebaums"".  This film contains a highly imaginative visual style.  There are any number of throwaway gags, both verbal and visual that'll leave you in tears.  Bill Murray solidly anchors this film as Captain Zissou and is ably abetted by a strong supporting cast(Owen Wilson, Willem Dafoe, Angelica Huston, Jeff Goldblum, Cate Blanchett, etc.).  These are fully formed characters as opposed to caricatures and are not overwhelmed by Anderson's inspired tomfoolery.

The biggest laugh here is the money paid to watch this film.  I gave the film over 45 minutes to grab my attention and it couldn't.  At best it's good for the insomniac as a means to fall asleep.  In most cases, the worst B-Flick manages at the least to capture your attention.  This film wasn't even remotely interesting.  None of the characters grab you for a connection.  The story and plot are short minded and carry very little weight of effort.  The effects are probably the most interesting and even so, they are antiquated techniques that proved better in something like Star Wars: Return of The Jedi.

If you want to be entertained with stop motion filmation and want something just a little more interesting, I suggest Clash of The Titans from the early 80's.

This movie is a dud and I think the cheese in Hollywood has slipped off of the cracker.  I mean it like this, if Hollywood isn't producing repeats and revisions of past TV and Feature performances, then they producing the weird and pathetic such as this film with no other objective than to rake in some more money.

Folks, when you use the word comedy, you are by definition implying something funny and able to provoke laughter.

Bill Murray was ok in this movie, but I think that the roles played by Owen Wilson (as Murray's son Ned) and Wilem Defoe (as Klaus) were better.  I was particular suprized and pleased with Defoe's role as Klaus.  Before I was only familar with Defoe for his vilanous role as Norman Osborne (Green Goblin) in Spiderman and for the role of the gruff, cross-dressing cop in Boondock Saints.  It was nice to see him play a convincing comic role.  I liked Wilson's role too but I can't see anything particularly special about, and liked Cate Blanchett's role as well.  Jeff Goldbum's character was not very original; he played an esentric, geeky scientist just like he played in Jurassic Park or Independence Day.

I guess that the main problem that I had with this movie was that there was just too much Bill Murrary in it.  Don't get me wrong, Murray easily held his own in many movies in his earlier career, but in this one I just got tired of him and his character.  The part of the movie that I hated was what happened to Owen Wilson's character.  I don't think it served any good purpose in the movie and seemed really out of place.  The only thing that it made me think was that this movie was really only about Murray and that the other characters were not important and were also not well developed.  After this point, the movie just drags on until it finishes.

1526812,4,B00005JNLQ,"This off-kilter but surprisingly involving movie feels like a jaundiced tribute to legendary oceanographer Jacques Cousteau, a reluctant father-needful son bonding parable and a contemporary update of ""Moby Dick"", all combined and filtered through the idiosyncratic eye of writer-director Wes Anderson. Along with co-writer Noah Baumbach, he has fashioned a fanciful episodic story around a cynical Cousteau-type celebrity named Steve Zissou, a role tailor-made for Bill Murray, who continues to resonate as an actor after his subtle, affecting work in Anderson's ""Rushmore"" and Sofia Coppola's ""Lost in Translation"". Here he even gets to play an action hero of sorts, as he defends his crew against rabid Filipino pirates onboard the elaborate though curiously antiquated Belafonte, a boat cut in half and filmed like a dollhouse stage set. Casting Murray is an essential component of the film's success since Zissou, now in his fifties, is not really passionate about the preservation of ocean life, at least not anymore, and much more into making movies, exhibiting the branding skills of a natural marketer and on the lookout for public relations and merchandising opportunities. Despite his business acumen, his reputation and fortunes have been on a long-term decline. It is near a personal abyss that he faces a tragedy, his lead diver and best friend has been killed by the never-seen jaguar shark in Part 1 of his documentary, and the media-savvy Zissou decides to take up his revenge against the shark in Part 2. Coincidentally, a mysterious ""son"" named Ned shows up, the product of a well-remembered affair. Zissou's initial idea of bonding is giving Ned a new name (Kingsley), personalized stationery and automatic membership as part of Team Zissou expedition, much to the jealous consternation of the blindly devoted engineer Klaus. Of course, women enter the picture and complicate matters, first in the form of Zissou's cold-fish ex-wife and business partner, Eleanor, who seems to be taking up with his bisexual nemesis, Hennessey, and second, with Jane, the pregnant and persistent journalist who eventually takes up with Ned. The convoluted elements somehow come together but not before all the strands intertwine in unexpected ways, whether it is on the Belafonte, the vertically impressive Operation Henessey Underwater Sea-Laboratory, or the remote island where the pirates have holed up in an abandoned resort hotel.

A well-selected cast does exceptional work among the discombobulated shenanigans. The currently overexposed Owen Wilson portrays Ned/Kingsley with a believable navet that makes you wonder - in a good way - how disingenuous his character may be. Willem Dafoe, of all people, makes Klaus such a touching and hilarious character that you can quite understand his pathetic pleas for attention from Zissou. The regal-bearing Anjelica Huston is in razor-sharp ""Grifters""-mode as Eleanor, and the typically brilliant Cate Blanchett makes the most of what is a wan observational role. Jeff Goldblum plays the slick Hennessey as well, Jeff Goldblum, and ""Harold and Maude"" cult personality Bud Cort makes a welcome return as the bond company milquetoast who gets taken hostage by the pirates. All the visual elements are great fun. Anderson smartly chooses to use Ray Harryhausen's old-fashioned stop-animation technique to produce the film's special effects, courtesy of Henry Selick, which mainly focus on the outrageous marine life. Robert Yeoman provides flexible camerawork, which emphasizes less on the actors and more on the creative production design by Mark Friedberg, especially of the somewhat dilapidated Belafonte. Ex-Devo lead singer Mark Mothersbaugh has composed the fittingly quirky score, which includes acoustic musical interludes by Seu Jorge, the Brazilian crew member who strums his guitar and sings David Bowie classics in Portuguese. And I do love the walking sequence under the final credits, which was lifted from the 1984 cult film, ""The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension"".

As usual, Criterion does an amazing job with extras on the two-disc set beginning with the smart audio commentary track by Anderson and Baumbach, which is recorded over some muffled restaurant noises, apparently where they jointly worked on the script. I only wish Murray participated on some of the audio. On the first disc, other than the movie, there is a brief behind-the-scenes featurette, this one done for the STARZ network, as well as a series of brief, deleted snippets that add some context but were understandably excised to maintain the story's pacing. On the second disc, entitled appropriately ""Supplements"", there is a making-of documentary, ""This Is an Adventure""; superfluous character portraits by Wilson, Blanchett and Seymour Cassel, who plays the non-verbal role of Zissou's best friend at the beginning; an insightful video journal by Matthew Gray Gubler, who plays Intern #1; twelve video performances of Jorge; and video interviews with Anderson, Baumbach and Mothersbaugh. It's almost overwhelming but not quite.",1116028800,3,5091,5.459390862944162
1526813,2,B00005JNLQ,"What do you get when you combine a fabulously talented cast, a technicolor array of adorable animated sea creatures, and a sultry Brazilian guitarist singing David Bowie songs in Portuguese?  Unfortunately, nothing profound or memorable.  The filmmaker definitely used some innovative techniques, and takes the concept of ""quirky"" to new extremes.  But despite the film's frantic efforts to entertain, and a few laugh-out-loud moments, most of the scenes just barely held my attention.  What's missing is a decent screenplay.  Some of the satirical treatments of organizations such as the Cousteau Society and their supporters were mildly amusing, and Bill Murray's dark and morally ambiguous character was well drawn.  But many of the scenes seemed like amateur home-movie level filler that had been improvised on the set.  It's as though a chef took truffles, caviar, and chocolate, and then tried to turn them into a tasty dish by cooking them all together in big bland pastry shell.  If this film had been produced on a very limited budget it would have been a praiseworthy effort, but other filmmakers have achieved vastly superior results with far fewer resources.  And a PS to those loyalists about to click the ""not helpful"" button -- just a reminder that ""not helpful"" means something other than ""I disagree""; I don't criticize this film out of malice, but rather to voice an objection to the epidemic of overblown and mediocre films out there.",1116028800,6,1453,5.122881355932203
1526814,1,B00005JNLQ,"I disagree with other reviewers that those of us who find Wes Anderson's work pointless and not funny are therefore mindless and of the 'something about Mary' variety. Thinking is not something you can do in this film because it is not a logical work. How much reality can you suspend? Bill Murray is brilliant as always and carries the film by himself. Some of the lines in the script are brilliant. But I don't agree that you can write a brilliant movie with everyone just wandering around lost in space - or out to sea, if you like. And I don't think you can blame the script writers totally for characters that are two-dimensional. The actors have to take part of the blame. Anjelica Houston replays 'Morticia'. Owen Wilson comes from the Kevin Costner school of acting - 'running the emotional gamut from A to B' - how is it that non-actors get so much work? Willem Defoe must have done this for the money - although I think he gets a kick out of his part. Cate Blanchett never seems to understand who she is but does what she can. Jeff Goldblum does a take on George Hamilton complete with tan and slicked back hair. What a waste of major talents. Definitely don't buy this until you've watched it first to see which 'camp' you fall in, or perhaps how 'campy' you actually are.",1116028800,14,1283,4.440677966101695
1526815,5,B00005JNLQ,"A review I read in Sight & Sound pulled their own metaphor from the movie that I found interesting.  Towards the beginning when Zissou fights the photographer and inadvertaintly pops the bag the crayon-pony fish was in and he then drops it into a cup and carries it away.  An interesting creature obviously not of this world but trapped in small quarters to only swin around in the same water forever.  Now don't get me wrong, The Royal Tenenbaums is one of my favorite films of all time but Wes needs to move on.  In Rushmore when Max Fisher wrote and directed plays as the film was being segmented by curtains giving the impression that life is also a play you're writing every second. I thought this was very insightful and brilliant; however, if we move forward two films he's still trying to tap into that same well with the Belafonte being divided in half so you get the feeling they're on stage.  Judging this film alone, it's a very creative gesture that doesn't tie in completely but is certainly welcomed.  But when you look at the rest of Wes' repertoire you see it's just variations on the same expression.  Despite that, there is much oringinality to this film that does, like all his work, spill over into different meanings and directions.  For instance, Tenenbaums was a very slow paced film where not really anything happened plot wise (as most character studies are).  So to go from that to a ""high seas adventure-comedy"" is a nice step forward.  As well as all the stop-motion sea-creatures making this Anderson's most surreal film to date.  But aside from that the main piont of the film is still the same as always.  Poor excuses for fathers and people who are too involved in their own worlds to see beyond themselves (melancholy) until a tragedy happens and they come together and realize the worth of each other (redemption).  As much as this failure to develop bugs me, my only legitimate complaint though is, like with most people, the script.  Now I know this is not an ensemble cast piece like Tenenbaums but even the secondary characters need more room to breath.  All the sedondary characters are interesting (Ned, Klaus, Elenore,  Jane, and Alistair if you wish) and diverse enough however, Wes doesn't let them stretch beyond ""what can they do to serve/avoid Steve"".  Bottle Rocket, Rushmore, and The Royal Tenenbaums were written brilliantly with a perfect balance between everyone.  So I don't know if I should be blaming the new co-writer Noah Baumbach, or maybe Wes just slipped up in editing.  Regardless it's still a wonderful film, sadly just short of a masterpiece but you can tell he can do much better eventhough the direction is still top notch (so nothing to complain about there).  His next film is going to be an adaptation of Ronald Dahl's ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox"" and will be done in all stop-motion.  So it seems our beloved director will infact finally move on.

So I think it's a testament to the quality of this film that I really, really liked it.  Anderson is getting more confident and creative, and I feel like his sense of humor (always dark and ironic) fits perfectly with Bill Murray's delivery.

Steve and his film crew sail the seas in order to track down the mysterious ""jaguar shark"" that ate his long time partner while filming a documentary that could put Steve back on top. ""The Life Aquatic"" is intelligently written, full of dark humor and irony.

In my opinion, Wes Anderon is one of the most original filmmakers in Hollywood today. His films are original and entertaining. Even Martin Scorsese believes that he is ""The Next Scorsese"". This is probably my least favorite of the films that Wes Anderson has directed, but it's a great film, nevertheless.

Seeing the previews for this film, my expectation was that it would be subtle but funny. If the comedy was there, it was so subtle that I, and many others, missed it.

In ""Lost in Translation,"" Bill Murray proved that he's still got it at this point in his career. ""Life Aquatic"" was a definite squandering of his considerable skills and a waste of everyone's time in general.",1115942400,6,562,4.3428571428571425

I was at least hoping for a Lost in Translation type movie, but  every character was a one-dimensional spoof that I found unfunny and uninteresting.  Murray sleepwalks through his performance as the lead character and Wilson is a toned down version of all his other characters he's ever played.  I was very disappointed in this one.",1115942400,6,521,4.886363636363637
1526900,5,B00005JNLQ,"I like Wes Anderson's quirky and some times dark usually subtle sense of humor, his arty treatment to film and his concentration on interpersonal relationships. He has the skillful literate ability to show people as buffoons while at the same time being very touching. His banter between characters can be hilarious. It is a winning formula that continues in The Life Aquatic.
Famed marine explorer Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) has a number of problems. His best friend was recently eaten by a shark, his fan base is shrinking and his rival is getting all of the available grant money. Then out of nowhere Ned Plimpton (played by Owen Wilson) appears to his rescue - however Plimpton just might be Zissou's son (the father-son theme is something we find reoccurring in Anderson films).
Off the wacky crew (some of Anderson's standard players) go to find the shark that killed Zissou's friend. Murray and Wilson are magical together. The retro (and sometimes psychedelic) special effects add more of the weirdness for which Anderson is famous. And like in many of Anderson's films a liberal use of familiar tunes is used, this time a lot of David Bowie (nice odd ball early Bowie - Anderson is definitely a man after my own heart) and one Iggy and the Stooges classic, which typical to form are incredibly appropriate. A great cast (which includes William DaFoe and Bud Cort) helps to make this movie a winner.
Second discs are now in vogue in selling DVDs and the second disc depending on the movie is sometimes a hit or miss. The extras in this package are  exceptional and add to the package.

1526901,3,B00005JNLQ,"This movie is a must see for any Bill Murray fan. Bill plays Steve Zizzou, a marine documentary maker who is hanging on to the end of the thin rope of his carrer. The premise of this film is the hunt for the jaguar shark who ate Steve's best friend on the previous journey.
I enjoyed the rollercoaster story line which included bouts with pirates, stealing equipment from his arch enemy, and dealing with the female equasion represented by Angelica Houston and Cate Blanchette. The movie had some Tim Burton-esq qualities such as the candy-stripped sea life and the jaguar shark itself which add an independent film charm to the overall theme.
I gave the movie 3 stars for the lack of character developement. The director realy did not take advantage of the all-star cast by limiting their scope in the movie. Other than that, I found it entertaining and charming. Bill Murray was again brilliant, and had great support from the rest of the cast.

I loved this film and everything about it. From the action/adventure storyline to Bill Murray's deadpan timing, classic stuff here.

1526988,4,B00005JNLQ,"The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is very unique movie, but I didn't find it to be funny. Perhaps Wes Anderson had intended to make this film an adventure drama with a twist on family and relationship issues. It's a very strong followup film for the Oscar-nominated Bill Murray(Lost In Translation), especially he gets to carry this movie, and flexing his acting muscles opposite some of the finest actors in the industry including Willem Dafoe and Anjelica Huston. Even if this film doesn't generate much laughs, it still has plenty of touching moments, and the underwater scenes are total eyecandy. Actually in the bonus disc, I found out that some of the marine life are puppets.

Murray played Captain Steve Zissou, and he's an acclaimed aquatic documentary film maker. His best friend in the team was killed by the rare and gigantic Jaguar Shark during a mission. He intended to go out to sea to kill it and  capture it on film and show the world. Meanwhile, a new member(Ned/Owen Wilson) joins the team for the adventure, and he confessed to Zissou that he's actually his son. Anjelica Huston played Zissou's wife, whose  parents are extremely wealthy. They are not happy together, and Zissou actually has for thing for the five-month pregnant and single reporter(Jane) played Cate Blanchett, but she's interested in Ned. Dafoe is Zissou's sidekick(Klaus) , who speaks in a strange German accent, and feels underused. Jeff Goldblum(Alistaire) is Zissou's vival, but he's severely underused in this film.

The gun fight scene was kind of tacky, but the music composed by Mark Mothersbaugh really worked for this movie thoroughly. The mostly electronic composed score is perfect for floating and bouncy feel of this movie. I also enjoyed watching the landscapes captured along the water.

I actually found Owen Wilson's performance to be quite impressive and wonderful. His scenes with Murray are quite touching.",1115683200,,1917,5.073015873015873
1526989,2,B00005JNLQ,"It will start the moment I post this review. An army of Wes Anderson fans will vote, and my thoughts on this film will overwhelmingly be deemed 'not helpful.'

Of course, these folks will have already rushed out and bought their copies of ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou,"" so, in an odd way, their votes will be completely accurate. Reading my little rant will neither get them their money back nor convince them that, really, this just isn't a very good movie. As spiteful as their little mouse-click may be, reading this review really WON'T help them. But if you haven't yet parted with your hard-earned dollars to purchase your copy of director Wes Anderson's latest, please at least let me make my case before you vote or, more importantly, buy.

What you have to understand, here, is that I loved ""Bottle Rocket."" LOVED it! And ""Rushmore?"" Come on! WAAAY loved it!! I was somewhat less thrilled with ""The Royal Tenenbaums,"" but what the heck? It had its moments and, as Meatloaf once taught us, 'two out of three ain't bad.'

Which brings us to this, Anderson's fourth feature. Somehow, with ""The Life Aquatic,"" a bright, literate filmmaker has turned out a flick that's just as flat and void of life as the current Hollywood dreck his fans surely revile. Not only is this film no better than something as pointless as, say, ""Blade - Trinity,"" it's also a bore to have to sit through. To endure ""The Life Aquatic,"" we the audience have the misfortune of watching a bunch of people we can't care much about spending a long time doing...well...nothing especially interesting. Sure, Bill Murray, Cate Blanchett, Owen Wilson and the rest bring their game. But even such a (truly) stellar ensemble can't rise above the inertia of a film that feels like it just never quite gets started.

The problem is not, as Andersonphiles would kid themselves, that the humor is sooo subtle that most people won't get it. Instead, Anderson breaks the one rule that matters most when it comes to being funny (that is: BE FUNNY). Unlike in his earlier films in which quirkiness was tossed in to augment and accent humor, in ""The Life Aquatic,"" Anderson seems to think that quirkiness in and of itself is a perfectly suitable substitute for humor. So, those characters you can't care much about? Those folks who spend two hours hopping around from one tepid adventure to another? Well, they're not very funny, either. Oh, some of 'em are quirky, alright...just not funny.

To be sure, ""The Life Aquatic,"" will have its following. Or, more accurately, its defenders among Wes Anderson's fan base. But like Stanley ""Eyes Wide Shut"" Kubrick, John ""Reindeer Games"" Frankenheimer and other notable directors before him, Wes Anderson is bound to shoot a blank now and then. So, ready that mouse, Andersonphiles! Call me unhelpful if you must, but ""The Life Aquatic"" is a case of a good director making a not-very-good movie.",1115683200,22,2906,4.804
1526990,5,B00005JNLQ,"There's always a certain amount of trepidation when a filmmaker like Wes Anderson, known for making intimate and personal films, starts making movies on a more ambitious scale - bigger budgets and movie stars in an attempt to appeal to larger audience - that he will lose all of the qualities that made his movies so interesting in the first place. Easily his most accomplished film, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou merges his stylized dialogue and quirky characters with elaborate sets and action set pieces in an exotic locale.

Anderson's career has been building up to this film. With The Royal Tenenbaums, Anderson was able to juggle a large cast of name stars while still maintaining his artistic integrity. With Life Aquatic, he continues to use stars but has upped the ante in production values and scope. However, he has not lost the intimate feeling that all of his movies possess. No matter how ambitious or big the scale, his films have hand-crafted feel to them. One gets the feeling that Anderson cares about every detail an every aspect and it is this personal touch that makes his movies so unique.

On the first DVD there are nine deleted scenes that feature some nice little bits of business between characters. There is nothing too significant for the most part and these were rightly cut out.

There is a theatrical trailer.

Also included is an audio commentary by Wes Anderson and co-screenwriter Noah Baumbach recorded at the restaurant in New York City where they worked on the screenplay. This is an engaging and thoughtful track as the two men touch upon the film's themes in an unpretentious way.

""Starz on the Set"" is a 14-minute featurette. It is fairly standard press kit material as Anderson and the cast talk about the movie's plot and their characters with lots of clips from the film.

The second disc features a collection of stills taken during filming.

""The Look Aquatic"" is a brief look at how the specific world that Anderson wanted to depict in his film was achieved, including the large set of the cross-section of the Zissou's ship, the Belafonte.

In ""Creating a Scene,"" the cast talk about Anderson's style of filmmaking and how they contribute to it.

There is an excellent interview with long-time Anderson composer, Mark Mothersbaugh. Mothersbaugh talks about his transition from Devo to scoring movies and TV shows (his first gig was Pee-Wee's Playhouse) and gives insight into his creative process.

""Mondo Monda"" is an amusing parody of an Italian talk show hosted by Antonio Monda who interviews Anderson and Baumbach in Italian while the two men struggle to understand what he's saying.

""Seu Jorge Performs David Bowie"" features footage of the Brazilian recording artist performing ten Bowie songs in their entirety in Portuguese on the set of the film. Some were used in the film.

""Aquatic Life"" is a fascinating look at how the undersea creatures were made via stop-motion animation by Henry Selick and his team and then inserted into the movie via computer.

The ""Esteban"" featurette follows Seymour Cassel around in Italy as he buys some cigars, talks about John Cassavetes and his movies and we see him being directed by Anderson on the underwater set of the movie.

The centerpiece of the supplemental material is ""This is an Adventure,"" 51 minute documentary made by Albert Maysles, Antonio Ferrera and Matthew Prinzing during filming in 2003. We get to see various scenes being shot in this absorbing doc.

""Intern Video Journal"" is a behind-the-scenes featurette shot and edited by ""Intern #1"" Matthew Gray Gubler. He also documents what the cast and crew do between takes - sleeping, playing foosball and basically messing around to alleviate the boredom.

There is also a gallery of paintings of the characters, logos and poster that were featured in the movie.

""Ned"" is a brief interview with Owen Wilson as he talks about his character.

Also included is a look at the costumes designed for the movie.

Finally, there is a brief look at Cate Blanchett's character with the actress talking about how she incorporated her real-life pregnancy in the role.",1115683200,67,4125,4.934971098265896

1526993,5,B00005JNLQ,"The most obvious observation of Wes Anderson films that can be made is that the audience will either love them or hate them, and that would be true. The most overused and strangely misleading observation is that they're snob-infested and consumed in their own deadpan wit. And that's where ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" comes in with the story of a pothead oceanographer and his goofy crew, including a brazilian musician who's there simply to play David Bowie songs acoustic in portugese (rock) and his could-be son. Some people must not give their brains much credit if they've deemed this movie over their heads, and others who take themselves too seriously will feel that this movie is too silly. It's a comedy people, not brain surgery. This needs no decoding, it just needs minds that haven't already decided what Wes Anderson is or isn't. This is by far the most fun and outlandish of his films, and even though it's not as subtle as The Royal Tenenbaums, which IS outlandish in it's own quiet half-parody of J. D. Salinger novels, this is his most accessible movie and it's not bad. I will say that the visuals are really a treat, as they're not as much impressive in any realistic sort of fashion, but rather in it's ability to root out the essence of what the image of the movie is putting forth and creating the whole world in which the film revolves within it, making every frame a snapshot into this snow-globe storybook dreamworld of the ocean. The humor is timeless and hilarious; absolute must-see scenes include Zissou's rock and roll 70s copshow-esque shootout (set to the delightfull tunes of non other than Iggy himself), the ruscue mission of the bond-company stooge, and of course, the hilarious openning documentary. As for the Criterion Collection release, this is no exception to their series. I highly doubt Criterion will ever release anything below impeccable quality; the features outnumber those found on the Criterion releases of ""Rushmore"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and frankly, if you buy all three they look really cool lined up, and if you're a Wes Anderson fanatic I think you'll be one happy camper. I can't recommend a better investment for anyone willing to try out an innovative new ""dramaty"" made by the guy who's made his own genre in only 4 movies.",1115424000,5,2299,4.822784810126582
1526994,5,B00005JNLQ,"At first glance, The Life Aquatica with Steve Zissou by Wes Anderson seems to be an awkward visual feast with no chemistry, or feel, as it is a film about making a documentary.  In a sense the acting and filming seem quaint, as the characters communicate, but never engage in any meaningful exchange of words.  This leaves the viewer with a feeling of detachment and discontent, as it produces an atmosphere of problematic motionlessness with vague ripples.  Much of the film seems to go on forever while very little time has actually has passed.  A sense of being adrift in an infinite void comes to mind, but also the same feeling a person has when being stuck on the ocean with no land in sight is thought of.  This suggests that Anderson tries to instill a sense of oceanic separation in the audience, which he does with brilliant direction.

Most of the film takes place at sea; however, the film opens with a premier of Steve Zissou's (Bill Murray) recent documentary in which he lost his best friend to what he calls a Jaguar Shark.  In the question and answer session after the film, someone asks Steve why he would kill the shark that might be an endangered species.  To this Steve simply responds, ""Revenge."" Later Steve drifts around in melancholy while people call on him to meet more people.  This scene has a strong sense of symbolic meaning, as the audience could empathize with Steve who appears much like a bottled message that drifts around on the ocean without contacting land.  The scene also provides the notion that Steve tries to bottle up everything within him, as he does not express much emotion.

The party drifts from the theater to the Belafonte, the ship from which Steve and his crew run their marine operations, where Steve for the first time meets his 30-year old pilot son, Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson).  The emotional rift between Steve and Ned is obvious, yet a peculiar connection appears between the two.  The film continues intermittently to explore the reunion between the father and the long lost son, as Steve brings him under his wing by letting him join the Zissou organization.  Throughout the film, the audience gets to witness how Steve maintains his emotional distance to Ned.  Steve's persona seems to affect everything onboard the Belafonte, as the crew seems discontent with Steve's leadership while others are hurt by his choices.  Eventually all of the problems bottled up problems begin to seep out little by little, as Steve discovers that he is loosing control of his venture to avenge the death of his friend.

Steve restrains his feelings while small portions seep out creating ripples in his personal and professional life while it later creates havoc onboard the Belafonte.  These ripples affect his relationship with his wife Eleanor Zissou (Anjelica Huston), as their strained relationship seems to slowly dissolve.  Jane Winslett-Richardson (Cate Blanchett), a pregnant British reporter, goes on the expedition for the Jaguar Shark.  When Steve meets her he finds her attractive while also treating her with a level of distrust.  His professional attitude seems to diminish, as he continues to treat people unusually.  Even his faithful assistant Klaus Daimler (Willem Dafoe) gradually becomes hostile toward Ned.  This hostility seems to source from Klaus' anxiety of his importance aboard the Belafonte, which is much due to Steve's emotional dilemma and the arrival of Ned.

Despite the difficulties, the audience gets to witness a voyage of melancholy and emotional retribution that pays off big dividends, as cognitive recognition of self-destruction finds a solution.  This ends up being a solution where trust, open communication, and honest affection for one another turn the pages away from anxious motionlessness and ripples of resentment.  Through the solution, Anderson presents the idea that the oceans waves can also be harmoniously soothing and comforting, as he maximizes on the analogy that the sea offers in the film.  This offers the idea that personal emotional storm is analogous to the eye of a hurricane where nothing can enter or exit without damage.  Nonetheless, all hurricanes eventually die off leaving the survivor in a chaotic mess where everything around has been tossed around.  Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou does exactly what the hurricane does; as the serene waves of solution provides ultimate closure for the audience.

Initially, the film gives the impression to be a quirky cinematic journey that Anderson has offered through his pervious wittingly compelling Bottle Rocket (1996), or his clever Rushmore (1998).  Despite the similarities with his previous films, Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou displays another level of Anderson's artistic side, as he elaborates on the origin of human detachment through marvelously cool stop-motion of sea creatures and a clever performance from a brilliant cast.  The camera work displays additional elements that enhance the feeling of being on the ocean while framing each scene in a way that accentuates distance and emptiness.  There is also a sequence in the film that maps out the boat that Anderson incorporated into the film, which brings to mind a scene from Tout Va Bien (1972) where Jean-Luc Godard maps out the meat factory.  Lastly, the score is excellent; as the main score seems to be missing something while it provides a sound that makes one think of underwater adventure. Combined, all the filmmaking facets pour out a sympathetic tale of distance and belonging that leaves the audience in astonishing wonder.",1115251200,6,5564,5.084708470847085

1527077,4,B00005JNLQ,"Late in the film, a kid comes up to Bill Murray, who asks him how old he is. The kid says, ""eleven-and-a-half,"" to which Murray says something like, ""...that's the best age.""

That is this film in a nutshell. It's as if it were made by a daydreaming, precocious eleven-and-a-half-year-old. Fanciful creatures. Cutaway diagrams of impossible vessels. Pirates. It's a mish-mash of ideas in a shaggy-dog story. I enjoyed it, to be sure, but I found its desultory, haphazard nature frustrating. I can't wait to see the DVD, though, because I'm guessing that it will get better with repeated viewing.

I loved Rushmore. I loved Bottle Rocket. I liked Royal Tenenbaums. And, despite my lukewarm response to Life Aquatic, it must be said that it's better by far then 99.99% of the crap that's issued by Hollywood at the moment.",1115164800,,820,4.85
1527078,5,B00005JNLQ,"There are very few movie makers who I geniunely like as much as Wes Anderson.  His movies are always a great combination of dark humor, cynicism, and heart touching warmth.  Life Aquatic is no exception to this; you are laughing out loud at the comments that Murray (as Zissou) makes, or are touched by the burgeoning relationship between Wilson and Blanchett.  What more is there to say?  Great cast, great director, good jokes, good times, and a good good ending.  Almost forgot to mention, Anderson is one of the rare people in this day and age who is not afraid to make his audience sad.  Has anyone else noticed that just about every movie nowadays gets a happy ending?  Wes Anderson, thank you for being unafraid of the audience, and making them (the audience) laugh and cry at the same time.",1114992000,4,798,4.617021276595745

1527081,3,B00005JNLQ,"I know, I know. Everyone SAYS they are a big Wes Anderson fan just to give their review some credibility, but I really am. I loved Bottle Rocket, Rushmore, and The Royal Tenenbaums. Of the three, Rushmore was by far my favorite- and it's the one I have an emotional connection with.

So needless to say, I looked forward to The Life Aquatic immensely- literally the first month after Tenenbaums was released, when there was a rumor that Wes's next project would be an ""undersea adventure"". So what's wrong with it? I don't know really, other than to say that it just comes off as very very flat. The performances are kind of tepid, and for the first time in a Wes Anderson movie, I didn't really care about the characters. I honestly believe that this is partly due to Owen Wilson's absence in writing the screenplay- he had left the project early on because he is focusing on acting. Well whatever the reason, I just didn't care for this movie, and I did NOT care to see it again in the theater. Will I buy the dvd? Probably.. like I said, I am a fan and I would like to find out what Wes was thinking when he made this. I don't know- maybe I will learn to love it after listening to the commentary.",1113782400,16,1200,4.3097345132743365

I did not give a single laugh at this intelligent and SO BORING movie! Do not know why but Intelligent humour never makes me laugh!

Everything is artificial - yes I know its on purpose - but isn't funny. I never leave theatres in a middle of a movie... but this is my first one - and Im proud I do it! Anyway I see at least 1h30m but I could not stay anymore.

What a waste of talents. Bill Murray, Angelica Houston, Willem Dafoe, Cate Blanchett, Jeff Goldblum (is the kick on the dog any funny??!! even if it was on purppose?), Michael Gambon...

Bill Murray has done a great performance in the beauty - and subtle - Lost In Translation. Here I see him drowned in this WallPaper-magazine-70's-bubblegum-kind-of-movie.

This is a sort of film for people who like Spike Jonze - Adaptation or Being John Malkovich! I don't like it either - although I like his work as a video director.

WHY this new directors like Wes Anderson, Quentin Tarantino or Spike Jonze are doing a lot of movies if they were in 1975? Is this a new sort of cinema?

Camp movie? Perhaps... I'd rather prefer and strongly recommend camp movies such as Sideways, Amelie, Delicatessen, Fargo, Pulp Fiction, Eraserhead and specially Lost In Translation!

Poor Jacques Cousteau...

The worst movie I've seen in years...

1527084,5,B00005JNLQ,"We travelled on wet autumn night to see this movie, not sure what to expect. We were drawn by the cast and its unfavourable reviews and as is so typical with unfavourable reviews, we loved it.

I am not going to review the acting or the directing or its production value, since they are but a sideshow to the incredible way Wes Anderson has given us a truly respectful satire of the life of Jacques Cousteau.

To present a movie such as this, and call it another Bill Murray comedy is really an insult.  From its Red Knitted Hats, to cheesy uniforms and retro, clunky old equipment, it shows the ""behind-the-scenes"" life of a famous naturalist from the golden era of armchair exploration.  As was so typical of Cousteau, there was more drama behind the scenes than in his documentaries, which eventually took a backseat to his real life.  Anderson shows this by mimicing Cousteaus production styles in the ""docu-features"" shown in the movie, which are bad on purpose, to the stop motion sea creatures which are all fantastic and completely unbelievable.  But the drama onboard the Belafonte no doubt was pretty typical when compared to the Calypso, Cousteau's real ship.

Zissou is completely dysfunctional, except for the support of his estranged wife and his band of sycophantical crew.  What a terrific interpration of the real Cousteau.  A man with a dream to show us the oceans, a true eccentric, right down to the illegitemate son and the tragic loss of some of the crew.  And while it certainly is satirical, Cousteau's inability to be a loving father (yet having two complete families at the same time and one not knowing the other!!) is echoed when Bill Murray says to Owen Wilson ""I don't like fathers, so I never wanted to be one.""

An under-rated masterpiece of satire, that maintains the dignity of its subject.  The most original and enjoyable movie I have seen in a long, long time.",1112140800,9,1897,4.732522796352583

7940550,5,B00005JNLQ,"The Life Aquatic held my attention, appearing on late-night TV. It takes a lot to do that. It could be that Bill Murry, late in his career, has had many acclaimed performances in acclaimed films so I was more eager to see what was going on in this one. Those films, by the way, are not films I've managed to see. The film has Jeff Goldbloom in it as well. Ever since 'The Big Chill', I've loved every film with Jeff Goldbloom. If any actor were to play my life it would be Mr. Goldbloom (or so I think!).

Even in the first scene (and you always miss some part of the movie, usually the beginning, watching on television), the end of the first scene, where the protagonist's friend is eaten by a shark, it's fairly clear this is a comedy of some kind. The film never settles into a regular pattern. That is a good thing. You spend the entire film wondering what is going on. There's the pleasure of knowing the film is a comedy. I think the filmmakers play on that. I believe Nietzsche once described laughter as being caused by relief that a stressful situation is over. We take pleasure in knowing that what we are seeing is a joke - or getting the joke.

The Life Aquatic is like 4 films in one. It's a comedy. It's a film that takes you behind the scene; we get to see how films and documentaries are made. The film always has us wondering if is making profound statements regarding real life. The film is a nature documentary.

There's a scene late in the movie where an aging, dignified, bespectacled character, involved in financing or something, comes on board and makes an important point, then says 'what's my line again'? You've forgotten, even in this comedy, the action isn't quite real. Perhaps by doing this, the film keeps a-hold of our attention.

Late in the film, despite its absurdities, how everything in the film is really fake, I found myself Wanting this film to be made. At the end of the film, the crew stare in awe at the Jaguar Shark passing by their submersible. I took to it to be that this one scene was real, at least, in the film, they really are looking at this rare and exotic animal.

I thought this would be a really short review, but it's not. To step outside the film . . . I'm not sure what these nature shows are doing. It might seem these zoos and animal shows and documentaries are promoting a kind of white supremacy or a kind of human supremacy. Even when we just watch, I wonder if it sometimes mocks animals. Perhaps they understand on some level that we don't have to hunt for our food and it unsettles them being watched. We're busy tagging them and filming them and capturing them and watching them, I wonder if it would be better if, for the most part, we simply left them alone.",1517443200,,2730,4.355599214145383
