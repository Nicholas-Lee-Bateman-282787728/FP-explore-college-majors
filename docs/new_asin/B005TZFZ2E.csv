4892943,4,B005TZFZ2E,"For the past two years, WWE has been releasing an anthology of matches & moments from their main two brands of TV (RAW & SmackDown) on their own separate DVD sets but they combined them both into one mega set for the year of 2011.  Unlike the previous sets where the current announce team hosted the set, this one is hosted strictly by Josh Matthews.  Along with the matches include various moments throughout the year including The Rock's return to WWE & John Cena's response the following week, the referee for Lawler vs. Cole at WrestleMania is announced, ""The Rock"" attacks John Cena, the confrontation between Undertaker & Triple H & Shawn Michaels, Edge's farewell on SmackDown, R-Truth speaks to the ""Little Jimmy"", Miz fires Alex Riley, C.M. Punk drops his ""pipe bomb"",  Mr. McMahon is relieved of his duties; The Cutting Edge with Randy Orton & Mark Henry & the ""Vote Of No Confidence"" with Undertaker & Triple H's back to back returns to WWE, The Rock & John Cena face to face confrontations before & after WrestleMania, C.M. Punk's public contract negotiation with Mr. McMahon on the Blu-Ray edition.

Falls Count Anywhere Match: WWE Champion The Miz vs. John Morrison - Both men started brawling right away taking the fight to the stage where Miz was slammed on the ramp causing Alex Riley to get involved & Morrison fighting both men off yet still getting his hits in like driving Miz head first into the stage & diving off the stage onto both men but Miz was able to gain control & slowed the pace down.  Both men traded momentum throughout the match with it coming down to one man making a high risk move that didn't pay off & left an opening for the other to capitalize on.
""RAW"" Jan. 3

Intercontinental Champion Dolph Ziggler vs. Kofi Kingston - Dolph grounded Kofi with a side headlock early only for Kofi to gain momentum with a miscue by Dolph. Both traded momentum by countering & escaping each others moves from the Trouble In Paradise to a sleeper to the S.O.S. to a superplex. They had a series of matches throughout the years & this was one of the better ones but stay tuned afterwords as we got a bonus match afterwords.
""SmackDown"" Jan. 7
[Superstar Collection: Kofi Kingston]

2 Out Of 3 Falls Match: Rey Mysterio vs. Alberto Del Rio - Del Rio came out more aggressive than we've seen him before to the point where the first fall was decided very quickly causing Mysterio to step his game up & catch Del Rio off guard.  Rio kept going for the arm he previous injured on Mysterio with moves like Jericho's codebreaker onto the arm & yanking the arm over the top rope while Mysterio took some risk of his own like a top rope battery ram, body scissors into a DDT, and top rope dive onto both Del Rio & Ricardo.  These two hadn't had a bad match & this was no exception
""SmackDown"" - Jan. 7

Divas Champion Natalya vs. Melina - Melina had a new ""old"" attitude here & we saw it here from the start as she drove her shoulder into Natayla so hard that she went through the ropes to the floor before taking the action back into the ring with a face stomp & a leg scissors locking Natayla's arms before she fought back powering out of the hold & applying a sharpshooter that was leaned back so far that it almost looked like Melina was going to be snapped in two.  The match didn't go long (as usual with the divas) but was aggressive in the time they had it.
""RAW"" - Jan. 24

Daniel Bryan vs. The Miz - For those who aren't a fan of the Michael Cole ""pro-Miz/anti-Bryan"" heel character on commentary then MUTE this match as he's in heavy overload to the point where Josh Mathews couldn't get a word in half the time & Miz's apprentice Alex Riley also being on commentary didn't help matters either to the point where Cole cracked himself up with the heavy amount of sucking up he was doing for Miz.  Both men tried submissions early on & traded momentum throughout the match with both men taking some hard hits like Miz on the receiving end of Bryan's running knee off the apron & top rope missile dropkick while Miz applied a neckbreaker with Bryan hanging through the ropes & later face planted Bryan off his shoulders.  Not the quality of their previous two PPV encounters but still a good match.
""RAW"" - Feb. 14

World Champion Dolph Ziggler vs. Edge - This is under the ""Dolph Ziggler Coronation"" chapter as on the 600th Episode, Dolph was presented with the World Championship after acting General Manager Vickie Guerrero had stripped & fired Edge earlier in the show only for Teddy Long to return & not only rehire Edge but gave him his title shot right there.  The match was pretty short & sweet as this was more of a segment than anything but had some good back & forth action in that time as it started out as good moment for Dolph but ended up being one of the worst with an ending that he surely didn't expect at all.
""SmackDown"" - Feb. 18

Steel Cage Match: Christian vs. Alberto Del Rio - This was Del Rio's first cage match in WWE as Christian was still out for revenge for Del Rio taking him out of action for months while Teddy Long made this a cage match for all outside parties (Edge, Brodus Clay, Ricardo Rodriquez) couldn't get involved.  Rio tried to escape quickly counting an irish whip attempt but eventually did bring the fight with attempts to use the cage for a suplex, samoan drop, and later using the cage to grind Christian's face.  Christian regained the momentum countering a battery ram attempt into DDT while using the cage to his advantage throwing Del Rio into it various times.  Both men were able to counter each others attempts at victory like Christian's escape with the leaping side kick & countering Del Rio's cross armbreaker into a signature move of his own to the point where it came down to both men battling at the top of the cage.  This was the type of cage match that did come off as a grudge match but not a very violent contest.
""SmackDown"" - Mar. 18

Intercontinental Champion Kofi Kingston vs. Wade Barrett - Barrett's new group of The Corre was at ringside here as both men traded momentum throughout the contest with each man hitting a big move throughout the match like Barrett's big boot on Kofi that knocked him to the outside with his head hitting the apron on the way down while Kofi was able to his a huge flying crossbody but this was ultimately about the continued domination of Barrett & The Corre.
""SmackDown"" - Mar. 25

WWE Champion John Cena vs. The Miz - The rematch from WrestleMania the night after Cena regained the championship at Extreme Rules with the bonus factor of this episode of RAW being in Miami which was The Rock's hometown on the night Rock was celebrating his birthday.  Cena went for quick covers & even threw a dropkick before Miz gained control due to a distraction from Alex Riley.  They traded momentum with both men pulling off some heavy moves like Cena's STF & Miz's low DDT to the point where both men were able to survive each others signature moves.  I actually enjoyed this match more than their WrestleMania match.
""RAW"" - May 2

World Champion Christian vs. Randy Orton - Less than a week after winning the World Championship in a Ladder Match, Christian had to defend the championship here. Orton was in control early with Christian being able to regain control after an Orton clothesline that sent both men over the top rope to the floor with Orton's foot kicking Christian's head on the way down. Both men traded momentum pulling out all the stops as the match went on such as Christian's top rope offense of a missile dropkick & flying crossbody while Orton delivered his snap powerslam & hanging DDT before catching Christian in the middle of one high risk move too many. This was one of the best TV quality matches of the year (so far).
""SmackDown"" - May 6
[Randy Orton: Evolution Of A Viper]

World Champion Randy Orton vs. Sheamus w/special referee Christian - Both men were stiff against each other here with their elbows & clotheslines against each other to the point where Orton was rammed into the post back first while later being able to execute a superplex before both men were able to block & counter each others signature moves.  This wasn't as good as their previous PPV's encounters but was more about the role that Christian would play during & after the match.
""SmackDown"" - June 3

Elimination Match: John Cena, Randy Orton, Alex Riley vs. Christian, R-Truth, The Miz - Before the match, we saw the comedic encounter between 3 three heels pleading their case about how they were screwed over at the previous PPV.  This was a non-stop action match that did it's job in putting over the storylines with all the competitors involved while also using the classic tag team strategy of the heels singling out a member & working him over with double teaming & dirty tactics behind the referee building to a hot tag for the babyface team.
""RAW"" - June 20

Daniel Bryan vs. Cody Rhodes - Bryan got quick offense on Rhodes which caused Rhodes' then protege of Ted Dibiase to come to ringside in order for Rhodes to regain an advantage.  This was a solid TV encounter overall between both men but nothing special overall.
""SmackDown"" - June 24

Sin Cara vs. Christian - Sin Cara used his high flying fast paced offense to stay in control while Christian slowed the pace down whenever he could to keep the momentum in his favor.  Christian at one point went aerial himself with his diving headbutt while Sin Cara continued with his high risk offense such as a running head scissors off the apron but the main story here was the fact that Cara's offense was high risk working in the favor of Christian as he kept getting caught.
""SmackDown"" - July 1

WWE Champion Rey Mysterio vs. John Cena - With Punk walking about of the company as the WWE Champion & John Cena originally scheduled to be fired by Mr. McMahon that same night, a tournament started the next night to crown a new WWE Champion which Mysterio won the next week only for Cena to get his rematch for the championship against Mysterio later in the night.  Rey targeted Cena's legs with kicks while also using his speed advantage over him before Cena was able to get back on track with an impactful clothesline on the outside.  Both men were able to counter each others trademark offense from the 619 to Cena's shoulderblock & A.A. with Mysterio using Cena's own STF at one point that resulted in a sequence between both men countering each others moves while later Cena was able to catch him a few times in the middle of his attempted offense.  One of the best TV matches both men have had throughout the year but the bigger story was a return after the match leading the question of who is the WWE Champion still unsolved.
""RAW"" - July 25

Intercontinental Champion Ezekiel Jackson vs. Cody Rhodes - Ezekiel showcased his clear power advantage with repeated slams & tossing Cody around to the point where Rhodes had to try to hit & run from Jackson before being able to ground him with moves like a hammerlock & chinlock combination while Dibiase on the outside kept making distractions to the point where it was almost a glorified handicap match.  This match is only relevant for the result but nothing special past that.
""SmackDown"" - Aug. 12

Falls Count Anywhere Match: John Morrison vs. R-Truth - Former tag partners turned enemies started out in the ring but went to the floor with Morrison heavily in control with his risk risk par-kor offense such as the twisting suicide dive & leaping off a barricade to launch himself into spinning kick while Truth got his shots in with moves like a forward suplex onto the floor.  This match went all over the place from the floor to the crowd & back at ringside with the action you expect from this type of stipulation.
""RAW"" - Aug. 15

Daniel Bryan vs. Alberto Del Rio - Both men were holders of the Money In The Bank briefcases but Del Rio cashed his in the night before to win the WWE Championship.  Del Rio worked over Bryan's arm with various holds like the armbar, hammerlock & a codebreaker on the arm off the top rope before Bryan was able to eventually began to gain momentum with his kicks & running knee off the apron but kept hurting his own arm with moves like the flying clothesline & countering Del Rio's back superplex.  For those who are a fan of submission wrestling & in-ring storytelling, this was a real good match with the only downfall being that Michael Cole was in heavy ""anti-Bryan"" heel overload on commentary that I had to turn the volume down.
""SmackDown"" - Aug. 19

WWE Tag Team Champions David Otunga & Michael McGillicutty vs. Kofi Kingston & Evan Bourne - This was a pretty short & sweet basic tag match with Kofi & Bourne being on fire with their offense while Otunga & McGillicutty had to use tactics like isolation & distractions to have the action work in their favor but this was more about the birth of the tag team ""Air Boom"" more than anything else.
""RAW"" - Aug. 22

Steel Cage Match: World Championship Randy Orton vs. Christian - This was the final encounter between these two for the World Championship as Christian kept trying to escape early & even tried to come off the top rope onto Orton only to be caught with a dropkick in mid-air but Christian brought the fight to Orton using the cage to his advantage with a backdrop into the cage & grinding his face against it with his feet but Orton was able to use Christian's momentum against him causing him to hit the cage & even delivering a superplex that hurt himself as much as Christian.  Both men traded momentum throughout the match including one moment where they were both fighting at the top of the cage at one point while Christian continued to avoid the RKO throughout the match.  This wasn't the classic encounter that we got from their previous matches in the year but still a quality encounter.
""SmackDown"" - Aug. 30

Randy Orton vs. Cody Rhodes - The former Legacy members faced each other here with Orton taking control in the beginning working over the chest with stomps & forearms causing Cody to use his mask to get the advantage back by grounding Orton & working over his knee while also delivering offense like an impactful Alabama Slam.  They continued to trade momentum as there were moments like one man missed a move only for the other to deliver it while also countering one signature move into their own.  This was a solid match in what would end up being one of their first matches in their eventual feud throughout the fall.
""SmackDown"" - Sept. 9

Zack Ryder vs. Dolph Ziggler - In a nutshell, this was the match to start Ryder's chase for the U.S. Title & make a ""media clip"" moment with Hugh Jackman's involvement but past that, the match was around 4 minutes & too short for the match itself to be anything noteworthy.
""RAW"" - Sept. 19
[Superstar Collection: Zack Ryder]

Lumberjack Match: World Champion Mark Henry vs. Christian - After Christian kept demanding ""One More Match"" for the World Title so he got it here against Mark Henry who easily kept overpowering Christian by tossing him to the outside & up in the air while shoving him down causing Christian resorted to trying to use the ""hit & move"" offense to the point where it took two missile dropkicks to take him down.  The lumberjacks came into play at various times but were ultimately only bodies for Henry to showcase why he was called the ""World's Strongest Man"" while Christian was ultimately unable it was one special lumberjack that caused Christian to be unable to walk away from the match.  It was good for what it was.
""SmackDown"" - Sept. 23

C.M. Punk vs. Alberto Del Rio - John Cena was on commentary here as his two opponents in the upcoming Hell In A Cell match where against each other here & they made sure to acknowledge Cena at ringside as one of his opponents was actually thrown into him at ringside.  Both men went back & forth with the story of Del Rio focusing on Punk's head & arm coming heavily into play throughout the match with moves like the DDT, hammerlock, and a codebreaker on the arm but bigger picture was what happened after the match with the Hell In A Cell was lowered on everyone involved (including poor Ricardo Rodriquez) giving everyone a preview of the aggression that was coming in their PPV match.
""RAW"" - Sept. 26

John Cena, C.M. Punk, Sheamus, Kofi Kingston, Evan Bourne, Mason Ryan vs. Alberto Del Rio, Christian, Cody Rhodes, Dolph Ziggler, Jack Swagger, David Otunga - This was your basic multiman tag match were everyone had a chance to get the spotlight & showcase their skills with the highlights being Mason Ryan showcasing his strength by tossing Dolph over the top to the floor, the heels teamwork in grounding their opposition while cutting the ring in half, and the ending sequence where it was one big move after another.
""RAW"" - Oct. 3

John Cena vs. Sheamus w/special referee Triple H & Commentator C.M. Punk - The entire WWE roster walked out the week before except for these four men setting up these circumstances.  This was more of a segment than a match as ""the match"" only went a few short minutes before we saw Mr. McMahon appear in a case of ""deja vu"" from what happened to him only a few months earlier.
""RAW"" - Oct. 10

Mask vs. Mask: Sin Cara (Blue) vs. Sin Cara (Black) - This was the final encounter to determine who would be the real Sin Cara with the special added bonus of this taking place in the country of Mexico were mask matches hold a bigger value than anywhere else in the world.  Blue relied on a fast paced high risk offense using such moves as a head scissors & top rope crossbody while Black slowed down the pace using various submissions such as the camel clutch while also trying to remove the mask himself several times but Blue continued to pick up the pace before using Black's own offense against him with a submission move of his own.
""SmackDown"" Oct. 21

Street Fight Match: Randy Orton vs. Cody Rhodes - The final battle between the ex-Legacy members here as Cody came out with his baggers at ringside & the match made it's way to the floor in the opening moments with both men being thrown into the steps before taking the fight into the crowd with Cody eventually sacrificing his baggers just to get away from Orton. They brawled up the ramp to the isleway to the ring & back out to the announce tables with Cody targeting Orton's leg with a clip, stomps, and the figure four while also using his mask as a weapon various times. The was the final match in their feud against each other & definitely the best match in their series.
""SmackDown"" - Nov. 4
[Falls Count Anywhere]

Daniel Bryan vs. Mark Henry - This was a non-title match with Bryan having Big Show in his corner. Bryan went straight after Henry only for him to keep showcasing his advantage overpowering Bryan & even easily tossed him to the outside before squeezing his head between his bare hands & the ring post. The referee had to keep telling Big Show to stay back as he kept trying to help Bryan out through cheering or even coming over when he was in trouble causing Henry to back up. Bryan kept going to attempts at submissions like a reverse sleeper but Henry just kept using his power to his advantage to the point where he kept punishing Bryan in the corner with splashes. Honestly, this was a watchable match but only served the purpose of setting up the Big Show/Mark Henry rematch for Survivor Series as if you want to see the best singles match between these two, look for the steel cage match they had on SmackDown a few weeks later.
""SmackDown"" - Nov. 4
[Superstar Collection: Daniel Bryan]

C.M. Punk vs. Dolph Ziggler - A champion vs. champion match with Punk being the WWE Champion & Dolph holding the U.S. title.  Dolph started out in control while also doing his typical ""showing off"" including even being able to counter a GTS attempt into the sleeper which caused Punk to give Dolph a taste of his own medicine later on during a roll-up attempt.  This was a very competitive match between the two as they traded momentum & were able to block & kick out of each others signature moves throughout the match.
""RAW"" - Nov. 21

(Blu-Ray) Last Man Standing Match: World Champion Edge vs. Kane - This was their final encounter after their series of matches for the World Championship over the past few months with both men fighting around ringside to the backstage & lobby area area using whatever was around them & could get their hands on to their advantage including Kane attempting to do to Edge what he did to Paul Bearer as both men eventually fought back to the ring continuing to utilize anything within their reach to either make their signature offense more impactful or get back up before the count as it ultimate came down to one man being absolutely ruthless in their attack against their opponent to finally keep him down in a very physical encounter.
""SmackDown"" Jan. 7

(Blu-Ray) Randy Orton vs. Dolph Ziggler - Both men were challengers for their own brand's World Championships at the upcoming Royal Rumble as Orton was very methodical grounding Dolph & using his momentum against him while Dolph was fast paced focusing on an area of the body using whatever he could from wrestling to taking shortcuts in a solid match for their first ever meeting with the bigger story being the aftermath & everyone who got involved.
""RAW"" Jan. 17

(Blu-Ray) John Cena vs. C.M. Punk - All members of the New Nexus was banned from ringside or wouldn't be able to compete in the the Royal Rumble match as Cena went to the ground & pound focusing on the midsection area while Punk focused on the head of Cena utilizing offense from different positions of the ring with both men exchanging submissions & countering each other's offense at one point as both men would go on to have more memorable classic matches throughout the year but this was no different as they brought out the best in each other at this period of their career's but this was more about who decided to make his debut & an immediate impact.
""RAW"" Jan. 17

(Blu-Ray) Kane vs. Christian - The stipulation here was that Christian would get another World Championship match against Randy Orton if he wins this match as both men traded momentum with Christian attempting to keep Kane off his feet utilizing whatever possible from aerial offense to using the outside environment while Kane continued to dominate with his power including continuing to keep catching Christian in mid-offense before Mark Henry got involved & as a result costing Christian his title opportunity before turning into a tag match with Christian & Henry vs. Kane & Randy Orton with the same stipulation of Christian's title shot on the line in what turned out to be a solid ""tag wrestling 101"" tag match.
""SmackDown"" June 24

(Blu-Ray) No Count Out Match: Evan Bourne vs. Sin Cara - This was a RAW Roulette match that saw both men utilizing the fast paced lucha libre offense from a suicide dive to to a springboard twist to a moonsault with both men having their variations of a head scissors including one man landing face first as this was non-stop fast paced high flying action from start to finish.
""RAW"" June 27

(Blu-Ray) Tornado Tag Team Match: Rey Mysterio & Alex Riley vs. Miz & Jack Swagger - Another RAW Roulette match with all four men legal at the same time as both set of rivals faced off both in & outside of the ring with Mysterio & Riley being able to constantly take advantage of mistimings & using their opponents against each other while utlizing some impactful offense & double teaming while Miz & Swagger attempted to use the strategy of ""divide & conquer"" doing some double teaming of their own in a fun match.
""RAW"" June 27

With WWE deciding to release the recap of RAW & SmackDown together this year instead of their own separate releases, there wasn't much room for every single standout or relevant match on the show that year to be put on here but I think that some of the match selections (Kofi/Barrett, Bryan/Rhodes, Cara/Christian, Jackson/Rhodes, Henry/Christian, Bryan/Henry) could have been left out for more quality encounters such as Morrison/Bryan, one of the many battle royals from SmackDown or the RAW Royal Rumble, 12 man tag from SmackDown 600, Sin Cara/Bryan, Orton/Sheamus in a No DQ Match, Mysterio/Punk/Del Rio in a Falls Count Anywhere Match, Orton/Kane in a Street Fight Match, or Mysterio/Miz in WWE Title Tournament Final.  In the end, this is a good collection overall for fans of the 2011 year of WWE so I would check it out.",1347494400,4,24528,4.557272727272728
4892944,5,B005TZFZ2E,"Very good dvd, good matches, great moments could have been longer would have made it a little better but a great purchase none the less",1343692800,,135,4.44

4892946,5,B005TZFZ2E,What else would a 10 year old boy who is WWE crazy want. Just can't go wrong with this one.,1331424000,,91,3.6
4892947,4,B005TZFZ2E,"2011 was a pretty interesting year for WWE. Chris Jericho was gone so he could focus on Fozzy, Edge sadly retired, some newer stars like Daniel Bryan, Sin Cara, and Alberto Del Rio were coming into their own, while WWE dropped the ball with others despite fan demand. And of course, CM Punk was the new face of the company in spite of the higher ups. WWE did allow for some great match-ups though.

One negative about this release though is the lack of a Spanish audio track. I wanted one so I wouldn't have to listen to Ass-Cole's awful commentary.

The Matches

DISC 1: The Miz vs. John Morrison RAW Jan. 3

What a way to start the new year with a falls count anywhere match for the WWE championship. Again, Morrison showcased his great high flying and martial art abilities while Miz kept up with him well. Some notable parts include a crazy dive off the WWE logo and a sick Starship Pain through a table. Morrison looked strong even in defeat. It was unfortunate that he would end up leaving in 2012.

Dolph Ziggler vs. Kofi Kingston Smackdown Jan. 7

For the IC title. Kofi and Dolph have wrestled each other so many times, but it never gets boring. Dolph has one of the best looking dropkicks of recent memory, and Kofi's offense is always unique and innovative. There was almost a screwjob finish at the end, but thankfully the match ended on a good note.

Rey Mysterio vs. Alberto Del Rio Smackdown Jan. 7

Mysterio and Del Rio had several good matches, and this 2 out of 3 falls match was no exception. The chemistry was still there and it was very competitive. This is when Del Rio was more aggressive until stupid booking would make him more cowardly in the future. It's great to see how despite Mysterio's many injuries, he still manages to put on quality matches.

Natalya vs. Melina RAW Jan. 24

WWE continues to show disrespect for the women's division by only including one Diva's match in this set. Despite the short amount of time they were given, they managed to have a decent bout with Melina executing some great kicks and a unique submission move as well as Natalya showcasing her nice mat wrestling including a sharpshooter that folded Melina in half! Melina is also missed, but seeing how little the company thinks of the Diva's, maybe she's better off elsewhere.

The Miz vs. Daniel Bryan RAW Feb. 14

Despite the two having a great match-up, it was treated as a backdrop for Ass-Cole and Alex Riley to kiss up to Miz and bury Daniel Bryan. MUTE. The camera cut to the announcer's desk too much, but Bryan and Miz made the most of it with great mat wrestling. Bryan was very aggressive and hard hitting, and Miz delivered a scary neckbreaker to Bryan on the apron. Great American Dragon sign in the crowd!

Christian vs. Alberto Del Rio Smackdown March 18

A precursor to his title win, Christian got a chance to soften up Del Rio before Wrestlemania in a cage match. It was a fun bout and fast paced. I believe Christian's time in TNA wrestling the X-Division upped the ante of his already impressive skills, and showcased it with Del Rio.

Kofi Kingston vs. Wade Barret Smackdown March 25

A very good match for the Intercontinental title. Wade Barret is a big guy, but he does a great job of keeping up with Kofi's speed. Lots of great reversals and close calls made this match exciting. I didn't care too much for the post match beat-down though.

Blu-Ray: Edge vs. Kane Smackdown Jan 7

These guys had the worst feud of 2010, but this was a pretty cool match that thankfully wasn't bogged down with the stupidity of the previous year. They fought all over the building and it was a fun brawl. I wish Edge was still healthy enough to stay.

Blu-Ray: Randy Orton vs. Dolph Ziggler RAW Jan 17

This was their first time wrestling each other. Very fast paced and athletic. Dolph really took Orton to task and both pulled off some great moves out of nowhere. Unfortunately, they would have too many rematches that didn't portray Dolph as a serious threat.

Blu-Ray: John Cena vs. CM Punk RAW Jan 17

Before their famous WWE Championship bouts, we got this early gem where Punk got the most out of Cena. Instead of just breezing through the match like it was nothing, John Cena took this fight seriously as Punk forced him to chain wrestle and earn a victory. CM Punk used a variety of submission moves that Cena actually sold like they hurt. Every John Cena match should have him show this much effort. Mason Ryan also debuts.

DISC 2: John Cena vs. The Miz RAW May 2

It was a fast paced bout, and I liked it better than their Wrestlemania match until the end. I felt their Mania match felt shorter than it was, and The Rock's involvement took away the importance of it. This one on the other hand was fast action and Cena was continuing to treat his opponent seriously. The ending just sucked though. The referee reverses his decision despite not seeing Miz hit Cena with the title. (If the ref can do that here, why hasn't it been done in every other match that ends the same way?) A good match despite the ending.

Christian vs. Randy Orton Smackdown May 6 (Also on Randy Orton: Evolution of a Predator)

I, like many did not enjoy Christian losing the World Heavyweight Championship after 2 days and felt that WWE showed too much favoritism towards Orton, but enough of that. This was a great wrestling match and would lead to several other great matches between these two. The crowd was hot and there were just as many people who wanted Christian to win as there were with Orton. If Christian held the title for longer than a month, this feud would have been better.

Randy Orton vs. Sheamus Smackdown June 3

Christian was the ref. Sheamus and Orton also have some good interactions with each other. This was a very good combination of mat wrestling and brawling. Sheamus even showed a little bit of impressive agility. Thankfully, Christian being the ref didn't take away from the match and it only factored in afterwards. (Still don't know why he used his injured hand for the 3 count.)

John Cena, Randy Orton, and Alex Riley vs. Christian, R-Truth, and The Miz RAW June 20

This was after Capitol Punishment. After a silly interaction with the heels, we got a basic but cool match.

Daniel Bryan vs. Cody Rhodes Smackdown June 24

Who knew these 2 would have such great chemistry? I wish this feud was saved for Pay Per View. Cody showed that he could keep up with Bryan's technical wrestling, and they put on a pretty good clinic. Bryan even pulled off AJ Style's Pel Kick.

Christian vs. Sin Cara Smackdown July 1

I saw this episode live in Phoenix AZ, and this match was off the hook! Sin Cara gets a lot of flak from smart aleck fans because of his difficulty adjusting to the WWE style of putting on a match, but that's a bunch of nonsense. He has made mistakes in previous matches, but he and Christian were totally in tune with each other, and the former Mistico put in an amazing high flying performance while Christian's TNA knowledge paid off.

Blu-Ray: Kane vs. Christian Smackdown June 24

Normally, this match would only work if Kane was the villain and Christian hadn't turned yet, but surprisingly, Christian still took Kane to task and they had a nice back and forth encounter. Mark Henry interfered though, so this bout later changed to Christian and Henry vs. Kane and Randy Orton. A good tag match that was quick paced.

Blu-Ray: Evan Bourne vs. Sin Cara RAW June 27

This match was supposed to happen the week before as voted by fans, but due to an error in tallying up the votes, we had to wait. I'm thankful WWE felt like giving the fans what they wanted, and we got a cool match between the two high flyers. There's not too much that can be said other than how well their styles complimented each other as they flew and flipped all over the ring as Booker T would say: ""With the greatest of ease!""

Blu-Ray: Rey Mysterio and Alex Riley vs. The Miz and Jack Swagger RAW June 27

A pretty cool match where everyone put up a nice fight with each other. Mysterio and Riley made a good team.

DISC 3: Rey Mysterio vs. John Cena RAW July 25

Mysterio was WWE Champion for a little over an hour before losing it which annoyed me greatly. He and Cena did have a good match though that got pretty emotional as both were fighting with seemingly equal determination. Rey even put Cena in the STF. Rey easily could have figured into future matches with Cena and Punk for the title.

Ezekiel Jackson vs. Cody Rhodes Smackdown Aug 12

Pretty good showing for Jackson. His upper body strength slows him down a little bit, but Rhodes was able to put on a decent match with him. Jackson does have potential that hasn't been fully realized yet, and I'd like to see him improve.

John Morrison vs. R-Truth RAW Aug 15

This was Morrison's revenge for Truth costing him his World Championship win and for putting him out of action. A very cool bout that had both men utilize their environment and combine high flying, brawling, and an almost Jackie Chan-like use of props around them. The spot where Morrison suplexed Truth into a sitting position on an office chair before crashing into him with a lethal kick was fresh.

Alberto Del Rio vs. Daniel Bryan Smackdown Aug 19

Bryan was out to teach Del Rio a lesson for what he did to Punk and Mysterio. It was another good match between two technically sound professionals who absolutely should have more matches against each other. Their submission wrestling is very complimentary to each other.

David Otunga and Michael McGillicutty vs. Kofi Kingston and Evan Bourne RAW Aug 22

Otunga and Mr. Perfect's son did a pretty good job keeping up with the faster and more agile team. Lawler's commentary did undermine their efforts which led to a stupid storyline that was quickly dropped. A nice paced match where all four looked good.

Randy Orton vs. Chistian Smackdown Aug 30

This was part of Christian's ""One More Match Tour."" They wrestled in a cage, and it ranks right up there with their previous matches. They fought hard and put on a great show.

Randy Orton vs. Cody Rhodes Smackdown Sep 9

Like with Dolph Ziggler, Randy had what could have been a great series with Rhodes. This was pretty brutal for a TV match, and well fought. Just like with Dolph though, Orton won every time against Rhodes which does take a bit of the excitement away.

Dolph Ziggler vs. Zack Ryder RAW Sep 19

Hugh Jackman was host, and was in Ryder's corner. A pretty by-the-numbers match that was more about Vicki Guerrero trying to interfere and Jackman taking matters into his own hands.

Mark Henry vs. Christian Smackdown Sep 23

A heel vs. heel lumberjack match, but I'm assuming the crowd was on Henry's side. I'm not a big fan of lumberjack matches since the people on the outside take away from the main action. They proved to be ineffective though when Henry pushed them all back before throwing Trent Beretta into them. (And all but Khali fell back.)

CM Punk vs. Alberto Del Rio RAW Sep 26

While this was a good match, I felt it shouldn't have been given away before their PPV bouts so as to make it more special. They work fabulously together, and I certainly wouldn't mind more lengthy matches between the 2.

John Cena, CM Punk, Sheamus, Kofi Kingston, Evan Bourne, and Mason Ryan vs. Alberto Del Rio, Christian, Cody Rhodes, Dolph Ziggler, Jack Swagger, and David Otunga. RAW Oct 3

What a tremendous battle! I would love to have seen this on Survivor Series if it was possible. It was fast non-stop action from the start, and there was never a slow moment. Everybody got a chance to shine, and it was especially great to see face-offs between the wrestlers who haven't had single matches with each other yet.

John Cena vs. Sheamus RAW Oct 10

Not much of a match. They barely touch each other before Vince McMahon interrupts making this a waste of space on the disc. CM Punk didn't even get to settle into calling the whole show by himself.

Sin Cara (Azul) vs. Sin Cara (Negro) Smackdown Oct 21

Hunico, who played Mistco in CMLL made his debut as the evil Sin Cara a while back before the original would return and retake his mantle. Sin Cara and Hunico had a great match that was more crisp then their bout at Hell in a Cell. Lots of acrobatics with the two trying to one-up each other. The excited crowd in Mexico made this feel even more special. It was especially great to see Sin Cara finally use his Mistco finisher, La Mistca.

Randy Orton vs. Cody Rhodes Smackdown Nov 4

Again, this would have meant more if Orton wasn't winning every match. But aside from WWE trying to make Orton's matches predictable, they had a fun, hard hitting street fight.

Mark Henry vs. Daniel Bryan Smackdown Nov 4

Not their best confrontation with each other. Bryan put up a good fight, but he ended up getting overshadowed by Big Show wanting a piece of Henry.

CM Punk vs. Dolph Ziggler RAW Nov 21

Another great athletic contest. Very precise with Punk and Dolph constantly reminding the audience why they earned the right to be among the top stars in the company. Ziggler would have fit with Ring of Honor.

All in all, there were some great matches with only a minority of them not being so great. I was glad that Sin Cara's best showings were included as to remind people he's worth investing in. I certainly would have liked to see matches featuring Justin Gabriel, Tyson Kidd, Yoshi Tatsu, Drew McIntyre, and especially more Diva matches since Gail Kim, Eve Torres, Natalya, Beth Phoenix, AJ, and Kaitlyn have had some great overlooked matches with each other.

It was also good to see the great promo work included, especially CM Punk's excellent rant where he had the guts to bring up everything that millions of people at home have been upset with as well as Edge's heartfelt farewell. I do wish the contract signing between Punk and Cena was included though.

I do hope that 2012 continues to bring us more great matches from RAW and Smackdown that will find their way to the next ""Best of"" set.",1331251200,,13989,4.53060413354531
4892948,5,B005TZFZ2E,"It was a year that saw an 'Awesome' title reign, the return of 'The Great One', an shocking retirement and many, many memorable moments and matches that made both Raw and Smackdown must watch TV.

Disc 1

-1/3/11, Raw, Falls Count Anywhere Match for the WWE Championship, The Miz (Champion) w/Alex Riley vs. John Morrison: The former tag champs and best friends face off for the biggest prize of them all and it was quite a good match as both guys were on a roll coming into this contest. Morrison was on fire early taking it to both guys and even hitting a splash off the WWE logo on the stage onto both guys and he kept up the offense back in the ring almost having Miz beat, but Riley inteferes and gets beat up again.

Back from the break Del Rio takes it to Rey who comes back with a springboard hurricarana, Del Rio later goes for the arm breaker but Rey reverses into a pin for two, then a Mahistrol Cradle for 3 and its 1-1. The third fall is quite good ad both men turn up the heat and go all out, Rey hits a splash to the outside on both Alberto and Ricardo, Rey rolled Del Rio into the ring, Ricardo prevents Rey from coming back in and his is counted out so Alberto wins. 7/10.

Now that he's back in charge that they will have a World Title match right now and Edge comes out.

We get a good promo from JBL as he talks up Wrestlemania and slams the fans like only he can, of course Austin's music hits and the crowd gives a big reaction. He faces off with both men and hits the Stunner on JBL, drinks a few beers then Austin signs the contract as Cole looks on in horror. Good segment.

-3/14/11, Raw, ""The Rock"" Attacks John Cena?: We see the final minute of Alberto Del Rio vs. John Cena, Brodus Clay attacks Cena and the ref calls for the DQ. The Rock's music hits and he appears, by he I mean The Miz dressed as The Rock and he comes to the ring and hits Cena with a Rock Bottom and all three guys beat Cena.

Nice segment.

-3/18/11, Smackdown, Steel Cage Match, Christian vs. Alberto Del Rio: Just a couple of weeks before Del Rio faced Edge at Wrestlemania he faced his best friend Christian in a 15 foot high steel cage. Christian came out full of fire as Alberto has put him out of action for months with a pec injury, Del Rio hit a big Samoan Drop off of the top rope and both men are down. Christian goes head first into the cage and Alberto targets the injury with a sleeper hold, Christian comes back hitting a reverse DDT but only for two.

This was a great moment that really built up the hype for the upcoming Wrestlemania match.

Disc 1 Blu-Ray Exclusives

-1/7/11, Smackdowwn, Last Man Standing Match for the World Heavyweight Championship, Edge (Champion) vs. Kane: Very good hard hitting matchup where Kane tried to regain his title after losing it at TLC in December. Kane uses his power while Edge holds his own and uses some quickness to try to keep the big red monster down, they battle into the entrance way and backstage area where Kane slams Edge into a drinking fountain and then back into the crowd and into the concessions area. Nice spot where Kane puts Edge into a wheelchair and looks to do to Edge what he did to Paul Bearer but Edge avoids going down the stairs. They fight back to the ring, Edge uses a chair to target Kane's knee to keep him down, even using a con-chair-to which finally keeps Kane off his feet for the 10 count. 9/10.

Disc 2

-4/15/11, Smackdown, Edge Says Goodbye: After winning his final match at Wrestlemania, Edge was forced to retire due to a neck injury and he gave a very heartfelt goodbye speech to the fans which was easily one of the best segments of the year. Very emotional and honestly just sad that Edge was forced to retire as he was still at the top of his game at this point.

-4/25/11, Raw, A New Side of R-Truth: Great heel promo here by Truth as he had the crowd hating him but was so entertaining it was impossible for me to hate him. This started his best run in wrestling as he played a great heel to the hilt.

-5/2/11, Raw, WWE Championship Match, John Cena (Champion) vs. The Miz w/Alex Riley: Right after winning the WWE title at Extreme Rules, The Miz gets his rematch and its a good contest.

Christian comes back and takes it to Randy but can't keep him down for three, even after a high crossbody and a diving reverse elbow.

-5/23/11, Raw, Riley's Revenge: The night after losing an I Quit Match at Over The Limit, Miz and Alex Riley come to the ring and Miz proceeds to run down his apprentice blaming him for his recent losses. He then asks the anonymous Raw GM for another match but he is denied and he rips Riley some more, shoves him and slaps him which angers and he takes it to Miz slamming him into the barricade and punches him down in the ring which got a good reaction intially from the crowd. Good segment.

-6/3/11, Smackdown, World Heavyweight Championship Match, Randy Orton (Champion) vs. Sheamus, Special Guest Referee, Christian: There was some tension between Orton and Christian given their recent matches in May, both men took it to the other in and out of the ring with Sheamus using his strength edge. Orton also got some good shots in, including a big superplex off the top rope, then Sheamus hits a big shoulder block but only for two. Later Sheamus counters the RKO and goes for the High Cross but Randy counters and Sheamus accidentaly hits Christian which leads to him not counting three, then after an RKO Ortona covers and wins. 7/10. Christian then blasts Randy in the head with the title and stands over him holding it.

-6/20/11, Raw, 6-Man Tag Team Elimination Match, John Cena, Randy Orton & Alex Riley vs. Christian, R-Truth & The Miz: Before the match we have another R-Truth promo where he blames ""Little Jimmy"" for losing to John Cena at Capitol Punishment, then Christian's music hits and he talks about how he also got screwed at the PPV. Then Miz comes down and talks about how he also got screwed in his match with Alex Riley, which led to a great spat between all three. Tedd Long's music hit and he is able to make a match hence the following contest.

The match itself is good as the pace doesn't really slow down, Cena and Miz face off then Orton takes it to Miz hitting a big clothesline out of the corner. Once Christian gets in he works over Randy for a bit before tagging R-Truth who does a good job keeping him in his team's corner. Christian comes back in and goes for the Spear but gets hit with a scoop slam, then Randy tags Riley who hits Christian with big clotheslines and a slam, then gets blindsided by the Miz who hits the Skull Crushing Finale, Christian covers and Riley is gone.

Christian celebrates but gets an RKO then the STF from Cena and Christian taps out. 8/10.

-6/24/11, Smackdown, Daniel Bryan vs. Cody Rhodes: Good heel promo from Cody as he slams the fans like only he does and sadly a bland promo from Bryan (great wrestler, lousy mic skills), though a funny moment where he talks about Cody's dad Dusty Rhodes. Not a bad match starts out with good mat wrestling and some snap arms drags by Daniel, Ted DiBiase comes to ringside to be in Rhodes corner and he gets a couple of cheap shots in on Bryan. Cody targets Daniel's neck and head, using the mask as a weapon with a couple of headbutts, Bryan comes back with some hard kicks, DiBiase interferes and gets a suicide dive for his troubles. Cody ends up hitting the Beautiful Disaster Kick then Cross Rhodes and covers to win. 7/10. Afterwards Cody puts a paper bag on Daniel's head.

-6/27/11, Raw, CM Punk Speaks His Mind: Punk interferes in a Tables Match causing Truth to put Cena through the table and win, then he unleashes a verbal tirade on Cena, Vince and the entire WWE. It ends with the mic being cut off which angers Punk and the fans. Great promo.

-7/1/11, Smackdown, Christian vs. Sin Cara: There's the bad blue/orange lighting throughout the match, that being said its not a bad match, Christian takes it to Cara while the high flyer hits his usual hig impact moves and stiff kicks, but Christian launches him over the top to the floor then wears him down keeping him grounded but misses a diving headbutt. Cara hits some quick moves but ends up getting hit with the spear and Christian covers to win. 5/10.

-7/18/11, Raw, Mr. McMahon Is Relieved of His Duties: After losing at Money In The Bank and CM Punk left with the WWE Title, Vince McMahon says no one man is bigger than the WWE and he calls out John Cena to fire him. Cena proceeds to profess how much he loves the WWE and that he wouldn't allow Vince to do to him what he did to Shawn Michaels in Montreal in '97. He says that he will not kiss Vince's you know what, but Vince goes to tell him he's fired then Triple H's music hits. Trips tells him in no certain words that he is relieved of his on air duties, which brings Vince to tears. Good segment.

Disc 2 Blu-Ray Exclusives

-4/4/11, Raw, Save The Date: The Rock vs. John Cena: The night after The Rock cost John Cena the title at Wrestlemania they have another face off where they agree to face each other at Wrestlemania 28. Then for no reason The Corre comes to the ring and Cena and Rock fight them off.

-6/24/11, Smackdown, Kane vs. Christian: Power vs. Speed as Kane dominates the smaller man early on before Christian gets the big man off his feet and keeps him down with a sleeper hold and slams him into the barricade. Kane hits a sideslam, then takes over with a one armed slam, then they trade back and forth moves with Christian hitting a jumping DDT for two. Later Kane hits a hugh diving clothesline and goes for the win but Mark Henry interferes causing a DQ. 7/10. Teddy Long comes out and makes a tag team match due to the interference.

-6/24/11, Smackdown, Kane & Randy Orton vs. Christian & Mark Henry: Its not a bad tag match, Mark wears down Orton while Christian does his best to beat the Viper. Once Kane is tagged he hammers Henry and hits the diving clothesline but Mark kicks out, then Kane tries to slam him but his back gives out and Christian takes over working on the back.

Both went all out, Rey kept using his quick offense while Cena brough his A-game and didn't phone it in.

John Cena, Sheamus and CM Punk come out to show their support and then this match is made. Its more of a segment than a match as soon after it begins Vince McMahon's music hits and he tells Triple H that because of the dangerous workplace that Raw has become that he is being relieved of being in charge of Raw. A new GM is introduced and that is John Laurenitis, which gets a massive chorus of boos.

-10/21/11, Smackdown, Mask vs. Mask Match, Sin Cara Azul vs. Sin Cara Negro: From Mexico City we have a rarity on WWE TV as both masked men put their masks on the line to settle this feud. Its a good match mind you but that stupid blue and orange light really takes away from it, but that being said Cara Azul hits a big splash to the outside onto Cara Negro. Back from break Cara Negro works on the back, locking on a camel clutch and various submission moves. A series of close nearfalls occur shortly after with neither man staying down for three, Azul hits a head scissors into an arm bar and Negro taps out. 5/10, mainly for the lighting.

-11/21/11, Raw, Champion vs. Champion Match, CM Punk vs. Dolph Ziggler: Good match here, better than their Royal Rumble match a couple of months later.
