8563606,5,B00B7EQVNI,"The Private Life of a Masterpiece: Masterpieces 1800 to 1850 looks at three works: Goyas The Third of May, 1808, Delacroixs Liberty Leading the People and Hokusais print, The Great Wave.  As with other discs in the series, Samuel West narrates and multiple art historians comment on the works in question, setting them in their historical and aesthetic contexts.

The first two paintings on this disc are fascinating and so too are their historical settings.  The Delacroix is particularly interesting because the image has stirred the hearts of latter-day revolutionists and the image has transmuted across popular culture, being used by cartoonists, satirists and other serious artists.  The Hokusai print is also an enormously popular image.  A friend of mine, e.g., had it painted on the external wall of his townhouse in Georgetown.  (The actual print is very small in size, particularly compared with the gigantic Goya and Delacroix paintings.  The Delacroix, e.g., consists of three large canvases that were sewn together.)  The Great Waves historical setting is more aesthetic and cultural than political.  It emerges from a certain style of contemporary printmaking and it was actually one of a boxed set of images of Mt. Fuji.

I love this series, at least the two discs that I have now viewed.  Anyone interested in the history of art and the contexts in which masterpieces have found their place, meaning and importance will enjoy this disc.  Note that each discussion is about 45 minutes long, a convenient length for bingeing or shorter studies.  The commentaries are generally very interesting and presented in terms that general viewers will understand and appreciate.",1500422400,,1684,5.215613382899628
