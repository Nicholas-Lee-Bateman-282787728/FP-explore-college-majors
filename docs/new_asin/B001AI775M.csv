8277578,5,B001AI775M,This is one of the best sitcoms I have ever seen. It is too bad that they do not make shows like this anymore. I recommend buying this series to anyone that is looking for a great sitcom. I like the play all feature which means you can watch the whole CD at once.,1244678400,,263,3.888888888888889

Comes neatly packed in very good quality CD cases. I quite like the way the Seasons 6 and 7 CDs are packed in each of the cases. Very good picture quality that makes sure you get to fully enjoy the whole Series, especially the breathtaking opening of the episodes (Seasons 1-3) when the plane is flying over the ocean, as well as the closing. Brings back excellent memories! As for the Series itself; well WINGS takes you, and keeps you, up there. It seems to me it will have no difficulty staying forever at the top with the best of TV comedies.",1240012800,,700,5.422018348623853
8277580,5,B001AI775M,"I love this series and that's why I gave it 5 stars, althought I didn't catch it when it was originally on. I caught up with reruns, so I bought the 7-season set, thinking this was all of them. Then I find out later that there was an 8th season. So I am in agreement with another reviewer that why would you offer a boxed 7-season set when there is still another to come. And now I find out the 8-season set is only $2 more than the 7-season set but I will have to pay $28 more just to get the final season versus had I waited for all 8. Not happy! The show has been off the air for 12 years. Why does it take so long to get these on DVD? Would it be to drag it out and make more money!?",1235088000,,687,3.7448275862068967
8277581,1,B001AI775M,Why would they release a set of seasons 1-7 when 8 is yet to come out?? Wouldnt it make more sense to just wait until they are all done and put out a nice COMPLETE SERIES boxset?!?! weirdddddd,1225584000,2,192,4.078947368421052
8277582,3,B001AI775M,"If you're a fan of this sit-com, you won't be disappointed. The only thing I didn't like was the quality of the video. I watched the first season on my 48"" RPTV and the picture was not very good, which is why I'm giving this set 3 stars. I'm used to watching alot of HDTV, so maybe that's why it looks the way it does. Nevertheless, it's a great show.",1223683200,2,351,4.0285714285714285
