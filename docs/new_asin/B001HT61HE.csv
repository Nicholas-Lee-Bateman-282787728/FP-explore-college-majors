8309537,3,B001HT61HE,"A Woman's Rage follows an obsessed woman's plan of vengeance against the woman who she tells anyone who will listen, seduced her boyfriend and took what was hers. After the plans of stalking him when he dines with clients, and showing up at his house and letting herself in don't result in him taking her back she decides to murder his sister and then him.  She then pretends to be the sister and manipulate herself into her ex's fiancee's life so she can make the woman feel exactly what she does, when she takes away the man most important to her, the woman's son.

It's a watchable movie, the actors do what they can with a fairly weak and predictable script but sometimes it comes across as overacting. This is your usual made for TV budget movie plot, where a woman blames another woman for the fact her ex doesnt love her/broke up with her/thinks shes a nutjob film.  Cynthia Preston dies her hair back to the colour you see her in most films, after a bit of murdering. I found it hard to believe that the fiancee would never have met, let alone ever spoken to the sister or at the very least at least seen a picture of her, even if she did live in a different city. I guess the insane mind of the ex might have made her believe that or was something she never even thought about, but I doubt anyone would seriously consider that as a plan.

Still you find this DVD in the budget section of stores so for a couple of dollars at most, it'll pass an hour and a half of your time well enough.",1448150400,,1495,4.253521126760563
8309538,3,B001HT61HE,"This movie wasen't bad, but too typical for my taste. Your basic lover's revenage type of film.  The plot is very familiar:  A woman falls in love with a man, but soon he decides that their relationship isen't working out for him.  The woman dosen't want to accept this, since she believes that this man was and still is her true love, at least in her mind.  She then, rather predictably, seeks revenge, meaning that anyone and everyone who may get in her way will be ruthlessly killed.  Like I wrote its nothing new, but isen't done in a bad way either.  So if you don't mind spending some 90 minutes watching this, then it won't be a mistake to check it out.",1235520000,,660,4.32520325203252
