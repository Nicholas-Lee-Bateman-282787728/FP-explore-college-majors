4620942,5,B0059XTU7W,"Being familiar  with  the  Mighty Macs when  they  were playing,  I  was  anxious  to  see  the  movie.  It  brought  back  memories  of  how  this little  school  defied  the odds  and  ""won  it all"". My  grandchildren  all  saw  the  movie  and  felt  it  was  one  of  the  best movies  they  ever  saw. Looking  forward  to  purchasing  multiple  copies.",1327881600,5,358,4.491228070175438
4620943,5,B0059XTU7W,"""It will take an act of God to save this school."" Cathy Rush (Gugino)is a modern woman in the '70's. Her husband is not working and rather then staying home she decided to go out and get a job coaching at a local all girls catholic school. With no gym, uniforms, a school about to close and a lack of talent she does her best to make the team better then it ever thought it could. I should tell you right off that I am a sucker for sports movies. I will watch pretty much any movie about sports. Most of the sports movies that come out lately are true stories and to me that makes them better. This one is about a small catholic girls school that went from no gym to trying to win the national championship. Not only is this inspiring but it really makes you feel for what the girls had to go through to get there. This is one of the better sports movies I have seen and I highly recommend this to everyone...not just girls. Overall, a great family movie that any parent with a high school girl who is unsure of herself should watch. I give it an A.",1325635200,11,1049,4.097087378640777
4620944,5,B0059XTU7W,"EXCELLENT MOVIE!!!!  I remember when girls still had to play w/6 players - 3 on offense, 3 on defense and each could not cross the center line.  This was well before Title IX; before girls had as many opportunities in sports as they do now.  This movie takes place the year after the 6/6 rule was changed to the current system of full court play w/5 players.  Ladies, remember those who came before you to get what you have now.  For those who come from (past or present) the Philadelphia area, this movie takes place in the (then) small girls Catholic school of Immaculta  College - just outside of Philly.  Look for cameos by real Cathy Rush and Ed Rush.  Also one of the nuns is actually an original player from the Championship Years of 1972-1974. Remember to stay after the movie is over, because it tells you how the players are doing now.  GET IT ON DVD.",1325289600,20,861,4.39873417721519
4620945,5,B0059XTU7W,"I am glad they finally told the story of this little school that won the National Championship.
The movie is well written with excellent acting. A very good ""feel good"" movie.",1324512000,6,175,4.67741935483871
4620946,5,B0059XTU7W,"Great movie for everyone especially for those girls who love the game. The movie chronicles the emergence of women's basketball in America. Its an uplifting story of the vaunted Mighty Macs of Immaculata College from little Catholic college to national basketball power. Its about believing in yourself, your coach and your teammates and illustrates the power of a team to do the impossible. The All American center went on to coach Rutgers to a national championship herself and her players went on to other championships at other schools - all from the Mighty Macs.

If you have a liitle girl who wants to play ball show her this film.",1323907200,32,637,4.844036697247707
4620947,5,B0059XTU7W,"This review is based on seeing the movie in the theater when it was out (only for 1 week and only very limited distribution, unfortunately).  It is a very entertaining, uplifting film.  Set in a Catholic College, the film has some religious content and values, but is not preachy.  I did not have the sense of an underlying religious message.  Rather, it is a sports film following the somewhat predictable formula of underdog triumphing but with enough quirky turns to hold my interest.  The overall result is similar in many ways to ""Rudy"".  If you liked ""Rudy"", you will probably enjoy this movie as well. I am on the list for notification when the DVD is available and plan to purchase it.",1321574400,58,693,4.639344262295082
4620948,5,B0059XTU7W,"This movie was one of the best movies I have ever seen. Well at least in a long time. Saw in a movie theater. And it was only showing in one theater for one showing every other day for the week. What a shame. A family movie like that should have been more exposed. I love this movie that much that when it is available to purchase, I will buy it and it will be a part of my movie collection.",1321401600,34,391,3.8395061728395063

4621227,5,B0059XTU7W,"The Mighty Macs is a sports film that stars Carla Gugino as Cathy Rush, a Hall of Fame women's basketball coach who leads Immaculata College to a national championship in women's basketball during the 70's. Ellen Burstyn,Marley Shelton and David Boreanaz co-stars. It was written and directed by Tim Chambers.

The screenplay is based on the incredible true story of the 1971-72 Immaculata College women's basketball team that started from obscurity and win the national championship when Cathy Rush takes a job as the head women's basketball college coach. It tells the story of their training,their struggles and their victory during their first year. Later,the school became a dynasty by winning three straight national championships from 1972 to 1974.

It could be classified as generic considering that one won't find anything really refreshing in the movie. Added to that,we get to see some familiar themes and clichs like overcoming the odds,the familiar underdog story and many more. But Gugino gives an good performance that definitely would provide interest in the Mighty Macs' journey to the national victory and her journey as well as a first year coach. As for the action on the court,there is nothing really spectacular except that one would really enjoy the hard work,dedication and determination to overcome the odds they Mighty Macs are facing. Overall,it does not really fall short in entertainment especially for sports fans who love underdog stories. Definitely,a family film.",1446422400,,1496,5.30801687763713

4621763,5,B0059XTU7W,"I went to see this movie when it came out in the theaters for two reasons. First, I remember reading about the Immaculata women's basketball championships in the early to mid-1970s before Title IX ensured that women's basketball would become part of the big-time college sports scene. (At the time I was teaching at the University of Nebraska and men's basketball was the only game in town.) Second, and more importantly, my wife had gone to Immaculata 1968-1970 and wanted to see the movie. Plus, having married a girl from the Philadelphia area, I had been out there on a number of occasions and figured some of the scenes might be familiar.

What I saw was a movie that was far better than anything I had expected. This true story of a coach with little experience, girls with limited natural ability but a true desire to win, and facilities that even back then, some forty years ago, were definitely subpar, is in every way uplifting and inspirational. It was during these early years of the five-on-five full court game that girls showed that they could play in a way that was as competitive and exciting as their male counterparts. Schools like Immaculata (and some of the other small colleges that were at the forefront of the women's game back then) have been eclipsed by the top-rate programs at many universities today, but they deserve recognition for all that they did for the game. This is a movie well worth watching.",1384732800,,1431,4.724
4621764,5,B0059XTU7W,A truly inspirational and motivational DVD! Great and wholesome entertainment for the whole family. Two thumbs up - do not miss this!,1383696000,,133,5.090909090909091
4621765,5,B0059XTU7W,"This movie is like the female version of ""Hoosiers,"" even opening with a similar retro montage where a basketball coach (Carla Gugino) drives to her new school through the countryside, this time a college in Pennsylvania rather than a high school in Indiana. Like ""Hoosiers,"" it's based on the true story of an unlikely basketball championship, this time a 1970s basketball team at a small Catholic women's college in Pennsylvania. It even features the same underlying theme of religion (this time Catholicism rather than Protestantism) as it relates to basketball as a metaphor for life. Knowing this much about the film and having seen the trailer, I was not really expecting much from it, but I was pleasantly surprised to find it highly entertaining. While it may not match ""Hoosiers"" in the emotional depth of its performances, as it lacks the touching triangle of broken lives (Gene Hackman, Barbara Hershey, and Dennis Hopper) of that 1986 gem, ""The Mighty Macs"" is refreshing in bringing a lighter touch to this genre. Above all, it works because it treats basketball as a game, not as a pseudo-religious substitute for the divine. Therefore it's a more lighthearted alternative to ""Hoosiers"" and ""Hoop Dreams,"" but it likewise avoids the cliched melodrama and buffoonish comedy of sports films like Disney's ""Glory Road."" Carla Gugino makes it work, giving an understated and insistently sincere performance as a Baptist basketball coach hired to coach girls at a small Catholic college in danger of bankruptcy. There are cliched themes, of course, like the independent woman trying to make it in the 1970s and the misfit players learning to work together as a team. But it works because of the good will of the performers to tell this story. Rather than being a schlock production by Disney or some other major studio, this one was produced independently, and it shows in the genuineness of human interactions in the film between the players and among the adults featured. If this inspirational film is ultimately a tad lightweight, perhaps that's because it is reminding us that sports like basketball are ultimately just games, not substitutes or metaphors for real relationships and careers as many people in our society have come to believe. In that sense, I loved this movie, and I think others -- both male and female -- will enjoy it as well if they are open to the idea that sports films based on true stories do not need to imbue their stories with life-or-death implications. This film reminds us that the games we learned in childhood, no matter how much we have come to idolize them as moneymakers, are ultimately for enjoyment rather than profit. Sometimes a game is just a game.",1383696000,,2702,4.953744493392071

4622049,5,B0059XTU7W,"One of the best movies of the year! Great inspirational movie. True story and well done, down to the scores of the games and how the teams got there.

The movie tells the true story of Cathy Rush and the Immaculata girls basketball team. Make sure you check her incredible story online and then watch the movie. The best scenario is written by life. No need to imagine and make things up. She had tremendous courage for that time (1972) and she is pushing everybody to their limits. If she was using the same methods today with all the idiotic parents who want to be their kid's friend instead of parenting, and who want to give trophies to everybody just for participation, she should have been out of a job and probably sued by some low life lawyer.

There are several extras on the DVD that are very interesting. The ESPN production is fabulous and shows the real team in 1972. The interviews with the cast are also great. But the real interesting things on the DVD are the three deleted scenes. I definitely think that they should have included at least two of the scenes in the movie to remind some people (and to show the younger generation) how women were treated just 40 years ago in the so called civilized world. Maybe the producers cut the scenes because didn't want to hurt people feelings. But maybe they didn't put these scenes in because didn't want to distract from the real subject which is the unbelievable courage and tenacity of Cathy Rush in a time where she was supposed to stay home, cook for her husband, and take care of the kids.

Five stars all around for the magnificent story of a woman who changed our civilization forever!",1357084800,3,1653,4.521739130434782

4622118,5,B0059XTU7W,"As a man, I also like sports films - one of my favorites is We Are Marshall.  Others I liked were Hoosiers and Remember the Titans.

One month ago, I picked up The Mighty Macs as a previously viewed DVD.  The Mighty Macs was one film I really wanted to see, since Tim Chambers had been interviewed on Catholic Radio and EWTN's Life on the Rock devoted a whole show to The Mighty Macs.  I'm also familiar with Immaculata College (now Immaculata University) because I often visit Philadelphia.  One high school mentioned in the film (Villa Maria) is still open and is not far away in Malvern.  I did not know that Immaculata was an all-girls school until recently.  I do know a good priest who has served in recent years as the Chaplain to the Campus Ministry.

However,  I didn't get to see The Mighty Macs in the theatre (part of it was the limited release - it only played at the dollar cinema here for a week), so I was glad I got to see it on DVD. Like the other reviewers, I found the extras, particularly the ESPN documentary, to be interesting, as well as the makings of the film.

The Mighty Macs was made in 2009, and it took a long time for Tim Chambers to find a distributor.  I'm glad Tim Chambers ""stuck to his guns"" and refused to ""water down"" this story. Mr. Chambers started researching this story in 2004.  It was a great film - I've watched it twice.  I liked the story, and as one reviewer mentioned, this was before Title IX.

The Mighty Macs was a very positive film, not only about basketball but about the players.  I liked how the ladies were shown as ""real"" people. None of them seemed ""cliquish"", and it was refreshing to see a film with actresses who were not ""bleached blondes"", 5'-10"" and a size 4. All were bright students, and each character had her struggles.  It was great to see ""the girls next door"" on film.  I also enjoyed the scene where the girls pitched in and lent one girl a dress and heels for their group photo.

Another thing too that came in the DVD extras was that each actress during her audition was ""graded"" on her ability to play basketball. During shooting, the girls played quite a bit of basketball. One actress in the film even played basketball at a college in Florida.  Had a mainstream Hollywood studio made this film, The Mighty Macs would have been less believable - Tim Chambers did a great job.",1351814400,,2355,4.38479262672811
4622119,5,B0059XTU7W,"I had never even heard of this movie, and I read almost everything dealing with entertainment. I watched it on Netflix the other night and was so sad that this movie didn't get more press and exposure. This movie was great. First of all, I have to say that Carla Gugino has to be the most under-recognized and under appreciated actress of her generation. It's not easy to pull off the role of a no nonsense coach without some serious training. It's an attitude, a way of walking, and talking. It's about talking with precision and authority. I am constantly amazed at her ability to tackle one role to the next, with no similarities whatsoever, and completely owning every role. I felt like I was watching one of my old coaches from high school who had 20 plus years of experience getting something out of kids. What a talented woman. This movie is about creating something from nothing, and singularly focusing on achieving something when no one thought it could be possible. There's no foul language, obscenities, anything but heartfelt joy at watching a group of players come together to achieve something extraordinary. And sometimes that in itself is refreshing, since we are surrounded by extreme violence and graphic sexuality at every turn. This movie is for people of all ages, providing a little hope in a world where there doesn't seem to be much. A would call this an hour and a half well spent.",1349222400,,1407,4.723577235772358
4622120,5,B0059XTU7W,"The journey from production to the big screen for ""The Mighty Macs"" was a tortuous one.  My father worked for the Archdiocese of Philadelphia who offered assistance to the film while they were making it a few years ago.  The film had a hard time getting a distributor.  It finally came out last Fall in the wake of ""Moneyball"" another film about a sports team with little financial resources who rise to the top.  ""Moneyball"" had a bankable star in Brad Pitt as a selling point.  ""The Mighty Macs"" pretty much disappeared in limited release.  It's a shame because it's an excellent film.  Ostensibly the film chronicles the first year of a run of three consecutive NCAA titles for the tiny Immaculata College's women's basketball team in the early Seventies.  Really the film is about what it means to be a winner.  What the film stresses is that winning is a group effort that can't be done alone.  Yes, Coach Cathy Rush (Carla Gugino) can philosophize the intracacies of playing together but that is reciprocated by her players who teach Rush a few things about the facts of life.  The coach and players are assisted in their journey by the assistant coach, Sister Sunday(Marley Shelton), who may be young but not unwise to the potholes in life.  They are also inspired by the humility and self-sacrifice of the Immaculate Heart Sisters led by their Mother Superior played by Ellen Burstyn who administer the beseiged college.  I'm sure there are some embellishments but most of the events portrayed in the film are true.  If you're looking for exciting game footage this is the film for you.  If you're looking for a testament to human faith you found it.  Judging from the overwhelmingly positive reaction to the film from those who've seen ""The Mighty Macs"" this is the one that got away.",1348790400,3,1793,4.735483870967742

There's lots of good news here. First, if you have Netflix, it's free. If not, pay whatever it costs to rent. Maybe even consider buying it because you will want to watch it again and again.

I am very picky when it comes to movies. If they aren't 4 stars, they better be pretty close or else I don't want to watch it. Mighty Macs is a movie that you alone or with family will love. To make it even better, it is based on a true story.

Mighty Macs is Hoosiers for girls. It's a true story of how a born-to-be basketball coach, finds a desperate girls school in need of everything, and pulls up everyone's bootstraps to victory. The movie is filled with inspiration, excitement, drama and love.

I don't want to bore with yet another review that goes into great detail about the plot and characters. Others have done it here, probably better than me.

4622226,5,B0059XTU7W,"- The Mother Superior, during her first face-to-face meeting with Cathy Rush: ""This is our last ball. Please, uh, don't lose it.""

Maybe you'll raise an eyebrow or nudge an elbow when you hear talk of Immaculata College, once an all-women Catholic school, being compared to John Wooden's UCLA dynasty, but, no, it's not balderdash, it's not whistling in the dark. THE MIGHTY MACS tells the remarkable true story of Cathy Rush (Carla Gugino) who, as a woman in her early twenties and with no coaching experience, in 1972 became the head coach of Immaculata's struggling women's basketball team, and never mind that she was the only one to have applied for the position. And in Immaculata, nestled just a bit outside of Philadelphia, is where Cathy Rush made her mark. By the time she was done, Immaculata College was regarded as the birthplace of modern women's basketball. Moments after I saw this flick, I was on the Google, wanting to know more. I was that hooked.

Recognize that the 1970s presented an era in which women were still expected to be stay-at-home wives while the menfolk brought home the bacon, meaning that Cathy Rush was a pioneer in more ways than one. The state of affairs at Immaculata upon her arrival was straight up horrible. Immaculata's basketball program touted no scholarships, no budget, had no uniforms. The gym had burned down some time ago. THE MIGHTY MACS sets up a perfect underdog scenario. And since it's rated G, this really is for the entire family to savor, especially if you have young girls in the household. It's well-executed drama and hits all the right notes. In terms of heart and a knack for rapidly generating that rooting interest, THE MIGHTY MACS is right up there with HOOSIERS. Nostalgia drips from this relevant time capsule.

Carla Gugino can never be on the screen enough. She's so dang beautiful it tends to overshadow the fact that she can act. She's so strong here as Cathy Rush. She captures the coach's relentless personality and her gumption and her flair. I really like those scenes in which she implements her training techniques and attempts to impart life lessons on her doubting players. The film also touches on Cathy's sometimes rocky personal life. David Boreanaz's part as NBA ref and Cathy's hubbie, Ed Rush, is more a supporting one, but Boreanaz is good and ably conveys the mindset of the macho male of that era. Still, you sense that his resistance to Cathy's taking on a job will eventually wilt. Marley Shelton, whom I initially assumed was Amy Acker (from ANGEL), is captivating as the gamine but feisty coach's assistant Sister Sunday. And, as ever, Ellen Burstyn's presence can't help but class up a production even more. Burstyn plays the severe, fretful Mother Superior, at her wits' end over Immaculata's terrible financial plight. She has no idea salvation would come from a marginalized women's sport.

Women's basketball showcases skill and precise execution over rampant athleticism. The oncourt sequences emphasize the philosophy of teamwork, of timely passing and scrappy defense. I found myself enjoying the basketball scenes as much as the acting moments. The girls of the Mighty Macs look convincing on the court, never mind that their uniform comprises an ungainly tunic and a belt sash. The camera makes sure to track the ball from the moment it leaves the girls' fingertips to when it swishes thru the net. These girls know how to play.

***Possible SPOILERS in the paragraph***

In a tumultuous time in which women everywhere were breaking barriers, and specifically in 1972, Cathy Rush came to coach at Immaculata College. And in 1972, against all odds, the Mighty Macs won the inaugural national college women's basketball tournament. And won it again the following year, in 1973. And again in 1974. Imagine what their opponents must've felt during that era, each time they stepped on the hardwood. Not only did they have to play the Macs but they also had to face a horde of nuns actively praying for an Immaculata victory. Heck, maybe Cathy Rush's overwhelming record of 149 wins set against only 15 losses may be attributed to divine intervention more so than uncanny coaching prowess.

The DVD's bonus stuff is pretty absorbing. There are 3 Deleted Scenes, including a cheer from the Immaculata cheerleading squad, composed of enthusiastic elderly nuns (totaling 00:04:42 minutes). The two featurettes - ""The Making Of THE MIGHTY MACS"" (00:23:48 minutes) and ""THE MIGHTY MACS ESPN Segment"" (00:06:22 minutes) - provide a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at the Immaculata women's basketball dynasty. For example, did you know that the nuns and other Mighty Macs supporters would beat on buckets with a wooden dowel to cheer their team on? And, as an added treat, keep an eye out for cameos from the real Cathy Rush (as a bank teller) and her husband Ed Rush (as an elderly passerby on the sidewalk who donates to the school).

I was lucky enough to be able to borrow this DVD from one of the actors who played in it. His name is Bill Johnson and he has maybe a fifteen second part in ""The Mighty Macs"" when he points Coach Cathy Rush (Carla Gugino) to where the girls locker-room is, which is not really a locker-room at all just the Ladies Room. Anyway, I watched the movie with my wife and loved it. I asked Bill if I could hold on to the DVD for a few days so I could show it to my daughter, who runs on the same high school cross country team as Bill's daughter, and he said yes.

""Mighty Macs"" is a story which clearly illustrates what can be gained through sacrifice, hard work, and perseverance. It also conveys the message that women should not allow themselves to be defined by others, but should believe in themselves and not be afraid to set their goals high.
Cathy Rush (who was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2008) was a role model for so many young women who learned from her that teamwork is vital, and that something worth doing is worth doing well.

The neglected husband who at first resents his wife never being around is bland and overdone in the movies but that's another story.
At the end you get some black and white clips of what the coach and the college girls went on to do. Interesting that several of them were inspired to become coaches for female teams.

I also realize that I am the first person to rate it 3 stars and I need to tell you why. It has already been pointed out that the two characters are viewed going into a bar and ordering ""Whatever you got on tap that is coldest."" Knowing many Catholics, this was not a shock to me and actually made the chacters seem more human and realistic.
But, as humorous as it was, when the coach put on a Nun's habit and even confessed that she wasn't even Catholic in order to get a free plane ticket .. I think the honesty part of the movie and the Catholic faith dropped slightly. I know there are people out there that say this was just an entertaining part of the movie and that it ""probably"" didn't REALLY happen. It was for a really good cause and ... EVERYBODY does stuff liike this. The airline isn't going to go broke because they gave a free seat to someone they thought was a Catholic Nun. The actual school teaches honesty (although it wasn't shown in the movie) and .. and ... it was JUST a movie, Kerry.
Well, it was advertised as inspirational and based on actual events and rated as such it looses a couple of points for what I assume (hope?) was poetic license.

4622482,5,B0059XTU7W,"Take a trip back to 1971 when women's college basketball was just beginning. Not many women tried out for the sport, and it was far from being taken seriously.  The Immaculata, a small Catholic college, has just hired a new basketball coach - Cathy Rush - to coach the Macs. Cathy's goal is to turn the inexperienced women's team with a losing streak into a #1 team. However, there isn't much hope. The college gymnasium recently burned to the ground. Most of the players lack experience. Cathy's unorthodox ideas aren't exactly embraced by the Nuns at the college, and financial problems abound threatening to close Immaculata. Old uniforms and a lack of funds to purchase shoes and travel to games add to the troubles. Can Cathy, along with her assistant coach, a Nun named Sister Sunday, turn things around for the flailing team?

There are many great moments in this movie. One of the girls comes from a poverty-stricken home. When pictures are taken, she wears her only outfit - a pair of ratty overalls and old boots. The result is an act of compassion that, for me, was a tearjerker moment.  Another great moment is when Cathy has the chance to confront her former basketball coach and does so with grace toward someone who had caused her much pain.

There are some humorous moments throughout this movie as well. Viewers will want to be sure to watch The Mighty Macs ESPN segment at the end of the movie, which shows coverage from the real games and highlights some of the real-life players,  as well as, the real Cathy Rush.

I enjoyed this movie. It's a heartwarming and touching story for the entire family about an underdog team and the value of teamwork. I have added it to my mom-approved listing of family movies on my wordpress blog.

4622483,5,B0059XTU7W,"Last October, I previewed a great family movie hitting the theaters called The Mighty Macs.

The film stars Carla Gugino, David Boreanaz, and Ellen Burstyn. It tells the inspirational story of Cathy Rush, who in 1971 led a struggling Catholic women's college (Immaculata) basketball team to win the very first National Women's Basketball Championship.

The movie is filled with strong performances, an appealing cast of characters, and everything which makes a good family film. I also liked how the movie reflects the struggle women in the early 1970's faced as they tried to find their place on the national sports scene--like having to prepare for a game in the women's bathroom because there was no women's locker room available.

These women were making history.

The first time I watched The Mighty Macs my husband didn't get to watch it with me. When the DVD arrived for review, we sat down together for an impromptu home date night. I'm happy to report my husband enjoyed the film as much as I did. The story is compelling, and there is more than enough humor and sports action to make it interesting. So let me encourage you to give this movie a try. The DVD has some nice extras including deleted scenes, The Making of The Mighty Macs, and a segment aired on ESPN filled with interviews of Cathy Rush and members of the original Immaculata Women's Basketball team.",1330387200,2,1374,4.809322033898305

4622486,5,B0059XTU7W,"It's 1971. Cathy Rush is a woman ahead of her time ... and she's about to embark on an adventure for the ages. A new era is dawning in the country and in collegiate athletics, where a national champion will be crowned for the first time in women's basketball.

In the lead up to this historical season, major universities are preparing their game plans to win that first title. Meanwhile a tiny all-women's Catholic college in Philadelphia has a more modest goal: find a coach before the season begins. Providentially, Cathy Rush is about to find Immaculata College.

Recently married, Cathy is dealing with the aftermath of a truncated playing career. While cultural norms would have her staying at home, she's willing to do the hard work necessary to help her new team reach their goals--or perhaps she's just trying to achieve her unfulfilled dreams through them.

From the beginning, her challenges are as imposing as the big-school teams Immaculata will face on the court. Cathy learns there is no gymnasium on campus, she receives little support from the school's Mother Superior, and the school is in dire financial straits. To top it off, she may not even have enough players to field a team!

While it appears the Macs don't have a prayer, all hope is not lost. With the help of Sister Sunday--a spunky assistant coach--and the support of a booster club of elderly nuns, Coach Rush creates a new game plan that just might bring the team--and the school--together.

Will this pioneer buck cultural norms and spur her rag-tag team to unexpected heights? Or will her hard-driving ways create a wedge between the coach and everyone around her? One thing's for certain: there's never been anyone like Cathy Rush at Immaculata!

THE MIGHTY MACS is based on the incredible true story of the 1971-72 Immaculata College team that started in obscurity but became the original Cinderella story in women's basketball. This team of pioneers went from barely making that inaugural tournament to the first dynasty in their game. And Cathy Rush, the woman that was ahead of her time, became immortalized when she was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.

THE MIGHTY MACS stars Carla Gugino as Cathy Rush; David Boreanaz as her husband, NBA referee Ed Rush; Marley Shelton as Sister Sunday; and Academy Award and Tony Award winner Ellen Burstyn as Mother St. John. The film was written, directed, and produced by Tim Chambers. The film's executive producers are Pat Croce, the former president of the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers, and Vince Curran, a successful businessman and former basketball star at Penn. Curran and Chambers are founders and partners of Quaker Media.

As a concerned parent, we are always looking for great movies that have a truth about them, a moral message to be gained from simply just heading to the movies for a night of family fun and entertainment, and it's such an honor to share this one with my readers. For those of you that are huge fans of family-feel good movies like Fireproof, Courageous or Seven Days To Utopia, then I know you will want to see this one.

But when she takes the underdog girls basketball team all the way to the national championships, those who previously doubted her begin to take notice.

  Cathy Rush is recently married and decides she doesn't want to be a stay at home wife, but wants to see if she has it in her to become a coach.
  She faces many challenges besides going against huge universities, she learns the college has no gymnasium on campus, it burned down a few months ago, she doesn't receive any support from the Mother Superior and the school is in really bad financial path. Another thing she doesn't know if she will have enough players for a team.
  After all of the problems Cathy finds an assistant in a nun who helps her in many ways and gives her hope and inspires her.
  You need to watch this to see what happens, if the team wins, if the school crumbles, if her husband hates what she is doing.
  I really recommend this great DVD for family night. It is full of fun, inspiring, never give up scenes. Besides the wonderful movie on the DVD you will see deleted scenes, The making of the movie The Mighty Macs and a real segment from the ESPN network on real Mighty Macs. Also some of the nuns in the DVD were the real players from the first Mighty Macs team. Really loved this DVD, Christian movie at it's best.

Their success as young women athletes helped raise public awareness and  consciousness about what young women could accomplish. It is a shame it does not get circulation on cable channels. I think there are a lot of young girl basketball players and parents who would find this story enjoyable and inspiring.,1518739200,,386,5.126984126984127

8463072,5,B0059XTU7W,"My daughter who plays basketball really loved it.
She recommends it for age 10+ and is definitely going to watch it again (also we had to buy it.)
The only thing that she was not happy about was that there was three scenes in the trailer,
that were not actually in the movie.
But over all definitely a good, heartfelt movie.",1515283200,,324,4.327868852459017

However the DVD was loose in the case when we opened it. I'm surprised it even played. with it being that scratched.",1514332800,,128,4.375
