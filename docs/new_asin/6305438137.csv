1021263,5,6305438137,"Terrence Malick is a director with an endearing eye for visual poetry.  His adaptation of James Jones' ""The Thin Red Line"" beautifully contrasts the terror of war with the utter beauty of nature and love (the  flashbacks of one soldier's lost girlfriend - acted beautifully by the  gorgeous Miranda Otto - are sweet and heart-breaking).  Malick has  constructed a cinematic poem using the backdrop of tall, green grass and  the blood which stains its blades.  He is commenting on the way in which  war tears apart the things we cherish:  love, nature, freindship, and life.  The cinematography, as with Malick's earlier ""Days of Heaven"",  is breathtaking and powerfull.  This is one of the most beautifull films I  have ever seen (the last shot of a single, lonely coconut laying in the  sand is simply brilliant).  Beautifull!!!",925603200,,829,4.992647058823529

If you want to see mind-numbing blood and gore don't watch this movie, you won't understand it.  However, if you enjoy a  movie that challenges your thought process, then see this movie.

1021400,2,6305438137,"This was the second time I watched this movie. I seemed to have forgotten how anti-war this movie truly is. The anti-war message in the beginning of the movie slowly starts to trickle over viewers but becomes blatantly obvious in the latter portions of the movie. The goal of the pacific campaign was to capture and hold pacific islands. This didn't seem to be mentioned in great detail by the participants in the movie. To me it seemed like a mindless rendition of a war movie where the setting (pacific campaign) had little to do with the story. In fact I felt that the anti-war sentiments and storyline were written before the setting was even introduced. Unlike real life, everyone appears inept in everything except being whiny fearful men. Look at any pacific memoir and you see that fear is present, but not every soldier uses it to create a shakespearean play of depression and hopelessness. In reality the fighting men in the pacific did experience horror and death but their perseverance is also noted. The tone of 'the pacific' is respectful to the men who fought and died. The Thin Red Line stands on those corpses in order to push an agenda.",1514851200,,1154,4.689655172413793

1021405,5,6305438137,"This movieis amazing for a war film. It is violent and bloody but also have a lot of moments where its silent, theres a lot of times no one talks and it's purely psychological and emotional. This movie is kind of strange. Really huge name actors with very short or small roles. Big name actors on screen for 2 min only, or dying before the film is even half done, Etc. I wish Woody Harrelson was in the entire movie until the end, hes so good and seems very underrated. I am not overly familiar with the actual WW2 event that is portrayed here, however to me the whole military assignment seems pointless and not necessary, and like all these men were sent to their deaths for no good reason. Bad decisions are made, and avoided, lives lost and saved also. It is clear that the parallel between some soldiers seeing the Japanese as inhuman enemies or  other soldiers realizing these were human beings with the same feelings, just doing their job also, is supposed to be well thought out and in your face here. It is worth seeing. I saw it twice 18 years apart. This movie is over 2 1/2 hours long but it doesn't seem that way. I liked it very much, and I am not even a fan of war films really. Preferred this one over Saving Private Ryan, though both are excellent in their own way.",1511049600,,1282,4.319502074688796

1021480,5,6305438137,"It's a World War II platoon movie, but unlike either the postwar ""guts and glory"" movie or the more recent ""anti-war war movie,"" this one has the daring to head out on its own and succeed.  Set on a Pacific island still in the hands of the Japanese, Terence Malick's feature presents both the act of war (seizing the island) and the moral by-products of war.  A terrific cast including Jim Caviezel, Elias Koteras, John Travolta and George Clooney -- truly, stars popping up all the time.  My favorite actor in this movie, though, is Nick Nolte as an embittered lifer, too young to have seen action in the prior world war and too old to make much of a difference in this one.

After watching last night, I was overcome again. This is such a powerfully profound film. Jim Caviezel  is perfect in his role. His eyes, alone, tell so much about who his character is. He does an amazing performance throughout. Sean Penn also did an outstanding performance in his role. The cinematography, music, and direction are all excellent and make this an amazing art film which takes place during WW2.",1506729600,,586,4.425925925925926
1021486,2,6305438137,"A disappointment, much as I love Terrence Malick's work. This is only nominally a WWII film--the WWII setting (Guadalcanal) has been heavily filtered through Vietnam: brutally obtuse officers, cowardly privates, a couple of NCOs with their heads screwed on straight, and nobody knows why they are there. The acting is generally good--watch for Kirk Acevedo getting it in the gut here, where as Joe Toye in Band of Brothers he lost a leg.

Was really surprised at how much Gene Siskel liked it as I thought he was usually an astute critic. But alas, a swing and a miss here by both Siskel and Malick.",1506038400,,599,4.704761904761905

The division commander MG Vandegrift, assistant division commander BG Rupertus, and combat leaders such as Col Puller, and LTC Edson were extremely competent and heroes of the first degree.  They obviously were very competent combat leaders because the US soundly defeated the Japanese, turning the tide of the ground war in the Pacific.  US marines and US Army follow on troops conducted themselves with valor and fighting skill as evidenced by the lopsided results.  Combat on Guadalcanal cost 1600 US KIA.  The Japanese suffered over 20000 KIA.  The movie is obviously anti-USA, anti-war. It was a waste of my time and money.",1504483200,3,843,5.192592592592592

1021642,5,6305438137,"Most war movies encapsulate run-of-the-mill plot lines and human trivialities, but The Thin Red Line departs from the bleak and overly commercialized blockbusters that most film-makers produce these days. The movie is less of a story about World War II and more of a Freudian analysis of conflict in general. In the movie, many soldiers struggle to face the bombs and explosions raining upon them. Some men spit with rage and throw temper tantrums while other men forget who they are. On the other hand, there are a few men who are loosely tethered - yet sensitive - to the events around them; they may be scared, confused, angry, or entirely indifferent to the noise around them, but they have an unshakable grasp of their surroundings. This small demographic is one of those psyches explored in the movie, but it is the most focal group.

The movie follows the intermittent musings of a calm and deliberate man aptly named Private Witt. As he traverses brush and jungle foliage, he vaguely relates prior experiences to the events he experiences on Guadalcanal. Other soldiers share similar reminiscent instances throughout the movie as the Americans push against the entrenched Japanese forces. Each soldier's recollection offers a meaningful examination of war and humanity. The memories and revelations do not add anything particularly truthful to the actual events at Guadalcanal or even anything universally truthful (depending on one's point of view, to be sure). However, the stories are incredibly insightful and engaging for a war movie. The acting is believable, captivating, and inspiring. The movie also features a long list of great actors, including, (to name a few), Sean Penn, Jim Caviezel, John Cusack, Adrien Brody, John Reilly, Nick Nolte, Miranda Otto, Woody Harrelson, John Travolta, and George Clooney.

There are other WWII / war related movies I enjoy, but The Thin Red Line is the most substantive and compelling war movie I've ever seen. If you want to watch something that can transport you between a battlefield and a calm ocean-front beach, this is the movie for you.",1485129600,10,2097,5.093023255813954

There's always someone wanting to conquest land and even the entire world.  Today we have the Jihadists who want to conquer the world and Russia and China who want to expand by conquest.  The film was also replete with angst.  Men constantly asking how many will be killed.  They of course were naturally scared, but such defeatist talk was not allowed because it was considered unlucky, omens for certain doom.  This film comes from an extremely naive perspective.  Oh and of course we have our psychotic commander who doesn't care how much blood needs to be shed to get his promotion.  The perfect role for Nolte since he's good at playing the psychopath.  There's nothing wise or visionary about this film.  it sends the message war is hell and it's cruel to human nature and even nature, like baby birds. Of course war is cruel, horrible and heartless.  I mean, DUH!  Regrettably there are aggressors in the world who want to kill people with different beliefs.  They want to kill for land, and the hard truth is we need to defend ourselves and we sometimes must go on the offense to do so.

1021783,5,6305438137,"This is such a powerful film that I can only watch it once a year and I have seen it now over fifteen times since it was released in 1989.  It is such a gut-wrenching experience that I feel I was there at Guadalcanal in 1942 with these men thrust into a situation few should ever know.  This film captures the grimness of man and the nature of reality that only a poet can capture.  Terrence Malick, the writer/director is such a visionary that he was overwhelmed by many first-class Hollywood actors, even if they only got a walk-on cameo role, when he was casting this film.
Listen to the words (""War does not enable man; it turns them into dogs - it poisons the soul."").  Soak in the imagery (the violence of man/ the beauty of nature).  Experience the emotions (fear, loyalty, pride, disgust).  Roger Ebert was wrong, Malick knew exactly what he wanted to convey in this film; deep reflections on the greatest paradoxes that man must confront in his life: good/evil, life/death, bravery/fear, beauty/ugliness.  The massacre of the defeated Japanese soldiers in their camp by the triumphant US Army, is a gut-grinding portrayal of the inhumanity of man.
This is not simply a war film but a rare example of what great movies and art are really about: ""feeling life"".

It seems everybody (according to this movie) went into battle with either PTSD or extreme cowardice and only became ""brave"" when they did something bordering on a psychotic split personality. Nick Nolte (Lt. Col. Tall) and Sean Penn (1st Sgt. Edward Welsh) were the only sane people in the movie. I prefer movies that are closer to reality, if that is what the intent of a movie is, rather than a version that is written and directed by a group that is on Prozac and potential suicide candidates due to all of the evils in the world.

Malick likes to preach to the audience, he does that with ""The thin red Line"" and  he put me into a coma with it when watching ""The tree of Life"" which I found prozaic to say the least. The intensity of the battle scenes was tremendous, I felt I was there with the soldiers, bravo for this and his camera people. The acting was solid, special mention  must be made of Nick Noltes bombastic turn as an ego driven officer and also for John Cusacks short time on screen as a captain leading the attack on a Japanese bunker. The thought provoking look on Cusacks face after the attack when he was talking to a dismissive Nolte about possible medals for the other members of the squad spoke volumes about what he thought of Nolte. ""The thin red Line"" is a good movie but I think it is weighed down by its delusions of grandeur therefore  preventing it from being a great movie which I blame Malick and his direction for.",1457049600,,1194,4.384615384615385

Don't check in if you are looking for the adventure and action side of a World War Two film.  You'll see a few attacks and violence, but the vast majority of the time you'll be away from all of those events.  The movie is quite slow in pace and its primary purpose is to be introspective in spirit.  The biggest pros of it are the visuals and cinematography which were quite memorable as in I can still recall a few of them well enough eighteen years later after only one viewing.

1022059,4,6305438137,"The Thin Red Line is one of those war films where it stars all kinds of big name actors but doesn't quite have the substance to back up the story and make it truly memorable.  Basically it's split between good and bad parts.

The good is that when the suspense comes and these soldiers face the Japanese out in the weeds, hills and fields, it's *really* graphic and exciting.  These segments are quite the sight to behold.  You really feel awful that these soldiers are faced in such a do or die situation based on their believable facial expressions of worry and concern.  The bad is that the movie relies so heavily on so many famous actors that the actual story being told feels like it falls by the wayside a little so everyone gets their time in the spotlight.

The narration is also somewhat annoying.  It goes from pretentious and overdone to being almost poetic in a way that doesn't accurately portray a war scenario.  At least not in my eyes (not that I've ever been on the battlefield so it's understandable to take what I say with a grain of salt).  I mean war involves guns, death and blood.  The narration (from the soldiers point of view) doesn't quite express this kind of brutally honest reality.  Instead it feels like a poem being recited and it comes across awkwardly to me.  Plus there's constantly a serious amount of downtime that can last 20-25 minutes at a time.  I wasn't exactly expecting a full-fledged action movie but they could have trimmed away some of the slower moments without losing any of the meaning.

Anyway the actors are Adrien Brody (who doesn't get as much attention as I was hoping for), Jim Caviezel (who's the star of the movie), Sean Penn of course (all the ladies love him right?), Nick Nolte (who I often confuse for that Gary Busey guy), Elias Koteas, George Clooney (who doesn't appear until the end), John Cusack (funny, for a while I didn't know whether that was him or someone who looks like him!), Ben Chaplin, John Travolta (who doesn't get much attention either) and Jared Leto.  What a cast!

My favorite moment other than the one when the American soldiers walk the fields and hide in the weeds scanning the hills for Japanese soldiers, is when the Americans finally overpower and take over the Japanese, so we see the Japanese captured and speaking in their own language without subtitles so we have to guess what was being said.  When the one Japanese guy was dying and watching the birds circling above in the sky while lying beside the American soldier... very sad.  I would have liked more sympathy from the Americans instead of a ""Let's go man, let's kill 'em all!"" type of attitude, especially from Nick Nolte.  This is yet another movie that makes me question who really won the war on ground, because it seems the Japanese had a stronger advantage based on this and several other movies.

This Thin Red Line does several things right, but the story is long-winded to the point of interfering with the flow.  The segments with the one soldier constantly remembering and fantasizing about his girlfriend/wife at home occur way too often as well.  Still, amazing presentation and worth watching.",1441756800,,3160,4.666064981949458

On the plus side, the cinematography is amazing. It is almost like the camera is an auxilliary actor. The beauty of the jungle set against the uglyness of battle is striking. I don't want to sound too artsy-fartsy, but it's true. I don't recall seeing another movie that affected me in the same way.
On the down side, character development is hit-or-miss. Perhaps Malick wanted it this way, but most of the soldiers don't really come across as individuals. The career soldier played by Nick Nolte and the moony Pvt. Witt (Caviezel) are notable exceptions. Some of the other characters appear so briefly they don't really leave any kind of impression.

After what seemed like the 20th time, I said to my date, ""If that comes on the screen again, we're OUTTA HERE!"" And it did, and we were.

It's supposed to be an existential exploration of the human condition and the heart of man, yadda yadda yadda. What it is is pretentious, tiresome, artsy crap. Critics and viewers say they love it basically because they didn't understand it, it makes no sense (and what little that does in the film is beat to death), but they don't want to admit the Emperor has no clothes",1430697600,3,717,4.272058823529412
1022383,1,6305438137,"When scientists first saw it, they refused to believe their eyes. They thought it was a hoax, bits and pieces of other beings crudely sewn together. But its no hoax; its a platypus.

A dark figure approaches on the horizon. Is it an enemy soldier, or just a native looking for coconuts? A red line across a green leaf. Is it a splash of paint or a streak of blood?

Supposedly, there is a thin red line between peace and war, order and chaos. One can easily traverse it and be in a totally different world. Its like walking out of Platos dark cave into the sunlight, or doubting everything that exists and realizing, like Descartes, that the mind is all that exists, or engaging in a Husserlian epoch&eacute;, liberating consciousness and reducing the world to pure phenomena.  This ability to transcend the natural attitude and see the pure world is exploited in the character Private Witt, who confronts his sergeant with Im twice the man you are. Shades of Nietzsche here.

Why all the philosophical implications? Terrence Malicks academic aspirations were in philosophy (Harvard; Oxford) but a disagreement about his dissertation on Kierkegaard and Heidegger put him on a different track, i.e., filmmaking. In Hollywood he got his doctorate and then some, but are his movies really philosophy, least of all, phenomenology?

For moviegoers who like visuals (not necessarily special effects), Thin Red Line is attractive. It keeps you interested. Many reviewers criticize it for being boring, the flashbacks to sexual moments, the close-ups of tropical flora, picturesque landscapes, etc. Appealing to artists, poets, and philosophers, maybe, but not the average moviegoer.

Take for instance Hubert Dreyfus YouTube lectures on Heideggers Being and Time. Lecture 1 has over 2500 views, but lecture 28 has only 35 views. And Dreyfus has to be the most popular philosophy professor in the United States. I mean, Berkeley professor and famous artificial intelligence critic. Malick even invited him to the set of Thin Red Line, yet his appeal is minimal.

The Battle of Guadalcanal is more correctly called the Guadalcanal Campaign, since there were several battles conducted between August 1942 and February 1943, land, sea, and air. Malick must have researched the history of this and there were several interesting battles to choose from, but unfortunately he chose the story of the novel The Thin Red Line by James Jones. Apparently, he figured the novels realism coming from Jones combat experiences in the campaign were more easily adaptable than the historical or military accounts. But is it realistic?

The landing of a battalion of Marines on a beach is dramatic and a lot of details were carefully worked out, except for one thing. The sand on the beach had thousands of footprints on it, obvious traces of many rehearsals.

A marine grabs a grenade by the pin and the grenade falls to the ground. It explodes, he falls to the ground and says something stupid about not remembering how grenades work and Blows my assblows my foot off! Im not sure of the firepower of grenades used in WWII, but if they were as powerful as those used in Vietnam, the explosion would have blown his whole body away, buddies included.

The assault is up a grassy hill yet the incoming enemy artillery is immediate. There is an enemy bunker complex at the top of the hill supposedly armed with machine guns, but the marines are bombarded with artillery from nowhere. The only heavy weapon capable of hitting the other side of a hill or mountain is a mortar, and that would be heard as soon as it was fired, giving the Marines time to take cover.

No one used field maps to navigate the landing and assaults, not even the battalion commander. Radios weren't used to communicate between units and mysteriously appear later in the battle when Lt. Colonel Tall chews out Captain Staros for not attacking while a gratuitous 105 Howitzer goes off in the background providing supporting fire that doesnt seem to be part of the same movie.

The eventual attack of the hilltop bunker is done by a six-man squadvolunteers, which is very stupid, since they don't have any weapons other than rifles and grenades. What ever happened to the infamous bazooka and flamethrowers so heavily used in the Pacific? Anyway, they finally get the brilliant idea to call in an artillery strike with coordinates taken out of the air (maps are too troublesome), and totally annihilate the hilltop. But wait, the machinegun keeps pumping out lead. How could that be? The bunker is made of only wood and clay! Too many phony special effects, really. Didnt battleships provide supporting fire? If they did, it would have decapitated the entire hilltop! That would have been any commanders call, given the odds against fighting uphill.

No other movie has captured the sound of incoming rounds better than ""All Quiet on the Western Front."" At least that's how I compare it to the real thing.

There seemed to be no strategic preparation for the assault on the island other than some ambiguous remarks between the commanding general (Travolta) and the battalion commander (Nolte), and the marines carried hardly anything that they would have needed to survive, i.e., canteens, machine guns, ammo, mortars, C-rations, radios, maps, ponchos, etc.

The movie has a patchwork style and is intentionally disorganized, to convey to the viewer the essence of war. But war is not this way. It is the most organized and intensive enterprise man undertakes; its been this way since the ancient Greeks. Life for marines on a ship headed for combat is very regimented and filled with physical, tactical, and weapons training. We see none of that in this movie. Malick missed a great opportunity here to show how this all breaks down in actual combat.

The musical score is the most boring and monotonous Ive ever heard in a movie. War is not like this. Marines are not zombies that walk around with blank stares thinking poetic thoughts. There is not one moment of comic relief in this movie. Why it was nominated for seven Academy Awards says to me that Hollywood is largely ignorant of American history and war.

The worst and most hysterical part of the movie was the river patrol where bombs of unknown origin go off in the background while the marines stand in the middle of the river talking about what they should do next. How stupid.

When the battalion departed the island, it looked like half had lost their helmets or else the actors refused to wear them in the tropical heat. Malick would not have been a good marine and it shows. Most likely, he would have walked off daydreaming like Private Witt and been shot. A cheap deus ex machina.

It surprises me that though there were many military advisors, probably men who had actually taken part in the Guadalcanal Campaign, the movie got it all wrong. The props seemed to be correct; at least the marines weren't carrying M-16s, and they found some resurrected Hellcats to take off and land, making it look period. Malick wrote the screenplay, directed the movie, and so, he is primarily responsible for the way the movie turned out.

To the credit of the producers, the movie was shot on location, so if you want to see what the Solomon Islands flora and fauna look like, this is the movie. Otherwise, it remains a platypus.",1430524800,6,7331,4.863672814755413

It looks at different personalities and looks at emotions rather than following a central narrative. It is simply gorgeous to look at, and it is really a movie that takes a philosophical look at war and its effects on ordinary people (and how people react differently to it) and the film accomplishes this without getting too preachy or too melodramatic.

This film that has an ensemble cast of talented actors tells a fictionalized account of the Battle of Mount Austen that is part of the Guadalcanal Campaign in the Pacific Theater during the Second World War. It gives an account of the soldiers of the C Company, 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment and the 25th Infantry Division. Also,it marks the return of veteran director Terrence Malick after a twenty-year absence.

This is definitely a great war film. No question about it. It deals with war not as a part of history,politics and ethics but that of an inevitable threat to human existence.

Director Terrence Malick focuses on the conflict at Guadalcanal from ground up and showing empathy and apathy along the way. Nick Nolte's performance as an over the hill Lieutenant Colonel trying to impress a very shallow and aloof Brigadier Geneneral (John Travolta) is moving. THE THIN RED LINE is a devastating film. The philosophical and psychological nature and the morality of war within that context seems to be present in some form in Terrence Malick's film. I see Nick Nolte as Colonel Tall as the most tragic figure in this film. In some respects he appears to be sacrificing men for the advancement of his own career, but he is sacrificing his own soul in the process trying to impress the high command of a military by delivering the objective. Nolte fails to see that he has been passed over for many years now and if he doesn't get the job done then someone else will.",1421625600,,987,4.581920903954802

1022526,5,6305438137,"The Thin Red Line is by far the best war movie of all time. It came out in 1998 and had nine A-list actors in it. Those actors include Sean Penn, Adrien Brody, Jim Caviezel, George Clooney, John Cusack, Woody Harrelson, Nick Nolte, John C. Reilly, and John Travolta. It was nominated for seven Academy Awards and was directed by Terrence Malick. The original music was composed strictly for the movie by Hans Zimmer; some of the original music has been used in other movies after 1998. There are several reasons why I think this is the best war movie of all time; plot, dialogue, actors, and cinemagraphy.
As far as the plot goes, it could not be any better. It gives you a closer look at how war effects everyone involved; even the family left behind. It shows how mind sets and thoughts change as war moves along. It also has several stories going at one time that is all tied together throughout the movie. I would have some people argue that Saving Private Ryan is the best war movie of modern times; which it is a great movie, just not as good as The Thin Red Line. Saving Private Ryan has only one plot that consists of a point A to point B plot. The dialogue of the actors is superb; Sean Penn and Jim Caviezel nail it. Just listening to these soldiers tells how they feel about whats going on around them. Not only on the battle field but whats also left behind in the states. And I cant begin to explain how well Terrence Malick brought these characters to life, simply amazing. The actors where incredible in this movie, Terrence Malick brought in the big boys to fill these roles. Every character in this movie nailed their part. Thats why they are A-list actors. The cinemagraphy in this movie was absolutely the best I have ever seen. The shots Terrence Malick used in this film were above and beyond the call of duty. He knows how to draw you in as if you were there on the front lines.
Gene Siskel called it, the greatest contemporary war film Ive seen. If you have never seen this movie, I would suggest buy it on Amazon for five dollars. It will be the best five dollars you have ever spent. The Thin Red Line is in my opinion the best war movie of all time.",1419897600,8,2175,4.346437346437346

1022644,5,6305438137,"My favorite movie.

War isn't all glory and camaraderie; it's also people dying, not knowing what to do, making mistakes, and losing touch with reality.

It's a very visually stunning movie, which juxtaposes the gritty reality or war.  It makes one wonder at times throughout the movie: ""why do we pervert our beautiful world? Our reality could be so different.""  The great filming and cinematography also serves to pull in the unwilling or resistive viewer; to open up all our minds for the existential ride on which the film takes us.  It still outs me into a near hypnotic state.

Yes, there is a lot of open space in this movie, but there is in life, too.  If you can't grasp the things life and/or God is trying to tell or show you in those moments (which often tell us more about life than active moments), then perhaps you should stick to Keanu Reeves movies (of course those movies have their place, too).

Like other Malick films I've seen, it's an existential triumph.  If you are a Sensing (MBTI) person with an underdeveloped iNtuitive side, you may want to skip this film, until you further develop that side of your personality.  This film is NOT about the action of war, it's about the things that connect mankind to nature and itself.

I do not recommend paying any money to see this movie unless you are a big fan in war films, then it is a great choice. If you are a person that does not know about every battle from every war then this movie is really not for you.

1022725,4,6305438137,"It's really a coincidence that I should have picked this unseen film off my shelf to watch on Veterans Day. Incorporated within its terribly long running time, ca 2 hours, 40 minutes, is a very good war film focussed on the Battle of Guadalcanal, the first significant victory for American ground forces in the long march to defeat Japan after Pearl Harbor. It's quite irrelevant to me whether or not the film follows to the letter any particular segment of the combat or generalizes to make its cinematic points. The significant point is that it shows clearly that the focal point of War is killing and being killed. It does not underline another point, although it illustrates it, armies, to use the classic term, must be ""blooded"" before becoming effective fighting instruments.  These guys had no idea of what combat was like, their leaders, from many of the Generals on down through squad leaders, had no real experience either. Some of the highest rankest officers and very senior non-commissioned personnel had seen combat in World War 1....ended only a quarter century previously. Mistakes at every level were inevitable, dead and broken bodies were (and still are) the price of experience. That is shown here but, mistakenly, in some important cases, treated as acts of self-aggrandisement. The film is accurate in not showing these first troops using the flamethrowers which, five months into combat, became an effective weapon against entrenched Japanese forces. These are Army troops,  but only in a single line before the landing, does the overall Commander indicate that they are coming in to reinforce the initial Marine forces which had suffered heavy casualties from Japanese arms and indigenous diseases. These details hardly matter to the narrative of combat: men suffer mental breakdown, fear, and a great number of casualties when facing an entrenched enemy,
So, I found the pre-combat and combat scenes quite satisfactory. Here we come to a matter of taste and aesthetic outlook, very personal things. I found the heavy dose of poetics tiresome, the inordinate length beyond my capacity-particularly when so much of that time was spent (for me) in irrelevant poesy. If you are like those reviewers who loved the stuff, you will, no doubt, happily get your fill; if you are somewhat like me in this respect, it does not render the film unwatchable, just makes the good parts like the sweet chocolate center beneath a very sour ball exterior.",1415664000,2,2462,5.046683046683047

This film is a must-see for anyone and everyone. The sheer lunacy of war in that it kills, maims, and causes people to look at it in a selfish fashion. We are shown that war is not about glory. It is completely destructive in every way. There was a scene when a soldier was trying to wonder why he was fighting and had a handful of dirt. Was that all it was about? While it is honorable to free people enslaved to a dictator's whims and horrors, is it morally correct to throw oneself into the fray and kill without thought or questioning?

The Colonel was afraid of the Captain who challenged his orders to what would have been complete and utter suicide. In real life, that situation would not end well. However, in the film, the Colonel knew he was wrong and while he could not admit it, the end result was success in taking that hill and he likely would have received glory and praise and medals and promotion from it. He owed the Captain that much, since it was due to the argument and delay that produced the necessary time for the battalion to make the necessary move. The Colonel had never fought in battle before Guadalcanal and had not one clue what his men were up against.

In the end, the light was present and it was peaceful once again. The animals, trees, water and the native people would continue on. The scars of the land and soul were one and the same.

The juxtaposition of birds, crocodiles, leaves, grass, and bats with the human drama of military combat (which is both beautiful and tragic) tells its own story.  I also find it interesting that while so many big name Hollywood actors appear in this film, the real star is Nature (or Being, depending on your philosophical bent).  How often are John Travolta and George Clooney, who appear in just one scene each, treated as afterthoughts in a film?  Vanity is sublimated to life's mysteries (which may, of course, include studio politics).",1406246400,,873,5.105633802816901

1022923,5,6305438137,"This film had the unfortunate luck to be released conterminous with Saving Private Ryan. Like Wyatt Earp and Tombstone in 1993, both films have their followers and detractors. Yet I liked both Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line.

I'll never forget how The Thin Red Line affected me when I saw it in 1999. I rated it a 9.0 out of 10 and this Criterion collection only reinforced how I felt after finally seeing the film for the first time in a decade and a half.

The film is visually stunning and truly grabs the viewer's attention. It showed how the interpersonal relationships that each character has with himself, nature and his comrades in arms. Malick held back on the gore. He very well could have shown more blood and guts had he chosen to do so. The film was rated R, after all. In a sense he sold the film short because the violence showcased could have been shown on network television. Only the language would have had to be culled. There was no sex and the violence was nowhere near gratuitous.

In order to review this movie I decided to reread Michel Chion's BFI Classics book The Thin Red Line and I saw on Youtube Siskel & Ebert's discussion and I read Roger Ebert's written review from 1998. Gene Siskel felt this was the best contemporary war movie he ever saw. Ebert, while enamored with the movie did not go that far. I too would agree with Ebert. I consider this movie to be the equal of Saving Private Ryan but at the same time I highly enjoyed The Thin red Line despite its minor flaws.

Jeff Owenby in his Youtube response said: ""There were far too many actors[Characters], and the constant switching of big names without enough storylines to accommodate them hurt the movie."" This sums up the main problem with the movie. Even Roger Ebert said this. ""The soldiers are not well-developed as individual characters. Covered in grime and blood they look much alike and we strain to hear their names barked out mostly in one syllable (Welsh, Fife, Tall, Witt Gaff, Bosche, Bell Keck, Staros)."" As a result of this we the viewer have problems seeing who is who. This creates a detachment from the characters and (Unlike In saving Private Ryan) prevents us from empathizing with the characters (Save For Witt). This is the reason why so many people have not given this movie its just due.

Another problem as Roger Ebert mused (I Agree) saw it was that all of the characters seemed to mull and ponder their fates in the same voice. The voice of a much older person. In a nutshell, they were 20-year old kids acting 20-years older than they were. With the exception of Lt. Colonel Tall and Sgt. Welsh, the characters are too young to even be contemplating anything more than trying to survive their tour on Guadalcanal.

I also had questions. What happened to Sgt. McCron, the man who comes unhinged at the loss of his squad? Did he survive? was he given a Section 8? Did Dale regain his humanity after crying in the rain? Did Doll return the .45 pistol he stole? Did Lt. Tall get his promotion? He certainly deserved it. A man his age should at least have been a full Colonel, if not a Brigadier General (Like Travolta's Character Was). The movie refrains from giving us any details as to the fates of the men after they depart the island. Michel Chion writes about this eloquently in his book. He goes into great details of each character's ""inner voice."" Yet he, unlike Ebert, does not seem to realize that the musings of the men sound like that of the director, an older man. But their musings do not tell us their eventual fate nor do they foreshadow what would become of them in the future.

Roger Ebert also said on his show how the narration sounded a bit too much like the Days of Heaven narration, which distracted him when he saw The Thin Red Line. Simply put, the movies seem to have the same voice which is unrealistic. It seemed like he took the tone of the narration and moved it from the Texas wheat fields to this island in the Pacific and yet he's asking the same questions. As I mentioned earlier, this same ""voice"" does not give the characters any individuality. It only serves to make them what seem to be clones. This was not the case with the book by James Jones. Each character was delineated precisely and Ebert even says that had Spielberg done this movie it might have looked much more like Saving Private Ryan.

The battle scenes were nothing but superb! Taking Hill 210 must have been like taking Hamburger Hill, a pure hell for anyone attempting to ascend it's hellish terrain. This is where the movie grabbed and held me. The vivid scenery, the musings of the soldiers as well as the individual shots of wounded and angry wildlife. A captured crocodile, a wounded bird and a maddened snake (According To Wikipedia there Are Few Venomous Snakes On Guadalcanal).

I highly recommend this movie and I'm proud to have been the 535th person to rate it Five Stars and the 1067th overall. I also recommend you purchase Michel Chion's book. He was able to translate the words of the Japanese soldiers that surrounded Witt at the end of the movie! I'd always wondered what they were saying to him. I was fascinated when I read what they were saying. I'm still glad that Malick chose not to subtitle those words because it kept us in Witt's point of view and kept us from identifying too much with the ""enemy"" as shown in this movie. Chion's book is the perfect companion piece to this movie. See also the Siskel & Ebert segment for this film (And Any Others From Their Time Period Together). I also recommend reading Roger Ebert's original January 8, 1999 review of the movie. All of his reviews are timeless. He and Gene Siskel will always be missed.

1022924,3,6305438137,"Definitely self-indulgent on the part of the director.  Full of actors who thought they were going to be ""part of something"".  Overall pretty good though.  Pretty good battle in the middle.  Nice photography.  Not much to say, though I am sure they thought it was pure genius.  John Kusack is laughable when his little girly self volunteers to take the hill.  I just burst out laughing.  Sean Penn is his usual self-involved, self-important jerky self.  Luckily neither of them, nor anyone else, made up more than 5% of this movie.  But this 175 minute movie could easily have been culled down to 125 minutes without missing anything and it could have been culled down to 90 minutes without losing any of the meaning or the plot - what little there is.",1404345600,,752,4.67175572519084
1022925,5,6305438137,"1. I first saw this film about the year 2000. I wasn't ready for it. All I remember thinking is, this is the strangest and most beautiful war movie Ive ever seen. I had just discovered director Terrence Malick without realizing it.

2. I need to make a clarification. This is actually the strangest and most beautiful ant-war movie Ive ever seen.

3. Ive seen plenty of movies that show the physical and mental trauma of war. This is the most powerful depiction of the emotional and existential trauma of war that Ive ever seen.

4. The actual plot of the movie involves one of the key battles of Guadalcanal in World War II. But its really about the inner monologues of soldiers talking about death, existence, and God.

5. The cast itself is strange and eclectic, containing performances from John Cusack, Jared Leto, Woody Harrelson, John C. Reilly, Nick Stahl, George Clooney, and John Travolta, among others. Some of them only really appear for death scenes. There were also stars who were filmed and then cut out of the movie.

6. Sean Penn gives a wonderful performance as a sergeant who wishes he didn't care about anything. Nick Nolte is awesome as a political and cowardly colonel. Adrien Brody is in one of the shortest and most memorable scenes, when his crew discovers a dead soldier. And it should have been obvious from Jim Caviezels role that 16 years later he would play Jesus on film.

7. There is a lot of physical violence in the film. But the real damage is dealt to the characters that live.

8. The title of the film does not become clear from the movie itself. Its actually from a Kipling poem that calls foot soldiers the thin red line of heroes.

9. This is a gorgeous, profound film that a lot of people don't like. It uses war against itself to show the savagery - and the humanity - of violence.",1403913600,4,1824,4.522796352583587
1022926,5,6305438137,"I saw this in the theater on its opening weekend.  Right after it ended, my friend said, ""I want to see it again with the sound off, so I can just look at the images.  And then I want to play it again with my eyes closed, so I can just hear the words.""  Very well put.  My favorite Malick film.  One of my favorite movies ever.

But people standing in line with us that night were expecting ""Saving Private Ryan in the Pacific.""  This movie is not that.  When people left the theater that night, they were outspoken in their displeasure, but I think they missed the point.  It was not the movie's fault that it did not meet their expectations -- they had the wrong expectations.  This movie is philosophical, emotional, human -- more about life on Earth, life as a human being, than it is about war.",1402704000,4,799,4.266666666666667
1022927,4,6305438137,"I generally hesitate in writing a review of anything that has this many other reviews already posted, as it virtually guarantees that no one will read it, especially since it is a four-star one. People typically look at the one-star reviews, and maybe a five-star if it occupies, as it usually does, the proud upper-left ""most helpful"" position. I suppose this might be seen by someone who obsessively follows the discussion of this film, sorting by ""most recent"" to make sure they don't miss anything.

The film displays Malick's usual stunning images, along with the philosophical musings on the order of ""what is life?"" and ""why do I exist?"" I especially enjoyed the occasional glimpses of animals, from the crocodile at the beginning, through the rainbow lorikeets, phalangers, and especially the cluster of adorable fruit bats. We see one, then a few more, then suddenly a herd or flock of them is revealed. Nature continues in its eternal innocence, despite Mankind's endless and pointless conflicts.

What made me deduct one star was the profusion of big-name celebrities, whose presence I found distracting. I was fine with the initial entrance of Jim Caviezel, especially since this came before his later fame in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Schlemiel-Of-Monte-Cristo/dp/B005XCX2F0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Schlemiel Of Monte Cristo</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Passion-of-Mel-Gibson-s-Anti-Semitism/dp/B007HU4FJ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Passion of Mel Gibson's Anti-Semitism</a>. Next, Sean Penn, no problem, then Nick Nolte, and that would have been sufficient. Instead, a mustachioed John Travolta appears for no apparent reason, followed by glimpses of Tim Blake Nelson, John C. Reilly, Adrien Brody in a big screen-time but virtually non-speaking role, capped at the end by none other than George Clooney. Apparently, Brody's character was the protagonist of the book this film was based on, and when he first saw the completed film, he was shocked to discover how much of his role had been cut. Several other actors, including Gary Oldman, Billy Bob Thornton, Martin Sheen, Viggo Mortensen, Bill Pullman, and Mickey Rourke saw their own screen time cut out completely, possibly to keep the film under four hours. I would imagine that given the dreck Hollywood has been pumping out for decades, most stars would jump at the chance to appear in a Terence Malick film, given the director's miniscule output and reputation for the highest order of ""seriousness."" But I did not need to be pulled out of the story by ""hey, isn't that the guy who was in 'Thomas the Tank Engine meets Charles Manson' or the remake of 'Titanic' with Ayn Rand and Alan Greenspan as the star-crossed couple, or what?""

1022995,4,6305438137,"This controversial 1998 film is based on a book of the same name by James Jones.  It was filmed in Queensland Australia, as many other WWII films have been.  It covers the latter part of the Guadalcanal campaign in WWII, after the US Army's Americal Division had relieved the First Marine Division and the push was on to capture Japan's remaining strongholds such as Mt Austen, and secure the island.  Americal was reinforced by the army's less experienced 25th Division, one of whose companies was depicted in the story.
The good: a portrayal of the disruption suffered by the native Melanesians during the conflict, and the idealistic lifestyle that they seemed to lead in their 'paradise' (not necessarily accurate for the Solomons), an aspect that was usually overlooked in prosecuting the Pacific War.
The bad: too many soldiers shaking with fear, including some Japanese.  Sure, everyone was frightened at the thought of death, but at times there seemed to be so many quivering lips that it looked like a parody of the policemen in 'The Pirates of Penzance'.  There was also an 'over-the-top' colonel trying to act like a gung-ho Marine.

1022999,5,6305438137,"The Thin Red Line disappointed me on first viewing.  I was expecting a war epic like Saving Private Ryan; instead, I found a meditation on many dimensions of war: war as a metaphor for the constant battle for survival in nature; war as a metaphor for the struggle between men and women; war as metaphor for life in organizations; war as metaphor for the confrontation between modern and primitive ways of life.  I also heard profoundly philosophical ideas voiced-over by men with Southern accents--not exactly in tune with our stereotypes of the South--or of men.
The Thin Red Line is a film to live with, to view repeatedly; it is a medium to think with and through, a way to help locate yourself in relation to history, culture, and the ambiguities of life's meaning.  It is a work for the ages.  Yes, its structure feels loose at times, just as Shakespeare's structures feel loose at times.

Contrary to all the 5 star reviews of this bluray edition, as well as the accompanying spiel about the 'Spirit 4k' scan, there's too much dirt for such a recent title and transfer. I've seen Criterion restorations of older films many decades older than this that looked cleaner.

1023103,5,6305438137,"Terrence Malick is a director who always wants us to see something unique, and with ""The Thin Red Line"" he has finally become the kind of visionary that all great movie lovers have been anticipating. I won't rehash what others have said, but I have to say that, as a director, Malick commands color, image, photographic style, and cinematic flow with apparent ease. Some may argue that the performances are too subdued and the cast too ""loaded"" (in a film with so many familiar faces, who is really the ""star""?), but I think that this pretentious lineup only serves to offset the beauty of Malick's nature film (there are as many shots of animals in the film as there are of people, and this, to me anyway, indicates that Malick is working on a different level than other so-called philosophical moviemakers), which also can only go to prove that Malick understands beauty and power on a photographic level. I won't compare this movie to ""Saving Private Ryan"" because there is NO comparison; Spielberg's was a sensationalist, video-game inspired bloodbath (fun on one level, due to its great sound effects, but poor on many other levels, such as having a point), while Malick's is a sensitive, slowly paced, far more watchable picture. Like all great art, it will not please every taste, but to those of us who appreciate its design, it means something more than most war films ever will (probably because the art of war is not the principle concern of Malick in this script). Zimmer's sweeping music score is also more melancholic and memorable than the one chosen for ""Saving Private Ryan""--in its tones, you can hear the truth about the human condition trying to get out.
The Criterion disc is loaded with great options to choose from (if you aren't one who has a great deal of time), but the interviews with the principle players are great fun to watch (especially Penn's comments). The audio commentary is also very good, worth a listen any time. The booklet features a great piece by author Jones on the inadequacies of Hollywood war movies, and a critical piece that is worth investigating (by critic David Sterritt). However, my booklet smelled like it had been dropped into a crater of trench foot socks and then drug through the sands of Iwo Jima after having been sitting in the men's room at Slappy's for eight days in the broiling sun. It even stank up the DVD case! Other than that odious oversight, however, this is a keeper of a DVD set. Thank you Criterion for giving Malick the due that he deserves.

1023185,5,6305438137,"11-16-2013  I never thought I'd see a war film bette than Spielberg's ""Savbing Pvt. Ryan,"" but this george stevens Jr. entry is a gut punched ,hert-searing mindassaulting drama starring somebignames aand some of the most intense scenes ever.  it could have been the war of 1812, the war of 1861-65,the first or second worldwaroreven Viet Nam but, it is WWII and we'rer on Guadalcannal  and the Marines under GeneralJohn Trvolta attacks the Pacific island with a force intended to do amop upof the battle,won by the U.s..  The intent is to wipeout the small buttenaciousresistance ofJapanese fanaticsleft behind.  Col. Nick Nolte is a ruthlesslyambitious commander whobullies and pushes and even cajoleshis juniorofficerstodo his bidding.  He was, earlier in his career,passed over and nowhe's going to gethis.

  The film opens with idyllic scenes of James cavezelhving desertedtrying to live out the war on a tiny quiet nearby island,sparedfrom the violence but is discovered and returned to duty.  Because of the pending invasion, his crime is ovefrlooked and he loyally returnsto the war, distinguishing himselfin battle.  Much of the film is a sequence of ""you are there"" combat, close quarter style, with the equallydeterrmined Japanese, blocking the Marine'sadvance towards the target airstrip,fromwhich, in truth,the Us will take and dominate the Pacific in a 1000mileradius.  nolte pushes his commanding Captain to attack and tries to convince both him , and himself,that the attack is pariotic and noble.  We can see, however,that Nolte wants glory forhimself, and offers it to his subordinants as a bribe.  They see right through him..Seaan Penn plays the regiment's cynical, tough ,brave leadSgt. and is outstandingin his portrayal.  The Marines on the island have their own cowards, and babies, heros and stoicsand , the climactic sceneis a showdown battle of the Marines and their emeny'smain post,man to man in grat brutality, set against Hans Zimmer's unforgetable searing score, willed with both tragedy and pathos, regret,brotherly love and near supernatural devotion to do one's duty.  Deserter, Jim Cavezel is constantly visited by  whimsical and overwhelmingly beautiful flashback images of he and his wife, back homein the states.  Their scenes of dreamlike lovemaking, allfully clothed, arewonderfullytouching and moving, and I was totally stunned when my wife was unimpressed with the footage.  It is some of the most romantic materialever in the movies and well worth the timeto watch it.  And, in a completely unexpected and jar-dropping twist, at ht e movie's closingsections, afterthe main battle has been won, Cavezal gets mail rom his adoring wife in the form of a dear Jack leter.""  he has endured, as wellas his brother  Marines, she says she has met an air Forceofficer and fallen in love and wants a divorse.  ""It just got too lonely, Jack,"" she says, asnd we can feelhimfall topieces,but he endures.
  after the major bsattleof the two remaining forces, resulting in a clearMarine victory, there are scenes of heart-whrenching tenderness of japanese for each other,Marines for their comradwes and individual americans for their counterparts, which is the best part of the movie.  Whether or not this really happened , I'n not so sure but, oddly  enough, in war , as in peace, all men are brothers.
  As the remaining mrines leave Guadelcnnel,they each withdraw within themselvesand we hear gentlenarrations of their letter written to their homes,pondring,who they were as men.  It is a peaceful and touching end to a great movie experience, one which  I will remember for a long time.  In fact, it is the ONLY way this film really COULD  end, in gentle, reflective mystery.

  Years ago Tom Browka wrote the Greatest Generation, a good book, but there are many,many betterones.  He asked the rhetoricalquestion as to these soldiers, ""who were they?""  Well sir, they were North Texas bank tellersand Nebraska wheat farmers.  They were  wise-cracking Kansas City cabbies and Gorgian sheet metal workers.  They were tall and short, drinkers and tea-totalers,  they wrote poems and collected stamps ,  they prayed on their knees,  and they wandered amongst the eternity of doubt and quite  few of them played baseball.  but,they weree more than all that.  They were teachers and cops, butchers and truck drivers.  they were  fathers and sons, brothers and cousins, neighboors and strangers  They were somebody's.  In war,  everybody is somebody's.  They  were Americans,  AND  they were Japanese.  Requiece in Pace, Domine May they rest in the Peace of The Lord.

1023187,4,6305438137,"I guess I'm not surprised at the number of poor reviews of this movie. I skimmed through a few of the one star reviews and will extrapolate that they can be summarized as focusing on one or more of: (1) who needs this artsy crap (2) our glorious soldiers have not been honored sufficiently (3) not true to the novel (4) not true to history. My apologies if I've misrepresented the negativity. My sense is that a lot of people watched this film thinking they were going to see a Pacific theater flavor of Saving Private Ryan or other typical ""big"" studio war film. You would be able to root for the typical cross-section of US cultural/regional types - the New York/Brooklyn-ey guy, the egg head brooding intellectual guy, the all-American type, the various ethnic types, etc. Some of the good guys would die, and there might be a bitter sweet element, but basically good would triumph, the soldiers would (mostly) do the right thing, find their inner bravery, rise to the occasion and so on. This isn't that kind of movie.

I've seen snippets of this movie over the years, enough to sense that it was right up my alley, but just watched it for the first time a few days ago. I found it to be extremely beautiful, very moving in parts, very hard to watch in parts due to the horrific violence. There's a highly episodic plot, characters come and go, and the sequence of the story is unclear, at least to me.  This really is NOT about taking some high ground during the historical battle of Guadalcanal. It's about people living through a terrifying experience which challenges their fundamental humanity. Through intense visual storytelling, the movie attempts, successfully for me, to convey not just what is happening, but how the characters' pasts continue to inform what they're experiencing now, how they continue to exist in nature, even while they  are engaged in extreme violence. The visual story telling applied to one character's sweet, intimate recollections of his young wife was particularly effective to me, though I'm guessing this impact will vary across different users.

By the end, I wasn't sure if the parts of the film came together completely successfully; perhaps there are a bit too many of the typical war movie conventions, particularly the hardened seen-it-all veteran stuff. I will admit that some of the voice-overs drift into precious, artsy territory, but for the most part the device is very effective. Long stretches, like when the AWOL soldier is living with the natives, have no dialog and it feels like pure emotion, story, character and humanity are pouring through the screen to you. All in all, this is a very special film that I'd guess viewers will have a strong reaction to, either positive, as in my case, or negative.",1383004800,9,2761,4.806315789473684

In those cases, the humor can seem forced.  There are a couple of funny moments in this film, but they are completely organic to the moment and the characters in that moment.  From personal experience, I can relate to every character in this movie, and I don't think I've seen a movie that portrays men in combat as well as this one.  Narration is often a poor choice in filmmaking, but the choice to use it in this movie allows the audience to understand what goes through men's minds in a situation like the one presented in the film.  PVT Bell's recollections of his wife during the most perilous situations is one of the most beautiful and devastating  themes in the story.

1023420,5,6305438137,"When my Mother passed away, it was a shock, and I was very confused and frightened. I had no idea how to handle it or how I was even supposed to feel. I had a lot of sadness, and I didn't know what to do with any of it. The first time I ever saw The Thin Red Line was one week after I lost my Mother. The Thin Red Line is a war film, but it is an art film above all else. The Thin Red Line is 'a thought-provoking mediation on man, nature, and violence'. I had no idea what I was in for.

One of the very first pieces of dialogue is spoken by a character named Pvt. Witt.

He says, ""I remember my mother when she was dying, she was all shrunk up and grey. I asked her if she was afraid, she shook her head no. I was afraid to touch the death I seen in her. I couldn't find nothing beautiful or uplifting about her going back to God. I wondered what it'd be like when I died, to know that this was the last breath you was ever going to draw. I just hoped I could meet it with the same calm she did. Cause that's where it's hidden. The immortality I hadn't seen.""

The emotional toll this film would put me through would be immense, something I have never felt before or will ever feel again. The Thin Red Line spoke to me in a way a piece of art has never spoken to me before. Jim Caviezel, the actor who played Pvt. Witt, delivered a performance and created a character that changed my life. I have never identified closer with a film character before. 'Identified' isn't even the right word for it, an out-of-body experience is more accurate. It was unreal. The film had an almost therapeutic effect on me, without me even knowing it, I was sorting myself out. I was getting better.

The film itself is pure poetry, the film is brilliant. Terrence Malick's best. The ensemble cast the films boasts redefines the term 'star studded'. Jim Caviezel, Elias Koteas, Nick Nolte, John Travolta, George Clooney, John Cusack, Jared Leto, Nick Stahl, Adrien Brody, John C. Rielly, Woody Harrelson, and Sean Penn are only but a handful of the wonderful actors you will find in this film. The film displays the best use of voice-overs that I have ever seen. The Thin Red Line is a one-of-a-kind picture, and one that you must open yourself up to completely. Malick is a master of film, and The Thin Red Line is the strongest evidence to support that claim. The Thin Red Line will change the way you think about and view films. It will open your eyes to a whole new world of possibilities. That world is Malick's vision.

I am still in awe. What The Thin Red Line did for me is almost hard to completely grasp. It didn't make everything better, it is my girlfriend and my family who helped me finally heal. The Thin Red Line put me on the road to recovery, and that in and of itself is a wholly remarkable thing for a film to do for a person. The Thin Red Line changed me forever.

1023423,3,6305438137,"The circumstances around Terence Malick's THE THIN RED LINE are sometimes more talked about than the film itself. The reclusive director had made a big splash in the Seventies, but there followed two decades of silence. When he finally reappeared in 1998 to direct this adaptation of James Jones's novel about the Battle of Guadalcanal in World War II, many actors were desperate to work with him and he was able to gather a large ensemble cast. He shot over five hours of footage but had to cut it down to three, leaving out many actors entirely from the finished version.

THE THIN RED LINE tells of the American battle against Japanese forces on the island from the landing on its beach to the time the initial troops are relieved and sail off for some new, unknown deployment. But it actually begins shortly before this when Private Witt (Jim Caviezel), who has been AWOL and living with the local Melanesian people on a nearby island, is discovered by a patrol and brought in before his sargeant. The battle itself involves the men of C Company, 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division: besides Caviezel as Witt, major roles are played by Sean Penn, Woody Harrelson, Adrien Brody and Ben Chaplin. Elias Koteas is Capt. Staros, who tries to look out for his men, while a hyperbolic Nick Nolte plays their commander who sees the infantry as nothing but cannon fodder to wrecklessly throw at the Japanese.

For most of its 3-hour length, the men are torn apart by Japanese machine gun fire as they try to take a hill, but the enemy is never directly seen. Between scenes of great violence, there are portentous voiceovers by various characters as they meditate on what war says about the larger human drama. Eventually US forces are able to overcome Japanese positions, and the Japanese side of the offensive is depicted with more fairness and equanimity than in most American films on the Pacific Theatre of the war.

While the realistic depiction of battle might touch viewers -- and its hard to knock any World War II film since they spur one to read more about this crucial event in history, this is not a great film. It has obviously been cut heavily from its original length. John C. Reilly appears several times at the centre of shots, clearly meant to be a major character, but most of his scenes and all of his back story were cut. The philosophic voiceovers come across as pretentious instead of insightful. Furthermore, I find this a very ""Hollywood"" film, with the acting often exaggerated. Woody Harrelson doesn't play a WWII grunt, he plays Woody Harrelson. George Clooney appears at the end and all realism goes out the window: there's no way this suave, handsome leading man has been fighting a war for some time now. Hans Zimmer's musical score too obviously pulls the audience towards prescribed emotions.

I saw the Criterion Collection edition of THE THIN RED LINE consisting of two DVDs, the film on one and a extras on the other. Of the footage that Malick cut, we get to see four or five scenes totalling 13 minutes. There are also featurettes on the actors involved, the casting process, the editing of the film and then some historical news footage on Guadalcanal. That's a considerable amount of commentary and behind-the-scenes material, but those who feel so lukewarm about the film as I do may not find it so essential.",1367539200,3,3372,4.758974358974359

1023425,5,6305438137,"This is one of those movies where I hope today's generation drunk on crappy remakes, crappy reboots, gravity defying action soul crushing action flicks really takes a critical look at this movie. For those who do like those kind of movies watching this will be like taking a trip to the desert or a tropical jungle where danger lurks behind every bush. It will be as big a cinematic culture shock if there was any, and you just might come away surprised at what's in your head by the time the end credit rolls.

I saw this on the first day on the first showing in Union Square NYC, in my early 20's back in the fall of 1998 and this was post Saving Private Ryan which I thought nothing can beat it...until I saw TTRL. It's not the grandest action war movie ever made, but it is on par with Apocalypse Now as one of the most thoughtful and introspective films ever made about the nature of war and quite explicitly, nature itself. This is one of those movies where it is a singular piece of work. Nothing like it has come near it since its release. People always refer to Pulp Fiction or the Matrix or Fight Club being THE FILMS OF THE 90'S -- seriously those are great movies, but in the end they have limited replay value. When you've seen them a certain amount of times, you've hit the ceiling. There's nothing you can take away from them except for just being diverting time killers and saying to yourself ""oh that was fun"". Which is okay if that's all you want out of your entertainment. But sometimes I want art to challenge me. The Thin Red Line does that. It makes you question things. You're not just watching this, you're going through it.

The most interesting aspect is the various dialogues about the cynicism and unfairness of war in this world, ""the only world there is"". This is true of most wars of course, nothing specific about Guadalcanal. However, there is a scene at the beginning of the movie that seems to suggest otherwise: a couple of soldiers are stranded on an idyllic island with happy indigenous villagers.

In fact it's too bad there is precious little in the movie that tells you much about the Guadalcanal battle itself. Only scant reference is made to the historical context and the significance of this island in the early months of WW II. I would have liked additional historical facts to be relayed through the dialogues and battle scenes.

Try putting together a project like this. Once you realize how much effort goes into making films like these, you might not be so hyper critical. I found this film to be very moving and I think it says something when grown adults probably 20 or 30 years older than myself proclaim in all-caps that this film was boring and put them so sleep. Grow up. Not every film is supposed to be sheer entertainment. Films like these are intended to provoke emotion and allow for introspection and for you to maybe look at the world and the history of it a little differently. To appreciate your own fortunate circumstances, that you even have the luxury of experiencing something like The Thin Red Line instead of out in a jungle somewhere, killing other young human beings who never had this chance at life. Also, to those who claim this film has no basis in reality, it was based off an autobiographical novel by James Jones who experienced this sort of combat.

1023591,5,6305438137,"There are moments when greatness is immediately apparent. When I first watched Terrence Malick's 1998 film, The Thin Red Line, over a decade ago, it was clear that the film was great, and so was its director. Perhaps it was the opening shot of the film, wherein a crocodile slithers into muck as a rising fugue intones, that invoked a poetic realism that the rest of the nearly three hour film sustains. Or, perhaps, it was within the first 5 or 10 minutes, when the voiceover narration and watery images mixed into something rarely seen onscreen. Nonetheless, I immediately felt that sort of pleasure seep into one, knowing that this artist knows exactly what he is doing, and it will be something very good, or even better. And every time I've watched it since it reveals nuances not noticed before. That's a surefire marker of greatness. Oddly, the people I saw the film with disagreed, yet they had no real definitive reasons save the usual emotional response, or its lack. Upon rewatching the film, nothing has changed from my initial opinion. And given that this film was often spoken of in the same breath as Steven Spielberg's schlocksterpiece, Saving Private Ryan, shows how utterly clueless most critics, much less layfolk, are, for while both films were released in the same year, and cover the same war, the qualitative difference is immense.

The Thin Red Line ranks with Paths Of Glory and Apocalypse Now as amongst the greatest American war films ever made. It is a masterpiece that really has no flaws. And like Stanley Kubrick's final film, Eyes Wide Shut, released a year after this film, I was amongst the very few critics to immediately recognize its greatness, despite massive critical scorn (although the critical tide has belatedly turned in the correct favor). Sometimes prescience has its benefits. After all, as the film recognizes, sometimes it's all about the little moments, or just the little thoughts of bigger ones, that matter.",1339027200,4,1960,4.921450151057402

1023593,5,6305438137,"Terrence Malick's ""The Thin Red Line"" (1998) details the experiences of an American platoon during the battle of Guadalcanal in the SW Pacific during December/January 1942-43. The heart of the picture covers the taking of a grassy hill protected by Japanese bunkers; but that's only the surface of ""The Thin Red Line,"" as this isn't a normal war flick in the least.

The film features an all-star cast with cameos by the likes of John Travolta and George Clooney. Nick Nolte shines as the gung-ho Col. Tall, who wants to take the hill ASAP whatever the cost. This is his first war engagement and he lusts for glory. Meanwhile ""softhearted"" Capt. Staros (Elias Koteas) resists sending his men on an obvious suicide mission and insists on a less-costly strategy to taking the hill.

Some of the men are so defiled by the war that they can't feel anything anymore, for example Sgt. Storm, played by John Reilly, whereas a few haven't lost their spiritual bearings, like Pvt. Witt (Jim Caviezel); others are somewhere in between the darkness and the light, e.g. Sgt. Welsh (Sean Penn).

Other standouts include Ben Chaplin as Pvt. Bell, who's dearly devoted to a wife who may or may not deserve it (Miranda Otto); Dash Mihok as the incredibly courageous Pfc. Doll, who wildly leads the way in taking the bunkers; and John Cusack as the bold Capt. Gaff, who's simply speechless in the face of Col. Tall's asinine antics.

Other notables include Woody Harrelson, Adrien Brody, Jared Leto and Nick Stahl.

COMMENTARY: As noted above, ""The Thin Red Line"" is not a conventional war flick, so stay away if that's the type of movie you want to see. The battle of Guadalcanal is merely a stage for Malick to explore the nature of the human experience and, in fact, life itself. Why is nature at war with itself, from the smallest animals to people? Where does evil come from? What is love? Why do we feel it?  Who is the Divine? What is the nature of the Creator? Why are we poisoned by war? What is death and why do we fear it? For that matter, why do we have to die? How can we keep from being defiled by strife and war?

Malick shows both the beauty of the world and human existence as well as its horrors. We cannot change the way this world is and must therefore face the inevitable conflicts; the only thing we can control is our response to this ongoing war, like Caviezel's Pvt. Witt.

As you can see, the film explores the noblest and darkest reaches of the human heart and experience. As such, it's a picture that keeps giving no matter how many times you've watched it. In other words, it's full of hidden gems to glean with each viewing.

In contrast to the contemporaneous ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""The Thin Red Line"" has a slow start with an uneventful beach landing; it also has a mellow ending, but the center's full of brutal war horror even while its heart is deeply meditative and reverent. If that sounds like a bunch of mumbo jumbo, see the film and you'll understand what I mean. In the end ""The Thin Red Line"" towers alone in the annals of war cinema, a deeply spiritual triumph. There's really nothing else like it.

FYI: The film was shot on location in Guadalcanal, the Solomon Islands, and Australia and runs 2 hours, 50 minutes.

1023596,5,6305438137,"Terrence Malick is not a director for everyone.  He is far more poetic and artistic and experimental than your average director.  Malick is a true auteur.  He has a signature style, visual and fluid and spiritual.  He reminds me in a way of Wong Kar Wai.  His films speak volumes without technically `saying' a whole lot.  For me, I have films from him that I love, and then I have films from him that I don't think worked entirely well.  `The New World', while visually arresting, is disjointed and suffers from Malick's non-conventional approach; and while the critical world considers `The Tree of Life' a modern masterpiece, it is one of those few times when I feel that Malick's vision was lost in his inability to blend his ideas and his imagery.

But we're here to talk about `The Thin Red Line', which is possibly Malick's greatest cinematic achievement and, quite honestly, one of the greatest films ever made.

As I've expanded my cinematic knowledge, there was always one film that many of my cinephile friends continually placed in their top ten lists; `The Thin Red Line'.  I've always had an aversion to war films, mostly because I felt they seemed shallows and chaotic and repetitive.  They are also a dime a dozen.  There are just so many of them.  Sure, there are some great filmmakers who have elevated the genre and created some iconic films.  `Apocalypse Now', `Full Metal Jacket', `Platoon' and `Jarhead' are all marvelous films that get into the heart of war from a more personal and intimate nature.  Still, it took me a very long time to finally see `The Thin Red Line'.  I had seen Spielberg's `Saving Private Ryan', released the same year, and was far from impressed (lazy, scattered, shallow...yet beautifully framed and that initial sequence is a stunner).

Needless to say, I wasn't rushing to see Malick's film.

So that brings me to finally seeing this film.  Settling down for a night alone (such a rarity, and SO welcomed) I decided to give this DVD a spin.  It had been sitting on my entertainment center for the better part of a year (yes, I purchased it with all intentions set to watch it and yet, the best of intentions usually fail in this house) and so it was about time.  I'll just say this; from the opening images (Malick is such a master of visual interpretation) I was hooked.  I couldn't stop.  I didn't want to blink.  The film is that rapturous.  The film follows a scattered group of Marines during the battle of Guadalcanal.  Instead of giving us a straightforward action flick, Malick massages the intimacy of war; the emotional collapse of those stuck in the middle.  Using vivid imagery and beautifully poetic sequences, Malick coaxes out of his film a feeling of earthy longing.  He tugs at the core of us.  Many have dismissed this (so sad) because of the unconventional delivery, but to those who have embraced this film, it has become a shining gem.  Don't be fooled by the huge cast (the names on this cast list just keep coming), because this film BELONGS to Terrence Malick.  Sean Penn is fantastic in his few scenes, as is Elias Koteas, and Miranda Otto is stunning in her elongated flashback sequences.

If you are looking for a beautifully tailored film that uses war as a way to embellish the spiritual journey of self-discovery and the evolution of life itself.  Narrated with poetic discussions by emotionally wounded men, `The Thin Red Line' is not only one of the best war films ever made; this is one of the most poignant exercises in filmmaking...ever.",1336348800,,3522,4.711947626841244

1023649,4,6305438137,"After a 20 year absence, director/writer Terrence Malick returns with this adaptation of James Jones' novel.  If you are familiar with Malick you will not be surprised that this film about an American assault of Guadalcanal during WW II is not without contradictions.  The film opens with the main character, Pvt. Witt (Jim Caviezel) narrating over a halcyon scene where he frolics with the inhabitants of an island in the South Pacific.  It becomes evident that he and another of his buddies are AWOL from the Army.  They are eventually spotted by a Navy patrol boat and returned to their mother ship.  This peaceful beginning goes on for a while through some majestic footage shot by cinematographer John Toll.

It all changes as the uphill (literally) battle begins as ""C"" Company is charged with taking out a hilltop held by Japanese forces.  The company is led by Capt. Staros (Elias Koteas) and 1st Sgt. Welsh (Sean Penn) but the mission commander is Lt. Col. Tall (Nick Nolte), a career officer passed over for promotion in the past and pledging it won't happen again.  He sees this as an opportunity and is willing to sacrifice lives to accomplish his mission with a frontal assault.  As many lives are lost, Staros refuses orders to try again.  With an alternative attack, they eventually reach their goal but not without casualties both physical and mental.

Malick doesn't let up when the fighting begins.  It is brutal, gory and shows not only the courage on both sides but the viciousness of men.  The movie is overlong at 2 hours and 50 minutes.  Malick sometimes lingers too long on the faces of the men to get a reaction that sinks in.  The camera work is spectacular as scenes change from jungle to rivers to mountains and grassy fields.  It has a great cast supported by the likes of Ben Chaplin, John Cusack, Adrien Brody, John C. Reilly, Woody Harrelson, John Travolta and George Clooney (the latter two in cameos).  Hans Zimmer's score is terrific and punctuates the scenes perfectly.  In a year that also saw ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""The Thin Red Line"" secured 7 Oscar nominations including Malick (directing & screenplay), Toll and Zimmer among them.

I would add a word of caution for those search for a non-stop action based war film.  This isn't it.  Malick is known to give balance to his films.  Here he balances the brutality of war with serene moments, poetic voice-overs and thoughtful long pauses.  Still it is one of the great war films.",1330905600,2,2469,4.77122641509434

Good:  I liked the cinematic production.  The combat footage is rather good, and from time to time the tactics are also reasonably accurate.  However, it has huge gaping hole such as: they call in artillery fire, pummel the place, then find out there is a machine gun nest still active and rather than calling in more artillery fire, they decide to make a frontal assault with pistols - crazy.

Bad: Music, way too much of ""sad epic music"" this movie tries to recreate the feeling of Saving Private Ryan or Last of the Mohicans and fails badly. Namely they play slow music and show fast action.

Very poor plot line, I still have no idea what the plot of this movie is.

This movie seems to be produced by someone with an ""anti-war"" agenda using sad and wornout sterotypes of the military and little to no understanding of combat.

A title taken from movies and books about the British army in other parts of the world and time in which they were few in number but were able to bring about events not thought likely with their few numbers in comparison with their foes.  But, this movie is not about this kind of strength and heroism for the American Forces in the Pacific during World War II.  The movie seems to be made for the basic anti-war, liberal, feel-good pacifist, nature lover person.  This movie is an example of how this kind of thinking and emotions, no matter what war or the situation have to present a war of one person who is a sensitive person, like the main Character, ""All Quiet on the Western Front,"" who can't keep from going AWOL because he has to experience the original ""innocent, peaceful, non-aggressive"" native in an all natural environment.  In this way the director makes a statement about industrialized, developed countries like America, which is basically negative.  This person is played against a 1st Sergeant who only cares about running his company and has not emotions for anything or anybody.  This movie did not fail because it came out at the wrong time, the same time as ""Saving Private Ryan.""

I was profoundly moved and terribly shaken after viewing it twelve years ago and it's effect has not waned, if not intensified.  There is nothing formulaic about this ""war film"", if it can even be categorized as such.  Sometimes their are brief inhuman glimpses of the Battle for Guadalcanal and touching human flashbacks to the personal life of the film's protagonist.  Then there are intensely focused images of this brutal chapter in the Battle for the Pacific. I believe this film and other dramatizations like the recent miniseries ""The Pacific"" that aired on HBO are vital viewing for those who wish to gain some level of understanding about the men who sacrificed themselves to a cause that meant something unique to each and every soldier on that tiny island that held such stategic value and claimed the lives of so many selfless and heroic men.  These men were truly ""The Last Great Generation"" and this film is a fitting and emotional tribute to the those who served and died on that small isolated patch of land located in the middle of a vast ocean on the other side of the world from their homes and loved ones.",1329264000,,1545,4.568840579710145
1023655,4,6305438137,"The Thin Red line is really a movie about humanity, the war simply being the catalyst to bring out a myriad of traits in the characters. The story telling here is very unconventional, but poetic and beautiful, leaving you valuing life by the end. As an examination of humanity, this movie is wonderful and must be seen for it. The monologues delivered by the main characters are very philosophical and interesting to listen to. Just don't expect a lot of war cliches and drawn out battle sequences. What combat is shown here is gritty, focusing more on hell the men endure rather than gritty realism. The war scenes do have some major issues when compared to Saving Private Ryan, especially when it comes to the characterization of the American and Japanese soldiers, but on the whole it is good.

However, this film as a whole is very hit and miss. Most importantly, it is too long. By too long, I don't mean how many hours it is - a 20 minute film can be too long if the pacing is off. This film builds up to multiple climaxes and then falls off a cliff before managing to save itself by the very end. I'm all for unconventional methods of telling a story, but in this film there are many points that simply meander without any point. Though many of the monologues were introspective and revealing of a character, others were completely unnecessary and had no purpose, not to mention many sequences of dialogue that don't go anywhere.

On the whole, the heart and soul of this film is what matters, however it can be quite a chore to sit through with such haphazard pacing.",1328832000,2,1575,4.542253521126761

1023743,5,6305438137,"Criterion's Blu-Ray offers a gorgeous rendition of The Thin Red Line, a film that demands to be seen in the best conditions possible.  The difficult but beautiful film that marked the re-emergence of Terrence Malick after a 20-year absence was met with some critical acclaim, but also a lot of confusion.  Heralded as an epic war film, it was compared (unfavorably, at least in the box office) to the much more conventional&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saving-Private-Ryan/dp/B003LL3N1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saving Private Ryan</a>, but its treatment of war itself is secondary to its reflection on war's impact on the inner lives of a number of soldiers, and on the outer world of nature that appeared indifferent to the violence and chaos that threw human lives into disarray.

One thing that perplexed reviewers when it first came out was its unconventional narrative arc, and its apparent lack of focus.  Rather than focus on a single campaign or a single set of characters, the film attends to a wide number of the men who formed part of the Charlie Company that took part in the battle for Guadalcanal, and covers not only an initial campaign but its aftermath and its implications.  What gives it unity, to my mind, is the special attention the film gives to three relationships, each of which exemplifies one of the primary motivations that tend to drive human beings: honor and respect, love and desire, and truth and wisdom.

Colonel Tall (Nick Nolte) sees the war as a chance finally to prove himself and achieve the promotions he'd been denied for so long.  He comes into conflict with Captain Staros (Elias Koteas) who is unwilling to sacrifice his men to his superior's ambition.  Private Bell (Ben Chaplin) finds meaning in the memories of the beautiful wife he left behind.  An improbable philosophical friendship develops between the cynical captain Welsh, and the apparently care free and thoughtful Private Witt.

It's a gorgeous film, with an all-star cast that's outshined by the incredible imagery.  In both his employment of natural images and his signature use of voiceover, Malick raises questions about the relation between the ""war at the heart of nature"" and war as a characteristic activity of all men.  Essential viewing.  (Sadly, we don't get any interviews with Malick on this set - and there's a more comprehensive behind-the-scenes documentary on the disc for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-New-World/dp/B000ESSUL4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The New World</a>, which only ever shows Malick from behind, but you do get a strong indirect sense of the man and how he works in the fairly extensive set of interviews with several actors from the film, such as Sean Penn, Elias Koteas and Jim Caviezel.

 It is the wick which represents God and the Candle itself represents life.  But it is the Blue Flame that touches the wick, that burns the hottest, that shows the greatest purity.  The outer yellow/orange flame, burns, or warms, or gives light, but the blue flame brings the peace, the perspective,the faithfulness that PVT Witt showed.

It is the blue flame that gets its strength from the Almighty, It is the blue flame that represents true love, true life, true hope, true strength.  but next to the Blue Flame is a THin Red Line, which represents sacrifice.

In the case of this movie, it was the blood spilled in the war.

That is the quality that Sean Penn had, but did not recognize, yet still desired.

Is your blue flame lit?  Can you recognize and nurture the blue flame in others?

If not ask the (Wick) God to light it in your heart.  Remember, Jesus, was the original spark, that came to fight the darkness that War so greatly represents.

His Blood, created a Thin Red Line from heaven to earth.  From God to Man.  That is what this movie was about.  They were all seeking to understand the Thin Red Line within their own spiritual understanding. If they could understand the ""bloodline"" they could then understand the Blue Flame of real love, peace, and the Almighty.

I rank it with ""Saving Private Ryan,"" but with this difference:  ""Ryan"" is so terribly effective that, having seen it once, I don't need or wish to see it again.  ""Red Line"" is so effective in its visual, sensory-overload way that I *will* watch it again.  I will give it a year and come back to it.  This is how I treat the movies and novels I like best.

This is a lyrically visual film.  The camera alternately lingers on sunlight filtering through foliage overhead (wait for it: At the beginning of an experience and at the end of a life) and races at eye level through the tall grass between infantrymen and an unseen enemy trying to kill them.  We see that enemy almost through the aperture of an M1's backsight.  We see fleeting glimpses of terror and animal reaction, and of the brief relief of short, temporary victory.  We see the failure of courage and the unexpected apotheosis of it.

There are sharply-drawn character sketches, and characters that may surprise.  It may be said that these are imperfect, being too sharply drawn.  For myself, I think this movie surpasses ""Private Ryan"" in this regard.  You choose.",1318032000,2,1273,4.546255506607929

1023813,5,6305438137,"What can I say about The Thin Red Line? It breaks all the rules of story telling by taking a well written novel on war with a dozen major characters,while using the characters,he bypasses what is their narrative,with a musing upon the nature of existence,turning it into a mainstream-defying non-narrative artfilm:expansive, all-embracing,Whitmanesque;an epic using Guadalcanal and the Pacific War as a defiantly free-associative lyric on man's fraught relationship to nature. Quoting from literary works like Bahgvad-Gita,The Iliad,The Grapes of Wrath,he infuses myths into the lifeblood of the film's imagery,giving it primacy,beauty and poetry,not plots and characters,presenting unmediated,uninterpreted reality. We get cutaways(witness the struggling baby bird),dreamtime soundtrack reveries,found phenomena,disconnected combat episodes and explicit metaphysical enquiry,achieving the creation of a cinema with a truly communal voice. This is a portrait of humankind not tied to one figure in the flow of Malik's movie,yet we're one with them all. As the multi-voiced narration says over and over in different ways,in this case by way of Caviezel's Private Witt,""Maybe all men got one big soul everybody's a part of,all faces are the same man.""

He tossed away the straight narrative adaptation(transitions,expository scenes), filling the film with an elegiac,epiphanic symphony. Are we getting the psychological reality of the filmmaker or the characters?We experience the world as a groundless source of mystery. The characters present the world in all its variety,as something to be faced with reverence. Reality shaping itself through conflict and struggle.""What's this war in the heart of nature?""War/nature are both cosmic and local. The soldiers ask ""where does(something)come from"",not as a demand for a causal explanation,but as the expression of a certain craving that the explanation cannot satisfy. Voiceover narrations set up a series of oppositions between individual and collective. The voiceovers are read by different characters, but not necessarily by the ones that are onscreen while the lines are uttered. Also the flashbacks and subjective mental images are indistinguishable from objective, corporeal images e.g.the scene between Tall(Nolte) and the general(Travolta) or the scene when Bell (Chaplin) is musing and the shot of his wife standing by herself disrupted by a figure of a man in military uniform;is he Bell as he imagines himself or some projection of his fear(of her infidelity),or is it about what really happens to her?The film's weakness is its verbosity:no commitment to character or drama of men in war or as a philosophical enquiry,but it has a fascinating combination of different impulses and motivations. I thought the performances of Nolte,Penn,Caviezel and Eleas Koteas were all astounding. That Malik exists in America is what is astonishing.

1023814,3,6305438137,"Well, this is the last time I buy a Criterion film based on their evaluation of which ones deserve their technical expertise. This film overstates the feelings of the combat experience and, therefore, is unrealistic. Notice one detail as an example: When the Marines rush the Japanese machinegun bunker on the hill, they rather handily kill each individual Japanese soldier coming at them with one shot. Now, that ain't real.
Saving Private Ryan is superior in my opinion. It also touches on the emotional aspects of combat but is subtle about it, and so, is real. For instance, when the Captain, Tom Hanks, foolishly decides to take the radio antennas and they lose their medic in the ensuing fight, that death scene is exceptionally realistic. And the carnage on Omaha Beach is probably as realistic as anything I've ever seen. I recall thinking when the Germans opened up on them from their bunkers, ""Wow, that's the first time in a movie that I've heard the concussion of a gun that sounds anything like what I remember from my basic training days.""
I'm inclined to think Malick's goal was admirable and he used several good actors, but he overstated the case.",1307750400,6,1164,4.825
1023815,5,6305438137,"A cursory glance at a scene or two of The Thin Red Line might fool someone into thinking this is a conventional, expensively produced blockbuster war movie, full of visual spectacle, name brand actors, and historically precise set details. For that reason, it's posters, critical raves, and trailer could easily induce a Saving Private Ryan, Platoon, and Full Metal Jacket loving public to give it a try and then slam it as three hours of portentous tedium. Clearly, those who watch with conventional expectations for war movies are bound to be confused and disappointed.

However, that doesn't mean that The Thin Red Line is a cinematic failure, as even some very good critics imply. In Malick's vision, war is not a question of morality--who is good and who is bad--or psychology--who is crazy or sane. Malick is looking for something deeper--the roots of war in the order of nature itself. While a crocodile lurks in a river, a soldier's inner speech is voiced-over: ""What's this war at the heart of nature?"" Later the question is re-stated this way: ""Does our ruin benefit the earth? Does it help the grass to grow, the sun to shine?""

Lovingly photographed in exquisite detail, the beauty of the Solomon Islands and their indigenous inhabitants provides a powerful backdrop for these questions. Perhaps to the frustration of many, a good answer to these recurrent inner questions is beyond the reach of cinematic presentation, and indeed beyond the reach of thought itself, but Malick gestures aptly with his choice of a theme song, a Christian hymn sung acapella in Melanesian pidgin.

The words, only intelligible to a tiny minority, sung in a language that itself was born in the violence of colonial and religious imperialism, gesture to a spiritual realization that transcends the historical accident that gave it a particular form.

""I've seen another world"" says Private Witt, the AWOL soldier who lived with these singing Melanesians, to his sargent upon being tracked down and brought back to the battle.

Terrence Malick wants us to see this world too, but can't force it to happen. He can only gesture to the profound mystery of its imminence, which has the miraculous power of revealing itself most clearly at times, like war, of violence and suffering.",1303430400,3,2270,4.994708994708994

Interestingly, in this conflict it is only the indigent tribes that stay indifferent to all fighting and bombing that happens.

But whether ""real GIs acted that way"" is really not the point--in this movie the fact that these men are soldiers fighting a war is just the backdrop to getting into these guys' heads.  TRL is just guys immersed in a horrible situation, trying to just get through it, and a few were trying to figure out what the experience was doing to them.

1023922,3,6305438137,"Terrence Malick is rightly a genius of film. But this particular film was a not a good work. The reasons for its failure are not all his and the craft of the film is excellent. But ultimately it is what is....

The book on which the film is was written by James Jones who also wrote ""From Here to Eternity"". And the book is some sense a sequel to that work. It follows the Regular American army out of Pearl Harbor onto Guadalcanal. The strength of the book as the fiction are the human portraits of ordinary soldiers that it creates. Its weakness is that Janes Jones often played fast-and-loose with the truth. The book is in some respects close to the truth but in others quite far away. Its fiction but its so closely shadowing real events and real people that the author is himself riding on a thin line.

The film does a terrible job of describing the situation of the battle being portrayed. The marines had done the initial serious fighting for Gaudalcanal long before the army (as shown in the film) arrived. The battle had essentially been won before the film starts. The army is conducting a mopping up operation to capture a series of remote ridges from which the Japanese could harass the american airfield already established on the Island. The first American landing had been in August. The film takes place in December. The director fails to capture two important basic facts: (1) The battle in the film has no particular great signficance. Its just an ordinary thing that happened. (2) By the time of the battle, the Japanese on the Island were on their last legs. They were sick, short of food and lacking in almost everything.

The worst performance in the film is by Nick Nolte. He compounds the slanders of the book on the real ""Colonel Tall"" by turning him into a cartoon character. This is a character based on a real person with a real history that can be examined. The least the director could have done was to research the real people that Company Clerk James Jones based his book on. The story deserved something more subtile that just using Company Clerk Jones' ""my company right or wrong"" defense of his own failed commander and villification of ""Tall"".

This could have been a great work if the director had stepped back from the pure book and given a broader historic perspective to the individuals involved. The strength of Jones is that he captures the war from the viewpoint of the bottom. But that brings a weakness to the film in that often faulty perspective of the bottom becomes fact in the telling. To reach greatness, the film needed to show the misunderstandings and different perspectives of war that different people involved have. They needed to reach both into the book and into the historical record to come up with a script. But it didn't happen.

Adapting the book was going to be problematical in that there was no practical way to capture all of the different individuals and their voices from the book. The director apparently tried really hard to do that, but he ended up with an unwatchably confusing and overly long film which was severely cut down in the editing. its also a shame given how much was cut that they kept a long boring jungle paradise scene at the beginning. The cutaways to the girl at home also seemed not all that useful.

One thing, above all else needed, was to show the marines who had been fighting on the Island coming off the Island as wrecks as the film begins. That alone would have set events in perspective.

But for all the shortcomings of the film, its an incredible technical work on some levels. It looks good. There is an enormous attention to detail in the production and the construction of scenes. Everything seems more than faithful to the period. And the actors do a good job with the flawed material they are given.

The only area I didn't like is that the war (as usual) was enhanced to be better than real life. Ammunition is expended at unrealistic rates without any resupply. Shells landing don't look like shells. And so on.

The mistakes in the film were not in Terrence Malick's direction or the acting. Ultimately the mistakes were in using a very problematic book as source material and attempting to use that book faithfully when another approach would have been better.",1297555200,6,4273,4.62664907651715

Its all very beautifully done to me, and it speaks to the big picture of nature and the human condition.

I simply cannot believe that. Terrence Malick created a masterpiece, unlike anything that I have ever seen before. It is simply beautiful. There are scenes from this film that will haunt me forever. This is a sprawling epic with magnificent performances from all involved, especially Jim Caviezel, who was a new face at the time. Watching this film now, it is hard to believe that he wasn't nominated for his work. Nick Nolte gives the performance of his career, right behind his work in The Prince of Tides. There are several cameos from big name actors here, but they all contribute to the film, and it is not distracting. This is a work of art. Films like THE THIN RED LINE are the reason that I love movies in the first place. This is what I want when I enter a theatre. I want to be moved, and this film did exactly that, many times over.

To those who ""didn't get it"", well, this film isn't for you. Rent Transformers or The Bounty Hunter, and maybe you'll get your adrenaline fix, since that's all that you require in order to be entertained.

Malick delves into the mind's eye of the protagonists and unapologetically meanders though scenes like poetry.  But as an earlier reviewer commented, you either love his style or hate it.

This is only the beginning of the abject presentism in this film.  No fewer than three times does the film state that Guadalcanal was of no strategic value but was only a battle fought so high-ranking officers could get undeserved medals.  As a historian, I'm disgusted by this rewriting of history.  The American soldiers in the movie spend most of their time weeping while the only honorable individuals are the Japanese soldiers.  It's insulting to the memory of US soldiers who fought in World War II, and it's an assault on truth.  I made the mistake of paying to watch this movie in a theatre.

The island of Guadalcanal wasn't filled with tall mountains and lush valleys and was bombed into dirt before the battle.  Watch some documentaries or interviews with survivors and you'll see that the depiction of the soldiers here is ridiculous.  They didn't sit around sniveling and moaning and pondering the philosophical meaning of good and evil.  The film moves at a glacial pace and doesn't make you care if the soldiers live or die.  Great war movies like 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'We Were Soldiers' get inside the heads of their soldiers and reveal them to be ordinary people thrust into the Hell of war, while at the same time giving us tense action and brutal battle scenes.

In 1998 he resurfaced with THE THIN RED LINE, an adaptation of James Jones's 1962 novel set during the battle for Guadalcanal.

Equally loved and hated, this is much more than an epic war movie; it is also a deeply philosophical meditation on man, nature (God?) and violence.

Beautifully photographed, the images reflect the surreal, often transcendent tone of the films deeper meaning.  Hyper-real sensual images of the natural world abound - the world that surrounds and in effect embraces the pain of war.

I read and posted on the various fora, sent the emails, re-tweeted the enigmatic and happy Twitpic that Criterion posted, jumped all over the Criterion newsletter when they came out with their gnomic icon confirmation.  I got the Blu-Ray the day it dropped, and have spent the subsequent couple days in a kind of reverie.  I just watched the film -- which is, full stop for effect, absolutely STUNNING in Blu-Ray.  Every technical aspect, from the color to the surround-sound (I so love the use of Charles Ives' ""The Unanswered Question"" in the middle of a battlefield atrocity), is reference-quality AWESOME.  I've yet to experience the commentary, but I've watched the insightful feature on James Jones and the novel from his daughter and listened to the chants; there's still the 15 deleted scenes and the wartime newsreels on Guadalcanal to go through, plus some other extras I'm sure.  The essay is wonderful.  If you think you experienced a religious ecstasy the first time you saw The Thin Red Line, just experience it again on this Criterion Blu-Ray and undergo true cinematic rapture.

** UPDATE ** I've watched all of the extra features, which are uniformly insightful and superb.

Commentary: This is by cinematographer John Toll, production designer Jack Fisk, and producer Grant Hill.  Criterion commentaries are usually of three breeds, I find: hit-or-miss commentaries by film scholars (Peter Cowie's Bergman commentaries would be hits, the dull ""you see the door in that shot? that door represents an opening"" commentary on Solaris would be a miss), idiosyncratic commentaries by directors (Edward Yang, Jim Jarmusch), and then incredibly detailed production commentaries by people who worked on the production (The Last Metro, both Malicks).  I like the director commentaries the most, since they usually combine both interpretation and production stories.  The Thin Red Line commentary is completely about the production of the film, suffused with an almost worshipful regard for Terrence Malick.  I found it a little dry.  I would've liked discussion about, say, the poetry of the film -- the beautiful scene of Witt's mother dying, for example, which is like a Renaissance painting.  Instead you hear that that scene was one of the last ones filmed.

Actors: An almost 30 minute featurette, featuring interviews with Sean Penn, Kirk Acevedo, Thomas Jane, Elias Koteas, Dash Mihok and Jim Cavaziel.  I didn't find this particularly interesting; the actors uniformly fawn over Malick's genius and basically congratulate themselves for participating in the film.

Casting: A twenty minute featurette with the casting director, Diane Crittenden, featuring many audition tapes.  Pretty interesting to see now well-known actors audition in the beginning of their careers (Nick Stahl, especially).  Thomas Jane was quite the rockabilly.

Music: Hans Zimmer talks about his ambitious (he calls it ""pretentious"") ideas for the soundtrack of the film, particularly the idea that the music ""should keep asking questions.""  I didn't realize that Zimmer had done the thoughtful music for Thin Red Line: it's so different from the sonic bombasts he's been doing lately.

Editing: Malick's team of editors, Billy Weber, Leslie Jones and Saar Klein discuss their work on their film.  I found this feature to be the most interesting of the lot, particularly their discussion of how Malick pared the original 5-hour cut of the film (which, according to them, was plot-heavy, expository and filled with dialogue) into its current form, which is essentially a silent film layered with voiceover.  Apparently Malick watched the assemblies with the soundtrack out, listening instead to Green Day.  Who knew Terrence Malick liked Green Day?

Deleted Scenes: These fourteen minutes of deleted scenes show what a different movie The Thin Red Line could have been: they're basically straightforward dialogue and action scenes, with little or no voiceover or music.  One of the events that actually happened to James Jones that he put into the novel -- he was surprised by an enemy soldier while taking a crap, and managed to kill him -- turns out to have been filmed after all. Another scene shows George Clooney displaying some fine actorly chops.

Kaylie Jones: James Jones' daughter talks about her father and the writing of The Thin Red Line in an illuminating featurette.

Newsreels: Ten 2-minute newsreels from 1942 talk about the American involvement in the Solomon Islands and Guadalcanal in an incredibly gung-ho, Celebrate Our Boys fashion.  It's an amazing counterpoint to the film.

Melanesian chants: Audio-only feature on the native chants used in the film.

Trailer: Watch this after you've seen the film, since like most trailers it completely gives everything away.",1285804800,135,4910,5.2378516624040925
1023999,4,6305438137,"1)Malick is a great director. I've seen all of his movies. My favorite Malick film is New world followed by The Thin Red Line, Days of Heaven and last but not least Badlands.
2)The Criterion Thin Red Line was worth the wait. The Blue Ray version is awesome.
3)Do not expect a Private Ryan or Halls of Montezuma,this is a Malick flick,which means your gonna have to think a bit and get philosophical,because you are going to be bombarded by exquisite cinematic imagery,and characterizations that relay a unrealized, not so specific,gray area,point of view on war,men in war,and nature in war. Malick is not going to spell everything out for you,that's the whole deal with Malick,there's a strangness about his films that is captivating,and sublime.
4)I could have done without the cameos butthe acting is great.
5)I wish the Criterion edition would have added sme of the footage missing from Malick's original 6 hr version. My nephew saw the 6hr version,and said it was much better than the 170 minute chopped up theatrical version. I know many say the 170 minute version of TTRL is too long,but I,(as in all of Malicks films)see each frame visually poetic,and stylistic,they come together and the movie plays out with artistic abandon,purposely surreal,TTRL leaves you asking questions rather pushing you toward a specific sonclusion.
6)I have read some pretty negative reviews on TTRL,by amazon movie watchers,and when I first saw TTRL I was not that impressed with Malick's ww2 vision,but the more I watched it the better it got,today I really like this film. The Criterion version makes it even better. Malick is not presumptuous enough to question why there is war,or why men can kill other men rather he gives us an island somewhere in an emerald sea,with a native people,life bearing nature,2 armies of armed and commanded soldiers,all making war and death on each other,and all we can do is watch.
7)I wish Criterion would do ONE EYED JACKS--there is not a decent version (DVD)of Brando's great western anywhere to be had...",1285718400,4,2031,4.976470588235294
1024040,4,6305438137,"The Criterion Collection has released a superb 2-disc edition of Terrence Malick's 1998 film adaptation of James Jones' novel of World War II.

I first saw the film in a theater when it was first released, then later again on an earlier DVD release.

I know that a lot of people think that this is the greatest war movie ever made but, unfortunately, I'm not one of them.

Yes, visually it is absolutely stunning and it has some powerful scenes and terrific performances (e.g. Nick Nolte, Elias Koteas, John Savage).

However, if any movie could afford to lose 30-45 minutes of its running time, this is it.

As in all of Malick's movies, the nature shots are fantastic, yet its dramatic structure is almost non-existent.  A story about an Army company and its many members might work very well in a novel, but a screenplay has a definite structure that a writer must adhere to if it is going to work.

I know the movie is about the battle for Guadalcanal, just like GONE WITH THE WIND was about the Civil War.

But, what's the movie version of THE THIN RED LINE really about?

Who is its protagonist?

So many characters appear, and then disappear (sometimes without explanation), throughout the film, which makes that a difficult question to answer.

""War is Hell and it destroys the tranquility of nature.""

I assume that that is one of the messages that Malick is trying to convey.  But then, as illustrated by one of the film's opening shots, nature can be pretty brutal, too.

I have nothing against a film having a philosophical bent, but not if it's going to sacrifice good storytelling.

On the other hand, Criterion's new transfer for this film is magnificent, and they've also included their usual array of first-rate extras, including audio commentary by cinematographer John Toll and others, interviews with many of the cast members and production staff, deleted scenes, audition tapes, a very informative and touching interview with James Jones' daughter, WW II newsreels of Guadalcanal and much more.  Additionally, there is a 38-page booklet, filled with essays about the picture.

If you like this movie, then this is certainly the edition to own.

Then a native man strolls past armed soldiers giving the true impression of a soul untouched by the fear, the anger and threat of war. We are shown beauty amidst horror and sheer terror that these men feel in a mad world. Mallick's camera cruises past barracks and young, strong bodies who express their thoughts of fear, frustration and regret. In one moment there's quiet contemplation and then sudden images of violence and explosive chaos.

The camera's intensity matches the soldiers' heartbeats in this wonderful film. The Thin Red Line is a meditation on the human condition during battle; men who have been to war, generation after generation facing the inevitable and the non-enviable. Who decided the solution to conflict is this inhumane mess? Mallick asks these questions to which have never been answered to this day.

Worst of all, this movies is SLOOWWWWWW! The emphasis is needed here. There are way too many dramatic death scenes and not enough action. Also, there are way too many scenes of people just sitting around. I understand this is supposed to be a work of fiction, but this is an utter waste of time and does little to honor the true heroic actions of the men who fought and died during the battle for Guadalcanal.

1024044,2,6305438137,"I'll preface this review, and try not to sound like a complete rube, by saying that I've seen one other Malick movie, The New World, about a year before this one, and absolutely loved that.  However, everything that worked for that movie did not work for this movie.  The long, lingering shots of trees and animals made sense in The New World, since it's ostensibly a movie about man's relationship to the world;  in this movie, those same shots just seem ponderous and unnecessary.

There are those who would say that this is not a ""war movie"", and I'll grant them that.  However, I'd say that this barely even qualifies as a ""movie"".  There are no main characters, and there is no narrative.  After 3 hours, I could name a single character, one of the two whose backstories are told.  Plus, the number of big-name actors in this is distracting to the point of ridiculousness.  While some, like Sean Penn and Nick Nolte, are excellent, having recognizable people like John Cusack and John C. Reilly randomly enter then exit the film really takes you out of the movie.

Apparently, Malick originally shot about 6 hours of movie, but cut it down to 3 hours (and completely cut out an additional half-dozen big-name actors).  The entire movie, I felt like I was watching something less than a whole, some arbitrary subset of scenes edited together, often seemingly out-of-order, that were just incomplete glimpses of characters and subplots that might've been better developed in a longer version.

Ultimately, I found this movie very frustrating.  I loved The New World, and really wanted to love this, especially with so many bits of greatness and beauty.  But then those bits would be followed by scenes like a random George Clooney cameo at the very end of the movie, and I'd immediately remember why I wasn't enjoying it.  If I want to watch a movie about WW2, I'll gladly watch Saving Private Ryan (which is apparently still cool to bash 12 years later) or its HBO miniseries equivalents.  If I want to get high and watch 3 hours of jungle footage, with soldiers and their poetic thoughts randomly walking through, I'll watch this.",1282262400,9,2135,4.760869565217392

1024048,4,6305438137,"1998's ""The Thin Red Line"" marked the return to movie-making of Director Terrence Malick.  The result is a long movie about the bloody 1942 Battle for Guadalcanal in the South Pacific of the Second World War, with a parade of good actors and a thoughtful but perhaps incomplete meditation about the nature of violence in war.

Under Malick's direction, the camera wanders around a chaotic battlefield, as the Marines and the Japanese battle for control of the jungle.  The action can be extremely intimate and challenging, as characters live and die.  To the extent that there is a plot, it follows the efforts of an ambitious Marine Corps Major (Nick Nolte) to secure a key piece of high ground, even at the cost of many casualties.  To the extent that there is a theme, it may be the unspoken contrast between an idealistic, almost Christ-like private (Jim Cavezial) and a cynical Sergeant (Shawn Penn).  Lots of other name actors get short cameos on screen.

""The Thin Red Line"" is good cinema, and may be best appreciated by fans of Terrence Malick's style of film-making; it is recommended to that audience.",1275004800,,1112,4.821052631578947
1024049,5,6305438137,"This is one of those movies in your collection that you always knew would pop off the screen on blu ray. The lush greens of the Guadalcanal landscape, the crystal clear, blue waters that surround the island chain. The main battle scenes are on that tall, grassy hill side set against the bright rays of the sun. The contrast of the exploding shells upon the thick greens of the terrain. This is the perfect movie for blu ray! This is one of my favorite Pacific war movies. Its often been one of those movies people either love or hate. A lot of people couldn't get used to the soldiers thoughts away from the field, which was a momentary escape from the horrors of the battle. And these thoughts are shown, pausing the battle for a moment. There are a handful of these fantasy sequences. Other folks don't care for the narratives given by the young soldier at the beginning. ""What is this war?"" etc..Nick Nolte also has some reflections, but it adds to the movie in my opinion. He has eyes upon him, Travolta warns hin earlier. If you give the film a chance it developes into a gritty, brutal war epic. The battle scenes are very well done. The soldiers try several times to attack from the front, but the Japanese have a bunker and machine gun nests on the top of the ridge and rain  hell down on the Americans. Some of the soldiers go mad.

The cast is surprisingly chock full of name brand actors. Sean Penn, John Cusack, George Clooney, Nick Nolte, Woody Harrelson, John Travolta etc. But make no mistake Nick Nolte is the star here. The scene of the movie for me is when  Lt. Col Tall( Nolte) is on the radio with Capt Staros(Elias Koteas). Nolte wants Staros to commit all men at hand on a frontal assault. Staros refuses "" I will not send my men to their death"" . He suggests a flanking move, but Nolte will have none of that talk.  The following is great- Nolte without saying a word goes crazy with rage, tries to compose himself and then goes off on Staros. Its well done. Another scene that is not to be forgotten- The Japanese are finally over run and some are captured as prisoners. The utter anger and shame the Japanese feel is captured very well here. The ultimate disgrace to Japan and the emperor is on their minds- they have failed their country. Its the worst thing a Japanese soldier can do- to not die on the battlefield, but get captured.

A small detail thats in this movie that adds a little is the scenes with the natives on the island. These people were very helpful in the real battle as imformants to the Americans. In the real battle, Japanese ace pilot Saburo Sakai shoots down American ace Pug Sutherland. His plane crashes on Guadalcanal and he eventually gets the help of natives, who help him back to his fellow Americans. So to see these people in the film is cool.

IMHO, TTRL is one of the greatest films ever made.  I saw it twice the first week it was released in 1998 in a theatre and have watched it on standard DVD many times since.  I cannot wait to see it again in HD on Blu-ray especially since it is also one of the most visually beautiful films ever made.  It is not only a great war film, but a great spiritual poem that pays tribute to life in all of its forms on our planet.  It will never be as popular as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (released the same year), but great art is never embraced by a mass audience.  To tell you the truth, I don't have much faith in the general public's taste or intelligence, the popularity of TRANSFORMERS is just one of many examples.  I have been waiting for TTRL to be released on Blu-ray while so many inferior films are released in this format every week and it will be worth the wait because Criterion deserves its reputation as the best home video company for film buffs.  I do not expect an audio commentary by Malick, because even more than Stanley Kubrick, he has avoided the press, so his films speak for themselves, he leaves it up to the viewer to interpret them.  As much as I have loved and grown used to the original theatrical cut of TTRL over the years, I would not mind seeing a longer version (there are two versions of Malick's THE NEW WORLD on DVD), but I am happy enough to know that thanks to Criterion, I will be able to see a beautiful HD transfer of TTRL at the very least.

I've seen a lot of films.  Technically, the film is moderately good -- nice scenery, good cinematography, lighting, composition and so on.  The overall plot is very poor, however.  There's something goofy and very strange in the way it was put together, kind of disjointed and ethereal. There are some scenes that are well acted and others that are really crap, but overall it's just a collection of appearances by actors.  The whining and ruminating by voiceover drones on and on.  I had a friend in college who talked like this.  At first it was kind of interesting but within a very short time I found myself avoiding him.  He eventually cracked up and left school.

1024125,5,6305438137,"Is this movie superior to the vastly popular Saving Private Ryan? It's like comparing night and day. I like both movies on their own merits, it is unfortunate this got released a few month after SPR, and went unnoticed... this movie is pure cinematic poetry caught on film. It's a very layered film dealing with such topics as life, death, duality of man, what is right, what is wrong, who is right who is wrong, why  do we do horrible things to other human beings, what is war, why is it hell. What is the thin red line? Is it that line delicately balancing sanity, insanity, life and death, morality, immorality, isolation/ companionship. That war corrupts the mind, the soul and ultimately nature. Each character shares their thoughts throughout the film through voice over narrative. A war film that addresses these issues, where SPR went down the other road, a war movie strictly using ""men on a mission"" technique, American Patriotism with a hint of war is futile.

There are some very breath taking scenes, the way Malick captures the land scape, where the clouds disperse and sun light bathes a quiet, tranquil field then all of a sudden gun fire crackles, mortars go off, U.S. soldiers charging an unseen enemy. You see G.I. Helmets immersed in the tall grass as they disappear among the green. A young baby bird dying, trying to crawl up a muddy embankment, a metaphor on how futile war is, when a crocodile is captured by soldiers, shows that even a top predator in the food chain is also vulnerable and cannot escape. This is where the conflict in man vs nature comes in.

A quick update: Found out Criterion is releasing this on Blu Ray, that is all I know, hopefully there will be more scenes, and an extended cut... this is great news!

The acting is top notch, from Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, Jim Caviezel, John Cusack, and some bit roles by John Travolta, George Clooney, Woody Harrelson, Jared Leto,  All of them I think didn't care about their screen time they just wanted to work with a great director who just took a 20 something year hiatus from film making, after directing Days of Heaven in '78 I believe and came back with this tour de force. I have even heard that Malick had a 6 hour movie that had to be trimmed down and actors Bill Pullman, Gary Oldman, Mickey Rourke had shot scenes but ultimately got cut and left on the editing floor.

I've seen this movie a half dozen times or so and I am still awed by it, the photography, the music, it's a beautiful film indeed with such deep themes of the human mind and spirit.

Please check out The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, I believe another movie that is poetic like, thought provoking, visually beautiful, with top notch acting.",1266019200,6,2730,4.581967213114754

1024127,1,6305438137,"I notice that many of the negative reviews talk about ""Hollywood liberals"", etc. so I want to make it clear that my negative review has nothing to do with politics. I'm somewhere between Noam Chomsky and Leon Trotsky, definitely no Neocon so I'm not at all averse to movies that show the negative side of US imperialism and wars such as Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, and War Inc. I also don't think that WWII was simply ""the good war"", there were many things the US did in that war that were morally questionable. But there is a difference between providing a balanced view free of flag waving and showing a distorted vision of history as this movie does.

During WWII the japanese lived by the Bushido warrior code. Many, perhaps most, of their soldiers would rather die than be taken prisoner. As a result they were vicious and ruthless to soldiers from the other side that surrendered rather than fight to the death. We see no evidence of that in this movie at all. The Japanese seem cowardly and foolish cowering and running from the Americans who often seem brutal for no reason. The monologues that various cast members have show no trace of historical context. They ponder the insanity of war and the evil of man with no recognition that the Japanese attacked the US less than a year before and that the Japanese had several years history of some of the most vicious brutality against civilians and captured enemies that the world has ever seen. My main problem with this isn't just that its morally questionable but that its completely historically inacurate.  The US soldiers felt that they were defending democracy and their country. We can question whether those views were really true now with hindsight (I think they were) but to pretend they didn't exist is just lazy film making.

To make matters worse this movie is just unbelievably long with long sections of brooding, grass waving, jungle life, flashbacks, etc. It does look beautiful but there is no character development or narrative flow. I fast forwarded through parts of the movie and it still seemed to take forever. I can only imagine what a hellish experience it would have been to be stuck in a theatre for almost three hours and watch this.

It all seems like a terrible waste because the few battle scenes that exist are fairly good, the cinematography is beautiful, and the cast is amazing but none of them have any interesting lines to say.

1024129,1,6305438137,"I can overlook the filmmaker's desire to make an antiwar movie and incorporate some vague Eastern, Buddhist message of nonviolence, but I cannot allow, without censure, the failure to provide proper historical context, the absence of which serves to demean and disparage American soldiers fighting under immense pressure and unbearable conditions against an implacable, cruel, and barbaric Japanese enemy. This film depicts American soldiers bayonetting Japanese soldiers who had surrendered and callously killing Japanese soldiers who posed no threat to them. Although there were certainly instances of this conduct, where is the proper context and history to explain WHY American soldiers reacted to this enemy in this manner?

On Guadalcanal, Marines were killed and mutilated by the enemy--ears cut off, genitals cut off, etc.  When corpsmen attempted to help wounded Japanese on the battlefield in the 1942, other nearby wounded Japanese soldiers, pretending to to be dead, shot these Americans trying to save the lives of their own fellow Japanese soldiers. The Japanese launched human wave banzai attacks, willing to sacrifice hundreds of their own men to kill but a few Americans. Review the Battle of the Tenaru for examples of Japanese fanaticism on Guadalcanal (sacrificing the lives of 800 Japanese to kill but 40 US Marines). The Japanese almost always refused to surrender, and employed ruses to make Americans believe they were surrendering, only to then ambush them when the American soldiers' guard was down. They granted absolutely no quarter to Americans captured--they killed all prisoners on Guadalcanal, usually in an horrific manner employing inhumane torture. Why should Americans have fought any differently than they way they did in response? And since over 90% of the Japanese never surrendered and fought to the death, how would you have reacted to this enemy?

I invite the reader to examine Winston Groom's ""1942"" and Iris Chang's ""The Rape of Nanking"" to understand the unparalleled brutal, bestial, and absolute evil military culture practiced by the Japanese during WWII. Captured American soldiers on the Bataan Death March, who suffered from dysentery, were given a choice if they stopped to relieve themselves: eat their own feces or be bayoneted or shot. More than a few complied and ate their feces, only to be shot anyway. Japanese soldiers practiced cannibalism on American prisoners, cutting them open while alive and removing their liver to be eaten with sake. They routinely beheaded POWs with their swords and routinely bayoneted soldiers in hospitals recovering from wounds and illness. If you can bear it, read about Japanese atrocities in Nanking, Singapore and Manila (contests to see who could cut off the most heads, gouging of infants' eyeballs, burying people alive, burning people alive, and torture beyond anything depicted in Dante's Inferno). And all I have related herein is only the proverbial tip of the iceberg.

So if a filmmaker wishes to depict American war crimes, first provide the context for those crimes and explain why American soldiers were at risk accepting the surrender of any Japanese soldier, few though they were. This film fails miserably in providing that context and for that reason alone is severely flawed.",1253750400,19,3287,5.33976833976834
1024209,2,6305438137,"To be charitable, this is a mixed bag.  Boasting some nice cinematography and fine acting, there was no reason this couldn't have been a better movie than it was.

Think about it. Early in the movie we are treated to multiple characters, Army officers and soldiers mulling over their imminent landing on the crucible of Guadalcanal.  We become aware that combat is intense.  And we learn that the Marines have already secured the beaches and are *advancing.*  This is a remarkable and heartening change after the devastating blows of Pearl Harbor, the fall of the Philippines, Guam and Wake Islands and a number of very costly sea battles.  The tide is beginning to turn!  Yet as we are introduced to senior officers, we learn that the first clear indication of a major character's motivation less than 12 months after seeing the US Fleet on the bottom of Pearl Harbor is not what you might expect.  It is not protecting our country.  It is not doing his duty.  It is not even vengeance against those who are rampaging across China, Indochina and the Philippines and the Western Pacific. It's professional advancement.

Men awaiting an uncontested landing from their Liberty Ship agonize over their fears -- and little else.  I believe if our troops in the REAL war had thought like these characters prior to battle, the War would have ended far differently.  But it didn't, did it?

Even the Japanese enemy is portrayed in ways that are clearly at variance with history.  There are two kinds of Japanese in this movie.  The first is a close relative to the Predator.  Invisible.  All-seeing.  Remorseless.  Omnipotent.  And yet, when the tide of the battle in the jungle suddenly turns for reasons unknown and US troops suddenly advance into an enemy camp (just trotting in) their erstwhile enemies are caught undressed and utterly unprepared, without an ounce of fight in them.  They seem absolutely eager to surrender.  In the World War II that my father fought in, Japanese soldiers were quite capable and very brave, often to the point of fanaticism.  Few were captured, many were killed because to surrender was a sign of dishonor.  Who but modern Hollywood would embark on an ""epic"" (not MY word) look at WWII in the South Pacific with an obvious (and willful?) lack of understanding of the code of Bushido?

One modestly realistic and compelling theme is the conflict a junior officer experiences in attempting to reconcile his desire to protect his men from useless sacrifice and his imperative to follow orders.  It is handled well.

Half a century later it's not out of line to revisit WWII with less of the patriotic fervor that often infused the movies of that era.  But when the New Left climbs into the Director's Chair, hang onto your hats.  You'll get a process that can drain even ""the Good War"" of meaning, of virtue and of historical accuracy.

Also, the few battle scenes that are in the film are not very realistic, I think.

1024211,2,6305438137,"I had an art teacher once who taught a revealing parable about art specifically, and life in general. It goes like this:

When explaining the crimson stroke of an accepted genius - he described the angst, the anger, the pain of the artist; the revel that's born of a brilliant spite. When a member of the audience asked how he knew all this - the teacher explained that a lifetime of study and understanding art gave him the ability truly see the work for what it was.

The person laughed and stood up. It was the artist. Before walking out he said he liked the color red.

This film is the product of a lifetime of 'study & understanding' by the sideliners/observers with a heavy dose of anti-American guilt. While the quality of the filmmaking is extraordinarily high, the storytelling is laughable. More a product of pacifist revision rather than a story of the men who fought that horrific battle of 1942-43.

Another example of a comic book, aka 'graphic novel', gone awry in the real world.

That the cast is made up of a Hollywood Who's Who among anti-war activists should've been my warning of what was to come. I'm genuinely surprised that Tim Robbins wasn't in the production.

Not to fault the left. A good anti-war film can be done and done extremely well. Even received by the right. Kirk Douglas/Stanley Kubrick's brilliant film 'Paths Of Glory' is a prime example of the insanity of combat. Respected by all as a testament to taking every approach and trying every avenue before committing the lives of the valiant to suffering and even death.

I wish Director Malick had taken the Apocalypse Now approach and given us a focus - one character whom we, the audience, could view the lens of doubt and failing faith. This film fails on its own merits and its sincere, but ridiculously holier-than-thou sermon.",1247356800,5,1821,4.689655172413793

1024213,5,6305438137,"Back in the late 90's, I prefered Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" over Malick's ""The Thin Red Line."" I think it was mostly because of the action sequences, and the characters (though stereotypical as they were). But now, as I rewatched ""The Thin Red Line,"" I find it even superior to ""Saving Private Ryan.""

TTRL isn't really a war film. It's actually a philosophical film that uses war as its topic. The American soldiers of WWII have landed on the island of Gauadalcanal, and it is their duty to overtake an airfield. As the men are on the island, they find themselves in the middle of unbelievable chaos. The things that these soldiers go through are things that are discovered in the dark side of human nature. Death, destruction, sacrifice, fear, and the crisis of faith are what these men go through.

Sean Penn and Jim Caviezel were extravagant in this film. Both of their characters have different views of life and death, but both come to fully understand mortality and death (though not how they expected it to be) near the end of the film. The numerous sub-plots may be a quite confusing to some, but I came to fully understand them after repeated viewings. Nick Nolte's story is especially astonishing and heartbreaking, as he (as Lieutenant Colonel Tall) cherishes his decorations and his strive for another promotion more than the men that he commands. Private Bell's (Ben Chaplin) motivation for survival is his memories of his wife back home. That's something almost every married soldier goes through. Captain Staros (Elias Koteas) fears for the lives of his own men, and as he argues with Tall over a flanking move, we see that he can never fully see sacrifice as a way to achieve a goal. These and many other sub-plots don't seem to have a conclusion, but they seem to be open for viewer interpretation.

As I have said before, this isn't really a war film. Sure, there are battle sequences, but that's only part of the point. Terrence Malick makes us think by showing us images of the beauty of nature, and the hellish nightmare that is war. The contrast between Mother Nature and Human Nature is what drives this film, and it's captured rather perfectly. The stunning cinematography by John Toll, the ethereal music score by Hans Zimmer, and the nearly flawless editing by Leslie Jones, Saar Klein, and Billy Weber make this film a definite classic. Too bad that SPR (although another great film) took away some of its box office and oscar potential. If this film was made and released a few years before or after the released of SPR, then TTRL would have been bigger than it is now.

According to The Internet Movie Database, this film was originally six hours long! But Malick cut it down to about two and 3/4 hours. Now I'm hoping to see a brand new DVD edition which features the original six-hour cut. And not only that, but a load of special features (like audio commentaries and behind-the-scene featurettes) as well. We can only hope for now though . . .

1024214,4,6305438137,"I've read James Jones' source novel, and, being a devout admirer of Mr. Jones' work, I can say that Mr. Malick's version utterly failed in capturing Jones' hardcore realism. James Jones was most certainly NOT zen-like or poetic in his narrative. Make no mistake, ""The Thin Red Line"" is a love story. It's the love men have for their comrades in arms in the most appalling of circumstances. Readers need to remember that the main character of the novel is ""C for Charlie"" company.

As for the film, it's amazingly inconsistent. The camera work is terrific. And Malick can handle an action sequence with relative ease. But making Witt a deserter was flat out wrong, I felt. Witt was a reluctant transferee from ""C for Charlie"" to Cannon Company. Malick's making him a deserter was against the character's basic ethic. He was a thirty year man and was passionately devoted to his old outfit. Indeed he was so devoted, he deserted his new outfit in order to march with his old buddies.

The performances are good (especially Nick Nolte as the overly ambitious Col. Tall). However, seeing the company land and make their way to the enemy positions simply didn't happen in the book. What Jones did was pass ""C for Charlie"" up the line like something on a production line before the slaughter.

I certainly can't deny that much went into this production. I just wish the script had reflected more of the source novel. It might be visual poetry, but when someone's trying to kill you in any way possible, zen-like thoughts and ideas of poetry go right out the window.

So in the end, Malick follows Jones' vision closely in some aspects and then goes off into weird tangents in others. I thought ""Saving Private Ryan"" was superior in terms of focus. ""The Thin Red Line,"" however, is also more unsettling. You left the theater after seeing ""Ryan"" in tears, feeling somewhat exhausted, but ultimately triumphant. I left the theater after seeing ""The Thin Red Line,"" not sure of just what I saw. It stuck in my craw that way. And that's not necessarily a bad thing. Perhaps that's what Malick had in mind. Sometimes experiences in war aren't so black and white. High ambiguity over the experience is what he was aiming for; pride in having served with good men, but rage at having seen them sacrifice their lives in what could be observed as folly.

If ambiguity is what Malick was aiming for, then he accomplished his mission.",1244764800,4,2416,4.702127659574468

Up until lately, I agreed with most other people that Steven Spielberg's film was more more appealing than this Terrence Malick movie....but now I am not so sure. I find both of them fascinating.

Well, the narration, as I have since discovered - especially by putting the English subtitles on - is not what I first though. It is simply the anguish several of the soldiers feel as - in the middle of a horrific war - they try to make sense of life, death, suffering, war and spiritual matters in general. They agonize over loneliness of being separated from their wives and family, or they compare two extremes in civilizations as they now exist in one that is far removed in one they came from. Spiritual matters are discussed by Believers and non- believers, optimists and cynics.

 It's pretty heady stuff, as it turns out, and pretty such sums up this film which, of course is rich in visuals.  The scenery, much of it filmed in either Australia or the Solomon Islands, is just gorgeous, just the kind Malick loves. A true lover of nature, Malick gives us one spectacular scene after another with all the greens of grasses, tress and leaves you'd ever want to see, complemented by an assortment of exotic birds and reptiles. It's just stunning in parts. Man, I'd like to see this on a pristine Blu-Ray transfer!

Character development is not a strong point, as Malick needed more time than a feature film could offer.  At the same time, it could have been cut to 90 minutes as an action film and would have likely been a hit, but that wasn't Malick's goal.

Watch this film as you would a mini-series....in 3 separate sittings, about an hour apiece.  A Thin Red Line is too intense and too complicated to be swallowed all at once.  After two hours any art can be tiresome, and the inner contemplative monologues (from the novel) featured here could weary the most patient viewer.  Upon later viewings, the poetry comes to life and one sees how it relates to what is happening.

What makes this film great is the cinematography, the landscape, the music, the lyrics from the book, and some splendid acting.  The infantry attack sequences are breathtaking and the camera work and musical sequences complement them perfectly.  The film's emotional and artistic climax comes with the storming of a Japanese camp at the top of a hill after days of horrific fighting.  This 15 minute segment ought to be shown in film schools around the world.

Does ""A Thin Red Line"" stand up to other great war films?  No, it's not in the company of ""Apocalypse Now"" or ""Full Metal Jacket"".  But it compares well to Band of Brothers or Saving Private Ryan (both of which  are also excellent).  It's definitely worth watching if you like war movies or enjoy great cinema.",1232064000,2,1836,4.666666666666667
1024281,1,6305438137,"The thing that made ""The Thin Red Line"" a flawed war movie for me was the way some of the characters were cast and/or filmed in a way that made them undistinguishable from each other.  They were supposed to be guys you could follow, but looked so similar they became a few more faces in the crowd with extra camera time.

Next, the thing they did that STUNK it up for me is...

* * * * SPOILER to follow * * * *

...the way they showed the American soldiers brutalizing the Japanese, namely the most vulnerable ones.  Pulling teeth from the wounded and killing the nonthreatening guys (the Japanese soldiers surrendering or in the act of praying on their knees).

We got to see the praying guys get shot and bayonetted more than once in this film, sometimes in slow motion from the first person point of view.  In TTRL's later segments, the way our guys were cutting the enemy down when there was no fight in them was hardly cathartic in the way that, say, ""We Were Soldiers"" went when we took the attack to the enemy.  But in this film, the enemy became so passive in the wake of our regular sadistic brutality that toward the end you almost wanted to see our guys get popped.  I don't mind a ""War is hell"" theme, but not mixed with a ""boo for our side.""",1230681600,6,1255,4.261603375527426
1024282,4,6305438137,"This film in my opinion is an epic combination of sight, sound, and performance.  Nick Nolte's role was Oscar worthy.  It is the most powerful, gutteral, desperate, portrayal of a combat commander ever filmed.  There is no fluff, no contrived dialogue, only a soldier pushing for the victory that has eluded him his entire life, his generation's life.  Koteas as Cpt. Starles is excellent, as are Caviezel, Cusack, Chaplin, and Penn.  The philosophical meanderings and voice over take quite a bit of flack. I think one needs to be reminded that these are not fully formed men we're observing.  These are 18 year old boys standing on the brink of savagery, murder, and anihilation.  When they have time to ponder their situation, how would you expect them to think, how deep and meaningful is the philosophy of an 18 year old?  These boys that have been thrown into the meat grinder are dealing with the horror that is confronting them, and posessing them, the best that they can.  They get drunk, foul themselves, cry, run away, attack, and sometimes converse with the only others who can possibly relate.  The cogs in this war machine are individuals, each carrying their own baggage, wounds, sucesses, and failures.  Expose them to combat and these things either melt away and reform, or they galvanize and remain in state.  That is what the film is about to me.",1229558400,2,1364,4.8068669527897
1024283,3,6305438137,"Malik's epic anti-war treatise is less effective on repeat and its pitch at the sublime is best savoured on big-screen theatre darkness to work its magic. Much of the necessary swatches of sky through tree canopy, macro nature, and shifting light over sussurating grasses, the epiphanies experienced from the Christ-like Caviezel used to counter the violence of combat terror, is lost on small format. Initially, the film moved me. Now, and with the pretentious,'New World', added to Malik's oeuvre, I side with those who experience tedium, while holding that it is an incomparably better film. The lack of character development is essential to the director's overview; their parts clearly serve the director's philosophy. Yet there are stunning cameo roles from Nolte, Penn, and Cavizel. It is one of the few war films that delve into the individual fear and deaths of the combatants. But there's too much repetition, even given that...flashbacks to the young bride, Penn's pessimistic utterances, the musings of the Jim Caviezel character which verge on a parody of Tarkovskian metaphysical doubt. He alone seems bent on a spiritual quest to redeem the self midst the atrocities, and a theosophic strain leaks through his pronouncements. His self-sacrifice is inevitable. A half-hour edit would profit the audience, and I would nominate this final section. But who could seriously quibble with an American director pitching at the transcendental, a glimpse of a better and redemptive world than the one thrust upon the terrorised youth depicted. Malick, bravely, went for the big picture in this one and must have felt to the far side of his culture in the act of doing so.",1226707200,3,1675,5.161764705882353
1024284,1,6305438137,"I saw this movie in theaters when it first came out.  I was a child, then, 10 or 11 years old.  Maybe I should have been set up to be bored, but even looking back on it now, ten years later, I find myself justified in claiming it boring.

Even as a child, I wasn't the sort easily bored by adult-type movies.  I could sit through a movie like ""Courage Under Fire"" and be entertained.  This one, however, had about two scenes of action, and the rest just people lounging around talking to themselves.

First they try a D-Day style mock-up beach landing, only there's no one firing at them from the beach, so that ends up looking awkward, whether or not it happened in real life.  Then comes a charge up a hill, where there is ACTION~!  Then the soldiers make it into a village, where the spend the remaining 1.5-2 hours living among the people, talking to themselves, thinking about stuff, and doing pretty much absolutely nothing, either physically or mentally, with no content left to excite World War II studiers either in the form of action, strategy, or insight.

What you get instead is these characters, most of which are given no time or chance to develop into more than caricatures of generic emotions or archetypes, rambling about their lives with random images and hammy philosophy.

At the end, the Japanese attack the village and all the soldiers run or die.  And I'm left wondering exactly why the film even existed.

And then I remember this is the same director who made ""The New World"", another movie with half a page of plot, and thirty pages of people frolicking about to cinematography and pretentious attempts at being an ""art film"", so that anyone who comes out of the film not liking it can simply be scoffed at with the typical ""You just don't get it.  Typical stupid American needing your car chases and shoot-outs to be entertained"" manifesto.

Well I'm not a stupid American who needs car chases and shoot-outs to be entertained.  I shed real tears of emotion at Daniel Day-Lewis's portrayal of Daniel Plainview in ""There Will Be Blood"".  I gape in amazement at the drama of such movies as ""Twelve Angry Men"" and ""Midnight Cowboy"", laugh at movies ranging from ""The Big Lebowski"" and ""Annie Hall"" to ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film For Theaters"", and even get thrills from action movies like ""Casino Royale"" or ""Munich"".

1024285,1,6305438137,"I am shocked by the number of glowing reviews this movie received - I saw it on opening day in a theater crowded with active duty military troops (I am a retired vet), and most got up and walked out by the half-way point! And I wish I had walked out too! Having 14 months+ in Iraq, I do not see that our troops would feel much differently about this movie today than they did back in 1999. My feelings are not based on the fact that the movie is ""anti-war"" - the more accurately a war movie portrays combat, the less likely it is you want to go out and advocate violence. The problem is that The Thin Red Line is very poorly executed depiction of infantry combat and does not provide either compelling characters or credible story that makes you care.

The Thin Red Line is set during one of the most pivotal battles in the Pacific, but there is non of the sense of desperation in the movie. Plot development? What plot? Character development? None of that either. Dialog? Acting? Wooden and melodramatic. The cinematography is gorgeous, but does not save the movie. How many flashbacks to a the same coconut on a beach can a man tolerate? All in all, I was absolutely bored.

If you are interested in a good war movie set in the WWII Pacific Theater of Operations I suggest The Great Raid  based on actual events and adapted from William B. Breuer's book about the 1945 liberation of the Cabanatuan Prison Camp on the Philippine island of Luzon. But I suspect that many of those who have given The Thin Red Line a thumbs up would balk at the The Great Raid which in addition to being anti-war, also demonstrates why you sometimes have to fight with its opening a scene of the Japanese massacre of prisoners of war on Palawan.",1224201600,9,1726,4.4043887147335425

However, the movie itself has a relentless boredom, much more like a Benneton commercial than a feature film. Malick, despite his Days of Heaven classic, lost touch with audiences and maybe even filmmaking over his 20 year absence. The art of conveying ideas and powerful visual metaphors within a story worked with David Lean. With Malick's work here, it's a whimsical, uncertain philosophical reference without meaning.

Several actors like Jim Cavizel were good to watch but overall the movie meandered so much that, when it ended, I thought that they had left off a reel of film.",1223337600,7,691,5.06140350877193

I still can't grasp why some people give Penn so much credit for this and other performances.  His acting skills are simplistic and unbelievable, unless the part includes a drunk or drug addict.

First so you know where I'm coming from.  I vote Republican, I like war movies and I can't stand celebrities preaching anti war propaganda.

It's true, ""The Thin Red Line"" is very different from ""Saving Private Ryan"".  With SPR, you have a small group of guys that you follow from point A to point B.  Real simple.  Plus a lot of the film is focused on war images.  I think that it could even be argued that some scenes in SPR do not represent our veterans very well, such as Matt Damon's character breaking down and crying during the middle of a battle scene.  And it seemed like none of the characters got along in that movie.

I have a grand parent that fought in the same place ""The Thin Red Line"" is focused on.  What's different about TTRL is that instead of being solely focused on battle scenes, it humanizes the troops.  By that I mean, it puts you right there in the field with them, and makes you realize these aren't faceless soldiers, they're somebody's wife, husband, or dad. SPR did that a bit with Tom Hank's character but that's about it.  TTRL let's you really ""experience"" what it was probably like to land on a foreign island that's rich in beauty but you know you're about to go into battle shortly.

Some people mentioned that this movie is convoluted and that it doesn't focus entirely on one person.  That's true, this movie is the thinking person's Saving Private Ryan.  If you want to vege out and see combat while the soldiers remain automons then maybe TTRL isn't for you.  But if you can watch a movie like the GodFather and follow along and you want more than CGI and special effects then you'll probably love TTRL.

I gave this movie only 4 stars because after  the main battle is over, it does amble on a bit but then picks right back up again.",1217289600,2,1807,4.375375375375375

This movie was a waste of my time, a waste of my money, and a waste of resources. I should have known what the result of movie would be, considering the cast.

The cinematography is breathtaking, the directing inspired, the acting first-rate. The ensemble cast pulls off a miracle - simultaneously portraying the horrors of war and the subtlety and quiet mystery of the human mind.

The script blends action and philosophy (!) in a way few films would even attempt, and does so with an ease that staggers the mind. This movie deserved every one of its seven Academy Award nominations.

So truth be told this movie is brilliant.  Its message is of humanity with all its glory and beauty shining through.  Its about goodness, friendship and love weighed againts the twisting vines of war, desperation and lonliness. Its about finding a spark within the individual, to acknowledge evils, acknowledge death, but to rise above it.  The setting of Guadecanal is no more 'the story' for the Thin Red Line than Vietnam is the setting for Apocolpyse Now.  Its just the netting that holds the true meaning of the movie in check.

1024361,5,6305438137,"Another film on the US-Japan war in the Pacific, will you say. Of course, you'd be right but of course you are wrong. It is a film about any war waged by the US in any foreign country. That's the first point and it reveals so clearly the absurdity of the tactical thinking of some officers who see the war they are taking part in as a springboard for their egotistic self-satisfied career, and their men are nothing but pawns that have to be moved, by force most of the time, and not the force of rational arguments. Hence, if you have a bunker at the top of a hill, you do not go around to attack it from the flank or even from behind. You just run up the bare slope of that hill under the fire of their machine guns, and you take it. The men must do that. The commanding officer will of course go last, and most probably will come last to certify the work of the men. The second element is that this film shows how the minds of the soldiers still go on and they mix news from home and the famous letters from their wives who are asking for a divorce, and secretly hoping that will not be necessary. And the film reveals how deep the breach, the cut, the rip, or even the abyss is between life on the front and life back home, between the present and what is and can only be the past. Life back home has no future as long as the war goes on. The film is an absolutely fascinating denunciation of the psychological but also spiritual destruction a war is for any soldier who is de-structured and will have to rebuild his own personal psyche, structure, social being, human being, life in one word, afterwards. Third, the film shows the ugliness of war, the dirt, the blood, the din or even the blaring roaring noise, the mud, the physical suffering and death in the name of the fatherland or the motherland, the physical torture that is imposed onto you, that you impose onto yourself, or that you impose onto the others. The best example is how a captain who resisted the silly order of the colonel and whose resistance is shown as perfectly sane since it brings victory and the economy of a few deaths, is nevertheless sent back to the US, with a medal, but in the most disgraceful way: to get him out of the tramping feet of the colonel who is a pure fascist. All in all this film applies to the second world war the discourse we are used to hearing about the Vietnam war and it convincingly shows that all wars are bad, inhuman, inhumane, purely non-human, cruel, absurd, and probably aimless. It could and anyway should have been avoided. A war is for each soldier a loss of virginity, purity, happiness, promised rewards. ""They want you to die or to lie with them."" And that's all. That bunch of killing, deadly, fatal, lethal lies lead the soldier to looking for another dimension in the world, some god, transcending force that can wrap you up in its arms in a totally sexless and purely spiritual comforting gesture that makes you go on, on the war path of the limited political ambitions of those who govern us. In a war there is no power of the people, for the people and by the people but only power of the politicians for themselves and by themselves. A war, any war is a total loss of freedom.

1024363,1,6305438137,"If you want to see a movie about what American soldiers experienced during the Battle of Guadalcanal, ""Thin Red Line"" isn't it. There are two really good movies about Guadalcanal and the men who fought there, ""Guadalcanal Diary"" and ""Pride of the Marines"".

Thin Red Line's story is incoherent, and the actions of the men in battle are completely unrealistic. The opening scene with two soldiers somehow abandoning their unit and hiding on a friendly tropical island is ludicrous. The Japanese Army occupied all the islands in that part of the Pacific. Guadalcanal was the very first island we tried to take away from them. Troopships went directly from Hawaii to Guadalcanal. There was no other safe haven until they reached distant Australia. Neither would a troopship stop so that two missing men could be retrieved. Japanese submarines were just as deadly as German U-boats. Troopships never stopped for anything in WW2. And the movie just goes downhill from this point.

The first battle shows the American unit assaulting a dug-in Japanese position. During the American assault one of the men has dreams about being back home in bed with his wife or sweetheart. Have you ever talked to a combat veteran? When real soldiers are in combat, they don't daydream about anything! They hope that they don't mess themselves because they are so scared. They are trying to find a way to stay alive in that incredibly dangerous situation, but at the same time they try to watch out for their buddies. Believe me, they don't daydream about intimate moments with sweethearts when bullets are flying and buddies are being killed or wounded.

This movie presents a fantasy about what a director, who never went to war, thinks it might have been like. He was dead wrong. I think this movie actually is a disservice to the men and women who fought in WW2 (my father was one of those men - he fought in the jungles of the Pacific against the Japanese.) Don't waste your money on this stinker - unless you are satisfied with watching beautiful scenery. I rate the movie as one of the worst war movies I've ever seen. I wouldn't own it if somebody offered it to me for free.",1206403200,9,2160,4.73936170212766
1024364,1,6305438137,"I rented this film with the hopes of experiencing an excellent piece of cinematography and gritty war realism. What I received was something so unrelated to this dream that it is sickening. The majority of the film is devoted to inane philosophical babbling by simple-minded southern soldiers with bad accents. Every scene is packed full of forced lines and random thoughts that have seemingly no relation to war of any type.

Now, if these scenes were spaced out between the action, and had occurred after some horrendous battle, I could perhaps forgive the film. Unfortunately, they drag on for the majority of the movie. Even so, a few decent battle scenes would have made this experience passable. It is not to be. Foolish looking kids run around bunched up like cheap extras with no idea whats supposed to be going on. Generic dirt clod explosions with a few flames are the high end of special effects one can expect.

For most of the first half of the film we never see the faces of the enemy. This occurs as we are spoonfed scene after scene of ridiculous poetry by ""simple soldiers."" I give this movie an F for being unable to impart even the simplest notion of what it is to be a soldier. Dramatic deaths are often comical and unbelievably verbose. Specifically, a rather loud mouthed and seemingly mentally disabled soldier accidently pulls the pin out of a grenade in his belt. He stands and looks at the pin, runs into the side of a hill - and then the grenade go off on his belt. Does he explode? No, there is a small pop, and it looks like he has somehow miraculously escaped harm. The slow and overdone death scene that follows quickly disabuses us of this notion.

On the note of historical realism, Guadalcanal was a hardfought and bitter series of battles between the Japanese and Americans with the Japanese reinforcing and shelling American positions during the night. During the day, it was almost constant bombardment by American artillery, aircraft, and naval elements. Unfortunately, this film only succeeds in convincing me that Guadalcanal is (and remains) a tropical paradise for the entirety of the war. There is not a single scene where we experience any ambient fighting sounds. No aircraft flyovers, no machine gun chatter, no distant explosions. It seems apparent that Charlie Company and the Japanese were the only people who actually did any fighting on the island.

Overall, this film is an incoherent an overly philosophical mess of a movie with poor action, nonsensible characters, and no redeeming qualities. I advise people to stay away from this movie and not waste three hours of their life on such a film.",1206057600,5,2647,4.810989010989011

I think most of the criticisms given here are justified. There is not much character development; the pacing is slow; the story doesn't seem to go anywhere.

So why four stars? Well, I don't think ""The Thin Red Line"" is really about war. It's a meditation on the nature of reality. Is the universe good, evil, or random? Like ""Moby Dick"", many different philosophies are presented in the midst of a wandering plot. The watcher is forced to search for some rhyme or reason, but at the same time you can argue that there isn't much there. Your answer might correspond to your own ideas about the meaning of life. Our own lives have defined beginnings and ends, but most don't follow neat plot lines. Many people spend their entire lives searching for their own meaning and purpose.

I'm not crazy about how these philosophies are conveyed. Rule #1 of movie making is ""show, don't tell."" The characters here only exist to voice their particular worldview, either in long voiceovers or abstract arguments with other soldiers. However, despite the questionable technique, many of these voices are profoundly moving.

***MINOR SPOILER***
I was espcially struck by scenes involving dying baby bird. The camera closes on the bird in close range after a scene of terrible mayhem. Later in the movie, the main character muses that ""one man can look at a dying bird and see nothing but unanswered pain... another man looks and sees glory... something smiles back at him."" This is the key to the movie and the driver behind the shots of nature in all its beauty and brutality.
***

I didn't really see this movie as an indictment of war. In the words of Robert E Lee, """"It is well that war is so terrible, lest we grow too fond of it."" Even a war fought for the best intentions is horrific when it comes to the battle field and individual suffering. In keeping with that, I didn't think Nick Nolte's character was meant to lampoon the evil petty officer, though he's certainly unsympathetic. At the end of the day, I think the movie uses him the same way it uses everyone else, as a mouthpiece for a particular point of view.

Bottom line: requires a lot of patience, but ultimately quite provoking. The cinematography and Pacific Islander singer are quite lovely. Worth watching.",1203120000,6,2403,4.739234449760765
1024427,5,6305438137,"Terrence Malick decided to come back from self imposed exile after 20 years (!) and made this film.  While it does ramble a bit at times, it is one of the most unique, poetic, transcendtal war films ever made.  There are such etheral, extraordinary moments here.  I saw this in a theater, and despite the fact that some audience members making really stupid remarks during the film (someone said ""shoot that son of a bitch"" real loud during the film...a**hole), it didn't detract from the fact that this is one of the most artistic films ever made about war.  Many people compared this film to Saving Private Ryan, which was released the same year.  Private Ryan was a Hollywood film, this film is an art film.  It may sound a little pretentious, but The Thin Red Line captured the reality of war a lot more accurately than Spielberg's film did.  This was the better of the 2 films, and while many dislike this film intensely, I don't understand why.

I find it remarkable that despite a 20 year layoff, Malick came back and made such a memorable film.  I read somewhere that the original version of this was rougly 6 hours.  I don't know, but if that is true, I would very much like to see that, because I believe it would be an ultimate masterpiece.  But this 3 hour version is the only one that's been released to date, so hopefully a longer director's cut (if it does exist) will emerge.",1202601600,2,1391,4.48015873015873
1024428,5,6305438137,"I feel that this movie is magnificent and certainly worthwhile for someone to go see. I am struck by the fact that there exists such a polarization in audiences with their varied reactions to this film. Perhaps art and interpreting aesthetics is a lot more subjective than some of us believe. There is no universal or objective conclusion we all collectively reach, merely divisive reactions we all harbor (which are especially true for ""The Thin Red Line"").

Terrence Malick graduated from Harvard with a degree in Philosophy, so naturally his screenplays and direction in general are unique and not commonplace to mainstream cinema. Personally, I do not hold any type of aversion for Philosophy or Poetry to be melded into a film. I find that abstract approaches can be just as meaningful as a more conventional approach would yield. The first time I saw this movie, I had somewhat of an ambivalent reaction. I realized I had witnessed some of the most powerful and sublime scenes created, yet, my mind wanted a big finale that most war films have, and I wanted a better structure for the disjointed story to embody. I know that I have been conditioned by all the films I have seen before, and wanted this one to follow roads predetermined by my own discrimination... I almost wrote the film off as ""artsy"" or even ""pretentious"", but so much of it resonated with me long after I watched it. I began thinking more about some of those beautiful scenes, and I found that my mind had been stimulated.

I don't believe all people can appreciate ""The Thin Red Line"" the first time they watch it. They almost have to be prepared for it, in the sense that this is not a run-of-the-mill war or action film. This is much deeper and cogitative than standard fare. I would surmise that most audiences generally want to turn off their minds and prop their feet up when they watch movies. Most don't seem to be interested in looking deeper, or considering abstract notions that transcend stock entertainment.

Maybe ""The Thin Red Line"" was not marketed accurately, and many viewers were caught off guard at what unfolded.

I think this movie is outstanding and worthy of film goers who are going to give it some deserved thought and consideration. I feel weary of patrons who deem this film as 'pseudo-intellectual' or 'dreck'. I think that an open mind is essential in understanding ""The Thin Red Line"" and other art forms that reach for virtuosity.",1201305600,2,2438,4.756501182033097

Lingers in your mind long after the viewing. Terrific direction and screenplay.

My only ""beef/complaint"" has to be the voiceovers, the constant nature shots and the never-ending flashbacks of one soldier's wife. Please, Mr. Malick, lighten up on that stuff, would you? There is no need to beat the audiance over the head with it.
The various voice-overs could have been eliminated entirely, and the nature shots and flashbacks could easily have been cut by half. The movie, as it stands, is too long.

Other than that, I say: get it. It will punch you in the belly,  and then knock you on your rear end. War, the real thing, is not a John Wayne movie. This motion picture gives you the agonizing truth.

You can't really compare the book to the movie as they seem to tell different stories based on the same events.  Both send powerfull messages.

This movie should not be taken in any way as a true, realistic portrayal of what infantry fighting was like on the Pacific Islands in WWII, rather, someone's interpreting WWII according to their ultra liberal, political agenda.  We see infantry combat assaults without artillery or air support, tho both are clearly available; no tank support, US Army officers lying down with and crying on the shoulders of Japanese POW's, and vice versa; an infantry company commander arguing with and refusing the direct orders of his superior commander in the middle of an assault without being instantly relieved; and many other totally absurd scenes that violate standard infantry tactics and military policy.  Obviously, this anti-war movie was written, directed and produced by people totally unfamiliar with infantry combat, and tried to make it agree with their own preconceived (amateurish) notions and  current-day anti-war agendas.  While the cinematrophy was excellent, the scenes jumped around to the point of being very hard to understand what was happening.  An amateurish, unrealistic rendition is the best I can say for this (anti-)war movie. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, rather, watch ""Saving Private Ryan"" for a more realistic portrayal of infantry war.

1024507,1,6305438137,"What a pity ""The Thin Red Line"" is. What a pity that it was released the same year of Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan."" What a pity that it was nominated for Best Picture against Spielberg's aforementioned ""Saving Private Ryan."" What a pity this movie has always been in the shadows of ""Saving Private Ryan."" What a pity that I should see it the day after I see ""Saving Private Ryan."" Like ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""The Thin Red Line"" takes place during World War II. The battle that ""The Thin Red Line"" covers though is the Battle of Guadalcanal. Beautiful, beautiful Guadalcanal. A place so beautiful, that I suspect most of talent involved in this film were involved for the sole purpose of visiting that beautiful land.

Even the movie itself seems to be more interested in the land then the story, as the story is a mess. A captivating mess, but a mess nonetheless. One that is very untidy and very irritating to be around for too long. Unfortunately, the movie clocks in ten minutes shy of three hours, and effectively overstays its welcome. The movie poster/box highlights many big stars, such as Oscar winner Sean Penn, Oscar winner Adrien Brody, Oscar Winner George Clooney, Oscar nominee John Travolta, Oscar nominee John C. Reilly, Oscar nominee Woody Harrelson...there is some MAJOR talent behind this movie! I can't stress this enough. Yet most of these actors make glorified cameos, while Nick Nolte and Jim Caviezel (who are the closest things we have to protagonists in this movie) get billing UNDER the title!

Heck, Adrien Brody is billed as the second major star on the poster above the title, yet is in the movie for about...3 minutes or so. Trust me, I counted. You probably are now reading more information on actor billing then you probably care to, but I stress this because story, character development, and star power is very absent in this film. There are scenes where Jim Caviezel remembers his wife at home through flashbacks. There are moments when Nick Nolte argues with his soldiers (most of whom are nameless and unknown). Sometimes a random narrator narrates the movie (most of the time it sounded like John Travolta, though he was only on screen for 2 minutes and 21 seconds). Most of the time though it's beautiful scenery, characters starring at each other for long periods of time, and once in awhile things will start blowing up.

As a movie, I'm not sure what the purpose was when they decided to make it. There is much skill behind the craft to be sure. The cinematography, special effects, and camera work is all very impressive. This is a great looking and sounding film. But it just sits there. Not much happens most of the time and we never really get a sense that anything is happening. No main characters to follow, no major mission is being fulfilled, nothing that really matters. I just don't get it. There's a great movie somewhere in this mess, I just can't seem to find it. What a pity, for I'd sure like to see that great movie someday.

If you've read the book, you might agree. If you've read Jone's entire trilogy, you'll notice much of the script is lifted from FROM HERE TO ETERNITY. Not all of the books themes, however, are represented in the film and MANY characters are combined or missing alltogether.

One of the many redeeming aspects of this film is how the movie does not force feed you. It doesn't barrage you with speeches, action, dramatic music, more action, action with dramatic music, and yet more hyperbolic action/music--doing all the thinking for you. If you have a short attention span, or are uncomfortable interpreting for yourself what you are watching, this movie is not for you. Go watch Saving Private Ryan, Patton, Guns of Navarone, anything but this. But if you want lucid cinematography, deep internal monologue, and spoken lines beyond ""Let's get them Japs,"" and time to digest what you are watching, then get this movie.

It is the only war movie I would say is beautiful. There's no didactive hawk/dove preaching, chest thumping or flag waving, rather a complex portrayal of regular people, just like us, thrust into a hellish situation, and what goes on in their minds as they endure the everyday brutality of warfare.

Like a good poem that may only contain a couple dozen words, many lines and ideas in this movie demand you sit and think, to concentrate very very hard--to try to get to the marrow of the deeper meaning--something that takes lots of introspection and time.

For the people who were looking at their watches, or complaining it was too long, here's a hint: during the long sequences of silence or ""inaction,"" there's a reason for it: something pithy has just ben served to you, or is about to be. If you still don't get it, go ahead and one-star this movie, and go get any of those other sugar-coated cookie cutter war movies that don't want you to do much thinking.

This movie had such potential.  But it goes absolutely nowhere.  A pitiful attempt at being profound, resulting only in bombast.  The ""finished work"" is simply a swollen collage of beautifully filmed vignettes (complete with irrelevant and saccharine flashbacks) stitched together in a clumsy attempt to trick the viewer into believing that there is a point.  There is none!

1024515,5,6305438137,"I watched this movie late in the evening, after coming home from my son's 14th birthday party. My festive mood quickly turned responsive and contemplative. My son watched part of it too but fell asleep due to exhaustion. Thin Red Line is a fascinating view on a dark and cruel chapter of WWII, the bitter, relentless fight over Guadalcanal in the Pacific theater of war. What struck me most about this film is the fact that man's conflict is set against the overwhelming background of nature and the elements. Although the fighting is intense and without mercy, nature is in large part undisturbed by it and uninterested in the outcome. The fighting scenes are intersparsed by scenes of tranquility and peacefulness. American GI's and Japanses Imperial troops are both depicted as accidental heroes and victims. There are exiting vistas and images of nature, animals, sunsets and sundowns, clouds and the omnipresent jungle. You hear the rustling of the wind in the grass and the trees. Like it must have been for the soldiers most of the time. Although there are parallels with Saving Private Ryan, it is an altogether different approach. The acting is great. Especially Jim Caviezel's and Sean Penn's. The actors doing a cameo (John Travolta, Nick Nolte)in my view are far less convincing.

I recommend this movie to anyone who is bored by the average run of the mill war flick with brainless heroes who rampage through the movie shooting everything that moves without being hit or hampered by remorse. Mr Terence Malick did an excellent job. I look forward to his next movie, whatever that may be.

The juxtaposition of beauty and agony is gripping. An all-star cast seems a bit overdone in places, with big-name celebrities making only brief appearances at some rather odd intervals. The philosophical thoughts by some of the characters was an intriguing ingredient, but again, echoed Jones' writing. For war film junkies or WWII buffs, this is a must-see.

1024597,5,6305438137,"This is not a ""war film"" and it is not an ""antiwar film."" What Malick (a former philosophy student) has done is *use* the setting of modern warfare as a way of communicating the essence of Schopenhauer's metaphysics and ethics. Underneath the surface of the observable, individuated phenomena, the essence of the world is will: a  non-individuated, passionate yet pointless destructive striving. The will is embodied in Nick Nolte, who lives to fight and win, while recognizing that his way is the way of ""nature."" ""Look at those vines, Staros, swallowing everything. Nature is cruel."" True insight into the nature of the will, however, leads to compassion for the suffering of others, since we are all One behind appearances, and renunciation of desiring (and its inevitable concomitants, conflict and suffering). The denial of the will is represented by Jim Cavaziel. According to Schopenhauer, if one recognizes the futility of willing but cannot achieve this state of complete ascetic denial, the only other alternative is to mitigate one's own suffering by keeping one's expectations as low as possible. This stance is embodied by Sean Penn. From the first, crucial dialogue between Penn and Cavaziel, the agenda of the film is placed before us: given that the world is as it is, should we cling to this world and despair, or should we turn away from it and transcend? As Penn says, ""there's no world but this one."" Cavaziel replies, ""I've seen another world."" *That* is what the film is about: a choice between mysticism and nihilism.

The film is not pro-war, because it assumes as Schopenhauer did, that moral justifications of war are always nothing more than rationalizations of a more fundamental need for violence. The film is not anti-war, because unlike all other anti-war films, it does not set up a contrast between a morally praiseworthy form of ordinary life and a morally repugnant form of activity created by and creating war. If war is an expression of the cruelty of nature, or reality itself, moral judgment of it makes no sense---one might as well condemn the jungle for being jungle. This goes some way toward explaining the peculiar detachment the film aspires to and achieves. The catastrophe the characters are caught up in is the world itself, and the film offers no adequate response to it than to serenely transcend it.",1175472000,21,2350,4.99234693877551

1024603,5,6305438137,"The Thin Red Line elevates James Jones' 1960's novel in that rare way some motion pictures do when they exceed the quality of the original material.

This is a slow-moving film that places many demands on the time and awareness of a viewer---it glides along a bit too long at the last and seems unable to decide on when to end---but with its cerebral story wedded to supremely violent imagery, The Thin Red Line blew me away (no pun intended) when I first saw it at the theater with my grandfather in the late 1990's. It's true the small screen is not the ideal venue upon which to see this visually-oriented masterpiece, but even within the confines of a home theater system, the brilliance of Malick's work should be apparent, and this DVD makes the best of unavoidable limitations.

Telling the sometimes brutal and often intensely introspective story of the men of a US Army company in the thick of the fight in the Guadalcanal campaign, The Thin Red Line is mostly told within the interior monologues of its primary participants. Though several big-name stars have roles here (often extremely short roles) there is little glamour, and with the way Malick has spread out the opportunities for nearly each man of the cast to have at least one featured moment, there really is no single transcendent performance in the movie. The narrative technique allows the story itself to be the real star of The Thin Red Line rather than those who act within it, and this rare achievement is integral to what raises this film above so many others both within the war genre and outside it. As with all Terrence Malick productions that I've seen, the pace of the unfolding plot allows time for the setting to manifest with at least equal importance to the story or the human actors. Here we view such startling sights as the wind whispering through tall, ocean-like expanses of grasses, swaying with great beauty, heedless of the horrors of the battle being waged in its midst. We see sunlight streaming through ferns and palm fronds, made all the lovelier by the gunpowder smoke lingering in the air.  And we watch a doomed baby bird knocked from its nest by the conflict, struggling pathetically on the wound-shattered ground.

Additionally, the music in The Thin Red Line also stuns with its glorious power. Sometimes used as a deliberate point of contrast to what is going on in a particular scene, the sounds of a Polynesian chorus singing a cappella during a moment of perhaps shatteringly sad death dispels the complacency of even the most post-modern of viewers, long-since hardened by the sight of thousands of previous on-screen fatalities.

The Thin Red Line is a war movie for those who say they revile war films. It is also a straightforward story of the reaction of humans separated from those they have known in their familiar lives, now facing the threat of direct extinction, which imposes states of hyper-reality and introspection upon them. It is unlike anything else done in American cinema in the 1990's, and it is a true achievement in excellence.",1168300800,12,3058,4.806083650190114

1024605,1,6305438137,"Thirteen year olds can be easily impressed by cheap tricks, ""heartfelt"" lyrics, and a lot of pretty lights. So it goes with some reviewers of this movie. This movie contains the unending internal reflections of about 6 or 7 different characters. These reflections never really go anywhere, never draw substantive conclusions. Primarily, there is just a lot of whining. THe only exception is the Sean Penn character until the end, when he whines at least as much as everybody else. ""War is tough"" is one of the main themes of this movie. Is that really a revelation?

One thing you learn early on in acting or directing classes is to ""play opposites,"" meaning put contrasting things in juxtaposition so that the contrast highlights both sides. An example is when a very evil character such as Richard III uses humor. ""I'll have her - but not for long."" THe fact that the guy is joking about killing his new bride makes him all the more evil to us. At the same time, perhaps we can't avoid laughing in spite of ourselves.

OK, so this director had some of the same classes I did, but he has to use the technique over and over and over and over and over and ... until it starts seeming boring and banal. War scene, lots of dying. Oh look, a pretty butterfly! More blood and bullets. Oh gee, the light going through that leaf is beautiful! Use this trick once or twice and maybe it seems new to the uninitiated audience. Use it more than three times and you are asking for trouble. This director must use it 10-15 times. He turns it into a cliche. When the audience can predict when they are about to see the next opposite, you have overdone it.

So what do we have so far? A bunch of whining character crying about war being bad and a bunch of contrast scenes. And really, that's pretty much it. The movie could have been cut in half with no loss because if there is one thing this movie is, It Is Redundant. It is spoon-feeding you the same message over and over and over again. Ouch, war hurts! Ew, mutilated bodies are yucky. Oh gosh, a little bird got hurt!!! We are so nasty! We must stop this war!!! (never mind the fact that thousands of little birds get eaten alive by cats every day)

The director focuses on the yucky and inconvenient aspects of war - which I suppose would be briliant, except I think almost everybody on the planet already knows that wars are yucky and inconvenient. It's almost as if the author doesn't Believe we know, that he somehow thinks we missed it. And if only he reminds us at every possible repetitive opportunity, again and again and again, well, then maybe we will ""get it"" and start opposing wars, I guess. Never mind about Hitler and the 6 million jews. Never mind about Pearl Harbor. War is a yucky thing done by bad men, or nice whimpy men trapped in a situation by bad men. It has no meaning and there is nothing remotely noble about it. We were just wasting our time fighting the Nazis. The Nazis were just misunderstood! If they want to cook 6 million jews in the ovens, let them do it.

An adult movie deals with realties and poses questions like, ""how do I get myself to do something that I don't want to do, but that I know I should?"" Making yourself do things that are not pleasant is one of the hallmarks of reaching adulthood. This movie takes a very adolescent perspective and asks, ""if I whine enough, can I get out of my chores?""

The dumbest scene in this movie is when the Jim Caveziel character is surrounded by Japanese and for no reason whatsoever, will not surrender. He stands there in the middle of about 40 Japanese soldiers and decides (after looking at some pretty leaves and butterlies) to raise his weapon so they will shoot him. The funny thing is, it's completely unnecessary: his comrades have already been warned. His death accomplishes nothing but relief for the audience - he can no longer utter his inane internal monologues.

I think if you are a left-winger or have a thing for looking at the bodies of naked boys, you will love this movie. It's the kind of propaganda piece that a vacant, unquestioning mind will eat up. If your leanings are more adult, however, you may hate it. You'll wonder why the story is so one-sided, why nobody seems to believe in the causes they are fighting for, even though the Japanese did attack us, and the Germans did some naughty things too. None of that seems to matter to the storyteller.

""Why can't we all get along?"" he cries, as the germans load another group of jews into the ovens and turn up the heat...

A final note: if you want to see two really good war movies that make valid criticisms of the ""war spirit"" and how wars are conducted, see ""Gallipoli"" and/or ""Breaker Morant."" These movies are extremely effective in making their points without using cartoonish characters. The characters are real and the plots move the story foreward.

""The Thin Red Line"" is what I would call ""professed brilliance."" A couple of simple tricks are used to try to impress the audience. But there is no real meat here. It's just a bunch of pointless whining. The poetry is poorly written and pretentious. And the characters are not real.",1161993600,11,5143,4.496788008565311
1024606,4,6305438137,"Terrence Malick's interpretation of America's invasion of Guadalcanal against Japan in World War II finally showcases just how insane the great real estate war really was.  Its hard to imagine that even in the midst of the post-modern era (the 1940's), wars were still being fought with 18th century tactics & mentality. ie; running up a hill without air support or ground cover is pure suicide. Its no wonder that millions of people lost their lives during this world wide conflict. The planet was being run by dictators and pompous generals hell bent on glory and the medals that looked good on their uniforms.

Lost in all the hoopla of a film that boasted such greats as Sean Penn (Hurlyburly), John Travolta (Pulp Fiction) and George Clooney (who by the way was about as memorable as his role was in the 90's television sitcom Roseanne) was Nick Nolte's (Affliction & U-Turn) performance as the blood thirsty Colonel that would stop at nothing, no matter what the human toll was to secure a hill and cement his personal legacy.  Nolte's performance alone will garner many repeat plays on your DVD player and should rank The Thin Red Line right up there with Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket or Oliver Stone's Platoon.

 The Start of the movie shows potential as two deserters are picked up and the marines head to gauadualcanal. unfortunately after they land the movie becomes various images of trees, birds,snakes,and little naked kids running around.

  Not My Idea of a war movie.

The acting is good but with all the voice overs it began to get difficult to figure out who was saying what. also the characters would appear then dissappear without any logic or reason.

 The action scenes (what little there is) are actually quite good, they woke me up a couple of times, but they are too brief and infrequent. I honestly could not tell what the director was trying to do with this film.

 if you are a fan of art house films with lots of hidden metaphors and meaning you would probably find this movie quite entertaining, I am not a fan of this type of film and the box was quite misleading to what type of film this was.

1024698,4,6305438137,"First things first: this is not a war movie. It just isn't. Though the movie has plenty of explosions and heroism, death and destruction, it's not about war, it's about humanity. Malick uses the vehicle of war - in which man is pushed to his most extreme; both in good and in bad - to explore what it means to be human.

If this sounds pretentious that's because it is. I assure you, there will be many points in The Thin Red Line's three hour running time that you will glance at your watch, impatient at the movie's slow, leisurely pace and other points when you will snort back laughter at the overblown - bordering on corny - voiceover dialogue. Yet, despite all the flaws, this movie manages to combine images and words into a true visual poem. A filmmaker's unique vision.

Malick asks questions that have been asked a thousand times before in a thousand different movies, but he does it in a way that will truly make you wonder about why things are how they are. There are a handful of moments in the film when the voiceovers and the action and the music the cumulative narrative force will overwhelm you and take you to another world, moments when you will forgive Malick for all of his faults and just sit there in reverie. And it's because of these approximately dozen transcendental moments throughout the film that I believe The Thin Red Line is essential viewing.

Still, I can't really wholeheartedly recommend any of Malick's films because of how highly personal each person's reaction is; there are perfectly valid reasons to love this movie and there are also just as many reasons to loathe it. You may like it or you may not, but as one of the only truly unique cinematic auteurs operating in Hollywood today, I think Malick deserves a chance.

If I'd wanted to see people philosophising, I'd have gone to a philosophising movie - likewise if I'd wanted to see art houses. As I can't be bothered reading a book about Guadalcanal, I expected this movie to fill me in on all the historical details of the battle. Not too much, mind you - after all, I am mainly interested in the visceral aspects of war and war movies, like explosions and gory death - just enough to provide my interest with a veneer of respectability. Actually, I did once read a book about Guadalcanal - another reason I don't like this movie. My father fought in the Korean War, and he walked out of this movie after 30 minutes - not the right war, he said. I thought it was the Vietnam war because of all the jungle and grass.

If I wanted to watch a documentary on the beautiful wildlife of the Southeast Asian Region I would have tuned in to the Discovery Channel. What does this have to do with a war movie?

The early scenes are set somewhere in Southeast Asia where a couple of deserters are fraternizing with the natives. The next thing you know, they are back on a troop ship heading to the Guadal Canal. There's no transition here. One moment these guys are on the beach. The next minute, one of them is being lectured by Sgt. Sean Penn about the morals of being a good soldier. Did I miss something in between or was it just a bad edit?

There are spiritualistic and to be sure, philosophical overtones throughout the entire film.

The movie unfolds not as a good novel would read but rather as some great and extended piece of poetry.

Along the way, you come to understand different soldier's perspectives from their various narrations of their thoughts about the war and their place in it.  The film flows as a segment of different character stories. Motivations are often revealed by way of the narrations or the character comes right out and says it.  This is the case for Nick Nolte's character.

The movie is a non-formulaic type of film. In other words, there really isn't a concise plot sprinkled with subplots, that wraps neatly up by the end of the movie like ""Platoon"" or "" Saving Private Ryan"" (also very good movies )  Rather, it's a 'this happened and here's the way events unfolded' story.......so, come along for the journey and get an unvarnished look at how it was, how it happened and what the men who were there did and what they were like.

The cinematography is majestic. The musical score is deep and true to the flow of the film.  The acting is wholly convincing and as mentioned above, the battle scenes and action is solid.

1024706,2,6305438137,"This past Memorial Day I felt like watching an American war film to honor American troops' past sacrifices, and so I decided to revisit Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line (1998), loosely based on James Jones' autobiographical novel concerning the American-Japanese war of Guadalcanal in World War II.

Malick is to moviemakers what J.D. Salinger was to authors - someone whose non-prolificity supposedly cements their status as a genius, to the point that whenever a new work appears, it's supposed to be a Masterpiece-On-Arrival.  Previously, Malick's only two movies were 1973's Badlands and 1978's Days Of Heaven, which gave him the status of being the only American movie director whose similar non-productivity the late Stanley Kubrick must've been deeply envious of.  Only whereas Kubrick maddeningly shaped his later movies in obsessively stark and direct and unwavering perspectives, Malick has taken to be the aesthetically amorphous and elliptical poet of American movies; his movies are not so much traditionally structured three-act stories as they are visual tone poems.

An impressive A-level Hollywood cast was assembled for Malick's first movie in twenty years: Nolte, Penn, Cusack, Harrelson, Travolta, with supporting work from Elias Koteas, Ben Chaplin, John C. Reilly, even a cameo by George Clooney; and although the majority of Adrian Brody's role was famously left on the cutting room floor, he can still be spotted hanging around the periphery.  This was also Jim Caviezel's big-screen debut, already playing a Jesus-like figure well before he grew out the beard and carried the Cross in The Passion of the Christ.

Malick has everything at his disposal: a stellar cast, immaculate production design and magnificent, almost-too-exquisite cinematography by John Toll.  So why, with so much going for it, is it such a profoundly unsatisfying experience?  Of course, the fault lies entirely with Malick's direction and screenplay (or rather, what passes for a screenplay).  The problems lie far beyond the (much-derided) pompous and insufferable multi-perspective narration, so incomprehensibly hokey in its quasi-`folksiness' that it makes Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath come off as positively Shakespearean in comparison; the cornball new-agey platitudes that we hear the soldiers `think' ala mind-screen on the soundtrack (as in Wim Wender's Wings of Desire) sound like they came right off the notebook pages of a lofty-minded and distracted third-grader in an elementary-school creative writing class.

Catching fleeting, 'poetic' visual epiphanies is Malick's stock-in-trade, what he's clearly most interested in about the filmmaking process and what he excels at - such as when the soldiers first arrive at the island and are walking through the woods fully armed, and an elderly bush-man appears out of nowhere, and walks right past them without saying a word.  Only Malick would have the inspired audacity to cut to a jaw-dropping closeup of a fatally wounded baby bird struggling in the dirt right in the middle of a momentous battle sequence, but he makes his basic (if overly simple) point: human war is an invasion of Nature's tranquility.  Moments like these are amazing to behold and leave you a little giddy; but that's all they're allowed to be - moments.  Not much coheres into anything remotely resembling an actual story, and you can bet that's just as Malick wanted it.

Malick revels in staging the combat of war in immaculately framed and choreographed compositions, but the drawback to this approach is that the audience is always aware of the 'artistically-inclined' guiding hand of the director (as opposed to the far more effective battle scenes in, say, Oliver Stone's Platoon, where Stone chucked any desire for fancy, elaborate cinematic compositions out the window and let his cameras come absolutely unhinged in depicting the totally chaotic, 360-degree savagery of war).  There is something vaguely distasteful in the way that Malick stages his battle sequences, with long 'dramatic' silences giving way to sudden crescendos (tsunamis) of violence and explosions, with his camera tracking hundreds of feet along the ground alongside the soldiers in the heat of combat in overly ""bravura"" stylistic cinematic flourishes.  The final assault on the Japanese bunker at the top of the hill that the movie has been marching towards for an hour is as meticulously choreographed and edited as a hyper-real John Woo shoot-`em-up; you can almost hear the teenage fanboys in the audience yelling, ""Awesome!"" ""Cool!""  ""Kick ass!""  We never lose ourselves as an audience in believing that a war is actually taking place; we are always completely aware of Malick the God-Like Conductor of Cinema summoning forth violence and hellfire with his cinematic baton, and that overly intentional aesthetic distancing is fatal to the movie's effect.  More often than not, you get the feeling that you're watching a Method-Actors' workshop in full costume at a faux-military paintball course.

With a cast this impressive, some of the performances are bound to be superlative, and Nick Nolte and Elias Koteas have the best exchanges.  As the insensitive, boorish, brazenly opportunistic Lietenant Tall, Nolte's underrated performance ranks with George C. Scott's in Patton and Robert Duvall's in Apocalypse Now of immoral, unchecked American machismo in the theatre of war.  Koteas' Captain Staros is the yin to Nolte's yang, a humanitarian pacifist willing to disobey the direct orders of his superiors in order to save his men's lives.  Both performances are career-bests and deserved Oscar nominations.  Ben Chaplin also does fine work as Private Bell, a soldier who vests his moment-to-moment fortitude in the thought of returning home to his wife; his later discovery (through written letters) that she has left him for another military man is one of the film's few (unintentionally?) comic moments.

Unfortunately, the rest of the cast is given scant material to work with.  As the one closest resembling a lead character in this ensemble piece, Jim Caviezel's Private Witt never moves beyond his doe-eyed, at-one-with-nature transcendental-satyr paradigm; in the unmerciful heart of war, he never discovers any hidden valleys of rage or grief or despair; he's too busy stroking the ferns and marveling at the wild wombats and koalas that seem to surround him wherever he goes.  (He might be the military variation of Antoine de Saint-Exupery's Little Prince, or the younger brother of Willem Dafoe's crucifix-posing Sgt. Elias in Stone's Platoon.)  Sean Penn, whose courageous performance in Brian De Palma's criminally underrated Casualties of War cut right to the most horrifyingly inhuman physical and psychological aspects of war, is given the standard old world-weary, hard-boiled, seen-it-all soldier part to play here.  Penn, the incomparably gifted actor's actor who delights in discovering new surprises in all in his characters, is here denied the opportunity to find any.  We never buy Travolta's General (with a maitre-d's pencil mustache?) for a second; and when other A-list performers like Cusack, Harrelson and Clooney appear out of nowhere, it's more of a distraction that rips away at the constantly slipping sense of authenticity.  Malick also seems to take a special glee in spending inordinate time with the character actor John Savage, who seems to have been directed to over-act in the most ""look-at-me-aren't-I-crazy-aren't-I-friggin'-nuts!?"""" method possible.  Watching Savage pouring soil out of his hands and muttering, ""we're dirt, we're just dirt"" is the uber-redundant cinematic and artistic equivalent of picking at one's bellybutton lint, and all you can think is, *this* is what Malick waited 20 years to film!?

Part of why I responded to Malick's latest movie, the underrated The New World, and his previous movies Badlands and Days of Heaven, more positively than this movie was because Malick wasn't afraid of spending time in the presence of female characters (Q'Orianka Kilcher's Pocahontas, Sissy Spacek's Holly, Brooke Adam's Abby, respectively) and taking more than a passing interest in their points of view.  Throughout The Thin Red Line, Malick cuts to dream-like images of the women in the soldiers' lives, i.e., the women ""back home"" - a mother, a sister, a daughter, and most often Private Bell's (ex) wife - but his directing of these scenes are so schematically staged and visually corny (a lady swinging on a swingset in particular is photographed like an ad for a feminine hygiene product) that they fall somewhere between embarrassingly amateurish and laughably pretentious.  (Ingmar Bergman himself might blush.)

As far as Malick's supposedly benevolent, god-like perspective on the senseless destruction and waste caused by humanity down here on the planet Earth, I found it consistently, profoundly and offensively hypocritical how genuinely jingoistic and pro-American this movie is.  There is NEVER a single moment in this 2  hour movie when the Japanese soldiers are seen as anything besides ""the Other.""  We see them, each and every one skinny and malnourished, manning their armaments, fleeing from the relentless American assault, beaten, ragged, crying, praying, mourning their dead, going insane from the horrors of war.  But we never meet a single Japanese character with any genuine sense of masculine assertiveness, or willingness to attempt to reach out and communicate with any of the American soldiers, or share a laugh, or a smoke.  Compared to the ideologically super-righteous mega-overdose of macho Yankee testosterone on display here, couldn't Malick have presented at least one single self-respecting Toshiro Mifune or Chow Yun-Fat to stand up straight, hold his own, to speak up for his men and his homeland, to proudly represent Japanese identity in return?

There is also a moment right after the final assault on the Japanese hilltop bunker that is deeply disturbing: an infuriated, hot-tempered American soldier beats up two Japanese prisoners-of-war, and shoots one of them point-blank in the chest in cold blood, and is dragged off the Japanese corpse by another American, all under the blank, unprotesting gaze of Ben Chaplin's traumatized Private Bell.  The basic implication is that war turns men into dogs, but Malick can't be bothered to spare even a second of grief over the murdered Japanese - the resulting impression seems to be that the director sides with the American soldier's just needing to ""cool off,"" and that, hey, terrible things are bound to happen in wartime, but why should we Americans bother dwelling on it?

The very best war movies - and the only truly moral war movies - make you hate war, neither of which Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now or The Thin Red Line succeed at doing in any lasting sense of the movie-viewing experience.  Rather, these are movies that DIG war - they dig the vibe, man.  For all its pseudo-meditating on the eternally heart-wrenching chasm between violence and peace on earth, it's excruciatingly obvious watching all the gloriously executed tracking shots and sweeping, painterly vistas of scorched earth in The Thin Red Line that for Malick, like Coppola before him, war is an aesthetic turn-on.  If Coppola was scared of being the only movie director out there caught in the act of making a spectacularly pretentious, pulpy, overly-simple-minded movie treatise on war with his bloated, shallow, comic-booky and fundamentally-wrong-headed Apocalypse Now, he needn't worry any longer - sans the druggy Jim Morrison vibes, Terrence Malick has matched his cinematic and moral delusions of grandeur to the fullest possible extent.  (In bitterly amusing and all-too-typical fashion, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences responded to this hubris by rewarding him, as they had with Coppola, with nominations for Best Picture, Director and Screenplay - honors not later bestowed upon Malick's vastly more enjoyable and culturally-empathetic The New World.  One wonders if Malick should've waited twenty more years to release that picture, instead of just seven, in order to clean up on the nominations at award time?)",1149033600,2,12199,5.348484848484849

Undeniably, the film was cast with great attention to how each actor would bring strength to the film, particularly the two main protagonists, Witt and Welsh.

There are many who dismiss the film as less than Saving Private Ryan which was released at the same time, but it seems odd to compare the two as films as each has a significant, yet different story to tell.  Weaving together this tale of voices from the perspective of several points of view must not have been an easy process, yet as we balance the whole of the film, it's an incredible accomplishment for such complexity.

While juxtaposed against the backdrop of a particular scope of time of war, the film reaches inward to examine the human psyche and the duality of man's nature.  While some critique as an inward spiral that does little justice to war films, this is much more than a film about the war of good and evil, it is the complex examination of war within the soul of man.

One of the reason I'm intrinsically drawn to this film is my own struggle with search for self and good in humanity, and the indelible moment that I recognize myself in these words...

1024784,5,6305438137,"In 1998, after a twenty year absence from filmmaking, writer/director Terrence Malick made his comeback with an adaptation of James Jones' World War II novel The Thin Red Line. The film's plot centers around the Allied invasion of Guadalcanal, a Pacific island held by Japan. However, Malick avoids conventional war movie methods and instead explores the nature of God, truth, courage, life, and death. War is simply used as a potent vehicle to examine these themes. What he has given us is a film with an intellectual impact that exceeds its emotional impact. It is truly in a class by itself and It wholeheartedly deserves to be acknowledged as a work of art of the highest degree.

 The Thin Red Line opens with perhaps the most beautiful fifteen minutes of movie I have ever seen. The first words we hear are ""What's this war in the heart of nature? Why does nature vie with itself? The land contend with the sea? Is there an avenging power in nature? Not one power, but two?"". While the camera shows us the unscathed beauty of the jungle and Melanesian natives living lives of simplicity and peace, we hear the In Paradisum from Gabriel Faure's requiem. It's as if Malick is trying to show us what God originally intended for us. We then meet Witt, an ethereal, spiritual army private who's AWOL and living in harmony with the natives. Relating the story of his mother's death, he says he ""couldn't find nothing' beautiful or uplifting about her going back to God. I heard people talk about immortality...but I ain't seen it."" After a poignant scene of Witt's mother's death, Witt wonders about his own: ""I just hope I can meet it the same way she did. With the same...calm. `Cause that's where it's hidden-the immortality I hadn't seen.""

 After he is picked up by a patrol boat, Witt finds himself confronted with the film's counterpart to his character, Sgt. Welsh. A hard-nosed, wry officer, Welsh deals with Witt's insubordination harshly. When Welsh asserts that ""In this world...a man, himself...is nothing'. And there ain't no world but this one"", Witt counters with ""You're wrong there, Top. I seen another world. Sometimes I think it was just my imagination"", referring to life with the natives. ""Well...then you seen things I never will"" is Welsh's cynical reply. It's made plain that Sgt. Welsh hates Pvt. Witt, but Witt states ""I never felt he hated me, `cause I don't hate him.""

 The ongoing interaction between Welsh and Witt serves as the backbone of the film, but many other scenes contain the same strange mystique. As Allied soldiers demolish a Japanese village during their prayer time, we see a fully human and distinct adversary, not demonized savages. In this scene, Malick is not concerned with good or evil. Instead, he steps back from that clich and simply shows the violent chaos of the battle. A very young private asks in a voiceover ""What's this great evil? Where does it come from? How did it steal into the world? What seed, what root did it grow from?""

 The Thin Red Line was released about five months after another large-scale World War II film, Saving Private Ryan. Comparisons between the two films, however illogical, were inevitable. Due to its far more conventional nature complimented by extraordinary quality, Saving Private Ryan found far more favor with the public eye and unfortunately solidified the public's low opinion of The Thin Red Line. But what really tipped the scales is our modern-day anti-intellectualism. A concrete battle of good versus evil is being fought in Saving Private Ryan, whereas The Thin Red Line prefers immerse itself in the why. In the latter film heroes, villains, sentimentality, reassurance and nobleness are all absent and the void their absence creates is not filled. Unlike almost any other movie, the questions presented here are not answered. The Thin Red Line forces us to think. How many films do that?",1136937600,11,3892,4.877458396369137

I really wanted to enjoy this movie because of all the wonderful things I had heard about it. Unfortunately, I was not as convinced as the rest of America seems to be. The Thin Red Line is a movie that tries to be many things, yet fails at most of them. The entire time I was reminded of other films that the director must have been using as primary influences, but it does not even come near to any one of them.

Any movie that you have trouble staying awake during is questionable, in my opinion. I found myself happily dozing during the middle scenes of this film--despite my best attempts to keep my eyes open. The film is entirely filmed 'in action' Thus, in the battlefield. The characters have voice overs that shed light into the introspection of a soldier which mimic the inner-monologue of noteworthy films as Full Metal Jacket and Apocolypse Now. The dialogue, however, seemed much more (to be kind) idiotic. This movie definitely falls under the category of ""Fartsy""? Thus, it tries to be artsy, but fails. And after it's over, you can't get the overriding stench out of your nostrils.

The storyline, however, does have its more intriguing moments. The very premise of a battle charge up a hill--sacrificing what men are necessary to achieve a single objective--is ludicrous to modern thinking. The senselessness of that charge embodies the true senselessness of that theater of war, the Pacific War against Japan. All of the men who lost their lives, only to have the President drop two bombs to render their fight worthless.

The character whom Nick Nolte plays is interesting as well. He plays the stereotypical career military man who has not seen ""the action"" his entire life and is in the sunset of his career. His authoriarian style of leadership is contrasted by the compassionate leader that refuses to charge his men up the hill into suicide. It is the leader who gains the respect of his troops that wins our hearts; not the cowardly Nolte who sends troops on ahead of him to blaze the trail. In fact, several of the characters provide a background for an interesting plot--and they certainly have the cast credentials to make it. With all of those big names, you'd think something would have come out of it.

All in all, The Thin Red Line tries to bite off more than it can chew and one certainly would not have wished it longer. It does not contain enough good & happy action in order to deem it an action movie; it also doesn?t contain enough (well done) anti-war work in order to deem it a dramatic piece about war. It might be worth seeing if you have a personal investment in the Pacific War against Japan (during WWII). Or if you need to catch up on some sleep",1133568000,,2815,4.599601593625498
1024786,5,6305438137,"I present to you The Thin Red Line. A little ridicoulos intro? Well this film deserves an intro that would be over the top, why you ask? Well I watched this when I was 9 years old, but got boured because there wasn't enough fighting like in saving private ryan.

But as I got older and more mature, I wanted to see it again. I have the DVD, so I took it out and decided to watch it, and am I glad that I went back and watched this awe inspiring movie.

Now For the overview of acting, directing etc.

The acting is sensational, there really isn't a best actor in this film, they're all brilliant in this film.

The directing is very good in this and has great locations. The script speaks for itself, and the cinematography is magnificent.

There really isn't an end to how good this movie is, so do yourself a favour and buy this.

ps the director is releasing a film that looks just as good. It's called The New World. Go check it out.",1131840000,4,937,4.177777777777778
1024867,5,6305438137,"Good war movies are for many reasons very difficult to achieve.  The same goes for war novels.  The reasons are too many to catalogue here, but it should be recognized that survivor's trauma is high among them:  the generation that saw it has real problems for this reason, and those that come later quickly lose or shun the context that could have opened the door to a particular war (however they may slouch collectively toward the next).

World War II has proven a very elusive subject in all the arts.  Taking film only, we have gone from the propagandistic films during and just after the war to the ""blockbusters"" like The Longest Day afterward.  Then there were the interesting but arcane -- Kelly's Hero's, etc.  If the European theatre caused trouble, the special horrors of the Pacific campaign yielded almost nothing of coherence.

Then came this sleeper.  James Jones had an eye and an ear, a big heart too, but was somewhat hysterical.  Now with a really exemplary film of that book that not only pays it tribute but indeed the greatest tribute (it surpasses it) that hysteria is finally coherent to me.  Plus I better understand things some veterans of the Pacific whom I have met could never say.  It makes the incoherence I always found in those men coherent, finally.  Sure, some of this is caught and reflected in the picture itself.  But it is caught with an extraordinary psychological realism that you at times forget is not live footage.  In about 10 minutes Nick Nolte justifies his entire filmic career as his men go after an impossible objective that makes the heart sink.  And this is also presented as a true tribute to the fighting men -- their privacy and sensibilities are not invaded by juicy shots of bodies blowing apart, unlike what was passing for ""realism"" just down the block when this film was made.  Anybody can feign realism and toughness with blood and guts, either in tough talk or cheap movie tricks -- and this is something the men of that war learned the hard way, brought home, and could never talk about.

Yeah some of the grunts are presented as goofy too.  Doubtless they were; maybe it makes some uncomfortable.  The vets who came back weren't that way anymore, but the novelist Jones remembered and gratefully the picture shows that too human quality too, warts and all, again without phony heroics or macho bs.

There is a lot of talk about the ""greatest generation"" now, we all know.  Well, see what James Jones aided by this director Malick shows, how they got that way, and the way they were just before, just after, and  during their cataclysmic transformation.",1128643200,4,2617,4.715859030837004
1024868,4,6305438137,"A good movie about about (perhaps) a not-so-interesting part of World War II. ""A Thin Red Line"" (1999) takes you back to the bloody campaign to take Guadalcanal Island in 1942. Adapted from the novel of the same name by James Jones (1962). The movie follows ill-fated Charlie Company in the big ships ready for field deployment, landing on the beach, walking through tall grass and various fields, setting up temporary camp(s), dealing with the thick jungle, taking a specific hill, disrupting an enemies camp, etc. All the while panning through visually stunning pacific settings (director of photography John Toll should have won the Oscar here for best cinematography). Several stories following the different main characters are woven together here in the mud. Conflicts arise and get lost in the fray (as quickly as some characters). In my opinion, this is a powerful, yet different approach to putting a war on film (perhaps in the same vein as Apocalypse Now). This film shows the chaios on both sides of the fighting. As good as a war film I believe this to be, I put it on the 2nd tier of films (****)... behind my favorite modern-day war movies - ""Platoon, ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Full Metal Jacket"", ""Glory"", ""Black Hawk Down"" and ""We Were Soldiers"". ""The Thin Red Line"" was honored with 7 Academy Award Nominations (and somehow received none): Best Picture, Director, Cinematography, Screenplay, Score, Sound and Editing. Perhaps the real story is the seemingly countless number of Hollywood stars to appear on the screen in the 170 minutes it takes to watch... household names like Sean Penn, John Travolta, Nick Nolte, George Clooney, John Cusack, and Woody Harrelson... but also look for bit parts by then new comers like Jim Caviezel (""The Passion Of The Christ""), John C. Reilly (""The Perfect Storm""), Adrien Brody (""The Pianist""), Thomas Jane (""The Punisher""), Jared Leto (""Requiem For A Dream""), Tim Blake Nelson (""O Brother Where Art Thou?""), Nick Stahl (""Terminator 3""), Ben Chaplin (""The Truth About Cats & Dogs""). No one actor steals the show here. Travolta comes and goes in the first 20 minutes; Clooney appears in the last 15 minutes; Sean Penn is scattered throughout. Nick Nolte delivers his best performace in decades; Caviezel grabs perhaps most of the director's attention with fine acting as well. Good movie, though long at just under 3 hours. No extra features on this DVD (you'll have to buy the special edition for that).",1127952000,4,2457,4.995121951219512
1024869,3,6305438137,"When I was a kid, I saw the movie ""A Thin Red Line"" with such stars as Aldo Ray and, if I'm not mistaken, Kier Dulyea.  It was a fairly good movie; full of action and a memorable ambush by the Japanese.  About 15 years ago I finally read the book by James Jones and discovered that the similarities between the book and the movie were that it took place on an island in the Pacific during WWII and involved US and Japanese soldiers.  The book was considerably better than the movie and served as the combat novel of Jones's excellent trilogy about a US Army Regiment before, during, and after WWII.  With this in mind, I looked with great anticipation to the new movie version of ""The Thin Red Line"" released in 1998.

There is much to appreciate about this movie but I could not help, from beginning to end, to wonder who the heck was given the keys to the editing room.  This film is a mess!  The scenes change almost at whim and often in a confusing manner.  It is pretty apparent that the director, Terrence Malick, was filming with the hope that something would emerge from the sheer volume of takes.  I say this because such ""stars"" as John Travolta and George Clooney had such brief appearances that it would appear 90% of their scenes were tossed.  As I would get settled into an appreciation of the flow of the movie, there was sure to be a sudden 90 degree turn confounding me once again.

Ironically, Billy Weber and and Leslie Jones were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Film Editing for their ""efforts"" in this movie.  This bizarre fact brings to mind the old fairy tale ""The Emporer's New Clothes"".  I assume it was so bad that people presumed it was some sort of a revolutionary approach and honored it as such.  Spare yourself the grief and enjoy the book instead; it stands head and shoulders above both of the movie versions.",1126828800,5,1850,4.43491124260355
1024870,1,6305438137,"How to make The Thin Red Line using ingredients that you already have at home.

Go the DVD cabinet, and select a copy of Apocalypse Now (make it a scratched copy).

Change the setting to pseudo-WWII (a bizarre mixture of movie-Vietnam and Guadalcanal).

Scrape the martial and historical accuracy even thinner.

Remove the continuous (or any) story line and throw it away with extreme prejudice. While you're at it, see if you can pick the metaphors out, grind 'em up with some cheap american cheese and chuck 1/4 back in.

In a separate bowl, prepare a gaggle of IQ 86 momma's boys with ridiculous southern accents. Give these pathetic losers associate's degrees in Whiney Voice-Over Philosophy from a local community college. Where possible, mix in some unrealistically pretty wives. Oh yeah - and make the guys juuust this side of insane.

Remove the interesting characters from Apocalypse Now and replace them with your new concoction. Mix randomly with some guns and pseudo-Japanese guys and see what happens. Try to get your pseudo-Japanese guys to pretend that they're IQ 86 momma's boys with associate's degrees in Whiney-Screamy Philosophy from an American community college.

Take a look at your sagging, greenish-brownish mixture. Try to gauge how much there is, and prepare an equal or greater amount of annoying flashbacks and tiresome voice-overs. It doesn't matter whose voice-overs you use. Be spontaneous. Now mix in the flashbacks and voiceovers. Make absolutely sure that you end up with a homogeneous mixture. For each five minutes of guys crawling around feeling sorry for themselves, there should be AT LEAST 5 minutes of a guy walking around very slowly, thinking very slowly and very loudly.

SIDE NOTE: For those of you who have not yet learned how to make a flashback, you have a greater chance of making them the Thin Red Line way. It's easy. Just shoot a lot of slow-mo ""action"" of depressed couples having extremely hot and fetid fully-clothed sexual tension. Shoot it all under obvious studio lights.

That's it! Just spread the mixture out as thin and long as you can get it, then bake for almost three hours.

Or turn it off early.",1126483200,15,2163,4.9502762430939224

1024872,5,6305438137,"At the time I sat down to write my review of *The Thin Red Line*, about 850 earlier reviews had already been published here at Amazon.  So what can I add that hasn't been said before, probably dozens of times?  Not much, methinks.

But I do feel moved to tell you that I've watched this film repeatedly since it came out in 1999.  Dozens of times. And I continue to love every long minute of it.

Now, I'll be the first to admit that I do understand quite clearly why *The Thin Red Line* is not to everyone's taste.  I know some of you reading this are sure to find it too slow, too lacking in action and bloodshed.  You'll say it wastes too much time with cloudy skies, leafy trees, pretty birds, flowing water, and other tiresome nature shots, yadda yadda yadda. It needs more whining volleys of bullets, spectacular explosions, spurting blood, and dismembered bodies thrown through the air.

If that's what you think I don't expect my words to change your opinion.  I can only repeat: I love this movie.  It is a work of art.  It is cinematic poetry.  It is the most philosophical movie I know of. Actually it goes beyond philosophy.  It is a mystical experience captured on celluloid.

Every time I watch it, it pervades my heart and my mind with warmth, wonder and depth.  The acting is amazing. The music is entrancing. In a word, it's beautiful.

Just what is *The Thin Red Line*? Well, it is surely no war film.  Or should I say, it's not *just* a war film. That's why nine out of ten war movie buffs are not gonna like it.

On one level, it is a film that questions man's place in nature. More precisely, while admitting that mankind has an inseparable place within greater nature, the film asks us why ""civilized people"" (men like the Americans and Japanese who are pitted against one another in merciless high-tech warfare) have lost sight of their place in nature.

These soldiers, all of them on both sides, are blind to the incredible beauty of the paradise island on which they fight. Just as much, they are blind to their own souls.

Some try try to find themselves and the beauty they've lost in the love of women. We meet one such soldier. He believes his wife to be the most beautiful person in the world, a woman he thinks is so trustworthy that he has given over his own soul to her. But he's betrayed by a ""Dear John"" letter. She's written to confess she's in love with an Air Force officer, and wants a divorce. In doing so she's just crushed her husband's heart. So can love of the opposite sex really be the way to find lost beauty and lost Self?

Some try to deny their Self and the beauty of nature as a mere illusion.  They resort to cold cynicism, as seen in the character Sean Penn plays. However, he's forced to grudgingly admit that he still feels for his men, even though it would be bliss, he says, if he could just stop feeling altogether.

Others try to embrace God, the father of nature.  ""Please show me how You see things"", one sergeant prays. So he becomes a witness to the death of every man in his platoon. And loses his mind to battle fatigue. Yes indeed, his prayer was answered, since God unblinkingly watches all of us die...but a taste of the God's-eye view of death was too much for this hapless sergeant.

No matter what they do, the mysterious war within the heart of nature and the heart of mankind remains a puzzle to all these men. So some of them throw in the towel, insanely screaming: ""We're just grass! Just dirt!""

It turns out that the question haunting *The Thin Red Line* is not merely, ""What's the right equation between man and nature?""  The fuller question is, ""What's the right equation between man and nature and God?""  In addition: ""What's the right equation between man and his own Self?""

The end of the film intimates that all these puzzles are created by the shining Self of mankind as a whole.  The full lesson of what this means is not revealed in the film.  It's a tantalizing clue, left for us to ponder as the final credits roll.

Have the Melanesian natives who seem so at peace with themselves--""The children here don't seems to fight with each other"" remarks the philosophical GI to the beautiful Melanesian mother--have these Melanesian natives who commune with nature, and who praise God in their lilting religious hymns--have these natives solved the nature-God-self equation? Do they, in this short human lifespan, ken their real purpose on earth?

Are they, as human beings, superior to the over-intellectual, technologically-sophisticated Americans and Japanese who use iron machinery to rape nature, defy God and commit mass murder upon one another? But who remain blind to Reality which *The Thin Red Line* makes so beautifully apparent in all those lovely shots of cloudy skies, leafy trees, pretty birds, flowing water, and happy island children?

Or is the answer wholly and solely locked within the shining Self of philosophical, civilized man?  The most soul-searching American seems sincerely inclined to explore that route.  His voice-over of introspective speculations about man, God and nature appeal to the thoughtful Western-trained minds of viewers of *The Thin Red Line*.

But what's really at the heart of his philosophizing?  It this not just Occidental individualism in intellectual form? As a product of Western mentality, can it really be a cure for the Western dysfunction? Is it not the same disease in cerebral disguise--that age-old, vain, incurable, totally futile exaltation of man's egoistic ideals above all else?  Can it not help but end in pitting mankind once more against nature, God and himself?

We never learn for sure.  But we do see our introspective hero buried in a nameless grave in the jungle, a few dismissive words uttered over him by his cynical sergeant. ""Where did your Soul get you?""

Meanwhile the jungle--Mother Nature--ceaselessly flourishes.  The happy islanders continue to find peace within themselves and with nature, singing their hymns to God.",1125187200,10,5984,4.702495201535509
1024873,5,6305438137,"To be upfront, I was turned onto this movie after digesting several quotes gained from various sources that were unlinked to the movie itself.  One being from a website and another other from an ""Explosions in the Sky"" song  titled ""Have You Passed Through this Night?""  Intrigued by the majesty and thought-evoking quotations, I researched to find their roots belonging in The Thin Red Line.  I am neither a war movie or even a movie fan, yet ironically I sat through the nearly 3 hours of this movie with attentiveness that was startling to even myself.  Beware violence-mongering-average-movie-goers: watch Saving Private Ryan for blood and gore.  The Thin Red Line centers around gorgeous dialogue and monologue; undoubtedly visually aesthetic, listening to a tape of the speakers would satisfy the theme more so than watching mute movement. Naturally occurring side by side with a death theme, A Thin Red Line touches briefly on religion, never coming out directly, but careful to include any possibility regarding post-life.  My favorite of the protagonists, Witt, is by far the most interesting character in a war movie yet; he lacks the typical gruff or fear that naturally characterizes a soldier in a war movie, and replaces it with inquiring philosophical aura that will shake even the most closed-minded perceptions.  More so than focusing on war, Witt pushes the idea that perhaps there is no evil or good, but one whole whom is not unable to produce both polarities.  Although the tone is inarguably morbid, hints of optimism are leaked from Witt, his final monologue summarizes the arching perceptions enforced by this movie:  ""Where are you now?  Who were you that I lived with, walked with?  The brother, the friend?  Strife and Love, Darkness and Light- Are they the workings of one mind, features of the same face?  Oh my soul, let me be in you now.  Look out through my eyes.  Look at the things you made.  All things shining.""  Tremblingly beautiful, Welsh's final words will render the avid viewer pensive and immobile, lost in thought;  however, it does relate back to the ""spark"" of hope that Welsh sees in everything, and confirms the lasting sense of happiness Welsh sees in human life, and death.",1124755200,,2223,4.95945945945946
1024874,5,6305438137,"The Thin Red Line is by far and without a doubt the best war movie I've ever seen.  Perhaps that's because it's far from being a typical war movie, spending just as much time on philosophical reflection as it does on action sequences.

Given the film's intention of being an inquiry into the ""philosophy of war,"" so to speak, there are some elements that are going to be quite different from what most war movie fans are used to.  For one, there is little character development.  The characters seem to serve as instruments to present the audience with different scenarios to ponder.  This is not to the detriment to the film, as the lack of character development offers a unique opportunity not offered by many war movies: the opportunity to escape catharsis (placing oneself in the situation of the character and seeing things from his perspective) and experience war from a de-personalized perspective.  This opportunity is important because catharsis in a war film limits the viewer's perspective as far as what sorts of things can be reflected upon.  One thing you really won't feel a lot of in this film, therefore, is an ""us vs. them"" sense of cheering for the Americans and hating the Japanese.  While there is more identification with the Americans because they are the main focus, the perceptive viewer will feel just as much sorrow for the Japanese, and their deaths will prove just as significant for reflection.  For this reason--and for many others mentioned by other positive reviewers--this movie is truly a gem.",1124582400,,1528,4.891472868217054

It is most definitely a war movie, depicting the American take-over of Guadalcanal from heavily fortified Japanese infantry, but (and that is a major but!), the battle is only a (very graphically-depicted) background (and interlude from time to time, as the movie switches to complete action) for an introspective look at the inhumanity of war (""where has this great evil come from?""). There are many phisolophical undercurrents that I still haven't understood in this movie, and I am getting ready to watch it again soon.

The filmography is really amazing, giving the movie a sort of dreamy-reflective mood, underlining the awesome and cold force of nature, with frequent shots of wind in fields of grass and wildlife fighting for survival.

That's probably the central problem I had with the film.  And there was this sense of things closing in around you, which may have been too overwhelming in retrospect.  Certainly that's a compliment now, though at the time I wasn't connecting it to the film internally.  It's a little difficult to explain.  The one scene that caught me by surprise in that sitting was the loading onto the landing craft.  There was something about that moment of the going, the getting into, the necessary steps...then the sense of the events and The Machine of war and destruction taking over, and taking these men to those fields.

I thought he was way off target.  I agree with him now.  The music and images and words of this film have stayed with me over the years and fermented within me.  With Saving Private Ryan, not so much.  Don't misunderstand me.  The viscereal immediacy of that film is gripping, and it certainly has its moments, too.  I own it on DVD and saw it twice in the theater.  Maybe I'm just having difficulty articulating what it is about The Thin Red Line, and perhaps why I keep editing this review over and over again.  I know it when I'm watching it.  The beauty the protagonist sees in everything might be what's rubbing off on this viewer.  Then there's Penn as a veteren sergeant.  His last scene having to listen to that BS speech from the new Capt (Clooney) is just classic.  The words at the end (Woody's character, again), drifting across the screen, trying to come to grips with how humanity can do this to itself and yet finding peace in existance itself, whatever it entails.  I think that's the kind of moment that will live on long after the shock and gore of Braveheart (good film, still), Starship Troopers (childish), or Saving Private Ryan has subsided.  It's poetry, and I usually don't even like poems.  But I'm certain that's the right name for these feelings.",1117929600,7,2318,4.536231884057971

1024917,5,6305438137,"""The Thin Red Line"" is a stunningly poetic and beautiful film. Terrence Malick is a true artist. I liked the contrast between the beautiful nature scens, and the horrors of combat. Malick's return should have been the event of 1998. Unfortunately for this movie, Spielberg released ""Saving Private Ryan"" first, and stole much of the thunder. While few people seem to like both films equally, in my opinion they are both masterpieces, and a highmark in their respective director's careers. The film is truly a visual wonder. And at it's heart, ""The Thin Red Line"" is more about spiritual conflicts than earthly battles. The cast is also a fantastic collection of great method actors,(and sprinckled with rising stars)who bring the grit every war movie does need. Nick Nolte especially is an essential part of what make some of the most important scenes work. Young Jim Caviezel gives a marvelous performance, and is the soul of the film. Every major Hollywood star wanted in on this. A few of the stunt castings really bothered me at the time-especially a bloated John Travolta as a Brig. General, and George Clooney as the division commander. Upon revisitation, they do good work, and no longer jar me out of the mood. ""The Thin Red Line"" is an unorthodox war film that transcends genre expectations. It stands today as a testament of film-making as art.",1114646400,2,1354,4.891304347826087

1024981,5,6305438137,"This is by far my favourite film.  Some people don't like it and I will make no attempt at ""defending"" it.  What follows is simply an explanation of what I love about this film.

The Thin Red Line (TTRL) follows a company of US army soldier (*not* marines, as one reviewer stated) around Guadalcanal, the ""turning point"" of World War 2.

I would argue that this film is not about the battle for Guadalcanal within the context of global politics.  This is a film about the collective experiences of a small group of typical Americans fighting for an island and survival.  It is also about memory and the insecurities that war presents people with.

It is really this last area that the film is most focused on, IMO.  Life and death is, of course, the most pressing transition point that is evoked in war.  This is not new territory for a war film.  TTRL deals with this insecurity with a myriad of different phenomena, from the destructive nature of combat to a soldier's reflections on the meaning of his mother's death.  What's most impressive is that TTRL explores this subject matter through a unique presentation of scenes that would otherwise be cliche.

For instance, Sgt. Welsh risks his own life to give a wounded soldier some morphine.  A brief exchange between the Captain and his Lieutenant brings up a recurring theme.  It is not just the theme of the meaning and morality of one's actions in war, but it also questions the identity of any given group itself  and thus the validity of a war which depends on an ""Us vs Them"" mentality (the line I refer to is, ""Well, fortunately Jim, the fate of the company doesn't depend on one man."")

Later in the film, Sgt. Welsh advises Pvt. Witt that there's nothing that Witt can do.  The irony when Welsh asks, ""What difference do you think you can make, one single man, in all this madness?"" is obvious, but the beauty of the scene is that Welsh says it earnestly and continues to say that, ""If you die it's going to be for nothing.""  The parallel here is wonderful.  The scene has used the irony of the comment on the earlier scene to raise another issue: since Welsh is serious (and not just an idiot who contradicts himself), this shows a parallel between the instability of the identity of a group and an instability of an individual's identity.  Where these scenes with Welsh illustrate these contradictions between group and self identity with death and combat, Witt's scenes explore these issues through peace and compassion.

Witt, arguably the protagonist of the film, sees a contradiction in the idea of a fixed group or self identity.  For Welsh, these contradictions are simply reminders of the absurdity of war, which is something that he's felt he's always known.  Seeing these contradictions through Welsh's eyes make for uncomfortable moments.  For Witt, these contradictions are beautiful.  Witt sees a continuity in all forms of life: we are all a part of something greater.  Yet Witt volunteers (thus risking his own life) to defend Charlie Company.  Witt is a peace loving man who bravely risks his own life and ends those of his ""enemies"" for his ""comrades"".

It is these issues that make up the main focus of the film, plus one other aspect.  As I have mentioned, Witt and Welsh see the same phenomena, but they have different meanings to both characters.  This makes up the essence of the most interesting and beautiful exchanges between these two characters and it characterizes the presentation of this film:  TTRL offers contradictory points of view.  The conversations between Welsh and Witt, where they are implicitly (and explicitly) discussing their different perspectives of the same phenomena are a good metaphor for this film.  This film offers a visual, poetic and sometimes prosaic discussion of different philosophies about life, death, war, hate, etc.

A voice-over at the end of the film is a good reminder of this: ""Darkness and light.  Strife and love.  Are these the workings of one mind?  The features of the same face?""

It is up to the audience to discuss these different points of view.  Just as Welsh sees bull**** and Witt sees beauty, one audience may hate this film and another may love it.  IMO, the greatest testament to this film's beauty is that it is still discussed with such passion.  Thus, I will firmly say that it is worth seeing at least once.",1110844800,7,4357,4.748335552596538
1024982,1,6305438137,"Welcome to the world of The Thin Red Line, where American Marines run around like chickens with their heads cut off, where they curl up into the fetal position every time the enemy fights back, where they delve into a few minutes of soul searching every time they fire a bullet in the general vicinity of a Japanese soldier, who looked like nothing more than your stereotypical Chinese migrant workers, according to this film. Wake up. I don't care what your artistic vision was, I don't care if this wasn't supposed to be an action film, I don't care if this isn't your average war film, THESE WERE REAL PEOPLE THAT DIED. I honestly don't care for that patriotic ""thanks for nobly sacrificing yourself for our great nation"" crap, but real people died in the battle for Guadalcanal, and the director does nothing more than throw dirt on the memory of the dead (both American and Japanese.)

Terrence Mallick needs to realize that that whenever you recycle the rediculously overused and cliched ""war is hell"" theme, you shouldn't beat it into the audience's head with a sledgehammer. Those here who say that everyone who didn't like it is too dumb to get the point, well, just stop talking because simply telling someone that war is hell will save them from three rediculously pretentious hours of flawed sentimentality that insults the memory of every single soldier, hell, anybody that died during World War 2.

Mallick is so wrapped up in his own cute little naive view of what war is like that he fails to grasp that a war film needs character development. I enjoyed films like Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers because the characters were well developed, they were believable, and above all, I could relate to them. I cared about the terrible experiences they endured, I cared when they died, I cared about what they felt. Mallick seems to think that characters take a back seat when you've got a grand artistic vision. Why should I care that Woody Harrelson dies from his own grenade? Why should I care that the main character basically kills himself? Nick Stahl, who only gets about two scenes - one where you see him in a boat, and then again you see him when he gets his very own five minute long death scene - is far too great an actor to be cast as such an underdeveloped, and more to the point, stereotypical ""scared kid in a battlefield"" role. And besides, any five minute long death scene is going to be bad, but it's even more so when you don't even care about the character that's dying.

It has good cinematography, but honestly, anybody that's taken a basic filmmaking class can come up with good shots when given scenery like that. Beyond that, there's nothing more to say. The Thin Red Line deserved to be buried by the far superior Saving Private Ryan (even though that had terrible moments of unbelievably corny patriotism,) because it disobeyed a very basic rule of making movies about war - you have to get the audience to care. All this movie did was ensure Terrence Mallick's status as the Michael Moore of filmmakers, in that he forces his opinions on the audience and makes them feel stupid for thinking otherwise. Grow up, Mallick. If you would've taken that advice, The Thin Red Line might have been something other than the spectacularly overrated failure that it was.",1109980800,22,3305,4.675257731958763
1024983,5,6305438137,"The Thin Red Line is a culmination of two great minds - James Jones and Terence Malick. Jones' novel is a great one, probably the best written by a civilian but it weaves such an intricate and finely detailed web that one would think it almost impossible to translate into celluloid without losing a great deal of its impact, however Malick's film of the battle of Guadalcanal is every bit as moving as Jones' prose.

Malick imbues the story with his own qualities as a director. If you have seen his film 'Days of Heaven' then you will know that he is a very visual director, as concerned with the intricacies of nature, of subtle movement and the dance of light as with the unfolding storyline.

For the most part though he manages to stay quite true to the novel and the strong characters in the book are brought wonderfully to life; Nick Nolte is quite simply perfect as Colonel Tall, that he didn't get an Oscar for that role invalidates the little gold statue as an award of any relevance. Perhaps the only major change to characterisation Malick makes is to that of Private Witt who develops a sort of shamanic insight into the horrific events that unfold around him as opposed to Jones' Pt Witt who is a more earnest Kentuckian.

The deep thinking Pt Witt in Malick's film allows the director to channell the universal themes ever present in Jones' novel through the character and hence he becomes pivotal in the telling of the tale, one in which the fight against a foreign enemy takes a back seat to the battle within the self.",1108080000,4,1537,4.541516245487364
1024984,4,6305438137,"During the summer of 1942, the United States launched its first amphibious invasion of the war against the Japanese.  The target was the island of Guadalcanal, located in the South Pacific island chain known as the Solomons.  The Japanese had constructed an airstrip, and if left unchecked, the Japanese could threaten Australia as well as the vital American supply lines.  This film depicts the struggles of Charlie Company, United States Army, during this bloody campaign.

An all-star cast, including Sean Penn (1st Sgt. Welsh), Nick Nolte (Lt. Col. Tall), Ben Chaplin (Private Bell), Jim Caviezel (Private Witt), John Savage (Sgt. McCron), John Cusack (Capt. Gaff), Woody Harrelson (Sgt. Keck), Elias Koteas (Capt. Staros), George Clooney (Capt. Bosche), Adrien Brody (Cpl. Fife), and John C. Reilly (Sgt. Storm), combine to re-create the bloody battle of Guadalcanal.

The film starts off with Charlie Company coming ashore to relieve the beleagured 1st Marine Divison, which was part of the original landing in August, 1942.  I was a little surprised at this particular part of the film.  In the movie, there was very little resistance from the Japanese to the landing.  When the Marines landed, the Japanese resistance was light because they were taken completely by surprise, but by the time the Army relieved them four months later, the resistance had stiffened, so I was surprised to see such little attention paid to this aspect of the battle.

Once ashore, Captain Starlos organizes his men to attack, capture, and hold a key ridge which is crawling with Japanese.  Starlos' superior officer, Lt. Col. Tall, wants an immediate frontal attack against the ridge, but Starlos prefers a more covert flanking manuver instead of subjecting his men to the ferocity of a frontal assault.  Polar opposites, Starlos, ever mindful of his valuable men, and Tall, the soldier who wants results no matter what the cost, clash over this issue, and Starlos refuses to obey the order.  Tall finally relents, but the seeds of tension and conflict have been sown.

After a prolonged struggle in which many of his men are killed, Starlos finally captures the ridge, much to the delight of Tall, who comes striding up the ridge with a big grin on his face.  He congratulates Starlos for capturing the ridge, but says nothing of the lives it cost.  The conflict between Tall and Starlos continues to boil until Tall finally relieves Starlos of his command.  Many of the men question the decision, but Starlos is happy to finally be out from underneath Tall and his gung-ho ways.  The battle continues to rage on until the survivors are finally evacuated, but the scars, both physical and mental, still remain.

This movie, direced by Terrence Malick, shows the terrifying effects of war, both physical and mental, and the strain they took on a young group of soldiers.  Malick effectively shows the gruesome effects of combat, from deadly physical wounds to such psychological factors as freezing up during a crucial time in battle, as well as the inter-company struggles between the men.  Malick earned an Academy Award nomination for his direction, while the film garnered seven nominations total.

This is a very good movie.  Despite some of the historical mistakes, such as the Army landings at the beginning of the film and the strange terrain in which the movie was filmed (Guadalcanal is a complete jungle island, while the movie was shot in wide open spaces with little or no tree cover), the battle scenes are executed very well, and the acting, especially by Nick Nolte, Sean Penn, and Elias Koteas, is excellent.  Watch this movie and see a hauntingly realistic view of militaty and moral chaos in the Pacific during World War II.",1106697600,3,3731,5.011345218800648
1024985,5,6305438137,"Since their releases in 1998, critics and audiences alike have asked whether Saving Private Ryan or The Thin Red Line was a better film. You can't really compare the two; one is a combat film and the other, more a meditation on the theme of war. Terrence Malick's 20 year hiatus has been one of the most puzzling occurrences in Hollywood history. He is back in prime form. Saving Private Ryan was a safer film to make, I think, because you have the firepower of Spielberg, the most successful commercial director in movies history and Hanks, arguably the most popular American actor today. But, The Thin Red Line has more ambition and a greater emotional impact. While the ending of Saving Private Ryan essentially compromised the film, The Thin Red Line draws no clear conclusions, and is perhaps intentional. Malick had enough influence to gravitate so many great actors for this project and makes a good selection in Jim Caviezel, who illuminates with a sort of holy aura.

Of course, nothing made by Malick is set by convention and this film is no exception. It is told essentially through multiple voice-overs and parallel plots. The soldiers are recognizable only by faces as we struggle to hear their names through the sounds of combat. The meditation exists as the narrator sort of floats above the action, acting either as an ominiscient being, or one who's voice is filled with questions. Many people have said that Saving Private Ryan was a more accurate WWII film, but I disagree. By Hollywood convention, Ryan sets up some characters and poses multiple situations where they explain who they are and what they did for the sake of the audience, but The Thin Red Line essentially throws these characters into dire situations and allow us to figure their roles out.

There are good roles in this film, especially those of Nolte, Caviezel, and Penn. Caviezel is essentially a pseudo-Christ figure and his dialogues with Penn are some of the film's best. Nolte is effective as a macho, hyper-masculine CO who possesses some nice silences between his fits of screaming.

So does Malick succeed? I don't believe this will be a commercially successful film and some of Malick's self-indulgent imagery falls flat or irrelevant. Hollywood may not be ready for such a film and neither will audiences. Despite all that, I believe it is the year's best film and ranks with Apocalypse Now as one of the best war films of all time. It is more ambitious than any film you will see in a long time.",1105920000,2,2493,4.793023255813954
1024986,4,6305438137,"This film is based on James Jone's novel of the same name.  If you aren't familiar with Jone's style of writing, he is different in making setting and plot take a back seat to theme and characterization.

This film, like the book, trys to capture the chaos and insanity of war in a different way.  In many war films in the past decade,(SPR, Enemy at the Gates, We were soldiers, windtalkers... the list goes on), the magnitude of war is shown mainly through battle sequences.  They follow the same guidlines.  They ALWAYS give the main characters a distinct and important purpose.  The objectives are clear and everything is black and white.  At the end of the film, said purpose is accomplished by the main characters which will give most viewers satisfying closure to the what they just seen.  Effective; but war isn't  black in white.  The grayness is made evident in The Thin Red Line.

In this movie, the battle for Guadal Canal is nothing more than a  backdrop.  The men in C-for-Charlie see the island as a hell hole out in the middle of the ocean.  For the most part, they are afraid and unsure of themselves.  Each individual wonders how he will hold up when the bullets start flying.  However, that is only half the struggle.  Not only do they have to fight the japs, but they also must deal with the psycological effects that the situation they are in causes.  It is made worse that there is no crystal clear goal or sense of purpose to achieve.  No answers.  Just questions.  Questions that they don't have answers to.  Each man wonders if he will survive.  How will the war change him?  How long will it take before death and dying become common to the point where it is no longer dwelled upon?  Will combat trigger the animal or coward within him?  He doesn't know.  When the battle for Guadal Canal is over the survivors are changed.  But there still are questions.  The nightmare continues for the survivors because there are more islands to take.  The reality of war remains.  The only certainty is that war is cruel and must be dealt with through the sacrifice of whatever humanity is left in him.  Though the battle is fought by many men, the movie leaves you with one realization.  Every Man Must Fight His Own War.",1105142400,,2235,4.54911838790932

Beautifully shot in the South Pacific, and featuring brilliant performances by an all-star cast, this is a film that probes deep philosophical issues while following the paths of soldiers engaged in the battle for Guadalcanal in WWII.

One of the issues that divides many viewers is its position as a war movie released in the same year as Saving Private Ryan. Undoubtedly, those who went to see this movie hoping for ""Saving Private Ryan in the Pacific"" came away bitterly disappointed. Let the viewer beware, The Thin Red Line is no more a ""war movie"" than the Iliad is a ""war book"". Both use the context of war as a theatre in which to explore some of the central issues of mankind - love, honor, courage, self-sacrifice, individuality and camaraderie. There are few other movies as deeply packed with philosophical baggage, and were it not for the frequent pauses where the camera simply lingers on scenery and wildlife, or follows the quiet moments in the characters lives, this movie would surely overwhelm most audiences.

In the years to come this film will be remembered as the masterpiece it is unlike the other overrated films of the 90's. Mallick is amongst the great directors such as Kubrick / Peckinpah / Scorcese / Leone etc, and im glad to hear that he is making a new picture finally ""The New World"".

I have heard some complaints about the blur of characters, but that just served as a way of showing me that these men are in the same position. Besides, the actors were superb, and towards the middle of the movie, I learned how to distinguish between characters.

Malick captures the extraordinary sense of the jungle by using a montage of brief shots on light filtering through leaves, on the various creatures of the jungle and on the far-reaching plants. I suppose that is partly why I love the movie so much. There is a great juxtaposition of beauty and violence.

I also thought that ""The Thin Red Line"" might be something like ""Apocalypse Now,"" a dark commentary of the twistedness of war. ""The Thin Red Line"" does explore the dark depths, but it is much more subtle, nearly serene in its take that feels profound.

All in all, this transcends the typical ""war film"" genre and comments on what drives people together and apart.",1101859200,2,1053,4.743169398907104
1025077,4,6305438137,"THE THIN RED LINE (TTRL), writer/director Terrence Malick's Oscar-nominated World War II drama based on James Jones' book, is notable not only for its introspective approach to its subject, but also as the film that was initially supposed to make Adrien Brody a star in his pre-PIANIST days. Brody trained at boot camp for his portrayal of Cpl. Fife (the character based on James Jones himself) and was hyped to the skies as Hollywood's Next Big Thing. No sooner was Brody included on the cover of VANITY FAIR Magazine's 1999 Hollywood issue than he discovered that many of his scenes, chiefly those involving dialogue, wound up on the cutting room floor. I got the feeling that Brody wasn't the only TTRL cast member victimized by the editing process, though. While Sean Penn, Ben Chaplin, and Jim Caviezel have substantial screen time as the audience gets to see and hear their thoughts, the rest of the all-star/star-to-be cast come across as extras in their own movie, with everybody from John Cusack to John Travolta to Nick Nolte to George Clooney (among many others) getting one or two memorable scenes at most and then moving right along. Perhaps that's Malick's point; maybe he's saying that combat dehumanizes men until they're just walk-ons and bit players in the theater of war. This might also explain why most of TTRL's characters have one-syllable names that soon start to sound alike: Welsh, Whyte, Witt, Fife, Gaff, Tall, Tills, Bell, Doll... Indeed, as the soldiers of Charlie Company become increasingly filthy and exhausted during their traumatic tour of duty in Guadalcanal (some of it filmed on location), it gets increasingly difficult to tell one from the other. As my husband Vin and I played ""Spot the Adrien,"" Vin kept thinking he saw him because, as he said, ""It's like *everyone* in this movie has thick eyebrows and big noses!"" Once you actually spot Brody in TTRL, however, it's hard to forget him, and I'm not just saying that because I'm a fan of the man. While Brody doesn't say a word until the final reel (Vin and I were amazed: ""Finally! Brody speaks!"" :-), his expressive face and eyes and his considerable screen presence make up for his lost dialogue as he hovers anxiously in the background; Brody haunts the film like The Ghost of War Past, Present, & Future. You'd think they'd release a special-edition DVD with Brody's cut scenes, now that he's an Oscar-winning star! :-) Even if you're not on the lookout for your favorite actors, TTRL dazzles the eye and touches the soul with imagery that is at once grim and poetically beautiful, as well as poignant Melanesian native music that acts as a moving counterpoint to the soldiers' ordeals. If you're looking for rock-'em-sock-'em action and people getting blown up real good, you may find yourself getting impatient at TTRL's leisurely pace and 170-minute running time, but if you like your war movies intelligent and thought-provoking, TTRL is worth a look.",1100822400,4,2952,4.906
1025078,5,6305438137,"Martin Scorsese, one of the greatest directors ever to breath, stood firm in naming The Thin Red Line as one of the top ten most important films of the 1990's. I couldn't agree more.

The Thin Red line is an incredible achievement. It doesn't take half a brain nowadays to create an all out action fest, with fast editing and mindless violence. Malick stands out on his own and selectively chose a film that concentrates on then internal war of the mind, which just happens to be in the center of a physical battle. These soldiers are men who have had entire lives, that actually take time to breath and think, unlike the incessant impersonal views many ""war"" films have. They dwell on their loves and wonder about death, feel the groanings of guilt as they pull the trigger, and sometimes the excitement of seeing the enemy fall.

I more than understand why someone wouldn't care for thin red line, because it is a somber 3 hour experience that relies mostly on hearing minds that say exactly the opposite of what the bodies are doing. I have watched it a dozen or more times, and no one that's watched it with me could stay awake. I do understand. Its an acquired non-popcorn movie taste, that many would rather not stomach. Thats fine. But, for these reasons, I love it more.

Many men ponder on the purpose of this war they're fighting. ""Where is God in all this,"" one soldier dwells as he gazes at light shining through the jungles thick canopy. Many fall, faces come and go, but all are part of the same brotherhood.

God was there, as the men fell. Once they reached him, he had the answers to the many questions held in the Thin Red Line. ~saos~",1098921600,6,1653,4.48172757475083
1025079,5,6305438137,"I never saw this film in theaters, and that has been one of my biggest regrets when it comes to films I should've seen on the big screen in surround sound.  When it came out, all the hype and attention went to ""Saving Private Ryan"" and it took me months to work up courage to see that film.  After the violence of that film sickened me, I wasn't in any mood to see other war films for a long time (until the recent war in Iraq sparked an interest in learning what our soldiers are going through now).

In hindsight, I wish this film would have won the Best Picture Academy Award in 1999, instead of the surprise win, ""Shakespeare In Love"" and the predicted favorite, ""Saving Private Ryan"".  ""The Thin Red Line"" balances the war scenes with scenes of imagineable beauty, from the animals and the beautiful South Pacific island landscapes and it makes for a much more pleasant viewing.  I believe the director might have done that to contrast the brutal cruelties of war with the ironic beauty of their surroundings...that it makes one wonder why people kill each other when they should be enjoying and preserving nature.

This film reminds me of the older war films, which were a who's who among actors.  This film manages to enlist the new generation of actors making a name for themselves in Hollywood today (Jim Caviezel, Adrian Brody) as well as stellar performances from Sean Penn and Nick Nolte.  The intro scene, with Jim Caviezel cavorting with natives of some South Pacific island in what appears to be AWOL, was brilliantly done and set the tone for the rest of the film.  The music and especially the singing of the Melanisians were outstanding!  There is a certain spiritual lift one can get from listening to these simple people sing, and to see how they live in a true community.  Who wouldn't want to drop out of a war to live the rest of their lives among these peaceful people?

Though the film is long, it's worth watching because of the performance of Jim Caviezel and the overall message and tone this film ultimately conveys.  The DVD is worth adding to one's collection, especially for the special feature in which you can play the Melanisian songs as a CD and listen to all the tracks like a regular CD.  Its about perfect to meditate to, do chores by, or just relax in its sonorous serenity.

Penn, Caviezel, Koteas, and Nolte deliver performances that are beyond belief and the supporting cast is stock full of professionals.

Now even though it is a psychological study more along the lines of The Red Badge of Courage it delivers some great action sequences as well. It just has more meat to the story than it's peer Saving Private Ryan. The characters aren't all american boys in the strictest sense but they are ""real"" people with real problems.

It is not for those that are looking for a glorification of war however. Odds are that if Saving Private Ryan is your favorite war movie that this one will not be your cup of tea. It is more in the vein of Apocalypse Now and Platoon.",1096243200,3,858,4.424050632911392

1025083,1,6305438137,"Some reviewers have called this movie realistic. I think they're right. It is a realistic depiction of a drug-addled director's view of Guadalcanal. The only military action depicted is American action against Gifu strongpoint, and not the much more significant American defense of Henderson field, where the bulk of Japanese forces were annihilated. Combat scenes are hallucinatory, both from the standpoint of camerawork and its departures from what happened as described by actual participants in the battle and official history. For instance, the movie depicts the attack as occurring across grasslands. In reality, dense jungle impeded the advance of the American Army's 25th Division every step of the way. Japanese defensive positions were invisible until US troops were within 15 feet. In the end, tanks were needed to end the bloody stalemate. None of this is shown in the movie.

The director seems to be trying to make the point that war is stupid. In this respect, there are far better and more coherent movies, such as All Quiet on the Western Front and Go Tell the Spartans. It fails both as a war movie and as an anti-war movie. On the other hand, if you ever find yourself wide awake at two in the morning, just pop in this DVD and minutes later, zzzzzz.",1091836800,15,1270,4.906976744186046
1025154,1,6305438137,"Sometimes I believe in solipsism. You have to at least consider it after viewing a show such as this. I don't mean solipsism as defined as total self-absorption, I'm referring to the somewhat uncomfortable feeling that one exists alone and the rest of world only lives in the mind. And in a paranoid turn I may consider the fact that I am a sort of guinea pig being manipulated by some force majeure, a la `The Truman Show'. How else can you explain such soi-disant `art' films, such as this and `Blue Velvet'? It can only be some omnipotent being whose maniacal experiment is to test the reaction of a human who witnesses a film that is uncommonly bad, only to see it incongruously praised by strategically-placed chimeras (that would be the majority of the posters here).

The `reality' of the matter is that the `Thin Red Line' is bad beyond the pale. It is a discursive mess wrapped snuggly in sweeping camera work. It is overwrought and ponderous. Its attempt to achieve surrealism is forced and achromic. And if I may be so priggish I should point out that the filmmakers fail to observe a simple rule in moviemaking by making the characters indistinguishable. Here the dramatis personae look so much alike, and are so inconspicuous we are left with a turbid jumble.

The clat camera shots make this an ostensible `masterpiece', but the other aspects of the film reveal a convoluted, insipid work. At least that's one person's (if I really exist) view.",1091750400,13,1458,4.713725490196079

1025156,4,6305438137,"A lot of people were surprised when Line racked up seven Oscar nominations, including one for Best Picture, the year that Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan raked in the bucks and the critical acclaim. Watching Terence Malick's long-awaited followup to Days of Heaven yesterday, I thought a lot about how boldly contemplative, achingly beautiful, and curiously flawed it was and came to a realization: I'd watch this one again before I did Ryan. In an age where modern films have the license to be as complex or manipulative as they want, here comes Terence Malick ready to make a 'war' movie: except, this one carries little logistics, plot, or superficial character development. What Line has in spades, though, is the ability to create a beating heart and soul for those young, scared men who braved the deadly shores of Guadalcanal. There is little dialogue, big-name stars have less, and the movie has the same gorgeous fascination with the natural world as Heaven.
  What makes Line an arguably more fascinating journey than its same-year WWII flick is that dive deep into the soul that it attempts, and usually succeeds, to make; for proof, look into Jim Caviezel's eyes at any time during the movie. Yes, being a movie that reaches high for metaphors and philosophical musings, it does veer dangerously close to pretention (the voice-overs being the shakiest issue). Not to mention that the movie is three hours long and many characters never advance beyond a faintly recognizable face. I view pretention, though, as a flashy device used to disguise emptiness...and there isn't really any empty moment in the film. The Thin Red Line is far from perfect, but it's as close to capturing the spiritual and philosophical side of war than any movie I've seen. GRADE: A-",1089936000,8,1776,4.976430976430977

1025159,5,6305438137,"I saw ""The Thin Red Line"" on its opening day, Christmas of 1998, at the classic Coronet Theater in the heart of San Francisco. When the film ended it took time for my mind to begin digesting what it had just experienced. It seemed that half the people leaving the theater at the end of the film acted as if they had just been touched by a vision from God; the other half were shaking their heads in disappointment over not being served up a more gung-ho, colored-by-the-numbers, Ramboesque war film.
In the late 1990's (in the era of what I've come to call the ""Pax Clintonia) it was hard to imagine our country ever being in a war again with the likes that we've seen in this Spring of 2004--with battles marked by ugly guerilla warfare and attrition of a scale not seen by US forces since Vietnam.
Now amidst an era of full-scale war ""The Thin Red Line"" resounds even more powerfully than when it first came out. I can only believe that it speaks directly to the fears and struggles of the fighters on both sides of the current Iraq conflict--whether they be troops of the US and our allies, or those who oppose us from the anti-coalition side. As well as to the non-combatants caught up in all of the hell of this war as well.
In the discussions over ""The Thin Red Line"" it is often compared and contrasted to the other big 1998 war film ""Saving Private Ryan"". I think it is fair to do so as it is to compare and contrast different pieces of, say, literature.
I still do admire ""Saving Private Ryan"" (at least from afar) and cannot discount the views of those who like it better than ""The Thin Red Line"" and believe that Spielberg's film falls more within their vision of what a war movie should be. For me, however, the effect of ""SPR"" has receded within me as time passes. Though it is an extremely well-made film, what strikes me is the sheer conventionality of so many of the plot elements in ""SPR"". I mean haven't we seen so much of what happens in ""SPR"" before, in classic World War II film after film such as ""The Longest Day"" and ""Battleground""--but with a new layer of realistic gore for the 1990's? This is one reason why ""SPR"" never truly entered my psyche the way ""The Thin Red Line"" did.
And speaking of the bloodshed I do agree with the assessments of those that see something somewhat voyeuristic about some of the scenes of anatomically-detailed violence in ""SPR"". I think that this sort of violence marred and unnecessarily distracted from otherwise fine films like ""Blackhawk Down"" and ""We Were Soldiers"". Scenes practically designed to make the audience exclaim, ""Ooh, look at what just happened to that guy's hand!""
The violence in ""The Thin Red Line"", in contrast, NEVER feels exploitive--and never has a hint of ""war pornography"". Instead ""TTRL"" has a uniformly mournful, tragic tone. A sensibility that is not cynical, sardonic, and mean-spirited towards the world as in ""Full Metal Jacket"" by Stanley Kubrick (whose work some people compare Terrence Malick's with), but sorrowful about the tragedy built right into the fabric of a world that has never known a time without war. And Malick does not single out anyone as a true villain (even Nick Nolte's Colonel Tall is shown as a self-loathing man in his voice-overs); he simply says that this is the way of life, laments all this suffering--and poses many more questions than he tries to provide answers about why nature and the universe are so cruel in this way.
So many of the images in ""The Thin Red Line"" will live with me till the day I die. For instance all of the sequences involving Ben Chaplin's character (Private Bell) and his beautiful wife (played by Miranda Otto). I still feel the spell of the particularly striking scene where the camera is upside-down so that Mrs. Bell appears to be swinging into the sky like an intangible sylph that cannot be held onto--and indeed she eventually becomes lost from the arms of Private Bell, the one person or thing that has kept him going through all blood and destruction all around him.
The scene of Private Witt's demise also stands out--Jim Caviezel's entire presence in the film itself a stand-out. For me it represents idealism destroyed by crushing reality but also the hope that there is something spiritually transcendent beyond death.
And the last shot of the coconut sprouting up one new baby palm--a ""life moves on"" image that at first left me somewhat befuddled when I first saw the movie--has now indelibly joined the pantheon of haunting film endings for me. All of the chaos and insanity and horror that have preceded this final scene have ebbed away and left on the beach a brief fleeting moment of gentleness and tranquility.
If some movies are fast food this ambitious, poetic, multi-dimensional film on the other hand is a gourmet meal created by a master chef that takes many visits to fully savor and appreciate its different courses. As I evolve, as I age I experience something fuller and deeper each time I revisit this film that only grows ageless with the passing years--whose impact we find in full force during this time of war.",1085529600,9,5088,4.64190687361419

Our units in Vietanm were constantly changing as personnel rotated in and out, thereby denying us any long term comaraderie. I too lived through the memories of my life before the war while in combat, remembering what it was like to be 'normal'. War changes you in ways that I do not believe have been adequately addressed in any major films to date. Each in it's own way has it's strengths and weaknesses. This film however touches your soul. There are so many scenes in this film that can cause a flashback, the reality of war and combat come true. There is a certain sense of credibility here.

The Thin Red Line follows a company of men through the battle for Guadalcanal in the Pacific theatre of WWII. While these men are not part of the first wave of the invasion, they still encounter a considerable force of Japanese infantry within the island. There are far less battle scenes than Saving Private Ryan - which was released at nearly the same time as TRL - and the battle scenes that do take place in this movie are on a far smaller scale.
However, action is not at as important in this movie. The Thin Red Line chooses to focus less on the battle between armies, and instead on the battle that each soldier faces within himself during their experience. The narration - although a bit too poetic at times - does an excellent job of bringing the viewer into the mind of each major character in the movie. Character development is not deep, but is largely unnecessary. You get a good feel for each soldier's personality through his thoughts, and his actions. There is not a single bad actor in TRL.
Like I said, poetry is very heavy in this movie. At times it didn't seem to make any sense to me, but I constantly found myself pondering what was said, and finding ways to apply it to what was going on in the movie. I soon realized that never once during the movie did I stop thinking about what each soldier was going through in his own personal hell. After all, the Pacific theatre was where the American military saw some of its highest casualty rates in the war. The soldiers' fear was very well portrayed in TRL.
The camerawork is also excellent. It's very gritty when it needs to be, especially during battle scenes. There are also loads of still shots of wildlife, the land, and its natives. I found that it created a sense of life for the environment in which the soldiers were fighting. Even as men were dying in this place, nature continued on as if nothing were even happening.
If you are dissuaded from seeing the TRL because of some viewer's descriptions of it as an ""anti-war"" film, don't be. I never once felt that this film set out to demonize the war effort against Japan. However, TRL does show quite a bit of suffering on the part of both armies. That's the way it really was. Americans were not the only ones who suffered terribly in the great war.
I really would like to write more about this movie. There are so many good things that I could say about it, and almost nothing bad. Just rent it. Watch this movie with the intent of examining every scene, and listening to every word that is said. I guarantee you will be thinking about this film for days on end.",1080864000,2,2776,4.361003861003861
1025237,1,6305438137,"What a waste of my time and an all-star cast. While picking up several other DVDs, I spotted this movie and remembered what an interesting collection of actors were in it. To say that I was thoroughly disappointed after watching it would be the height of understatement. What a meandering, unfocused waste of celluloid. David Lynch films make more sense and get to the point (if any) sooner. I was hoping that things would eventually pick up once George Clooney appeared but that was not to be. He shows up right near the end of this 170 minute snoozer and has about a minute of mostly backround dialogue (during a voice-over) and even less screen time. What a shell game. I will give this movie it's props for being beautifully filmed and having a good soundtrack though. I can only hope that that's what 5 of it's 7 Academy Award nominations were for (somebody was either smoking dope or taking payola to have nominated this dog for Best Picture and Malick for Best Director). Was 1998 that much of of a wasteland? Obviously so. Thank God Spielberg was busy that year (and knew what to do with 170 minutes of your life). In his interview on the special edition of Angel Heart, Mickey Rourke says that Malick filmed some scenes with him that ended up on the cutting room floor. I don't think that even that could have revived this flatliner of a movie. Brody, Caviezel (who dies in this one too - sorry), Chaplin, Clooney, Cusack, Harrelson, Kotas, Nolte, Penn, and Reilly deserve better then this. I can only hope that they were all well compensated for their time to have this clunker stink up their resumes. Thin Red Line? No, Nonexistent Story Line is more like it. By the way, if a special edition/director's cut ever comes out with the missing Mickey Rourke scenes, I'll be the first one in line to get it but I doubt that'll change my mind. I personally hope Malick takes at least another 20 year hibernation to cobble together a coherent version of this film using any deleted scenes or has the courtesy to keep his masturbatory cinematic excesses to himself.

Two decades later he returned to make the second version of ""The Thin Red Line.""  What was true for his first two films holds true here.  This film collected 7 Oscar nominations, great critical praise, but it didn't win any.  Another film by the title of ""Saving Private Ryan"" steamrolled right over it, as did the film that eventually won the Best Picture Oscar that year, ""Shakespear in Love.""  The style of this film is also reminiscent of Terrence Malick's first two endeavors.  When it was initially released in theaters a co-worker of mine was telling me about it.  I knew of Terrence Malick's two other films and I quickly asked, ""Is there any sort of narration or voice-over in the film?""  My colleague was a little puzzled because he knew I hadn't seen the film yet, and then he realized I was correct in recognizing a pattern.  Many film directors leave an unmistakable stamp in their movies.  Martin Scorsese is an excellent example, as well as Steven Spielberg.  I named those directors to illustrate that I think Terrence Malick is a superb filmmaker as well.  The largest difference between this film and his earlier work is the sheer size of the cast and production.  Just looking at the cover of the DVD shows how much respect so many ""name"" actors have for this fine director.  Many of which took cameo roles just to be a part of the project.  The story takes place in the South Pacific during World War II.  All the battle scenes scream with authenticity and emotion, while the quieter moments are filled with objective, philosophical narration from many characters.  The latter moments are where my only real criticism lies.  It was confusing at times which characters were in deep reflection about life, death, the choices we all make when considering our fellow men.  A little narration is okay here and there for flavor or clarification, but in this film there were many scenes where I thought, ""The tail is wagging the dog.""  Other than those moments, however, this is a very stong film with brilliant cinematography from John Toll and solid direction from Terrence Malick.  I want to emphasize that John Toll's work here is sparkling, and was one of the 7 nominations (Best Cinematography).  He has won the Oscar for Best Cinematography twice before: for ""Legends of the Fall"" in 1994 and for his stunning work in ""Braveheart"" in 1995.  So, as you can see, I'm not the only one who thinks his work is excellent. Thank you. I hope my review was informative and helpful.",1078790400,6,2653,4.75492341356674
1025242,3,6305438137,"I saw this movie when it first came out in the theaters. I have to say I almost walked out of it. The first 45 to 60 minutes I found very boring and hard to follow. BUT then the action-at least a little-started.
In my opinion it doesn't come close to ""Saving Private Ryan"" but it was good. Once I realized it was showing how the war affected several of the soldiers it made a little more sense. BUT it might have been better if it showed how the soldiers were years later also. John Travolta, appearing as an Army brigadier general on board a ship approaching Guadalcanal, was strange. Once the troops left the ship he was never seen or heard from again. Where did he go?
I found Nick Nolte's character a little like George C. Scott in ""Patton."" Both officers didn't appear to care what it cost to take a hill or bunker. Don't get me wrong because I do understand that sacrifices have to be made during wartime. BUT when someone says there is a better way to do something, with less loss of life, why aren't they listened to? Nick almost reminded me of John Wayne in some of his war films. It wasn't until almost the end of the movie before Nick showed what he was feeling.
Woody Harrelson had a short part. He portrayed a sergeant who was handling a grenade that went off. His death scene was a bit unbelievable.
Sean Penn portrayed a caring first sergeant. One who was tough when he needed to be and somewhat compassionate at other times. I had to laugh when George Clooney's character said he was the father of the company, Sean-the mother, and the soldiers the children. I kept expecting to see George throughout the movie but he didn't appear till almost the end.
That was it for the big names of Hollywood. The rest of the cast were unknown to me and will probably remain so. This film just did not grab me at all-although there was one scene that may have and another that actually did.
The scene that may have was when the soldiers finally attacked a village that had been taken over by the Japanese soldiers. This scene almost reminded me of the MyLai incident in Vietnam. Although there was no killing of women and children, there was of the enemy. It showed how in the heat of battle anyone could do something that isn't right. BUT this scene also showed that the Japanese soldiers were experiencing the same things that the Americans were. That being fear, shakes, filth, lack of food and water, etc.
The scene that got me the most had nothing to do with the action, or lack of, in the film. Rather it was when one soldier received a ""Dear John"" letter from his wife asking for a divorce. Throughout the film he had flashbacks of her, their home, and what I thought was their relationship. BUT as he was reading the letter from her, it almost seemed that the scenes of her might have been showing her with another man. I'm not sure. My heart went out to this soldier however as he appeared to really love her and that was helping to keep him alive.
The scenery throughout the film was wonderful: the ocean, the island, the lush tall grass, the bamboo stalks, the mountain stream, etc. Amazingly even after there was a lot of artillery fire on an area there was no sign of damage when the soldiers went into the area. That created a false feeling for me.
Can you tell I didn't really like this film? It was no where near what I felt for Saving Private Ryan, which was an excellent film. I'll be interested to see how others view this film.",1075334400,3,3450,4.3753894080996885

To that effect, Nick Nolte provides the most interesting thing in this movie.  I don't consider myself to have too short of an attention span but I definitely found my attention wondering way too many times during this movie; not a good sign.  I like a fresh approach to a genre such as Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"".

I'm not being naive, although I comprehend the misjudgment of thsi film to be a ""force-fed"" war film such as Saving Private Ryan or Patton (I like both...).  However, Malick is ultimately a Transcendentalist who in a sense is unwelcomed by conventionalist attitudes contributed by the growing wakes of post-modernist theory. This film allows World War II to exist as a backdrop to convey intuition provoked by questions of morality, innhabitions, individualism, and systematic existence within nature (A different approach than the Steinbeck-influenced Days of Heaven).

Me, I'm still trying to understand the attraction.  I've never been in a war, but I've zipped young bodies who met violent ends into bags and just from that I can figure out that war is not a video game.  (Sure looks like one nowadays, watching our aircraft target the little bodies running around down there--but let me say that again: War is not a video game.)
""Thin Red Line"" is not as much a ""kill the bad guys, defend our brothers!"" kind of movie like ""Saving Private Ryan"" (far more popular) was, which I find interesting, since both deal with the same war--perhaps the last war that really *could be* discussed in simple terms of good vs. evil instead of politics and finance.  This one, from the first voice-over, is an exploration that leaves you to draw your own conclusions.
You ought to do that.  However, here's my prediction: if you only like movies where the good guys overcome adversity to kick the bad guy's ass, skip ""Thin Red Line.""

But  reading some of the other  reviews,  I retained two comments I realy liked so will bring forward.
This Malick is apparently an arthouse(s-house) director, well, as somebody said, this was an arthouse director turned-loose with a big-house budget, so you get a 50-million dollar serving of pretentious boredom instead of half a million dollars worth . I respected arthouse directors more before this film, because up till this, they hadnt gotten me into their showroom. This ripped me off for whatever the ticket cost me as well, it won't be forgotten. At least I went alone, I didn't recommend and entice anyone else along to be ripped-off.
And the next review I saw that contained something far more profound than 'Line itself was actually a glowing review,5-stars,  where among other things the reviewer compared it to 'Empires of the Sun', among one or two others.
Baby, aint that the truth, thats the ideal companion  to it. Unfortunately, with THAT, I didn't see it alone, I was responsible for wasting a friends money and evening as well as my own.

1025305,5,6305438137,"I have read many reviews of this film over the years and I still don't understand why it isn't more appreciated.  I have watched ""Badlands"" and ""Days of Heaven"" which are both excellent but I honestly prefer ""The Thin Red Line"".
First of all, the acting is awesome in this movie.  Jim Caviezel, Sean Penn and Nick Nolte are all very soulful.  I have read stories of how Sean Penn basically begged Mallick for the opportunity to be in this movie and it really shows in his effort.  Even John Cusack (I love him in everything) and Woody Harrelson do very well in their smaller parts.
But the true power of this movie is in the questions that it asks.  I love the mysticism that fills the whole film.  I once read a review that said, ""Mallick takes us on his search for God but we didn't want to go with him"".  Well, I think the person who wrote that must be a superficial, materialistic fool who probably shouldn't be reviewing movies for a career.  I guess he would prefer ""Bad Boys 2"" or something.
The fact is that this movie is very spiritual and beautiful even as it faces the reality of suffering and evil.  The cinematography, music and acting are awesome.  The movie challenges the audience to consider the thoughts and questions of the soldiers.  The answers aren't given.  You must answer them yourself.  What a beautiful film.",1073520000,7,1335,4.5125
1025306,2,6305438137,"I will try to be more brief than alot of the other reviews.
First, let me say that the cinematography was excellent in this film. Many truly breathtaking shots all around. The combat scenes were generally well done and believable for the most part. The acting was pretty good on most counts and for my money the most memorable performance from the film was that of Nick Nolte as a commander without the true ability to be a leader.
Where I feel that the movie falls apart are at many different turns. First of all, the whole flashback/love story thing with one of the many characters in the film that we really don't get to know or come to like or dislike are done in a way that they telegraph what is going to happen later on. What I mean is that from the second or third one of the scenes that I saw with this particular soldier flashing back to his wife/girlfriend it was already clear that it was leading up to her betrayal of him while he was away at war. Poorly done. Second, as mentioned above, there are many characters in this film, but for the most part we never get to know any of them or get to care about what happens to them. They are by and large just a group of nobodies that we are watching because we really don't get any sort of introduction. A perfect example is how near the end of the film we all of a sudden see John Cusack appear on screen seemingly from nowhere and lead a heroic charge to take over an enemy position. I had no clue he was even in this movie until that point, and while in some circumstances that would make sense, in this one it does not because this film is focused on a small group of soldiers. Throw these characters that are utterly forgettable in with the way that the story jumps around between combat scenes, flashback scenes, and everything else, and I found myself thoroughly disappointed.
This film seemed as though it was aiming to make a good point but somehow missed the mark. Although it is not supposed to be a typical war movie it still has a good amount of combat footage in it. Really it doesn't appeal to the fans of the action war movie because too much of the film is spent jumping around to things not related. It doesn't appeal to those that like a character driven story like you get in Band of Brothers because there is nobody in this film that you get to know or that you even care about. My recommendation is that if you want a more thought provoking movie that deals with the insanity and horrors of war, watch Apocalypse Now.",1073520000,7,2497,4.2923728813559325
1025307,1,6305438137,"At least, this movie falls flat on its face, and if you've ever wondered what it feels like, then just watch and see.
So many people say that this movie is deep and insightful, that it is trying to analyze the dichotomies of nature and war, and how they fit together and yet, at the same time, contrast one another. The only problem is that this movie is even more 'shallow' than any action-oriented war movie simply because the 'depth' within this movie is a complete joke, nothing more than a rehash of pop psychology. I mean you may as well sit on the grass and say aloud ""ponder the many facets of a droplet of water, see how the light reflects from it... wow. Then again what do you expect when a movie begins with ""What's this war in the heart of nature, why does nature vie with itself, the land contend with the sea"", and later continue with a superior officer telling one of his men that he won't make any difference and that if he dies there he will die for nothing.
And then the way that the military is commanded and controlled... Well, I've never known anyone who served who was even half as unprofessional as any of the 'soldiers' that you see portrayed in this. Talk about dereliction of duty and an embarrassment to the uniform. You would have thought they were all pulled from the local daycare and shoved into a uniform. Truly sad. I mean, if someone has a history of going AWOL he should just be shot, not someone who is treated like a hero by the filmmakers. After all, in their eyes, he was the one that was trying to avoid the war...
In short, if the USA was in a war, and the enemy wanted to rally their troops, they could just play for them this movie, and say, ""Look at what the Americans think of their own military"". This film is an embarrassment to us all. And in saying this I am not saying that it needs more action or anything, I don't mind the lack of combat. I wasn't expecting an action movie. I wasn't expecting a bunch of leftist anti-war propaganda either, however.",1072396800,18,2002,4.327127659574468
1025308,3,6305438137,"I saw this movie at the theaters when it was first released in 1999, and have watched it several more times on DVD, and own a DVD version of my own. I'm writing only to bring some balance to the polarized reviews I've read on this website. People who compare ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Thin Red Line"" and conclude by praising one and panning the other (it doesn't even matter which) are clearly missing the point of BOTH movies. Malick's film is almost an allegory...a visual and sensual evocation of both primitive and profound human feelings. I doubt that it was ever Malick's purpose to deal with war per se, other than as a medium to expose the inner heart of man. When I have enjoyed watching ""Thin Red Line"" the most, I have watched with that expectation. If you're in the mood for bare-bones war, however, this film won't satisfy. ""Saving Private Ryan"", while certainly also portraying the human emotions involved with war (most brilliantly and realistically, fear), was more concerned with gritty realism. The cinematography contrasts between the two movies alone ought to tell the viewer what he is in for. Malick's film is almost surrealistic in its imagery- ""Private Ryan"" has the gritty realism of a documentary. Both methods have an undeniable effect.
For my money, however, ""Private Ryan"" is what most people look for in a war film. ""Thin Red Line"" certainly conveys the inner personal anguish, doubt, fear, and even savagery of its combatants, but it doesn't show the real, external face of war.
But please, folks, don't delude the readers with the idea that one of these two films is ""better"" than the other. They both have their respectful place in moviemaking about war.",1071273600,114,1688,4.824137931034483

1025313,1,6305438137,"What a mess! This film was the directorial reemergence of hermit-like director Terrence Malick after a twenty-year absence. A darling of film buffs, Malick had dropped out of sight after 1978's DAYS OF HEAVEN. The critical community awaited THIN RED LINE with childlike eagerness, ready to gush over any pearls that Malick was willing to cast before the viewing public. It was this hero worship that motivated most of the reviews that praised THIN RED LINE as a work of beauty and introspective genius. These reviews were exercise in not pointing out the emperor had no clothes. While film critics described LINE as a ""tone poem"" or a ""philosophical exploration into the nature of man"" few described it as a good (or even comprehensible) movie.
This is not to say LINE is very deep. Most of Malick's observations (war is bad, men are brothers, Cain slew Able) have been made before and better in other films. THIN RED LINE is a self absorbed exercise in failed editing, the vanity piece of a small budget director allowed to go mad with a major studio's money.
What appears on screen is a jumbled mix of footage from a National Geographic nature special and a preachy and poorly directed anti-war screed. Lush nature scenes are followed by incoherent bits of method acting and disconnected plot. Malick had some of the finest young actors of the period to work with, but won't let them act. Few have much time on screen, and much of their dialogue is drowned out by intrusive voice-over telling us what the actors are thinking. He fails to remember that the point of drama is to have the actors ACT and allow us to figure out what they are thinking. There is no character development and no discernable plot thread. Added to this is the bizarre casting of a pudgy and longhaired John Travolta as a General (!?) and an over-the-top Nick Nolte as a deranged and glory hungry Colonel to make a confused stew that only the pretentious or hopelessly Malick smitten could love.
The only watchable segment is a combat scene where John Cusack (playing an Army Captain) leads an assault on a Japanese bunker complex, a sequence that stands up to any in film history. Seeing the quality of that scene actually makes one a little sad, to think of the film that Malick could have made with more focus and self-control. If he could do such a fine job there, what a shame that he wasted so much talent (his and the actors) and time (his and the film viewing public) on what is essentially a college film project made with a 50 million dollar budget.

1025389,5,6305438137,"Based on Terrence Malick's past track record what were people expecting? Saving Private Ryan 2? No way. Malick has always followed his own muse and does so with the skill of a master filmmaker with his ""adaptation"" of The Thin Red Line.

Malick uses the book as a starting point, a springboard for which to launch his own thematically pre-occupations -- mostly to do with man's struggle with his environment. TRL shows that even while we are killing each other off, nature will still survive and continue on regardless if we are still around to see it. Malick also explores the duality of man -- the killing instinct vs. the introspective philosopher.

I think that what really angered people was that the advertising campaign promoted all these big Hollywood stars: John Travolta, George Clooney, Woody Harrelson, etc. and then Malick relegated them to cameos. Instead, you have then unknowns like James Caviezel and Nick Stahl in major roles with reliable veterans like Nick Nolte and Sean Penn backing them up. Also, if you blink you might miss Adrien Brody's tiny role. Supposedly, he was originaly touted as one of the leads but Malick cut his role back significantly in the editing room.

Above all else, this is an absolutely stunning film to look at. The cinematography is gorgeous and really creates an atmospheric world that is rich and textured. The DVD's top notch transfer and stunning DTS audio track also contribute greatly to enveloping the viewer into Malick's world.

If you like challenging war films then this is definitely worth a look. If you don't like to think when watching a movie then avoid this one like the plague.

It's a bird's-eye-view of the nature of man's capability for destruction, both of other men and of his surroundings.  It delves into man's unwillingness to take responsibility for the effects of his actions on his surroundings, and how sometimes, when one man does try to do right by his fellow men, he can be persecuted for it.  While this sounds pretty melancholy, this is only the subtext of the movie.  The overwhelming message that this movie delivers, is that there may be a way out of this mess man has created, but that no one man can do it alone.  The one thing that struck me is that it wasn't just a sterile historical portrayal of Guadalcanal, nor was it just about war, guns, valor, and blood, which is okay in its own right, but has been done many times over.  An excellent example would be Saving Private Ryan, which I also own.  This movie was different.  It didn't show war in a vacuum, but rather included war, valor, intensity, nature, spirituality, love, hate, blood, guts, brotherhood, and, if I may say so, excellent battle scenes all in one gritty and moving performance.

But the movie doesn't cop to the emptiness it so doggedly portays. Because the charactors respond in this context so believablely and honest, some truly vivid scenes are possible.

If you're looking for a good action flick, or prefer movies that drive their point home, this one isn't for you.
On the other hand, if you've ever been wrapped up in a particular work of art and tried to deduce what the artist is trying to say, you're going to love this picture movie.

1025471,3,6305438137,"Though it was purely coincidence that this film came out at roughly the same time as Private Ryan a lot of people seem to compare the two as recent examples of great war movies.
Both films in my opinion fall short of the 'great war film' tag for completely different reasons. While Ryan simplifies the most important event of modern history to an almost arcade game, cowboy action movie this one goes the down the complete opposite path and tries to draw the viewer into the psychological realm of the soldier.
While the characters are well defined due to some brilliant performances (Nick Nolte and John Cusack's were oscar worthy) their thought process is conveyed by a voice over which doesn't seem to distinguish one from the other, they all fall under a sort of poet/philosopher umbrella. This pondering is very much the voice of the director who seems to be exploring his inner world rather than the inner world of the individual soldiers. The other shortfall of this film is the script which starts off solidly and takes the viewer into a captivating battle for a hill, definitely the high point of the film. It then meanders into a series of meaningless battles that do nothing for the plot or substance of the film. The script could have been trimmed down a bit more Mr Malick. BTW you made a much better film than Spielberg but it could have been great had you sacrificed a little arty self indulgence for a slightly more objective representation of the reality of Pacific warfare.",1054857600,2,1491,4.694656488549619
1025472,4,6305438137,"The Thin Red Line is a very good war movie set during the battle of Guadalcanal in the Pacific theater.  This is not just a shoot 'em up movie about blood and gore, although there are excellent battle scenes in this movie.  The movie follows the path of a platoon's involvement in the battle through the eyes of its soldiers.  Look carefully because some soldiers do not make much of an impression.  This movie does not just show the fighting in war, but also the beliefs and fears of the soldiers.  For this reason, many people did not like this movie, but it is still very good.
 There is a very large cast in this movie with some big names.  The people giving better performances are Sean Penn, Jim Caviezel, Nick Nolte, and Ben Chaplin.  Some of the more interesting dialogue comes between Penn and Caviezel as they discuss the point of the war.  Also starring are John Cusack, Adrien Brody, Elias Koteas, George Clooney in a very small and pointless role, and Woody Harrelson.  The thing that makes this movie good is the exceptional performances by the cast.  Also, Hans Zimmer turns in another excellent musical score that includes the native of Guadalcanal.

From an action standpoint, I can see how some people consider this movie to be slow and overly philosophic, but it's really not a movie about the Battle for Guadalcanal.  It's about men at war, and what war can do to a man.  It could be set in the midst of any conflict anywhere in history.  Chaos, terror, boredom, selfish ambitions and selfless acts--all of these things are a part of armed conflict, and Malick explores them without rendering judgment.
The idea that everyone who goes to war is a hero is abandoned here.  In war, men don't all die heroic deaths, many die painful, lonely deaths, some die ridiculous deaths, and ultimately, all die futile deaths.  This point Sean Penn's character drives home.  Men do things to one another that they later revile themselves for.  Is courage simply a manifestation of fear?
The cinematography in this movie was magnificent.  The beautiful scenery and weather contrasted greatly with the terror that was taking place on the island of Guadalcanal.  Really a beautifully directed film.
Ultimately, given the horrors that the characters are put through and the choices that they make, the final lesson to be taken is that the war goes on.",1050537600,2,1377,4.846153846153846

The things that men struggle with during times of war. It is not just patriotism and rah, rah U.S.A. It is about the struggle of war and the struggle of men during the time of war. Maybe this is a movie we should all watch again with our country's present situation. I found The Thin Red Line to be a very powerful and moving picture.

1025542,4,6305438137,"The Thin Red Line was released in 1998 and drew immediate comparisons to another World War II film released that year, Saving Private Ryan.  The former film is very much like to yin to the latters yang.  Where as Ryan depicts the battle D-Day and its subsequent aftermath in the European war theater, Red Line deals with the Battle of Guadalacanal in the Pacific.  Ryan shows the graphic and detailed horrors of war, where as Red Line deals with psychological effects on a soldiers mind.  The film marks the return of Terrence Malick.  The film was his first in twenty years and only the third of his career.  Much like his two previous efforts, Days Of Heaven & Badlands, the film has a sweeping vision.  The film is based on James Jones semi-autobiographical novel that was the follow-up to From Here To Eternity.  The cast is star studded, including appearances by George Clooney, John Travolta, Woody Harrelson, John Cusack, Bill Pullman, John Savage, John C. Reilly, Nick Nolte and Sean Penn, but it is the lesser known actors in the cast that are the foundation of the film.  James Caviezel stars as Pvt. Witt who is a deserter living on a South Pacific island but is captured by the Navy and sent back into war.  Adrien Brody (who has garnered an Oscar nomination in 2003 for The Pianist) is Pvt. Fife, who was the central character and Mr. Jones alter-ego in the book, but has been relegated to a supporting part, Ben Chaplin is Pvt. Bell who is suffering from the ignominy of a Dear John letter from his wife, Elias Koteas as a righteous captain and Tim Blake Nelson (from O Brother, Where Art Thou?) as Pvt. Tills.  Mr. Malick captures the lush beauty of the South Pacific and uses it to perfectly contrast with the destruction of war.  The film uses Mr. Caviezels character in voice-overs in which he expouses on life & death that provide the heart of what this film is all about.  It tries to show that while the men who fought in World War II have been portrayed as fearless men who fought for freedom without question, they were real people, with fears and doubts.  The film received seven Academy Award nomination including two for Mr. Malick in the directing and adapted screenplay categories as well as best picture, but it came home empty-handed.",1046995200,,2264,4.6275
1025543,5,6305438137,"This film is absolutely amazing, but to much disappointment was overshadowed by the success of Saving Private Ryan. 'Ryan' is more of an action war flick, whereas if you watch Thin Red Line, and I mean actually try to take it all in you can truly see the beauty of the film.
The characters are each learning to deal with the horrors of war that is all around them. Some choose to fight with valor and display their patriotism while others question their role in the war. The characters express through inner monologue their thoughts on the war and how to deal with death. It seems evident that they expect the war to take their life, and they are finding a way to go down content with their life.
This film has an amazing cast, and if you take your eye away for a second you could miss a Hollywood stars performance. But the two that steal the show are Sean Penn (Sgt. Welsh) and Jim Cavaziel (Pvt. Witt). Welsh expresses his questions on the war, saying that this is reality. This is the truth of the world. Witt gives a completely different take; he is able to find another world, a peaceful society with the Guadalcanal islanders. He knows there is a better place out there away from the war and he has experienced it. Witt is the hero of the story as he is able to learn how to live while staring death in the eye.
This movie is absolutely amazing. Do not just watch it to see another war flick; it is so much more than that. Watch this movie and see if you can take it all in because there is so much to love about it.

It is a hauntingly realistic view of a US Army Infantry Battalion and its men fighting the bloody battle for Guadal Canal.  This film is wrought with an almost spiritual sense of moral chaos as these men face the brutalities of war without and within themselves.
Despite its all star lineup to include; Nick Nolte, Woody Harrelson, Sean Penn, Jim Caviezel, John Cusack and brief appearances by George Clooney and John Travolta, the films overall atmosphere is melodramatic and at times, tedious.  One point of note would be that given what appears to have been a large enough budget, none of the American soldiers wore any rank whatsoever.  I found this oversight, slightly distracting considering that the filmmakers were apparently trying to make as realistic a film as possible.
The premise:  MINOR SPOILER
World War II in the Pacific and Nick Nolte's character is a Colonel in charge of a US Army Infantry Battalion charged with the task to take Guadal Canal from the Japanese in order to secure an airfield.  The film opens up with some beautiful scenery and a couple soldiers who are, by all appearances, living with some Pacific Islanders.  A naval vessel approaches the island and we then meet Sean Penn's character who is the company First Sergeant, sent to retrieve these two AWOL (Absent without leave) soldiers.  We're then taken to where the rest of the company is, preparing for a beach assault and the rest of the film.
Overall, I found this film worth watching, yet not quite up to the expectations I had with reference to the 7 Academy Award Nominations & Including Best Picture boldly labeled on the DVD Jacket.
Special features:  Several Melanesian Songs which are quite beautiful in and of themselves, but that is about it with the Special features.  {ssintrepid}",1043280000,7,1886,4.8473520249221185

But did anyone understand it? I don't care how ""philosophical"" it was, or how pretty the flowers on the island looked in contrast to the brutality of war. I know it was an anti-war statement (at least I imagine it was).  But any ""issue"" movie still needs to have a coherent plot. It was virtually impossible to follow the strategy of the soldiers or frankly to care what was going on or to care about the characters.  Most of the major actors in the movie had very few scenes (as though they wanted to pad their resumes with this film).  In SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, for example, we saw the utter brutality of war, but we always knew what the soldiers were doing, where they  were in relationship to each other, and we had a stake in their actions.  In THIN RED LINE, we flat out have no idea what their military goal is, how they are working to achieve it and how it's going.

 In fact this movie has so much more to do with the struggle of the madness and pain in one person's mind then with war itself. It is about the need for spirituality, even in times of horror and pain. It is about finding a spiritual connectedness with all things and about what it means to be part of not just a human family, but a family of the world. Obviously, many have missed the point. But I must say that no movie that I have seen to date has ever affected me as much as ""A Thin Red Line"". It is a mesmerizing spiritual journey and look at the horrors of war and life.

While attempting to be serious it does neither the Americans or Japanese any justice in historical fact or realism. The opening should have been cut out. The whole time I was watching this I was thinking, so when is this going to get started? An insult to injury was George Clooney was advertised on the box like a main charachter, but only had two lines and five minutes of camera time at the end of the film.
Another annoying thing, is that in the middle of the few (and bogus) battle scenes, one of the main charachters continues to drift into sexual fantasies about his wife which are really, strange given the context.
The film tries to portray war in an artsy-fartsy way that makes this war look like a boring outing of paintball with a bunch of
mentaly hospital escapees. The worst part, however, was that it was THREE HOURS LONG! ""Private Ryan"" was three hours long too, but that was a good movie, with changing scenerey and story.
This movie was such a miserable waste of yen (or dollars) that if I had paid much more for it I would have taken it back!
The acting was really poor, there was an insane officer who was supposed to be disturbing, a picture of the effects of war, unfortunatly it served as comic relief, as he wandered about shouting. A soldier is shot in the stomach so he stands there screaming, falls down, still screaming, and a medic is sent out. He is shot (well, it looks like he just falls asleep, more bad acting) but nobody semes to notice, even though they're all watching.

A. Make us cry
B. Make us want to pick up a rifle and join the army
C. Make us shout, ""hoora"" as we watch yet another glorious blood and guts scene featuring the noble aspect of honor, duty, and sacrifice.
What will we ever do?!?
I know, maybe we should try thinking for the first time in our lives when we watch a film. How 'bout that?
This film doesn't focus on the glamor or the spoils of war. It strays from the glorious charge, the valiant assault on the hill leading to a splendid celebration in the ranks, the bronze medals or silver stars. No, it doesn't do those things at all. Instead, we get to see a very diverse group of characters, from a dreamy private who sees the good in all to a cold hearted Colonel who wants nothing more than to earn another rank. We see the vast diversity of all the many types of men who embody a soldier.
When there are death scenes we do not cry. We feel a total lack of emotion and feeling. In that way, Malick does a wonderful trick, bulldozing all the war movie cliches that have become common practice in mainstream Hollywood. We feel the total lack of feeling that many veterans today feel.
At one point, a character states: ""War don't enoble men, it turns 'em into dogs.""  The idea here is that war, in and of itself, is like choosing poison. To kill for the sake of good is still the shedding of blood. This idea if further demonstrated when Caviezal's character stares at a dead Japanese soldier, imagining what the soldier might be saying. The dead soldier states: ""Are you loved by all? Know that I was too. Do you imagine your sufferings will be less because you loved truth, justice?""
And again, while the soldiers are invading a Japanese camp, we here yet another thought from Caviezal's dreamy character stating: ""This great evil, where's it come from. From what root, what seed was it planted? Who's doing this to us? Who's killing us? Do you walk in this night too?""
Skeptics will quickly brush off such poetry as mere rhetoric. I beg to differ. Such ideas are solid measuring points on humanity, the idea of evil, and the idea of war. After all,  where do morals derive from? One man's good is another man's evil and the common evil in this film appears to be war itself.
This film is not for everyone but it does convey some powerful statements throughout the 3+ hours of viewing time. Take note: if you enjoy thinking films, this will suffice. There are no clear cut ideas here, but more of a search as you go feeling. By the time you've seen it(twice might be necessary), your ideas of war, morality, and the classic concepts of duty, nobility, and honor might not be the same anymore.
I give this film an A+ for actually taking a stand and sticking with it, even though Saving Private Ryan lovers, classic skeptics, and ""color it for me"" movie lovers blast it left and right.",1039910400,10,2875,4.402255639097745

You see the pain they face either sending men to their deaths, being away from the women they love, or just being trapped in such a beautiful place for all the wrong reasons.
The movie is acted out well, filmed in such a breathtaking style, and touches on such universal issues and truths that it still amazes me that people didn't like it.  Its not conventional or all that easy at times, but it is touching and amazing.  All of this touchy feely stuff is set to the backdrop of amazing, suspensful battle scenes that make your stomach drop... not for their violence or graphic nature but because you don't know what will happen next.  You're placed there with these men.  A must have and one of the best movies of the past few years!",1038355200,,1165,4.488151658767772
1025627,4,6305438137,"This is a beautiful and strangely moving film. In my opinion it beat the bejeezus out of Saving Private R. Why? Well, yes the set pieces in Saving Private Ryan are astonishing, but its center is told very conventionally and blandly. It shocked me to watch the battles, but it didn't stay with me.
The Thin Red Line however is utterly haunting and lyrical, and rather disturbing. But it's not a conventional war movie and shouldn't be reviewed in those terms. Go elsewhere for typical blood and guts (although there certainly are some to be had). If you want something with a broader viewpoint, a more penetrating world view - check this out.

1025629,1,6305438137,"This is not movie in the normal sense of the word. It is instead a montage of loosely related vignettes vaguely based on the latter part of the Guadalcanal campaign. At least a third of it should have been left on the cutting room floor and the fact that three different editors couldn't knit the various pieces into a cohesive story is not surprising.
The movie begins with a series of National Geographic scenes that portray the idyllic, peaceful, carefree and loving lifestyle of the Micronesion aborigines living on the island.  This series of scenes is repeated ad nauseaum.  Go to the bathroom, cook some microwave popcorn and when you return the director is still hammering home whatever cryptic point he hopes to make. This portends the crude and heavy-handed approach to story telling seen in the rest of the film.
This is a Big Message movie.  However, it remains to the end entirely unclear what that message is or what those messages are. Do we care about or identify with any character?  No.  Does one scene logically lead to another?  No. Do all of the internal monologues and flashbacks tell us anything important?  Beats me.  The plot, if there is one, can be best described as ""stuff happens"".
We are treated to the longest reaction shots in the history of modern cinema.  It is not enough to cut to the face of frightened soldier in battle.  No.  We must interminably dwell upon it until our fingers begin to twitch on the fast forward button.  Time to take a leak or forage in the refrigerator.  You will still have the reaction shot on screen when you return to watch the rest of this wretched movie.
On the bright side, boring and pretentious though it may be, Thin Red Line is beautifully photographed.  Still images from it would have made a great coffee table book or slide show. Nevertheless, it is, perhaps, the worst big budget, big talent movie I have ever seen.
A last footnote:  over 1,000 Japanese prisoners were taken during the Guadalcanal campaign.  Japanese propoganda and indoctrination would see to it that this would never happen again.  Attrition to the last man was all they had left to encourage a negotiated settlement. This is one of the few things the movie got historically right.",1037059200,14,2225,4.72279792746114
1025690,5,6305438137,"I think the most important thing to understand-- and the most important opinion I can offer about this film-- is that THIS IS NOT A WAR MOVIE!
Yes, The Thin Red Line has some blood, guts and portrayals of the horrors of war, but that's really secondary to the core of the film. If you're looking for a ""Great War Movie,"" DON'T buy this one. It will bore you to tears-- as others here have gone to some trouble to point out-- there is no ""plot"" centered around a battle, heroic soldiers or ""The Glory of War."" IF that's what you're looking for, I would recommend ""Platoon"" or ""Full Metal Jacket"" instead, or maybe ""Saving Private Ryan,"" to which this movie is often-- but mistakenly-- compared.
""The Thin Red Line"" is reclusive director Terrence Malick's exquisite visual masterpiece loosely set around the Guadalcanal campaign during World War II in the Pacific Arena. I say ""loosely"" because that statement is a bit like calling Forrest Gump ""some flick about a retarded guy."" It is perhaps unfortunate that Malick did not adhere to historic accuracy-- but also forgiveable since the ""war"" theme is merely a backdrop, and historical accuracy is relatively irrelevant to the message of the film.
The Thin Red Line is basically a profoundly philosophical morality play on life, death and the love that drives us through moments of sheer terror, and it is also a piece of deeply moving poetry that captures the beauty of life and the tragic sadness of our world. Students and afficionados of filmmaking will be treated to stunning visuals and technical mastery-- Malick's perfectionism is surpassed by few; others will be treated to almost three hours of ""eye candy."" Almost every shot is a work of art, and I cannot even begin to imagine how many feet of film must have ended on the cutting room floor before the final cut came together.
The imagery switches back and forth between the tranquility and beauty of nature and the roughness and brutality of war, interspersed with ""poetic vignettes;"" philosophical reflections to ""another time, another place."" The frequent use of narrative voiceovers provide a sometimes startling, sometimes disturbing, counterpoint to the images on the screen.
Although the DVD box reads like the film has a ""cast of thousands,"" several of the ""names"" (John Travolta, George Clooney, Woody Harrelson) have little more than cameo appearances. Jim Caviezel, Sean Penn, John Cusack and Nick Nolte put in solid-- albeit not inspired-- performances. Overall, the film is more about abstract concepts than about the characters and the action, themselves.
The Thin Red Line is definitely on my ""all-time top 20"" list of films, BUT-- and this is a BIG ""but""-- it only ""works"" if you maintain the perspective that you're watching an ""art"" film, rather than an ""action"" film.",1036800000,5,2796,4.951063829787234
1025691,2,6305438137,"A prolonged war picture about the battle for Guadalcanal Island, ""The Thin Red Line"" hits and misses. Terrence Malick's direction is correlative to nobody else. Characters come and go. Sean Penn thinks he knows a lot about life and death (substantial). Jim Caviezel is one with nature (habitat boy). Nick Nolte is an irate sergeant with really needs to calm down (his veins are full of merit). Woody Harrelson loses his hind end (twinge!). Elias Koteas doesn't like the sergeant (not good). George Clooney, John Travolta and John Cusack make appearances (why?). There are plenty of shots to make any cinematographer jealous. Good acting, but three hours of almost nothing will leave you empty.  If you are willing to see how long you can last before you fall asleep, try it out. If you feel like meditating, watch this.

1025692,5,6305438137,"This film haunts me. The images, the music, the narration ... they draw me back to the film again and again. I react differently each time I watch it. Like a true work of art, it defies easy characterization. I was so struck by it, that I made my wife watch it with me again on our honeymoon!
Many complain about a lack of a strong narrative and character development. These complaints have some merit. They accurately describe the film; but they do not have merit as complaints. You don't have to tell a story to have an impact as a film, and the lack of character development can be attributed to the ""everyman"" perspective of much of the film.
There is a fascinating interplay between man and nature in the film, and I pick up different details each time I watch. Sometimes, nature -- the landscape -- seems to revolt at the violence and it antagonizes the perpetrators. At other times, nature reveals its own violent side. There is an unforgettable scene where Caviezel's character discovers that the apparently peaceful native inhabitants of the island -- those who are closest to nature -- have a history of bloodshed themselves. There are other scenes that fascinate me and have etched themselves in my mind.
Caviezel is perfect in what I think of as a Christ-like character in the film. One gaze from his eyes can convey so much. It's the best role I have seen him in.
Sometimes slow and ponderous. Sometimes moving. Sometimes hard to decipher. A fantastic, beautiful, compelling, and thoughtful film.

Unfortunately, that's about all Terrence Malick's film has going for it, as the script is shallow, and a cohesive storyline is non-existent.  The characters are so poorly drawn out that by the end you don't even care whether the heroes live or die (John Cusack's excellent performance and character being the sole exception); you just want this movie to end.  The film's cover boasts an impressive list of actors; unfortunately, most of the famous actors appear for an entire 30-60 seconds each.  No joke.  This would be all right if the script would allow talented actors like Jim Caviezel to breath life into this shell of a film, but it sadly doesn't.  I could go on about Hans Zimmer's wonderfully unused music, about the film's lack of a serious objective or point, or maybe about my astonishment regarding the fact that George Clooney received cover recognition for a 15 second speech, but I won't.  Instead I will merely say this: at a full 3 hours, this film is about 3 hours too long, given that its driving force (which fails utterly) is collage of South Pacific scenery over a Jim Caviezel with a Southern accent's pointless, endless, and redundant, almost Shakespearean, monologues.  As my father, a man who sat through two showings of 'Ben-Hur' back to back in the same afternoon, stated as he stood up to leave: ""Boring.""",1035849600,10,1497,4.862204724409449

After the constant drooling by so many actors and film buffs of the return of Terrence Malick to directing, you'd think he'd pull a much more coherent, approachable movie out of his butt to make his debut. He's obviously way too self important for that.

1025696,5,6305438137,"The Thin Red Line is one of the most misunderstood movies I've seen in my life.  Only a few people truly see the meaning of this movie, I included in this group.  What many people saw in this movie was a boring war movie, and with Saving Private Ryan out the same year, that is understandable.  The thing is though, is it was Private Ryan that really wasn't the war movie of the two.
  Now that is not to say Private Ryan wasn't a good war movie, it was.  But The Thin Red Line in a nutshell is the best war epic ever produced.  This movie gives you a real look on war.  It doesn't sugar coat it with a subplot like Private Ryan where you go in depth in soldier's lives.  In The Thin Red Line you see men of different backgrounds all given a suicidal order by a stubborn colnel to charge a hill, and see how they react to it.
  The thing that really makes this film unforgetable to me is the beautiful words spoken by various soliders with the view of war, or the view of the Guadal Canal.  Whether it be sunlight through trees, a parrot, or actual war footage, it was something that will remain in me forever.
  The other reason I love this movie is Jim Caviezel, bar none.  Caviezel plays private Witt, who is the solider focused on most.  Caviezel was a relative no name before this movie, and I believe he truly deserved an Oscar for his role.  He was a calm man in an insane world.  He saw peace and harmony in everything, and Caviezel did an unbelievable job portraying this man.  Because of this great performance he has gone on to make great films such as ""Frequency"" and ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" along with a hanful of others.  2001 and 2002 have been very busy years for him and I believe that will continue to be the trend.  Expect Caviezel to be a first tier actor in 5 years.  And when you see him reach that level, remmber this was the movie that started it all for him.
  One last note, don't forget to pick up the soundtrack, done by the great Hans Zimmer.  Its very un zimmeresque and i believe it to be his best.  This movie was defintely a 10/10 and should have won the best picture without a doubt.",1032998400,,2121,4.188118811881188

This is a very mis-leading comparison though.  Comparing The Thin Red Line to Saving Private Ryan is like comparing Cast Away to Robinson Crusoe: it's apples and oranges.  The Thin Red Line is a movie about life and its meaning which is set in a war (a situation very conducive to this kind of reflection), while Saving Private Ryan is a straight movie about war; Cast Away is a movie about remaining static while the rest of the world changes (again, being stranded on an island is a situation that is conducive to this kind of story), while Robinson Crusoe is a straight movie about survival.

Malick has a great gift for revealing the natural world on film (first evident in the breathtaking Days of Heaven of long ago), and he does it in The Thin Red Line.
There is an undertow of profound sadness to this movie, which is sustained by the haunting soundtrack and the wonderful characterizations.

While Private Ryan did a good job at depicting the horrors of war and the honor of the individual soldier, The Thin Red Line gives us the psychological aspects of war, which is a far more complex and intriguing world then the one presented to us by Spielberg. This film is longer and less ""hollywoodized"" than Ryan, but it has just as many gripping battle scenes and a star all-male cast that arguably makes the performances in Private Ryan pale by comparison. And while the latter work gave us the titanic, war-torn towns in France, this one gives us a glimpse into the colorful, exotic world of the Asia-Pacific region. To sum things up, this film is a masterpiece for an audience that appreciates war films that are realistic yet also introspective, delving into the the eternal issue of life and the meaning that human beings give to it.",1028246400,13,1147,4.74

Last, this movie is about 10-20 minutes too long. The flick could, and should have, ended after the combat secured the island. Instead this director decided to take 20 minutes or so to include a couple more pointless ""dream sequences"" about home plus a scene where one character's wife sends him a letter asking for a divorce. While this did happen to many soldiers in both the PTO and ETO, the movie doesn't really spend enough time prior to the combat scenes developing the characters enough to make the audience care. Nick Nolte also does a horrible job of portraying an American officer.

Combat scenes are hallucinatory, both from the standpoint of camerawork and its departures from what happened as described by actual participants in the battle and official history. For instance, the movie depicts the attack as occurring across grasslands. In reality, dense jungle impeded the advance of the American Army's 25th Division every step of the way. Japanese defensive positions were invisible until US troops were within 15 feet. In the end, tanks were needed to end the bloody stalemate. None of this is shown in the movie.

1025815,5,6305438137,"I think that the main issue a lot of people have with this movie is that it is not a rock'em, sock'em, blow'em up flick like Private Ryan was.  Since they came out in theatres around the same time I think that the film gets unfairly compared to Ryan on a real regular basis, whether consciously or not.  It comes down to this: if you're looking for a Pacific-theatre version of that other movie, you're going to be disappointed.  (Go buy Starship Troopers or something.)
I read the book before I saw this movie (on DVD) and really enjoyed it as a novel.  This film treatment takes liberties but is entirely appropriate in tone and absolutely superior in its shooting, angles, and virtually every other technical detail.  Some of the grotesque humor from the book survives and the essential struggle of the characters is faithfully portrayed.  The acting is simply amazing as well.
It's definitely not your typical war movie, though.  It's not even your typical action movie.  It's just completely atypical in its approach to war, an approach which is - for lack of a better term - artistic.",1027296000,2,1090,4.7

If you like extremely dramatic movies that are more interested in showing you mostly nature footage, then you may like this.  It is not a war movie in the sense of ""Full Metal Jacket"", ""Platoon"", or ""Saving Private Ryan"".  Those movies had well written stories, great acting and plenty of appropriate action.  ""Thin Red Line"" has none of that.  For every minute you see of fighting or real concerns of war, you are subjected to ten minutes of National Geographic style nature footage.

1025820,5,6305438137,"First off, this is NOT, let me write it again, NOT like Saving Private Ryan. The biggest injustice for this movie was that some knuckleheads had the audacity to compare it to Saving Private Ryan. While Ryan focuses on the honor and sacrifice of the average soldier in WW2, Red Line does just the opposite, choosing more to focus on the bitterness and pure lack of emotions that many soldiers faced.
In this film, we are introduced to a group of men who are as diverse and differing as one could dream up.  There is a dreamer(play by Jim Caviezel) who chooses to see the good in all, a over-ambitious major(Nick Nolte), a compassionate captain(Elias Koteas), and many others who embody fear, reluctance, cowardess, love, isolation, synicism, and total lack of hope, among other things.
Many have said that the film is not a true portrayal of war, focusing mainly on Caviezel's character and using his dream-like attributes as ammo for their ridicule of the film. Let me say this: HE IS THE ONLY CHARACTER LIKE THAT!! All the others are just as normal as you and I and who's to say that people like Witt do not exist, even in times of war. To me, he embodies a Christ-like figure who even put's himself in the shoes of one of the dead Japanese soldiers at one point.  When people blast this film, I immediately know they are skeptics who are probably negative and who harshly judge the world they live in.  Maybe that's the point of the film too: that this world has beauty but man, left to himself, will eventually destroy it all, even turn on each other.  If you have never watched this film, please don't compare it to other war films. This movie will not make you cry; it will, however, make you think if you allow it to.
On a parting note, I am fascinated by a scene where a young boy dies in the arms of his commanding officer.  I never cried in the scene, and maybe that's what Malick(the director) wanted.  To not cry is to feel like many soldiers did in the past few wars.  Most of them lost the ability to feel and to cry during the war. This movie is a great film but will never get the praise it deserves because of people who compare it to Saving Private Ryan. If you have an open mind and don't have to have everything explained to when you watch a film, this might be for you. If you get your kicks from films that force you to cry, try Saving Private Ryan.",1025049600,15,2370,4.360544217687075

It has an all-star cast: Sean Penn, John Cusak, Woody Harrelson, Nick Nolte, John Travolta, Ben Chaplin, Jim Caviezel, and they're all wonderful.  But what makes this movie so incredible is its atmosphere--the astounding cinematography takes you right into the jungle and shows you the thin line between beauty and horror, an island paradise ravaged by war and the effects it has on men.  This movie is not about blood and guts; it is a mature film about the damage war does to men, both in body and soul.  War does not build up and glorify, it strips down and destroys and this film portrays very accurately how war affects each individual differently, and how ""each man fights his own war.""  If you haven't read the book it's based on (The Thin Red Line), it is very good at reproducing it.  The author was himself a WWII vet in the jungles, just like this story, and shows war at face value.  This movie has no ""ulterior motive,"" no ""special message"" and no phoney emotions drummed up by some Hollywood screenwriter.  This is one of the most realistic films you will ever see, and has been called an ""anti anti-war film,"" meaning it breaks all stereotypes and clichs associated with war films.  This is not Saving Private Ryan--in many ways it is far better and makes you think in a way no other film can.  ...",1024617600,4,1444,4.558139534883721

But I can only give a partial recommendation to those seeking to buy the DVD.
A film like The Thin Red Line demands a lot more in DVD form than the current editions offer.  There are several equally underproduced DVDs on the market, the most extensive of which only offers a Melanesian songs special feature.
The Thin Red Line was apparently around 4 hours in length before being extensively edited to its current 3 hour length.  A deleted scenes feature would be fascinating to see in a future edition.  Also, for that matter, this is a movie that cries out for a director's commentary feature.  Again, this was not done, nor was the standard documentary including interviews with the actors.  In short this was a terribly underdone DVD.  The film itself looks terrific, but this was a missed opportunity to shed more light on the mystery and magic of The Thin Red Line",1020902400,2,1086,4.775401069518717

My opinion is that it shouldn't have gone farther than when he was killed.  Alot of the movie's power and potential are lost in the succesion of overbearing narration (including G. Cloonys speach) that makes up the last 15-30 minutes.

Not to sound elitist, but those who don't like it probablyl don't understand the messages that director Malick is attempting to convey.  In my review I just wanted to point out a major theme that I found in the movie - individualism vs. brotherhood/collectivity.
This theme is clearly represented by a central character Private Witt (Jim Caviezel) who characterizes the need for brotherhood.  Sgt. Welsh (Sean Penn) symbolizes the need for individualism.
The Thin Red Line is in essence the delicate balance between these polar concepts.  It is the line which one must walk during times of struggle, conflict, and strife.
There are alot of existentialist ideas in the film.  Malick does a good job weaving beautiful almost artistic scenery with profound music and philosophical ponderings, while at the same time sharply contrasting with scenes of violence, horror, and dread.

1025968,5,6305438137,"Because it opened five months after Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line was doomed to be compared to it. Because it is genuinely reflective and soul searching, it seemed a letdown to most audiences. It was a boxoffice flop. It admittedly does not have the gloss or the formula plot of Saving Private Ryan, a movie I admired greatly. None of this, however, negates the fact that this is one of the greatest films about war ever made. In a few years, when the two picture's opening so close together is not a factor, I think it may find its audience...The Thin Red Line's tone is so different from Saving Private Ryan's. In Europe, we were comfortable [I don't know another way to put it], since that is where most of us traced our ancestors. The Orient was a place we were familiar with, but which was still exotic and misunderstood. Some critics have accused director Terrence Malick of expressing post-Vietnam views in this movie. I don't think he has. I think that the Pacific theater was especially surreal for American soldiers. It was one thing to battle to retake a city like Paris, France or to save one like London, England. It was quite another to retake a small tropical island, with it population of peaceful, barely dressed native, in the middle of the world's largest ocean.
So, to expect to see a retelling of Saving Private Ryan is a mistake. The battle scenes are equally brilliant, though more stylistic. The soldiers are the same all-American types, mostly from rural areas. These boys, though, express themselves more through body language and inner thoughts than through talking. They are not draftees, but enlisted men who were together for over two years before the war broke out. They have become a family, and as such, they are generally very protective of each other. Their bravery and patriotism is never questioned, but when Lt. Col. Tall [Nick Nolte], a man interested only in his career, gives them insane and life threatening orders, their hesitation is obvious. It is a group response, not an individual one.
It is 1942, and their mission is to rid one of the Solomon Islands of Japanese forces, so that an air base can be built. This is all difficult and brutal business. It is here that some of the audience gets confused. [Don't worry, some critics did, too!] Malick's intentions are to show that mankind cannot separate itself form the rest of nature and to make us see that even the most uneducated among us can see that war is ultimately evil, no matter the goodness of the cause.
Much of the time you hear the characters thoughts... The questions the soldiers ask themselves are deep and disturbing, but are not obscure ones. You do not have to have a degree from Harvard to ask yourself what seed or root the blackness called war came from.
Despite the subject matter, this is one of the most visually beautiful American movies in years. In one scene, as our troops crawl through tall grass towards the enemy bunker, the wind blows and a cloud, passing under the sun, causes a dazzling display of light and shadow. The wonder of this against what the troops are doing is powerful. The film is filled with such images...",1016755200,2,3161,4.6768402154398565

1025970,4,6305438137,"This movie was long, but interesting. The film was accurate and was a good portrayal of fighting in the Pacific in general and of the fighting on Guadalcanal. Throughout this movie I noticed three reoccurring themes: the horror of war, brotherhood, and birds.
 Battle scenes are an obvious reference to the horrors of war, and there were plenty of combat scenes in this movie. After the GI's take the bunker, the audience can hear the thoughts of a GI: &#8220;You see many dead people... no different than dead dogs once you get used to it. You're meat, kid.&#8221; When the GI's are sent back to the camp for a week's rest, the boys are swimming in the ocean and one thinks, &#8220;Can't nothin' make you forget it... War... poisons the soul.&#8221; Later, two GI's have conversation about how war desensitizes a combat soldier:
1st GI: It's a mater of luck whether you get killed... I look at that boy dying, I don't feel nothin'. I don't care about nothin' anymore.
2nd GI: Sounds like bliss. I don't have that feeling yet.
The movie shows how awful war is and how it can change a person forever. I like movies that show war for what it is. Some movies glorify war or show the &#8220;PG&#8221; version.
 The film also talks a lot about the bonds that are formed between the men who fight together in a war. Early in the movie one soldier thinks: &#8220;maybe all men have one big soul that [everyone is] a part of... one big self.&#8221; Even the Captain has strong feelings of brotherhood. The night before their first mission, he prays that God will not allow him to betray his men. After the GI's are sent back to camp, one thanks the Captain for saving their lives by keeping them together and asking to make the flanking move. He responds by telling them in Greek that they are all his sons. He thinks to himself: &#8220;You are all my sons, my dear sons. You live inside me now. I'll carry you wherever I go.&#8221;
 Perhaps the most moving portrayal of the brotherhood was the scene where the GI who was AWOL at the beginning of the movie led the Japanese away from his company. He gets himself into an open field and is surrounded by Japanese soldiers. He just stands there, remembering things from his life. Calmly, he gave his life for his brothers and his country. The bond of brotherhood and the cause made the men fight. This is summed up at the end of the movie:
  Where is it that we were together? Who were you
that I lived with, walked with? The brother, the friend. Darkness, light, strife, and love: are they the workings of one mind, the features of the same face? Oh my soul, let me be in you now. Look out through my eyes. Look out at the things you made, all things shining.
 The other theme in the movie was the reoccurrence of birds. From the beginning, I realized that the director was adding shots of birds, some seemingly meaningless. While in the field, there is a shot of a baby bird, dying. There is a scene where there is a bird in the tall grass of a field where the GI's are. The bird gets scared and flies away. A GI hears the bird, gets scared, and shoots at it. After the GI's take the Japanese camp, buzzards are flying overhead, showing the dark side of life and nature. Back at the American camp, the Sergeant and the AWOL Private have a conversation in a house that was taken over by the GI's. Hanging on the porch of the house is a birdcage with the cage door open, but two birds are still inside. Maybe this tells us something about the illusion of freedom or the illusion of imprisonment. The theme of the birds comes to full circle when the audience can hear the Sergeant thinking:
One man looks at a dying bird and thinks there is nothing but unanswered pain, that death's got the final word. Another man sees that same bird and feels the glory, feels something smiling through it.
 More than anything else, this film looks at the bond of brotherhood that forms between soldiers in a time of war. I felt there were scenes that could have been left out and there were scenes that probably should have been added, but all in all it was a good movie.
The film raised more questions than it gave answers. I liked the fact that it wasn't a &#8220;package movie,&#8221; one that tells a story from start to finish and wraps it up in a nice box. This film left me feeling as though something were unfinished. I like to feel that way about a movie, it means I'm thinking for myself. This film brought a subject to the foreground and asked the audience to come up with the answers for themselves. The writer and the director didn't get together and show us exactly what they wanted us to think. The film was not telling the audience what to think; it was asking the audience to think.",1013040000,9,4724,4.416762342135477
1025971,5,6305438137,"The Thin Red Line is the best war film I have ever seen. But I hate to classify it as that, because if you do and someone reads that it's a war film, they're going to expect Saving Private Ryan. The two were compared when first released because they were released the same year and were both up for Oscars. However, the two are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FILMS WITH DIFFERENT INTENTIONS. So, I won't waste time, energy or space comparing the two.
There is a stellar, all-star cast, but there really is no star. The film has a flexible narrative and the story adapted from James Jones' novel is told from different points of view. This is a problem for today's audiences who are not open minded when watching a film that doesn't play like a standard popcorn flick or T.V. movie. Like Mulholland Drive a viewer can come in the middle of it and not really miss anything as far as not understanding what's happening now. It's like an or circular film that just keeps going - like the war for the soldiers that never seems to end.
This film has been criticized so many times, for so many different reasons. And those who criticize it, also criticize those who like it, saying that they (the people who like it) think that film is philosophical, when really it isn't. Or theat the philosophy is only sophomoric. But the film is about the soldiers and I would doubt that these soldiers were Philosophy majors, so if the philosophy is sophomoric (which I don't feel it is) it's because they are. But I should point out and remind people that Terrence Malick taught Philosophy at MIT, and I would think he has a better comprehension of it that the people who are criticizing his use of it.
I also think that the people who criticize this film are the same hypocrites who hated 2001: A Space Odyssey, until it became a classic, and then started to like it. The Thin Red Line is a film that is ahead of an audience. Like the work of Stanley Kubrick or David Lynch, the film takes more than one viewing to fully understand, which may be impossible. But if you're open minded enough, it is such an enjoyable movie in its grandeur. That is another thing people dislike, its pretensions. But how do they expect Malick to deal with a subject as broad as WAR, and not just a group of soldiers, and avoid the possibility of pretension?
I am however, open minded enough to realize that - unlike some other of the films advocates - this film, like any film, will not be a universally admired work.  Everyone has the right to their opinion.  That's what makes film and art in general so special, everyone sees something different.  And I think that it is more impressive to have a film that can recieve such divergent reviews.  This insures that the film will never be forgotten.  Only the films which people are indifferent to are the ones we don't remember.
Most war film deal with a select few that we as an audience get to know. We don't here. We only get to glance. And we glance at so many people it's hard to KNOW any of them. I have not fought in war, but I would assume that is what it is like. You'd get to know who you're close to, but the others, you would just see.
I think that this film is more realistic about war than most. We don't just see a constant attack. We see the quieter moments. Not all war is fighting, sometimes the hardest times are when nothing happens in life. People always say to ""keep busy"". Well what happens if you don't?
We see the women in these soldiers' life (another thing criticized). I don't know about you, but if I was alone in a war, I'd probably be thinking about the good things in life too - which unfortunately may also turn out to be bad.
The acting in the film is superb. Nick Notle, Elias Koteas, Woody Harrelson, Jim Caviezel are all fantastic. The music is awe inspiring. When the main theme hits a certain point, a few minutes in it's breathtaking. The cinematography - the island - is like a character in itself. Man's war is at the same time a war against nature, against our environment. I can't remember any other film that took such an effective turn in using the camera to make the viewer seem like you are in the film.
I can still remember some of the images. They're imprinted like a photograph burned onto paper.
Whether people admit it or not, this film is a masterpiece. It is one of the best films I have ever seen. And I am glad that I had an open enough mind so that I could see that film for what it is - a work of true art.",1012608000,11,4469,4.340909090909091
1025972,5,6305438137,"I must say that this movie is the greatest war movie ever created, and in my opinion, the greatest movie ever created. The whole story is about C-for-Charlie company, a company from the United States Army that serves in Guadalcanal. It takes you deeply into the heads of at least ten differant soldiers, who explain to you(via narriration) what is going on in their heads. The narriration is not like any in other movies though, because they describe their feelings, and don't always tell you what is going on at the moment. Although the movie can seem boring at some parts, it really never is, especially if you've read the book(which I highly recommend).The war scenes are superb, better than Saving Private Ryan's(excluding the Omaha beach scene, which is perfect). It is quite depressing and I wouldn't recommend you to see it after a reletive died, because it won't cheer you up, but it will make you think, and realize that there is nothing glamorous about WW2. The Acting I rate a Ten, simply because of the all star cast, including Sean Penn, Jim Caviezel, Woody Harrilson, John C. Reilly, Nick Nolte, John Cusack, and ""guest"" appearances by John Travolta and George Clooney(who gets way too much credit, considering he's in it for like two minutes). The cinematography is also a ten, you'd have to see it to believe me. Directing is a nine, everything is very well organized, the sound and music are absolutely perfect,and finally the script, I give a six, because some parts follow the book exactly, and some contradict what the book says, which in some parts is good and some parts it's bad. Oh I forgot to rate the extras, considering this is the DVD version. Well I give the extras a zero, because there aren't any. The VHS version is alot better, because there is no widescreen(which I think is better) and your paying more for the DVD when all you're missing is widescreen. I love this movie, and everything about it, though some vital parts in the book were left out, it still turned out pretty much immaculate. A must see for any war, or drama fan.",1012089600,3,2065,4.675824175824176

1025974,5,6305438137,"I first saw TRL in the cinema in 99 and I came out half bored and very unsure about what I'd just seen, with my mates branding it a complete waste of time and money. Despite this i was still thinking about it 2 weeks after. 6 months later it still remained in my mind: images, sounds, faces, voices.
Curiously, I got it out on video and watched it again and slowly began to appreciate it more and more, like i was slowly opening my eyes, the film had captured something truly unspoken, something deep and resonant, a certain quality you might sense in certain moments from your favourite films or in those peaceful or happy moments of your life. I've now watched it close to 25 times (and still haven't met anyone who actually likes it) and i've never said this about any film before but it gets better every single time i watch it, something new in it always lies waiting to be discovered or interpreted differently, or with new experience related to more intimately, giving it a whole new feeling.
It uses such a different narrative style to anything i've seen,
the way it flows, the way is draws its characters and use of voiceovers is so unconventional it's no wonder that so many viewers are taken aback by it the first time they see it, we're so attached to the conventional narrative structure and rules its hard for us to appreciate or understand something so completely different in its telling, which is why i think it gets criticised as pretencious, boring...: it's a knee jerk reaction to something different, that we don't understand - hell, i had the same reaction.
For me the film is like a dream, like a river that flows, making the film almost organic. There's such life and power, deep feelings and emotions in this film that they don't wash away like your usual drama. Its use of symbols - both intelligent and profoud, the actors, especially jim caveizal, ben chaplin and sean penn, truly amazing, just the look on their faces, those moments of silence between characters speaks volumes. Unlike SPR this film doesn't stereotype the enemy but lets us see their tragedy as well in this war, making them real ppl, a true anti war film. I watch SPR again, despite thinking it great when I first saw it, it now feels so boring to me, so crassly American, so untrue. Now, the first 20 minutes doesn't carry the same impact anymore whereas trl's 40 minutes still resonates powerfully, like explosions of consciousness.
Sometimes i wish all films were like trl, and whenever I see a film that makes me depressed about the status of films today I quickly remember the Thin Red Line. So please, give this film a chance, see it a second time or a third time, let it take you with it, let it sweep you up, throw away your expectations, forget everything you've seen, the journey will be one you'll remember.",1011139200,27,2815,4.565217391304348

I'd rather pay more for the other movies individually than get this one for free.  Thats just how bad this movie is.
Finally, I'd just like to say that they should have (...) the lady who spends the whole movie on a swing.  That would have earned this movie at least three more stars.

1026032,5,6305438137,"When The Thin Red Line was released, most people were expecting another Saving Private Ryan.  They wanted a film that compelled you through intense visual imagery and used that imagery to convey a sense of the horrors of war.  However, The Thin Red Line, at its heart, does not attempt to tell the horrors of war that most people imagined.  Rather, it gives a deep look into many of the important things in life through the medium of war.  Love, and love lost.  The futility of our wars.  How fighting for the sake of fighting can destroy you and many other interesting insights appear throughout this film.
This is a war film that makes you think in order to understand it.  The only other was films I can think of that make one think this much in order to fully comprehend the film and its meanings are The Deer Hunter and Apocalypse Now.  Yet even these films were exclusively about the emotional impact that war has on its participants.  The Thin Red Line gives you a much more broad based view of the effects of war and may very well be the finest war film ever made, if only it were truly about war.",1010966400,2,1105,4.377450980392157
1026033,4,6305438137,"Quite an interesting movie with many memorable moments but a lot of self indulging periods. This pro-religious attitude it had right from the beginning is very unpleasant to every one of us with brains still working. However, compared to Saving Private Ryan this movie is truly a masterpiece. Heroes are almost real humans, multi dimensional, dominated by fear, which was a little exaggerated but never toward unrealism. To all who image war as the cradle of heroes I had something interesting my grandfather once said of his WW2 experience: Most soldiers stood on the ground and refused to fire a single round if not themselves were in immediate life peril. This was in fact acknowledged by American army and policies of training have dramatically changed ever since. Today war is not about compulsory enrollment, but in that time people were literally taken out of their homes ""to fight a war for their country"", in fact on behalf of some mostly irresponsible and careerist commanders. Nolte extraordinarily portrays such a commander who would have no problem spending lives of his troopers for the sake of personal gratifying. The scene with that anonymous soldier getting a letter from his wife who wished a divorce was heartbreaking. In every trooper's soul a tragedy was under way and there was no way to act against it since war demanded pure action and action demands abolition of thought and personality. Quite unfortunate, the former commander departs in glory only to be replaced with an even more absurd one, which implies that tragedy continued. I also remember the breathtaking scene of hill's assault, when Nolte required from a mile distance more to participate while soldiers looking around in perhaps the last moments of their lives. How many people died just because the tactics have been ill-conceived? How many people died in very conquerable Vietnam just because tactics have been ill-conceived? War is not about heroism. As life itself, it's a never-ending compromise for no matter any commander or soldier, attacker or defender. In fact, the most beautiful scene of all has those natives looking with such unearthly detachment toward the rains of bullets which took over their country. Penn's character said: ""Look all around you, nature has no forgiveness!"". It's indifferent to our personal struggles and goes on no matter what. We like to think it exists because we exist, but it's very wrong and quite inverse. Despite its many faults, Thin Red Line is perhaps the best war movie ever made.",1010966400,2,2518,5.055288461538462
1026034,1,6305438137,"I encourage people to avoid this movie by any means possible, no matter what format it is presented in. After a 20 year hiatus, director Terrence Malik returns to show us why he hasn't made a movie in that time. I was truly surprised that Malik and crew did not reduce the lush, jungle splendor of Guadalcanal to an arid desert rock, there is so much scenery chewing here from Nick Nolte playing the stereotypical officer seeking glory and a general's star at any cost to the oh-so-gentle John Cusack who only cares for the welfare of his men no matter what the cost to the mission. This film is full of every anti-war, anti-g.i. stereotype ever seen. Come to think of it, it's full of every war movie gimmick ever done. There isn't an original idea in this whole 2 hour 50 minute snooze-fest! All the grunts wander around in a daze asking ""Why am I here?"", ""What's my purpose in life?"", ""Can't we all just get along???"" OK, not the last one, but you get where I'm going with this...
Maybe I made the mistake of going to see this with a 'Canal Navy vet. When we were all walking out after this marathon he asked ""What the hell was that?"" The film had absolutely no relevance to him. They were all young and on the greatest experience of their young lives! Many had never been more than 100 miles from their birthplaces and now here they were on an exotic jungle island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. To top it all off they were on a ""mission from God"", avenging Pearl Harbor. They were part of one of the greatest military machines ever seen, they were giants walking the earth. There was no confusion, there was no milling about wondering what on earth they were doing so far from home. They were fighting for their country and to protect their way of life. This was at a time in our history that the fate of the US actually DID hang in the balance! This movie portrayed soldiers as weak and full of fear and was totally wrong...I guess it struck such a chord with Hollywood reviewers because it essentially reflected their own lifestyles and attitudes.
The best thing about this movie is that it pretty much guaranteed it'll be another twenty years before Malik inflicts another horrid movie on us.",1010534400,8,2205,4.446913580246914

Another bother about the film is that there are so many big stars with such tiny roles (such as George Clooney-he has a whole two minute scene in this three hour film!). They were probably just thrown in to help it sell. It was a real chore for me to finish the entire movie (I fell asleep TWICE). Buyer beware.",1010016000,5,556,4.304761904761905

1026038,1,6305438137,"There's an excellent reason Mr. Malick doesn't make many movies and this boredom factory of unrealistic war talk, piercing and irritating music, long dragging close ups and singing pygmys is that reason. The people of this planet should unite to get a restraining order barring Malick from being within a five thousand foot radius of any kind of camera. Steven Spielberg had entire audiences shocked and educated on the horrors of war and Malick turned the whole war experience into a poetry reading. Don't get me wrong, but I'm sure just before Tom Hanks took the beach in Saving Private Ryan, he could have taken time out to think about his wife sitting on the swings or maybe even sing with the local natives to pass the time until the next bullet wizzes by. And I love the realism created when an entire army with machine guns can't take a well secured enemy shelter, yet one guy with a six shooter takes them out without any resistance. Mr. Malick, for the love of film goers everywhere, take a lesson from Spielberg, Coppola and Stone and realise that dirty men and a fleeting shot of an amutated limb a war film does not make. What you have conveyed in two hours of 'poetic' dribble, Tom Hanks can communicate the exact same message with just his face in a second. Thin Red Line is easily the most painful movie experince that I have ever had to endure. War is not hell, this movie is.",1006646400,18,1392,4.527777777777778
1026039,5,6305438137,"Malick's problem is that a war film will be pro-war unless it makes an effort in the other direction, in which case it will be...anti-war.
His humility is that the phenomenological experience of war is so different from that of ordinary existence in modern society (apart, of course, from downtown Manhattan on Sep 11) that it makes no sense to be anti-war, either.
If Hobbes was right, war time is a different system wherein different rules apply.  Hobbes' theory was that the moral rules we devise in civil society have meaning only under a sovereign, and in the thin red line, which is to say the border line, between one sovereign power and other (for example, on a small ridge, on the one side of which the sovereign is the Emperor of Japan, and on the other side, the people of the United States) these rules do not apply.
In childish ""war"" films, which reproduce war and a thirst for desparate glory that was cursed by a poet in WWI, nobody goes mad.  Ever notice that?  Nobody in Saving Private Ryan goes mad.
In The Thin Red Line, several men go mad and this is the truth of The Thin Red Line, and the lie of Saving Private Ryan.
I say this because my uncle served as artillery commander in WWII and several men in his command went mad.  Indeed, shell shock, combat fatigue, and undiagnosed post-traumatic stress are the modal injuries, the defining injuries, of modern war.
If we can believe John Keegan, nobody went mad at Waterloo.  When one of Wellington's commander's legs was removed by a cannon ball, he said to Wellington, by God, I've lost my leg.  The Duke looked at him and said, by God, so you have.
Perhaps one could maintain a stiff upper lip, and the illusion that the last moments at la Belle Alliance were some sort of tea-time, if the high technology was Brown Bess and canister.  The media at one and the same time tell us about a progress that is also a stasis, end-historical in that war, despite technological ""improvements"" (that somehow never include the simple ability to clean land-mines) will always be with us, and real men do not go mad.
But as Malick makes quite clear, real men, including Sarge (the sergeant who takes twelve men up the Japanese-held ridge and loses every one) go mad.  This has also been made clear by Paul Fussell's book The Great War and Modern Memory.
It is thought that shell shock, combat fatigue, and post-traumatic stress are basically a comment on the defects of character of the shocked, the fatigued, the stressed-out.  But given that the condition was unheard of in the Franco-Prussian nonsense or in Cuba in '98, then they become instead a comment on war as a solution today.
This film is indeed boring.  You pay to learn about war, then learn boredom, learn hurry up and wait, and learn (as we learn in the scenes in the troopship) how men become philosophers all at the horizon of death.
This film is much hated.  It was released at the same time as Saving Private Ryan and it is entire a rebuke not only to Saving Private Ryan but all those comfortable men who in Hollywood offices would tempt children to dreams of desparate glory, where dulce et decorum est pro patria mori.
But in the scene that begins in the mists of the forest below the ridge line and grows towards the taking of the Japanese camp, this film honors men in a way Steven Spielberg cannot honor them.
It's all very well, isn't it, for clowns like Samuel P. Huntington to talk about the clash of civilizations, as it was for Hobbes to slyly justify Parliamentary sovereignity as etched on bodies in Belfast today.  But as Terence Malick has shown us Samuel P. Huntington will never have the dignity of one lousy slob who this academic's loose talk (his ""clash of civilizations"") leads to some decline, some fold of land, in Afghanistan.
It is necessary to be precise.  Clowns like Spielberg reproduce the ""glory"" of war by draining men of dignity; nobody in Saving Private Ryan has any dignity, and it is necessary, in Spielberg's irretrievably adolescent economy, for a clerk, pressed into Hanks' platoon, to play the fool and coward...so we can transfer our own damn foolishness and utter moral and physical cowardice onto Someone Else.
Whereas nobody in The Thin Red Line is made to be a fool and coward.  The commander, although relieved of his position, has a genuine argument for a recon in force, and Nolte's careerism is also his genuine committment to duty.  This is moving, boring, adult, and anti-war...in the sense that no such men should ever be wasted again.",1006473600,9,4514,4.632040050062578
1026040,2,6305438137,"This World War II drama suspends its plot on the emotional power of brutality and torture of combat.  An American army fighting for survival must take over a force of Japanese soldiers.  (In other words, there is barely a plot.)
First off, the film has a point.  It wants to look good.  It combines actors including: Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, John Travolta, George Clooney, Jim Caviezel, John Cusack, Woody Harrelson, and Elias Koteas.  What would the problem be with such a star studded cast?  The problem is that if focuses on none of them.  The film skips from character to character and the audience learns nothing about them.  The fact that George Clooney is even credited at all is absurd.  He holds a thirty-five second scene in the very end of the film.  He gives a tid-tad speech to his band of soldiers and that's the end of him.
Earlier in the film, Nick Nolte and John Cusack form a conversation after the Americans take over a Japanese hill.  Finally, you think you are going to learn something about a character.  Then ""zzzzzzz"".  Nick Nolte (Lt. Col. Tall) talks about how he's going to make Cusack (Capt. Guff) the star of the war and he is going to give him everything he deserves- then that's the end of Cusack.  He exits the movie unknowingly.  The same goes for Nick Nolte.  Towards the first fifteen minutes, he spits off a few lines that literally mean nothing to the audience.  He's the sort-of tough cookie of the film.  He orders his men ""this and that"" and never stops to rest or wait.  He's the one who seems as though he constantly saying CHARGE!  And he won't take slackers, nor prisoners.  Then, when we really want to see him in the ending battle- he is just gone.  Where'd he go?  It is as though he's just written off the film from there on.
Sean Penn is basically a nonentity in the film.  There is nothing to be remembered from his character.  He like a solid rock that is just lying at the bottom of the sea.  Why is his name credited before the title?  He is of no importance to the movie at all.  I cannot remember one line that he said throughout the film because his character was so meaningless.
The agreeable performances only include Elias Koteas and Jim Caviezel who actually make something of nothing for this movie.  There is actually character with these two.  But the terrible thing is- the two heroes of the film... well--- Koteas is discriminated from his army, and Caviezel is killed.  Once Director TERRENCE MALICK actually builds something in this film- he throws it out.
Woody Harrelson is barely recognizable.  He unclips his own grenade and blows his own body apart, leading up to his memorable line- ""I blew my own butt off.""  Besides the fact that the film has little potential or means to be anything more than an overcasted, mistreated war ""drama"", it is drawn out to the point of tears.
The film isn't really gory for the battle scenes- you just see bombs and hear little gunshots where, then, people fall to the ground.  All these dreams of Caviezel and his wife are so pointless too.  She just divorces him and he dies- what does that say?  There is no hope or joy in this film.  Just because it takes place in war doesn't mean it has to be completely depressing.  It's like watching a stormy day when you have no electricity.  You sit there in boredom and sadness, waiting for it to pass.  That's exactly the way you feel when watching this.  The Melanesian people really don't present a purpose either.  They're just trying to point something out for Caviezel's past.  They want to give him some sort of backround.  But why is it the opening sequence?  Nothing comes from them being in the film.
Underneath this pig slop, you see something of a film trying to come out.  Koteas and Caviezel really try to help that.  There is some dramatic war and brief emotion to be rewarded for this film- but 7 1998 Academy Award Award nominations (including Best Picture)... out of the question!  SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is obviously much better.  If this film had a point- something to look forward to, and not a 10-second clip of big actors who are slapped on the credits to try and promote the film, maybe it would be worth a little something.  If you want a depressing time or even some war/drama nonsense... let this one go for the throat.  Don't be surprised if you reach the FINAL ending at three hours and say that you wasted your time (or even fall asleep).  I only paid a dollar to rent this film at the Anoka County Library, and I still think I deserve my money back.  Expect very little from this WAY over hyped film.  Because, if you edited this film, and took out all the walking, spitted talk, dreaming, and boredom of the entire thing- and just added together the actual performances and few war scenes- you'd only have a 45 minute to an hour long film.  What a waste huh?
To conclude my review- this film could've been brilliant.  It had a brilliant idea.  It could've been everything.  Yet, it's drawn down by big-name actors trying to promote the film when they either carry nothing for the film at all, or are just there for a minute- tops.  The boredom and sappy sadness constantly increases which sadly gives the viewer nothing.  I believe that if a plot cannot be worked or even be given a point by its own filmmakers- why should the audience bother to care at all?  There is no joy to the film, it's just depressing, and it just rows along down that rushing river, reaching its three hours where an audience member says- ""OK good its over.  Oh hey was that just George Clooney right there?""  Then the person sitting next to that person finally wakes up and says, ""Huh... what'd you say?""

The leading elitist entertainment magazines generate thier hype, selling the idea that this director's return will be something of a treat.  You are supposed to take them at thier word when the say the person is a great director, without knowning what this greatness is based upon.
Such is the case with Terrence Malick.  Chances are most of us have never heard of him, yet we are told to be excited that he is finally making another film.  Then, when the film is released, we read about how ""great"" it is, and we want to go see it.  So we go see it, and then those of us with a reasonable level of intellingence wonder what it was that we missed.
In the case of The Thin Red Line, the answer to that is simple: NOTHING.  We are let into the minds of World War II Soldiers as they reflect on the nature of war, and the nature of an amorphous, pantheistic God.  Its just not believable that soldiers had the time or the mental energy to sit and ponder in the midst of such a brutal war.  The film also bombards us with nature imagery that is pretty but cryptic in meaning.  We are also reminded of the Japanese Army's  vulnerability at times, but see strangly little about thier intense cruelty.

1026123,5,6305438137,"this film has been compared countless times to saving private ryan - as is expected because they're both war movies. but they both have such a different presentation that really when you think about it, they are two different films entirely.
there are alot of actors (perhaps too many) in this film that only have a couple lines (such as john travolta, george cloony, and woody harrelson).
this film has received innumerable critisms about how it drags on and on and how it's not historically accurate one way or another. but lets see what we're talking about, we're talking about a film, not a documentary - films are works of art (whether good or bad is dependant on the viewer), films are meant to convey an emotional feeling (Whether sad, happy, angry, etc., etc.). films are not meant to be historically accurate (thats why we have so many films based on fiction - take any stephen king movie,sam raimi, john carpenter, james cameron, or stephen spielberg - they are not historically accurate [if they even relate to history at all] and they are not meant to be).
The Thin Red Line departs from conventional war movies and takes its own path, an emotional path that few films have trod.
some have criticized it for being too depressing, too gloomy and it is depressing and gloomy, but isn't that what war was? i know im contradicting myself by talking about history again, but again films are meant to make us feel something when we leave the theatre, not just walk out and feel nothing - badly made movies do that. if a film doesnt make a cry, then it should make us laugh or gasp or cringe, etc., etc.
The Thin Red Line is an emotional film that is long, yes, but aren't most if not all war movies? 3 hours is not long for a war movie (for example, saving private ryan, enemy at the gates, apocalypse now...).
The cinematography has been the only thing consistantly praised and that is so deserving. the excellent cinematography makes the script seem surreal, like we're traveling in a dream and who's to say that that's not the director's intent...",1003622400,10,2056,4.620218579234972
1026124,5,6305438137,"I really shouldn't have liked this film as much as I did.  After all, it had no plot to speak of, was much too long at three hours, used voice-overs speaking poetry and tried too hard to be arty.  However, it was the only war film I've ever seen that defined the experience of war in a way that I felt it to my bones.  It put me, personally in the action.  I felt the fear, the fatigue and the hard questions that each man had to deal with, and left me with an appreciation of what it is to be a soldier as well as a total disgust at the futility of it all.
The director, Terrence Maliick, did an outstanding job of conveying all this.  He used nature in a way I have never see in a war film.  The beauty of Guadacanal from the trees and birds to the native people is shown over and over again in stark contrast to the slaughter of both the Japanese and Americans.  The tagline of this movie is ""every man fights his own war"" and the close-ups of the men's faces manage to show their inner struggles  by the use of lighting and perhaps a leaf against the backdrop of nature.  There is star power in the cast - Sean Penn, John Cusack, Woody Harelson, Nick Nolte, John Travolta, and George Clooney.  They all have small parts and, with the exception of Nolte as the aging Lieutenant Colonel who has been passed over for promotion too many times and must prove himself on the battlefield, they all blend into the composite of soldiers at war that the director was trying to achieve.
The film was true from its very core.  So deeply did I sink into the video, that I wasn't bored for one moment.  Instead I was there, in the trenches, waiting for the next bullet and captured in the experience.  This kind of movie, of course is not for everyone.  But for those of us who look for the emotional catharsis that is possible in a work of art, I recommend The Thin Red Line.",1003190400,2,1866,4.190476190476191
1026125,5,6305438137,"""Thin Red Line"" is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Sure, It's not as gory as ""Saving Private Ryan"", it's not as violently realistic as ""Ryan"",it's not as fast-paced as ""Ryan"", and it didn't make nearly as much money as ""Ryan"" did, but it had things that ""Ryan"" didn't have.
Like,for example, ""Thin Red Line"" had a lot more character development than ""Ryan"", ""Thin Red Line"" centered more on the men and how the war affected them, emotionally. While ""Ryan"" centered more on the realism of the voilence. That's one of the reasons that I liked ""Thin Red Line"" better than ""Ryan"".
I also liked how ""Thin Red Line"" had beautiful cinematography, such as the forests and the wildlife. Some say that ""Thin Red Line"" was to boring,I highly disagree, I felt that it was realistic by being slow, because when people are in war they don't fight 24-7, there are boring times. So I think it added a more realistic touch to the film. I was a little disapointed that the majority of the cast listed on the cover don't have more than 15 minutes of screen-time. Jim Caviezel does an excellent job as the optimistic Private Witt. And Elias Koteas does a fine job too. I was also ticked off when I eagerly watched the Academy awards to see if ""Thin Red Line"" would win any oscars, I figured it would win atleast one, considering it had 7 nominations. I was wrong, it got snubbed for all seven nominations. As for the special features, there is not much. Not even a trailer. But I am glad that Fox left it in widescreen, and didn't pan-and-scan it. The picture quality is awesome, the colors are so vibrant,crisp, and clear. I wish Fox would release the 6-hour long cut, but considering that Fox doesn't usually do much to their non-mega-blockbuster films, I doubt we'll see it any time soon.
Overall, I was disapointed that there were no real special features (except for some ""Melanesian songs""), but since ""Thin Red Line"" is such a good film, I can forgive Fox.""Thin Red Line"" is a solid buy.",1002672000,3,1983,4.5418994413407825
1026126,4,6305438137,"""Saving Private Ryan"" was of course the better war movie of 1998, but ""The Thin Red Line"" is more ambitious and far-reaching.  At nearly three hours, there are periods where the movie does drag, and at times, the plot (if it can be considered as such) seems to lack a focus.  But the performances (Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, Woody Harrelson, and John Travolta come to mind) range from good to even better, and the film is stunningly photographed.  Admittedly, this film is a triumph of style over substance, and the film's ambitions far outreach its abilities, but it's nonetheless a movie that warrants your attention.",1002240000,3,615,4.838095238095238
1026127,5,6305438137,"The Thin Red Line is a war drama that reached inside me like no other film in 1998. It made realise the true horrors of war, like missing people and regretting killing enemies. The characters are so soulful, developed and well played-out it'll bring a tear to your eye. The acting is brilliant from the mostly-male all-star cast. Sean Penn is strong and stunning, John Cusack is very convincing and Nick Nolte is angry, loud but somehow we see through to his good heart. But it is the brilliant Elias Koteas who takes the cake in The Thin Red Line. His performance is indescribable. A true performance to be cherished, and we rarely get such a strong young actor to bring up such a magnificent portrayal of a man going through a rough time. We don't see enough of George Clooney, unfortunately, but his extended cameo is still surprisingly memorable. There are a lot of excellent things about this war movie, but Terrence Malick's amazing direction truly wins us over. This man hasn't made a movie in 20 years and he has come back with this love-it-or-hate it flick that most of the world enjoyed to the fullest. This is mostly due to Malick's brilliant control over the movie and handling his task with absolute calmness and sureness that it'll do well. Kudos to you. The sound and editing are all fabulous and the cinematography is breathtaking. The score is also very powerful and captures the movies beautiful brutality. Overall, this is one of the best and most beautiful war films to ever be put on screen.

1026128,3,6305438137,"I really wanted to love this film and fully expected to do so after all the rave reviews. Unfortunately despite all it's visual impact the lasting impression is disappointing.  The intention was clearly not to make a typical action packed war movie although some of the battle scenes are indeed gripping.  This a film which looks at the relationships between oridnary solidiers who could die at any moment and the different motivations which enable them to survive the horror that surrounds them.  To this end the film is partly successful but the cod philosphising of the characters (in the form of narration) is less inspiring than irritating.  All too often, the underlying themes are spelled out in a rather clumsy way rather than allowing room for the audience to fill in the gaps. The film is however almost saved by it's quite breathtaking look. Clearly, this is visual direction and camerwork at it's best and the sheer beauty of the images is enough to distratct from the often plodding pace.  The troops crawl through rustling dense grass that is the colour of emerald and the contrast between the heavenly setting and the hell taking place within it is indeed effective.  The cast includes a suprising number of star names in small roles and their minimal screen time re-inforces the impression of the transient nature of intense relationships between troops in combat. The all round excellent performances of the cast together with the many powerful images almost suceed in lifting the whole film to the level of greatness but sadly not quite.",999648000,,1555,4.938697318007663

This is one of my favourite films, because of the impression that it left on me when I finished viewing it.  The cinematography is absolutely beautiful, so on the surface this film leaves an indelible impression.
Another major plus of this film is the fact that it doesn't follow any Hollywood cliches in terms of character development.  This is totally refreshing as the subjects are no longer predictably stalwart or weak. For example, Elias Koteas' character would normally be sabotaging his men's lives by following blatantly wrong orders or killing himself amidst a fanfare of hollywood glory.
Basically if you would like to watch a beautifully concieved film with an interesting plot and sublime performances from Nick Nolte and Sean Penn then see this film, because it really is a work of art.",997660800,,1006,4.911764705882353

1. This movie can and should not be compared to Saving Private Ryan. SPR was an amusing movie, but didn't have much depth. So comparing these two is like comparing ""American Beauty"" to ""American Pie"".
2. Liking this movie has nothing to do with intelligence. I actually get quite upset from people saying that the people who reviewed this movie as a bad one are unintelligent and should go back to watching stuff like ""Die hard"". Actually I think it goes the other way. People who find this movie containing deep philosophical questions, do not understand philosophy. This is the kind of philosophy that a stoner would think up.
CONCLUSION : This movie does work, but should have been much better. What the movie tries to and accomplishes, is making us feel bad and confused. At least I hope for Malick's sake that that is what he is trying to do. If not, he is the most overrated director of all times. The fact that characters don't get enough airtime to make you care about them is actually a good thing. I could believe that in the midst of a batlle you don't have time to get to know everybody personally. That the characters aren't likable also speaks for the movie. A lot of people on this planet aren't likable.
Maybe if this movie is ever re-edited, they could trim it down about 1 hour, remove the voice-over et voila : you do have a good thinking man's war-movie.",996710400,9,1598,4.532871972318339
1026212,5,6305438137,"I know that a lot of people will compare this to Saving Private Ryan but it is completely different. Whereas SPR is about the grandeur of American heros going to save one single private from the atrocities of war to return him to his mother, it is simply a shallow war film that tried to draw viewers in the beginning scenes on the beach. TRL subtlely draws its viewers by concentrating not on the heroism of each characters but allowing these characters to examine their own roles in the war and simply, the ethics of war itself. There really are no heros in this movie but that's okay b/c what they say and think is much more important. Some reviewers (and critics) claimed that it is unreal that a soldier would question such philosophical matters. But is it that unreal? Remember one of the greatest minds of the 20th century (Time), L. Wittengstein wrote one of the most powerful philosophical texts when he was in the trenches of WWI.

So many historical mess ups that this 1000 words can't describe, like fresh fruit for the soldiers?? NOT, only officers got fresh fruit. The soldier ate out of cans, Surrendering Jap Soldiers. Not many surrendered anywhere. Surrender was not in their code. Americans did not hang out with the Natives,ect.  My advice don't waste the time with this movie.

1026214,5,6305438137,"Not many war movies like The Thin Red Line have been released over the past decade . Saving Private Ryan shocked us all with it's brutal fight sequences yet it somehow hesitated to get involved too much with the soldier's soul and feelings . More recently , Pearl Harbor tried to give us a clearer view of what war is like but it was simply too polished and  left you with the impression that the U.S army preferred to send first-class fashion models at it's front line. The Thin Red Line is a whole different story . It includes some stunning battles scenes too but mainly , it sticks to the thoughts that went through the minds of the people who where there. It trashes the act of war and judges it constantly by showing images of the piecefull nature and daily life of the native people of the islands right after the moments of chaos that took place during the battles . Although the cast includes some really popular stars like John Cusack , John Travolta and George Clooney ,the director chooses two less-known yet highly gifted and talented actors to carry the film : Jim Caviezel who , right from the start chooses to be alieneted in his own , dreamy world rejecting the people who conduct the war and their fake ideals and Ben Chaplin who searches for a goal in his life after breaking up with his wife.

1026216,5,6305438137,"Never before in all my movie experiences have a witnessed such a fascinating picture of beauty, violence, and compassion thrown together in such a wide array of colors.  Not enough can be said about this 3 hour epic war film masterpiece to do it justice.  In my opinion it is clearly the best war picture of all time because it captures the thoughts and feelings soldiers had during the war.  This film allows them to share their thoughts with us and understand the horrors of war and the destructiveness of human nature.  The story takes place during WWII were the soldiers of C-company are getting ready to face a brutal uphill onslaught against the Japanese in Guato Canal that the American forces feel will be a major turning point in the war.  What truly works in this film are the many questions the soldiers ask throughout the film during their confrontations on and off of the battlefield.  Each soldier is scarred and distressed in some personal and emotional way. There are numerous ideologies and questions the soldiers ask about their mortality, the cruelty of nature, and the absence of a caring god. Through individual narration the viewer is allowed to feel a deep sense of empathy, sadness, and understanding for that character.  All the actors give outstannding performances, especially Nick Nolte, James Cavaziel, Ben Chaplin, and Sean Penn.  Director Terrence Malick outdid himself by outdoing the cinematic beauty he previoulsy accomplished in Days of Heaven by hiring Cinematographer John Toll (Braveheart).  The filming of the mountains, the animals, and the tall grass plains are visually stunning.  The DVD version of this film is great.  What works here is the picture quality because it really brings out the visual beauty of the cinematography in the film.  The DTS soundtrack also enhances Hanz Zimmer's timely epic score and the numerous amounts of bomb explosions and machine gun fire.

1026217,4,6305438137,"""The Thin Red Line"" had the severe bad luck of being released in the shadow of one of the most favored modern war films of all time, ""Saving Private Ryan."" Oscar buzz was all the rage for that film, which focused on the war in Europe as well as patriotism and courage. ""The Thin Red Line"" chooses to focus more on the human beings at war than the country or mission for which they are fighting. It dives deep into the subconscious of its characters, exposing their feelings in the face of battle and carnage. Though heavily stylized, director Terrence Malick knows where the movie is going, and takes it there in stride.
Spanning a running time of just short of three hours, we're taken on a journey to Guadalcanal, where American troops are landing on the sandy beaches only to encounter a foe that, for a while, seems unbeatable. Their mission: to take over an airstrip and give America an advantage in the Pacific War. It is here that the characters are established: First Sergeant Welsh (Sean Penn), whose only wish is to lose all feeling for the events he experiences; Lt. Colonel Tall (Nick Nolte), obsessed more with his image than with actual victory; Private Witt (Jim Caviezel), a quiet, almost spiritual soldier with a soft yet firm heart; and Private Bell (Ben Chaplin), whose memories of his wife are what fuel his drive to fulfill his mission so he may return home.
Like ""Ryan,"" this film has intense images of graphic violence associated with war and battle. While Malick does not use the same technique as Speilberg, whose film is gritty and never without unsteady camera shots, his slow-motion captures, cut to the powerful score of Hans Zimmer, are just as moving and powerful. Scenes that stick out in the mind are the Americans' capture of a Japanese bunker on a hill, while their raiding of an enemy camp is one of the most moving pieces of cinematic masterpiece I've ever seen in any film.
The second half of the film takes us to where the real focus of the movie has been all along. After their mission is accomplished, the regiment is given a week of rest, during which time each of the characters is given a chance to reflect on the experiences of the previous day. Some of them question their own existence in the face of such brutality, while others try to cope with the fact that they have committed murder. The movie is brilliant for its ability to separate one's feeling of victory with their latter realizations of the acts they have taken part in.
One right after another, the movie brings out unheard of emotions that will stir even the hardest of cynics and critics. The images of war, people crying out for help, breathing their last, and just the frenzied, frantic bravura of it all is deeply moving, one of the best war portrayals to date. The psychological examinations are also very heartfelt, establishing the soldiers as characters, and more than mere pawns in a game of war. Each of them has a monologue that plays during the movie, their thoughts and feelings put into poetry for the screen.
While the movie is particularly preferential in its choice of which characters deserve more screen time, the performances turned in by each actor are masterpieces in themselves. Penn is forceful as the hard yet movable Welsh, while Nolte is believably stern and unrelenting as Col. Tall. Ben Chaplin is perhaps the most emotional character, Private Bell, who is haunted by thoughts of his wife back home. And Caviezel is an incredible addition to the cast as Witt, whose simplistic view of the world sets the mood for some of the movie's most powerful scenes and monologues.
Even those not partial to war films may favor the grandeur and spectacle of ""The Thin Red Line."" A stirring war epic and an intense journey into the mind are swirled into an engrossing movie that tugs at the heartstrings with such a grip you have no choice but to go along with it.",991872000,148,3891,4.656976744186046
1026301,3,6305438137,"After watching 'Saving Private Ryan' and hearing all the hype about 'The Thin Red Line,' my interest was peaked.  The sheer brutality portrayed in the beginning sequence of 'Saving Private Ryan' put me in complete shock.  Up until the end of the first 30 minutes of 'Saving Private Ryan,' war movies never really gave us an accurate depiction of what it's like to go into battle.  What could possibly be going through one's mind as you step off a boat knowing the enemy is pointing a machine gun in your direction, just waiting for the moment when the ramp is dropped.  Up until that point, when watching a war movie, those thoughts never crossed my mind.
With my interest peaked, and another movie about the same war to be seen, I decided I wanted to learn a little more about war in general, and the pain and anguish young men between the ages of 18 - 27 went through.  Me falling in that age group had something to do with it as well.  So, instead of paying $7 to go and watch another war movie, I decided to spend an extra $7 to buy the book.  I wanted to read the book first, and then watch the movie and see how well it followed along.  This was either the worst mistake I could've made, or the best choice I have ever made.  Now that I have confused you, I'll attempt to explain what this means below.
The Worst Mistake:
I have seen the movie, only after reading the book, and have heard/read a lot of great reviews, including the ones on this site.  After hearing/reading all of these reviews, I can definitely see how this movie can be seen as 'philosophical', 'beautiful', 'poetic', etc.  However, the movie, even though it is rather long, seems to only skim through the entire book, hopefully capturing the main scenes and give them a short, 2-minute sequence in which to grab your attention and make you realize what these young men had to endure.
For example a man is lying defenseless in the middle of the battlefield screaming in anguish, while being shot at, desperately asking for help.  No one can help him, for fear of being killed in the process.  The screams become so unbearable, that finally Sgt. Welsh (Sean Penn) risks his life just to provide comfort to the dying man by giving him enough morphine to keep him quite until he dies.  My explanation is basically how the movie interprets this moment, and many other moments: quick and not too powerful.  And after watching parts like this, having already read the book, I knew I wasn't going to be satisfied with the rest of the movie.
In short, had I not read the book, I may have enjoyed the movie.
The Best Thing:
Had I watched the movie first, I may not have even thought to read an excellent book.
It's hard for me to say how I liked this movie.  To be perfectly honest, I didn't like it very much at all.  But, as the old saying goes: ""the book is always better than the movie.""  And in this case there is no doubt about it.
So, here are my recommendations:
- If you have already read the book, and have not yet seen the movie, don't see the movie.
- If you are planning on reading the book, don't see the movie
- If you're not planning on reading the book, see the movie
- If you have seen the movie, read the book (even though already seeing the movie will have clouded your own opinions, and killed your imagination)
- If you have already read the book, and have seen the movie, tell me I'm wrong.",991353600,,3379,4.353503184713376

I guess it all equals profit for the oil tycoons and other slave masters running this country, or the world for that matter. At least Hitler had some kind of motive or ""vision"" behind his 3rd Reich, albeit a bad one for some people. Thus, couldn't it be fair to say that we were as brainwashed as the Germans, but just for different reasons? Like Sean Penn's character contemplates throughout the movie, ""where does this great evil come from?"" Well, I'm guessing technology. Ever since the invention of the wood club people have had to come up with better ways of killing each other, and since our economy is based on technology (a.k.a. clever ways of killing other people) we've had to constantly develop better technology to keep up with our enemies-- more money equals better technology and weapons, thus the vicious cycle repeats itself over and over.

If they'd just focused on Private Whitt a little more, I think it would be a perfect movie.

1026307,5,6305438137,"I imagine many viewers who saw Thin Red Line in the theatre were squirming in their seats as if they were sitting in a pew listening to a tiring Sunday sermon. This is because Terence Malick's 1999 Thin Red Line is far more than a conventional war movie. Although it does contain some conventional elements, it pushes beyond them to explore human emotions regularly associated with war such as fear, loneliness, and resignation to death and dying as well as philosophical questions about why countries go to war with each other. For those who are seriously interested in warfare and its effects on combatants, this film offers a great deal of insight.
At the beginning of the movie, Pvt. Witt (James Caviezel) is absent without leave from C-for-Charlie Company on a Pacific island. In the next scene, he is in the brig aboard a troop ship carrying the company to reinforce U.S. Marines stationed on Guadalcanal. While in the brig, Witt is visited by Sgt. Welsh (Sean Penn) who assigns him to a disciplinary unit where he will serve as a stretcher barrier in the upcoming battle. Welsh scolds him, saying ""You'll never be a soldier in this man's army."" Witt replies, ""I can take anything you can dish out. I'm twice the man you are."" Before the end of the film, the viewer finds out whether Welsh is right or wrong in his assessment of Witt.
After an uneventful beach landing, C-for-Charlie Company marches inland to join other troops in an assault on the Japanese army, which has dug in along the crest of a steep, grass-covered hill that dominates the surrounding jungle. In one of the most hair-raising, extended action sequences between infantry ever recorded on film, the soldiers of C-for-Charlie are ordered to make a frontal assault on the position following an ineffective artillery barrage. They are ordered to the attack by a Lt. Col. Tall, who is portrayed in an Oscar-worthy performance by Nick Nolte. Nolte's performance as Tall anchors the major battle sequence in the film, and is so mesmerizing and memorable that it will remain carved in the viewer's memory long after the movie is over. I've never forgiven the Academy for failing to give Nolte a nomination, much less an Oscar, for his performance.
After an entire squad is wiped out in the first wave of attack, Capt. Staros (Elias Koteas) refuses to continue the frontal assault on the ridge, suggesting instead a flanking move through the jungle on the Japanese position. From his position directing the attack in the rear, Tall screams into the radio phone for Staros to resume the attack to no avail. When Staros still won't budge, Tall comes to the front line to personally direct the assault. What follows shortly afterward in the script is a superbly choreographed combat scene comparable to any that has come before it in the movies.
To the survivors of the first attack who have reformed under the protection of a ledge, Tall says, ""That strongpoint up there, somewhere around those rocks, is the key to this ridge....If we can reduce that bunker tomorrow, I think we can take this ridge."" To execute his plan, Tall hand picks a special team that includes Capt. John Gaff (John Cusack), Pvt. Bell (Ben Chaplin), Pfc. Doll (Dash Mihok), and Witt (Caviezel).
In the morning the team departs. As it advances cautiously through the shoulder-high grass, the camera shifts to the birds-eye view from the enemy bunker. At first, the viewer does not see the enemy but sees only evidence of its presence in the form of spent shell casings scattered over the rocks in front of the machine guns emplacements.
As the team moves into position taking cover behind large rocks, one American soldier is struck down by enemy fire. In the ensuing action, the first assault is broken up by enemy fire and the team is forced to fall back to the cover of the rocks. At that point, Japanese infantryman charge the position repeatedly in groups of twos and threes. The fight boils down to a few close combat weapons including grenades, rifles, pistols, and even a shotgun. Eventually Gaff's team is able to get close enough to throw grenades into the enemy bunker and the position is captured, which makes it possible for the Americans to clear the Japanese from the ridge.
The most glaring flaw in the film, which is truly unforgivable, is the portrayal of captured Japanese soldiers. Every history that I have read of Guadalcanal indicates that the Japanese would not allow themselves to be taken alive and either fought to the death or committed suicide rather than be taken alive.
Unfortunately for Malick and the cast and crew of the film, Thin Red Line was released the same year as Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. At the time, reviewers forced comparisons between the two movies to the detriment of both films. From the standpoints of cinematography and plot, Thin Red Line shares  much more in common with Oliver Stone's 1986 Platoon. The similarities can be found in camera shots of the triple-canopy jungle, mutilated American soldiers left behind by the enemy, and the chase scenes toward the end of both films where Private Witt of Thin Red Line and Sergeant Elias of Platoon single-handedly harass the advancing enemy.
Solid performances in Thin Red Line are given by Caviezel, Koteas, Nolte, and Penn. Cusack is miscast as Capt. Gaff, who Col. Tall eventually taps to replace Capt. Staros. Furthermore, the superfluous cameos by actors John Travolta as Brig. Gen. Quintard and George Clooney as Capt. Bosche are weak and soon forgotten.
The Thin Red Line received six academy award nominations: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Sound, and Best Film Editing. After you see the movie, read the book, or vice-versa.",985478400,5,5737,4.878073770491803

1026341,5,6305438137,"After an absence of god know's how long Terrence Malick returns with a cracker. IMO The Thin Red Line is the best WWII film made and that includes Saving Private Ryan (for my reasons see my review of SPR also here on Amazon).
Malick's ponderous film is a masterpiece from start to finish. Starting with scenes of Gaudalcanal's peaceful indiginous population showing how man can be Malick soon takes us on an emotional tour de force of the horrors of war cleverly built up through the attack on a hilltop japanese bunker. Tension mounts quickly as you can imagine yourself there and how scared the soldiers must be as they're picked off by snipers.
What this film lacks in terms of Saving Private Ryans landing sequences, gore and shock value it makes up for in emotion and human spirit. Above all this is a film about the triumph of humanity over savagery - a theme captured in the character of  played by Private Witt.
The film is packed with marvellous performances, in particular that of Nick Nolte as the general looked over for promotion and who uses his men heartlessly as pawns to erase that painful memory.
The DVD package itself is also excellent with extra features.
This is a must buy.",983923200,,1196,4.6415094339622645
1026342,5,6305438137,"I can't imagine anyone viewing this film for the first time, without a thorough introduction, being able to follow and keep the characters straight -- although the basic plot is quite simple: attack the Japanese position on the ridge.
I don't know what possessed the producers (filmmakers) to break the flow of the story with the repetitive scenes of women (girlfriends & wives) back home.  Where are the mothers?
The DVD package includes a photo album of actors/characters which is helpful in following the story and should be thoroughly read and consulted both before during the viewing of the film.
I rate the film as one of the best war films primarily because of its depiction of fear, courage and the brutality of war.  It's cynical tone is also interesting, but hardly original.  First Sgt. Welsh (Sean Penn) carries the burden of providing the structure for the story's (film's) theme -- ""thin red line"" that separates life from death, fear from courage, dreams from reality, sanity from maddness...
As you listen to the dialogue and voice-over narration, you may want to hit the rewind button or obtain a copy of the script.  The dialogue/narration is crammed with thought-provoking quotable quotes, often easily missed, smothered by the sounds of squwaking and squeaking birds, exploding shells and blarring background music.  (Maybe I need a hearing aid - but I could certainly hear the birds.)
Nick Nolte gives an excellent performance as the hard-driving manic Lt. Col. Tall.  The rest of the cast does splendid work and the cinematography is exceptional.
This film will always be compared with ""Saving Private Ryan.""  To me ""Thin Red Line"" doesn't quite measure up to the impact of ""Ryan,"" never-the-less it's very good and worthy of inclusion in all DVD war film collections.",983836800,9,1790,5.027027027027027

1026344,3,6305438137,"The opening few minutes are lush and full of imagery and feeling. The haunted look on Private Witt's (James Caviezel) face, the eerie chanting of the villagers, the trepidation that the girl had for soldiers and what they represented, the sheer joy Witt got out of simply being able to share in the normal village life, and the dread that he showed when realizing that his AWOL jaunt was up - with the arrival of the US ship. I felt all that and got the mood - brooding, surreal, something about to happen. I appreciated the symbolism too - the beauty of the scenery with sun and shadow playing across the fields of shimmering tropical grasses and the beautiful birds in the trees - the incongruity of it all in a battle zone.
My problem is that after all this - setting the mood, creating anticipation, hinting at deeper things to be...the movie teased me and finally left me with a huge sense of what could have been. After the opening scenes with Witt and his return to the ship for Sgt Welsh (Sean Penn) to ponder over what to do with him, we lose track of Witt entirely, and everything seems to drift. The problem is not the storyline. It's very basic. They're on Guadalcanal and Charlie company needs to take a series of Japanese held ridges.
I recently watched 'The Big Red One' again. This 1980's era war movie used a similar technique like 'Thin Red Line' - the voice over to narrate elements such as background, setting and what was going on in the soldiers mind (though not quite as much, nor as effectively as in 'The Thin Red Line'). There is something else that that older movie did, and did well, in contrast with this movie.  There are only 5 characters to focus on in 'Big Red One'. Sure, there are others that play parts but we are always led back to caring about what happens to these 5. In 'The Thin Red Line' the character we feel that we are supposed to care about - Witt - disappears. Others are introduced but none are really sufficiently developed before they are either gone or someone else is introduced and the focus shifts. For me, this is THE problem with 'The Thin Red Line'. Wheras killing off characters is par for the course in a war movie, you better make sure you're not also removing the one thing your viewers can hold on to; otherwise you've killed off the interest. Unfortunately this is a case of so said...so done.",983404800,,2356,4.453703703703703
1026345,5,6305438137,"The Thin Red Line is definitely one of the best if not the best war movie ever made.  It shows a different side of the people fighting the war, not the war itself, and that is why I think it succeeds.  The movie seems like a lot of disjointed storys with no meaning, but that is exactly what war must feel like.  This was never supposed to be a realistic depiction of war as a horrifying physical experience.  Rather, I believe that it was made to make war look surreal, with all the inherent beauty all around, and yet man still fights.  This is all sounding very pretentious, I must admit, but it is a nice counterpoint to Saving Private Ryan which is a great movie in its own right.  The cinematography by John Toll should have won the oscar, there is no doubt in my mind, but Janusz winning for Saving Private Ryan wasn't at all surprising, since he had won before for Schinders List.  This was never going to win an oscar, I'm just thankful it got nominated.  Miramax and Weinstein's minions sought out the oscar and got it for Shakespeare in Love, which was sick and perverse, considering all of the movies that so richly deserved it.  With this movie, Terence Malick really shows that he is a thought-provoking great filmmaker capable of tackling a wide variety of subjects.

1026347,5,6305438137,"I'm goint to start out by admitting that this movie is boring. This is not a movie that you want to watch for fun. It wasn't made that way, and if you rent or buy this movie expecting to see Saving Private Ryan, then you are in for a surprise.
The Thin Red Line is not for everyone. If you have a short attention span, don't even bother with this. However, if you can discipline yourself to sit through and watch the movie, then you should watch it.
The reason this film excels is because it has value after more than one viewing. The message it is trying to send is subtle and hidden- you will have to think a little and then it will come. Another reason why this movie is so good is because you can find your own message in it.
Here is what I got from the movie: During war, men not only destory each other and their minds, but destroy their environment as well. Therefore, war is not only devastating to individuals and nations, but to nature as well. This is proven through John Toll's excellent cinematography that captures the beautiful yet fragile flora and fauna that the war is slowly and sadly destroying. There are many other mesages hidden away in this movie; all you have to do is find them.
Finally, the musical score by Hans Zimmer is a departure from his usual pulse-pounding scores (The Peacemaker, The Rock) and an entry into subtle background music. It compliments the film well, but it isn't something that you can listen to without the movie.
Another strong point of this movie is that it is many stories in one- there are a number of actors that you can follow, all of whom the war affects in different and yet universally destructive ways.
Please don't bother watching this movie if you don't like to think while watching. Not that there's anything wrong with liking mindless entertainment (Die Hard, The Rock, Speed, etc.- all of which I enjoy), but if that's all you're used to, and if you can't stand sitting through a movie while at the same time trying to analyze it, then you will not appreciate The Thin Red Line.
It is truly a shame that this received 7 Academy Award Nominations and not one single award. Were it to win only one Oscar, it should have been for Best Cinemtography (John Toll)- Janusz Kaminski won it instead (for Saving Private Ryan). The performances- especially those of Jim Caviezel and Nick Nolte- deserved nominations.
""Hard to enjoy, but easy to appreciate."" That is perhaps the best description I can think of for The Thin Red Line. It is boring and tedious, but if you force yourself to sit through it you will truly appreciate and respect its deep messages and thematic qualities.",981763200,,2636,4.528301886792453

If you enjoy movies as high art, inflected with lots of hidden meaning and subtle flavors, you'll love it. However, if you love war movies for being *war movies*, pass on this flick. If you think movies like The Longest Day, SPR, Battleground, River Kwai, et.al., are among the greatest films ever made, you will really really hate this movie. Another reviewer had exactly the same reaction I did, which was about every 30 minutes asking myself out loud ""why am I watching this?"" This is really unfortunate too, because the infrequent battle scenes are *very* well done and show glimpses of how much better this movie could have been. Too bad the battle and directly related scenes take about 45 minutes of this 3 hour film. It's almost as if the director decided to film an analogy to the oft-quoted statment about war in general: ""hours of boredom interspersed with moments of sheer terror"".

It's absolutely poetic, stylish and never hysteric, not even during the battle scenes. The score (OF COURSE not only the score) should have won the oscar (not goddamn ""Shakespeare in love""), the actors - especially Koteas and Caviezel, I think - are doing an outrageous job, and so does the rest of the crew, combining all to the best war movie ever made (in my opinion).

Although it was very interesting into the darker side of war, I was still left wondering what the director was trying to do.  The most tragic scene in my eyes is when a soldier is asked for a divorce by his wife at home who has become lonely.  I was honestly left sickened by this scence by this woman's betrayal.  Very powerful.  The special effects are okay, nothing like SPR, and it is much less graphic than SPR.  On the whole I would say I was disappointed.

People, this movie is great because it lets you decide for yourself the point/meaning - it is not going to spoon feed the answer for you like Saving Private Ryan does (although that movie was laced with symbolism which probably went right over most viewers heads, and is why it won the awards it did).  I am glad that most people hated this movie, it reaffirms my theory that this country is filled with simple minded folk with short attention spans, no appreciation for art, poetry, symbolism, irony, or just plain contemplative pondering.  That is why films such as American Beauty, Magnolia, and The Thin Red Line get blasted by so many, because they are really only meant for the minority of film going people -  the smart, intellectual, pretentious, egghead, idealistic, ivory tower person.  Most people are not going to like this film because it will go over their head!!  I like the movie because of that reason, it goes over my head!!

1026438,5,6305438137,"I make a distinction between a ""movie"" and a ""film.""  ""The Thin Red Line"" is definitely the latter.  If you go into the feature expecting a standard war story full of bravado and patriotic flag waving, you will no doubt be disappointed.  I think many viewers went into this film expecting something similar to ""Saving Private Ryan"" (especially given its close proximity release date).  This is NOT a tribute to veterans, it is NOT a ""hurray"" to America, and it does NOT have the uplift so common to Spielbergian style films.
My primary criticism is that the characters in the film often blend together, both in the accent of their dialogue and the nature of their appearance.  Malick's direction makes it difficult for the viewer to immediately pick out the primary characters, so the viewer potentially becomes lost in the ensemble cast of primary players and inconsequential fillers, not fully sure who to pay attention to.
With that criticism aside, I have to point out everything that this film does so well.  Cinematically, it is a masterpiece.  (I feel the film was slighted at the Oscars, deserving the awards for cinematography, editing, and score.)  Malick uses the American push toward Japan (notably Guadal Canal) as the setting for this war epic.  While the film traces the lives of several soldiers during this timespan, the action truly serves as a backdrop for Malick's own transcendental philosophies and his exploration of war's effect on men.  There was a lot of nature footage intercut throughout the film, effectively contrasting the brutality of war and humanity against the serenity of nature, and ultimately calling into question our own relevance in the natural equation.  The saying from which the film draws its title, ""There is a thin red line between the sane and the mad,"" is explored throughout the film, from a Colonel who will go to no ends in the hopes of furthering his career to a soldier who cuts out the golden teeth of Japanese opponents that he kills.
The story is not so much of a straight forward narrative as it is a glimpse into the daily lives of soldiers and the rigors (physical and mental) that they face.  As many viewers have described it, the film is a form of visual poetry.  It is not afraid to dapple in areas and focus on a serene element of nature, nor is it afraid to flashback to a soldier's memory of the past.  Refractive voice-overs are prevalent throughout the film, and they ultimately contribute to the poetic nature of the film and add insight into the soldier's psyche.  ""Artsy"" would be an understatement in regard to this film; this is one of the few works that I saw in a theater and thought ""Wow, I've just seen something truly remarkable"" afterwards.
As for the DVD release, the print quality was excellent, but it would have been nice if some extra features had been included, perhaps a trailer.  The choral songs that were included were neat, but quirky at best, not something that many viewers would derive much satisfaction from.",977011200,8,3003,4.790697674418604
1026439,3,6305438137,"I rented this and noticed that the previous viewer had given up after about a tenth of an inch of tape, not having rewound it.  I could see why.  This begins as an arty war movie that is not doing either the arty or the war part right.  I would have given up on it myself except that it had been nominated for a number of awards, and I knew there had to be something I was missing.  So I occasionally rewound the tape and listened and watched carefully.  Gradually something began to build.  The impressionistic and stream of consciousness techniques began to pull me in and to mesh with the flashbacks and poetic voice-overs to make a meaningful contrast with the jungle and carnage.  The studied camera work with the long takes on the faces of the soldiers, interspersed with panoramic vistas of jungle and mountain and naturalistic shots of tropical island animals, lead me to believe that in making this, Director Terrence Malick had taken Shakespeare as his muse, in particular the celebrated words from MacBeth: ""...[Life] is a tale/Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,/Signifying nothing.""
As other critics have pointed out, Malick's movie does indeed signify nothing, and perhaps that is the point.  But I am somewhat troubled by such an interpretation of our involvement in World War II.  I would feel more comfortable had such a point of view and attendant techniques been employed in depicting our involvement in Vietnam or even in World War I.  But to imply that the sacrifices made by our soldiers at Guadalcanal and elsewhere in the South Pacific were for nothing is entirely off base.  Almost any war fought anywhere is a monumental waste; but if there is one exception is it without doubt World War II.  We had no choice but to oppose European fascism and the expansionist policies of Imperial Japan.  I shudder to think what the world would be like now, had we not.  Imagine being surrounded by totalitarian regimes with their gas ovens and their slave labor, their policies of racial and cultural genocide.  By comparison, such a reality would make George Orwell's ""1984"" nightmare seem a benign fantasy.
I am also wondering how James Jones himself would feel about this impressionistic interpretation of his realistic novel.  He was one of a generation of writers, including Norman Mailer and James Michener, who found their inspiration in the war in the Pacific.  He is also the author of From Here To Eternity (1951), made a couple of years later into an academy-award winning movie starring Burt Lancaster (an excellent movie, by the way).  I suspect that Jones would have to feel some ambiguity toward Director Terrence Malick's production of this sequel.  Jones certainly did not feel that our participation and experience in World War II was meaningless.  Nor was his personal experience meaningless.  Furthermore to make his novel into a revisionist impression of war as nihilistic hell misses not only the spirit of his novel but the entire point of our involvement in World War II.  I wonder how those who survived the horrific experience of Guadalcanal and similar battles feel about this movie.  I wonder if  they think it was accurate and fair and expressed their sense of experience.
The performances by James Caviezel as Pvt. Witt and Sean Penn as First Sergeant Welsh were excellent.  Nick Nolte as Col. Gordon Tall was also good, although he occasionally reminded me of George C. Scott doing General Patton.  Perhaps the best sequence in the movie was the recollection in flashback by Pvt. Jack Bell (Ben Chaplin) of his sensual wife back in the states and the agony of being separated from her, and then the brutal knife of her letter telling him she had fallen in love with another man.  The inclusion of a third element, that of the Pacific Islanders themselves amid the strife as innocents watching the gladiators, was valuable as perspective.  However what might have been added was the brutality and enslavement they experienced at the hands of the Japanese military.  Malick gave us none of that perhaps because such a view might have detracted from his purpose, that of depicting war as an expression of our nihilistic nature.  Incidentally some have said that this treatment owes something to Tim O'Brien's short story, ""The Things They Carried,"" or even to the spirit of the Thomas Hardy poem, ""The Man He Killed.""  Certainly there is an intentional allusion to Carl Sandberg's poem ""Grass"" when one of the soldiers holds up some grass and says something like, ""This is us.""  O'Brien's short story was an intense focus on the artifacts carried by soldiers and what the bare artifacts implied.  Yes, I believe Malick was influenced by O'Brien, certainly in the sense that this is a strongly visual film.  It's what our eyes see that counts, and not so much the story or what is said.",976924800,3,4832,4.838199513381995

Recently, I decided to give this film a second chance, as I often do when I find myself not liking a movie the first time I see it.  So, last weekend, I rented a DVD copy, plugged it into my player, with a completely open mind, and settled back to view it again.

I was equally dismayed by ""The Thin Red Line"" the second time around. For me, this movie begged the question: exactly how many clich&eacute;s about war can you stuff into three hours? Apparently a lot, judging from what I saw!

Without giving away anything in the way of ""spoilers,"" here's a brief summary of the plot:  a hard-nosed but fair general (John Travolta) orders a hard-nosed but obsessed lieutenant colonel (Nick Nolte) to order a hard-nosed but compassionate sergeant major (Sean Penn) to take his platoon full of misfits up an enemy infested hill...where they promptly get their rear ends kicked, but ultimately prevail.

A lot of rising stars make appearances that are shorter than cameos. All of Bill Pullman's scenes were cut from the film as well as Martin Sheen, Billy Bob Thornton, and Gary Oldman (whom I heard had a role written for him by Malick, but was then told not to show up) I heard the director's cut is six hours and I can only imagine the other three hours are like this film. People praise this film for it's poetry, but it really isn't poetic. It's just dragged out. Sympathy for the characters is on a zilch level because you don't care about them. It's just so dragged out. ""The Thin Red Line"" is like one of those films you had to watch in college that you wish would just end because of it's unnecessary length. Definitely not a film to put in your library.",975974400,5,1840,4.430678466076696

The acting , story line, and script is just as impressive, andi think the characters are really intresting. The visuals are astounding and as gripping as spr,and of course, the sound is just as good. This takes place during ww2, but in a different area than saving private ryan. Most of the action takes place in tall grassy fields or in streams. There are some very sad moments in this, and id reccommend it to anyone who likes war movies.",975801600,,533,4.393939393939394
1026444,5,6305438137,"Whether you like this film really depends very much what type of person you are... Because as I see it all the reviews so far fall into two catergories, loved it or hated/feared it.
Quite simply... Your either Private Witt, or Sergent Welsh!;)
If your like Private Witt: a believer, a dreamer, you'll revel in the beauty of this film, and indeed it is beautiful, John Toll did a marvellous job on the cinematography, Malick's direction is perfectly paced. Like the nightime sky this film is best enjoyed just sitting back and soaking it all in...
Those of you like Sergent Welsh, however, well!... You guys will see straight past the beauty, and just see a pointless overlong film that you'd wish was over soon. You'll analyse TRL, dissect it, try to figure out what's happening, how on earth people can like this dribble. You'll think there's just boredom there and miserable time of it all no doubt.
You will be Sergent Welsh.
...But I sense a spark in you guys who don't like the film yet!;)
Anyway, the actual DVD is a simple enough package, the film, trailer and a few songs, no commentary (right, like that was going to happen with a Malick film!;)) It's just the film with a really, great transfer... no artifacts, great 2.35:1 picture.

1026445,5,6305438137,"this is one of the few films i consider to be a ""perfect 5 star"" film.  certainly its not perfect, but it deserves the 5 stars. some critics seem to say that this film is really a long string of individual scenes depicting an equivalent theme, that can be extracted from just a single 2 second shot of say, the coconut on the beach, or the soldier touching the recoiling plant.  i am also told that the film is just an overdone poem.  Now, I refuse these ideas.  I believe these criticisms arise from the critics' reluctance to forfeit their entire attention to the film's development.  I particularly think most people tune out the earlier statements made by Witt (hope thats his name indeed?).  well, the opening scenes are setting up soemthign that the audience must be lulled into.  The effect is essential to the film as a whole.  Without losing yourself in the opening footage, as I am every time i watch this film, you cannot properly set foot into the melee to follow.  Malick recombines the elements his toolbox to hoist above the mere human skirmish an image that, as a human witnessing the film unfolding, disrupts your inner mentality.  Paste together the water, the human aspirations, the hardness of nature, the softness, the thousandfold conflicts, rebellion, duty, power... throw it all in a heap and lie there with these feelings in your poor brain - then allow Zimmer (composer) to blend it through the lens and what you get is the focus of The Thin Red Line. (maybe not necessarily in that order, or in those exact words, but thats the idea).  if some of the soldiers are gonna pass out, well they'll just have to pass out!  you're wrong there, i've seen another world.",975283200,,1688,4.62751677852349

The soundtrack, haunting,hauntinglelanesian chants,will stay will you for quite awhile. The poening 20 minutes of the film can be seen repetedly,for it is almost a tone poem.

Once again Terrence Malick delivers a deeply philosophical film that is haunting yet immensly beautiful just like his two previous film Badlands, and Days of Heaven (both also amongst the greatest films ever). The DVD of the spectacular film does not dissapoint. The transfer is near perfect preserving the cinematographer and directors vision, while the sound bombards you from all directions, besides the lack of extras this is a near flawless disc.

1026488,5,6305438137,"I'm pretty sure that I didn't blink once in the entire three hours of Saving Private Ryan.  From about the first frame of the film, it grabs you by the neck and doesn't let go.  The Thin Red Line is an entirely different experience.  It is a very slow and deliberately paced movie.  While the opening of Saving Private Ryan thrusts the viewer right into the landing at Normandy, The Thin Red Line takes place entirely in remote regions of the Japanese war.
If Saving Private Ryan is an examination of what war does to men, The Thin Red Line is an examination of what war does to man's mind.  This is the truest antiwar film I've ever seen.  Enclosed in anonymous lush Japanese jungles, teeming with life and death, a small regiment of men are sent on an apparently pointless mission.  Their leader is a career soldier, hell bent on making the most of his war.  Their ranking officers are disillusioned and broken men, and their fellow privates are in way over their heads.  The film follows the thoughts of several key characters.  At first the shifting narration is tough to get used to, but in the end it makes for a deep understanding of the film's themes.
Not much in the way of Saving-Private-Ryan-style grand action happens in the movie.  That would negate the theme of emptiness and meaninglessness this movie conveys with respect to the state of war.  There are intermittent bombings and Japanese attacks, including a fairly exciting river-chase scene toward the end of the movie, but more of the film is quiet contemplation, conversation, and exploration of the jungle.  The real meat of the movie is in the emotions experienced by the characters.  It's not important when the Japanese attack, it's important when one private receives a letter from his wife, his only reason for living, explaining that she has found someone else and wants a divorce.  The moments like that are what make this film.
Another amazing aspect of the film is the visual presentation.  Never before have I seen such amazing locations in any film.  Rolling grassy hilltops for miles, shafts of light penetrating the jungle canopy, sunset on the mountain top, and other amazing images fill the screen from beginning to end.  Every frame of this movie is a work of art.  From the color to the framing, the visuals are nothing less than stunning.
Now the question remains... How is the DVD?  Well, in short, it's great.  This is not a so-called special edition release, and there are scant extras (only a few melanesian songs, which you might actually want to listen to after hearing them in the film), and silent still menus.  The real beauty of the film is in the transfer, which is 2.35:1 in anamorphic widescreen.  If losing any possible extras is the price we have to pay to have such a perfect transfer of this film, it is most certainly worth it.  A large part of the enjoyment in the film is in the visuals, and Fox has done a great job in preserving them for the home release.  I have a pretty scrutinizing eye, and I was only able to see a little bit of artifacting and mosaic at brief moments in the darker and more action-filled moments in the movie (viewed through S-video output from my Pioneer DV-525 player).  That is actually amazing considering the length of the movie and the complexity of the visual information, which is ever-changing and not particularly MPEG-2 friendly (if you know anything about compression).
The sound is actually pretty impressive as well.  Some believe the whizzing bullets and exciting explosions of Saving Private Ryan to be the quintessential Dolby Digital war film experience.  However, The Thin Red Line, with its completely different soundtrack, certainly stands on its own two feet.  The soundtrack is rich with the subtle sounds of jungle life, and it accurately represents the human voices in this largely quiet movie.  The surround channels aren't used nearly as much as in Saving Private Ryan (or at least not as overtly), but when they are, you certainly know it.  Same with the subwoofer.  The movie has very quiet moments and thunderously loud ones, and both are represented in DD with excellent precision and balance.  I have to note, though, that if you have a DTS capable system at home, you might want to pass on the initial release of The Thin Red Line and wait for the DTS version to hit shelves in December.  DTS is always just that little bit better, and it can only enhance the depth of the sonic experience.
Well, I hope my meandering has been helpful.  In short-- if you're a war movie fan, or even if you're just a fan of damn good movies, you definitely want to check this out.  It provides a great counterpoint to Saving Private Ryan, and it's so engrossing that you won't notice the length much.  A completely different take on the same war, and a completely differnt look and sound that are equally amazing.  It's an emotionally and intellectually stimulating film, and on top of that its beautiful imagery and rich sound will give your system a real workout.  And if you have anything resembling an attention span (MTV viewers: watch at your own risk), you won't mind the length at all.  Definitely worth the price tag.",973728000,11,5177,4.702552719200888
1026489,5,6305438137,"The Thin Red Line was better than Saving Private Ryan because it showed how war really is, the men didn't know all the reasons they were there, how they felt, what they feared and how they reacted to war.",973468800,2,204,4.256410256410256
1026490,3,6305438137,"Hmmm.......""The Thin Red Line"".....I waited for this one to come out, as I liked the original version, with Kier Dullea. I haven't read the novel though, so I can't really comment on that. But I wanted to see what Mallick would do with the material at hand and one of my favorite genres. His previous films ""Badlands"" and ""Days of heaven"" were both brilliant and ok in that order. ""Badlands"" I consider his best effort, but ""Days of heaven"" while beautifully shot is, at the same time, stark and extremely empty and manages to make 90 mins feel like twice the length. ""Thin Red Line"" though has elements of both former efforts. It is at times interesting, frightening and beautiful and has some good charaters like Sean Penn's, but it is also tedious, pretentious, annoying and cruelly boring at other times. It feels like Mallick was given too much rein on the film, which results in a sum of parts rather than a satisfying whole. Some of the things wrong with the film are, the length, it really could do with a half-hour cut out of it; one of the lead roles retains a terribly frustrating 'spaced out' look all the way through the movie; there are far too many scenes with a soldier remembering the good times with his wife before he joined up. We get the point the first showing and it is inter-cut at the most inappropriate times too; the voice-overs are utterly useless and they just irritate and are totally unrealistic. Also they don't sit with some of the movies characters on screen. Most of the grunts that served knew that war was crap, because they were in it. They did NOT wax lyrical about it, they just wanted to go home.  However, among the pretentiousness, there are parts worth watching. Sift through the voiceovers and the distracting opening segment and some annoying characters and you will find a wonderful and genuinely frightening main sequence. The taking of the Japanese held bunker. This is breathtaking because it is shot an awful lot from the soldier's point of view. We see what they see. And what do we see...well...nothing. We see grass. Until the first shots are fired and bright orange tracers come flying towards the camera at you/the soldiers. Then all hell breaks out and suddenly we have an entertaining movie on our hands. Explosions go off, shells fly, people get hit and scream out and the war in this ""war movie"" makes its presence known.  This is what we have been waiting for and this section of the film is the redeeming factor of the whole movie and is worth seeing alone. One other redemption is the movie's portrayal of the Japanese soldier. He is presented as human, as frail, as violent and as corrupt as the US soldiers on the same Island. This is a good move as is dispells any stupid propaganda type notions of the films of the past and some of the present which attempt to show the enemy as faceless atomatons doing the work of evil, like the presentation of the Germans in ""Saving Private Ryan"", which severely lets that film down. The humanisation of the Japanese in the ""Thin Red Line"" makes war seem all the more tragc and ultimately pointless.  This is not the best war film you will ever see, it doesn't even come close, however there are great moments in the film, spoiled by pretensions and a needless need to try something `new' with a genre which has been sadly neglected for too long.",972864000,3,3350,4.59866220735786
1026491,5,6305438137,"This movie came out the same year that ""Saving Private Ryan"" hit the screen and suffered from expectations that it was going to be the same style of movie.  Terrence Malick has shifted the WWII microscope away from the battles an into human nature and the epic question of violence as a part of human nature and the search for enlightenment in the face of tremendous carnage.  The novelistic approach gives the film a loose structure that might turn off those who are expecting a ""Battleground"" or ""The Dirty Dozen"" type of storytelling.  For me, this movie was a reminder that there are still artists in the film industry and that it isn't solely about the story being told but rather the willingness of an artist to challenge us to ask the hardest questions of ourselves.",970963200,,773,4.669117647058823
1026492,5,6305438137,"Terrence Malick has a reputation as one of the more eccentric and iconoclastic directors alive today.  He has been regarded at times with the same reverence as Stanley Kubrick, another iconoclastic director.  However, Malick's reputation has been based on just three feature films: Badlands, Days of Heaven, and The Thin Red Line.  All of these films show a very personal, unorthodox method of story-telling, and all of them are mesmerizing films.  Unfortunately, none of these films were great box office successes.  Malick's last film, The Thin Red Line, was sadly overlooked in the shadow of Saving Private Ryan, but in many ways it is the more spiritual and moving of the two films.  I love both films, but The Thin Red Line is such a deep film that encourages so many different interpretations that I have re-watched this film much more often than Saving Private Ryan.  The difference between the two war films is, to use an analogy, like the difference between 2001 and Star Wars (ie., they are both great films but in very different ways).  I won't bother to go into the plot very much, as Malick's aspirations go beyond a straight-forward story.  Besides, there is no central character to Thin Red Line.  It is more the story of entire C Company during the Guadalcanal campaign.  As such, some audiences have found it difficult to identify with any one character, but by broadening his focus, Malick is better able to narrate his cinematic lyrical poem.  In fact, if you look at the film as a visual poem rather than a typical Hollywood narrative, you will probably be able to appreciate the film more. I have just a few words about the DVD, which I purchased.  The picture and sound quality of the DVD are top-notch.  Picture is sharp and clear, and the sound is spread out amongst all the speakers quite well.  The sound quality isn't quite as room-shaking and awe-inspiring as in Saving Private Ryan (especially the DTS version, wow!) but it is nonetheless very good.  There aren't any really significant extras.  There is an unusual section with the Malayasian songs from the soundtrack.  It's like getting a music CD with the DVD; quite an odd but interesting extra.  That's about it, other than the usual subtitles.  Bottom line: if you like films like Apocalypse Now and if you are willing to take the time to watch this almost-3 hour film, you will probably like this film.  After all, Siskel (before he died) chose Thin Red Line as one of his favorite films of 1998, and Martin Scorcese also named this film as one of his picks for top ten films of the 1990s.  So, I  highly recommend this film!",970704000,4,2612,4.717439293598234
1026493,1,6305438137,"My grandfather was in WWII, stationed in Guadalcanal, and if his battalion ever had a CO like the one played by Nick Nolte, that CO would find himself as a KIA statistic pretty quickly. In addition, I don't believe I have seen anything quite as ridiculous as the opening sequence where some guy is swimming, and stares at some woman and her child; is this supposed to dramatic or something? The soundtrack is horrible, the plot is horrible, and the setting is horrible.
If a person hadn't watched this movie yet, they would say, ""how can it be horrible?, it has Nick Nolte, Sean Penn, George Clooney, John Travolta, and Woody Harrelson in it"". The fact of the matter is, the mediocrity of this movie is inexplicable, with a cast this excellent, it should have at least been remotely interesting.

If you must watch a movie about war, watch Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, Platoon, or Saving Private Ryan, because this movie has nothing to do with war. This movie is about some weirdo's bizarre and perverse view of the universe, it is almost certainly not about WWII (I thought it was set during Vietnam initially, the guy in the beginning looks like he's on some sort of hallucinogenic!).

Welsh, the  existentialist, doesn't believe one man can make any difference in the  world. But Witt, the transcendentalist, feels a power within himself, a  completely selfless desire to protect his fellow ""Charlie""  Company infantrymen. To Terance Malick's great credit, neither of these  philosophies emerges as the correct one. Witt gets a chance to prove  himself, but at what cost? Welsh may have underestimated the worth of a  single man, but isn't he still standing at the end?  If you hated this  movie, or found it boring, I feel for you.

1026550,5,6305438137,"As true artists do, Terrence Malick holds on tight to his obsessions. Despite the many years gone by after his last oeuvre the same  motifs that concerned him in his previous efforts are also present in the  Thin Red Line: understanding or lack of it, communication, violence, the  way different persons deal with a certain dramatic situation. His humanist  approach seems to me to be truly sincere, and I think that's what I valued  most of all in this movie. His non-judgamental look on people's actions  stayed with me for a long time after watching the film. Of course James  Jones'novel is in itself a fertile ground for Malick's interests and is a  masterpiece on a whole different level. Perhaps less idealistic, more  unforgiving. I suggest to anybody who appreciated this movie to read  Jones'book as an interesting excercise on comparing each  auteur's'visions. For example, Malick's Corporal Witt is a lovable,  Christlike figure, a tragic, concerned humanist, whose story is the main  thread of the movie. On the other hand, the book doesn't focus on Witt's  deeds as it does on Fife's (who barely appears in the movie).Jones'Corporal  Witt turns to be a more complex caracther: he is obsessed with saving  others, but he's also a tough southern kid, a racist, and ultimately, a  killing machine. Compare him to the 'movie' Witt, whose most otreageous  display of agressiveness are his intense stares to Sgt. Welsh and his  words: ""I'm twice the man you are"".I'm not saying that Malick's  Witt is a  better developed caracther than Jones'Witt. I am not even saying  that they are different (though I find hard to believe that Witt maintained  his racism on his translation to film, on accounts of his ""melanesian  family"").All I'm saying is that it's interesting to appreciate which  aspects of the same caracthers each author chose to focus in, because this  says a lot about each of them, their beliefs and their different  purposes. But what they ultimately share is their concern for all things  human in the context of war. The movie has moments of inmense aesthetic  beauty, the mixture of spell-binding music and gorgeous images, the  constant use of metaphores, the outstanding performances by all the cast  and an intense and thought-provoking story, all contribute to make it the  best film I've seen in a very long time.",967075200,8,2343,4.958762886597938
1026551,2,6305438137,"What's good about THE THIN RED LINE, not equalled in any other war movie I've ever seen, is the brooding sense of menace.  Our troops are advancing on Guadalcanal.  They can't see the enemy.  Gunfire comes at them from  behind bushes and trees.  You're heading into death and you can't see your  executioner.  The point of view of the foot soldier is utterly stark and  terrifying.  The fear and menace of war has never better been captured.  For this achievement, the film deserves its first two stars.  But after  that, nothing.  The screenplay is like a sophomoric bullsession about life,  death, tragedy, love, despair, the Universe.  No one has anything at all  new or interesting to say; it's a retread of every weary drunk-fest  ... session you've ever experienced. The neighborhood bar has more  insights.  The film meanders, it doesn't know where to go.  Nick Nolte  tries his screaming best to be a tough leader, but you keep thinking  ""what a good acting job he's doing,"" and this isn't what you  should be thinking; a really good acting job is not noticed because you're  so ""into"" the film that you forget that they are actors.  Maybe  it's not entirely Nolte's fault--maybe the director simply yelled at him to  scream louder.  I get the impression that Terrence Malick, the director, is  just as bad with actors as he is with scripts.  He has only one good thing  going for him--a great sense of conveying mood.  This is good enough for  fifteen minutes, but it's not enough to carry a whole movie.

1026552,5,6305438137,"A lot of good things have already been said here about this movie , so I will just make a couple of quick observations:
--If you will listen  closely, much of the voice-over narration is prayer, pure and simple.  Consciously or not, the soldiers are trying to make contact with God in  order to survive, or merely to make sense of the horror.
--The basic  point of view of the movie is that of an outsider who is unable to fit in  to the Machine of combat.  The heroes keep hearing a different drummer that  drowns out the satanic commander that bawls in their ear ""kill or be  killed""; they can't shut out a transcendental reality that supersedes  the bloody one they are temporarily caught in.  The musical score  (especially the excerpts from Faure's ""Requiem"") help us share  that perspective.
""Saving Private Ryan"" (ultimately a shallow,  brain-dead story) got all the attention when these two films were released  during the same year.  It took me a second viewing of ""The Thin Red  Line"" to adjust myself to its slower, more profound rhythms.  Get off  the hyper Spielberg bandwagon and check this out.

1026553,3,6305438137,"There seems to be a lot of argument regarding this film on the basis of how intelligent you are. The general trend is: if you're intelligent and arty, you'll like this film, if you're not then your opinion doesn't count.  Well I here and now state that this argument is insulting.  When we  watch films, most of us watch it in isolation; we haven't read the book, we  haven't studied the history. If we are to view TRL for what it is, a piece  of cinema, we should not be saying: 'it's a good film because we've read  the book and know what it's about.' The point is, as a film viewed in  isolation, does it work? And the answer is, sadly, no.
The cinematography  is truly stunning, and it is really for that that this film received two of  its stars. It is beautiful to watch, the destructiveness of man placed  beside the tranquil yet cruelly indifferent world of Nature: in the heat of  a battle scene, a fledgling crawls from its nest; a dying soldier gazes up  at a fragile leaf framed by the sun; fruit bats hang unmoved in the trees.  Where the film is let down, however, is in its story line and the lack of  insight into its characters. Like one of the ensemble cast films of the  sixties ('The Battle of Britain', 'The Longest Day'), we are besieged by a  plethora of characters whose natures we can only really judge by their  actions, characters who disappear just when they are becoming interesting  (Nick Nolte, John Cusack). Indeed, the only characters we follow the full  length of the film are those played by Jim Caviezel, Sean Penn and Ben  Chaplin, and these aren't the easiest men to engage with. Caviezel is a  frequently AWOL private, who seems for all intents and purposes to be a  pacifist seeking some form of meaning from life, yet who becomes, towards  the end, just another faceless soldier vying for heroism. Sean Penn is the  Sergeant whose only goal is to survive the carnage, and that's the most  depth we get. Ben Chaplin's character is the only one that I can empathise  with, and where the third star comes from. The grainy-textured flashback  scenes as he thinks of his wife back home whilst crawling into battle give  the proceedings a particularly poignant air that make his fate of more  concern to you than the others. The tension created by this almost  fairy-tale love story and the effect of war on the individual is then,  however, completely blown. It is a shame, as your attention to this  character quickly falls afterwards because our one point of empathy has  gone and we're not offered another.
The story line of the film is  uninspired, to say the least. It begins with Charlie Company landing on  Guadacanal and having to secure a hill from the Japanese. The first two or  so hours are this objective, a physical progression of the story. But then,  after they have reached the top of the hill, the film keeps going through a  number of ill-fitting action sequences which don't really have a direction  in mind. And then it ends. I apologise for my ignorance, but I disliked the  fact that it gives no historical context; the Americans win a few  firefights, but in the overall battle, are they winning or losing? Or is  that the point, that a soldier's only focus is on his few engagements, a  tiny cog in an immense war machine? At least in films like 'Platoon', the  characters have goals; we merely drift in the last hour of this one. And  what is the 'thin red line'? I take it that the title refers to the  Japanese defenders, but as it is never alluded to, who knows? I guess I'd  have to read the book, eh?
The point of the film is not clear at all.  Most of the characters we follow have poetic, philosophical inner  monologues which serve as a form of narration; oddly, they are all routed  in the same bleakly-allegorical mind. And yet for a film that is  essentially philosophy through symbolism and visuals, it does not seem to  be making any committal or groundbreaking statements...",966211200,17,3950,4.530496453900709

1026555,5,6305438137,"Anyone familiar with James Jones' gripping novel concerning the so-called ""thin red line"" between one's war experience and madness must appreciate  the stunning accuracy with which the latest film version of this  frightening psychodrama plays itself into the experiences of a group of  soldiers about to go into battle at Guadalcanal. History buffs familiar  with the literature (both fiction and non-fiction) emanating from the  Pacific campaign of World war two understand that unlike their European  comrades, the dogfaces confronting combat in the South Pacific fought  short, ferocious, and incredibly intense battles which were then punctuated  by long and frustratingly lonely periods during which too much time left to  ponder the reality of what they had been experiencing was often a maddening  yet irresistible glimpse into the darkness of their own souls.
Indeed, a  number of noted authors like William Manchester, Ronald Spector, and James  Jones all refer to this uniquely Japanese-theater related psychological  syndrome in one form or another in their writings. From the opening frames  of this movie, the actors confront the nature of their own existence as  well as the insane set of circumstances they face as soldiers trapped into  a psychotic situation from which the only sure escape is violent and  painful death. From frame to frame we catch glimpses of this insanity, from  a soldier killing himself accidentally with his own weapon to others  sacrificing themselves for the sake of their buddies. Although one is  comically absurd and the other courageous, both are intensely unlike the  circumstances anyone would experience anywhere else but in combat.
All  that said, the film is a very sophisticated exploration of man's humanity  and inhumanity under circumstances so bizarre and unusual that one must  suspend one's ordinary consciousness in order to survive. The  cinematography is marvelous, and even in the most gruesome and violent  scenes, one gets the feeling all of this is choreographed by someone  understanding the power of the camera to catch glimpses of man's essential  struggle with himself in those moments he is most desperately trying to  stay alive under the most murderous of circumstances. It will probably  never be a film popular with or appreciated by the masses, for most people  simply don't take the time and energy to peer below the surface of what is  happening on the screen to understand what the director and actors are  saying so passionately and beautifully both verbally and non-verbally about  the nature of man, the world we live in, and the incredible things men do  to each other in the terrible prism of combat.",965088000,60,2684,5.235294117647059

The lady was half way right, it does play like a documentary. But that's what sets it apart from other war movies.  Quite opposite from it's counterpart (Saving Pt. Ryan, which was also made  that year) this movie investigates the internal struggle, the soul-  searching of the men who fought for our country. People complain about the  lack of action in this film. My complaint is that many war movies get so  involved in action that the charachters are forgotten. This movie is  different ,though. It shows us the waiting time, while soliders questioned  their actions, reflected upon themselves, or thought about home. This movie  doesn't go anywhere, but then again life doesn't either sometimes. Sean  Penn and Nick Nolte are at their best, as you've never seen them before.  Many performances barely register( George Clooney, John Travolta). Still  others shall move you quite profoundly, more so each time you watch this  movie.( Elias Koteas, Ben Chaplin, John Cusack) Unlike many movies, this  will stay in your mind forever, this one shows what war is about.",963964800,7,1154,4.942708333333333
1026618,2,6305438137,"I give Terence Malick's ""The Thin Red Line"" two stars for cinematography and production quality, but that's about it! I thought this movie was heavily  mis-cast. One wonders what John Travolta, Woody  Harrelson and George Clooney are doing in this movie. Nick Nolte fits in  but overacts as the deranged Colonal. Jim Caviezel's performance is good,  but his role (as of others in this movie) too modern and pacifist for the  1942 WWII situation where the Axis powers' threat to the freedom and peace  of the entire world was real and well perceived. (It's barely a year after  Pearl Harbour when the Army moved in to relieve the Marines at  Guadalcanal). They seem to miss the points in James Jones' book.
Justice  is better done to the book in the 1964 original movie (available on video),  directed by Andrew Marton who, incidently, was involved as secondary  director to such top-notch war films as ""The Longest Day"" and  ""Catch-22"". All the characters in the 1964 original are  believable, especially Keir Dullea's unforgettable performance at Pvt.  Doll.

1026619,3,6305438137,"'The Thin Red Line' is a semi-great war film that makes you want to nash your teeth, as it comes very close to being excellent, but falls down. Largely this is due to a mixture of extreme length, and an irritating  desire on the part of the director to be arty - not a bad thing in itself,  but when the level of insight is that of a Wyndham Hill record, you start  to tire of the attempts at poetry. Fully one and half hours of the film  could be removed without negatively affecting it - the last hour consists  of a series of dull, undifferentiated characters wandering about, muttering  to each other, and undoes whatever greatness there had been up until that  point. The moral, that warfare is bad, and that western society corrupts  nature, is all very nice, but seems rather obvious. That said, it's not  awful, not by a long shot. But whereas the same director's 'Badlands' and  'Days of Heaven' were concise and insightful, this film seems as if Malick  had been desperate to make up for lost time by filming as much as possible.  Over an hour of footage was cut before release. Both the cinematography and  Hans Zimmer's score are excellent, and technically it's masterful. The  actors generally seem subservient to the imagery, but Nick Nolte stands out  as a partially-deranged General, and future star Jim Caviezel seems oddly  out-of-place as a New Age Marine. Elsewhere George Clooney, John Travolta  and John Cusack fail to register, and Woody Harrelson has enough time for  you to recognise him before he blows himself up with the world's least  powerful grenade. Compared to 'Saving Private Ryan', it's a very different  film - it's less forceful, with a more ambiguous attitude towards heroism,  although that does not necessarily make it any more profound. Nick Nolte's  character, for example, whilst initially appearing deranged, eventually  wins through, whilst the 'hero', although heroic, seems to throw his life  away needlessly. In summary, it looks and sounds gorgeous, goes on far too  long, seems to think itself a lot more profound than it is, and coule have  done with some editing.

1026621,5,6305438137,"Everything that's needed to be said about this powerful, revolutionary movie has I'm sure been stated earlier, but I feel compelled to share my view also. First and foremost I have a tremendous amount of respect for any  movie and it's director that has the courage to show war in such an  unconventional manner.  Though there are some particularly intense battle  scenes here, this is not, nor was intended to be solely an action movie and  thus may leave some viewers feeling disengaged. What it does do in it's  breathing spaces is take the time to pose some pretty fundamental questions  about the nature of war and ultimately mankind - if often in a fairly  oblique narritorial fashion.  Without question the cinematography is  incredible, but the real acclaimation may be better directed at the actors  involved here. I found myself drawn to many of these characters, even  though they only revealed their true characters in stages. In this sense I  do think it is an actors movie, these are A-list actors involved and it is  a credit to them and their interaction that they have the power to have us  emotionally locked into their plight with purposefully limited character  development.  Jim Caviezel, who plays a zen-like, soul searching private  completely possesses his role, and looks to be a formidable talent - the  interaction between himself and the always dependable Sean Penn is  cracking. Nick Nolte is highly convincing as a grainy, world-weary and  pessimistic colonel and it would have been interesting to see him having  more shared screen time with Caviezel. Unfortunately we see little of John  Cusack in his role, but there is so much able assistance from the younger  actors here it's all we can do to marvel at the fresh talent.  I came away  from this movie feeling quite shell-shocked, not as much in the sense that  I had been bombarded with action, but that The Thin Red Line had altered my  perceptions about war and the realities and limitations of the world in  which we live.",963014400,3,2011,4.83235294117647

1026623,5,6305438137,"First, I think it's safe to say that this movie went as the most unthanked film by the Academy in at least the last 30 years. Had Private Ryan been done by ANY director other than Spielberg you would have heard about it and  that would probably have been the extent of it. It would have been viewed  as just another gory action/war film, like The Patriot. Malick went so, so  unthanked for this film, and that is the reason why I waited so long to see  it. I think this is Malick's best work to date, and that is because, like  Braveheart and Schindler's List, there are scenes in this film that I will  never completely shake. What about those hauntingly gorgeous lyrical  memories the one soldier had throughout the fighting of the sensual times  he and his wife shared? And that's one of things that works for this movie:  it's so personal.  Second, for some reason the art venders have attached  themselves to this film and like to compliment it for its ""art""  and finesse and artistic finery (or whatever). Well, I don't know what  movie they watched, because the movie I watched was a down-in-the  trenches-gritty, emotionally wrenching, and hard-nosed war film. It's an  exhausting experience. This is hard-nosed acting and fighting, not a  delicate vase.  Third, another totally unthanked and  snubbed-ever-year-at-the-joke-of-an-awards-show actor is in this: Nick  Nolte. I haven't yet been able to figure out what's wrong with the people  that don't like that man's acting. He just gives an all-around powerhouse  performance, and the scene where he was on the field phone with Sean Penn  proves it. The amount of intensity that man put into his acting is  outstanding. This movie is absolutely worth buying and watching - multiple  times.  Also, if you're a Nolte fan like I am, you have to check out  Affliction.",962755200,2,1824,4.803225806451613
1026624,5,6305438137,"The first time I saw  this film, I was not exactly bowled over by it. I  had recently seen Saving Private Ryan and although captivated by The Thin  Red Line's stunning cinematography, I felt the elegiac narrative was  over-long and somewhat self-indulgent.
However, considering it worthy of  another visit, I bought the DVD last week,  and was totally overawed with  its beauty.  I am always loathe to describe a film as beautiful, but The  Thin Red Line certainly is.
Although you miss the grand scope of the  glorious natural imagery, the smaller scale of the television screen  renders this movie more intimacy and makes it feel deeply personal.
The  prosaic narrative running throughout, spoken by a host of characters, is  sheer poetry.  If you allow yourself to be absorbed, it'll make you  consider life, the universe and everything.
Terence Malick doesn't make  many films, and that is a tragedy.  But when he does, it's certainly worth  waiting for.  He has a glorious cinematic eye, and everytime I watch this  film, I just want to know more and more about each character.
The acting  by the main cast is flawless. Elias Koteas and Nick Nolte both excelling.  But for me, the most movingly portrayed story strand is the relationship  between Sean Penn's battle-weary Sgt Welsh and the ethereal Private Witt,  played with utter grace by Jim Caviezel.  Another reviewer described his  character as `almost holy' and I agree.  Witt is oddly detached from the  terrible destruction and decay of war and smiles in the face of death.  Sends shivers down my spine.
As he proved with Gladiator, Hans Zimmer  writes the most stunning scores, and the songs of the Melanesian choir are  a brilliant scene-builder.
My one major quibble with this movie is the  inclusion of unnecessarily starry cameos. John Travolta as the egotistical  general is inappropriate and George Clooney is merely a diversion.  Here,  they should have stuck with lesser known character actors or relative  newcomers - as they did with the men in Charlie Company.
Just 18 months  down the line, time and perspective has worked wonders for this film.  In  ten, twenty, thirty years time, my bet is history will be kinder to The  Thin Red Line than it will be to Saving Private Ryan.  It is little short  of a masterpiece.
Although almost three hours long, apparently a good  hour was left on the cutting room floor.  Can't help feeling a bit of this  could have been included on the DVD.  Perhaps a director's cut, Mr Malick?",962668800,13,2497,4.838095238095238

It isn't extremely organized or  fitting, and it isn't exhilerating or simple.  Neither is killing.  It  doesn't definitively end up on either side of the line between order and  chaos.

I was in neither war,  however what validates my belief that this movie was a joke (historically  speaking) is that few if any WWII Vets came out to speak in favor of the  film.  Not to my recollection at least.

1026669,3,6305438137,"Firstly, I do realize that the purpose of this movie was not to shock the audience, as Saving Private Ryan did, but to portray war in an entirely new manner by concentrating on the soldier's thoughts rather than the battle.  Unfortunately this movie failed in its objective.  If you want to make a  movie based on spirituality and the aftermath of battle then do it in a way  the audience will understand.  These narrations and flashbacks make  absolutely no sense at certain times.  Maybe if you are reading the script  as you watch the film you will be able to fully grasp the message intended.  Narration just for the sake of narration is not a good idea in any genre,  especially war movies.  Furthermore, there was absolutely no explanation as  to what the characters are musing over.  These flashbacks offer absolutely  no insight because we have no clue as to what is going on.  One moment we  are in preparation for battle the next we are whisked away to dreamland  memories of a man, and who we can only guess is his wife, in a loving  embrace.  While this may make sense to someone reading it on paper it  becomes supremely confusing while watching it on the movie screen.  Also,  in every one of these narrations there is a feeling of melancholy and  remorse engulfing the narrator but no insight is offered as to the cause of  these emotions.  Whether or not they feel this way because of their current  situation or because of some great event which hurt them earlier in their  lives or possibly both is never explained.  So we are left with a movie  that is plagued with ambiguous and morose narrations from two-dimensional  characters.  Now some may argue that the beauty of this movie lies in its  ambiguity.  That everyone takes away what they want from this movie and  form their own opinion of the film free from any bias.  But I don't share  that opinion on this movie at all.
Now don't get me wrong it is possible  to portray war in a spiritual manner without taking away from the movie  itself.  Namely, Apocalypse Now and Platoon.  Two of the greatest movies of  all time made great not only because of their grandure but beacause of  their message.  In both these movies there was a set objective and purpose  which the main characters followed.  Martin Sheen's purpose, in Apocalypse  Now, was to seek out and eliminate Marlon Brando but we are able to  understand the enormity of this task by listening in on his inner  monologue. Offering us insight into the workings of his mind.  Charlie  Sheen's purpose, in Platoon, is to survive his tour in Vietnam.  We follow  him as he matures from a naive FNG to a seasoned and cynical marine.  His  metamorphosis is further illustrated through his to his grandmother back  home.  At first he is unsure of himself and his decision to join expressing  that all he wants is to go home.  But in the end he realizes that he has no  home anymore and noone left to write to who would understand.  But in TRL  there is no set pattern that the audience can understand.  We are lost,  almost immediately, in the inner workings of this film.
The reason I gave  this movie three stars is even though it is a confusing film it is still a  tremendous work of art.  The grandure of this film is awsome as well as the  acting and the direction of every aspect of the film.  If you watch this  movie while on mute you will undoubtedly be blown away by its  cinematography and realism of the battles.
So just to recap.  If you  want a movie that will portray the emotional side of war as well as the  realism of battle then you would be better off with a movie like Platoon or  Apocalypse Now instead of TRL.  Only after you have seen those types of  movies will you be able to sit through this movie and even partially  appreciate what the director had intended.",962236800,,3815,4.4824046920821115
1026670,2,6305438137,"I want to like this movie!  I really want to like it!  Perhaps I would, if it WEREN'T the THE THIN RED LINE!  I am a life long fan of the James Jones novel, and I was deeply anticipating this film.  I liked Malick's other  films, and I think he shot this movie beautifully and majestically.  Too  bad that THE THIN RED LINE is NOT a beautiful or majestic story!  Jones'  novel is one of brutality, graphic violence, moral depravity, hypocracy,  and uncertainty.  The movie is more like a transcendental haze, a  walk-through Guadalcanal.  Man as a lost child of the pure beauty that is  the natural world.  At times, it is a poignant, and fulfilling movie.  But,  it is NOT THE THIN RED LINE.
Flaws beside the interpretation show up as  well.  I am a film buff as well as a reader.  I enjoy non-linear films such  as Malick's.  However, his effort here is really the magnification of all  of his directorial flaws.  All directors, all artists have flaw,  weaknesses, (Speilberg's is sentimentality) Malick's is glorifying the  image.  The star of the film is the island, and that would be fine, if it  were a painting.  The characters are weak, many of those who play  prominently in the book are only given lip service here.  It dwells and  drags out certian points and ultimately looses its message (quite different  from the novel).  By the end of the film it had already said everything it  can, yet it rolls on, as if Malick cannot let go.  It's not that its a long  movie, I have nothing against long movies.  It's that it seems long.
The  character of Witt is another problem for me.  going back to its deviation  from the novel, Witt is as close as the movie comes to a hero, but in the  book he is a minor character and a racist.  Far from Jim Caviezel's  transcendental reluctant warrior (although it is a standout  performance).
Finally, the film touches the darker issues of the novel  with kid gloves, it looses the strait forward brutality, the depth of  characters, the subtle plot points, the unique homosexual undertones at  some points, and the final reluctantly eloquent statement on war: that it  is THERE, that is is a brutal fact, unescapable.  Jones hated the  glorification of war, but he acknowledged the existence of heroism, though  not as a superhuman adverism, but as a tragic, forced event, a last resort,  somehing to be respected, honored, but not cheaped by the trivialisation of  violence.  The movie misses this, and its beautiful cinematography and  music cannot bring that back.
Though I know most of the reviewers will  disagree with me here, SaAVING PRIVATE RYAN is a far better film, a far  grittier film, a more realistic and purposeful film.  Though it does not  address all the aspects that Jones' novel does, as a student of warfare, I  see far more of what THE THIN RED LINE is about in RYAN, than in Malick's  opus.  Not that SPR is perfect, its just better.  Better message, better  directing, better movie.  Sorry.",961632000,7,2962,4.625242718446602
1026671,5,6305438137,"Inevitably, 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'The Thin Red Line' will always be compared. It's a curse that can be a good and a bad thing. For starters, each film shows what the other is not - but what one musn't forget is how  the film speaks on its own terms. Since each film is so different they  require different readings. However, because they share the same moral  goal, that is, to convey the horrors of war - it is useful to compare them.
'Saving Private Ryan' for the most part has a linear narrative with  straighforward goals. It is much more visceral and aims to convey the  horrors of war through excesses of blood, guts and artillery.
'The Thin  Red Line' on the other hand, conveys its moral message by showing how  soldiers react AFTER each battle scene. Thus, its drive comes from  emotional power.
Having said that, 'The Thin Red Line' takes you one step  further. It won't be everyone's cup of tea as it breaks conventions of time  and space - forcing the viewer to work hard at making logic of the film.  However, once you can accept this cinematic device then the journey is an  unforgettable one that will etch a shadow in your memory and haunt you over  time.
Here, Terrence Malick worked on instinct that allowed him to free  himself of a constraining storyboard (which is not to suggest he didn't use  one). The multi-voice over narration can be very confusing and I would  suggest multiple viewings. Maybe it doesn't really matter that much if you  don't fully recognise who is 'speaking' because the soldiers (American and  Japanese) are all in the same boat. For instance, in one scene you see Witt  (Jim Caviezel) look down upon a dead Japanese soldier's face buried in the  dirt. The narration is heard from the dead man's perspective -""were  you loved...know that I was too"".
I said earlier, that the function  of the battle scenes were to show emotional reactions. Malick achieves this  with an impact that is frightening. The main battle scene is super intense  with changes from slo-mo to regular pace and exchanges in  foregrounded/backgrounded music and sound - all to convey the chaos of the  scene.
However, the reaction from this scene is even better with  sweeping camera fluidity, a touching score, and poetic narration that it  virtually transcends the physical world. They are dealing with emotions  after all. I can understand that many people don't buy into the poetic  narration but hey James Jones whose book the film was adapted from was  there at the Battle of Guadacanal - and that's good enough for me!
After repeated viewings on video, I finally got to see the film on the  big screen last week and was as moved (if not more) as the first time I saw  it. Once again, I cannot stop playing the soundtrack. It was interesting  that at the end of the film nobody left the theatre as all watched the  film's credits spellbound and leaning forward. If you can't see it on the  big screen then watch it at home and be spellbound as many others have. But  to be true to the film is to watch it from start to end and most of all be  prepared for something different.",961286400,4,3104,4.576363636363636
1026672,1,6305438137,"From the opening shot, which simply tracks an alligator submerging itself in the water, you realize this is going to be one of those movies with gratuitous scenery shots. Well, not gratuitous, per se, because Malick uses  them to ""propel"" his theme of Nature. There are a number of  things I did not like about this movie.
A) If there was a semblance of a  plot, Malick sure didn't care whether the audience could follow it. Venues  change without notice, and begun potential subplots are begun and never  resolved.
B) Every half an hour, I wanted the movie to end. There is no  driving force, no incentive to continue watching, yet I forced myself to at  least finish it.
C) Characters spout philosophical questions that are  poetic on the surface, but are utterly out of place. They don't make sense  in relation to the state of events at the time. Okay, sure, he notes that  Nature is cruel. Yay. There is never any *real* continuation of that theme.  There is man to man battle, and shots of the calm, peaceful side of  nature.
D) There is no cohesion. The entire movie feels like a jumbled  mish mash of images and scenes, like Eliot's ""The Waste Land"",  except that I kind of liked ""The Waste Land.""
Well, that's  that. I found this film boring and nearly pointless. Perhaps I just  ""don't get it"", I'm sorry. It definitely is not a movie I'd  return to for a long time, if ever.",960854400,12,1385,4.497991967871486
1026673,5,6305438137,"Put this to rest. ""The Thin Red Line"" and Saving Private Ryan"" are different movies. Both are masterpieces and comparing them is kind of ridicuous, yet most reviewers fall into one camp or another.  ""The Thin Red Line's"" director, Terrence Malick, has made two  previous films. both masterpieces, ""Badlands' and ""Days of  Heaven."" Both are visually opulent and so is""The Thin Red  Line."" Should war be portrayed in such beauty? Why not? It takes great  courage to show these Arcadian spendors of the Solomon islands being turned  into killing fields. Malick gives most of the screen time to unknown actors  and they are uniformly excellent, like Ben Chaplin and Jim Caviezel.  Sometimes they seem like brothers and that is what it takes to survive, to  establish a brotherhood in battle. Caviezel seems like the soul of this  movie, compassionate to all, even the enemy he must kill, and his quietly  harsh Sergeant Welsh, who can not quite bring himself to feel fully for his  men. John Toll's cinematography is wondrous, showing us the many shades of  emerald green in the jungle grasses, the mountains that take on animal  shapes, a silently malevolent crocodile silently slipping into the jungle  algae. And we see the suffering of the Japanese, their gaunt bodies, their  silent screams of suffering and madness. Hans Zimmer's  musical score is  great. His use of native chants is inspired, as in the opening segment,  young native boys swimming in a paradise lagoon. The battle scenes are  unusual for their perpective; the camera is always a little to the side of  the advancing soldiers  or at eye level, barely able to look over the sea  of grasses. The bigger name actors are good or used sparingly. John Travolta  and George Clooney are wasted, while Woody Harrelson, Elias Koteas, Sean  Penn are strong. Nick Nolte is all bursting, bulging neck veins of anger and  terror as the Commander of C Company, a powerhouse performance. We see  alternate scenes of beauty and terror, fierce firefights, then quiet, and  powerful images of vultures cicling a dying bunch of Japanese soldiers,  multi-colored parrots, fogs hiding exhausted men with fixed bayonets. Many  have complained about the multi-voiced narrations, usually in southern  accents, somewhat vague yet as the movie moves along, we feel these voices  as a necessary part of the story. This is film poetry of the highest order  and let us hope that Terrence Malick doen't wait another twenty years to  make another film. We need his great visual eye and phisophical sensibility  that infuses every frame of ""The Thin Red Line.""",960422400,4,2596,4.985981308411215
1026674,5,6305438137,"First, a few words about the wild difference of opinion about this film.  This is a film that will greatly reward the viewer who is willing to give their full attention.  I suspect a lot of people were disappointed because  they were not able to do so.  Also, while there are some thrilling battle  scenes, this is for the most part a contemplative story.  If you enjoyed  Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket, for instance, you will likely be very  moved by The Thin Red Line.  I also feel that the release timing of this  film was unfortunate because it forced comparisons with Saving Private  Ryan.  The two are very different approaches at storytelling and  filmmaking.
That aside, I found this film to be a deeply moving  experience.  The music, scenery, and cinematography are absolutely  beautiful and strangely complement the tension and anguish that unfolds.  The cast is for the most part outstanding. Jim Caviezel is perfectly cast,  as is Nick Nolte.  However, the two leads look so much alike that I had a  hard time telling them apart the first time I watched the film.  I also  thought the cameos by big-name stars was distracting as only a few really  make a difference in the story.  Some have found the use of voiceover  narration bothersome, but I don't agree.  It allows us to see into the  characters' motives and fears, as effective here as in the aforementioned  Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket.  The combat scenes are among the most  gripping I've seen, perhaps seeming even more so due to the quiet sequences  elsewhere.
This is not a film that will win over casual viewers.  Those that are interested and willing to surrender themselves to the  experience are likely to be richly rewarded.",960076800,6,1720,4.741496598639456
1026675,5,6305438137,"What a profound and moving film. It's difficult to write a review for this film, it's almost a spiritual cinematic experience so how does one put that into words, guess I can't really but those of you who saw what I saw in  this film, who saw past the explosions, will know what I'm talking about.
Mallick is an artist, a true film maker, most certainly not a 'movie  maker'. He asks questions, doesn't give answers, some people say lines like  'what is love, who lit this fire inside us?' are sappy and corny, to them I  say, how so? Are there any more deep questions than this? This film is the  essence of life, it didn't even need to be about war, guess most people  miss that.
The film doesn't follow any kind of rigid plot, in that lies  it's beauty. Like the nature is portrays, this film is free, chaotic,  dreamy, beautiful and in the end very touching. I for one am tired of the  rehashed plot lines of current hollywood flicks, I need films like this to  loosen the shackles on my mind and soul that normal films create.
Sure,  there are segments of society who aren't into these types of films, either  because they don't get them or they just don't like them (not everyone who  dislikes it is unintelligent) but I for one will cherish this movie. I love  that line as they board the plane, goes something like  'you're all are my  sons, my precious sons' I like to think that is the Earth talking to  them.
On a final note, before I sound like a total hippy, the DVD  transfer is superb, great artifact free picture. Of course the cinema is  where this film should really be experienced. Hans Zimmer pulls out the  best score he's ever written, it's kind of derivative of Henyrk Gorecki but  we'll let that one fly this time. The theme that plays as they raid the  Japanese camp is just haunting, it stuck in my head for days  afterwards.
In summary, a rare breed of film from Hollywood, please Mr.  Mallick make some more, the world needs more directors like you.",959817600,6,1977,4.3829201101928374

1026728,5,6305438137,First of all I must say that all reviewers that gives that film less than 5 stars are stupid jerks. Terrence Malick with this film become one of the most profound directors of our time.  Spielberg's Private Ryan in  comprasion with this film is peace of  banal trash.  In our country  second world war theme always were serios subject in cinematography. But I  must say that Malik made something unbelievable. Such intense drama without  any compromise in USA? Yes!  It is TRIUMPH.God bless you Terrence Malick  !,959731200,8,513,4.804597701149425
1026729,4,6305438137,"I can see why many of the people who enjoyed ""Saving Private Ryan"" detested this movie. The former begins with intense and unforgetable realism, while the latter is surreal from start to finish.
I think Terrence Malick was trying to accomplish the opposite of what  Spielberg did in ""Saving Private Ryan"". Instead of portraying the  chaos and violence of war with intense realism, Malick focussed on its  bizarre, disjointed qualities. These included scenes such as the beach  landing in which no shots are fired, and the march through the jungle in  which an aboriginee strolls past the troops with complete indifference.  Malik also tried to show how war is puncuated by gaps in which there is no  fighting, no sign of an enemy and no logic. More than anything else, Malick  attemptepted to get us into the minds of the individual soldiers and  officers. Tall is in command but he is vulnerable and desparate to  accomplish something worthy of promotion. Bell focuses on the erotic  memories of his wife, and Wit absorbs everything that is obscure and  noteworthy around him.
I admire Malick's project but I'm not so sure he  pulled it off successfully. The film is too disjointed, and some of the  dialogue (such as Sean Penn saying ""What makes you think you can make  a difference in this crazy world?"") is stereotypical war movie stuff.
Deep down, I wonder if this is even a World War II movie at all? I  suspect that Malick wanted to make a metaphysical film and simply chose the  Pacific theatre of World War II for the background. Could it be that this  movie isn't supposed to grab us the way ""Saving Private Ryan""  did? Is it possible that the filmmaker wasn't trying to wow us with  battlefield realism but wanted to engage us in a different mode of thought?
I enjoyed this film and ""Saving Private Ryan"" albeit for  different reasons. Despite the flaws of ""Thin Red Line"" I rate it  a little higher than ""Saving Private Ryan"" which doesn't have  much to offer after the first fifteen minuts. This film, at least is  original and doesn't try to moralize with the audience.",959558400,6,2083,4.706371191135734
1026730,5,6305438137,"The Thin Red Line has been a hotbed of debate between its supporters and detractors ever since its 1998 release.  Many people consider it among the greatest films to which they have beared witness. Others loathe it as three  hours of their wasted. If great art can be defined as something which  evokes powerful emotions, then The Thin Red Line certainly will meet that  criteria.  Just take a look as the impassioned arguments for or against the  film in any of these reviews.  I think the reason the film has such a mixed  response is that it reached a far greater audience that it probably was  catering to. The director, Terrence Malick, made two critically-acclaimed  masterpieces in the 70s that, while certainly influencial, never reached a  wide audience outside film-buffs.  With the The Thin Red Line Fox pictures  made shrewd (financial) decisions in marketing it as a competitor to Saving  Private Ryan as the year's best war flick.  Certainly this caused the film  to make significantly more money and also have the opportunity to be seen  by some who otherwise would have probably missed it if it only played in  art-house cinemas. On the other hand, The Thin Red Line was subjected to  the invetible comparisons to Saving Private Ryan despite the two being  worlds apart.  Because of this the standard American-movie going public was  treated to a nearly post-modern film lasting three hours with endlessly  complex messsages and themes.
With the requisite background aside, The  Thin Red Line to be a masterpiece. Martin Scorcese may have put it best  when he described The Thin Red Line (he ranked it the 2nd best film of the  90s) as a film where one doesn't have to watch from the beginning to end.  While there is certailny a linear chain of events in the film. There is no  specific delineation of time and the flow of action is vastly different  from typical Hollywood fare.
The story ostensibly follows a company of  recruits and their endeavors to take Guadalcanal. Malick uses about six  different narrators and doesn't feel the need to differentiate between  them. Some people decry this as confusing. However, Malick's use this  technique relates to his theme of oneness.  Certainly on the first viewing  one will probably not be able to follow all of the plot, but that makes the  film watchable and intriguing repeatedly as the beauty and complexity of  the individual stories become more clear.
Even without interesting  characters The Thin Red Line would be remarkable for its gorgeous,  gorgeous, cinematography.  Though the DVD will never be able to recreate  the awesome experience of screening the film in a theater the transfer is  excellent with rich and full colors.  Possibly even worth buying a 75""  HDTV just to see the film in all of its glory.
In summation, The Thin  Red Line is a film to watch again and again.  I think the more times one  sees the more complex and ineffable the film becomes.  Recommended for  anyone wanted to experience beautiful, complex, though-provoking, and  memorable filmmaking.",959385600,2,3049,4.905511811023622

I'm rare in finding that even Tall is rendered with compassion,  pressured from above, exposing the cost in his own soul in his final shot.  I would have preferred a director's cut DVD, but the economics argued  against it.
Docked a star for slanting the field on the relative  atrocity issue - the Japanese aren't shown as having motivated the  retribution they receive.  Also, for being tactically unclear how the small  group did take out the strong point.

1026736,5,6305438137,"Terence Malick, the director of The Thin Red Line, is an artist. He's only made three films, but there is no doubt among discerning people his films are art and worthy of acclaim, period. Considering a lot of the American  public's mentality (""sports and action=good; books and art=bad""),  and our outrageous obsession with the crass, trivial, and mediocre, it's no  wonder there's a lot of people who cannot appreciate this film.
I notice  three things about many of the people writing negative reviews of the Thin  Red Line:
1. They display poor spelling, grammar, and writing skills in  general, signalling that they probably don't read much. As a writing  instructor, I've seen that people who read a lot generally have  better-than-average writing skills. And if you don't read a lot, you don't  develop much curiosity about the world; you're operating from a quite  shallow pool of knowledge, which limits your ability to appreciate  depth.
2. They lack the ability of acute observation. Malick's films are  famous for noticing and pointing out what the average person doesn't  see--and for this he should be celebrated, not demeaned. I seriously doubt  Malick makes his films for those of you who lack acute observation anyway!
3. They lack the ability to analyze coherently and fairly. If you're  going to ""trash"" a movie, you need to either start with at least  ONE good point about it OR give solid, well-thought-out, coherent reasons  why you do not recommend the movie, otherwise you lose credibility.
One  of the negative reviewers lost credibility with me in just one misspelled  word. He mentioned Malick's ""philosiphy"" (sic).
Speaking for  myself (and maybe others): If you cannot even take the time to look up a  word that most people of average intelligence already know how to spell,  you're not going to sway anyone's opinion, so why bother? I don't expect to  sway anyone's opinion either--I just had to say something about what I see  as a disturbing phenomenon--the deliberate ""dumbing down"" of  America.",958089600,24,2027,5.033132530120482

1026788,4,6305438137,"First off, this is not your average movie.  The incredibly galvanized opinions other reviewers have left show that. Overall, though, this is a very good movie.  If you are looking for high art, you'll get it, if you're  looking for high action forget it!
On the plus side, the cinematography  is amazing.  It is almost like the camera is an auxilliary actor.  The  beauty of the jungle set against the uglyness of battle is striking.  I  don't want to sound too artsy-fartsy, but it's true.  I don't recall seeing  another movie that affected me in the same way.
On the down side,  character development is hit-or-miss.  Perhaps Malick wanted it this way,  but most of the soldiers don't really come across as individuals.  The  career soldier played by Nick Nolte and the moony Pvt. Witt (Caviezel) are  notable exceptions.  Some of the other characters appear so briefly they  don't really leave any kind of impression.  Also, the movie is sort of  free-form.  There isn't a clearly defined plot and I'm sure this put off a  lot of viewers.
Please don't expect this movie to be ""Saving Private  Ryan.""  It isn't and wasn't intended to be.  However, if you watch  this movie with an open mind its power is bound to affect you.",957139200,5,1227,4.665094339622642
1026789,5,6305438137,"Like many of you, I'm an avid filmgoer and have a very eclectic taste, ranging from an appreciation of films like There's Something About Mary to Happiness. I've seen both Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line, and I  think they are both very innovative and brilliant in their own way. And I  don't really see a need to say one is better than the other, because I'm  sure that Spielberg and Malick have a mutual respect for one another and  would not care to engage in such petty comparisons (one cast member of TRL  stated in an interview that during shooting Malick seemed almost oblivious  to the presence of SPR and had only positive things to say about its  success). Both Spielberg and Malick made names for themselves in the '70s,  and just because they took different routes in terms of their artistic  ventures does not make one a ""better"" filmmaker than the  other...just different.
As for the films themselves, Spielberg made it  clear from the outset that he wanted to make a movie that honored the men  who fought and died in the Last Great War (meaning that it was the last war  this country was involved in that actually meant something). Despite the  fact that many film critics attacked the bookends of SPR (the opening and  closing scenes involving the aged James Ryan visiting the military  cemetery) as unnecessary and overly sentimental, Spielberg stated in a  recent LA Times interview that he was completely happy with the film and  had added those bookends specifically for the veterans. He said that when  WWII veterans wrote letters to him about SPR, they almost always mentioned  those cemetery scenes as being the most moving. It's hard not to admire a  filmmaker who is willing to take artistic criticism so that he can most  fully honor a group of older citizens who have largely been disrespected by  American cinema up until Saving Private Ryan.
As for The Thin Red Line,  Kenneth Turan of the LA Times said it best when he closed his review of the  film with: ""Though there are moments to cherish throughout, 'The Thin  Red Line' remains a stubbornly personal film, an artwork that only one  person will understand and appreciate completely. No one need ask who that  person might be."" I think that TRL was a beautiful and daring work of  art, but it cannot be doubted that it WAS a very personal film. It was a 10  year labor of love for Malick, and much of what we see onscreen is a  reflection of Malick as a person: a passionately anti-war philosopher with  a deep-rooted love of nature and peace and the fragility of the human  condition. Many of you did not like the film and got nothing out of  Malick's vision; many of you did. Those of you who did are no better than  those of you who did not. That's the beauty of art--the artist creates it  and then leaves it for the world to take from it what it will.
It is also  important to remember that few living filmmakers equal Spielberg in his  ability to tell a story and to hook his audiences in. That's what he's good  at, but it is NOT what Malick is concerned with. In fact, Malick has a  well-known reputation for spurning conventional narrative and character  development. No, Malick is more concerned with setting a MOOD, with  allowing his viewers to go beyond sitting back and watching a story unfold.  He wants people to FEEL every aspect of what is happening onscreen. Thus,  his films are full of long, fluid camera shots and dark, cerebral music  that many find off-putting.
Indeed, just as Steven Spielberg's Saving  Private Ryan has much in common with Oliver Stone's Platoon, so Terrence  Malick's The Thin Red Line has more in common with Francis Ford Coppola's  Apocalypse Now--another deep, dark, brooding piece of philosophical  filmmaking. The point is, these are ALL great war films; they are just  different and have different purposes. Let's try and appreciate them all  for what they are.",957052800,11,3906,4.662261380323054
1026790,5,6305438137,"It seems here that either this movie gets 5 stars or 1.  Take a look at the comments under the 5-star reviews.  They are all logical and sophisticated.  Now look at the 1-star reviews.  All usually two or three lines complaining about how the action doesn't measure up to  SPR's.
That's not what this movie is about.  There is so much meaning and  themes in each of the characters.  Each of the characters feels real.  The  cinematography is gorgeous.  The music, especially when they are taking  over the Japanese base is touching.  I still have those Melanesian songs in  my head...
Anyway, I most definitely reccommend this film.  It'll make  you think on higher levels.  You may be somewhat dissappointed the first  time seeing it, but once you start it a second time, and start really  paying attention to each of the character's insights and soliloquies, it'll  sink in.
I went to see this movie with my father and an actual veteran of  the Battle for Guadacanal.  A man on the battlefields.  He was enthralled  by the picture, saying that this was exactly what it was like.  And who  better to judge than he?
Some complain about the big movie stars' minor  roles.  I believe this works to the movie's advantage.  By using well-known  actors as major roles in this film, you don't really think of them as  soldiers, you think of them as the actors you see all over the place.  I  certainly felt that way in SPR.

This is a filmdedicated to a select few, if you have no military experience and never experienced combat you will never understand this film. I found the film a very moving experience, war isn't all action but hours of bordom punctuated by five minutes of mind numbing terror. The effect that combat has on young men came through so strongly in this film. The photography was superb, the action spot on and the characterisation close to perfect. I'm glad that most cant understand this film for the true brilliance it stands for, combat will only be understood if you have experienced it,most have no wish to join this club. This is a thinking mans film and as close as you will get to the comradeship in war. Well done, a classic to be remembered forever.",954892800,12,869,4.612903225806452
1026795,5,6305438137,"In Aldous Huxley's novel ""A Brave New World"" an entire society was manufactured and geared toward maximum efficiency and minimum resistance. This was achieved by intellectual stratification, a soothing  drug called ""soma"", and ""feelies."" These  ""feelies"" (holographic entertainments like movies) were uniformly  designed to produce maximum pleasure with ever-predictable stages of  stimulation.
As I looked on with surprise and amusement at how rankled  many American moviegoers were by ""The Thin Red Line"", I wondered  how far off we were from such a society. Read the reviews below for further  evidence: ""It didn't have enough fighting"", ""the plot didn't  make sense"", and ""it didn't have a structure"". Just like  slaves that didn't get a standard ""feelie"" in Huxley's distopia,  many moviegoers were furious that they were watching a film they hadn't  seen 80 times already. The same neurons were not being triggered and they  were not getting their standard pleasure dosages.
""The Thin Red  Line"" is not like the vast majority of Hollywood, independent and  foreign films and that is something to celebrate not protest. This film is  an Opus. Like viewing the Sistine Chapel or an ocean sunrise, where one  begins, progresses through and concludes is entirely irrelevant to the  experience. It is a work of art that challenges its audience and raises  many questions and answers none of them completely. It would be hubris to  claim that this film is only about a few definable things. Not even the  Malick would claim that. One could say that the film is, among other  things, a meditation on our place in nature and how absurd, oblivious and  destructive human beings can be when they lose their connection to it. One  could also say that it examines war, nature, human interaction, and  spirituality, but it does so with the expansive humility of an erudite  observer.
It is a work of art, not a ""feelie."" No one is going  to fully absorb this film in one viewing. No one is going to fully absorb  this film in ten viewings. It is a film to own and savor over many years.  If you see the beauty and profundity in that island, the aborigines, and  Col. Tall's madness you will glean new insights with each viewing. If you  are threatened by a film that does not adhere to the lock-step trajectory  of most ""movies"" than this film is not for you. I'll tell you  though, the pleasures you'll find if you open yourself up to it are  many---and they are new.",954806400,24,2461,4.8389423076923075

Later in one of the films many heartbreaking sequences that same soldiers sits crying in the  rain holding the liver of that very Japanese soldier. The Thin Red Line  which is the best and most powerful film I've ever seen in the cinema is  not a film about plot, but rather about questions. ""Where does this  evil come from? Does our ruin benefit the earth"". Lt. Tall(Nick Nolte  in a commanding performance) as the driven leader of Charlie company argues  that it is in nature for all beings to be vicious ""Look at those  vines, twining , swallowing everything, nature is cruel Strauss."" Thus  begins the central battle of The Thin Red Line, between faith of Private  Witt(Jim Caviezal) and cynicism(Sean Penn), between mindless drive for  victory at any cost(Nolte) and humanism (Eleas Koteas). It is an epic  battle, of ideas, emotions and images.""One Man sees a dying bird and  sees nothing but death, another man looks at that same bird and sees the  glory shining through it"". The film thus puts forward the question of  perhaps a hidden purpose to our suffering to our death in order to make  sense of it all. The criticism that you can't tell the voice-overs apart is  pointless, because that very fact is part of the films theme ""Maybe  all men got one big soul, one big self"". As much as I love Apocalypse  Now and Platoon, these were merely films with political points to make, but  for me this film was more of a spiritual experience. I've seen it 11 times  thus far, and like all great movies, new riches are discovered every time  you see it. The comparison to Saving Private Ryan is apt in my view, as it  shows what a hiprocritical peice of God and Country propaganda that film  was. Even for those who champion that film will have to agree that it was  their first veiwing of the film that effected them most. A second viewing  of that film will expose the cheap manipulations that are buried under the  carniage on the first viewing. Throughout The Thin Red Line characters ask  the great bewildering one ""Let me see things the way you do, Let me  see things the way you do"" and ofcourse are unanswered. Don't worry I  haven't spoiled anything with these discriptions, because the film is an  experience that can't be described with words, it is  dramatically/photgraphically/spiritually and thanks to Hans Zimmer's  brilliant score, musically a masterpiece. As far as I'm concerned this film  should play 24 hours a day at the louvre as a testament to human  achievement.",954374400,6,2593,4.676274944567628

I was expecting it to be a bit  more like Saving Private Ryan, as were the people I was with, and  consequently left feeling like I had been cheated.
After I thought about  it though, the way in which this film was presented was in some ways  superior to Private Ryan.  This movie focused more on the individual  characters and their personal feelings and experiences.  The other thing  that I found amazing in this movie was the camera work, it was simply awe  inspiring.  In the first major battle scene, if you watch the way the  camera is positioned, it really gives you a greater feeling for the way the  battle took place.

(It doesn't hurt to flat out say the film's dedication is to the American  men who saved the USA and ended the holocaust...aka Mr. Spielberg).

The answer is simple, I  see it every time I'm around a wide body of people: the film never pounds  any answers into our heads like most three hour films (such as the recents  films of Darabout, Spielberg, Cameron) ""Line"" is an essay, a  poem, filled with questions and theory. In short we, in our stress-induced  mocha fueled, cell phone powered lives want to laugh, want to cry, want to  lean our heads against our spouse, and dwell in reassurance at a movie. We  don't want to question.. The Thin Red Line is an anti-thesis toward war,  war films, and the modern day pace of living. The film begins with Private  Witt, a AWOL-ed transcendentalist who has found heaven on earth in the form  of life among the natives of the Solomon islands. In this life, Witt finds  no fear, thus he discovers immortality; to give yourself and die without a  fear in your soul. Already, without wide realization, Witt has become one  of the most unforgettable screen characters. He is the most intriguing  character in a war picture since Col. Kurtz of ""Apocalypse Now""  and Hollywood screenwriters such as ""American Beauty's"" Alan Ball  have recognized Malick's creation (just look at ""Beauty's""  character Ricky Fitts and his strong resembalance to Witt). The fact that  so many critics have called Thin Red Line character's unfocused and bland  is truth that the philosopical aspect of film is dying. The characters in  Line are all original (much unlike the cliche roles of Spielberg's  ""Ryan""). Pvt. Bell discovers that lust and desire are interpreted  in many forms, as his hearts contentness fades when his wife explains she  could not withstand the wait for his homecoming. Sgt. Welsh's lonliness is  only unbalanced by his kindness as he realizes that the image of one man  can make a difference. (""If I never meet you in this life, let me feel  the lack.

Possibly  the greatest reason I award Malick's film as the decade's finest is because  it's nothing short of revolutionary. It has much more in common with  ""2001: A Space Oddessy"" than it does with ""Saving Private  Ryan"" like most reviews compare.  Both ""2001"" and Malick's  film construct stances on humanity's present circumstance and idealism.  Whereas ""2001"" stretched 50 years into the future to show how we  destroy ourselves, ""Thin Red"" streches 50 years into the past. It  poses the question: why do we fight one another?

My Dad served in the 7th Infantry 184th Company E and  fought in the South Pacific.  It was difficult for him to speak of the war  as he lost many friends there and saw things that he hoped I would never  see. I wish he were still here to see this film.  From what he did  eventually tell me about his encounters during the battles in the Marshall  Islands, Philippines and Okinawa seems to ring true in this spectacle. The  psychological/physical stress, the endless waiting around before seeing  action, the atmosphere in crowded /hot troop transports, the danger of  boarding landing crafts from a rope net, expecting a battle on a beachfront  and finding no one there only to find yourself eventually facing an enemy  well dug in whom you can not see.  All of it, including the reflection on  loved ones left behind.
This film, like no other war movie I have seen  shows all of this and more.  It is uneven, yes.  However, I can only  imagine how uneven and unpredictable one must become when at one moment one  finds themselves pumping adrenalin to dodge bullets/bombs/death and the  relief or breakdown to those who are left to survive.
Finally, I believe  this film honors those brave men, including my Dad who served in the South  Pacific.  War is inherited in human nature.  Wars effect on those who have  had the unfortunate timing to experience it is not a humane thing.  TRL  speaks to that theme especially and beautifully.",952732800,4,1594,4.616487455197133

 This movie is not only origional in concept but a thought  provoking movie.  Drawn out scences are purposely like so to reflect upon  the moment.  To take in the scenery much like the portrayed soldiers  did.
 I'm most surprised that people have not mentioned the obvious  Christ-like figure played by Private Witt.  He is the withstanding believer  surrounded by Hell, and (SPOILER) sacrafices his life for the safety of his  company(END SPOILER).
 Don't rent this expecting an all-out action flick.  Clarification: Saving Private Ryan(SPR) is an action film, this is a  drama.  Apparently many reviewers were not aware of this before watching it  and very closemindedly destroyed the film for (heaven forbid) time  constraints and lack of action.  SPR is comparable in a completely  different genre of movies.
 It's not an all-out bore though.  The movie  has well spaced action sequences to keep the movie flowing.  The truth  about war is that it's not all action as SPR may have mis-interpretted.  I  am in no way bashing SPR because, like I mentioned, it is good on it's own  merits.
  This entire film is fancied with highly impressive performances  by Nolte, Penn, Cusack, and many others.  I especially like how Sean Penn  and Private Witt perform the entire dramatic appeal of SPR in a five minute  argument about how much one human life was worth in war.
  It almost  makes a mockery of Speilberg's falling dramatic attempts in his recent  drama films.  Schindler's List is one of my favorite films of all time.  Amistad is somewhere in the middle to upper.  SPR is not even on the list.  It's next to Star Wars in the action category.
 It doesn't feel right  ending this review on that note but alas I must stop.  Thin Red Line is a  brilliant film that is as cinematic as it is thought provoking.  By all  means rent it before you buy it.  But my recommendation to serious film  fans is to buy ASAP.",952300800,6,2146,4.629032258064516
1026910,5,6305438137,"While the book focusses mainly on the thoughts of the cowardly Corporal Fife, the film successfully manages to float between the thoughts of around eight of the soldiers seamlessly. On comparison between the book and the  film (which are inevitable), you'll notice that the characters in the film  are far more romantic than they were in the book. I feel this greatly helps  add to Malicks' celluloid masterpiece as the characters innate spirituality  blends perflects with John Tolls fantastic cinematography. YOU MUST WATCH  THIS FILM IN WIDESCREEN. While Private Ryan and many other war films  concentrate on plot, TTRL focuses on the characters plight and in  understanding the emotions of the characters you will understand the film.
This film also boasts a fine score by Hans Zimmer, again neatly  sidestepping all of the usual war film cliches.
Unfortunately, this  cinematic tour de force is only hampered by the poor DVD it is supplied on  - i.e. no directors commentry or deleted scenes. No discussion of the  production and how the focus of the film moved from Fife to Witt. This  would have been of great interest.

I don't  think there are words deserving enough to describe this movie.

1026943,5,6305438137,"That I would be lost, hidding like a frightened little child from the blood and the sweat and the killing. That I would become like a raving madman, that I would lose all sense of reality was never my intention.  Likewise, that I would find an implacable sense of peace and joy in death  itself was, to my astonishment, never revealed to me before.
But then,  Terrence Malick's THE THIN RED LINE is no ordinary movie.
I thought long  and hard how to express in simple terms what THE THIN RED LINE was all  about, certain that I could find just the right words to explain it, but  the truth is that war is different for each and everyone of us, and no  single account or recollection is absolute or correct. This is a fact that  Malick understands perfectly, based on James Jones stunningly gripping  novel, THE THIN RED LINE is a multi-layered story about men and war, life  and death, courage and fear, compassion and madness, indeed there are so  many dualities pictured in this movie than trying to list them all would be  impossible.
It's been a while since I have seen such a powerful story  told so well, from John Toll's amazing Oscar nominated photography, to  Malick's own direction. With a powerful cast of actors, including  outstanding performances by Ben Chaplin, Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, Jim  Caviezel and Elias Koteas, this is a movie that deserves to be seen time  and time again.
The DVD edition of the movie is, hands down, one of the  best transfers I have seen. The image is crisp and clear with no visible  artifacts. Although not specified on the sleeve's specs, the 2.35:1  widescreen ratio features a gorgeous anamorphic transfer. You also have  dolby digital 5.1 and dolby surround 2.0 to choose from. The only bonus  feature to speak of is a collection of Melanesian songs that, unless you're  a fan, won't seem like much. Still, the movie speaks for itself and I  highly, highly recommend it.

In the first case, the movie DOES have a plot and it focuses mostly on FOUR  major characters. Secondly, although it is roughly three hours, there is a  lot of action and conflict. Thirdly, although comparisons are inevitable,  all three war movies have strong points and shortcommings. If you've seen  Badlands and Days of Heaven, you'll be happy to learn that Malick continues  to provide beautiful prose with stunning imagry (John Toll) and moving  music (Hans Zimmer). This is an intelligent film on the conflicts/horrors  of war and the toll it exacts on mens' lives. Malick's unique vision is one  that I hope we see again---soon.",951696000,4,783,4.7481481481481485
1026945,5,6305438137,"This is a cinematic feast that is unlikely to be appreciated by audiences reared upon a diet of dumbed-down Hollywood action fare.  However, if you're prepared to sit down and watch this film with no interruptions and  give it the attention it deserves, you may end up agreeing with me that  this is one of the most powerful and evocative films of the 90's.
I hope  that the poor performance of The Thin Red Line's box-office does not mean  we will have to wait another 20 years for Terrence Malick to direct his  next feature.  This man is a craftsman and directors like him must be  encouraged to continue providing intelligent, thought-provoking fare such  as this.  Like David Lean, Malick's films are alive with a sense of pure  cinema with every frame delivering such detail and richness that you could  swear you were there.
It's a measure of Malick's complete disinterest  with the normal conventions of Hollywood that actors such as Lucas Haas,  Vigo Mortensen, Jason Patric, Mickey Rourke, Martin Sheen, Billy Bob  Thornton, all spent months in Queensland and the Solomon Islands filming  roles that ultimately ended up on the cutting room floor.  Blink and you'll  also miss major league players such as John Travolta and George Clooney.  The stand-out performances come from Jim Caviezel and, especially, Nick  Nolte.  Nolte just seems to be getting better and better as he gets older  and his portrayal of Colonel Tall is something to see.  I have never seen  anyone expressed so perfectly his sense of range and anger than Noltes does  here.  It's a fantastic performance from a real pro and it's a mystery to  me why he didn't get an Oscar.
You won't see a more beautiful film about  the horrors of war than this.  To me, movies like The Thin Red Line are  worth trawling through all the dumb formula Hollywood junk we get spoon-fed  with on a weekly basis.  Long may they live.",951609600,10,1893,4.729230769230769

Granted, it is not a classically linear movie...it has multiple points  of view among other things.  But taken together as a whole, if you have the  capacity to be emotionally moved by a painting or a song or a work of art  then you might really like this.
If you are in the mood to see  cookie-cutter, feel-good swill, avoid this movie!  I don't begrudge a lot  of people for disliking this movie though, I think a big part of that was  the way it was marketed.  You just have to be in the right mood for it.  A  good analogy:  You wouldn't go to a bar one night and get all liquored up  and then go to an art museum.  Likewise, you wouldn't try to attempt to  watch this movie with the intent of seeing a feel-good action flick.

Although I enjoyed ""Saving Private Ryan,"" and found ""Shakespeare in Love"" to be absolutely  wonderful, neither film could match the profundity, depth, and utter beauty  of ""The Thin Red Line."" In truth, ""Saving Private  Ryan,"" and ""The Thin Red Line"" should never be compared  because their tones are so strikingly different. Yet Malick's  representation of WWII is far more realistic, and less jingoistic than  Spielberg's. Whereas Spielberg treats war as a necessary evil in  ""Saving Private Ryan"" and looks at each one of his characters as  a hero, Malick questions why people fight in the face of Eden and reveals  his characters as flawed. There is no dramatic salute scene or shot of a  waving American flag in ""The Thin Red Line,"" for Malick's aim is  far deeper than that of Spielberg's. Not only are the films performances  well executed, and its themes amazingly explored, but ""The Thin Red  Line"" is one of the most visually beautiful films created in recent  history. The shots of waving grass exhibit the extreme beauty of  Guadanacanal, and serve as the perfect contrast to the horrors of war the  picture presents.

The only reason this  garnered such critical acclaim is because it was such a calculatedly  ""important"" film that no critic could resist a chance to exhibit  just how deep they really are.  Too bad no one goes to the movies to be  merely entertained anymore.  If you really want to watch a war movie  commenting on the human condition, give Apocalypse Now another go round.

But you would  be missing out on an extraordinary piece of cinema. Thin Red Line succeeds  because it isn't just another war film, with the same old stereotypes and  conventions. It's a philosophical hammer-blow set during wartime, that  yanks you out of your Hollywood complacency and shows you something more; a  fundamentally deep and yet non-patronising world view. Its incredible  beauty and wonderful acting give you release from your day-to-day reels of  celluloid, and show you a revelatory experience.

1027011,4,6305438137,"Jones has been described as a bad writer who was a genius.  His efforts to portray war realistically while probing metaphysical matters through the lenses provided by character studies of men in an Army rifle company were  quite uneven, but taken as a whole, brilliant.

The movie captured the  best of what Jones tried to accomplish, but meandered too much.

A few  other quibbles: Jones' frank and realistic exploration of homosexuality in a military context was dropped.  The  company commander's Jewishness was dropped.  Jones pulled no punches about  attitudes toward Jews in the Army (and society) of that time, and his  Captain Stein was a more complex character whose plight was more pathetic  and sympathetic--in the novel the men first dub him ""Bugger  Stein"" and come to appreciate his good qualities only after he's  relieved.

As for the plus side of the ledger: The actors were superb.  Even Travolta and Clooney managed to contribute much to the film's tone  through their abbreviated appearances.  The cinematography was wonderful.  The depiction of combat was eerily reminescent of accounts provided by  jungle warfare veterans with whom I've had the chance to serve.

Granted... the movie is only going to be appreciated by those few individuals who are truly introspective, spiritually aware or those who  have faced the most severe kinds of adversity in their lives.  Unfortunately these characteristics are all too uncommon especially amongst  Americans.
The film is an exploration at its' core of the most  fundamental human emotions and motivations.  Courage, love, honor,  devotion, sacrifice, ambition, fear, adherence to principle, compromise,  cynicism, acceptance, hope, malice, humanity, morality, and doubt just to  name a few.  And all of these with respect to oneself and others.
All  that notwithstanding it is a brilliantly crafted film.  Fabulous imagery  and cinematography plus perfectly orchestrated music for the drama that it  accompanies.  The beauty of the music and scenery is a perfect contrast to  the horrors and harsh realities of war.  And it was designed to illustrate  just that contrast.  How can such a miraculous and beautiful creation be  brought to the level of a killer or an animal willing to do anything just  to survive?  That's the fundamental question.
Though the film is not  loaded with action, the action sequences are spectacular and capture the  chaos, fear and uncertainty that many combat situations certainly must  be.
For me this is almost a once in a lifetime film.  The last film I saw  that I felt this strongly about was the Shawshank Redemption.  In short,  this is quality work.  Not action packed, or excessively graphic but  thoroughly thought provoking and dramatic.  Mr Malick is to be highly  commended.

Because the movie is boring.  We all seem to be  missing the point.  Many people have pointed out that it the film is  unrealistic and are technically right.  But by being unrealistic in  appearance, it has become more realistic than any war movie, because it  knows that in order for us to feel it, it has to come from inside, from the  heart and the soul.  We can't use our brains in this movie, it just won't  work.  It's boring, and that's the point--the soldiers are bored, are  demoralized, and we are made to share that with them, to get that  experience.  It's useless yet inevitable to compare it with ""Saving  Private Ryan"", but let me just say that they are very different.  ""Saving Private Ryan"" 's plot is strong, the characters are  strong.  ""The Thin Red Line"" strays on and off, the climaxes come  on and off, and the characters come on and off.  There is no structure, but  that is how it's most effective.  They both work in their own way.

Most people will consider it boring, but Terrence Malick's  masterpiece (a shop-worn adjective used by all customers who reviewed this  movie, as I can see) is a brooding, fascinating, and curiously cool  experience.  The ensemble cast is excellent, and the poetry that bleeds out  of the movie never stops.  After watching this movie, I've seen war from a  totally new perspective, and I understood it even more.  The cinematography  is sweeping and heart-stopping, and the music is probably the best  soundtrack of the year.

Terrence Malick has a masterpiece here.  It is a film that will become a classic.  Like those movies that have been chastised in the past  by the same sort that are bold enough to give this film one star, Thin Red  Line will edure those slings and arrows waiting for us to catch up to its  higher standards.
Three things I would like to point out here.  One: I  originaly saw this film accompanied by a WWII vet, a man who fought in the  South Pacific.  He was awe struck and deeply moved at this films reality.  Two: Unlike the ordinary war movie, this film does not allow you to see the  enemy until the characters do.  You know they're there.  But where?  When  will they strike?  A masterful concept.  Three:  The scene towards the end  of the story whereby the soldiers are walking past the cemetary where  fallen heroes are buried is beyond description especially with the back  drop of thoughtful narration at that point.  At first I thought it an error  to show the modern day cemetary with sprinklers watering the lawns and  such.  However, showing that sacred ground with the characters of this fine  film walking by in deep reflection is an awesome sight which pays great  homage to those fallen heroes.

1027070,3,6305438137,"""The Thin Red Line"" is a weird movie. How so? On one hand you have brilliant visuals, thought-provoking musings from the characters about man's inhumanity towards man, and a terrific performance by Nick Nolte as  Lt. Colonel Tall.
On the other you have actors who are generic and bland  and blend together. (In ""Saving Private Ryan"" I knew who was  who.) The film's plot listlessly bumps from place-to-place,  character-to-character without any idea about what's going on. The movie  appears for the first ten or fifteen minutes to be about a pacifist  private, who then disappears for virtually the next two hours! He then  returns at the end and his death is the emotional finale of the movie. At  the showing I went to a person in front of me asked her husband who he was  and had to be reminded he was supposed to be the main character. Even  Writer-Director Terence Malick's brilliant philosophical musings about  life, voiced by the characters, don't work here. Who can really buy the  idea that these simple, bland guys are capable of contemplating the great  truths of the universe?
""The Thin Red Line"" is a three act  play- the troops land on the island and make their way to the hill they are  fighting for, then the battle is on, and then there is the aftermath of the  fighting. I found the middle part of the film the most interesting, and not  coincidentally because it starred because Nolte's Lt. Colonel Tall is  heavily featured in them. Nolte is brilliant in the role- loud, angry, and  passionate. Tall, who brags of reading Homer at West Point, loves war and  this is the big one!

Malick's storytelling technique is such that a clearly defined plotline/goal (a la  Saving Private Ryan's hokey story) is worthless, more than that it is  pointless. Malick seems to be saying that injecting such a momentous and  tumultous event like war with plots that movies have convinced us mirror  real life, but in fact are the farthest from it, would be an insult to art,  to film and to the lives of the men who lived it.  I forget which former  soldier's biography I read in which he admitted that war is long stretches  of boredom punctuated by fighting. Now with that in mind return to The Thin  Red Line and imagine that this is in fact exactly how war would be for a  young man like Wit (the main character), in fact for all the men.
I find  it hard to believe when people say it's interesting, but incomplete. All  the men grapple with their secret natures, with the selves they are and  those they hope to be. The movie is, of course, about the  religous/spiritual undertaking that is life and the ways that situations  like a war are sometimes necessary to remind us that our moments are  finite, our actions all important and that sacrifice and goodness are good  qualities not lost to us yet.",949104000,6,1346,4.473251028806584
1027073,5,6305438137,"Terence Malick's 'Thin Red Line' is quite possibly the finest work of cinematic art that has ever graced our screens. Indeed, it casts quite a shadow over other war movie classics like Apocalypse Now- leaving it in  it's wake. And as for 'Saving Private Ryan'...well it doesn't come close to  'TTRL'.
  Malick's direction is simply genius; utilising the tranquil  scenery to great effect whilst, at the same time, creating some of the most  breathtaking action-sequences to be put on 35mm. Editing is top-notch-  bearing in mind that Malick apparently filmed around 1,000,000 feet of  footage! And, indeed, the acting itself is remarkable. Nolte, Penn and  Chaplin are pure class as is Elias Koteas but Jim Caviezel steals the show  with his perception of the spiritual Private Witt; someone who we feel 'at  one' with throughout the film.
  The use of multi voice-overs from  numerous characters awards the picture with a great sense of dimension that  crosses the proverbial board of mixed emotions. In doing so, it also goes  against the notion of the classic Hollywood narrative; forming it's own  unique structure that one has never before witnessed on screen.
  The  170 minutes quite literally fly by. Certainly, one would be hard-pressed to  come across a finer motion picture of the 90's and, one feels, the history  of cinema.
  This epic masterpiece deserves to be placed on a par  with 'Citizen Kane' and 'The Third Man' and the very least you could do is  to invest in your very own copy and behold in the pure splendour that is  'The Thin Red Line'.  It's a difficult task describing such a film;  it really does have to be seen to be believed...very few words would do it  justice.",949104000,87,1696,4.828671328671328

Throughout the movie, they  talk about how what we were doing was wrong and how war is wrong.  As a  soldier in the US Army, I hate war but I must say that this was one war  America fought that we should have been fighting.  The aggresion we faced  needed to be oppressed and stopped before it reached our soils.  Granted, our military is now a totally volunteer military, but I seriously  doubt that even during WWII there were officers as inept as those shown in  the movie.

1027099,2,6305438137,"I wanted, more than anything, to like this movie.  I am an enormous fan of WWII movies, and after such recent films like Saving Private Ryan, I was really looking forward to this movie.  I hate to trash the movie  altogether, so I will focus on what I thought was good (with a few bad  comments thrown in):
1.  There is a brilliant film about the taking of a  particular hill during the Battle of Guadalcanal.  This film is one of the  best WWII movies I have ever seen.  However, the film I am referring to is  only the first hour and a half of The Thin Red Line.  Once the hill has  been taken by the Americans, I didn't see any need to keep watching the  film.
2.  Nick Nolte was born to play Colonel Tall.  I have long been a  fan of Nolte, and this role has got to be the crowning achievement of his  career so far.
3.  Somewhere, perhaps in an editing room, there is a  maginificent 6-hour film about the Battle of Guadalcanal.  Unfortunately,  The Thin Red Line only comprises three hours of it.  Again, I found the  last half of the film completely incoherent.
Honestly, if you want to see  a good WWII movie, watch the first 1 1/2 hours of The Thin Red Line.  Then,  leave the tape/DVD running, but feel free to go grab a bite or clean the  bathroom or something.  If you just keep coming into the room every few  minutes, you still won't miss anything from the last half.
This was once  a brilliant film.  I can only hope that the uncut version will be released  some day, because I am anxious to know how the remainder of the film fits  together.  I am sure the film editor is haunted by the cuts he had to make,  and it's too bad that a six-hour movie would never do well in  theaters--anyone ever see ""Little Dorritt""?  It was about seven  hours long--people had to go to the theater twice to see all of it, if I  remember right.

One of my top dozen favorite films, ""Thin Red"" touches your mind and heart with a spiritual view of the mankind destroying the world.  This is not an  arthouse war flick. ""Thin Red"" only seems that way because of its  comparasion to ""Ryan"".  SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is a great war film.  But I do believe it has a formula. With exception to the first & last  halfhour, Ryan lacked what ""Thin Red"" will offer.  Why are men  sent to die? Is death so terrible? the movie doesn't answer but holds these  qurestions infront of your eyes. One of the most beauiful films ever made.

1027175,1,6305438137,"Coming out at the same time as ""Saving Private Ryan"" and having top notch stars like Nick Nolte and Sean Penn I highly anticipated watching this movie.
Finally having seen it on home video  and watching it twice,  I can tell you ""It's a snoozer"". I only watched it twice because  I could not believe it was so bad on the first viewing.
The dominant  theme of this movie seems to be war is full of psychotics. Nick Nolte is a  psychotic, ambitious officer, and the Japanese opponents are all psychotics  lost in a Buddhist Zen trance who can't fight because they are all sitting  around crosslegged in loin cloths chanting ""Om..""
I find the  film insulting to both the Japanese, and to American veterans who faced the  Japanese Empire at its height in the beginning of WWII and defeated them  soundly, but not without a lot of hard fighting and sacrifice.  Watching  this movie makes you wonder why we didn't win in a day or two  and with one  hand tied behind our backs.  The Japanese are portrayed as having less  military skills than Saddam Hussein, and as a crying bunch of sobbing wimps  and whiners. In the film, the Japanese panic, have emotional breakdowns at  the slightest confrontation Americans, and readily surrender. In real life,  they fanatically fought until the end and committed suicide rather than  surrender.
The battle scenes are not very realistic. Whoever was the  military consultant on this film obviously felt the Japanese did not have  the military competency to fight their way out of a sandbox, which even  casual historians of Guadacanal would tell you is not true.
After the  ""climatic"" battle scene in the middle of the film, which  basically shows the Japanese as having no tactical skill at all, (for  example, their machine guns are set up to shoot pointblank into their own  camp) the film degrades into an hour of philosophical mumblings by Sean  Penn. It's great if you have trouble otherwise falling asleep.
Basically  the film is not entertaining. It was not well crafted. Instead of reaching  into the depths of your soul to encourage you to answer some eternal  philosophical dichotomies, which I assume was their intent,  the only  eternal question is ""Why did I waste my time and money""?",947721600,8,2231,4.771653543307087
1027176,2,6305438137,"I've only seen this movie once, so maybe, just maybe it gets better with multiple viewings.
First the good:  excellent cinematography and a couple of riveting battle scenes.
Now the bad: The plot, if you can call it  that, involves an US Army company going into Guadalcanal, fighting a couple  of firefights, getting shot up, securing the island, then finally getting  relieved and pulled out.  All the while the characters have highly  philosophical thoughts presented to the audience via voice-overs.  There is  really no plot as one scene shifts to another and ""events  happen.""
Ok, I've seen and enjoyed Apocalypse Now and highly  recommend that movie in place of the Thin Red Line.  Why TRL fails even in  the philosophic/artistic front vs Apocalypse Now is that it doesn't bring  to closure any of the philosophical thoughts it presents.  I think the  movie attempts to present too many different ideas from ""war is  futile"", ""playing a role"", to ""love vs hate"" to  really do a good job with any one of them.
If I were to rate the movie  alone I may have given it 3 stars out of 5 but the DVD treatment falls far  short of it's potential.  True, the audio and visuals are stunning, the  scene selection feature is nicely done, and it includes standards such as  widescreen and alternate language(Spanish) subtitles.  Where it fall short,  however, is the ""bonus material.""  Included on the DVD is not  director's or background material to help you understand the point of the  movie.  No background info on the battles of the Pacific Islands of WWII or  even the actors can be found here either.  What's included is 12 tracks of  Melanesian Songs.  That's right!  Granted these songs add to the atmosphere  of the movie as part of the soundtrack, but a whole CD of them!  I got to  the third track trying to give it a fair shake before I couldn't take the  shrilling anymore!  I guess they really cut a CD as it's pictured on screen  while the ""music"" is playing.  Is this somebody's sick marketing  idea for this movie?  For excellent examples of DVD bonus features I highly  recommend Casablanca, Saving Private Ryan, and The Right Stuff.
In  summary:  good artistic approach in videos and audios, no plot, fails to  play out philosophical ideas, lame DVD bonus material (2 out of 5 stars).",947635200,5,2298,4.718274111675127

Traditional movies are constructed around the narrative with the visuals and sound effects employed to highten the emotional ties to the plot.  Whatever else, the  narrative must come first  This movie is ALL about the image with  everything else a distant second.
Whereas Saving Private Ryan may be  like a great novel, this movie is like a great painting.  For those of you  who know it, think of the giant Gaugain that hangs in the MFA in Boston.  Because of this, it is MUCH more work for the viewer and is about what the  viewer brings to the viewing almost as much as what is actually shown.

1027178,5,6305438137,"I have to admit that I disliked this film initially.  It certianly isn't for every taste, and it's sheer torture to sit through if you're in a restless mood.  That said, if you ARE in the right mood, it's absolutely  incredible.  This was my second favorite movie of 1998, and would have been  a shoo-in for first in almost any other year.

Perhaps the big turn-off  for many was this film's unconventionality.  I'd be hard-pressed to compare  it to any other film that I've seen - it is very, very artsy, incredibly  slow - and amazingly, it works beautifully.

On my second viewing, I  realized that the film follows the Three Act structure (I didn't think it  had any sort of structure at all when I first saw it).  The first act  serves to set up the characters - sort of.  It exists even moreso to set a  mood of tension and restlesness, and perhaps even feelings of boredom.  And  then it is shattered by the intense violence of the second (which  encompasses most of the movie).  The majority of the film is one extended  battle scene, intercut with brief flashbacks and voice-overs.  The artsier  elements do not detract from the action, but add to it - they succeed in  briefly letting the viewer peek into the minds of the soldiers, only to be  suddenly yanked back into reality when the battle resumes.

The battle  scenes are amazing (second only to ""Saving Private Ryan"" in my  opinion).  They're brutal, horrifying, and at times beautiful due to the  amazing cinematography.  The second act is as immersive, brilliant, and  haunting as any film that I have ever seen.

The only problems come  during the first and third acts.  Malick takes a little too long to get the  film started.  Although the initial scenes - which consist of two soldiers'  experiencing a near-eden-like paradise while going AWOL, and the  preperations for battle - are effective and necessary, hints of  pretentiousness sink in.  The film is just a tad too artsy near the  beginning, and a lot of people that disliked the movie probably gave up on  it because of this.

The final act is effective at winding the film  down, but the problems from the first persist - it's a bit too long, and  comes over as pretentious at times.  That said, there are two sequences  (one where a soldier gets a devastating note from his wife, and another  where one of the main characters is killed) that are nothing short of  incredible.

The performances are phenominal all around.  The two  standouts are Nick Nolte and newcomer Jim Caviezel, both of whom should  have been nominated for Oscars.  Nolte is riveting and intense as the  colonel in charge of the operation.  His character is hard, mean, and  somewhat reckless with the lives of his men, and yet Nolte somehow manages  to evoke sympathy for him.  Caviezel is forever questioning the nature of  war, his place in it, and if there's any deeper meaning to the hell that  he's going through.  He is absolutely perfect - genuine, sympathetic,  sincere, and yet strong when he needs to be.  Although restricted to a  relatively small role, Sean Penn is also very good as the company's  pessimistic seargent.

As to how it stacks up to ""Saving Private  Ryan"" - it was my second favorite movie of 1998, ""Ryan"" was  my first.  It's really hard to compare the two - they are so, so different  - so I won't, beyond saying that Spielberg's film had more of an impact on  me.  However, the two are comparable from the standpoint of quality (I can  easily see why someone would ""The Thin Red Line"" above  ""Ryan). I highly recommend both of them, and consider them to be the  two best war movies ever made.
All in all, ""The Thin Red Line""  is filmmaking of an incredibly high order.  It's slight faults are easily  offset by the sheer brilliance of what is done right.  It's a real shame  that it tanked at the box office - films this unconventional, powerful, and  thought-provoking don't come along very often.",947548800,10,3933,4.612244897959184
1027179,5,6305438137,"This film is not like any other war film I have witnessed. It is not an action war movie as for the most part it tends to abstract the enemy, but I certainly didn't find myself bored either. I think the lack of action is  intentional. It is not film that really wants to focus on the pain and  suffering of the body, it wants you to sit back and contemplate what  exactly the war meant for the characters we meet and possibly for us too. I  think the lack of very well known actors in the main parts helps us believe  we are getting to know these people. (I also think the cameo roles are a  bit annoying).
The film has been criticised for being a bit pretentious  on Malicks part and this argument is not completely unfounded, but I tend  to go for style in my films anyway (like Leon by Luke Besson for example)  so I found the shots of the grass blowing and the sun shining through the  trees quite enthralling.
A film which has a similar premise is probably  Apocalypse Now by Francis Ford Coppola (did I spell that right?), except  the thin red line has a better ending, so if you saw and liked this one I  would recommend you see that.
Well I hope this review has helped you a  bit. One thing I would definately recommend is that you see this film  before you ever consider buying it.",947548800,4,1290,4.186991869918699
1027180,5,6305438137,"I was first in line to see this film last year when it opened in theatres.  I had loved the book, loved the director, and loved the cast.  I didn't know what to make of the film.  I originally found it slow, ponderous, and  nothing at all like the book that had kept me riveted for 600 pages.  I  thought the cinematography was terrific and some of the performances  (notably Elias Koteas and Ben Chaplin) were excellent.  But on the whole I  was disappointed.
Then about two weeks later I went to see the film  again.  On the second viewing, I was taken in. The battle scenes were  exciting and the visuals struck me as absolutely beautiful.  But still, I  was hesitant to give the film a glowing recommendation.
I asked for the  widescreen edition of the video for Christmas because the more I thought  about the film, the better I liked it.  Finally the other night I watched  it for a third time...it's one of the greatest films I've ever seen and  certainly one of the best films of the past decade. The cinematography, the  battle scenes, the performances, the score, everything came together in a  riveting three hours.  I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I found  myself awestruck, wondering how Terrence Malick could have choreographed  some of the battle scenes.  The canvas he paints is so large and so  vivid.
Some highlights: Elias Koteas as Staros, the captain with a  conscience; Ben Chaplin, the young private who daydreams of his wife back  home; the assault on the Japanese hilltop bunker; Woody Harrelson's  ""big"" scene; the attack in the fog; the shot of the soldier  crying in hysterics in the rain...I could on.
I do think Nick Nolte is a  little over the top and I have a difficult time understanding everything he  says, and George Clooney's cameo appearance seems a little unnecessary  though I understand Malick originally shot about six hours of film and a  lot of performances ended on the cutting room floor.

After the Marines have finished their operation on the island, the story begins with the landing of a US Army force to take over.  The film mostly  revolves around several select characters, inter-mixed with brief appearances by others.  This film is similiar to Malick's previous works, Days of Heaven and Badlands, where there are voice tracks of the character's thoughts as they progress through events.  The movie spends a lot of time  developing several key characters in an infantry company; a young soldier labeled as a non-team player, a battle-wise first sergeant, a company  commander who stands up against his battalion commander during an attack that is causing high losses, and the battalion commander whose personal ambitions over-ride his soldiers' welfare.  The film is good, but can be depressing and appear to drag with the character's thoughts and dreams, but it does approach what life must have been like for the soldiers serving during war; long periods of boredom and depression, broken by short bursts of terrifying combat.  The film is much different from Saving Private Ryan, but unfortunately receives a lot of critical  comparison because it was released shortly afterward.  Good film, Nick Nolte is excellent as a battalion commander and John Cusak does a  brief appearance in a tense battle to seize a hilltop.

Many think it is about guns, artillary, and good old fashioned patriotism.  This movie is about a different war- the inner war.  This beautiful canvas  full of poetic beauty and sensual mindflow, is one not to be taken  superficially by the viewer, which has lead to a great misunderstanding of  this masterpiece.  It needs not to be watched on a war movie frame-of-mind,  but needs to be experienced like a favorite piece of classical music (if  you like classical music).  The setting for this movie is stunning although  should not be the center piece.  The battle scenes are excellent (the  taking of the hill), and the cinematics wonderous; backed by a disturbing  (sometimes menacing) perfect musical score.  The film seems to wander  fluidly much like the human mind, and the train of thought unfolding is  underappreciated.  Fans of strait-forward action may be disappointed.  Best  advice is to rent the movie before viewing, that way there will be no harsh  reviews of people who hated this movie.  I believe this film would be more  appreciated by the art crowd.  The art crowd should not be distracted by  its premise or its big name actors.  The cast in this picture are supurb  and complement Malicks haunting direction without overshadowing it.  The  unsettling nature of this movie is sure to invoke the same in the viewer.  Remember only great movies stir such extreme emotions from viewers.  A  movie either loved or hated.  This movie should be given a chance or even a  second chance.  email me At  ---------->  mhanlen@mtnhome.com",946857600,4,1697,4.862190812720848

Malick follows a simple formula of showing an action shot, then a nature shot, then a  psychological shot, and finally back to an action shot. The so called  poetic images are forced down your throat. I guess Malick thought we were  all too stupid to get his psuedo philosophy about war. Every actor in this  is wasting his time ( especially Sean Penn ). All the characters sound the  same and there is no distinction between them. The script is terrible as  well. My favorite line ( which is used more than 10 times I believe ) has  some character saying "" my soul hurts "" . Ha! Ha! Are you done  laughing? I've got another one. "" Why am I here ? "", or check out  "" why am I killing these people ? "" Oh boy, this is definately  the best comedy of all time!  If you want a war film that is poetic and not  cheap, watch Apocalypse Now.

Strange, but unlike Saving Private Ryan which left  me with some indelible scenes, this movie has left me with a feeling and  pictures of the sky!

Spielberg couldn't touch this  movie.  It is a far more sophisticated film than the ultra-commercial  Saving Private Ryan.  SVP is a great entertaining film to watch once and  then forget - its sentimentality and simplistic characterizations are  enjoyable the first time they're shoved down your throat.  But a second  viewing reveal the film 's hollow center.  Thin Red Line on the other hand  is quietly disturbing.

1027286,2,6305438137,"This is a potentially fine film completely ruined by force-fed intellectualism and miles of excessive footage best left on the cutting room floor. The closing shot is such a simple yet elegantly powerful image,  that it should have left audiences in awed silence. Instead, it left them  grumbling and wanting their money back. The message had already been  bludgeoned to death over and over during the ponderous course of this  movie. War is a crime against nature...we get it already!
Other flaws  include the completely ridiculous and totally unnecessary philosophical  narration, the loose ends in the story that are never resolved, and the  raised expectations that are never satisfied. Mallick expertly sets us up  for what promises to be great movie moments and then he doesn't deliver. To  be fair, this tactic works in some instances. For example, the suspense  leading up to the beach landing scene makes the viewer expect to soon see  bullets, bombs and body parts flying (a la Pvt. Ryan). Instead, the troops  are greeted with a malignant silence and the dread feeling of being sucked  into a trap. To me, this was just as unnerving as a horrific battle scene  and, respectfully, I had to concede that the filmmaker had me right where  he wanted me.  However, as the film trudges on, we are confronted with more  of these build-ups, with no pay-off, and start to feel as if we're being  had. I couldn't help but think that Mallick took some perverse pleasure in  doing this. Perhaps it was the artsy thing to do.
Anyway, a lot of people  did like this movie so please go and judge for yourself.  If you do decide  to watch it, I'd like to offer a few viewing tips to make your experience  more rewarding:
1. Do NOT fast forward any scene containing Nick Nolte.  He is amazing. 2. DO fast forward any scene containing jungle bats, lizards  and other tropical creatures. Nothing happens to them. 3. Prepare to hit  the MUTE button anytime you hear narration. Un-MUTE periodically to see if  it is safe to listen again. 4. Do NOT convince anyone to watch this with  you because George Clooney is in it. This is a BIG mistake.",945820800,12,2133,4.691891891891892

1027288,1,6305438137,"This is a film that fails on almost every level.
As an adaptation of a novel it misses all the major themes expressed by James Jones, relocating the ""action"" to an historical battlefield (Guadalcanal) where  Jones had left it specifically ambiguous. As a war film, there is little of  the feel of war; the combat scenes are orthodox, there is little shock (to  either viewer or the combatants) and the combat seems to take place in a  pristinely maintained nature reserve - Guadalcanal was a mosquito infested  swamp with the highest rate of malarial infection of any place in the  Pacific theatre. As an exercise in myth-making, it fails to provide a  central character whose journey can enlighten us - we are instead subjected  to a constant barrage of disingenuous voice overs, mock clever images and  mundane editing. As a philosophical journey, it expresses nothing beyond  teenage existentialism which it seeks to bolster with bombastic use of  cinematography.
Someone (more witty than I) once said ""Mallick never  saw a tree he didn't love"". This is no more aptly displayed than in  his clumsy attempts at juxtaposition between the beauty of north Queensland  (whoops that's meant to be Guadalcanal isn't it) and the ferocity of the  war it inadequately attempts to portray. Or is it a device to frame the  natural element of war within the natural environment? Or is it to contrast  the timelessness of nature with the ephemera of mankind? Who knows? And  frankly, who cares?
Within the film we are supposedly transported into  the heads of the GIs on the ground. Apparently they are 1st year philosophy  students who spend the whole time soliloquising(?) in a fashion that would  have Baudrillard and Lyotard polevaulting all around the cinema. The fact  that most GIs were average guys from farms and factories and from an era  that predates the whole postmodernist movement is blithely ignored. Instead  we are subjected to an interminable drone of voice-over, with little or no  differentiation between the characters to help you build any framework in  which to place them. The voice-overs merely become an irritating part of  the soundtrack. Can you quote one significant line from the film that  encapsulates its themes and relate the context in which it was delivered? I  didn't think so.
The supposed main character Whit wanders the battlefield  in a state of almost perpetual ecstacy, searching for that Zen moment  whereby he resolve his life in a perfect death. Are we supposed to care  about people like this? The idea that we should welcome war and violent  death as a mechanism to achieve some form transcendance I find ludicrous at  best and morally bankrupt in the extreme. This sort of thinking led to the  corruption of Bushido into a death cult that found its final form in the  Rape of Nanking, the Burma-Thailand railway and the mass suicides on  Okinawa.
Nick Nolte is, as usual, superb, as are many of the other  performances. But good performances on their own do not a great movie make.  Great movies also require, at least, a plot of consequence, depth of  character, reasonable pacing, more than functional editing, interesting  dialogue and some form of motivation to explain something (anything).
In  all this The Thin Red Line fails. This movie ambitiously attempts  mythmaking for the 20th century, but succeeds only in presenting a formless  mishmash of images and meaningless platitudes contained within a poorly  edited and badly scripted shell of cinematographic masturbation. In trying  so hard to  be ""significant"" and ""deep"" this film is  merely irrelevant and shallow.",945648000,21,3616,5.018549747048904

""The Thin Red Line"" starts out as a  seemingly boring movie. The beginning is beautiful, very pretty scenery...  much different then ""Saving Private Ryan"". Slowly, but surely  (and definitely artistically), the movie creeps towards the battles of  Guadacanal.
The majority of the movie is based in the hills of  Guadacanal... and the cinematography is some of the best, in any movie  ever... period. There are shots that are 1/2 a mile wide, and there are  soldiers in the whole shot. What little action there is is great. Almost  ""Braveheart-like"" at times, it really gets the adrenaline (and  suspense) flowing. The movie really shines in the acting and the general  intelligence of the story. The movie seems to be fragmented between many  different characters, but by the end, the stories are completed and you are  left with a different emotion for each different part. Nick Nolte and Sean  Penn are absolutely amazing in this film, and Woody Harrelson really shows  his stuff during a certain death scene. ""The Thin Red"" line seems  long, and it is... 2 hours and 45 minutes.

1027363,3,6305438137,"Boasting an ensemble cast including veteran Nick Nolte, Sean Penn and John Travolta (in a minor role) to name a few, The thin red line endeavours to portray yet another rendition of the gritty reality of war.
Set in the  second world war it deals with a group of American soldiers whose mission  it is to win a sub-war in the South Pacific, their first front being the  jungles of Malaysia where they must be prepared for the distress of futile  human sacrifice - in  so doing they must also be prepared for the imminence  of their own death or maiming.
Sean Penn plays his usual cockiness well;  however his role doesn't ever allow him to display the criminal roguishness  at which he truly excels, for example the character Meserve portrayed in  the Vietnam flick Casualties of War.  Incidentally two other thin red line  cast members also appeared in the above film (John C. Reilly and Don  Harvey).
Nick Nolte's gravelly voice gives credibility to his  authoritarian role - Furthermore the portrayal of his disaffected,  uncompromising Lt. Col. Tall are well realised.
Adrien Brody adds a touch  of peacefulness and melancholy as Corporal Fife.
Overall this is a well  balanced cast whose solid teamwork effectively conveys the mood of the  collective war experience.

Unlike the blatently obvious and artificial Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line delivers insight into  human existance through its visuals and steam of consciousness dialogue.  The characters, such as Nolte and Caviezel, give a true feeling of what  it's like to go through the trials of war. Their constant questioning of  nature and there right to invade a foreign world go hand in hand with the  contradictions of war and the question of whether or not we as humans have  the right to kill, even in war time. Mallick delivers one of the most  asthetically pleasing films I've ever seen. The visuals are gorgeous in  their picture of a place untouched by the quest for power presented in war.  On the flip side they are also hideously ugly in their depiction of a land  being envaded by Americans, who treat their enemies as if they were nothing  more than animals.

They are two vastly different kinds of films that happened to come out in succession. For me TRL, is a far more rewarding picture. Like all great works, it requires multiple viewings and close attention to be fully appreciated. This is not an action picture in any sense of the term. Yes, there are battle scenes (one spectacular battle in particular, for the taking of a hill) The director, Terence Malick, uses the wartime setting to make points about the human condition (especially, humans as PART of the NATURAL WORLD), because war intensifies and foregrounds the most fundamental emotions. A major aspect of the film, often neglected in reviews, is the theme of the dualities of existence and how they may never be reconciled in the human mind: war/peace; nature/civilization; life/death; individual/group.
The film (derived loosely from the James Jones novel) is Whitmanesque in seeing mankind as a part of nature--to the basic state of which he must return someday--and in a need for each individual to see himself in others and as part of a greater whole. A magnificently photographed and well-acted, haunting film, TRL demands close attention and more than one viewing. For some, it will be well worth the effort.

1027473,5,6305438137,"Not since ""The English Patient"" had one film affirmed for me how a remarkable film experience can sometimes become one of the most elevated forms of expression people can make. ""The Thin Red Line""  transports us to an otherworldly, savagely beautiful place, and we are left  to grapple with the ugliness people are perfectly capable of engendering.  It was only after seeing Malick's characters painfully contend with their  own modernity that I could ever hope to even understand the historical  forces that could transform the unspoilt fastness of Guadalcanal-whose  indigenous people have never so much as seen outsiders prior to 1942-could  quite suddenly become a graveyard. All told, tens of thousands of  Americans, Australians, over half a million Japanese (to say nothing of the  Melansians!) would die in the Solomon Islands & New Guinea.
What's  even more surprising is that Malick leaves us very little room to pass any  judgement of guilt on anyone. To paraphrase Jean Renoir, No one is truly  villainous as every one has his or her own reasons. Setting the soldiers'  private battles within a very public cataclysm that is as much their very  own making as it is beyond their control, it is as if Malick wanted to show  that Man's expulsion from Paradise only resulted in an innate, retributive  urge to destroy other Edens---and himself in the process. One particularly  haunting voiceover in the film pleads that ""if I never meet you, may I feel  the lack."" Testifying to the fact that war is indeed the worst place to be  a human being, and yet the only true place to recognize one's humanity, he  makes us acutely feel the enormity of that loss in all its possible  implications. Talk about an existential crisis!
To reduce ""Thin  Red Line"" in terms of a simple war movie, or even an anti-war movie so  you could set it against the moral simplicity of ""Saving Private  Ryan"" is missing the point. Whereas all the flag-waving and the  willful misuse of the of all the Civil War quotations in ""Private  Ryan"" confirm Spielberg's intention that his war movie be identified a  as a purely American parable, the ""Thin Red Line's"" great ambition was  that it hoped to address an even larger polity. Scenes like the one where  wild dogs feast on the corpses of American dead, or the lingering shot of a  of bloodied hatchling shaken from its nest, or the one where a tribesman  politely ignores an army column, or the that final scene where a solitary,  germinating coconut witnesses the troops disembarking for another death  trap are visually inventive as they are telling. With nature and the  inescapable cycles of death and rebirth as his proxies, Malick urges us to  not impressed by our own self-importance.
On one final cavil, I wonder  why some people can still think that poetry, literal and cinematic, is  exclusively the province of the haughty when Malick shows us (as he did in  his previous work) that poems can be as accessible, relevant and as clear a  vision of where we are and where we could be. Spielberg knew about poems  once, and the complexity and the comparably rich palette he afforded us in  the unheralded ""Empire of the Sun,"" is one that all of Janus'  Kaminsky's spectacular camerawork in ""Private Ryan"" or even  ""Shindler's List"" could never hope to recreate. The latter two  films have at least proven that even with raw talent, cautionary fables  (however harrowing)and agitprop are much easier to come by. Art is  altogether different and is therefore uncommon: if it weren't for something  as elusive as a genuine creative vision aren't all movies then just lengths  of exposed film and magnetically-encoded sound?",943920000,14,3661,4.876422764227642

SPR was a sentimental story of heroism, with evil Germans and noble  Americans.  The Thin Red Line is a prolonged meditation on the nature of  evil, and long after the facile dichotomies of SPR are exposed the issues  of this film will remain.
In that sense, this is not a war movie.  Do not  expect a fast pace throughout. There are battle scenes and realistic gore,  but the film is about who we are and why we fight, how we can find and be  so barbaric in a world of such great natural beauty.
The cinematography,  which includes gorgeous shot after gorgeous shot, is outstanding.  Worth  watching with the volume off.",943920000,6,772,4.6716417910447765
1027475,3,6305438137,"I did not want to write anything about ""Saving Private Ryan"" here, but many comments force me to. The film is not nearly as simplistic as some Malick-buffs want it to be. In fact, it is far more subtle than  this one, because all the situations remain uncommented (the superflous  framing device notwithstanding). In TRL, Malick includes many unfortunate  voice-overs, which do not sound like soldiers in comebat but like the last  survivor of Woodstock. Don't get me wrong. TRL is a good film. The  cinematography is extraordinary, as is the acting and Hans Zimmers score.  But there is no doubt that it is also pretentious and mannered, though I  would not go so far to call it self-indulgent. I must also say that  Malick's film is too disjointed, particularly the last 45 minutes. I'm sure  this was deliberate, but any film (or book) needs at least a slight bit of  coherence. I do not say this because I did not get the message of TRL. The  point is not wether you are smart enough or not. It is just the fact that  this approach makes the film too arbitrary.  The bottom line is that SPR is  more meaningful than it seems at first sight. With TRL it is just vice  versa. A philosophical, non-coherent approach does not automatically make a  film sophisticated. Many statements in TRL are awfully simplistic. It is  not even very poetic, because it strives too hard to be just that. It is a  brilliantly filmed, but otherwise flawed film. Still a picture, that no  serious moviegoer can afford to ignore.

I hated the fact that people were trying to compare it to my favorite movie at the time, Saving Private Ryan, I couldn't believe that any movie would ever  surpass it, but I was wrong.  Althought both movies are great, you really  can't compare them.  This movie is very different.  It has a really good  cast, with many talented actors.  The plot is well written, and the beauty  of the cinematography is unsurpassed, but the reason that I love about it,  is the script.  It is very poetic, and very surreal.  It is more about a  man's thoughts about life, and the nature of war.  It was really a moving  experience, and I love it for what it is.  Unlike Saving Private Ryan, this  movie has no agenda, it is a simple story of one man's struggle in all the  madness of war, and how he finds beauty in such an awful setting.  It is  truly a classic war film, with not alot of violence, but with alot of  emotion, and it leaves you thinking about the true nature of man and  humanity, and how war effects us!",943833600,5,1074,4.207920792079208

It doesn't  matter who you are , in a war all are innocent like a child. There is nor  heroes neither enemies, all are human beings. Despite its casual monotony  for its 172 minutes, it is a touching life lesson in a war between life and  death.

The film is riveting and  totally coherent from the hunting crocodile in the opening scene, to the  predacious leaf that closes upon its victim, to the rapacious character of  Col. Tall.  The story line is knit together from the very begining by the  running conversation between Witt and Sergeant Welsh.  Just follow that and  ask yourself why Witt sacrificed himself.  In the midst of the carnage of  human existence we either cross the thin red line into madness, find  Welsh's island of numbing isolation, or make Witt's sacrifice.  Ultimately  the film is about the fatal flaw in Creation, human self-awareness.  Director Malick leaves us with the men who survived because of Witt's  sacrifice and with these accusatory words on God's horrors, ""Oh my  soul be in me now, look out of my eyes, look out at all the things you  made, all things shining.""",943315200,14,1114,4.768421052631579

No-one can tell you what  this film is like and lets all be honest regardless of the side of the  fence you are on -- How many times have you read a review that was bad,  went to see the film and LOVED it!  This is one of these films...you will  either love it or hate it..personally i think it is one of the most  powerful movies i have ever watched (along with cross of iron, incidently)  but some of my friends think it is a load of (enter any expletive you like  here--they have).  However you feel about this film, i would ask you to  ponder this difficult question which the film raises :
who is the  braver,
the colonel who is prepared to expend his men's lives and at any  cost in the persuit of a greater goal  or the captain who refuses because  the cost is too much on his men and wants a different solution?
difficult  isn't it....
This film is like this awful emotional question and you --  will either love it or hate it, and you will have to decide on the answers.  we don't have any Ramboesque solutions here....
With regards to the DVD  version of the film-- i think it is really well presented and has some  music extras which i enjoyed.  My advice, RENT IT and THEN BUY IT...or even  better see it in the movies if you can because a few years from now -- at a  dinner somewhere with someone you want to impress, you will be able to say  'actually i saw that movie on its first release.....'.

I was amazed by his ability to hew closely to the plot line of the book, but suppress most of  its virtues.  In place of James Jones' sharp characterizations and  down-to-earth realism, Malick imposes pompous philosophizing that makes  almost everyone seem the same.  This dreary sameness makes the last 45  minutes of the movie quite dull.  Excellent performances by Nick Nolte,  Sean Penn, and Elias Koteas inject a degree of individuality to their  characters, but they seem to succeed in spite of Malick's efforts to  advance his ethereal message that war is unnatural.  He errs most  spectacularly in deviating from the book to hammer this silly point home by  showing two AWOL soliers going AWOL in an idyllic Polynesian village.  These scenes manage to be hackneyed, implausible, and condescending all at  once.
Even so, there's no denying that this is a beautiful movie, which  is responsible for one of my stars.  But the book was a much more rewarding  experience.",942796800,,1100,4.912568306010929

Aside from several great sequences in the film (not all of them where action sequences), the film dragged its feet. There was at most 2 hours of  redeemable film stretched out to 3 hours. Malick has a vision in this film,  almost ""Apocalypse Now"" like vision, showing the motivation  behind each character. That part is not the problem, telling the emotional  and mental pain soldiers go through while at war is a wonderful goal.  Unfortunatly that goal is not met in this film. One of the problems is  Malick tried to do this with too many characters. At times, I had no idea  which charatcer was narrarating. The short scene with John Cusack is the  most exhilarating scene in this film and the best one I've seen in quite  awhile.  Overall its a good film if you want to study human behavior in  time of war, but not if you want a war film.

Every time I would get the tiniest bit  interested in what was going on, there would be a flashback to Sometown,  USA, and I had no idea where that was and I could only guess who the people  were.  I guess that I might not be the best person to criticize this  because I walked out after almost two hours of total boredom, but then  maybe that makes me the perfect critic.

It did not have the same impact on me  as did SPR, but it is definitely in the same league.
It saddens me to  know by the other reviews that people have reduced war to guns, bombs,  tanks, and planes.

I liken this film to Apocalypse Now, my favorite  film of all time, in that it is a surreal examination of the psyche.  I  feel that many of the reviewers that gush over this film do so as an  attempt to establish themselves as 'lofty"" and ""discerning of  taste"" while bashing a great film like Saving Private Ryan.  I view  these people as types who rave about Merchant Ivory period dramas and wear  this love like as badge of distinction and taste, yet wouldn't watch a  foreign film because "" I don't like to read.""  Mallick is  considered an artist, since he has made exactly 3 movies in 25 years.  Spielberg is labelled a pop culture craftsman with no subtlety and a  tendency to over sentimentalize.

Rather, it is likely that  Mallick's sketchy character development, and attempt to cram an extensive  psychological novel into a 3 hour Hollywood product is what led me to give  his movie only 2 stars.
Do yourself a favor and READ THE BOOK!
In my  opinion, though the scenery is indeed beautiful, this movie is dull where  it should be provoking (mentally, I mean), and devoid of emotion in scenes  where Mallick tries desperately to tell us ""look, look, there is  emotion in this scene, solely because someone is commenting on war in a  field of grass.""  There is no emotion, no attachment to the  characters, no meaning, because we don't care about the characters.  They  are underdeveloped; this worked to an extent in Jones' novel, because you  can ""get into a character's head"" in a novel - unfortunately,  that's rarely possible in a movie, and especially not this one, where  Mallick attempts to do it with seemingly the whole cast, and ends up  developing nobody.
In addition to these negatives are, of course, the 2  almost insulting performances of John Travolta, so miscast it was  laughable, and George Clooney, whose late, out-of-place cameo saps whatever  ounce of reality this marathon film had left in it.
Pluses include nice  scenery, chants, and some great battle scenes (especially the storming of  the pillboxes led by John Cusack, and the overrunning of the Japanese  bivouac).",941760000,3,1583,4.935361216730038

In short, it's a movie about humanity caught in the antithesis of war in a quite paradisiac environment.  Think of National Geographic in, well, Bosnia at its worst, for example.  People who perceive this movie as a waste of good actors simply don't get  it at all: this is not a movie about actors ( la Hollywood 95% of the  time) but rather perfectly exemplifies the disconnectedness of people as  they are forced into a batallion for a little while, wondering, by the end,  ""Who are you? Who is it that I fought with?"" Having watched  Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line in the same evening on DVD, I  finished the former feeling... well, not feeling much at all, to tell the  unforetunate truth. Don't get me wrong: SPR is a stunning achievement -  technically-speaking, and I recommend it to everyone. But then came this  phantasmagorical cicrus of a movie that is TRL, which compels you to think  - yes, to THINK! - not only about what one has seen, but also about the  correlation of form and content. SPR is a movie whose purpose is the war  itself; TRL, on the other hand, is a movie whose context is war but whose  subject is something else altogether.

However, most negative criticism of this film comes from people who obviously have expectations of what a film should be and demand a film to  conform to those expections. That's not necessarily a bad thing in and of  itself. Yet Malick turns the tables on the audience with his adaption of  Jones' novel. Rather than playing to the average moviegoer's expectations,  as Spielberg did admittingly with Saving Private Ryan, or rehashing the  brillant work of James Jones, Malick gives us a very demanding film that  builds from a highly personal interpretation of the themes of the original  novel into a creation that, while inevitably indebted to Jones's original  work, is is something onto itself. And as an unexpected twist to all this  movie seeks to accomplish, Malick, despite his detractors, takes to the  task in a strikingly humble way, allowing the viewer to easily choose from  him or herself to ""take or leave' what Malick offers.
Malick does  bring to the screen much of Jones' novel: humanity seemingly lost admist  war, seen through a collage of individuals--each one wandering as solitary  within the greater theater of army and warfare. As with Jones' novels, both  this one and From Here to Eternity, this is not simply an extracting  psychological expedition, but a roughly honest, unblinking look at the core  of the whole--the ""spark,"" as Albert Schweizter called it--of  each individual. Gazing into human souls without the buffer of  sentimentality never makes for comfortable entertainment, and following  Jones' lead, Malick likewise does not apologize for what he throws into the  audience's lap. While Malick may have taken liberties with plot and  character details, he does prove himself to be a faithful student of Jones  in exercising the very qualities that made Jones the powerful and effective  artist that he was.
Watching this movie will demand attention and  patience, and Malick will expect us not to be sqeamish or dull about the  difficult spiritual, moral and philosophical questions that the human race  has wrestled with since our earliest beginnings. The film carries out at a  steady, slow pace, as though it is more a meditation than a movie, and  seems to ask time and time again: With such beauty within and without us,  why do we commit such horror upon ourselves? In a movie that seeks to show  us humanity, that is perhaps one of the most enduring, most confounding,  and most human of questions. Malick's only answer, a meek and simple  one--too meek and simple for many a shallow critic--is too cling to the  remenants of that beauty and to the memory of beauty which has past away.  It is an answer that is found, Malick reveals to us, in the deepest of our  human motivations and longings, and from it springs the quiet, gentle hope  that, as the Russian genius Dostoesky phrased it, ""beauty will save  the world.""",941673600,4,2937,4.916326530612245

This movis  has almost NOTHING to do with James Jones (himself a combat veteran and  much of his book was based on his WW2 experiences) classic war novel.  I  don't care what kind of crap Malik feels he needs to put on the screen, he  shouldn't be allowed to insult a great work like The Thin Red Line.
First off, when Malik's troops hit combat we could care less what  happens to them, we don't know them.  Sean Penn would have been a good pick  for the first sergeant in an accurate portrayal, but Malik turns him, from  the alchoholic, sadistic character in the novel into some sort of milktoast  goofball.  In the book there was no deserter paddling and frolicking  amongst the natives and god's creatures.
Malik's combat scenes were  disgusting, he couldn't decide if he was Sam Peckinpah or someone doing  another Vietnam war movie, ie: the ridiculous village burning scene, it  wasn't in the book and wouldn't have occured in WW2.  Not to mention all  the executions of surrendering Japanese.
I really looked forward to this  movie and was completely appalled by it when I saw it.

Terrence Malicktook a big chance and he succeeded. If  you are looking for a conventional, yet very good Hollywood war movie, then  see ""Saving Private Ryan"". It's a pity both war movies were released so  close to each other in time. Both deserve an Oscar for best picture.  Fortunately, this is not a flag waving piece of Hollywood Americana. I  don't think Terrence Malick intended to pay homage to the US Army for  saving the world from the Japanese. This movie is about the futility and  horror of war. When you see the Japanese soldiers holding their dead  comrades in their arms and sobbing like a child you realize that they are  just as human and confused as the Americans. War makes all men brutal and  equal. It is only the generals and *** kissing officers -except for Capt.  Stanos-who are interested in Purple Hearts and promotions.  The  antediluvian scenes were Witt is seen to live in harmony with Pacific  islanders, images which he cherishes and remembers throughout the movie,  even during his last dying moments, are the counterpart of the brutality he  sees during the battle. He is practically the only one who shows any  compassion for the enemy.  Some reviewers have complained this is a movie  that philosophizes about war. That's what makes it so valuable. That ""red  line"" that divides the sheer brutality of war and the awesome beauty of  nature, the higher human sentiments of love and compassion and the lower  brutal ones of hate is the same red line they see at the turn of dawn, when  the peaceful darkness of the night brings forth the dangers of daytime  battle.  This is a grandiose film. Twenty years from now, ""The Thin Red  Line"" will still be regarded as a masterpiece.

The scene shocks most is when a dying Japanese officer told to a  ""gold teeth picking"" US soldier ""Kisama , shinudayo!(You  bastard , go to the hell!)"" and the US soldier can't understand what  that officer said. However, it seems that in war , even the language is a  barrier (the reason why Witt dead--When Witt is surrounded by Japanese  brigade , the Japanese officer told him ""Anata o koro shi nai(We don't  kill you.)"".But Witt don't drop the gun.), the inner words and motion  can still be understanded.

If you have pro-logic (or DVD surround sound) the  brilliance of the sound editing will amaze you.  Coupled with the  technically unsurpassed cinematography of John Toll (and the director's eye  for the camera which is part of Malick's genius), the scenes of battle are  superior to any I've seen, ever.
This is not a war film.  It is a film in  a war setting in which ordinary, frail, callous and caring human beings  wither and die, grow and triumph in the grip of a hopelessly  incomprehensible circumstance -- warfare.  Eschewing easy answers, the film  poses important questions and assumes that you and I are capable of  responding with intelligence, insight and compassion.
Hans Zimmer's  sound track truly weaves together the various elements of this epic film,  and its elegiac, haunting poetry linger in the mind and heart long after  the film is over.
Nick Nolte, John Cusack, Sean Penn and James Caviezel  in particular give outstanding interpretations of complex characters, and  do credit to the wondrous characterizations in James Jones' related novels  (From Here to Eternity and The Thin Red Line).  For those concerned that  Malick may have been overly cerebral in making this film, turn to those  sources and realize that this film is the product of two astoundingly  creative minds in synchrony.  Yes, soldiers actually DO think, wonder,  contemplate, change during the impossible chaos, heroics and degradation of  warfare, and so we see and feel this happen to those we see and hear --  fleetingly or lengthily -- in this film.
Read Stephen King, certainly,  for sheer entertainment -- I do.  But save time for Faulkner, Dostoyevsky,  Garcia-Marquez -- those whose creations further the culture and give  expression to our deepest travail and highest aspirations.  Watch  ""Saving Private Ryan"", certainly, to be entertained (and  reassured by the illusion that the Americans are always good, the enemy  always bad) and to feel good.  But also take the time to experience the  finest cinematic art and all it can offer as an expression and validation  of our humanness.  This film has no equal among American films of the  decade.

What about the medic who is killed after  insisting on going after the gut-shot soldier or the seven men who  eventually take the pillbox?

I bet you  will never have a chance to fight along with captain like Hanks or with  guys shown in SPR, nor have a chance to fight a heroic battle shown in SPR.  Well,I agree that this film seems to be released incomplete, needs to be  modified in some aspects(for concentration), and, evidently, some famous  actors didn't do their best(Or Marlick failed to extract best results from  them).

Malick's film offers a totally different look at the war. The  battleground is a tropical paradise, whereas Private Ryan is cold and  steely grey, provoking an obvious feeling of dread. Malick uses the  background of the battlefield to suggest the ability of man to destroy  nature despite it's obvious beauty. His film is an expansion on similar  themes explored in his near-perfect 'Days of Heaven', a film which also  uses the technique of inner monologue to pull the narrative together.

Sean Penn gives a fine performance that is sadly lost in the  haze as the director wanders off to follow some strange inner voice rather  than giving the picture any sort of comprehensible plot, character  development, or payoff. A multitude of non-sequiteur jump cuts and slow-mo  flashbacks ensure that even what plot there is sinks into the  mire without  a trace.
  I almost walked out of this turkey three times in the  theater, and by the end all that was keeping me going was the hope that the  hero would die horribly and give me at least some satisfaction. That's how  utterly Malick (whose fingerprints are all over this project) fails to make  the viewer care about his main character. Since we don't care about the  characters, we don't care what happens to them, which is the antithesis of  how a war movie is suppose to be made. At the end of ""Glory,"" for  example, characters we have grown to know and admire charge gallantly to  their deaths and we are touched by their loss. No amount of gore can make  us care about a cardboard cutout.

It said a great deal,  sometimes without using a single word. For example the scene were the  soldiers are first walking onto the island and a native walks by without  even looking at them! Once again it made me think of 2001 in the sense that  much of the film could be interpreted in different ways. It was a personal  adventure for everyone who saw it. Some people just got more out of it than  others. You had to put some thought into it to get anything back. Some  people saw a bunch of good actors that had small undeveloped parts that  they couldn't relate to. I saw that same thing as a statement that as a  soldier you are part of a larger machine and that individually you mean  nothing. I loved the scene where one of the soldiers gets a letter from his  beloved wife saying she is leaving him for someone else. Because you know  that that really happened to some of them. They came home to find that  there lives did not wait for them while they were gone. This movie was  brilliant. I can't say enough good things about it. I think it was widely  misunderstood and was wrongfully compared to Saving Private Ryan.

They were two different  kinds of movies and really can not be compared. I think time will reveal  the true genius of this film.

Firstly, the  cinematography is just, frankly, excellent (by cinematographer John Toll).  The movement of the camera through the shoulder high grass, guiding the  audience through the soldiers eyes, is really masterful. Every shot is  crafted to perfection that any one could be a work of art.

I've heard people  complain about the weak script. NO, not weak, different: Everyone expect a  movie(a war movie)with a huge objective. What is wrong with spending time  with soldiers, even if there is no real drama going on between them.  I got  news for you, TRL seemed more realistic to me because it diidn't feel like  I was watching ""Hollywood, american,  money-oriented film"". (For  more on this visit the reviews of ""Saving Private Ryan"") There  was great acting from every actor in hollywood(they all were in the movie;  from Penn to Leto, and Nolte to Clooney). Many complain about not being  able to remember OR feel emotions for any of the characters.  Well, these  just happen to be the narrow-minded people who fell asleep watching  ""Thin Red"", so if they have this little insight, why would I care  about their opinion. Most every movie that is released, have charcter we  care very little about. Plus: can you name every one in Tom Hanks Team ?  ""The Thin Red Line"" is a high note in filmmaking today.  A movie  should entertain and enlighten ones mind. Such films as ""Star Wars,  Badlands, and Days of Heaven, do this.  Thank Mr. Malick, you have caught  my attenion once again.",928454400,,1512,4.6679389312977095
1028689,4,6305438137,"Discard expectations, convention, and all that war films have been in the past: this is a film, like ""Apocalypse Now"" or ""2001"", that avoids the limitations of narrative and character and instead, exists  as a poem. Those looking for heroes, battle plans, and a ""grand  message"" are bound to be bored and disappointed, but I accepted its  intent from the very beginning and therefore had no problem settling in.  Whenever a film strives for philosophical meditation, Americans go wild and  run for the exits. Hey kids, that's OUR fault, not the director's.",928281600,,556,5.0
1028690,1,6305438137,"I am really surprised at how many good reviews this film got here on Amazon.com. I honestly don't know how you could sit down and watch this utterly boring ""masterpiece"" (as the critics hailed it).
The  film starts off boring, and ends boring. And I went to the theater with a  tottaly open mind. I tried to keep telling myself ""Hey, hang in there,  something cool will come."" Well, nothing ""cool"" ever did.  THE THIN RED LINE reminds me of a ride at Disneyland....lots of build-up,  no pay off. Example: The troops get in their landing craft to  heart-pounding music, and speed towards the shores of Guadacanal in a  Private Ryan-esque scene. And when they get to the beaches (still heart  pounding music playing, mind you), the gates of the craft come down, and  the soldiers run into the jungles without a bullet fired.
The stupid  narratives were jumbled and hard to follow. They bore the viewer before  they teach him anything. And I found myself not caring about any of the  characters. I also could have done without the endless running through  grassy hills. It all became pointless.
If my car had not been in the  garage getting repairs at the time, I would have gotten up and left. I even  felt like going to sleep. To make a long review short, I was BORED TO  TEARS.",927936000,2,1277,4.535087719298246

1028692,5,6305438137,"In my opinion, this was easily the best film of 1998 (""Shakespeare in Love"" - are you kidding me!!!).  Malick has again created a magnificent visual canvas upon which to tell his story about  man's  humanity and inhumanity.  For those who say the film is boring, I would  remind them that Malick, like Kubrick, has it right - film is a VISUAL  medium.",927676800,,351,4.492063492063492

Don't expect a shoot em' up, blood and guts movie cause you won't get that however there is a battle that last about an hour. I have never seen this kind of an  approach on a war flick. Most of the others are all the same but this one  had some real thought put into it.

1028694,5,6305438137,"The Thin Red Line is simply the best film ever made.  Not just the best war film, but the best film in history.  The great classics of the past (Citizen Kane, Casablanca, The Third Man) although brilliant and unequaled  by but a few films in over fifty years seem simplistic child's play to Mr.  Malik's masterpiece.  The justification of this is stated by the other  positive reviews written here but there is also much more.  The film takes  the viewer to a place where all is one and existence as generally observed  is purely superficial and none-existent.  Death, love, religion, simplicity  is all brought into one category by The Thin Red Line.  Watching the film  is a truly blissful experience.  This description is also not to undermine  the also fantastic insights into human nature and what goes on in war.  The  film also portrays the fear in the soldiers fighting like no other before  it.",926812800,,903,4.716129032258064
1028695,1,6305438137,"First of all, THIS IS NOT a ""Saving Private Ryan"" genre movie. To sum it up, it is a celluloid calamity. Truly, one of this decade's greatest movie making fiascos. All of the elements were there for a truly  great movie- beautiful setting, human drama, even gifted actors.  Why then,  did it fail? The director was far in above his head (or talent or ability).  The anemic moralization of an immoral subject (war) is tricky at best, and  Thin Red Line is a D- in terms of meaning and storyline. A sorry  disappointment. This movie crossed the thin red line over onto the dung  heap of truly bad movies.",925603200,,602,4.467889908256881

7888911,4,6305438137,"Adrien Brody was mostly written out and then further cut from the final version of this film. He has only a one minute scene. Many notable actors credited with parts in this movie are reduced to cameos--so it is misleading to highlight them as promotional points. . The plot is gripping and often brutal--resembling war itself. Sean Penn and Nick Nolety are excellent. The movie highlights the nastiness of war and the sometimes scheming of officers for personal aggrandisement without regard for enlisted personnel. The sacrifices to take ""hilltops"" is existentially senseless--especially the cost to life & limb. The fear, treachery and self sacrifice in battle are boldy told. Most of all, the men fight for each other--rather than for glory or ""higher principle."" An intelligent and well done film.",1524096000,2,802,5.176923076923077

They depict the elusive out of sight Japanese perfectly, but made a point to show the humanity (as well as inhumanity) of everyone involved on both sides of the war. It also was shot absolutely beautifully, and I find myself wanting to visit either Guadalcanal or Queensland Australia where it was filmed.
