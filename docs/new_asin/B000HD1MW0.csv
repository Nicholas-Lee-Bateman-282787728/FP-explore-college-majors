2634559,4,B000HD1MW0,"""The Blue Light"" is a beautiful fairy tale, a faux Mitteleuropean fable with a Brothers Grimm feel. Junta, played by Leni Riefenstahl, is a beautiful outcast in mid 19th century northern Italy. A child of nature who lives in the mountains, she is believed to be a witch by the townspeople in the valley. She alone can climb to the mysterious blue light that appears on the mountain peak during the full moon. The young men of the village are  as mysteriously drawn to the light as she, but one by one fall to their deaths in their attempts to reach it. Into this mystical little valley comes our young, German traveler who falls in love with Junta but ultimately destroys her in a way I won't reveal.

The story can be interpreted in a lot of ways, I suppose: capitalism vs. tradition, civilization vs. nature, a celebration of incipient fascist primitivism, et al. Like all good fairy tales, symbolism and archtypes abound. However, I like it simply because I think it's beautiful. From Leni Riefenstahl- speaking Italian!- to the mountain to the faces of the Brueghelian peasants, this movie delights the senses and intoxicates the imagination.

For fans of the movie, I recommend getting the CD ""Res Gestae"" by Eric Owens, who has a song called ""Junta"" inspired by this film. Some lines: Another mother's son heeds the call/ Another mother's son scales the wall/ Another mother's son takes a fall/ Another cross is hoisted on the wall. It's a good one.

And for all those hesitant to buy this because of all the reviews criticizing the quality: the new DVD released in 2006 is fine. Those people were referring to some earlier VHS edition. Unfortunately, amazon.com has combined reviews for two essentially different products.",1191369600,29,1729,4.831081081081081
2634560,5,B000HD1MW0,"I'm disappointed that Amazon can't put the right reviews with the right movies.  The ones I have read seem to be several years old and to refer to a public domain VHS copy.  Well, I don't know about the VHS copy,  but the DVD copy is beautiful and  the movie is both moving and a masterpiece.

Mountain climbing films are not the greatest genre ever invented, but you owe it to yourself to see The Blue Light.  If you want to make it a double feature, I would recommend:  The White Hell of Pitz Palu, SOS Iceburg and/or from America, Erich Von Stroheim's Blind Husbands.

Enjoy!",1188432000,31,578,4.386792452830188
8138704,5,B000HD1MW0,I remember seeing it in the theater as a student and loved it. Many years later I bought this DVD and watched it with my 9 year old daughter. We both loved it. Lyrical and beautiful and so Leni!,1501891200,,194,4.0

8138706,5,B000HD1MW0,"One of the most haunting & beautiful films from the ""Mountain Movies,"" so popular in '20's &'30's Germany. Leni Riefenstahal is superb in this Witch story/fairytale. I waited ages to get a copy of this film. Thank you!",1441152000,,218,4.7631578947368425
8138707,5,B000HD1MW0,"When a film ends, do you feel that you are better off having seen it than not? Some films are a waste of my time and others I feel a connection with them and the thought of them stays with me for a while. This film was the latter. When it ended I kept thinking of the name Junta. Leni Reifenstahle was beautiful and by the end I was captivated by this seemingly simple story.

The scenery is magnificent and the acting is well done in the film (I am comparing it to other period acting, not our contemporary style of acting). The disc itself has two versions of the film on it: one is in German with English subtitles and the other is an English silent version of the film (same film with English boards). The German version of the film is the one I watched and it was wonderful. The picture and sound were clear and it looked and sounded great. If you want to compare it to something, watch the English silent version, which I previewed. The English silent version is horrible and you can see that it wasn't remastered. That will help you appreciate the German version more. The film is over 80 years old, so any minor imperfections I noticed (and there were hardly any) are not even worth mentioning.

Films like this need to be watched at the right moment and when you are in the right mood to get the maximum enjoyment from them. I am lucky that PBS used to show old movies in the middle of the night when I was in my late teens and early twenties. The mood was perfect for me at that time in my life (I still love Casablanca after all these years!). I am lucky to have gained an appreciation for early films. I find the stories and acting to be much better than contemporary films. I hope I can pass this appreciation on to my own children.

Strangely I find myself a little disappointed at the same time as being happy to have seen this movie. I will not have the same emotionally high feeling ever again watching it since I now know how the film ends. This is my first Leni Riefenstahl film. Perhaps I can recapture that feeling in a future viewing of another one of her films? I will have to buy another, and wait for the right moment to watch it.",1418342400,6,2155,4.238442822384428
8138708,5,B000HD1MW0,This movie is incredibly rich with symbolism.  The ideals that are reflected... are many times what one sees in the mirror of themselves.,1352246400,,137,4.956521739130435
8138709,5,B000HD1MW0,"The blue light rescues the splendor and the superlative stature of the myth. Junta is a girl who lives far from the crowding world, it's to say a primitive state, surrounded by the nature.

In front of her, we have the village, the rational side of the life who firmly believes she is a witch and associates her with a natural phenomena, the moon turns into blue when the night fails.

Suddenly a man from the city falls in love with her, and she experiences the same feeling. That's why she invites him to share her secret, she has opened the gates of the tragedy.

You must be involved by the mythical aura of the nature in order to be captured by this filmic gem. Otherwise, maybe you'll be dissapointed.

A true masterpiece of the German cinema.",1345852800,,749,4.445255474452555
8138710,5,B000HD1MW0,"I bought a brand new, sealed edition of ""The Blue Light"" (Das Blaue Licht) DVD from a completely reputable Amazon seller, so I have no doubt that this disk was factory-perfect.  But very quickly I discovered that even though this is a ""standard"" DVD, it would not play in my Denon standard DVD player! Denon is a better-than-average brand, which is why I bought it in the first place, and it has the highly-regarded Faroudja chipset.  Either the Denon would not recognize the DVD as even being a DVD, or it would immediately start playing at the beginning of the German version of the film, and then freeze and break down into artifacts within 30 seconds. After that, I cleaned the Denon as thoroughly as I could, although it wasn't dirty, but the same thing happened again and again.

Now for the real surprise!  This same standard DVD played just fine, and looked great when I played it in my Panasonic Blu-ray player -- but ""The Blue Light"" is NOT a Blu-ray movie!  The movie also played just fine on my HP Probook laptop computer, with Windows 7 as the operating system, and using Windows Media Player to play the movie on the computer.

None of this makes any sense to me, but I thought I would mention it. If you run into the same problem, you can be pretty certain that it is not a ""bad copy"" or something like that, but, I don't know what the problem actually is.

As for the movie itself, I enjoyed it thoroughly, and could see right from the beginning that Ms. Riefenstahl was a very gifted, spirited artist who was way ahead of her time. She was a very beautiful woman in the early 1930's and I do not doubt that the men of her time found her to be utterly enchanting, as I do now.",1332288000,12,1692,4.369426751592357
8138711,5,B000HD1MW0,"Extraordinary film from notorious German director Leni Riefenstahl.  Essentially a silent movie, Riefenstahl uses her camera to weave a mystical spell around her simple story.  It is a stunningly beautiful film  Riefenstahl captures the mountains, waterfalls, meadows and woods in all their beauty.  But she also turns a loving eye on the faces of the inhabitants of this glorious setting.  Skillfully she uses light and shadow, clouds and mist to create an ethereal, almost other-worldly atmosphere.

In pursuit of her vision, Riefenstahl spared no one, not her cast, not her crew, and certainly not herself.  No back lots or rear projection for this director!  One can only imagine what they went through during filming.  But their efforts pay off handsomely.

""The Blue Light"" gives a hint at what the world of cinema lost when Riefenstahl opted to throw in her lot with Hitler instead of emigrating as many of her colleagues chose to do rather than serve the Nazi state.  One need look no further than ""Triumph of the Will"" and ""Olympia"" to see why many rank her among the greatest film directors of the twentieth century.  It is a pity she didn't use her remarkable skills and vision for a nobler cause.",1324684800,3,1208,4.896551724137931
8138712,4,B000HD1MW0,"As noted in the Product Description of this 2006 Pathfinder Home Entertainment DVD, two different versions of the film are included on the disc, as well as a stills gallery. The two versions are taken from different prints, neither of which has undergone the sort of thorough restoration process that viewers may have become accustomed to with a few other older films.

The spoken German version, with nonremovable English subtitles, has a total run time of 79' 09"". It is in quite good but not perfect condition, with some amount of fuzziness in the picture. The dialog was redubbed in the studio, as was almost universally done with all early sound films. This print has the original music score by Giuseppe Becce. Although not pristine, both video and audio are entirely acceptable for this lovely and historically important film.

The silent version runs only 52' 19"", even with intertitle cards included, but I haven't tried to compare them to see what scenes have been cut. This print, with truncated credits in English, is in extremely poor condition and is barely watchable. Also it has a different and weirdly inappropriate musical score that sounds rather like circus music. Apparently it's this very bad print transferred to VHS that other reviewers have complained about.",1241222400,14,1283,5.047169811320755
8138713,5,B000HD1MW0,"Seems to me as a great movie of its time! Not much about compicated story, more about feelings. You feel like listing an old black and white photo- album with artistical pictures that actually do move! // Enjoy Pavel",1202860800,4,216,4.564102564102564
