2550909,4,B000F48D5U,"I loved the original Lilo and Stitch, it's my favorite Disney movie of all time. I thought Stitch! the Movie was disappointing, but I think Disney recovered with Stitch has a Glitch and now Leroy and Stitch. I loved how we got to see all the experiments together, and that they banded together against the evil armies of Leroys. I was also pleased that 625 finally got a name, because he has been a staple since Stitch! the Movie. The original Lilo and Stitch will always be my favorite, but Leroy and Stitch was a surprising sequel that makes a great addition to any Disney library. A good family movie to watch over and over on a rainy day!",1151798400,15,642,4.4033613445378155
2550910,3,B000F48D5U,"I was very much looking forward to Leroy and Stitch, but came away quite disappointed. This feature length conclusion to the tv series of Lilo and Stitch, focuses on what would happen when it came time for Lilo and Stitch to say goodbye. That in itself can open up so many possibilities, but unfortunately they were not made the most of here. Granted the film gets off to a great start and some of the action is edge of your seat stuff towards the end, but the love between Lilo and Stitch that we've come to know and love, is simply rushed by here.

This film will be acceptable for most kids I think, but as a big conclusion to a much loved series it is a little disappointing. Still, at least it's not a disaster.

If this is the best that we have as a Lilo and Stitch conclusion, then I'd like another Lilo and Stitch feature please Disney.",1151280000,7,844,4.26875
2550911,5,B000F48D5U,"Yes,I was upset since Lilo & Stitch the series was ending it's 3 year run(pay attention to the movie,Lilo actually confirms that it was a 3 year cycle..hehe),but this is a nice big ""aloha"" to the series. Elvis has some music here again,Lilo's very sad since her alien ohana leaves ....eh Hammterwheel(""No viel,like the delicious meats!""),getting out of prison,Leroy & Stich fighting the heck outta each other....eh go watch it! I reccomened this,since you will see experiment 625 getting his true name,and stay tuned for the credits because:all 626 experiments are listed,names included! Plus you may(as I did) get all misty-eyed,like Lilo in the movie.

A great aloha indeed,even though aloha means goodbye,it also means hello,and it will always come back to you.",1151193600,3,764,5.211382113821138
2550912,5,B000F48D5U,"After being seriously disappointed by the Little Mermaid 2 and Mulan 2, I was skeptical about this sequel.  What a pleasant surprise it turned out to be!  Also, I didn't watch the series, and was still easily able to pick up what had happened since the last movie.

Unlike some other sequels, it sounds like the original cast is back in its entirety.  There is an actual plot, engaging and funny, and it fits well into the feel of the original.  My almost-11-month-old actually watched a good part of it, and we both enjoyed it. I'll get this one.  It's better than Stitch Has a Glitch, on-par with the first movie.

The extras include a game I didn't try and a bonus episode of the series.",1151107200,20,690,4.428571428571429
2550913,4,B000F48D5U,"I was a bit sad when I heard that Lilo and Stitch: the Series was ending.  I loved the original movie, and consider it to be Disney's best work since The Lion King (possibly even better, in a way).  So I was looking for something special in Leroy and Stitch, as a send-off to Chris Saunders' little blue alien and friends.

After watching Leory and Stitch, I feel I was well rewarded.

A few parts of the plot were a bit contrived - but we are talking about a straight-to-video children's show.  However, it reinforced the feeling of both fun and seriousness that made the original such a wonderful film.

I won't reveal anything regarding the plot; the basics can be read in the synopsis here on Amazon.  I will say, however, that it was a nice send-off for the experiment ohanna - and it did make me just a little misty-eyed at times when I realized that it was truly the end of the series.  I would consider Lilo and Stitch the most successful of Disney's more recent releases - and this is a fine end to the story.  Goodbye, Lilo! See ya, Reuben (watch the movie and you'll understand)! Aloha, Stitch! We'll miss you, you loveable, cute 'n' fluffy rascal.",1151020800,5,1159,4.429245283018868

As an adult, they are good, but my 7-year-old son loves them all.  And the takeaway is that he says family comes first and puts that into practice.  For that alone, he can watch them as much as he wants.

I like that all of Stitch's cousins are in this one.  I wish they had done more with them.  And despite reviews I read, this doesn't have a bad ending.",1438128000,,515,3.9901960784313726

2550951,3,B000F48D5U,"If I hadn't watched the TV series, I wouldn't have known what was going on in this third entry in the Stitch films.  In an offhand fashion, it's mentioned that Lilo & Stitch have collected all of Jumba's experiments and rehabilitated them.  They're now living in Hawaii and serving useful purposes for the locals.  In quick order, the friends Lilo, Stitch, Jumba, and Pleakly are split up and a new threat is inserted into the story.  Apparently, there's an EVIL mastermind named Dr. Hamsterviel who wants to destroy Stitch so he has Jumba make a twin then he clones it and names it Leroy.
Sadly, this movie doesn't have the same heart and soul that the first film had.  It feels like you need to watch the entire TV series first and them this abrupt end to the entire series (film and otherwise).",1418515200,,797,4.545454545454546

2550969,5,B000F48D5U,"Lilo and Stitch are by far my favorite characters in the Disney world.  From Stitch's ""cute and fluffy"" to Lilo's unique and sometimes all too insightful view of the world they head a story line that is so anti-disney that it is beyond amazing. Leroy and Stitch is in keeping with this tradition and brings together all the ""cousins"" in a climatic reaffirmation that they/we all have one place we truly belong.",1388275200,,410,4.694444444444445

2550975,5,B000F48D5U,"Leroy & Stitch is the 4th film in the Lilo & Stitch Franchise. This is the final film in the franchise, and it is also the conclusion to the TV series.

The film starts off with Lilo, Stitch, Pleakly, and Jumba being awarded for capturing all 625 experiments. Stitch, Pleakly, and Jumba get jobs outside of Earth, but they decide to stay on Earth so that Lilo won't be sad. We also see Gantu leaving 625 to go and find Hamsterviel. He tells off 625, then he leaves quickly. Soon after, Lilo decides that Stitch, Pleakly, and Jumba should go do their new jobs, then we get a really emotional little scene between Lilo and Stitch.

Back on Earth, Lilo decides to visit 625 to ask him to contact Stitch for her. She soon befriends him, and she decides to name him Reuben.

Later on, Hamsterviel forces Jumba to create an army of experiments called ''Leroys''. Hamsterviel wants to use the Leroy army in order to destroy the experiments. But Lilo, Stitch, Pleakly, Jumba, Reuben, Gantu, and all 624 experiments decide to battle against his army.

At the end of the film, Lilo takes a group photo of herself, and all of her Ohana. All of the experiments, Nani, David, Pleakly, Jumba, and even Mertle join in the photo.

This is a really fun and cute movie, and it is also really lighthearted. We also learn several things about certain characters. We learn that Mertle doesn't have a dad, which may be the reason why she's mean. Gantu and Reuben become good in this film, and we see a completely different side of them. Gantu and Reuben are usually bullies, but in this film, Reuben is extremely nice to Lilo after she shows him compassion, and Gantu has a change of heart after Hamsterviel fires him.

This is a really enjoyable film, and it's a great conclusion to the franchise.",1381104000,,1776,4.534375

But in this case, the power of Disney has overcome much of the concern raised from straight to DVD releases.

And now here's where it ends

This is the time to say goodbye

To Lilo and her friends

In the series, one by one

Experiments were shown

How to control their special skills

And come into their own

Jumba goes back to his lab

And starts another creature

Pleakley gets a cushy job

But wants to be a teacher

Stitch commands a battleship

A brand new big red brute

If you love men in uniform

You'll think Stitch really cute

Gantu frees Doc Hamsterviel

I can't guess his intent

They go to Jumba's lab and steal

his new experiment

Using it like Jango Fett

They make a batch of clones

Trained to kill without a qualm

Just like the Star Wars drones

Like Obi Wan and Anakin

Leroy and Stitch do battle

Doc Hamsterviel intends to slay

Experiments like cattle

But Jumba has a back up plan

A pelvis shaking ploy

When Stitch straps on the old guitar

And sings Aloha Oe

If you watched the TV shows

You need to get this one

If not just rent it for your kids

And consider your job done

2551020,1,B000F48D5U,"I just rented this. I was hoping this would be better than the lackluster 2nd Lilo & Stitch, but I was wrong. This was SOOOOOOOOOOOO BAD! As a matter of fact, I think this is even as bad as the 2nd one.

Here we go with the plot...

Lilo, Stitch, and Jumba catch the experiments and find their homes. Gantu has left earth and frees Dr. Hamsterviel out of jail, and together they create Leoroy, who will dominate the earth.

I really hated this film. If the 2nd one sucked, why see this?

AVOID AT ALL COSTS!",1161993600,5,507,4.195876288659794
2551021,4,B000F48D5U,"If you're a fan of the ""Lilo & Stitch"" franchise, as I am, it'll be with some sadness that you'll watch this film, knowing that it marks the end of ""Lilo & Stitch: The Series"", and the supposed end to the entire L&S franchise.

This should, however, not divert you from enjoying the film, which goes a considerable distance to sending off its base, considerably.

Being presented in the animation of ""The Series"" and ""Stitch! The Movie"", and with the voices of Daveigh Chase and Chris Sanders intact, ""Leroy & Stitch"" tells the story of Lilo's alien companions, following an official pardon, leaving Earth to lead lives of their own on different planets (Jumba returns to his lab, Pleakley is employed at a university, and Stitch is made commander of the BRB - Big Red Battleship), while Dr. Hmsterviel, with the help of Gantu, escapes prison and manufactures an army of a new Experiment (a prototype of Jumba's; essentially, an upgraded Stitch).

Employing all of the characters featured throughout films and Series (including the Grand Council Woman and all of the Experiments), the film moves to give a climatic send-off to The Series by presenting an all-or-nothing scenario, and a Hmsterviel reaching his pinnacle of nastiness.

Though the title seems to imply it, the film by no means excludes Lilo, or diminishes her role as a main character. Stitch's dialougue, however, which has often been one of the prime sources of amusement in the past, seems diminished, with him giving less monologue than in any of the other films. Likewise, this film relies a bit annoyingly on 3D animation when it comes to spaceships.

In return, however, fans are treated to the first true ""fight scene"" of the franchise, between Stitch and Leroy battling it out in Jumba's lab. Another personal favorite of mine includes the climatic musical performance of ""Aloha Oe"", and the full induction of 625 as an essential character.

Shortly said, it's a fun film, climatic to The Series and worthy send-off, if that's what it is. It still isn't equal to the original ""Lilo & Stitch"" or ""L&S2"", but it enunciates on the potential of The Series, and manages to pull off a good film. Fans should definitely get their hands on it.",1157587200,17,2208,4.843501326259947
2551022,5,B000F48D5U,"What a fantastic movie!!!!!!!

Leroy and Stitch blew me away!!! I was expecting it to be terrible, the prospect of Lilo and Stitch splitting up, but it wasn't what I expected!!!!

The council doesnt split them up, it kind of happens naturally because all of the ""ohana"" kinda lose sight of what's most important...now i have to say i disagree that stitch would be so willing to leave Lilo after all they have been through but it was all done tastefully and in a way that didn't offend me as a diehard lilo and stitch fan....

Leroy was awesome in design, deplorable in attitude but he did exhibit alot of stitch-like traits which at times were kind of cute.

It's got some hillarious moments...watch for a line from Pleakley ""I'm wearing the wig!"" ....I thought I was gonna die laughing at that...

Animation in some parts of stitch himself was kinda poor but that's a minor annoyance....the story here was extremely strong. This film had everything that Stitch! The Movie lacked.

It had tons of emotion, a strong story, tons of action and even a few nail-biting moments that kept me on the edge of my seat. Honestly I have to say that despite my reservations towards the TV animation crew in the past, I truly felt that this movie couldn't have been done better (except animation-wise) had it been done by a studio crew like Lilo and Stitch 2 was!

Impressed...thoroughly and completely....I would have liked to have seen the original ""Leroy"" turned to good, as he is just as cute as stitch and would have made a fantastic ""good"" experiment, but oh well.

The ending was hillarious as well....Jailhouse Rock with hamsterviel and all the Leroy clones...omg....so original!

This was the ultimate series-based movie. Blows STM right out of the water, and ranks right up there with the original and Stitch Has A Glitch....if you haven't seen it already....run...dont walk...to the store and buy it...or order it right here on Amazon!

I truly hope this is not the official end of the stitch franchise at Disney, and that in the future we do get some more movies...but even if we dont, this movie was a powerful, interesting, captivating, emotional, edge-of-your-seat and attention grabbing close to the series and certainly the best thing the television crew has churned out relating to Stitch to date.

Cant stop gushing here about this film....DO NOT be put off by the thought of lilo and stitch separating, don't let it prevent you from watching this, it all works out in the end, and the voyage along the way will be among some of the best scenes any stitch fan will have seen among the 4 movies and series put out thus far.
