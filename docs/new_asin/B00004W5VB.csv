8041191,5,B00004W5VB,"Deer Creek, Red Rocks, Shoreline are all were wonderful places to see the Dead but nothing captures the experience like spending 4-5 days at Alpine Valley.  This DVD lets you appreciate how much the Dead enjoyed it also.  Having been to this show, it brought back not just the music but the people and the environment it created.  Putting 45,000 people in 37,000 seats without one incident shows you the spirit of the Dead.  Bid you good night and standing on the moon are the most powerful in a wonderful show.  The three DVD set is a great investment and keepsake.  Enjoy!!!",982713600,8,576,4.598039215686274
8041192,5,B00004W5VB,"I had originally wanted the long-awaited release from the Grateful Dead Video Vault - View From the Vault. I was at the Louisville, KY show and the Pittsburgh show, and was interested in having View From the Vault on video. Then, I discovered the DVD boxed set that is known as Live Dead the Grateful Dead in Concert. What accompanies the 1990 Pittsburgh show are 2 previously released video gems, Downhill from Here (1989 Alpine Valley) and Ticket to New Years (1987 Oakland Coliseum). There is no better way to immediately amass a Grateful Dead concert video collection. The video quality is scary, it's like having 5th row seats at each show. Definately recommended to fans and those that wish they'd have seen the Dead live.",971568000,26,728,4.785714285714286
8041193,5,B00004W5VB,"(For the non-fan) Okay, so you've never seen the Grateful Dead apart from the rather awful press from the media. So maybe a friend or relative played you a few tapes of live performances that still did not do it for you. So you wonder what all the hype is about. This collection will give you an idea. These live performances will show you that just a bunch of guys were better together than they were by themselves. The basic ""whole is greater than the parts"" idea. This collection showcases the band over an incredible three year period where the music was fresh and inventive, they were pouring all of their earnings (which were amazingly high) into an even better sound and light show, and they walked out on stage like any ""Average Joe."" Each show has those moments that we, as Deadheads, lived for. Actually, these shows have quite a bit of that magic. Watch the jams unfold that always eluded you on the tapes that my bretheren have played for you over the years. They band isn't exactly perfect, but when they shine, they shine....",969408000,16,1039,4.561497326203209
