7991862,2,B00009MEC1,"Not to take anything away from star Mark Feuerstein, who's quite good here, but what attracted me to this film was a rare acting role for director James Toback. He only has a couple of scenes, but they're pretty funny. The film is almost worth checking out just to hear how he pronounces phallus.

Ralph Gigante (Feuerstein) is an ad whiz with a very active sex life. Each night brings him a new conquest and in the mornings he can't wait to relive every sweaty detail with his best friend (Ben Weber). Both his friend and their boss (Dabney Coleman) envy Ralph's active sex life and only wish they were in his place. That is why they are so shocked when Gigante decides to renounce his swinging ways in an effort to prove he's more than just a playboy. Part of the reason for his sudden change of heart is the arrival of a new co-worker named Elizabeth (Amy Redford). Elizabeth has been brought in to oversee Ralph's latest ad campaign. The two share an attraction, but Elizabeth is well aware of his reputation and refuses to act on it. Ralph is determined to settle down and convince her that he's really a sensitive,caring guy. He even vows to give up meaningless sex for her. But when the model (Ali Larter) from his latest campaign enters his life, Ralph finds himself being tested. Can Gigante change his low down ways? Can he stop sleeping around and enter a committed relationship with a woman he cares about? Who cares.

The film plays like a male version of 'Sex and the City' only without the benefit of smart writing and engaging supporting characters. Weber, Skipper from 'Sex and the City', is pretty entertaining though playing basically the same character that he does on the show. It also winds up copying various plot points in films like '40 Days and 40 Night' and 'What Women Want', which Feuerstein co-starred in. He's a romantic comedy veteran which is why it's nice to see him headline his own movie. He's a charming and likable guy who's a good actor if given the right material. It's too bad he's forced to act out dumb sex comedy cliches here. Him and Redford have zero chemistry which makes the romance angle mighty uninteresting. Given the choice between her and Ali Larter, I might ditch the zero and get with the 'Hero'. If you're a fan of Feuerstein then by all means check the film out, but if you're looking for a cute and clever romantic comedy you can do better than this.",1267315200,,2408,4.546082949308755

Kublan's ""Giving it Up"" is a movie which is scarce in the indie field. A romantic comedy, rumored to be the worst, sloppiest, unentertaining and most formulaic of the entire genre.

But very surprisingly, ""Giving it Up"" is a smarter, more-thinking person's romantic comedy. A movie that seems to have filtered out the obnoxious slapstick, trite plot points, dumb characters, monotone dialouge and Julia Roberts and Meg Ryan's routines.

Oh, there are quite a few cliches' in this movie, all right. The playboy who's tired of the game and wants to settle down and develop as a person, the bookish love interest who has no patience for his antics, the sexist supporting characters, the geeky best friend, the unobtainable finally obtained... only to realize that...

And although it sounds like the storyline from ""What Women Want"" (which also featured Feuerstein), no two movies could possibly be more polar opposite.

But ""Giving it Up"" is more than that. It doesn't rely entirely on that as so many other rom-coms do.

""GIU"" is a well-played, thoughtfully-written, smartly concieved look at men, women and their views on sex and drelationships.

In ""Giving it Up,"" a New York advertsing executive who specializes in selling sex to sell products is living the ""almost ideal existance."" He has devoted his life to attracting the opposite sex.

And it seems to be working. He has a new stranger in his bed every night. He's making fat cheddar. His hard-nosed, sexist boss (Dabney Coleman ""9 to 5,"" ""Tootsie,"" ""Recess: School's Out"" and ""You've Got Mail"") loves him. His apartment is lavish and full of cosmetics to polish his vessel and keep it clean. And his superhuman libido fuels his creative fires.

Enter his new boss, Elizabeth, who has heard of him and his reputation. She's smart and genuinely attractive. And quite down to earth. Ralph (Mark Feuerstein ""Woman on Top"" and ""What Women Want""), the playboy in question is instantly smitten with her. But she's heard the word on the street and smiles, giving him the brush off.

Ralph is obsessed. He wants her. He can have every woman except the one he truly wants. Ain't it always the way? Ralph's less-lucky-in-love buddy, Peter (Ben Weber-- ""Twister"" and TV's ""Sex in the City"") asks Ralph why? Why does he want to give up the life? Apparently, Ralphie boy feels empty. He decides to ""give it all up.""

He's the Falling Casanova. He tries to go celibate. He meets up with Elizabeth and informs her of his newfound desire to live a life with something besides sex and even tries to win her over with his outside sex-interests. Like his joy for Billy Wilder's Cary Grant-Audrey Hepburn classic ""Love in the Afternoon.""

Kublan's script is smart in a ""Sex in the City""-type of way. Full of realsitic conversations between men and women about dating, relationships, sex and their own views and look at it all.

The cast is paticularly strong for an indepenedent film. Feuerstein is a real charmer, Weber and James Lesure (From ""For Your Love"") are convincing and likeable as his best friends. Ari Larter as the foul and lecherous super-supermodel Amber is also good for a few laughs. Amy Redford is really 100% believable as a smart, intellegent, confident (and beautiful) businesswoman who hates her self a bit for falling for this falling Casanova.

See it alone for the near Oscar-worthy performance of the magnificent Dabney Coleman, more hard-nosed, sexist and snarling than ever.

Whatever it's called, wherever you live: ""Giving It Up,"" ""No Sex 4U."" A rose by literally any other name. Or by it's original title: ""Casanova Falling.""

It's worth falling for....

7991864,1,B00009MEC1,"I was looking for a fun rompy romantic comedy.  What I got was flaccid mediocrity.  It was poorly acted, had unappealing characters, a choppy plot, really, really bad cinimatography and awful sound quality. I was kind of bored and dissappointed considering the great cast and the potential for rollicking ""Sex and the City"" type fun. What happens is this ad exec sleeps with a different woman every night. At least he feels bad that he can't remember their names.  He falls for a new woman in his office, but pretends not to be attracted to her because she's ""bookish,"" which she isn't at all.  He sleeps with her anyway. He also has a thing for this beautiful model who he can only admire if her imperfections are airbrushed out.  Suddenly, he discovers he's lonely.  The bookish woman suggests he see a shrink.  The shrink is a creep, but our lonely guy continues to see him.  And watching him sit around with his friends talking about their sex lives is as cringing as fingernails on a chalkboard. The Sex Addicts group he joins is mind-numbingly awful.  He realizes he's in love with bookish woman while in bed with the ""woman of his dreams,"" the model, and so he decides to become celebate to win his new love's heart.  It only goes downhill from there.  It really wants to be an endearing, charming movie, but falls very short.  Don't waste your time or money.",1092873600,11,1366,4.599173553719008
7991865,1,B00009MEC1,"This movie knows that it is mostly worthless.  It was never intended to rack up positive critic's reviews.  Instead, it is 90 min or so of uninspired reflection wrapped in a pretty package.  That packaging, of course, is the lovely Ali Larter.  The strategy is to paste Ms. Larter over the majority of the cover, and try to dupe those browsing the video store that her screen time will be relatively proportional to her spot on the cover.  This is not the case, and her one sexy scene was diluted and weak, positivly PG-13 by todays standards.  If you can think of any other reason to watch this movie (Good Morning, Miami fans perhaps) let me know.  Until then, don't judge todays DVDs by their covers.",1061164800,7,703,4.531746031746032
