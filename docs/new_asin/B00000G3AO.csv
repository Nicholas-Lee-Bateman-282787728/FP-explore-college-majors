7908773,4,B00000G3AO,"Gene Autry highlighted his famous theme song as the title of this movie. The film features plenty of the genial but sensible Autry persona, some good comic relief by Smiley Burnette (who would have thought he could sing while standing on his head?), and some great action, especially in the denouement when Gene, his young charge, and a professional gambler who has decided to switch sides, hole up in a jail which is being attacked, then is set on fire, by the villain and his henchmen.

Addison Richards does a star turn -- actually, he steals the picture -- as gambler Duke Winston, a smart, semi-bad guy with basically good instincts. Mary Lee shows us again that she was right up there with Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin as a teen-aged singer and actress of the 1940s. Jacqueline Wells is OK as her big sister, who is Gene's love interest; and Edward Norris does well as Tom Bennett, young New York-raised playboy who inherits his father's ranch and his foreman, Gene Autry.

The film features some great riding by both Autry and Richards, and two brawl scenes, one in front of a New York City nightclub at the start, the other in a saloon in the Western town Autry and Burnette take Norris to.

The only thing that kept me from giving this Autry feature five stars, was the music. Yes, it sounds odd to say that about a Gene Autry movie. The singing is great, which was standard in the Singing Cowboy's pictures -- but, daggone it, there is just too much of it! In a movie 72 minutes long, there are eight songs shoehorned in. That's an average of one every nine minutes -- more, actually, as the title song is performed twice. On a couple of occasions, the songs simply slow down the story, for no real purpose except that Gene's fans loved to hear him and Mary Lee sing together. If the number of songs had been limited to six, the movie would have been better.

But, that's a minor complaint about a B-Western which was one of Autry's best for Republic Pictures. I highly recommend it.",1328745600,2,1995,4.518005540166205

Date of Death: 2 October 1998 - Studio City, Los Angeles, California

Special footnote, Orvon Gene Autry was an American performer who gained fame as The Singing Cowboy on the radio, in movies and on television --- Discovered by film producer Nat Levine in 1934, he and Burnette made their film debut for Mascot Pictures Corp. ""In Old Santa Fe"" as part of a singing cowboy quartet; he was then given the starring role by Levine in 1935 in the 12-part serial ""The Phantom Empire"" --- Shortly thereafter, Mascot was absorbed by the formation of Republic Pictures Corp. and Autry went along to make a further 44 films up to 1940, all B westerns in which he played under his own name, rode his horse Champion, had Burnette as his regular sidekick and had many opportunities to sing in each film --- Autry became the top Western star at the box-office by 1937, reaching his national peak of popularity from 1940 to 1942. His Gene Autry Flying ""A"" Ranch Rodeo show debuted in 1940 --- Gene Autry is the only celebrity to have five stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one in each of the five categories maintained by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce --- Radio, Films, Recordings, Television and Live Theater.

2. Smiley Burnette (aka: Lester Alvin Burnette)
Date of Birth: 18 March 1911 - Summum, Illinois
Date of Death: 16 February 1967 - Encino, California

Second special footnote, Lester Alvin (Smiley) Burnette an American singer-songwriter who could play as many as 100 different musical instruments, was a successful comedy actor in Western films over three decades --- The popularity of Burnette's Frog Millhouse character, with his trademark floppy black hat, was such that when Autry left for World War II service he did sidekicks duties with Eddie Dew, Sunset Carson and Bob Livingston, plus nine other films with Roy Rogers. After leaving Republic Pictures in 1944, Burnette became the sidekick to Charles Starrett at Columbia Pictures in the long Durango Kid series. Starrett starred in the series from 1944 until 1952, and that pairing resulted in more than 50 films. After the Starrett series was over, Burnette joined Autry for his final six films, all released by Columbia Pictures in 1953.

7908776,5,B00000G3AO,"We bought this, along with other English-language videos, so that our two young sons can keep up their English while attending German schools. After all (as I've observed), TV (not schools) is the reason that English is so widespread and better-spoken in Scandinavia than elsewhere in Europe. This video was played so often (consequently driving one of their older half-sisters nuts)  that it should be worn out by now. Both boys soon could sing all the songs in it, in sequence. It was later succeeded in popularity by Melody Ranch. Some other recommendations: Popeye (cartoons and movie), Midway, Lonesome Dove, Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig, and, from the German side, Die Augsburger Puppinkist.",1013731200,4,693,5.132743362831858
7908777,5,B00000G3AO,"Back In The Saddle Again is one of the all time greats when it comes to an Autry film.  As usual Autry portrays the role of moral and ethical proportions.  The plot is about something we are all familiar with.  Pollution of rivers and streams due to copper mining.  It has great action and a good moral value is displayed. Along with the wonderful acting and singing of America's Favorite Cowboy, you also have the comedy of Smiley Burnette at His best.  They even give you a glimpse of Madison Square Gardens at the beginning of the movie.  This, in my opinion could be an actual footage of the personal performance and rodeo's that Autry did when he was the first one to ever play to a sell out crowd at Madison Square Gardens.  It also shows what modern film technology can do for these old westerns.  I have it from a good source that this film was restored using 7 versions collected from across the country and they did a great job.  So if you want to give you children and family something to watch that has plenty of western excitement and a good dose of morals let them watch this movie and they will find that ""The Good Guy in the White Hat always wins""!",980467200,11,1164,4.3271889400921655
