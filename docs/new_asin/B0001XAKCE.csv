2042566,4,B0001XAKCE,"The cover might look cheesy and the plot might sound a little hokey, but don't write this movie off! It is amazing. You have to go with it. Don't sit there and analyze it or say how that will never happen. Just watch it as a love story via Romeo and Juliet or West Side Story. Don't scoff at the music, but just go with the flow. This movie is not one to take all that seriously. Just enjoy it for the decent acting (especially by James McAvoy) and the soundtrack which makes this movie quite special.",1206748800,3,501,4.175257731958763
2042567,5,B0001XAKCE,"All I can say is...WOW!!!  I have seen like one Bollywood movie before so I already know what to expect. Dubbed singing, sudden blurps of music. You gotta just let go and enjoy the unique sounds of Indian music and the cinematic style.  There are moments of incredible beauty.  I bought this because I have recently grown interest in UK shows and films as well as James McAvoy's body of work.  There are moments where he is so ridiculously odd you can't help but laugh at him.  Every great actor has got to start somewhere and this is pretty bold and daring. His quality still shows.  If you are bored with the typical super polished super safe Hollywood stuff...try this. If you have never seen Bollywood this is a lovely introduction into this world. Take a chance... you may actually have a good time!",1203811200,4,804,4.548611111111111
2042568,4,B0001XAKCE,"This movie is suprisingly engaging. Though a simple plot, the subject matter is timeless. The movie was done tastefully and unlike American similar movies, done without sex and violence. Nice music, uplifting and entertaining.",1203379200,2,226,5.676470588235294
2042569,5,B0001XAKCE,"Are you like me when it comes to wandering around your local video store? Do you pick up one DVD case after another closely surveying the cover, or reading the description on the back in search of some undiscovered cinematic gem you've never heard of before? Do you trust that gut feeling, that occasional twinge of intuition that urges you to take a chance and rent something unknown?

That's exactly how I came upon the obscure little gem from '02, `Bollywood Queen.' I absolutely fell in love with this movie just minutes into my first viewing. While this is by no means a big budget production, it's as good as one. The plot is solid, the acting excellent and the female star of the movie Preeya Kalidas is absolutely beautiful, which is a major pre-requisite for any guy to enjoy a romantic film.  Last but certainly not least I must mention the music which really lifts the movie to another level. It's an excellent Indian soundtrack displaying an imaginative blending of traditional and modern with a large dose of whimsy for good measure.

This is one of those films that make up for all the films you took a chance on that let you down. `Bollywood Queen' is definitely a keeper, My Highest Recommendation!",1169164800,15,1214,4.663551401869159
2042570,4,B0001XAKCE,"I just happened to rent this out of the blue, and was pleasantly suprised. This doesn't have the biggest budget obviously, so the dance and song numbers can be underwhelmingly. But it makes for a sweet romantic comedy with a little bollywood fun thrown in. If you liked Bride and Prejudice, then you'll like this bollywood-lite film also.",1123718400,8,338,4.844827586206897
2042571,5,B0001XAKCE,"when i first watched it i thought it was pretty boring but then

i watched it again and i think it's pretty good. i love the music, it's very beautiful. i recremend this movie to any one

but if you think the beginning is boring hold out until the end

thats when it gets better. i think this movie is great.",1114300800,4,308,4.016393442622951

8017882,4,B0001XAKCE,"The blue eyed redheaded Celt meets the beautiful Indian girl
(brought up right there in London) in a garment
industry side battle ( two families divided by a commercial war).
The sparks fly and the ending isn't Shakespeare...
The heart is in the right place and if Bollywood could pick up the blues,
they might really have something?
I liked it because she reminded me of a Mexican girl I know
who is as talented. It reminds me most of a Elvis Presley type musical
movie.",1229040000,2,471,4.488372093023256
8017883,3,B0001XAKCE,"I've recently become interested in James McAvoy's work.  I've seen most of his later work, and couldn't resist purchasing this film to see how he fit into a Bollywood film.

The story is a simple one -- a sort-of West Side Story, but without the tragic end.

I'm somewhat familiar with Bollywood-type films.  I know they are like the old Hollywood musicals with the cast breaking out into song at various times in the story.  Bollywood Queen is no different.

When I first watched the film I laughed out loud when ""Jay"" (James McAvoy) started singing.  It was dubbed, of course, but he did a good job of lip-syncing to the music.  Some of the things McAvoy had to do in the name of Bollywood were silly, but he went with it, and seemed to be enjoying himself.  He seems very comfortable in his skin.  You can see he realizes that whatever the part, you give it your best.

I found myself enjoying the film.  I ended up watching it 3 times!  ""Jay"" and ""Gina"" have chemistry.  I liked the storyline.  I'm a sucker for romatic comedies.  James McAvoy is very charismatic and his talent, even in this early film, is obvious!

Bottom line -- I wanted to see more of James McAvoy's work, so I purchased this film, and I'm very glad I did.",1220918400,13,1232,4.404444444444445
8017884,1,B0001XAKCE,"This is a poorly produced film that is either misinformed or misleading about the nature of documentary history and documentary production. The film 's makers have no sense of the essay form history of documentary film, or the fact that Moore's techniques, in fact, fit squarely within the long history of documentary work since the early 20th century.",1219449600,,352,5.086206896551724
