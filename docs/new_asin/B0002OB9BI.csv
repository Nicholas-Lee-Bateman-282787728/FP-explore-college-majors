The flipping techniques are very good and easy to follow and understand, however it seems like they talked mostly about how the knife was made and pacific cutlery and less about the history of the knife and fighting techniques. Dan Inosanto does not give a very good history  on the knife in this video is only maybe 5 seconds. And goes the same with fighting techniques. The book gave a more detailed info on the history. The entire video is only 45 min long. To short for me, but not bad. Its not the worst video Ive ever seen, but I am sure the other DVD by the military guy might be better. I will buy that when I have more money. This video is not all that bad, but could have been better.",1315440000,,729,4.170212765957447
