Having come from a great family of tabla players, but then becoming a djembe player of repute, its been very interesting to see how he has developed this oral percussion tradition and then applied it to the Djembe and made it his own...especially adding finger technique in addition to conventional ""hand"" /slap techniques.

The live studio gig is very high def and well made, and the instruction disc is equally informative and helpful..especially his favorite grooves, which include bhangra and others.  I have thoroughly enjoyed it",1383004800,,607,5.06
8454824,3,B0052YX0R4,"Nice performance video and demos. The ""tutorials"" are pretty much worthless. Don't buy this thinking you're going to learn to play a bunch of tabla rhythms on djembe.",1329609600,3,166,4.964285714285714
8454825,3,B0052YX0R4,"There is no doubt that you can do a lot of advanced drumming on one single drum that has three tones in it, no matter if this drum is called a djembe, a darbuka, a timbau or what ever. Mr. Qureshi shows this very impressively on the first CD. Also there is no doubt that if you want to transfer Indian rhythms to such an instrument you are well adviced to consider the different types of strokes that Mr. Qureshi presents on the second DVD. On the other hand, if you are new to djembe/timbau and the like and first of all want to get the basics down and learn a number of good rhythms to accompany a jazz band, pop band or whatever with, you should probably start with some other material and get some personal instruction with an experienced teacher. In other countries of the world people work with different syllable systems.  For example I have got my basic training with a teacher from Ghana who named the various strokes quite differently.

In this DVD you are going to see how far you can get with this way of drumming, and that actually is quite impressive. You also get an impression of the precision and the discipline Indians apply to their Art. An experienced drummer may get valuable inspiration for his further development of whatever style he's working with.

You are however not going to get any basic drum training in these DVDs. They are not for beginners. My humble suggestion to the highly professional percussionist Taufiq Qureshi would be to make another DVD in the same style for beginners and for people with main interest in ""latin sounding"" or ""pop style"" drumming. The idea of using the djembe or a djembe-like drum as all-purpose percussion and teaching this with the same discipline and systematic like any other instrument (saxophone or piano) definitely is good. Every musician should be able to do some basic drumming to extend his understanding of rhythmic music. For this purpose however you would need a somewhat simpler approach than the one presented here.

That said, the DVDs are awesome. There's a lot of good drumming and they are definitely worth the price.",1313712000,5,2099,4.6802168021680215
